Landmark Judgment on Appeal Procedure under the Maintenance Act
Suresh Chandra, J This is an application for special leave to appeal in terms of Article 128 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read with s.9 of the High Court of Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No.19 of 1990. When this application was taken up for support a preliminary objection was raised by Counsel for the Respondent as to the maintainability of the application in view of s.14(2) of the Maintenance Act No.37 of 1999 . Both parties made oral submissions and thereafter filed written submissions regarding the preliminary objection that was raised.
The Respondent had made an application in the Magistrates Court of Marawila against the Petitioner seeking maintenance for herself in the sum of Rs. 20,000 per month. Thereafter she had amended her application and sought an increased amount of maintenance of Rs.60,000 per month. After inquiry by the learned Magistrate, the Petitioner was ordered to pay Rs.5,000 per month as maintenance. Thereafter the Respondent appealed against the said order of the Magistrates Court to the High Court of Chilaw seeking a variation of the Order. The High Court after hearing submissions of the parties varied the Order of the learned Magistrate by increasing the maintenance to be paid by the Petitioner to the Respondent to Rs.25,000 per month. It is against this 4 judgment that the Petitioner has filed the present application to this Court seeking Special Leave to Appeal.
The preliminary objection raised by the Respondent requires a consideration of the provisions of the Maintenance Act No.37 of 1999.
S. 14(2) of the said Act states as follows
Any person dissatisfied with an Order made by the High Court in the exercise of its Appellate jurisdiction under this section, may prefer an appeal there from to the Supreme Court, on a question of law, with the Leave of the High Court, and where such leave is refused, with the Special Leave of the Supreme Court, first had and obtained. (emphasis added)
The submission of Counsel for the Respondent was to the effect that before seeking special leave from the Supreme Court a party aggrieved by the decision of the High Court regarding the Appeal from the Magistrates Court should in the first instance seek such leave from the High Court, and it is only on a refusal of such an application that an application for leave could be made to the Supreme Court.
It would be relevant to consider the provisions of S.9 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No.19 of 1990 which states that
Subject to the provisions of this Act or any other law, a person aggrieved by -
(a) A final order, judgment, decree or sentence of a High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction vested in it by paragraph (3) (b) of Article 154P of the Constitution or section 3 of this Act or any other law, in any matter or proceeding whether civil or criminal which involved a substantial question of law, may appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court if the 5 High Court grants leave to appeal to the Supreme Court ex mero motu or at the instance of any aggrieved party to such matter or proceedings:
Provided that the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, grant special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court from any final or interlocutory order, judgment , decree or sentence made by such High Court , in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction vested in it by paragraph (3) (b) of the Article 154P of the Constitution or section 3 of this Act, or any other law where such High Court has refused to grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court , or where in the opinion of the Supreme Court, the case or matter is fit for review by the Supreme Court: Provided further that the Supreme Court shall grant leave to appeal in every matter or proceeding in which it is satisfied that the question to be decided is of public or general importance; 
Counsel for the Petitioner has admitted that the application of the Petitioner is one preferred under s.9 (a) referred to above on the basis that the said section provides for such an application where in the opinion of the Supreme Court the case or matter is fit for review by the Supreme Court.
The said submission of the petitioner fails to take into account the provisions of the Maintenance Act No.37 of 1999 which is a later Act than the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provinces) Act No.19 of 1990. The said Maintenance Act has a special provision relating to appeals to the High Court and Appeals to the Supreme Court in s.14(2) as stated above. The application for maintenance by the Respondent was under the provisions of the Maintenance Act as was the appeal to the High Court from the decision of the Magistrates Court. In such a situation an application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court from the decision of the High Court should also be in terms of the provisions of the said Maintenance Act. According to s.14(2) as submitted by Counsel for the Respondent there is a difference in the procedure for invoking the appellate powers of the Supreme Court in a matter relating to maintenance. Unlike in any other case where an application for leave to appeal can be made directly to the Supreme Court against the judgment or Order of the High Court, no such direct 6 application can be made to the Supreme Court in respect of an application for maintenance against the Judgment of the High Court. Such an application should be preceded in a maintenance matter by first having recourse to the High Court itself in seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court and could apply to the Supreme Court only on a refusal of such application. In the present case no such application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court had been made by the Petitioner to the High Court of Chilaw.
A comparison of the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act No.43 of 1950 as amended by Act No.11 of 2003 relating to appeals to the Supreme Court from the High Court would also show that there is a difference in the procedure relating to appeals from High Courts in relation to maintenance matters as stated above. S.31DD(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act as amended states:
Any workman, trade union or employer who is aggrieved by any final order of a High Court established under Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction vested in it by law or in the exercise in its revisionary jurisdiction vested in it by law in relation to an order of a Labour tribunal, may appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court with the leave of the High Court or the Supreme Court first had and obtained. (emphasis added)
According to this section an aggrieved party has the option in invoking the appellate powers of the Supreme Court by either (a) making an application for special leave to the Supreme Court by making the application to the High Court itself or (b) making an application for special leave to appeal directly to the Supreme Court. Thus it would be seen that the option is made available by the use of the disjunctive word or whereas in the Maintenance Act there is no such option as the operative word used is the conjunctive word and.
The maxim generalia specialibus non derogant when applied to the present instance would also show that the general provision for appeals from High Courts to the Supreme Court as provided for by s.9 of the High Court of Provinces (Special 7 Provisions) Act No.19 of 1990 has no application where a special provision is made in a specific statute such as the provision in s.14(2) of the Maintenance Act No.37 of 1999 which was also enacted after the introduction of the general provision in Act No.19 of 1990.
S.14(2) of the Maintenance Act in fact sets out a condition precedent to the invocation of the Appellate powers of the Supreme Court from the judgment of a High Court in that an application for special leave to the Supreme Court should be made to the High Court in the first instance and only on the refusal of such an application can an application for special leave be made to the Supreme Court
Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes 12th Edition pg.328 referring to conditions precedent to jurisdiction states that
 Where an act or thing required by statute is a condition precedent to the jurisdiction of a tribunal, compliance cannot be dispensed with and, if it be impossible, the jurisdiction fails. It would not be competent to a court to dispense with what the legislature has made the indispensible foundation of its jurisdiction.
The submission made by Counsel for the Petitioner that the Supreme Court Rules by providing for Appeals from the High Court of Provinces allows direct appeals to be made to the Supreme Court is devoid of any merit as the Rules provide the procedure to be followed in invoking the appellate powers of the Supreme Court and does not provide substantive law relating to Appeals specially when there are specific provisions in statutes granting rights to appeal to the Supreme Court.
In the above circumstances the preliminary objection raised by the Respondent that the present application of the Petitioner for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court cannot be maintained is upheld and the application of the Petitioner is dismissed without costs.

Love and Terror in Pasternaks Russia
On October 6, 1949, a group of armed men stormed a small apartment in Moscow. The men belonged to the MGB, later to be called the KGB; they were Stalins state security men. The apartment, located on Potapov Street in Moscow, belonged to a woman named Olga Ivinskaya, who lived with her two children, mother, and step-father. They were not the reason that the MGB were at her door.
Ivinskaya was, at the time, the mistress of Boris Pasternak; even then one of Russias best-known poets, he was working on his epic masterpiece Dr. Zhivago. Ivinskaya and Pasternak had met at the offices of Novy Mir, where she worked as an editor. Despite their better effortshe was already once divorced and re-married; she was already twice widowedthe two fell in love. He was the countrys most beloved poet, and she, also a poet, albeit a new and struggling one, was in turn his beloved. When the MGB arrived, she was sitting at her typewriter, typing out a poem for Pasternak.
Ivinskaya would never finish it, but the man who inspired the poem was the reason that she was arrested and carted off to Lubyanka Prison.
The Russian secret police knew that Pasternak was in the midst of writing Dr. Zhivago, the story of a young Russian doctor who is at first infatuated with the Revolution only to become disenchanted and devastated both with and by it. In Ivinskaya, Pasternak had found a champion for the novel; with her support, he had begun giving readings of portions of it at literary salons in Moscow. In carting away his muse, the means of his emotional support, the MGB calculated, the progress of this incendiary and anti-Russian novel could be arrested. And so they did just that. The charges against Ivinskaya were expressing anti-Soviet opinions of a terrorist nature.
The use of the terrorist label to shut down free speech has some particular resonance in the contemporary United States. The Trump Administration signaled its eagerness to lock itself in a fitful embrace with Russia, and the reluctance of the usually abrasive President Trump to criticize Vladimir Putin has been duly noted and dissected. Authoritarian flavor has also featured prominently in the attempted Muslim ban, with which the Trump Administration has tried and failed to bar nationals from seven Muslim countries into the United States. The justification given for thisand the imminent designation of the Muslim Brotherhood, a pro-democracy Islamic political party prominent in the Middle Eastis terrorism.
The caustic taint of the label, its ruthless application of collective blame, and its insistent denial of due process, all seem aped from the Russian playbook of both then and now.
The anti-terror Russia of then did not spare Ivinskaya. On the night that she was carted off, her family, two children, relatives and neighbors were all detained in the living room of the apartment on Potapov Streeet as officers went through every scrap of paper for evidence.

Lufthansa to enhance bilateral ties with Jet Airways
European airliner group Lufthansa plans to enhance bilateral ties with Jet Airways BSE -1.66 % for increased connectivity to new cities and launch flight from Brussels to Mumbai next month.
Lufthansa Group, which operates 60 flights to and from India per week, has recently introduced the fuel-efficient A350-900 aircraft on Munich-Delhi route.
"We are also looking to intensify the bilateral relationship between Jet Airways and Lufthansa," Chairman of the Executive Board and CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG Carsten Spohr today said.
Already, Lufthansa and Jet Airways operate code share flights on certain routes and this collaboration is likely to be expanded further. Code share allows an airline to book its passengers for destination where it does not fly through a partner carrier.
Recently, the European major had expanded its partnership with Gulf carrier Etihad Airways -- which is a strategic partner of Jet Airways.
All the three carriers have significant presence in the European market.
"We have some code share going with Jet Airways. We would like to intensify and may be enlarge our portfolio of code share... That means flights to second tier cities which we are not operating directly could be destinations where we cooperate in terms of code share," Senior Director (South Asia) at Lufthansa Group Wolfgang Will said at a press meet.
He also noted code share has been a healthy component in their services.
Soon, Lufthansa would be introducing the A350-900 plane on Munich-Mumbai route apart from increasing the frequencies of its services between Pune and Frankfurt. "The services between Brussels and Mumbai would start by end of March," he noted. (The Economic Times)

Melania Trump prays, assails critics
US: US First Lady Melania Trump, usually a demure and soft-spoken presence at her husbands side, broke with form Saturday, reciting the Lords Prayer before issuing a scathing rebuke of his enemies and her critics at a campaign-style stop in Florida.
Preceding her husband on the dais at a rally in the city of Melbourne, the first lady started her remarks with the words let us pray, before beginning her recitation of the well-known Christian prayer.
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven, Mrs Trump read from the lectern, wrapping up the roughly half-minute-long prayer with an Amen. She then launched into an uncharacteristically strident defense of her husband -- and her own brief tenure as First Lady.
The America we envision is one that works for all Americans and where all Americans can work and succeed, she said.
A nation committed to a greater civility and unity between people from all sides of the political divide. I will always stay true to myself and be truthful to you, no matter what the opposition is saying about me, said the First Lady, wearing a red frock with a fitted waist and flared skirt, her mane of blonde hair blowing slightly in the breeze. I will act in the best interests of all of you. Im committed to creating and supporting initiatives dear to my heart. Which will have impact on women, and children all around the world, she said.
My husband is creating a country of great safety, and prosperity, the first lady said before introducing President Donald Trump, ceding the podium to cheers and applause.
Melania Trump has been a rare presence with her husband since the inauguration.
To the dismay of some critics, she has decided to continue living at their palatial residence in Trump Tower in New York until their 10-year-old son Barron finishes the school year.
Purists and traditionalists have been disappointed that the first lady has not kept with precedent and immediately joined her husband in the White House residence.
The poised, impeccably dressed Melania -- a former model from Slovenia -- is 24 years younger than her 70-year-old billionaire husband. She is Trumps third wife.
Her modeling career brought her in the mid-1990s to the United States, where she met the real estate mogul and reality television star she would eventually marry.
President Donald Trump hits the campaign stump for a rally in Melbourne, a city on Floridas famed Space Coast, seeking to reconnect with his tribe of largely white, male middle-class voters.
He delivered a speech lasting about 45 minutes in what was billed by the White House as a campaign rally for America. After pressure from US lawmakers, Melania Trump announced this week that the White House will finally reopen to the public in early March, nearly seven weeks after her husband Donald became president. White House tours are highly popular with visitors to Washington, a perk arranged by members of Congress for their constituents and foreign embassies for their nationals.
Some members of Congress had begun complaining about the long delay in restarting tours that had been suspended since Trumps inauguration January 20, and some critics have blamed the delays on Melania extended absence. However, criticism of the first lady has been mild compared to the blistering attacks lodged against her embattled husband, who is engaged in open warfare with the media and facing a major political contretemps over allegations of possible ties between his senior aides and officials in Russia. The controversy led to the resignation earlier this week of national security adviser Michael Flynn.

NITF gets reinsurance cover for agriculture
Sri Lankas National Insurance Trust Fund NITF says they have procured a reinsurance program for its agriculture insurance schemes.
This reinsurance programme will provide support to agricultural insurance schemes funded by NITF including the recently launched National Agricultural Loan Protection Scheme, NITF said in a statement.
The cover has been arranged on a stop loss basis which is typically the method adopted to obtain reinsurance for agricultural insurance.
Hannover Re (50%) and Swiss Re (40%), have together accepted a 90 percent share of the program, with three other global re-insurers sharing the balance 10 percent.
The placement was made through J.B. Boda & Co (S) Ltd., a leading reinsurance broker, selected after a competitive procurement process.
NITF is delighted to welcome Hannover Re and Swiss Re to its network of re-insurers which already includes the likes of Munich Re and Allianz SE, Manjula de Silva, chairman of NITF said.
NITF is rated AA  (lka) by Fitch Rating and is the fourth largest contributor to the government treasury among state owned enterprises. (LBO)

Nokia 3310 modern  version to be relaunched
With news of Nokia 3310 relaunch, Nokia fans are looking forward for a modern version of the indestructible mobile phone that has reserved a place for itself among everyones list of the most iconic tech gadgets..
There are many great reasons for the love the iconic Nokia 3310 gets even today. From the long battery life to unbreakable body, the handset is considered the most reliable phone you can get. And such was its fame that in 2014, 14 years after the original Nokia 3310 launch, the folks at Nokia pranked fans by announcing a modern retelling of the phone with Windows Phone 8 operating system, 41-megapixel camera etc.
But we dont really need too many features to continue our tryst with the Nokia 3310. Lets take a trip down memory lane and look at some of the reasons that make the Nokia 3310 the phone every user wants.
The smartphone era may have seen its fair share of innovations in terms of camera, UI, processing power, and features but unfortunately, battery life has taken the biggest hit as mobile communication evolved. The original Nokia 3310 offered a healthy 260 hours of standby time and a decent 4 hours and 30 minutes of talk time for a 1000mAh battery. With the new Nokia 3310, we can expect the era of improved battery life to return.
The Nokia 3310 is no doubt one of the most iconic Nokia phones ever built. Much like other Nokia feature phones that are known for their durability, reliability, and simplicity, the Nokia 3310 was also considered to be among the sturdiest handsets ever built. The Nokia 3310 could easily survive drops or even accidental water spills. The biggest relief was the handset never required a screen protector unlike modern day phones. With touchscreens dominating smartphones, there has been the fear of phones with cracked screens for users.(Gadgets)

A NOVEL way to be happy
I once knew a young man who had the habit of dropping in at our place every weekend, to see my mother because his aunt had once worked with my mother, because he liked to listen to my father's views on politics, discuss the stock market with my brother and play with our dog, the late Rambo D. On one visit he sauntered to the bookshelf in our living room, read the titles with deep interest, and upon being invited to choose any book he liked, to read and return, turned to me and asked which of the books would make him fall asleep faster
I was miffed by his question. It seemed incredible that anyone would want to use a book as a passport to enter the land of slumber. But last Friday, totally stressed out after a week of juggling my writing projects with my daughter's school and extra curricular events, lost library cards, an eight-hour power cut, a grumpy cat and a scorched garden and wanting to find a way to relax, when I searched Google for help I came across 8,880,000 articles that said he was right after all. "Reading is a great way to calm your mind and cue your body up for shut-eye" say the experts.
Beating stress
Provided, of course that the book is not a page-turner that will keep you up all night. (Try Brothers Karamazov and Ulysses for best effects). Using them as a nightcap apart, curling up with a good book anytime of the day, preferably with a hot cup of tea and a purr-bundle of fur on your lap could be one of the greatest ways to beat stress. And this works better and faster, so say the research reports, than other methods to calm frazzled nerves such as listening to music, going for a walk or settling down with a cup of coffee. Psychologists believe this is because the human mind has to concentrate on reading and the distraction of being taken into a literary world eases the tensions in muscles and the heart. According to cognitive neuropsychiatric Dr David Lewis, a study carried out on a group of volunteers by the University of Sussex revealed reading worked as the best method for relaxing, reducing stress levels by 68 per cent. "It really doesn't matter what book you read, by losing yourself in a thoroughly engrossing book you can escape from the worries and stresses of the everyday world and spend a while exploring the domain of the author's imagination," says Dr. Lewis and further adds, "This is more than merely a distraction but an active engaging of the imagination as the words on the printed page stimulate your creativity and cause you to enter what is essentially an altered state of consciousness."
Unlimited happiness
So, there is nothing like the fragrance of a printed book (specially because, you will never run low on battery)when it is perfectly clear that diving into a sea of white paper can offer us unlimited happiness.
As Dr. Seuss once wrote, "The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go." Splashing into a good book opens up a whole world of knowledge starting from a very young age. Children's books expose kids to 50 percent more words than prime time TV, according to a paper from the University of California, Berkeley. Exposure to that new vocabulary not only leads to higher scores on reading tests, but also higher scores on general tests of intelligence. Plus, stronger early reading skills may mean higher intelligence later in life.
(A quick tip: If you're looking for a power read, opt for a traditional book. Research suggests that reading on a screen can slow you down by as much as 20 to 30 percent.)
Plus, not only does regular reading help make you smarter, but it can actually increase your brain power. Just like going for jogging to exercise your cardiovascular system, reading regularly improves memory function by giving your brain a good work out. According to research published in 'Neurology', with age comes a decline in memory and brain function, but regular reading may help slow the process, keeping minds sharper longer. Frequent brain exercise can lower mental decline by 32 percent, reports The Huffington Post.
Other people's emotions
Reading can also make you more empathetic. Getting lost in a good read can make it easier for you to relate to others. This could be why George Eliot, who is rumored to have overcome her grief at losing her life partner through a program of guided reading with a young man who went on to become her husband, believed that "art is the nearest thing to life; it is a mode of amplifying experience and extending our contact with our fellow-men beyond the bounds of our personal lot." Literary fiction, specifically, has the power to help its readers understand what others are thinking by reading other people's emotions, says a research report published in the Science magazine.
The impact is much more significant on those who read literary fiction as opposed to those who read nonfiction."Understanding others' mental states is a crucial skill that enables the complex social relationships that characterize human societies," David Comer Kidd and Emanuele Castano explain in their article on the subject.
This could mean that reading may help fight Alzheimer's disease. After all, reading puts your brain to work, and that's a very good thing. Those who engage their brains through activities such as reading, chess, or puzzles could be 2.5 times less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease than those who spend their down time on less stimulating activities. Experts suggest that exercising the brain through reading may help a lot as inactivity increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's.
These facts are only a few that I found on the tip of one huge iceberg made up of studies conducted on the health and psychological benefits of reading books. If you spend the time going through the long lists of research reports on Google, you might just walk away thinking that reading is some sort of super activity, a wonder drug that makes us smarter and healthier. And guess what You are right.
A final warning before I go: reading enables lifelong learning and an insatiable thirst for knowledge. Books are a window to the world -- a glimpse into to cultures past, present, and future, as interpreted by their authors and filtered through our own imaginations. You can discover an amazing amount of information about where we have been, where we are going, and how things work. The more you know, the more you will be able to share. You will be a better conversationalist, a quicker thinker, a better problem solver. In any sort of creative field, these are skills that come in pretty handy.
Plain fun
In his 1905 essay "On Reading," Marcel Proust puts it nicely: "With books there is no forced sociability. If we pass the evening with those friends-books-it's because we really want to. When we leave them, we do so with regret and, when we have left them, there are none of those thoughts that spoil friendship: 'What did they think of us'-'Did we make a mistake and say something tactless'-'Did they like us'-nor is there the anxiety of being forgotten because of displacement by someone else."
Try it out. It's plain fun. 30 minutes a day, turn off everything but your brain and see how much better you feel.
As for those of you who are wondering what became of the young man in our living room, he is currently reading Herman Wouk's 'Inside, Outside' and, would you believe it, dear reader, I married him.
Here's why you should go read a book right now
1. Stress Reduction
No matter how much stress you have at work, in your personal relationships, or countless other issues faced in daily life, it all just slips away when you lose yourself in a great story.
2. Knowledge
Everything you read fills your head with new bits of information, and you never know when it might come in handy. The more knowledge you have, the better-equipped you are to tackle any challenge you'll ever face.
3. Stronger Analytical Thinking Skills
Have you ever read an amazing mystery novel, and solved the mystery yourself before finishing the book If so, you were able to put critical and analytical thinking to work by taking note of all the details provided and sorting them out to determine "whodunnit".
4. Better Writing Skills
This goes hand-in-hand with the expansion of your vocabulary: exposure to published, well-written work has a noted effect on one's own writing, as observing the cadence, fluidity, and writing styles of other authors will invariably influence your own work.
5. Tranquility
In addition to the relaxation that accompanies reading a good book, it's possible that the subject you read about can bring about immense inner peace and tranquility.
6. Free Entertainment
There's a reading genre for every literate person on the planet, and whether your tastes lie in classical literature, poetry, fashion magazines, biographies, religious texts, young adult books, self-help guides, street lit, or romance novels, there's something out there to capture your curiosity and imagination. Step away from your computer for a little while, crack open a book, and replenish your soul for a little while.

Over 5,000 pilgrims register for Katchatheevu church festival
A record 5,015 pilgrims, including about 2,000 from Rameswaram island have registered for the two-day annual St Antonys Church festival in Katchatheevu, scheduled for March 11 and 12, Rev Fr. Sagayaraj, Verkodu Parish Priest and chief coordinator of Indian pilgrimage said.
The response was overwhelming as the pilgrims wanted to visit and offer worship at the new church, which was inaugurated on December 23, 2016.
Last year, the festival was held on February 20 and 21, and 3,249 pilgrims, including 694 women and 154 children, participated in it.
This year, at least 4,500 were expected to participate, he said.
He said 147 mechanised boats, including two spare boats, had been registered for the pilgrimage and each boat could carry 30 pilgrims and five crew members.
Security reasons
On the demand for allowing country boats to take part in the pilgrimage, he said Sri Lankan Navy and Indian authorities were against carrying pilgrims in country boats for security reasons.
The district administration was likely to convene a meeting next week, with representatives of various security agencies to work out the modalities for the pilgrimage, he said.
For the first time, Sivaganga Diocese Bishop Rev Soosai Manickam would be joining the pilgrimage following an invitation from the Bishop of Jaffna Diocese, which organised the festival, he added.
The pilgrims would leave on March 11 morning from Rameswaram fishing jetty and take part in the Way of the Cross procession, jointly taken out by Indian and Sri Lankan pilgrims, followed by the mass, the same day evening.
After the feast mass on March 12, the pilgrims would return, he also added.
The Rameswaram fishermen had offered to donate a flag mast and monstrance at a total cost of Rs. 2.40 lakh to the new church for the annual festival and were awaiting response from the Jaffna Diocese, he said.

President's take on public servants
President Maithripala Sirisena addressing public servants in the Southern Province at a function in Weligama on Friday while praising the contribution of our public servants towards the country's progress nevertheless said that there were elements in the public service who were hellbent on sabotaging the government's programmes. The President's lament is not uncommon for all leaders. Following the change in government in 1994 after a 17 year long UNP vigil President Chandrika Kumaratunga railed at some of the leading figures in the public service, describing them as UNP stooges. Similarly after the decade long rule of Mahinda Rajapaksa we now see the same allegations being made, at least against a small coterie of public servants who in the eyes of regime was working to a hidden agenda at the instance of their former political masters.
Other than the President, there was Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake who is virtually having a running battle with the Auditor General, although it must be said here that the present holder of that high office does not deserve the brickbats hurled against him. Karunanayake has also taken issue with certain high officials of the Central Bank, who according to the Minister, was not implementing government fiscal policy or was slow in doing so. These officials, it was said, were those close to the former Central Bank governor and was doing his bidding. There was also Minister Kabir Hashim who is on record stating that his instructions were not being carried out by the Chairman of the National Carrier though in this instance the appointment was made by the Yahapalanaya government.
Change in governments often bring about such allegations, sometimes though not without reason. Although, there are some who are adept at shifting allegiances or as the Sinhala saying goes tie eka maru karanawa there are others who find it difficult to shed loyalties and engage in sabotage. The recent power blackouts in the country was also attributed to such elements necessitating the deployment of the military at vital power generation plants. Not all leaders though considered political party colours when handing out important appointments. The case of Bradman Weerakoon who functioned as Secretary to two Prime Ministers of the UNP and SLFP is a good example. This, though, is an exception rather than the rule with important functionaries getting marching orders with a regime change. It must said though that certain public servants carry out their duties with a conscience whichever party comes to power and irrespective of which political party they owed their appointments.
Be that as it may, public servants are the fulcrum of the revolving wheel that ensures a smooth administration and executing government's programmes. Any defect in the fulcrum would cause a malfunctioning of the wheel leading to chaos and disorder. Hence it is incumbent on all public servants to pull in a single direction and execute their duties with a sense of patriotism. While they are well within their rights to follow whatever school of politics or ideology, this should not detract them from the main duty towards the country. In short when they leave for their work places they should leave their politics at home and function with a single purpose of mind to implement the policies and porgrammes of the government of the day.
President Sirisena may have had reasons to believe that at least some of our public servants are working to a political agenda when he expressed his sentiments. If that is the case, those indulging in politics at the expense of their duty towards the country should be identified and hounded out. The country cannot afford to tolerate saboteurs if it is to realise its development goals and ensure a smooth administration. The public service as a whole needs a shake up, with shirkers identified and dealt with.
Dilan's dream
Deputy Minister Dilan Perera who is yearning for a Sirisena-Rajapaksa political marriage these days, after ditching the UNP, says that the SLFP part of the government is on course to join hands with the Joint Opposition to contest all future elections. It is not clear if Perera is reflecting the thinking of President Maithripala Sirisena or if he is expressing his own views. In his enthusiasm, though, to merge with the JO, the Deputy Minister has obviously overlooked certain salient facts.
By ditching the UNP to contest a future general election, the SLFP will have to select its own Prime Ministerial candidate and it is difficult to comprehend the JO opting for any other choice other than Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Minister Faiszer Musthapha, the other day, stated in no uncertain terms that President Sirisena would continue in office for a full six year term by virtue of the 19th amendment only coming into being after President Sirisena had already been elected and that the general election will necessarily have to precede the next Presidential election.
It will therefore be President Sirisena, who will have THE say in who will be the Prime Ministerial candidate.

Questions and answers
Obtaining a passport without Birth Certificate
Question:
My sister, 54, wishes to obtain a passport to go abroad on a pilgrimage. Yet, she doesnt have a Birth Certificate although she has a valid National Identity Card. She tried to obtain the Birth Certificate by producing the date which appears in her NIC with other information. But she was informed by authorities that they couldnt trace it after searching their records. What is the procedure to obtain a passport without a Birth Certificate
M.A.H.M. Waffar
Answer
If your sister has the NIC, it means that she has a Birth Certificate as well. But we have a doubt as to how she prepared a valid NIC without the Birth Certificate. However, if there is no Birth Certificate, you can prepare a Birth Certificate by producing the below documents to the Additional District Registrar where your sister was born.
* Marriage certificate of parents if they are married
* Nil result sheets
* One of the following documents indicating the date and place of birth
o Hospital report or certified copy
o Grama Niladhari report or certified copy
o Estate birth report or certified copy
o Copy of the midwifes birth registerIn case of non-possession of any of the above documents, you may produce
o Health development record
o Certificate of baptism
o Certified copy of the school admission register / pupils record sheet
o Estate welfare officers report
o Horoscope of the record of time prepared on a proximate date to the day on which the birth occurred
If she is unable to produce these documents, she can apply for a proposed age certificate consulting a judicial medical officer.
However, the Birth Certificate is necessary to prepare a Passport.

Rajapaksas and their cohorts thrown to political dustbin by people: Ranil
The Rajapaksas and their cohorts were thrown to the political dustbin by the people of this country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
If they try to ruin the future of the youth generation by obstructing development work and the countrys forward march, we will join hands with the youth and seal the lid of that bin to prevent them from making and political comeback, he said.
He was addressing a meeting after launching the Hemmathagama water supply project on February 18.
The project costing Rs. 15,352,30 million funded by the Netherlands, will provide drinking water to people in Hemmathagama, Mavanella, Aranayake, and Rambukkana and 62 surrounding hamlets. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the 2015 January 8 victory which ousted the Rajapaksa regime had now helped to bring water supplies to Hemmathagama and its environs.
The new water supply project was possible because of the assistance given by the king of Netherlands.
W|e should express our gratitude and thanks to the government of Netherlands, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said he was surprised when he understood that Minister Kabir Hashim had allocated such massive funding to develop the Mawanella area including Aranayake and Rambukkana. He had done that to ensure a better future for the people in the area.
The Prime Minister said the government as soon as it assumed power increased salaries of the public sector by Rs. 10,000 and the private sector by Rs. 2,500. Pensioners were given a Rs. 1,000 increment, which was beyond the capacity of the previous regime, The Prime Minister said the government also decreased the price of gas cylinder, milk powder by Rs. 61 per packet whereas flour prices were decreased by Rs. 12,50 and sugar by Rs. 10 per kilo. Price of sprats, salmon, Maldive fish, chili were also reduced and petrol diesel and kerosene oil were decreased.
Now the government has to cope up with a drought, reduction in rice output and several other problems, but it would not allow the cost of living to increase on account of these problems because peoples welfare was its prime concern. Now rice inputs have been allowed by removing all Customs duties and other taxes to tide over the shortage of local rice. Moreover additional paddy stocks in government warehouses had been released to millers to enable them release additional stocks to the market.
The Prime Minister said the government had now initiated a programme to generate employment opportunities to youth. This would benefit the youth and provide for their future welfare. New industries would be soon opened and Tourism would also be further developed.
The Prime Minister said the debt burden on the Hambantota port left behind by the Rajapaksa regime was reduced by the government by signing a contract with the China Merchant Company to develop the Hambantota area under which China would write off 1,100 million us dollars out of the 1,300 millions dollars leaving us with only 200 million dollars as against one share of the Hambantota Industrial zone project.
Now the Chinese company has suggested to build an oil refinery, a shipyard, cement factory and an LNG power station. Apart from these, it would be possible to launch about 200 to 300 factories in Hambantota and providing employments to the youth.
Parliamentarian Vasudewa Nanayakkara had gone to courts to get the Hambantota framework agreement annulled. If he succeededs in this move, the onus of repaying the 1, 00 million dollars of the Chinese loan would devolve on the people making each indebted by Rs. 12,000 annually. Nanayakkara, who represented the Eheliyagoda seat had done this to prevent the youth from getting jobs. The Prime Minister said work on the Hambantoa Industrial zone would be launched before the end of next month.
Ministers Rauff Hakeem and Kabir Hashim and Deputy Ministers Ranjan Ramanayake and Nalin Bandara spoke.

Return to the good old neighbourhood
I believe that old fashioned neighbourhood courtesy is becoming a thing of the past. Knowing one's community is very important in any society. During my childhood I lived with my parents in a pretty decent Colombo neighbourhood.
It was a totally different world, with different values and pace of life. The downside was that everybody knew all your business! The parapet walls separating our four different immediate neighbours were only four feet high. You could lean over the wall, see and speak easily to your neighbours. Today all those walls are about seven feet high or more, deliberately screening you off from your neighbours.
Good neighbours
The street where we lived had a real community spirit. We knew all our neighbours and had several social get-togethers, parties, dinners and lunches. We went out together, helped one another and kept an eye out for one another. This was Colombo from the late 50s to the late 70s.
The children of some of our neighbours wandered in and out of our house as if they owned the place. And no one minded. The doors were always unlocked and they knew they were welcome. Mercifully we had good neighbours all round of different communities.
There were probably a dozen families down our street who often gravitated into one-another's gardens on fine evenings for drinks and snacks. And they would always be there in an emergency or when you needed them most. I realise now how fortunate we were then to have such kindred spirits in close proximity. We all knew each other by name and nicknames as well. There was a real solidarity in case of need and nobody cared what your station in life was as long as you respected the others. Our neighbours were our surrogate family. On numerous occasions we all extended help and support, even when unasked. Everyone knew their children were safe when playing in a neighbour's garden, because people cared and looked out for one another. We would not have wanted to live anywhere else.
For a good relationship with neighbours, mutual goodwill is required, but unfortunately this cannot happen in some cases due to a variety of reasons. But still, one who shows better hospitality and compassion than his neighbour does, regardless of his neighbour's courtesy or indifference, already gains, by becoming a happier person!
Unpleasant consequences
Sometimes it is not easy to overlook certain individual frailties. At other times we fail to appreciate how our actions might affect the lives of those around us. Failing to consider how our neighbours might feel about our outdoor late night party with loud music, smoky bonfires or dogs barking can often be the start of deterioration in relationships that can have unpleasant consequences for both.
Needlessly falling out with our neighbours deprives us of many advantages and exposes us to worry and unnecessary stress. All it takes is to show some common sense and courtesy by respecting your neighbour's circumstances and behave towards them as you would expect them to behave towards you.
For too many people these days a neighbour is merely someone who has just run out of something, be it sugar or patience. Gone are the days when neighbours leaned up against each other's walls or fences and chatted about the cricket while the wives exchanged sumptuous goodies.
But often you might have to put up with minor irritations such as when certain people covet thy neighbour's lawn mower, floor polisher, step ladder or electric drill. Only the other day my neighbour returned my borrowed drill with several original drill bits broken. These days, some neighbours think that buying an appliance you use only a few times a year feels like a sin.
Whatever you may say about the guy he is a practical thick-skinned individual with a hide akin to a rhino's. And make no mistake about it he is also resourceful. Look at it this way. Household drills are used for only a few minutes a year at most. Worse, you never actually need a drill. What you actually need is a hole. The drill is just the tool that provides it. So why buy it when you could borrow one from your neighbour
There is no sure- fire way to deal with the huge variety of neighbour problems that people are faced with. But a good way to start is by being friendly with the people next door and then the ones next door to them.
Neighbour etiquette
What is neighbour etiquette It is not our business how others live if they leave us to live our lives in peace. It is our right to enjoy peace and quiet in our homes.
That right supersedes the right of our neighbour to create a noise or disturbance that intrudes into our dwelling.
If neighbours do not leave us in peace, their interference and intrusion into our lives and senses can have very detrimental effects on our well being and health. This exemplifies the need to have a code of good neighbourhood manners and etiquette.
Be courteous and helpful without being meddlesome. Later in life when I moved into suburbia I had a nosey parker of a neighbour who made it a point to drop in every time he observed we were entertaining. He became such a pest in our lives intruding into our privacy that we had to politely tell him that we were holding a family get-together. So then what about all the other neighbours-from-hell stories or that old adage about choosing friends but enduring neighbours Neighbours are a fact of life, but you can make your own life easier by keeping your neighbours sweet and talking to them over the fence instead of through lawyers.
For many people reality is not being friends with your neighbours, but reality does not have to mean being unfriendly with your neighbours. There are some basic guidelines of etiquette also known as common sense that if followed, should result in a mutually appreciated relationship with your neighbours. Being on bad terms with your neighbour can make your life frustrating, day after day. But taking the time to establish good terms with your neighbours has numerous benefits. The community will be friendlier, the neighbourhood safer, and the area a nicer and more comfortable place to live in.

The runaway bride
A grand wedding reception held at a leading hotel in Aluthgama had a sad ending for the bridegroom, parents of both parties and the invitees when the bride suddenly went missing after the nuptials and other traditional ceremonies, recently.
The parents of the bride had found a suitable partner for their daughter and planned to give her away in right royal style by arranging a grand reception at a leading hotel in Aluthgama.
They had spent over Rs. 1.7 million for the tamasha. The reception had got into full swing after the traditional marraige ceremonies with liquor flowing freely.
Almost all elders present were in high spirits and the couple was enjoying the frolicking seated on their sofa in the hall. Suddenly, the relatives had come to understand that the bride had gone missing and searched every nook and corner in the hotel to find her.
All were astounded and the agitated relatives and friends were informed that someone had seen the bride standing at the entrance and getting into a car which had stopped in front and leaving with the person who drove the car. Later to the consternation of all, it was revealed that she had eloped with a married man of the same area whom she had befriended earlier.

Savour the season!
Ceylon Olive locally known as Veralu is a species indigenous to Sri Lanka. Veralu grows on medium sized trees that are naturally grown in home gardens across the country. The green oval shaped unripe fruit is boiled and seasoned with salt and chili powder and sold as pickles known as Veralu Achcharu which is a popular street food in Sri Lanka. The ripe fruit can be eaten with sugar or jaggery. In addition to its addictive taste it also has important medical benefits. Garden Talk speaks to Director of Institute of Indigenous Medicine, Swarna Hapuarachchi to discover the many benefits of Veralu.
"Veralu is a tropical plant. You can see it in the Indian Sub-Continent, Indo China and South East Asia. It is a medium-sized tree. The leaves of the tree have medicinal value while the fruit also has various health benefits," said Hapuaracchchi.
Veralu which has the botanical name of Elaeocarpus Serratus comes from the Elaeocarpaceae family. "Veralu fruit is smooth, green and oval shaped and is very similar to the Olive externally. The tree is very attractive with red and yellow leaves among the green. It has an astringent quality and after ripening it is sweet and acidic. Actually it has a very peculiar taste," stated Hapuarachchi.
Preparation
Veralu can be prepared in many ways. It can be prepared as Veralu Achcharu or as a curry or it can be eaten as a fruit.
"Boil unripe or slightly ripe Veralu in salted water, then drain it and place it in a bowl. Add pepper, Chili flakes, some sugar and a little Vinegar and mix it thoroughly. The result is a delicious dish! You have a super Achcharu!" she says about pickles made of the fruit.
Director of Institute of Indigenous Medicine, Swarna Hapuarachchi
"To make a curry, first boil olives in salted water after removing seeds. Then heat oil in a pan and add mustard seeds. After frying it, add ginger, garlic, onion and fry it for golden brown color. Next add cardamom, cinnamon, curry leaves and mix well.
Then add tomato curry powder, chili powder, pepper powder, turmeric powder and fry for about 1 minute on low fire. Then add coconut milk and olives and mix well and cook for 5 minutes on low fire and add salt to taste," she added.
Veralu juice
"You can also make Veralu juice. You can remove the pericarp and blend with water and add salt and sugar, just like preparing fruit juice," explained Hapuarachchi.
There are nearly 34 varieties of Veralu that grows in different countries.
"Veralu can be grown all over Sri Lanka. Mostly it is propagated by seedlings. It can be grown in any home garden. Its flowers are whitish and fragrant and attract bees and birds," added Hapuarachchi.
"It is good for the hair. Currently, Sri Lankan ayurveda herbal shampoo and conditioners made out of Veralu are sold in the local and international markets. Paste from the Veralu leaf can be used for hair conditioning. Leaves are boiled with the Fenugreek seeds.
Then you grind it and mix with lime juice to prepare a paste," Hapuarachchi noted finally.
MEDICINAL BENEFITS
It is good for Diarrhea. It has some constipation property. When you eat too much of Veralu, the astringent property in it can cause constipation.
The leaves have anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.
Leaves are also good for diabetes and arthritis. You can consume the leaves as a juice.
The paste made of leaves can be used for cleansing wounds and as a conditioner for the hair.

To mark the imminent launch of our 2016 Seeds giveaway, where we give away a packet of seeds with every paper, we've pulled together the seven things you need to know to set up your own vegetable garden so you too can join the produce revolution.
Site:
Before you do anything, you first need a location for the vegetable garden. Will you plan it straight into the ground, into raised beds or vertically on the wall Be aware most vegetables are thirsty for sunlight so find a sunny place with good drainage.
Selection:
Next up is to decide what you're going to plant. Choose vegetables that suit your climate and ones that are likely to survive in the area you have chosen.
If you are growing climbing plants like beans or tomatoes you will need to stake them, and things like cucumbers and zucchinis like to drape, so plant them near the edges if you are using a raised garden bed.
Sun:
Most vegetables like about six hours of sunlight a day, but there are some which can thrive in part-shaded places. A good rule of thumb is if you plant for the fruit or the root, it needs full sun. If you plant for the leaves or stems, a little shade will be fine.
Soil:
Most vegetables do best in a moist, well-drained soil that is rich in organic matter. If your backyard soil is poor, you may be able to bring it back to life with some organic matter and aeration.
Water:
Different vegetables like different amounts of water, but normally you should water your vegetable garden a few times a week, or potentially daily when it gets really hot. Feel the top few inches of soil and if it's dry, it's time to water.
Space:
Read the back of your seed packet or tag to see how far apart you should plant your vegetables. Some don't mind being up close and personal with their biddies, but some want to hog the whole bed.
Pests and diseases:
White oil is a safe and effective way of controlling pests in your garden. You can find it at your local hardware store or nursery, but as with most pesticides and repellents it's best to test it on a small portion of your plants first to ensure they don't have an adverse reaction.
And now you're all set to set up your very own vegetable garden, and once you taste the freshness of your own backyard, you'll never go back to store bought again. -gladstoneobserve

Sharjeel, Latif charged for alleged corruption
Pakistan and Islamabad United batsmen Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif face the prospect of lengthy bans from cricket after the PCB charged them for alleged breaches of its anti-corruption code.
The pair were handed official charge sheets of their alleged misdemeanours on Saturday in Lahore, a week after they were sent home from the ongoing Pakistan Super League in the UAE.
The PCB confirmed in a statement that Sharjeel and Latif had been charged for breaching various articles under Clause 2, including specific ones to attempt to corrupt a game, as well as more general misdemeanours of failing to disclose suspect approaches.
They have been handed notices and been advised to seek legal counsel, the PCBs legal advisor Taffazul Rizvi said. They have 14 days to respond.
Sharjeel and Latif have been in Lahore for the last three days, where they have been interviewed extensively by the PCBs Vigilance and Security department.
They were handed their notices in person on Saturday.
The other key figure in the investigation is another left-handed opener who has represented Pakistan - Nasir Jamshed, who was arrested in the UK by the National Crime Agency last Monday but released on bail until April.

South Koreas Jang wins Australian Open
ADELAIDE: South Koreas Jang Ha-Na stormed to a three-shot victory in the Australian Open at Royal Adelaide with a blistering eagle-birdie finish on Sunday.
The world number six claimed her fourth LPGA tournament win with a sensational flourish to her final round.
Jang, 24, conjured a remarkable finish with an eagle from long range at the 17th followed by a brilliant birdie at the 18th to reach 10-under 282.
Her round of four-under 69 equalled the lowest round of the day but it was done in the toughest of the conditions with gusty winds.
Jang defeated Denmarks Nanna Madsen on seven-under 285 with a group of four including Thailands world number two Ariya Jutanugarn at joint third on six-under 286.
The Korean star had a sizzling back nine of five-under 31 with birdies at the 13th, 14th and 18th holes as well as the eagle at 17.
Overnight leader American Lizette Salas, who led by three shots at the 11th hole on Sunday, fell away badly to record a five-over 78 and finish tied for seventh.
New Zealands world number one Lydia Ko never fired in the tournament and finished tied for 46th place on two-over after a closing round of two-over 75.
Ko completed just one round under par at Royal Adelaide in her first outing since changing coach, club-makers and caddie.
She focused on the positives.
I hit my driver really well and that was the biggest thing that I was struggling with towards the end of my year last year, she said.
It was great to be confident and be able to hit those fairways, especially with the wind this week, it wasnt easy to hit them.
A lot of positive signs. Hopefully by next week it will be polished. It was my first tournament back. -AFP

Sri Lanka A face uphill task chasing 365
England Lions set an imposing target and then took two early wickets on a rain-interrupted third day of the first unofficial Test with Sri Lanka A at the Pallekele Stadium yesterday.
Having recovered from 85 for 6 to post 215, Tom Curran removed Dimuth Karunaratne with the first ball of the fourth innings and Toby Roland-Jones had Sandun Weerakkody, Sri Lanka As top-scorer first time around, lbw for 16.
Tom Curran and his brother Sam had played a central role with the bat, too, having extended their seventh-wicket partnership to 62. Dilruwan Perera then struck three times to complete a five-wicket haul before rain caused a delay of more than four hours.
When the teams finally got back out, Ollie Rayner and Tom Helm held off the Sri Lanka A spinners to put on another valuable tenth-wicket stand. Helm was last out for 26, one run short of equalling his first-class best, as he and Middlesex team-mate Rayner added exactly 50 in 21.5 overs.
That left Sri Lanka A facing a stiff requirement of 365 to win and they were quickly in trouble at 19 for 2. Rayner could have struck with the ball in the fading light, too, but Udara Jayasundera and Roshen Silva both survived chances to slip.
The start of play was moved forward by 15 minutes to try and make up for time lost on the second day. The Lions already had a lead of 261 and the Currans set about extending it, both striking an early boundary.
Sam Curran had reached 36 when when he was pinned lbw by Dilruwan, who also had Tom Curran stumped, for 29, in his next over. Roland-Jones, having cracked a belligerent 82 in the first innings, was taken at slip for 7 but Sri Lanka A had to wait several hours to separate the final pair, Malinda Pushpakumara eventually taking the second new ball to claim his fourth wicket and match figures of 8 for 174.
Scores:
England Lions 316 and 215 in 80.5 overs (112/6 o/n) (K Jennings 37, S Currran 36, T Curran 29, O Raynor 32 n.o., T Helm 26, D Perera 5/73, M Pushpakumara 4/77)
Sri Lanka A 167 and 41-2 at close in 15 overs.

Sri Lanka wins first runner up award at Yale Chapter ISTF
Sri Lanka won the first runner up award for Best Innovative Prize for Environmental Projects in the tropics at the Yale Chapter of the International Society for Tropical Foresters (ISTF) held in New York recently.
Dr. Keerthi Mohotti, Deputy Director Research at the Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka in his capacity as Chairman of the National Steering Committee of GEF (Global Environmental Facility)/SGP (Small Grants Project) /UNDP representing Sri Lanka and the project executing body was present at Yale, New Haven, Connecticut, USA to show case the environmental project demonstrated by Sri Lanka and to receive the award.
Sri Lanka is honoured to received such an award from among 25 competitive submissions around the world evaluated by an expert US panel and showcasing a technically sound and innovative environmental project conducted by rural communities.
The 2017 ISTF conference was held from January 2728, 2017 under the theme Tropical Forests in a Connected World: Collaborative Solutions for a Sustainable Future. Sri Lanka and Cambodia became the top two finalists out of 25 projects rigorously evaluated by an expert US panel.
Sri Lankas submission was on the project Promotion of Bio Gas Technology and Efficient Rubber Drying Houses to Reduce Green House Gas Emissions Associated with the Rubber Industry in the Kegalle District funded by GEF / SGP/UNDP. The project was executed by Anura Premathilaka and the team of Human and Environment Development Organization (HEDO) on the advice of the National Steering Committee of GEF/SGP.
Having evaluated the environmentally sensitive issues in the rubber production areas, technical advice and guidance were provided where several innovative operations were included for practice by selected small holder rubber communities in the Nelundeniya, Galapitamada, Mampita and Lenagala Grama Niladhari Divisions of Warakapola Divisional Secretariat in the Kegalle District.
A few model demonstrations executed in this GEF funded environmental project covered components such as (1) Conversion of conventional smoke houses using large consumption of fire wood sources to efficient rubber drying houses using locally available saw dust, an industrial waste which would have otherwise been disposed along river banks or open burning resulting in environmental degradation in view of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the rubber production process and to minimise deforestation in the surroundings and (2) Conversion of rubber affluent from smoke houses to bio gas to reduce environment pollution through the acidic waste to water streams threatening the Bandula Barb (Puntius bandula) which is a critically endangered and point endemic species found in this area reported in the National Red list.

Thoughts on gardening
Earth laughs in flowers.
-Ralph Waldo Emerson
No ray of sunlight is ever lost, but the green it wakes into existence needs time to sprout, and it is not always granted to the sower to live to see the harvest.
All work that is worth anything is done in faith.
-Albert Schweitzer
The greatest fine art of the future will be the making of a comfortable living from a small piece of land.
-Abraham Lincoln
When the world wearies and society fails to satisfy, there is always the garden.
-Minnie Aumonier
The love of gardening is a seed once sown that never dies.
-Gertrude Jekyll
It didnt occur to me that that gardening, like music, could demand practice, patience, a willingness to make mistakes.
-Amy Stewart
The garden, historically, is the place where all the senses are exploited. Not just the eye, but the ear  with water, with birds. And there is texture, too, in plants you long to touch.
-William Howard Adams
Gardening simply does not allow one to be mentally old, because too many hopes and dreams are yet to be realized.
-Allan Armitage
Gardening is akin to writing stories. No experience could have taught me more about grief or flowers, about achieving survival by going, your fingers in the ground, the limit of physical exhaustion.

## Title: Is too much protein bad for you

Is too much protein bad for you
The market for protein supplements is now mainstream - but many of us already eat twice as much as protein as the World Health Organization recommends.
Carbohydrates are causing an obesity epidemic and fats silt up your arteries. But protein It provides the building blocks for essential stuff such as cells, muscles, bone, nails, hormones and enzymes.
The word protein comes from the Greek and means first, as in most important. We cant get enough of it. Bodybuilders take protein supplements in the form of milkshakes, energy drinks or bars to build up their muscle bulk. But even ordinary folk see protein as their new best dietary friend. The world market for protein supplements is now firmly mainstream and estimated to reach 8bn a year by 2017.
The solution
The UK governments dietary guidelines state that men need 55.5g and women 45g of protein a day. A chicken breast has at least 23.5g while a 100g steak has 20.9g. In western Europe and the US, people are already eating twice as much protein as recommended by the World Health Organisation.
The most recent US dietary guidelines warn that teenage boys and adult men should reduce overall intake of protein foods and eat more vegetables. Teenage girls, who often have disturbed eating patterns, and elderly people, who are prone to lose muscle mass as well as appetite, were the only groups identified as being protein-deficient. The New York Times has an ongoing debate about the risks and benefits of protein. Last week, its print edition carried an article with the headline Is protein a magic bullet, though the online version asked Can you get too much protein.
Alarm bells sounded after research published in the journal Cell Metabolism in 2014 (using data from more than 6,000 Americans) concluded that people aged between 50 and 65 who got 20% or more of their calories from protein were 74% more likely to die from cancer than those who ate less protein.
The study has been criticised for taking dietary records for only 24 hours. It also surprisingly found that a high-protein diet actually reduced the risk of dying early in those aged over 65. Its not clear why the results should be so different for the two age groups.
Inconclusive
The evidence on protein remains inconclusive. Some studies show that more protein - and fewer carbohydrates - reduces blood pressure and protects against heart disease.
What the evidence does suggest is that red or processed meat as a main source of protein is linked to an increase in colon cancer, while fish, chicken and plant sources of protein are healthier. You can only absorb 20g to 40g of protein in one sitting and I could find no robust evidence that guzzling it will increase muscle mass. So, unless you are old, poorly and not eating, you are probably getting enough protein and are unlikely to benefit from supplements -whatever they promise you.

Top WTO experts at DoCs  pioneering export barriers confab
Two leading experts from Geneva are now in Colombo for todays (20 February) pioneering session by Department of Commerce to work on one of the most technically demanding barriers for Lankan exporters, called by global trade as Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures-in simpler terms, quarantining and technical barriers.
Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen under whose direction work began on Sri Lankas SPS measures way back in September 2014 in Colombo with WTO (joined by with 16 leading Lankan export firms), expressed his satisfaction on the latest WTO Colombo session during his discussion with top officials on 16th February at the Ministry.
Such a highly technical process should not be an obstacle or barrier to the keen Lankan exporters but we should take advantage of it. The 20 February session could show us how to do this stressed Minister Bathiudeen.
The WTO experts from Geneva joining the 20 February session are its Trade and Environment Counsellor Erik Wijkstrom and its Economic Affairs Officer, Roshan Khan.
The agricultural exports of a country are the sector greatly impacted by SPS. Around 22% of Sri Lankas annual exports are agricultural, at US $ 2.5 Bn.
With increasing trade among WTO members, comes growing health concerns about goods crossing their borders.
The February 20 Colombo session is not targeted only at Lankan exporters but also aimed at Sri Lankan officials and other experts involved in SPS measures for export products.
The session is expected to assist participants towards a close scrutiny of the measures and how to adopt them.
Time to time the WTO Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures conveys to relevant Sri Lankan authority (Eg: Health Ministry) of any new product added to SPS schedule.
Among many such products added lately and notified to Sri Lanka are milk and milk products, salt, carbonated beverages (for sugar levels), food colouring and additives, GMOs (Soya, corn, fresh tomato, beet-sugar etc) and even labelling of food.

Toshiba chairman quits  over $3.4 bn loss
Toshiba chairman Shigenori Shiga has resigned, hours after the Japanese conglomerate revealed details of a multi-billion dollar loss.
Earlier Toshiba had delayed issuing its results, but it then said it was set to report a net loss of 390bn yen ($3.4bn) in the year to March 2017.
The company said it expected to take a 712.5 billion yen ($6.3bn, 5bn) writedown at its US nuclear business.
The situation has led some analysts to warn the companys future is at risk.
Shiga was stepping down to take management responsibility for the loss, the firm said.
Shares fell by as much as 9% on Tuesday and have lost about 50% since late December, when it first warned about the extent of the problems.
The losses are linked to a deal done by its US subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric, when it bought a nuclear construction and services business from Chicago Bridge & Iron in 2015.
Assets that it took on are likely to be worth less than initially thought and there is also a dispute about payments that are due.
It has already announced plans to sell off part of its profitable memory chip business to raise funds. It is the second largest chip maker in the world, behind Samsung.
The company is still struggling to recover after it emerged in 2015 that profits had been overstated for seven years, prompting the chief executive to resign.
Toshiba has a 60% stake in NuGen, a joint venture with Frances Engie, which has the contract to build a new nuclear power plant in Cumbria in the UK.
It is estimated that the Moorside plant will eventually provide as much as 7% of the UKs energy needs. BBC

Tsonga records 400th win, faces Goffin in Dutch final
ROTTERDAM, Saturday - Jo-Wilfried Tsonga rained down ten aces, finishing off Tomas Berdych 6-3, 6-4 in 72 minutes on Saturday to power into a second Rotterdam World Tennis final and record his 400th career win. The French sixth seed will compete for his first title at the Ahoy stadium after finishing runner-up six years ago.
He next faces Belgian third seed David Goffin, who defeated French qualifier Pierre-Hugues Herbert 6-1, 6-3 in 74 minutes, breaking four times.
Goffin will be playing his second final in as many weeks after losing to Grigor Dimitrov in the title match in Sofia.
The Belgian had already avenged that defeat by seeing off Dimitrov in the Rotterdam quarter-finals on Friday.
Goffin had not won a main draw match in Rotterdam before this breakthrough week and will reach a top 10 ranking for the first time after making the final. It was a good match, I played pretty solid on my serve, which is good for my game. When Im serving like this Im able to create a bit more on the return and be a bit more offensive, Tsonga said.
Tsonga was unstoppable against Berdych, the 2014 champion and 2015 finalist playing his fourth semi-final at the Dutch event.
He came good in his second semi-final of the season as he bids for a first trophy since winning at home in Metz in 2015.
Berdych came to the court with an 8-3 lead in the series, including wins in their last two meetings, one a Doha quarter-final last month. Tsonga finished with two breaks of the 13th-ranked Czech while never facing a break point in what quickly became one-way traffic.
My only goal is to win the next match, this would be important for me, 2011 runner-up Tsonga said. AFP

WHO gives blessings to SLs first Consumer Protection Lab
The rallying call for Sri Lankas much needed Consumer Product Test Lab received a sudden boost when the specialised agency for public health across the world threw its support behind the initiative on 16 February.
This will assure the speed and high quality of market product testing and lab reports of Sri Lankas CAA said a supportive World Health Organisation (WHO) Representative in Sri Lanka Dr. Jacob Kumaresan on 16 February in Colombo. WHOs Dr Kumaresan was discussing with Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen in Colombo about WHOs position on the proposal to establish a Product Testing & Safety Lab for Sri Lankas apex Consumer protection body, the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA).
Joining Minister Bathiudeen were Senior Advisor to Minister Bathiudeen Himali Jinadasa, Director of Hettigoda Industries (Pvt) LtdVidyani Hettigoda and CAA officials. The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) seek WHOs assistance to CAAs proposed Product Testing & Safety Lab.
This project, once constructed, shall be a milestone in our Consumer Protection history. Our proposal for the lab, if supported, can enhance Sri Lankas consumer protection greatly from where it is present, Minister Bathiudeen said.
CAA collects samples of food items and tests for quality parameters. CAAs experience is that monitoring mechanisms such as testing are not sufficient enough to eliminate the malpractices in the supply chain. The mechanism is also not able to cover the entire country.
It appears that Sri Lanka has multiple numbers of labs for product testing and this is not as supportive as it seems.
We suggest a single, centralised national level lab for all frequent testing of consume products. Such a centralised lab will assure the high quality of test reports, speed, stronger legal protection and better labelling, said WHOs Dr Kumaresan.
This is a promising project but not a responsibility of one Ministry but a joint effort. Funds could be sourced from international agencies such as the World Bank if CAA proposal can be jointly worked with the stakeholders of legal, health and food processing sectors.
In fact, the proposed CAA Lab is a good exercise in Consumer Protection in Sri Lanka since all the stakeholders.
The samples collected from the market by CAA are presently not sent to a single, centralised unit for reports but to multiple agenciesthe Government Analyst, City Analyst, Medical Research Institute (MRI), Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) and Sri Lanka Standards Institute (SLSI). This burdens CAA processes and results in unexpected delays, at times.

Writ petition filed by Perpetual Treasuries fixed for support

A writ petition filed by Perpetual Treasuries Private Limited, seeking an Interim Order restraining the Central Bank from taking action under the directives issued by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, was today (20) fixed for support on March 3 by the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal two-judge-bench comprising Justice (President) Vijith Malalgoda and Justice S. Thurairajah directed the petitioners to serve notice on Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy, the Monetary Board of Central Bank and two other respondents to appear before the Court on the said date.
The petition, filed by Perpetual Treasuries (Private) Limited - a primary dealer in government securities - Perpetual Asset Management (Private) Limited and Perpetual Capital Holdings (Private) Limited, through Counsel G.G. Arulpragasam seeks to quash the directives made by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank dated November 7, 2016 in respect of the Perpetual Treasuries.
The petitioners stated that the directions issued on November 7, 2016 is unprecedented regulatory control over a primary dealer by the Monetary Board, and is wholly disproportionate to violations and regulatory concerns cited in the petition.
The petitioners have said the directions are unlawful, unreasonable, unjustifiable, arbitrary and capricious and are in violation of legitimate expectations of Perpetual Treasuries and were imposed without a fair hearing.
The petitioners stated that the directions were issued beyond the scope of Regulation 11(2) of the Local Treasury Bills (Primary Dealers) Regulations No.01 of 2009 dated June 24, 2009 Regulations No.01 of 2009 dated June 24, 2009.
The petitioners also stated it is not possible to sustain operations without the risk of bankruptcy and all attempts to seek redress, clarification or relief have been largely ignored by the respondents and that the petitioner has no other recourse than to seek relief from Court.
The Monetary Board of Central Bank had issued directives against Perpetual Treasuries that was involved in controversial bond deals.

Yalpanam yum- yum
Aroma is the first hint. Then the music fills your ears. The traditional dance performance surfaces next. The guests enamoured by that kind of cultural extravaganza while savouring the aromatic cuisine will be tempting enough. Music, dance or food; which one is worth a first try Move heaven and earth, yet you will still be clueless. Lay that worry to rest and feast the night away for the Jaffna Festival is now in city.
Jaffna, more affectionately known as Yalpanam, has triggered many stories in Sri Lanka. Jaffna library, Yal Devi train and the list will go on. Hardly anyone would however talk about delicacies from this far off metropolis apparently because of a war that ran for decades.
Thanks to the efforts of a few culinary experts, the Colombo citizens now have an opportunity enjoy an amazing range of delicacies from Jaffna until February 26. The Jaffna festival was initiated in Cinnamon Grand on February 16 at the hotels village suite, Nugagama. Under the giant Banyan tree, Yalpanam cuisine has more to it than wolfing down a Dosai or an Idly in a run of the mill saivar kiosk. The ambience is full of Yalpanam aroma, and you will hardly feel the hours wear away as you fress the delicacies the whole night. And of course there are many more than a dosai or an idly on a platter full of enriching warmth.
The festival was inaugurated by Tourism Development Minister John Amaratunga while Tourism Development Authority Chairman Paddy Withana, John Keels Leisure Industry Group President Krishan Balendra and Cinnamon Grand General Manager Rohan Karr graced the occasion.
The event is a culmination of the intriguing food, art, music and entertainment which is part of the rich culture and heritage of Sri Lankas northern hemisphere, commonly known as Jaffna. The festival is open for dinner on weekdays and for both lunch and dinner on Saturdays and Sundays priced at Rs 2600. This will be a debut initiative to give metropolitans, diaspora and tourists a slice of Jaffna right here in the city of Colombo.
The Jaffna Festival became a reality thanks to five ladies to prepare more than 70 authentically Jaffna dishes using produce sourced daily from the farmers and markets of the district, artisans and spice manufacturers from Pungudutivu. The Jaffna food festival is one ideal occasion to have a different kind of dining experience with your family and friends.
For those who have heard that Hindus are either vegetarians or vegans, the surprise is in store with a separate table of sizzling pots of seafood soaked generously in spice. Smell it before tasting, and you will feel the tastebuds stirring within. And the almost countless desserts will take you to a Shangri-la.
Jaffnas rich food culture should be an offshoot of its tropical climate and occasional rainfall. The climate is an essential ingredient that infuses aroma into spice. The Sinhalese and Tamils share a similar tongue for spice. Although South Indian food and Jaffna food are similar, the Jaffna category bears much similarity to the Sri Lankan cuisine. The guests also have a chance to enjoy beer, which no doubt gets along with spicy food more than anything else.
Walking down to this little hamlet called Nugagama, along the five-star corridor of Cinnamon Grand, you will feel the difference. Food is the thing, of course, though not everything. The ambience and culture hold much interest with the stewards attired in traditional dresses. The music as well as dance are authentically imported from Jaffna. You are invited to delight in the cultural blend here. Go for the feel and the touch of the culture.
The ladies and gentlemen from Jaffna are well equipped to provide you with an authentic cuisine experience during the festival, in addition to demonstrations and other interactive sessions. It is a unique gateway to grasp and appreciate Jaffnas rich cultural and culinary heritage.
Enjoy Yalpanam. It is a yummy experience.

13th Amendment powered PCs to enact legislation
Parliament had the sole authority to enact legislation in the country upto 1987. However, the 13th amendment to the Constitution had given provisions to provincial councils to enact legislation superseding those of parliament, Attorney Manohara de Silva PC said in Galle on February 17.
He was addressing a conference on the new Constitution held at the Galle Intellectuals' Committee at the Galle Sports Pavilion.
De Silva said five Presidents including Chandrika Bandaranaike assumed power in this country, but they did not fully implement the 13th amendment. "Given this situation, the statement made by Northern Former Chief Minister Vigneswaran that he would exercise law and order and land powers could not be lightly dismissed. Vigneswaran was a retired Supreme Court Judge, and a legal luminary. He had also threatened to institute a court to hear allegations of crimes against war heroes if the government failed to do so.
"Vigneswaren said he would not release even an inch of land to extend the northern airport. Formulation of a new constitution was not a big issue for him.
But the problem was the renewed talk about existing laws and regulations which had remained dormant for nearly 30 years," he said.
Silva said provincial councils could implement laws for a division of the country with the the 13th amendment.
But only the President has the powers to defeat any moves taken to divide the country. That is why separatists were clamouring to abolish the Executive Presidency. The 19th amendment watered down the Executive Presidency and handed its powers to the legislature.
The Police Commission was appointed by the legislature. The Constitutional Council was a joke. It was created to weaken the powers of the Central Government, he said.

Abide by accepted norms, Rajapaksa calls
It is essential to abide by the accepted practice in making judicial appointments to safeguard the independence of the Judiciary, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in a statement yesterday said.
Rajapaksa said the Judicial Services Association of Sri Lanka has strongly objected to the appointment of Ramanathan Kannan, a lawyer practicing at the Private Bar in Batticaloa as a High Court Judge.
The accepted practice in this country is that virtually all judges serving in the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and High Court are promoted to those positions through the ranks of the judicial service or to a lesser extent, the Attorney Generals Department, Rajapaksa noted.
This system of promotion based on seniority and merit is one of the pillars on which the independence of the judiciary rests. On very rare occasions, past governments have appointed eminent members of the Private Bar as Supreme Court judges. Former CJ Neville Samarakoon and Justice Mark Fernando came into the Supreme Court in that manner. In the nine years that I was President, I appointed only one Supreme Court judge from the Private Bar. No members of the Private Bar were appointed to either the Court of Appeal or the High Court by my government, he said.

Access Engineering creates learning ambiance for Rural Schools
A large amount of a childs time is spent sitting in a classroom. Classroom is thus the place where a child learns various skills deemed necessary and proper for them to achieve success in education as well as in society. A stimulating learning ambience in the classroom is a prerequisite for the effective and continual learning process.
A main challenge faced by the education sector in Sri Lanka is not so much about the improvements in school enrollments, but about improving the quality of education. It was identified that the current learning environment of many rural and less facilitated schools scattered across Sri Lanka is not conducive to provide effective learning opportunities for children due to the paucity of necessary infrastructure.
Recognizing the challenge faced by the education sector in Sri Lanka, Access Engineering PLC, one of the major conglomerates in Sri Lanka recently signed an MOU with the Department of Technical Education and Training for the production and distribution of desks and chairs to a selection of less facilitated schools around the country.
Children at Hathagoda Baudda Prathamika Vidyalaya- Kegalle with new desks and chairs
The scope of the project includes the supply of raw materials and other consumables, the labour cost and facility utilization rentals to the Department of Technical Education and Training (DTET) and DTET is to produce 1200 pairs of desks and chairs per year according to the standard proposed by the Ministry of Education. The project is currently executed in number of technical colleges under the Department of Technical Education and Training (DTET) and a total of 200 pairs of desks and chairs have been already distributed among 06 schools in Hambantota, Walasmulla, Horana, Kegalle and Kamburupitiya. It is scheduled to distribute the total of 1200 pairs of desks and chairs among a selection of 36 schools within the year 2017. The ability to learn in a tranquil and undisturbed environment is a gift that should be experienced by all children.
Most of the rural schools in Sri Lanka are unable to procure the required infrastructure from the available funds. We consider it a pleasure to be able to initiate this project which has direct benefit to the children of today and tomorrow Said General Manager; Srimal Fernando

CIFL was the weeks highest price loser, declining 28.57% W-o-W to close at LKR 1.00. SMB Leasing (-16.17% W-o-W), Kelsey Developments (-20.23% W-o-W) and City Housing (-14.29% W-o-W) also declined.
Point of view
Indices hit a 4-week high of 6175.50 on Wednesday supported mainly by positive Q4 earnings (72% of corporates reported earnings with 52% of the reported companies recording a Y-o-Y gains) before slipping by 16 points to end at 6159.87 on Friday. Active buying interest in Diversified, Banking, Finance & Insurance counters, meanwhile pushed the average turnover levels to LKR 0.63bn, 20% higher than last weeks average turnover of LKR 0.53Bn and 2% Higher than 2017 daily average turnover of LKR 0.62Bn.
HNI and Institutional buying interest meanwhile, increased this week as large off-board parcels contributed 51.7% to market turnover relative to last weeks value of 23% , amid strong interest in JKH (52% of crossings), Lion Brewery (10% of crossings), Hemas Holdings & Access Engineering (each accounting to 9% of crossings) Foreign investors continued to remain net buyers for the 3rd consecutive week in February, with the net inflows to the Bourse improving to LKR 1.42Bn for the month which helped to ease off the net outflow from equity markets to LKR 0.24Bn (cf. LKR 1.66Bn recorded in Jan17).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to be influenced by direction of the rest of the earnings particularly earnings from December ending companies such as Banks.
Earnings of 72% of Market Broadly Positive
Corporate earnings for the quarter ending December 2016 have been trickling in and have, so far been positive. Market earnings of ~72% of corporates have been broadly positive with 52% of the reported companies recording a Y-o-Y gain in quarterly earnings. (For the 72% of the reported companies, the counters representing the oil palms sector were excluded as exceptional profits were recorded with the disposal of overseas plantation assets).
Total market earnings thus far amount to ~LKR 37Bn (excluding earnings from counters in palm oil) relative to LKR 33Bn reported by the same companies in December 2015.(up ~12% Y-o-Y). Counters in the Diversified (+36% Y-o-Y), Beverage, Food & Tobacco (+19% Yo-Y),Construction (+34% Y-o-Y), Hotel & Travels (+7% Y-o-Y) & Telecommunication (+101% Y-o-Y) sectors increased their contribution to total market earnings over the quarter, while counters in the Manufacturing (-3% Y-o-Y) , Motors (-47% Y-o-Y), Investment Trust (-122% Y-o-Y) & Footwear & Textile (-55% Y-o-Y) recorded Y-o-Y declines.
Remaining Counters that are left to report earnings (particularly counters that falls in to the December year end such as Banks, Finance & Insurance companies) are expected to release their earnings over the week ahead and will likely help provide overall market direction in terms of corporate earnings.
On the macro-front meanwhile, the LKR closed at an average of 150.71 (per USD) by close of trade on Friday, representing a~0.6% depreciation against the USD over the year.

Adolf Hitler's wartime telephone sells for 195,000

Hitler's personal telephone - used to dictate many of his deadly Second World War commands - has been sold at auction for 195,000.
The phone was described by the auction house as "Hitler's mobile device of destruction" and "the primary tool used by the most evil man in history".
The Siemens rotary Bakelite phone - originally black before being painted pillar-box red - features a swastika, an eagle and Adolf Hitler's name engraved onto the back.
The phone had been given to British officer Brigadier Ralph Rayner by occupying Russian officers when he visited Hitler's bunker in Berlin in 1945 following the regime's defeat.
Now more than 70 years old, the device - which must be rotated almost 60 degrees in order to release it from its cradle - was used by Hitler in vehicles and trains, as well as at his field headquarters.
The unnamed bidder placed his winning bid by phone.
At the same auction, a porcelain figure of an Alsatian dog, also owned by Hitler, was sold to a different bidder for 19,500.
Hitler - who liked to portray himself as an animal lover - had a German Shepherd named Blondi who appeared alongside him in various forms of Nazi propaganda.

Angelina Jolie on Cambodia, politics and a 'difficult year'

Angelina Jolie has spoken about how Cambodia was her "awakening", as she premiered her new film in the country.
The actress was speaking exclusively to the BBC before the screening of First They Killed My Father, a true-life account of the Khmer Rouge genocide through the eyes of a child.
She said she hoped the film, which she directed, would help Cambodians to speak more openly about the trauma of the period.
Two million people died.
Jolie, now a UN refugee agency special envoy, first visited Cambodia for the filming of 2001 hit Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.
She later adopted Maddox, her oldest son, from Cambodia.
"I came to this country and I fell in love with its people and learned its history, and in doing so learned, how little I actually knew about the world," she told the BBC's Yalda Hakim.
"This country, for me was my awakening.
"I'll always be very grateful to this country. I don't think I ever could give back as much as this country has given me."
'Not properly understood'
First They Killed My Father is based on a book of the same name by Loung Ung.
Ung was five when she and her family were forced to leave their home in the capital, Phnom Penh, by the Khmer Rouge, the regime which ran the country between 1975 and 1979, under Pol Pot.
It is estimated that about two million people, around a quarter of the population, were either murdered by the regime or died from starvation and overwork.
"I thought that this war that happened 40 years ago, and what happened to these people, was not properly understood," said Jolie.
The film is predominantly in the local Khmer language, and Jolie said that while she wanted the wider world to better understand events in Cambodia she hoped it would have an impact domestically too.
"I hope it helps the country speak more," she said, as many survivors "haven't told their children their story".
'Difficult time'
The film, made by Netflix, was given its world premiere on Saturday inside the Angkor Wat temple complex in Siem Reap, where Tomb Raider was partly filmed.
Among those present alongside Jolie and her six children was Cambodia's King Norodom Sihamoni, who in 2005 granted the actress Cambodian citizenship for the work done by an environmental foundation she established in the country.
The premiere was the first major public appearance for Jolie since she filed for divorce from Brad Pitt in September last year, citing irreconcilable differences.
The couple had been together since 2004 but only married in August 2014.
"It was very difficult," Jolie said. "Many people find themselves in this situation. My whole family have all been through a difficult time. My focus is my children, our children.
"We are and forever will be a family and so that is how I am coping. I am coping with finding a way through to make sure that this somehow makes us stronger and closer."
'Speaking out'
Jolie recently wrote a piece for the New York Times in response to US President Donald Trump's immigration ban, calling for her homeland to make decisions based on fact rather than fear.
She was reluctant to talk specifically about Mr Trump but said: "The American people are bigger than any president. I suppose I have faith in my country and in what it is founded on and the values we hold dear.
"I believe that many of the things that we're hearing that we feel are based on a sense of spreading fear or hate or dividing people by race or judgement is un-American.
"At this time I think what is amazing is we are seeing people around the world start to speak out for their civil liberties and rights and what they feel. In America, we are hearing people say 'this is un-American to me, this is unconstitutional to me. And this is who I am'."

An upcoming Apple iPhone is likely to have a customized wireless charging system made with Broadcom, according to JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur.

Mark Neuling | CNBC iPhone 7 An upcoming Apple iPhone is likely to have a customized wireless charging system made with Broadcom, according to JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur.

Apple to start making iPhone SE models in India Friday, 17 Feb 2017 | 10:44 AM ET | 00:35Still, Surs prediction falls in line with other predictions for the next iPhone. Top Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo expects all three iPhones released this year will have wireless charging, and Apple confirmed to CNBC on Monday that it has joined the Wireless Power Consortium.
Wireless charging also makes sense alongside rumors that the next iPhone will be mostly glass.
We believe the glass back cover is conducive to wireless charging as it reduces signal interference versus a metal casing, Sur wrote. It is possible for Apple to add proprietary features such as fast charging or extended charging to differentiate itself from the pack and enhance the value of its own hardware ecosystem.
Apple, which typically doesnt weigh in on speculation about new products, declined to comment to CNBC.
Sur estimated that iPhone charging upgrade could grow to a $500 million to $600 million opportunity for Broadcom. Broadcoms shares closed 1 percent higher on Friday.(CNBC)

He spoke fluent Tamil and he was popular in the Eastern Province. He was instrumental in establishing a fisheries office in Trincomalee.

N. B. Amarasinghe
Popular among students
Nawaratne Bandara Amarasinghe who served as the Registrar, University of Kelaniya passed away on January 31, 2013 and this is in appreciation of his irreplaceable service to the university as well as for his social contribution. He was born in Kegalle, Mawanella on November 24, 1940.
After receiving primary education in Galapitamada Maha Vidyalaya, Kegalle, he received secondary education from St. Annes College, Kurunegala. Thereafter, he entered the University of Sri Jayewardenepura in 1967 and earned a BA honors degree in Archaeology in 1970. After finishing higher education, he served at the Department of Archaeology Sri Lanka for a short period.
In 1973, he joined as an Assistant Registrar at the University of Kelaniya where he carried out a yeoman service taking up the post of Senior Assistant Registrar and the Registrar post in 1990. After retiring, he was a Council Member of Ruhuna University and later joined the same University as a Visiting Lecturer in Archeology. His field of teaching was Numismatics which is one of the rare and significant areas of study in Archeology. Amarasinghe was a very popular Visiting Lecturer among the students who followed the Numismatics course of Archeology at the University of Kelaniya too.
A quality which he owned was the humanity.
He exhibited an exemplary life as the Registrar of the University of Kelaniya preserving both the administrative and human qualities that many officers and certain laymen in society are lacking.
For his honor, I wish to remind how he supported all four categories in the University, starting with the vice-Chancellor, the teaching and non-teaching staff, particularly the students. He supported others when a person met with problems at his or her personal or professional life. After retirement, he carried out a remarkable service to develop the Welfare Society at St. Jude Lane Dalugama, Kelaniya where he spent a benevolent life, until his demise by introducing a number of social activities.
Loving kindness, charismatic leadership, philanthropy and audaciousness were some of his qualities which everybody in society should stick to.
May he attained Nibbana!

A. R. M. Abdul Cader
Inspiring statesman
The name A.R.M. Abdul Cader, former MP and Minister, one of the well-known philanthropists of our time, should be remembered so that our future generation could draw inspiration from his life and commit themselves to uphold the principle of justice and fair play to create a better society, said former Muslim Affairs Minister and Muslim Progressive Society Secretary General A.H.M. Azwer.
He was addressing the ceremony to commemorate former MP and Minister A.R.M. Abdul Cader, in Gampola recently.
Azwer recalled the names of great philanthropists of the past such N.D.H. Abdul Caffoor, Sir Mohamed Macan Markar, EL Ibrahim Hajiar and Naleem Hajiar of Beruwela, who spent their wealth to establish Arabic madrasas and centres of Islamic learning, and distributed their wealth among the poor, irrespective of community and caste.
Cader Hajiar ranks equal to such highly honoured leaders of the past. But it was a travesty of justice that, as it happens nowadays, Cader Hajiar fell victim to political vengeance when he was taken into prison remand for the crime of distributing rice to the poor and needy from funds obtained from government sources. Political vendetta sees bounds, Azwe said.
He added that Cader Hajiar closely moved with even the Mahanayake Theras of Malwatte and Asgiriya. He was a true friend of the people of all communities; Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims alike, the like of whom, perhaps, shall not be born for another century. He, therefore, suggested the creation of an Abdul Cader Trust so that his benevolence be continued among all people in the country, Azwer said.
Former Prime Minister D. M. Jayaratne presided. Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake, Posts and Muslim Affairs Minister M H A Haleem, senior citizen Peter Gangadara, Provincial Council members Hidayath Sathar, Lafir Hajiar, former MP S. Rajaratnam and several others also addressed the gathering.
Former PC member Mohamed Amjad Rafeek proposed the vote of thanks. A resolution was passed to request the Provincial Council to rename Ambagamuwa road as Abdul Cader Hajiar Mawatha.

Raja received intensive training in the United Kingdom and ILO training centres in the field to Training Within Industry. He used his expertise to train a large number of supervisory personnel in our public enterprises and the training programmes he introduced in the seventies are being continued even at present with slight amendments. He travelled all over the island conducting in-house training programmes in most of the state corporations and the NIBM training centres in Kurunegala and Kandy.
Raja was an indefatigable worker and a management education professional who contributed immensely to the development of our managers and supervisors thereby assisting their organizations to enhance productivity. His training sessions were informative and entertaining, and he helped many to progress in their careers.
Raja was a conscientious professional who fulfilled his official responsibilities to the satisfaction of all his superiors, peers and students. He was a very sincere friend and one of the most pleasant persons to work with. He shared his expertise with all his colleagues and provided professional assistance to anybody who sought it. He was a livewire during the many official trips and social activities conducted at the NIBM.
After his retirement, he provided voluntary services to many of the community and social development activities in and around Polgasovita where he resided with his family. He took a very active role in helping his fellow men to enhance their quality of lives. He led a simple and exemplary life, and was a role model to his colleagues, friends, students and community members.
May he attain Nibbana!

Atapattu seals Sri Lanka Womens World Cup spot
Former captain Chamari Atapattu starred with the bat as Sri Lanka clinched a rain-curtailed game played at the NCC grounds by 42 runs on D/L method against Bangladesh yesterday to seal their World Cup berth.
India, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Pakistan complete the eight-team line-up for the 2017 ICC Womens World Cup, slated to be held in the UK in June-July. Australia, England, New Zealand and West Indies qualified directly, having finished in the top-four of the 2014-16 ICC Womens ODI Championship.
Put into bat first, Nipuni Hansika and Hasini Perera got Sri Lanka off to a decent start, before Atapattu added fifty runs for the second wicket with the latter.
Bangladesh then managed to take wickets at regular intervals to restrict the hosts, but the left-hander stood tall, making 84 off 114 balls with eight fours and a six, as Salma Khatun bowled a tight line to take three wickets.
Chasing 198, Nigar Sultana fought hard in the top-order, but Bangladesh were never really in the hunt as Udeshika Prabodhani took two wickets in her first two overs. Shaila Sharmin looked determined to take the attack to the opposition, but lost partners cheaply, before rain ensured no more play was possible after 21 overs with the scoreboard reading 68 for 5. The loss confirmed Bangladeshs exit from the World Cup race.
OTHER MATCHES
Ekta Bishts sensational five-wicket haul helped India thrash Pakistan by seven wickets in their final Super Six game on Sunday at the P Sara Oval and remain unbeaten in the ongoing ICC Womens World Cup Qualifier, 2017.

Bisht led Indias charge by bowling as many as seven maiden overs enroute her five-wicket haul, at the cost of just eight runs. Despite the loss, Pakistan managed to grab the last available spot for the eight-team mega event in UK.
Scores: Pakistan Women 67 in 43.4 overs (Ayesha Zafar 19, Bismah Maroof 13; Ekta Bisht 5-8, Shikha Pandey 2-9)
India Women 70-3 in 22.3 overs (Deepti Sharma 29, Harmanpreet Kaur 24; Sadia Yousuf 2-19).
In the other match played at the CCC grounds a solid reply from Laura Wolvaardt and Mignon du Preez meant South Africa were declared winners by 36 runs on D/L method against Ireland, despite rain allowing only 21 overs of their chase.
With three consecutive losses in the Super Sixes stage, Ireland lost out on the World Cup berth.

Bale back with a bang as Real extend lead
MADRID, Saturday  Gareth Bale made an instant impact on his return from injury as Real Madrid extended their lead at the top of La Liga to three points with a 2-0 win over Espanyol on Saturday.
Bale had only been on the pitch 13 minutes after three months on the sidelines due to ankle ligament damage when he swept home into the far corner seven minutes from time to round off a rapid Real counter-attack.
Alvaro Morata had opened the scoring when he bulleted home Isco's cross 12 minutes before half-time.
Elsewhere, Sevilla moved above Barcelona -- who are in action on Sunday at home to Leganes -- into second thanks to a 2-0 win over Eibar.
I was happy just to be on the pitch. To get a goal is an extra bonus and thankful to help the team and see the game off, said Bale.
It's been a difficult time but when you get a reception like that it makes it all worth it.
Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane made seven changes to the side that started Wednesday's 3-1 Champions League last 16, first-leg win against Napoli with difficult La Liga trips to Valencia and Villarreal to come in the next week in mind.
Morata was one of those handed a rare chance to start up front with Karim Benzema left out of the squad altogether.
The Spanish international hadn't started any of Real's previous five league games, but made his case for more minutes as he powered home Isco's fine in-swinging cross for his 11th goal of the season.
Bale's much-anticipated return since injuring ankle ligaments away at Sporting Lisbon on November 22 came 20 minutes from time when he replaced Morata.
And the Welshman showed the home fans what they have been missing as again Isco was the provider for Bale to finish off a lightning quick Real counter-attack by firing into the far corner.
We only have one Gareth Bale, said Zidane.
We are happy to see Gareth back with the team. He is a special player, he gives us something different from the rest.
Sevilla remain three points behind Madrid as they warmed up for their Champions League clash with struggling English champions Leicester City on Wednesday with victory.
Pablo Sarabia netted the opener when he side-footed home Stefan Jovetic's pinpoint cross after half an hour.
Adrian Gonzalez fired inches wide for the visitors after the break as a first defeat in four leaves Eibar still in seventh.
Spanish international Vitolo sealed the points in stoppage time as he fired in from close range thanks to another Jovetic assist.
Atletico Madrid tightened their grip on fourth thanks to a five-minute hat-trick from substitute Kevin Gameiro in a 4-1 win at Sporting Gijon.
Gameiro was seconds away from making history as he just missed out on beating David Villa's record for the fastest hat-trick in La Liga history.
The Frenchman was only introduced 28 minutes from time but struck in the 80th, 81st and 85th minutes and dedicated the hat-trick to his recently deceased grandmother.
Those goals are for my grandmother, who died this week. I scored three for her, he said.

Balotelli sent off in Nice victory
PARIS, Saturday  Mario Balotelli was sent off on his return to the Nice team but Lucien Favres side held on for a 1-0 win at Lorient on Saturday which sees them close the gap on Ligue 1 leaders Monaco.
Wylan Cyprien scored the only goal of the game in Brittany, collecting Arnaud Souquets pass and firing home from inside the area in the 15th minute.
The result allowed Nice to go back above Paris Saint-Germain into second place and close to within three points of Monaco, who could only draw 1-1 at Bastia on Friday.
Balotelli was sent off after apparently talking out of turn to match referee Tony Chapron midway through the second half.
It was his third red card this season in the French top flight, although his first, also against Lorient back in October, was later overturned. The Italian, who has scored nine league goals, has endured a frustrating couple of weeks -- he was dropped from the team for a 1-0 win against Saint-Etienne and then missed last weeks draw at Rennes due to illness, but returned in Lorient in place of leading scorer Alassane Plea.
It was a first away win since the end of November for Nice, while Lorient remain rooted to the foot of the table.
Defending champions PSG, fresh from their famous win against Barcelona in the Champions League in midweek, can leapfrog Nice again and cut Monacos lead to a single point if they beat Toulouse at the Parc des Princes on Sunday night.
Elsewhere, Marseille overcame the absence of injured leading scorer Bafetimbi Gomis to beat Rennes 2-0 and boost their hopes of European qualification.
Clinton Njie and Florian Thauvin, the latter with a superb strike, both netted in the second half for the hosts as Marseille moved to within a point of fourth-placed Lyon, albeit having played two games more.
We had an obligation to win here and it was quite an accomplished performance, said Marseille coach Rudi Garcia, whose team face great rivals PSG next. Life without Bafe is possible, but in a different style. Now we have eight days before the match against PSG, but first of all we will enjoy this result.
On-loan Swansea City striker Gomis, scorer of 16 league goals this season, suffered a knee injury in last weekends defeat at Nantes that will rule him out for around a month.
Njie, filling in as the central striker, fired home first-time after the ball broke to him inside the area to open the scoring just before the hour mark.
Five minutes later Marseille had scored again thanks to a superb goal from Thauvin as he smashed a shot high into the net on his left foot to make it 2-0. There was no way back after that for Rennes, who have now gone 10 league games without a win.
Lille eased their relegation fears with a 1-0 win at fellow strugglers Caen in their first game under new coach Franck Passi.
They had defender Adama Soumaoro sent off just after the hour mark but Anwar El Ghazi, a January signing from Ajax, struck the only goal of the game with 20 minutes left. Giant Malian striker Cheick Diabates late penalty secured a 1-1 draw for Metz at home to Nantes and Angers beat Nancy 1-0.  AFP

In between fiction and real
The voices of fictional characters can stay with us long after we turn the final page Fictional characters can influence readers in real life, a study has found.
Durham University researchers surveyed more than 1,500 readers and asked 400 of those to provide detailed descriptions of their experiences with a book. 19 per cent of those said that the voices of fictional characters stayed with them after they had finished reading, influences the tone of their thoughts and even directly "speaking" to them. According to one of the paper's authors, writer and psychologist Charles Fernyhough, the study shows how readers of fiction are actively recreating the worlds and characters described by the writer.
"For many of us, this can involve experiencing the characters in a novel as people we interact with," he said. "One in seven of our respondents, for example, said they heard the voices of fictional characters as clearly as if there was someone in the room with them."
The study was carried out in collaboration with the Guardian at the 2014 Edinburgh international book festival, and also learned that characters heard the voices of characters while reading most or all of the time. -Independent

BJP weighing up political split in Rajapaksa camp
Even as Sri Lankas former President Mahinda Rajapaksa angles for a political comeback, New Delhi appears to be weighing up possible political shifts in the island, including a split in the Rajapaksa camp.
On February 10, BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav, known to be Prime Minister Narendra Modis point man on Sri Lanka, met President Maithripala Sirisena and PM Ranil Wickremesinghe in Colombo, a week before Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankars scheduled official visit.
Madhav also met a few other key political actors, The Hindu learns, and reportedly discussed political options that might neutralise former strongman Rajapaksa.
Confirming that he met the President and the Prime Minister to discuss bilateral issues and a forthcoming Indian Ocean conference in the island, Madhav, when contacted in New Delhi, said the [other] allegations are false.
While he categorically denied having discussed the former first family in any of his meetings, political sources in Colombo told The Hindu that the BJPs key strategist seemed to explore the possibility of Gotabaya Rajapaksa decamping from Mahinda Rajapaksa in return for high political office.
One of Sri Lankas most controversial figures and brother of the ex-President, Gotabaya was prominent in the leadership to defeat the LTTE, playing a key role as Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development.
Currently facing corruption charges for allegedly transferring state-owned weapons to a private firm, causing a loss of nearly $75 million to the country, he has been a staunch critic of the governments reconciliation strategy.
While Madhavs reported enquiries about him have raised eyebrows in political circles, its timing is also significant.
Two years after coming to power, Sri Lankas national unity government  formed by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) that President Sirisena leads and its rival United National Party with PM Wickremesinghe at the helm  is pulling apart.
Amid mounting criticism over the governments delay in delivering its key election promises, coupled with looming corruption charges, the government is facing another immediate task for its survival  managing the ex-President, who leads a faction of the SLFP. This political grouping is challenging virtually every move of the government as a joint opposition in Parliament. (The Hindu)

Blanks
When I had first moved to New York from Reno, I found an apartment on Mulberry Street and planned to make films with the camera I never returned to the art department at the University of Nevada, a Bolex Pro. I arrived with the camera, my savings from selling my motorcycle, and a phone number for Chris Kelly, my single contact. I was twenty-one. I figured Id wait to call mythical Chris Kelly, a UNR student I had known only slightly. He had been shot in the arm by Nina Simone when he tried to make a film about her. Ill get situated first, I thought. Ill have some sense of what Im doing, a way to make an impression on him. Then Ill call. I knew no one else, but downtown New York was so alive with people my age, and so thoroughly abandoned by most others, that the energy of the young seeped out of the ground. I figured it was only a matter of time before I met people, was part of something.
My apartment was about as blank and empty as my new life, with its layers upon layers of white paint, like a plaster death mask of the two rooms, giving them an ancient urban feeling, and I didnt want to mute that effect with furniture and clutter.
Unmatched linoleum
The floor was an interlocking map of various unmatched linoleum pieces in faded floral reds, like a cracked and soiled Matisse. It was almost bare, except for a trunk that held my clothes, a few books, the stolen or borrowed Bolex, a Nikon F (my own), and a mans brown felt hat, owner unknown. I had no cups, no table, nothing of that sort. The mattress I slept on had been there when I rented. I had one faded pink towel, on its edge machine embroidered pickwick. It was from a hotel in San Francisco. I knew a girl who had cleaned rooms there and I somehow ended up with the towel, which seemed fancier than a regular towel because it had a provenance, like shoes from Spain or perfume from France. A towel from the Pickwick. The hat was a Borsalino Id found in the bathroom of a bar. I wrapped my jacket around it, rather than giving it to the bartender. It decorated the empty apartment. Each morning I went to a coffee shop near my apartment, the Trust E on Lafayette, and sat at the counter. The same waitress was always there. The men who came into that coffee shop tried to pick her up. She was pretty and, perhaps more importantly, had large breasts framed in a low-cut waitressing smock.
Hey, whats your name a man in a yellow hard hat said to her one morning as he stared at her breasts and dug in the pocket of his work overalls to pay his check.
She glanced at the radio behind the counter. My name is .<U+2009>.<U+2009>. Zenith, she said, smiling at him with her slightly crooked teeth.
That was the precise moment I wanted to be friends with Giddleher actual name, or at least the one I knew her by.
There are no palm trees on Fourteenth Street, but I remember them there, black palm fronds against indigo dusk, the night I met the people with the gun.
That was how I thought of them, before I knew who any of them were. The people with the gun.
I had been in New York a month, and the city to me seemed strange and wondrous and lonely. The July air was damp and hot. It was late afternoon. The overcrowded sidewalk, with young girls standing along Union Square in shorts and halters the size of popped balloons, electronics stores with salsa blaring, the Papaya King and its mangoes and bananas piled up in the window, all made Fourteenth Street feel like the main thoroughfare of a tropical city, someplace in the Caribbean or South America, though I had never been to the Caribbean or South America, and Im not sure where I saw palm fronds. Once it became familiar, Fourteenth Street never looked that way to me again.
I remember a rainbow spectrum of mens wing tips parked in rows, triple-A narrow, the leather dyed snake green, lemon yellow, and unstable shades of vermilion and Ditto-ink blue. All of humanity dresses in uniforms of one sort or another, and these shoes were for pimps.
I was on the west end of Fourteenth. My feet, swollen from the heat, were starting to hurt. I heard music from the doorway of a bar, soft piano notes, and then a singer who flung her voice over a horn section. What difference does it make, which one I choose Either way I lose. A voice so low it sounded like a female voice artificially slowed. It was Nina Simones. A piano note and a mans baritone voice percussed together, and then higher piano notes came tumbling down to meet the low ones. I went in.
The music was loud and distorted by the echoing room, where a man and woman sat close together at the far end of a bar, the sole customers. The woman had the kind of beauty I associated with the pedigreed rich. A pale complexion, cuticle thin, stretched over high cheekbones, and thick, wavy hair that was the warm, reddish blonde of cherrywood.
Paneled ceiling
The man conducted the song with the tiny straw from his drink, jerking his arm in the air to the saxophone and the cartwheeling piano notes, which fell down over us as if from the perforations in the bars paneled ceiling. The horns and strings and piano and the womans voice all rode along together and then came to an abrupt halt. The room fell into drafty silence.
The woman sniffled, her head down, hair flopped over her face, curtains drawn for a moment of private sorrow, although I sensed she was faking.
Why dont you sit down, the man called to me in a nasal and Southern voice. Youre making us nervous. He wore a suit and tie but there was something derelict about him, not detectable in his fine clothes. The woman looked up at me, a glisten of wet on her cheeks.
Shes not making anybody nervous, she said, and wiped under her eyes with the pads of her fingers, careful not to scratch herself with long nails painted glossy red.
I realized Id been wrong. She was not the pedigreed rich. He was and she was not. Sometimes all the information is there in the first five minutes, laid out for inspection. Then it goes away, gets suppressed as a matter of pragmatism. Its too much to know a lot about strangers. But some dont end up strangers. They end up closer, and you had your five minutes to see what they were really like and you missed it. Come on, honey, she said to me in a voice like a soft bell, sit down and shithead will buy you a drink.

Blended emphases
Hidden and almost forgotten in the recesses of Borella cemetery lie between fifteen and twenty gravestones marked with Hebrew script. These tombs are among the last signs of the complex, fading history of Jews in Sri Lanka, a history that dates back over 1000 years.Though sequential bouts of colonisation have erased much of the history of Jews on the island, a few shards of evidence and rumours of varying trustworthiness survive today.
Danny Perera
A 9th century Sinhalese king allegedly had four Jewish advisers in his court. In the 10th century, the Persian traveller Abu Zeid al Hasan, reported that he had encountered many Jews while staying in Sri Lanka. And 200 years later Benjamin of Tudela, a Jewish adventurer from Spain, wrote that he had found around 3000 Jews living in Sri Lanka.While the fate of those early Jewish communities is unclear, they most likely assimilated once the Portuguese arrived and have since blended into the population. So it follows that a good people with Jewish ancestors are living in Sri Lanka though the vast majority do not know it.
However, during the colonization, waves of European Jews accompanied both Portuguese and Dutch to Sri Lanka to escape persecution. JB Mller, a deceased journalist and researcher on Sri Lankas Burghers, believed that many Burghers have Jewish roots due to the influx of Jews during the early colonial times.Several common Sri Lankan names have Jewish roots; de Fonseka might be the progeny of those named de Fonseca, a name closely linked to Portuguese Jews.
But the Burghers either converted or lost the knowledge of their Jewish ancestry, and there is no any semblance of a Sri Lankan Jewish community any longer.
While Sri Lanka has scant extant proof to back up these particular claims of Jewish arrival, a functioning Synagogue was on Galle Road, just opposite the Cinnamon Grand. Anne Ranasinghe, the famous Sri Lankan Jewish Poet, wrote that Jewish troops in the British Army used the Synagogue during the World War II. It was demolished sometime during the 1950s or early 1960s.
Though Sri Lanka lacks a community of practising local Jews, a Chabad House, akin to a Jewish community and religious center, has sprung up on Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha, just across the street from Cinnamon Red.
Chabad House
Given the dearth of Sri Lankan Jews, the Chabad House caters to a small number of Jewish transplants living in Colombo and to Jewish travellers, mostly Israeli, but also French, British, and American.
The grave with Hebrew writing in the Borella cemetery
Founded just before the end of the war, the House is run by Rabbi Shneor Maidanchik. Though it might seem akin to a Christian mission, the Chabad House is not meant to convert anyone. The Rabbi himself doesnt proselytise, but he does hold services every Friday for Shabbat and on each Jewish Holiday.The Chabad House serves as both a Synagogue and meeting place for Jews who live here and who pass through, Maidanchik said. We get people from all over who come to surf, do business, or buy gems, tea, and coconut products. I see myself as an ambassador of the Jewish faith to Sri Lanka.
The House has a kosher restaurant at which anyone can eat. It is also the site of Sri Lankas only Mikveh, or bath used for ritual immersion in Jewish practice.A second Chabad House also rotates between Hikkaduwa and Arugam Bay depending on the season.
Its my goal to host Jewish people and make them feel comfortable and at home here, Maidanchik said.Ziv Molcho, an Israeli, who has lived in Sri Lanka for 10 years and runs a travel company, noted that the Chabad House is an important gathering place for Jewish people both living in and passing through the country.
Its a nice, safe place to gather for and celebrate holidays together and to eat good, Jewish food, Molcho said. He said he does not come to every Friday Shabbat service, but he talks to the Rabbi every day and tries to learn from him.Its very nice to have a group of familiar faces who meet from time to time and have interesting discussions, said Shmuel Kenigsberg, who first came to Colombo to set up fish and tea businesses over 15 years ago.
While Jews all over the world often face racism and anti-semitism, Molcho noted that he has not experienced such problems in Sri Lanka.I have had no trouble being Jewish here. Im glad to have a good relationship with my neighbours, and I have faced no problems after telling people that Im Jewish or that Im from Israel, he said.
Most Sri Lankans dont know much about Judaism. Many think its a form of Christianity. Its confusing for them, he said.
The Last Lankan Jew
Though a functioning community of Sri Lankan Jews has not been for a long time, Sri Lanka had famous Jews. The first people to cultivate coffee, and then tea in Sri Lanka were the Jewish - Austrian de Worms brothers. Several British Jews held high positions in the colonial administration as well.Musaeus College is named after Marie Musaeus Higgins, A Jewish woman from Germany. But the most notable Sri Lankan Jew of recent times is undoubtedly poet Anne Ranasinghe, who died just two months ago. After fleeing Germany during the World War II and ending up in England, she married a Sri Lankan professor of medicine and moved to Colombo, where she enjoyed great literary success.
Chabad House
Ranasinghe referred to herself as the only Sri Lankan Jew, but this is only half true. A Jew at birth, she later became Sri Lankan. Danny Perera, on the other hand, was born a Buddhist Sri Lankan, but has since converted to Judaism.Perera grew up in Mount Lavinia in the 1950s surrounded by Jewish people. His parents rented rooms to Jews who had fled the Holocaust, and his uncle, who had served in the British Army during World War II, married an Egyptian Jew before moving back to Sri Lanka.
Though I didnt know it at the time, many of my friends were Jewish, and my aunt kept a Kosher house, so I grew up around Jewish people, Perera said.In 1972, he decamped to the Friedrich-Alexander University in Erlangen to study German. Upon his arrival, he realised that he would be sharing his student apartment with several Jews.
I was the only non-Jew in that dorm, and the others told me that I should go to Israel. My uncle and his wife had moved there with their children in 1967, and I met them down there in 1978, Perera said.I stayed with them for quite some time. They didnt want me to leave, and then I found an Israeli girlfriend. She didnt make me convert, but I thought that I should learn about Judaism if I am going to live in Israel.
After taking a six-month course on Jewish religion in Jerusalem, he approached a rabbi about converting. The Rabbi questioned Pereras motives at length, even asking why he would want to be a member of a group that has suffered so much over the years, the Rabbi gave his permission and Perera converted.I was very interested in Jewish history and customs. The religion has a very long history, and I find that it keeps the generations and families together. Its a difficult religion and it has a difficult history, but I wanted to be a part of it, he said.
Perera was then promptly drafted into the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), and, after doing a year plus of training, he served for 45 days a year for 15 years, seeing action several times. During his time in the IDF, Perera married his girlfriend Abiba and had two children. He also opened seven garment factories that specialised in dying fabric.
After living in Tel Aviv for over 20 years, Perera decided to move back to Sri Lanka in 2000.I couldnt keep up with the Chinese in the garment industry. Their prices were too low, so I decided to move back and open up a fish-processing factory. I sent my first shipment of fish to Israel, though he said.
His children and wife still live in Tel Aviv, but Perera has thrown himself into helping the Chabad House thrive. It was by chance that he ran into Mendy Kromby, the Rabbi, who set up the House about eight years ago.I was in Hikkaduwa, and I saw a Rabbi walking in the road. I stopped and asked him what hes doing there, and he said he wanted to set up a Chabad house. I thought this was a great idea, and I helped him set it up. The property is registered to me, and I helped get the necessary visas, he said.
Central to Pereras project at Chabad House is to create a legitimate Jewish community in Colombo.Its not a big deal that Im converted, because Judaism feels very natural to me. I want to build a Jewish society in Sri Lanka. That is what Im fighting for. Because I know that Jewish people have lived in this country for a long time, he said.
Im the only Sri Lankan Jew, the only Sri Lankan guy who also has an Israeli passport.

CCC releases note to industries  on trade liberalisation
The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) released a document containing recommendations on helping Sri Lankas industries prepare for trade liberalization.
The policy brief titled, Building Resilience, Supporting Growth: Preparing the Domestic Private Sector for Trade Liberalization, provides insights on how to consider the types of firms, as well as types of impacts, in a wide-ranging liberalisation effort, and puts forward 11 specific suggestions on support measures.
Speaking on the release of this document, the Chief Economist of the CCC Anushka Wijesinha noted, at a meeting last year, the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade met representatives of the private sector and indicated the Governments plans to embark on an ambitious trade liberalization effort. Chambers were invited to suggest measures that can be put in place to help domestic businesses adjust to meet the challenges and opportunities of this process.
While specific proposals on support measures can only be developed once the specific scope of the liberalization exercise was made clear (products, sectors, and so on) the CCC formulated a note containing the overarching framework the government should consider, and submitted initial recommendations on what support measures can be deployed.
This document has now been published for wider dissemination, with the aim of stimulating discussion, as well as action, on the next steps.It is available for download on the CCC website www.chamber.lk.

Check your balance!
Today Consultant ENT Surgeon Dr. Seetha Arambepola talks to T n C Healthwatch about Vertigo, a common disease among people.
Q - Define Vertigo.
A - Vertigo is an illusion of the movements. Due to this condition, the patient feels unbalanced or the environment around him rotating. Symptoms could vary from light headedness to full blown spinning attacks, vomiting or ear related problems.
Mainly Vertigo affects our balance system. Balance relies on our eyes, inner era, brain and the lower limb joints. Any type of insult to the inner ear or any related part can cause vertigo.
Causes of vertigo can vary. Mainly it is divided into two as ear related causes and brain related causes. Low sugar level in blood (hypoglycemia) and heart problems too can cause vertigo. Brain related causes such as cerebral tumors (cancers) bleeding to the brain etc are very rare. Inner ear related vertigo is very common.
Q - How is vertigo diagnosed
A - If vertigo does not settle with medicines, the doctor will recommend a MRI scan. But the diagnosis is mainly based on the details provided by the patient such as duration, onset, associated symptoms such as vomiting and ear problems.
The doctor examines the patient properly and decides the cause. If necessary, the doctor will order an audiology testing and Brain MRI.
Q - What is the treatment process
A - Different Vertigo types need different treatment. Sometimes hospitalization and injections are required. Medicines, ear surgery too may be required according to the condition. Sometimes the issue settles with the different methods of exercises (epleys manure) prescribed by the doctor.
Q - How can it be cured
A - If you are suffering from Vertigo for a long period, you should consult a doctor and get it diagnosed properly. Home remedies should not be applied without proper diagnosis because vertigo can be caused due to various other reasons as well.
Intake of salt should be limited and excessive salt intake should not be done especially if a person is suffering from menieres disease. Aggressive head movements should be avoided.

China has already launched seven pilot regional carbon trading markets since 2013 in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangdong, Shenzhen, Hubei and Chongqing. They cover a range of heavy industrial sectors.
As of Dec 31, the cumulative trading volume in the seven pilot markets reached 160 million tons, worth nearly 2.5 billion yuan, according to a report by the China Beijing Environment Exchange and the Beijing Emission Trading Association.
China plans to expand the pilot program nationwide later this year.
Last year, authorities including the National Development and Reform Commission made preparations for the launch, including mobilization, quota allocation, and legislative preparation. - BBC

China, Sri Lanka bondage: 60-year-long unparalleled collaboration
On February 7, a historical day dawned for Sri Lanka. The Embassy of Sri Lanka in Beijing and the Embassy of the Peoples Republic of China in Colombo were opened on February 7, 1957.
Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai visited Sri Lanka on January 31, 1957 and met Sri Lankan Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike on February 7, 1957 and laid the foundation of the bilateral diplomatic relationship. During the past 60 years, the relationship has grown very much.
Whatever administration came into power in Colombo, they did not waive their Chinese connection. Chinese unshakable political stand for the Governments of Sri Lanka during the past 60 years too has been unique.
The global policy of the Peoples Republic of China on inter-state relations has always been on five noble principles of the peaceful co-existence. China supports Sri Lanka on these principles; mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non aggression, non interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual co-operation, and peaceful co-existence of both countries.
China objected several occasions at the UN Security Council when Western imperialist interfered in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka.
During the prolonged war against terrorism, while many powerful countries overtly and covertly supported the LTTE, China openly stood by Sri Lanka. The victory against separatists in 2009 was possible because of Chinese unshakable support towards Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka too have contributed to the Peoples Republic of China and China always appreciate Sri Lanka in this regard.
On January 6, 1950, Sri Lanka supported China as the 13th country to recognise the new Peoples Republic as an independent and sovereign state. When China was economically isolated and blocked by the Western imperialists and their puppets, Sri Lanka went ahead to sign the famous Rubber-Rice Pact with China in 1952. While Chinas legitimate position in the United Nations was blocked by the USA and its allies, while Taiwan was illegally placed in the UNO, Sri Lanka upheld the One China Policy and insisted that the Peoples Republic should be unconditionally placed in the UNO General Assembly and the Security Council.
The Anniversary of 60-year-old diplomatic relations scheduled for this February is not just another event. It strengthens almost all fields of bilateral necessities and would definitely reach a nonparallel position through implementing the Maritime Silk Road International Project. The proposal is expected to flourish during the next decade as the next golden chapter of Sri Lanka-China diplomatic relationship.

CIM Sri Lanka heralds 2017 with Talking Point series on Marketing Insights
The Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) Sri Lanka held its inaugural Talking Point Programme for the New Year titled Insights for Marketing in 2017 in January at the Union Ballroom, Hilton Colombo Residences.
With an aim to appraise participants on the marketing trends of 2016 and navigating through what is forecast for 2017, the vibrant panel also discussed maintaining best practices and ways in which to support a companys future strategic direction.
The event brought together corporate leaders, professionals and marketers, presenting insights on how marketing has evolved in 2016 and the unique challenges shaping 2017.
The panel consisted of Roshani Fernando, COO, Quantum Consumer Solutions, Shiran Fernando, Lead Economist and Senior Product Head Frontier Research, Himalee Madurasinghe, Chief Executive LMRB, and Erosha Tennakoon, Director at MindShare, Group M. The panel discussion was moderated by Makshoodh Meerasaibu, Marketing Director, Home Care, Foods/Refreshment & Pureit, Unilever Sri Lanka.
Presenting an overview of the Sri Lankan economy, Shiran Fernando discussed the Macro Insights for 2017 with a detailed outlook on interest rates and currency trends while identifying key factors to watch out for during the new year.
The last two years there shows some stability and assurance in the markets. There are many key reasons to be positive and at the end of 2017 the economy could be much better, he noted. However, Fernando cautioned the need to be prepared for external risks which could derail stability and to expect some domestic bumps.
Addressing those present, Roshani Fernando explained on Insights from a psychographic lens of the Sri Lankan Household which described five different psychographic profiles that exist across Sri Lankan households. She presented valuable qualitative information in understanding the countrys divergent households and keys to unlock opportunities to look at consumers differently.
Himalee Madurasinghe, outlined insights on Emerging patterns of Consumer behaviour and Lifestyles. Citing a wealth of data from branded products over three decades and numerous surveys she explained how the household income has shifted over time and doubled from 2009-2016.
Madursinghe emphasized on a series of opportunities for marketers in terms of durable goods due to lifestyle changes and increase in income in addition to the blurring lines between urban and rural.
Changing consumer demographic and lifestyles have contributed to the growth of many sectors, where convenience options have increased. While urban and especially rural consumers now make very informed decisions, the need for two price tiers for the emerging segments due to market changes has arisen, she opined.
Erosha Tennakoon, Director at MindShare, Group M Ltd spoke on Emerging trends in the media and communication landscape in Sri Lanka. She noted, The consumer today is complex and demanding with many needs and wants portraying dynamic behavior. Communication should be personalized and interactive through adaptive methods.
She urged marketers to seek integrated communication plans as they are a marriage of traditional and new media showcasing better results rather than using the streams in isolation.
A vibrant interactive discussion that followed the sessions presented the audience with further discerning thoughts in understanding and connecting with consumers in new and meaningful ways, in the current evolving and dynamic business environment.
The Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) UK is the world's largest professional body for marketing. CIM Sri Lanka is the first international branch of CIM UK comprising the largest number of members, both students and professional members. The regional institute has always campaigned for greater recognition and excellence in the marketing profession in Sri Lanka, through education, training, and professional development.

Citizen-oriented civil engagement
It was reported recently that the Auditors Generals Department is planning to implement a Citizen Participatory Audit to enhance the performance, efficiency and effectiveness of the public-sector service. According to the news report, this audit system will assess the services provided by local government bodies to their constituents. An audit report will be released thereafter, based on the feedback received from the residents and other individuals who seek the services. This is a good step as a starting point. However, this writer believes we have to move further, in keeping with the trends of the other developing countries, and implement a Citizen Participatory Audit in a broader context.
The reason is obvious. With the development of democracy, citizen awareness of Government activity has increased and citizens have come forward to demand more rights as taxpayers. They express their demands through many different types of civic groups, commonly referred to as civil society.
Civic groups are exerting a huge influence on the government. They not only monitor various government activities but also intervene in government decision making. Government can no longer remain unilaterally supplier-oriented, ignoring the wishes of citizens: they must inevitably make public services consumer-oriented and responsive to the citizen needs expressed by civil society.
Participation
During the past three decades, civic groups have begun to make requests that experts in a wide range of areas of civil society be allowed to participate in the Auditor Generals audit activities. Direct participation, of course, may threaten the Auditor Generals independence, and such issue should be approached with due caution and prudence. The Auditor General should maintain independence and neutrality in relation to both auditees and all outside influences.
Indirect participation  meaning, citizen experts participation in audit planning as advisorsis highly recommended as it raises the Auditor Generals level of expertise, which may not be otherwise sufficient. Citizens wishes and complaints, which may not be fully grasped by the State audit agency, can also be conveyed appropriately through this channel.
On one hand, a key role of audit is to take a critical view of and monitor government activities from a third-party perspective. On the other hand, the activities of civil society may include criticizing/ monitoring government operations and directly participating in various government activities to achieve citizens objectives. Thus, the two are interrelated and similar.
It is in this context that many developed and developing countries are beginning to implement the citizen participatory audit in a broader sense. In such a setting, citizens (civil society, academic groups, community members, private sector) and the Auditor General work together to audit the processes of delivering public services and government programmes. As a result, transparency and accountability in the way government performs its functions is enhanced. This innovative civil society and Auditor General practices are adopted in a number of countries, including India, Mexico, South Korea, Argentina, South Africa, and the Philippines.
Contribution
This development is nothing new. Over the last three decades, the capacity of civil society organisations to understand, analyse, and influence public expenditure has grown dramatically. In many developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, non-governmental organisations (NGO), think tanks, community and grassroots organisations have been involved in the growing movement to make public expenditure more transparent and accountable.
Civil society organisations engaged in audit-focused work can contribute to public expenditure management in several ways. First, they provide critical and independent information on the impact of the expenditure on poor and low-income citizens. Second, they can help build budget literacy among citizens and facilitate discussions and debates on budgetary issues within civil society. Third, they can collate and disseminate information on public finances.
They also can provide training on public finances to citizen groups and the media, thereby strengthening the capacity of all of these groups to exercise oversight over public expenditure process and to demand accountability from government agencies. This writer believes that greater collaboration between Auditor General and civil society organisations could lead to stronger expenditure oversight by the public sector as well as civil society. This activity would facilitate strengthening the countrys good governance framework.
In rural Rajasthan, the largest state in India, an organisation called the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) has, developed into one of Indias most potent social justice movements. The organisation is a union of peasants and workers and has successfully demonstrated the power of information as an effective tool to enable citizens to participate in governance. The MKSS uses innovative forums called public hearings - also called social audits - to facilitate structured and focused discussions among residents on government expenditures of public development funds in their communities.
MKSS-sponsored public hearings have had a significant impact in limiting corruption in public works projects in rural Rajasthan. The success of MKSS social audits has even influenced the state government of Rajasthan to introduce aspects of social auditing within local governance processes. The state government now requires that a social audit be held annually within each village; as part of this process, all village residents must be given an opportunity to vote on a resolution verifying that the projects in their village have been successfully completed. While this process has its limitations, it represents a radical change in the institutional space provided to citizens to audit public funds.
In South Africa, the Public Service Accountability Monitor (PSAM) was established as an independent research project at Rhodes University in 1999. It initially took on the task of tracking actions taken by the provincial administration in response to reported cases of corruption. Over time, PSAM began to shift its focus to the structural context of weak financial management that was responsible for many of these acts of corruption and maladministration. It began to systematically monitor the compliance of provincial administrative agencies with public finance regulations and administrative directives. This included creating a database of information of strategic planning within agencies and their annual and audit reports.
PSAM has achieved encouraging results in spite of working in a hostile political environment. Its research and advocacy efforts have contributed to the improvement of financial reporting standards in provincial government agencies In the Philippines, an organisation called The Concerned Citizens of Abra for Good Governance investigate corruption in government projects, such as the use of substandard materials and fraud in contracting procedures. It submits the findings to the national government.
Another civic organisation - Procurement Watch Inc. - in the Philippines successfully pressured the government into reforming procurement laws. It now conducts activities with the Ombudsman, government departments involved in procurement. They use their networks to add political weight to audit institution recommendations. These are only few of the success stories.
Modalities
There are three modalities of collaboration between Auditor General and Civil Society Organisations:
(1) Civil Society Organisations can conduct independent audits. In a number of countries, including India and Mexico, they have developed successfully innovative social auditing processes that are independent of formal government audit processes.
(2) Civil Society Organisations can use audit findings produced by Auditor General to hold government agencies accountable: For example, South Africa's PSAM publicizes findings from government audit reports in press releases and radio talk shows. PSAM also publishes a scorecard measuring the comparative compliance of various provincial agencies with public finance laws - these scorecards draw in part on the findings of official audit reports.
(3) Civil Society Organisations can work closely with Auditor General: Concerned Citizens of Abra for Good Government ((CCAGG) in the Philippines participated as a member of a government audit team undertaking performance audits of the public highways agency, for example.
Civil Society Organisations are the natural partner of the Auditor General, as they can play a critical role in building pressure on the system to improve overall public financial management based on the audit recommendations. In this way, Civil Society Organisations help promote accountability and transparency. Further, based on the degree of collaboration, Civil Society Organisations can provide input during the planning, execution and reporting phase of the audit process.

[CITIZENS' Mail - (20-02-2017)
HEALING OURSELVES AND A NATION
The two hardest lessons I have had to learn in life are these:
 I cant change other people, I can change only myself
 If there is something wrong, it is wrong with me
These principles come from the opinions of people from all walks of life and on our need as a nation to take stock of ourselves and arrive at some new goals.
A shared sense of direction and a determination to excel to achieve these goals must be more that material prosperity. It would have to grow out of a set of shared basic values or ethical principles.
It is comforting to know that throughout our society there are men and women who are gravely concerned about the direction in which this nation is going, or not going.
Which is all very good and plausible, as long as we all realise that it is up to every one of us personally and individually to make better place to position itself among social and economic excellence.
It cannot be done by any of us trying to tell others what they should or shouldnt be doing. It can be done only if enough of us are prepared to do the right things for ourselves and for others in our homes, our workplace and our community.
It cannot be done by any of us blaming any others of us for the conditions we find ourselves in. We have to come to understand that we are all personally responsible for who and what we are and that if we dont like it, only we can change it.
If we believe we can change things by telling others what they should or shouldnt be doing, we havent been watching whats being happening in the world for centuries. Thats what you get for trying to tell others how they should live  anger, resentment, bitterness, frustration and, in the end, alienation.
And as for blaming others for our situation, people in general have been blaming the government and the weather for just about everything since only God knows when and more recently political correctness has instilled in many of us the victim mentality that tells us that someone or something else is to blame for anything and everything that happens to us that we dont like. Where has that got us It has created among us a large group of people who spend their lives in anger, resentment, bitterness, frustration and, ultimately, alienation, which breeds broken marriages, fatherless children, venereal disease, child abuse, violence, disrespect for others or their property, overfilled jails, declining economic output and an even widening gap between the haves and the have nots.
So, whats to be done in order that we might right the ship and get all of us sailing in the right direction The answer is simple: if enough of us are prepared personally to live the sort of lives that are attractive to others, in less than a generation we will have repaired much of the damage that has been done.
If we set standards for ourselves personally and do what we can to live up to them, others will be encouraged to do the same. So, let us be real people  faults and all. Let us make changes in ourselves and therefore the betterment of ourselves and others.

Conte keeps feet on ground as Chelsea edge closer to double
LONDON, Saturday - Chelsea manager Antonio Conte paid tribute to the performances of his back-up players as his in-form team moved a step closer to a league and cup double.
The Italian made seven changes for Saturday's FA Cup fifth-round tie at second-tier Wolverhampton Wanderers, which the Premier League leaders won 2-0 thanks to second-half goals from Pedro and Diego Costa. With Chelsea eight points clear in the Premier League and with at least two sides from outside the top flight having reached the FA Cup quarter-finals, the Londoners chances of a second domestic trophy double in seven years look good. Conte said it was too early to be thinking about the double, although he acknowledged to reporters his team were doing a great job in both competitions.
But after this game it is important to understand that nothing is easy, he said. It will be very difficult to win both competitions, but we want to try to win some trophies. With 13 league games remaining -- including matches against both Manchester City and Manchester United -- Conte knows he will need positive contributions from all his squad. He was pleased with the performances of those he called up for the tricky encounter with Wolves, including Cesc Fabregas and former captain John Terry, who have become fringe players under the former Italy head coach.
Dont forget today I made seven changes and I trust in my squad and my players, he said. It's important that when I put them in the starting 11 that I have a good reply from my players who are not playing a lot. Today they give me great answers.
It is not easy when you dont play a lot, and John and Cesc and all the players showed me they have good form. It means they are good professionals. It is great to have these type of players in my squad because I can count on them.

The National IT Conference (NITC) of Sri Lanka will be held from September 11 to 15 in Colombo, in partnership with the SEARCC Conference2017. The theme of the forthcoming conference will be Towards Digital Prosperity. Under this apt theme, the conference will focus its deliberations on eight specific tracks  CIO Perspective, Digital Inclusion, e-X (e-Healthcare, e-Education, e-Tourism, e-Services), Digital Media and Broadcasting, IOT & IOE, Mobile Apps, Digital Security and FinTech.
This theme is quite relevant as in the current context in Sri Lanka as well as elsewhere, there is growing interest and vibrant discussion on how digital infrastructure, digital systems and digital economy can help people at large. The Computer Society of Sri Lanka is eager to explore these possibilities for the betterment of people worldwide.
It is customary for SEARCC (South East Asian Regional Computer Confederation -http://www.searcc.org) to organize a conference in a selected country in the region every year. Sri Lanka was given the opportunity to host the 2017 conference, which will run parallel to the IFIP (International Federation for Information Processing) General Assembly. Participation at the forthcoming event is expected to be encouraging with the IFIP General Assembly anticipating a strong delegation of its members to visit Sri Lanka for the parley.
In terms of feedback, 60+ foreign individuals are due to attend the General Assembly from nearly 50 countries. In addition, the SEARCC Conference, SEARCC Executive Committee meeting and associated meetings will bring over 20 top notch IT leaders from the South East Asian Region, including Australia, Papua New Guinea, Malaysia, India and Taiwan.
IFIP General Assembly, SEARCC Conference and National IT Conference have created a unique international, regional and national blend. IFIP is the leading multinational organization in ICT recognized by the United Nations and other world bodies. IFIP has the representation of ICT Societies from 56 countries/regions, covering five continents with a total membership of over half a million. It links more than 3,500 scientists from Academia and Industry. (http://ifip.org)
The National IT Conference is Sri Lankas largest, as well as the national event in the ICT industry. The CSSL (Computer Society of Sri Lanka) has organized this confab for the past 34 years consecutively. This year (2017) marks the hosting of the 35th successive conference. By partnering with two other regional and international organizations, the NITC will be staged on a very strong and broad platform. The CSSL was optimistic that this experience will enrich Sri Lankas ICT professionals and the industry as a whole.
The CSSL has now sought invited speakers from amongst IFIP General Assembly participants to address its National IT Conference. This will help the organizers to use these participants as a source of speakers to disseminate knowledge to the industry.
The CSSL expects many of its speakers this year to be international speakers.
CSSL President, Yasas Vishuddhi Abeywickrama said: An event of this magnitude with such broad international participation has not been held in Sri Lanka in the recent past in relation to the ICT sector. So, we truly believe that this is a golden opportunity for the ICT industry and the country at large.

Cup shocks
LONDON, Saturday - Lincoln City produced a huge FA Cup shock to beat top-flight Burnley 1-0 away and become the first minor league club to reach the quarter-finals for 103 years on Saturday.
On a day of fifth-round toil for the top-flight sides, English champions Leicester City's problems continued to mount as they went down 1-0 at third-tier Millwall, who played most of the second half with 10 men.
Chelsea, chasing a league and FA Cup double, restored some order with goals from Pedro and Diego earning them a 2-0 win at Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers, but Manchester City were held to a 0-0 draw at Huddersfield Town.
Middlesbrough quelled a stirring comeback by third-tier Oxford United to win 3-2 at the Riverside Stadium.
The magic of the Cup will continue on Monday when Lincoln's National League (fifth-tier) rivals Sutton United host Arsenal. Holders Manchester United face Blackburn Rovers on Sunday after Tottenham Hotspur go to London rivals Fulham.
Millwall's third win over Premier League opposition this season, secured by Shaun Cummings's 90th-minute goal at the New Den, would ordinarily have topped the shocks.
But they were outdone by Lincoln.
Sean Raggett's headed goal in the 90th minute continued the dream run of the National League leaders who easily matched a side 81 places higher up the English football ladder and who held Premier League leaders Chelsea to a draw a week ago.
It's a football miracle for a non-league team to be in the last eight, Lincoln's young manager Danny Cowley said.
We are realists. I will never ask the players to do something they're not capable of. But we thought if we could get the game plan right we could compete. Burnley had lost only three of their previous 29 home matches in all competitions but failed to make their perceived superiority show in a scrappy game.
Just when it seemed Burnley had gained the upper hand Lincoln were awarded a corner and Raggett rose above a crowd of players to head the ball over the line despite keeper Tom Heaton's attempt to claw it out.
Lincoln, only the third minor league side to beat top-flight opposition in nearly 30 years, are now just one win away from a semi-final at Wembley Stadium.
Burnley, meanwhile, were the fall guys again, having been beaten by minor league Wimbledon in 1975 when they were also a top-flight side. My team were nowhere near the level they can show, manager Sean Dyche said.
Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri made 10 changes for his side's trip to south London Millwall -- his eyes fixed on the his side's relegation battle and a looming Champions League last-16 tie against Spanish club Sevilla.
Millwall had Jake Cooper sent off in the 52nd minute for a second booking but even a numerical advantage failed to stir a Leicester side who suffered a sucker punch when Cummings was played in by Lee Gregory and fired past Ron-Robert Zieler.
When it was 10 versus 11 they played better than us with more desire and heart and deserved to win, said Ranieri, whose side have lost five consecutive league games.
Chris Maguire and Toni Martinez scored within a minute of each other to haul Oxford level at Middlesbrough but their hopes of emulating Lincoln and Millwall were ended four minutes from time when Cristhian Stuani tapped in Boro's winner.
Promotion-chasing Huddersfield enjoyed a record crowd of 24,000 at their John Smith's Stadium as they matched Guardiola's City. A clean sheet against Manchester City makes our chest bigger, Huddersfield boss David Wagner said.  Agencies

The fourth session of the Colombo Big Data Meetup was held at VirtusaPolaris recently, where industry professionals discussed the latest findings in Big Data tools and technologies.
SamudraKanankearachchi, Software Architect/Data Science Specialist 99X Technology, presented on the topic, Forecasting Seasonal Effects in Business Data (Time Series Modeling) Using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio.
He discussed the extensive use of forecasting in business to make predictions about demand, capacity, budgets and revenue. Starting with an introduction to Time Series Modeling and walking through a few use cases, he then discussed the technical aspects of Time Series Modeling.
In the next session, Dinesh Priyankara, Microsoft MVP, Founder/Principal Architect at dinesQL, discussed the topic, Processing data using Apache Hive.
He discussed how previously ignored data has suddenly become the most important part of the business, and how it needs to be processed similar to how we process standard, relational data, which is called BigData, unstructured data or semi-structured data. In addition, he discussed how initially it was a big challenge for engineers because processing data with unfamiliar languages was not easy but the introduction of Apache Hive, which provides a SQL-like interface, changed that. He also talked about Apache Hive and how it assists in processing Big Data.
The meetup was moderated by Dinesh Asanka, Microsoft MVP and Senior Architect at VirtusaPolaris.The Colombo Big Data Meetup, held every quarter, gives those interested in the field the opportunity to interact and discuss how the latest research and findings can influence real life problems and thus create solutions.

DCSL pays Rs. 500 bn in taxes - Harry
Competitors dont show true accountsThe Distilleries Corporation (DCSL) has paid over Rs. 500 billion as taxes to the government and are still making profits said Chairman, Harry Jayawardena.
Speaking at their 25th anniversary celebrations of DCSL he said in addition they had paid over US Dollars 90 million as dividend so far. He said that today there are 25 other players in the industry and most of them say they are not making profit.
Their books dont show profits and this is surprising as we dont produce the total requirement of Sri Lanka liquor consumption!
The government sold 60% of State Distilleries Corporation on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 1992. A consortium of investors formed by Milford Exports Ceylon Limited, Lanka Milk Foods (CWE) Limited (both companies controlled by Harry Jayawardena) together with Smith New Court Investors from Singapore purchased them.
Jayawardena said that State Distilleries Corporation not making profits at that time was surprising. I cannot believe this since the corporation held a monopoly in the country during that time. No company can lose when they hold a monopoly.
After he took over the company it started making profits and it is even so, up to now.
We have shown how to turn around companies and this is because of good management and discipline
After less than two decades of privatisation, DCSL has become a conglomerate with diversified interests in many areas of the countrys economy.
In 1995, the company entered into a joint venture with Pernod Ricard of France, one of the top 5 liquor producers in the world, to incorporate Periceyl Limited to produce whiskeys, brandies, and other international liquor in Sri Lanka for the Sri Lankan market. Also in 1995 the company acquired the century old Beruwala Distillery Limited.
The current market capitalization of DCSL Plc is over Rs. 82 billion as at date.
Jayawardane said that the company doesnt have a single Trade Union.
There is no need to have one since workers do their job and the management pays them well and looks after them.
In 2016 through a share swap Melstacorp Limited became the holding company of the group making DCSL a subsidiary of the former.
Politicians and governments should do their job while workers too do their part and this is the recipe of our success.
We dont do politics in office and we also dont want politicians to interfere with our work.

Hamilton: A polished Quinton de Kock half century laid the foundation for South Africas four wicket win over New Zealand in a tense finish to a rain-shortened opening one-day international in Hamilton on Sunday. In a clash that went down to the wire, it was a man-of-the-match performance from de Kock on a wicket that took an exceptional amount of spin in New Zealand conditions.The departure of de Kock for 69 sparked a middle order collapse as even the New Zealand quicks turned to bowling cutters on the responsive pitch before an AB de Villiers rescue mission saw his side home with a ball to spare.
We never expected it to turn like that in Hamilton, de Villiers said.
From past experience this becomes a really good batting track in the evening but that was far from it.
With the fixture reduced to 34 overs a side following heavy rain early in the day, New Zealand posted 207 for seven, boosted by a whirlwind 51 off 23 balls at the end by unbeaten pair Colin de Grandhomme and Tim Southee. AFP

Eat less, say goodbye to wrinkles
Put down those expensive face creams. Theres a much cheaper way of fighting wrinkles - but its definitely not the easiest.
Eating less helps to combat the effects of ageing and protect against grey hair and stiff bones, new research suggests.
And the benefits of restricting calories can be applied all over the body - potentially allowing people to live for longer, scientists claim.
Eating less helps to combat the effects of ageing and protect against grey hair and stiff bones, according to scientists
Researchers from Brigham Young University observed two groups of mice to test the effects of calorie consumption.
One group were given unlimited access to food while the other was restricted to consume 35 per cent fewer calories.
In terms of humans, this would be the equivalent of an adult man cutting down from 2,400 advised calories a day to 1,560. The average woman would go from 2,000 to a mere 1,300.
Calorie consumption
The calorie-restricted mice were more energetic and suffered fewer diseases, the study published in Molecular & Cellular Proteomics found.
Study author Professor John Price said: When you restrict calorie consumption, theres almost a linear increase in lifespan.
We inferred that the restriction caused real biochemical changes that slowed down the rate of aging.
The benefits of restricting calories can be applied all over the body - potentially allowing people to live for longer, experts claim.
And its not just that theyre living longer, but because theyre better at maintaining their bodies, theyre younger for longer as well.
They discovered that ageing occurs at a cellular level as eating less causes ribosomes - the cells protein makers - to slow down.
But when they are halted, the bodys natural ageing process suffers from a slight delay too.
The decreased speed lowers production of proteins, but gives ribosomes extra time to repair themselves.
This allows the skin cells to keep functioning well, according to study author Professor John Price.
He said: The ribosome is a very complex machine, sort of like your car, and it periodically needs maintenance to replace the parts that wear out the fastest.
When tires wear out, you dont throw the whole car away and buy new ones. Its cheaper to replace the tires.
But Professor Price warned that people shouldnt start counting calories and expect to stay young forever.
Educated decisions
However, the research could help scientists to make more educated decisions about what food is best to eat.
Calorie counting has been widely documented as a method of losing weight, but research in June suggested it may be a waste of time.
A diet, packed with good fats such as those in olive oil, saw people lose slightly more weight than those who strictly controlled their calories.
The findings, from the University of Barcelona, fueled an ongoing row about three-decade old guidelines that say eating too much fat is linked to obesity and cardiovascular disease.

THE BENEFITS OFCUTTING CALORIES
A drastic diet to cut your daily calories by a fifth could ward off cancer and diabetes.
Scientists found it is possible to turn back the clock and live longer using extreme dieting in middle age.
In monkeys, stopping them from eating between 5pm and 8am extended their lives by 10 per cent, compared to eating normally.
University of Wisconsin researchers said the findings that dieting can fight ageing will also apply to humans, who share 93 per cent of the same genes.

Eleven drown in boat tragedy
At least 11 persons were drowned and seven went missing after a boat carrying a group of people capsized in the sea off the Katukurunda coast yesterday morning.
Disaster Management Centre Director General L S Senadheera told the Daily News yesterday noon that 29 persons, who were rescued, were admitted to Kalutara and Beruwala hospitals, and the condition of two of them was critical.
A boat carrying around 40 persons including children had departed from Beruwala to Kalutara to attend a Church feast.
About 7 to 8 fishing boats had departed to attend this event.
None of the people who were in those boats had been wearing life jackets. As one boat capsized, the other boats had returned rescuing some of the people. We have information that some of the people were entangled in the fishing nets which were in the boat.
We cannot keep hopes about their lives, but a special operation has been launched to turn the boat into position. Two vessels were sent for this purpose and a helicopter has been deployed for search operations. So far we recovered 11 bodies, he said. Altogether, 21 boats had departed from Beruwala carrying a large number of people to attend the religious event.
The boat named Mayura Putha which capsized had been the largest among the fleet and it had carried only passengers sans any fishing gear.
It is said that the boat had been overloaded and the boatman had brushed aside suggestions to unload some of the passengers.
First, the devotees had gone to St. Lazaruss Church and was then heading towards the Holy Cross Church in Kalutara when the tragedy occurred.
It had been about 50 km from the shore at the time.
The Navy and the Air Force had launched a search operation to rescue the missing.
Meanwhile, the Police have launched an investigation into the incident.

Farmer community will not be affected: Finance Minister
No room will be left to affect the farmer community due to the decrease of duty on imported rice varieties, says Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. He pointed out that the responsibility of the government is to protect the consumer on one hand, while on the other hand to safeguard the farming community.
The minister expressed these views at a ceremony held to lay the foundation stone for a Dharmasalawa at Sri Kalyani Gangarama Temple in Mattakkuliya yesterday (February 19th). The Dharmasalawa will be built from the personal wealth of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake at a cost of Rs. 25 million.
Speaking at the gathering, Minister Karunanayake said that serving the people without bias is the duty of true politicians. He said it is natural to target such politicians by the corruption taking place in the country when they attempt to fulfill the aspirations of the people. The minister also said that such baseless accusations would give more courage in the forward march towards serving the people.
The Finance Minister further expressed his views in this manner:
Various factions make allegations that the cost of living has gone up. But as members of a government which abides by its policy to practice what is preached, we should say clearly that the prices of essential commodities are lesser than to that of the prices that prevailed in the market before January 8, 2015. Prices of 25 essential commodities were dropped under the 100 day programme of the Good Governance. Except rice prices, prices of all other goods are still unchanged, he said.
We removed the duty on imported rice.
Accordingly, the dispute on the rice issue was brought to a minimal level. We are ready to take stern legal action against unscrupulous traders who attempt to sell rice at exorbitant prices, he further said.
President Maithripala Sirisena is a leader who has a good awareness about agriculture. We took action to control the price of rice on the guidance of the President. At the same time, we should mention that no room would be left to affect the farmer community by the dropping of duty on imported rice.
Simultaneously, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been winning the international community today and is trying to strengthen the future of the country. We will be able to make a new change in the country in the near future, the minister said.
Chief Incumbent of the Sri Kalyani Gangaramaya Ven. Kudaheelle Rathana thera, Ms. Mela Karunanayake and former Municipal Councillor Chaminda Aluthgedara and several others participated in the event.

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera directed officials to bring forward proposals and projects to further develop Cey-Nor as a profit earning public entity.
The Minister made the request at a progress review meeting regarding the resturant, Cey-Nor, situated in Colombo.
At the meeting the Minister said that in the past five years, Cey-Nor has lost a significant amount of profit due to management shortcomings.
The Cey-Nor storage complex and the boat yard in Mattakkuliya was leased to a private company under a low monthly rent of Rs 100,000.
This incurred a huge loss to the institute and therefore it was agreed to lease Cey-Nor to another company which agreed to pay Rs 1,000,000 per month, earning a huge annual profit.
Cey-Nor was previously leased to a private company five years ago for a monthly rent of Rs 150,000.
However, its higher management told the Minister that another company is willing to pay a monthly rent of Rs 1.6 million for this restaurant.

Friction between political authorities and public servants, unhealthy - President
Frictions between politicians and public officials are not healthy for the countrys progress. In the march towards prosperity, all must work unitedly and obligingly, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
There is no goodwill, understanding, and cooperation among various sections of public service. There is no unit, he said.
He was addressing a seminar for Southern Province public officials held under the theme Role and Challenges of the Public Sector in Creating Poverty Free, Empowered Sri Lanka at the Weligama Urban Council auditorium, recently.
In the implementation of policies and government programmes, there are conflicts among parties of the public sector, he pointed out.
However, our public officials are ready to shoulder responsibility and perform any duty for the people. Our government officials have worked honestly during difficult times and come out of tough situations.
Public officials should not be blamed entirely for trivial slip-ups committed by some government officials. If we introduce proper development plans for the country, public officials will be ready to fulfill their objectives. We must work honestly and be determined to realize national goals. We have to develop our self-esteem and courage, he said.
Mass media has a pronounced responsibility in the countrys journey towards economic, social and political prosperity, President Sirisena said.
At present, our media, both electronic and print, have embarked on a destructive media culture. A majority of news coverage on almost all television channels try to draw a gloomy picture about the country. In their news bulletins, they try to imply that the country is completely destroyed. They carry negative information about the country and the people. The print media also follow suit. According to media operators, they occupy in harmful practices to improve their ratings, the President said.
At a time the entire country is in an arduous march toward prosperity, the media has to encourage such worthy moves. They should not carry misleading information. Mass media should encourage the development moves of the country, he pointed out.
Dr Sunil Jayantha Navarathne, Southern Province Governor Dr. Hemakumara Nanayakkara and Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva also spoke.

Get over the blame game
The current text must be scrutinized, analyzed, understood and realized in the context of the initial understanding components of the Part One, published in Daily News on February 15, 2017. Not doing so may lead to misunderstanding and misinterpreting the contents, even to the extent of falling in to the extreme of branding the present writer, an anti-Buddhist. This will be even more so, with the proponents of the vested interest of extremism and religious fundamentalism, since, the actual and ultimate objective of the current analysis is the intelligent and fruitful guarding of the Sinhala Buddhist and the Buddhism as well. That is what the extremists do not want.
Besides, what is suggested is to intelligently protect the Sinhala Buddhist and the Doctrine of the Buddha, in the spirit peace and friendship, without blaming and attacking the Muslims. Hence, any attack on or negative and shallow branding of the current writer, shall be tantamount to, advocating the promotion of extremism and fundamentalism in this beautiful country. Read further and know the truth.
Peace-loving and friendly Muslims
Muslims are a friendly community. Their religion Islam promotes peace. Their community friendship and religious peace are inseverably linked. It, in fact, is the personal experience of the current writer, from the times of his university education abroad, since, the Faculty of International Law he studied, along with other community-graduates, was a pool of Islamic Muslims, stemmed virtually from almost all Middle-East countries. They, not only were pious, but also had the wish and potential to be open, transparent and flexible.
This is not to say that every day is springtime with Muslims. There are crises. The crises are exploding, not from the peace-loving and friendship-rooted Muslim majority, but from a handful, due to ignorance or not knowing, engaged in the extremism of non-original Islamic fundamentalism. Non-original, since, Islam is a peace and friendship fostering religion.
The psychology of extremism does not allow the peace-loving Muslims to live in friendship with other communities. In their extremism, they use the artificially created, Islamic fundamentalism and abuse the freedom of the majority Muslim community, to bend their minds to create a fundamentalist Islamic caliphate in this beautiful country. Herein, they also exploit the device of the fear of God, the reward of God to those, who obey them and the curse of God to those, who disobey them.
The majority peace-admiring Muslims have been rendered choiceless, in defending themselves, against this so-called religious quagmire. On the top of all the above mechanism, what is further nourished with by extremism is, the concepts of betrayer and betrayal. This is why, the Muslim majority is silent. Their opposition to extremism is not discernibly vocal. Now, the BBS has a duty.
Community duty
Hence, it is the responsibility of the peace-loving Sinhala-Buddhist community to save their Muslim brothers and sisters, their beautiful children, from the extremism of fundamentalism. Yet, the lamentational blamology is not the right path. And, this is what the Bodu Bala Sena must comprehend. It seems that the BBS agenda demands couple of crucial measures, for it to be self-revolutionized. The BBS action plan must not be strangled in to stagnation. It has to contain a sweet fragrance, in order to maintain its magnetism, to retain its freshness and it should evolve like life itself.
It is indisputable that the extremism of religious fundamentalism should be fought with. Nevertheless, in this battle, the majority Muslim participation is a sine qua non. With their empirical and voluntary involvement, the war against extremism will be not only easy, but also result-oriented. Result-oriented, not only internally, but also internationally. Besides, the global circumstances have become favourable to battle against fundamentalism. Particularly, the governance of US, with its new and courageous leadership, with Donald Trump at its head, has absorbed an orientation, heard never before.
The majority of powerful countries with Arabic origin have come to the forefront, taking the lead to oppose the extremism. These historico-developmental phases, matured unto their qualitative peaks are not to be belittled or under-estimated, yet, to be intelligently assimilated and applied in the resolution of crises Sri Lanka is conflicting with, be they communal, religious or otherwise. Dear Dilanthe, the BBS agenda has to change, transform and transcend.
Blame classification
The present writer intends to indicate only central blame categories, though the blame type numbers continue to increase day by day. Among them are: (1) Demographic blames, (2) Religious blames, (3) Terrorism blame (4) The blame of brutal religious laws, (5) The blame of dress-code, (6) The Sinhala Buddhist identity distortion blame, (7) Archeological remains destruction blame and many more. Nevertheless, herein, the emphasis to be focused upon has been decided to be the demographic blame.
There are some Sinhala Buddhists, who clamour that Muslims increase their population and try to capture the land that originally belonged to Hela Diva.
It is true that there was a time, there were no Muslims in Sri Lanka. Then, at a certain point of time, along with their intermittent migration, Muslims began to immigrate in to this country. First they visited as tourists. Then they came as traders. At that time our kings and Buddhist monks not only had no objection, they welcomed those Muslims, gifting their Sinhala Buddhist women to marry and produce children. Muslims not only produced children, but also converted the Sinhala Buddhist women in to Islam. Thus, this is not a new thing and Sinhala Buddhists themselves are responsible for this. It is true that the number of Muslim heads have increased unto such proportions that a Muslim could become the Chairman of the Colombo Municipal Council and simultaneously, they have also become a powerful political factor with the potential to change governing regimes. Here blaming Muslims is useless. They are right in what they do, as far as, their power, welfare and prosperity are concerned. Muslim woman
Just look at the wonderful Muslim women. They are perfect in the right understanding of their social duty. When a Muslim woman walks along the road, what can be noticed are as follows: 1. Well-dressed, covering their feminine body and concealing the attraction-curves of contours, 2. Three or four children accompany them, 3. She does not look at others and head is bent downwards, 4. Her arms hold one child, 5. Her womb contains another child. What a wondrous and powerful scene to be seen!
Sinhala woman
Now, lets glance at the Sinhala-Buddhist woman. The total opposite: 1. Scantily attired, exhibiting certain body parts in half or in full 2. Physical contours are well pressed and manifest, 3. The head is not bent downwards, 4. For the most part no children or maximum two children 5. The womb is flat.
Right here, the Bodu Bala Sena has a tremendous duty. That is, to advise and admonish those, who blame Muslims, for their population-increase-efficiency and to explain the futility of such efforts. The blame and blaming would not stop the Muslim population increase. The other way round, it will engender a Sinhala Buddhist Phobia and the concentration would be on the maximum growth of the Muslim population.
BBS duty
Hence, the BBS has a gigantic duty. That is to take all steps to power the minds of Sinhala Buddhist men and women, with a psychological propensity to increase the production of children, who are the real foundation of power and prosperity of any nation. In the execution of this colossal task, at first, the BBs has to analyze and apprehend the impediments and barriers, which impedes its way. Fundamentally, the obstacles are two types: (1) Social (2) Religious.
Social barrier-NGOs
The social barriers comprise the non-governmental organisations(NGOs), funded by foreign agencies of vested interest, propagating and promoting the ideology of family planning, branding the planned family of childlessness, as a so-called Golden Family and as the basis of economic prosperity.
The hired employees of such NGOs, go from house to house, meet the community family members and explain the value of planning the child births and if conceived, the need of aborting or in truth, killing the conceived children, yet, innocent and unborn and living in the wombs of Sinhala Buddhist and Tamil mothers. They not only coax them in to this totally anti-Buddhist brutality, but also grant them monetary gifts and various financial supports, to win their hearts in to the heinous crime. Yet, their so-called Golden Family, having been successfully operative for more than four decades, has utterly failed to produce any economic prosperity whatsoever, except for raw slaughtering of our Sinhala-Buddhist and Tamil innocent children.
Here, the Muslim women are not and cannot be trapped in, since, they are courageous enough, not to be befooled in to the sin of destroying their real community power, the children. Therefore, the BBS can structure an empirically operative schedule, to get rid of such child chopping NGOs from this majestic land of the Buddha, whose first precept along the path of purification is Thou Shall not Kill.
Religious barrier-meditation on repulsion
The religious impediments that contradict the Sinhala-Buddhist population growth vary and consist of different aspects of Buddhist Teaching. Among them, the Doctrine of Nirvana, Impermanence, Suffering, Non-self, Renunciation, Celibacy and many others. Yet, the present writers intension is to limit himself unto the meditation on the repulsion of the body or Pilikul Bhavana alone. The Body Repulsion Meditation is not only an excellent, but also an indisputable teaching of absolute truth. Yet, it is applicable only in relation to those, gone from home to homelessness. The lay man cannot dwell in it. Why It elucidates: (1) The body is a bundle of flesh, (2) It is indisposed, gets soiled and reaches the decrepitude, ending in death, (3) When it dies, it becomes blue, gets swollen and will be full of stinking blood and yellow pus, (4) The worms would form and roll round in it, being disgusting to look at.
Now, if and when, young men and women are indoctrinated in to this ideology, what will happen In the beautiful physical body of any girl of youthfulness, a young boy, with oozing out energies would visualize a bundle of stinking flesh, contaminated with oozing out pus and blemished with rolling round abhorrent worms. Who will produce children Who can produce children With no children, can there be Buddhists Without Buddhists can the Buddhism last
Hence, the first and the foremost duty of BBS is to comprehend the gravity of this burning issue and do all the needful to remove the barriers, which intervene, obstruct and prevent the growth of Sinhala Buddhist population, along with establishing a fund to financially assist the poor families, which produce more than two children.
Though there are many other aspects to be looked into, that, the increase of the number of the heads of Sinhala Buddhists is the most reliable path to castrate the tentacles of extremism and religious fundamentalism. Is it not much profit-generating than attacking Muslims

A grave injustice for English Literature
The other day, I had to peruse through A/L English Literature past question papers to guess what questions our learned professors would set for the forthcoming August examination , 2017 for the above subject bearing the subject number 73. Since they have prepared question papers for six years consecutively, they might find it not easy to set appropriate questions for the next. An in-depth analysis of the pattern of question papers shows that they have indirectly expected from the candidates the same answers several times.
It has been the old wine in new bottles. The increased number of passes at the second and third attempts bears ample testimony in this regard. Yet, in my opinion, they have failed to test some of the vital areas of the syllabus including poetry, drama, short stories and fiction. They seemed to have skipped very important aspects for testing.
The examinations are necessary evils. Yet, they have come to stay as no any other alternative has surpassed them yet. My concern here is not to bring forth any of that sort, but to focus your attention to an unpardonable crime the relevant authorities have committed in one of the question papers that they have prepared. These days almost all the question papers are not immune to errors. These errors have not been pointed out by most of the teachers due to visible and invisible reasons.
Private practice
Quite understandably they are not competent enough to write to the newspapers to show them, on one hand and on the other hand, they are fully involved in the lucrative business of private practice as present day disciples of Hipocrates. They have no time to bother about defective question papers. It is reliably learnt that some very reckless teachers throw away even the teachers guide and teach whatever comes to their mouth. The huge number of failures at the last examination would ring alarming bells to the sensitive authorities.
Unseen is a major question in the A/L English Literature question paper and it carries 20 marks. The allocated marks to this particular question could decide the destiny of the candidates since all of them are sitting for a very decisive examination. They are competing for a seat at the university with a set target. It is heard that some are seeking to pursue law, some others foreign affairs while some others merely want to read for English as a subject. All are high academic pursuits. Therefore, the authorities are duty bound to leave no stone unturned to bring justice to all the candidates irrespective of their milieu.
International school students
The bone of contention is that all are alike at examinations. No favouritism is allowed. In our country, two syllabi are in function, as far as I am aware of, namely the local syllabus and the EDEXEL. The latter is meant for the international school students who mostly come from the affluent families, I mean the moneyed. In this sense, if the authorities pick up a poem from the EDEXCEL syllabus for the unseen question in the G.C.E A/L ENGLISH LITERATURE question paper it is a gross injustice to the candidates who appear for the same examination with those students who had studied the same poem for their Grade 10.
EDEXCEL INTERNATIONAL GCSE in English literature. The case in point is that some students study for their GCSE at the international schools and sit for A/L Eng. Lit at a government school. The disadvantage for the students who follow the local syllabus is unimaginable. I would like to focus your attention to the particular question of the relevant examination. It is as follows,
The year: 2015 -The unseen poem - Poem at Thirty Nine
EDEXCEL syllabus: GSCE -section C Grade 10-Poem at Thirty Nine
The die is cast. The situation is palpable.
As a parent, I would like to know what has to be done in a situation like this.
What redress could be offered to the victimized party.
What has gone wrong or had it been done on purpose with a sinister aim.
So many particulars, so many questions.

Gunaratne fireworks win T20 series for Sri Lanka
Geelong: Asela Gunaratne slammed a pulse-racing 84 to power Sri Lanka to a last-ball victory against Australia on Sunday, clinching their Twenty20 series.
Gunaratne pounded the Australian bowlers with five sixes and six fours off 46 balls to get his side home by two wickets to scenes of wild jubilation at Geelong.
It was the second time the Sri Lankans had denied Australia victory off the last ball, with Chamara Kapugedera hammering a boundary to win Fridays opening match in Melbourne.
The Sri Lankans remain unbeaten in five T20Is in Australia, but this was their finest come-from-behind performance in front of their excited expatriate fans.
With four overs left Sri Lanka needed 52 to win but an undaunted Gunaratne tore into the Australian attack, slamming Moises Henriques for three consecutive sixes and a four and then taking two fours and a six off Andrew Tyes final over.
The bashful Gunaratne only offered a few words -- It is a very happy moment -- before dashing away from his post-match man-of-the-match presentation.
Aselas was an amazing innings. We lost too many wickets early but Asela finished the game for us, skipper Upul Tharanga said.
Winning in Australia is a huge achievement. This is Aselas first tour to Australia and we are happy.
Australias captain Aaron Finch paid tribute to Gunaratnes dynamic innings.
When youve got an in-form batter in, it is tough. That was one hell of an innings, Finch said.
I thought the way we bowled in the middle was outstanding. When you have a good player in good form, they hurt you.
Sri Lanka played very well there. Take nothing away from them. We have been on the receiving end again. The series is gone, hopefully we can salvage something in Adelaide.
The series may be decided but there is one match to play, in Adelaide on Wednesday, with the Sri Lankans eyeing a clean sweep.
Their triumph in Australia follows a 2-1 T20 series victory over South Africa last month.
The Australians could not believe what they were seeing after having the tourists struggling on 40 for five in the fifth over and going nowhere fast. But Gunaratne, who bludgeoned 52 off 37 balls in the first game in Melbourne, hit out spectacularly while Kapugedera chipped in with a run-a-ball 32. Henriques earlier hit his first T20 international half-century to steer Australia to 173 after they were sent in to bat. The big-hitting all-rounder was left unbeaten on 56 from 37 balls when the last wicket fell off the final ball.
Veteran Nuwan Kulasekara captured three wickets in the final over to keep the dangerous Henriques away from the strike and restrict the Australia score. He finished with four for 31 from four overs. Australia began strongly, with Michael Klinger slamming 43 off 37 balls and the promoted Ben Dunk 32 off only 14 balls.
Dilshan Munaweeras one over cost 22 runs, with Dunk clouting him for three sixes and a four. Sri Lanka did not help their cause with a few dropped catches. Kapugedera put down Henriques when he was on 19.
But Milinda Siriwardana took a superb diving catch at long-off to dismiss Ashton Turner for seven. Australia made two changes, with fast bowler Jhye Richardson making his debut and Dunk called in to bolster the top order.
Fast bowler Billy Stanlake was dropped along with the legspinner Adam Zampa.
Sri Lanka made one change to the team that won in Melbourne on Friday, bringing in batsman Kusal Mendis at the expense of left-arm wrist-spinner Lakshan Sandakan. AFP
President congratulates cricket team
President Maithripala Sirisena has congratulated the Sri Lankan cricket team who recorded a stunning victory against host Australia at Geelong yesterday to take a winning 2-0 lead in the three-match T20 series.
President Sirisena made a telephone call soon after the victory and conveyed his special wishes to man of the match Asela Gunaratne who gallantly steered the team to victory with a sparkling batting performance.
He also wished the Sri Lanka Cricket management.

Horses tale
Of all the stories in Susanna Forrests book The Age of the Horse: An equine journey through human history, the vignette that, perhaps, lingers most in the memory takes only a page or two to tell. Yet in many ways it defines the infinitely complex relationship that exists between man and the genus Equus. It involves mankinds continuing attempts to domesticate one of the breeds of pure wild horse, the Tarpan, once common in the Ukraine. By the 1870s, Tarpan numbers had dwindled almost to the point of no return when a lone mare was spotted by the herdsmen on the Rachmanov Steppe, coming closer and closer to their herd of domestic horses, presumably for company. The mare mated with the herds stallion and went on to bear two foals. One day she followed them into a landowners stable. His men, realizing her value, rushed in to separate her from the other horses, and the ensuing fight was so brutal that she lost an eye.
Elusive apparition
She raged, according to Forrest, trying to climb out of the box they shut her in, striking at them whenever they came near. Locked into the stable, she settled enough to give birth to a third foal, but when the spring came and the horses were let loose to graze, she fled, leaving her foal behind. In the autumn she was seen again by the local horsemen  an elusive apparition, appearing and disappearing in the surrounding landscape. Deciding to test their horses against her they set out to capture her, driving her from one horseman and mount to the next  but she outran them all, until, leaping a snowbank she stumbled in a hidden runnel, and broke a leg. They hauled her on a sleigh to the local village, where they planned to make a false leg for her, but she died some days later  the last of the known pure Tarpans. In that story lies the kind of emotive kernel that has drawn millions of readers  and not only horse-loving ones  to books such as Black Beauty, My Friend Flicka and The Silver Brumby, albeit without the happy ending that fiction writers can bestow on their equine characters.
Forrest has carved out an unusual place for herself as a chronicler of all things equine. Last year, she won the Sophie Coe Prize for food writing for her essay Horsemeat is Certainly Delicious: Anxiety, xenophobia and rationalism at a nineteenth-century American hippophagic banquet, which traces evolving attitudes to eating horse from neolithic Europe and Asia to twentieth-century New York; she is also the author of If Wishes Were Horses: A memoir of equine obsession (2012). In the latest book she brings her eye for detail and story-telling abilities to an extensively researched, fascinating history, covering subjects as diverse as the increasing popularity of equine therapy programmes, the return to horse-powered farming in some American communities, the Tahki of Mongolia and their highly prized speedy ponies, and the particularities of breeding Shire horses. Perhaps because of the ground the book attempts to cover, things get off to a slightly shaky start. There is a staccato quality to the sentences and a somewhat stilted edge to the prose in the first few chapters, as though the author were struggling to find her stride. But as the book progresses, Forrests passionate interest in her subject engages and we readily follow her as she travels to America, and through much of mainland Europe, Britain and China.
Forrest has spent time with many people who have sought to understand how a horse thinks, including Lucy Rees, the author of the classic The Horses Mind (1984). Rees left her job as a neurophysiologist because she was disturbed by the medical stance on animal experimentation.
She moved from London to live in the mountains of North Wales and, after her own experiences with horses, which included rehabilitating a neurotic Lipizzaner stallion into a calm trail-riding horse, Rees became fascinated with wild horses. She was surprised to discover that, rather than the hierarchical structure generally understood to be operating in any herd, horse groups in fact work under three rules: cohesion, space and synchrony. The interview with Rees is one of the highlights of the book  it illustrated what I have observed myself over decades of riding, rescuing, breeding and starting horses  that horses, if allowed, travel and graze in a constant ebb and flow; there is a hardly perceptible collective orchestration to their movements that we dont notice until we look closely.
A no doubt connected fact, according to Rees, is that, to a horse, company is essential. A lonely horse, concludes Forrest, and all sentient horse owners will concur, is an unhappy horse; and as the story of the last known Tarpan shows, a solitary horse will seek its place among others of its kind. Forrest traverses the written history of the horse, dove-tailing it neatly with her physical travels in the modern-day horse world.
In America, she was surprised to find that, in part thanks to the Amish and their insistence on traditional farming methods, British heavy horses such as the Suffolk Punch are as much in demand there as they are in decline in the UK. At a Horse Progress Day in Holmes County, Ohio, she meets a farmer, Jason Rutledge, who exclusively uses heavy horses for his farming needs.
Fossil fuel
Its disrespectful to throw away thousands of years of expertise for seventy-five years of fossil fuel, Rutledge says. I dont work with horses because I want to go back to the past, Im doing it because we must preserve this as a valid tool in the toolbox of humanity for the future. Rutledge, Forrest discovers, is far from alone.
There are small communities throughout the US committed to a sustainable, organic and solar-powered future in which the horse has a permanent and vital role.
Also in the US she spends time with battle-scarred veterans at a centre where horses are used to help returned soldiers to overcome PTSD  and, at the other end of the spectrum, she visits China to witness the growth of the luxury horse market for the very wealthy, where horses live in air-conditioned stables with piped music.
Endless possibilities
We learn, too, of circus trick riders and the eighteenth-century theatrical spectaculars known as carrousels, as Forrest takes us through the seemingly endless possibilities of horsehuman relationships. She does not, however, shy away from the darker aspects of the horse industry, confronting the vexed question of horse abattoirs in the US (the enforced closure of all but a few has simply meant that thousands of horses a day are trucked across the border to Canada), and the European horsemeat scandal of 2013. The question left hanging is, in a sense, unanswerable  what is a horses life worth
Perhaps I am showing an Antipodean sensibility, but the books title seems somewhat misleading: it suggests an all-encompassing account that the volume surely cannot pretend to deliver a journey through human history when horse-proud countries such as Australia and New Zealand, Iceland, Dubai, Finland and Ireland, to name but a few, are missing from the story.
The contributions of Australia and New Zealand to the First World War in horseflesh alone is staggering. 136,000 Walers  so-called because, although the horses came from all parts of Australia, they were originally sold through New South Wales  were sent to join the war effort; they were sturdy, hardy horses, able to travel long distances in hot weather with little water. One horse made it back to Australia  Sandy, the personal mount of Major General Sir William Bridges, who died at Gallipoli. At the end of the war, 13,000 horses were surplus to needs; of those, 11,000 were sent as remounts  mainly to the British army in India  and the others were destroyed.
The ANZAC mounted division formed in Egypt in 1916, and of the 18,000 horses New Zealand contributed, four returned home. In the end, of course, an author has to make choices about what to include, and what to leave out, and Susanna Forrest rightly talks about the work as an unmapped territory of branching carriles that intersected in impossible complexity. She would, she decided, trace her own paths among them, and her passion for the horse leaps from the pages of a book that is a rich fount of knowledge for anyone interested in the innumerable and endlessly fascinating points where horse and human meet.

Japanese embassy opens new Visa application centre
The Japanese Embassy in Sri Lanka opened its new Visa application centre in Kollupitiya recently.
It is operated by the VFS Global, the international outsourcing and technology services specialist for diplomatic missions and governments.
Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Kenichi Suganuma opened the new office located at 4 1/1, Geethanjali Place, Colombo 3. Application drop-off facilities will also be in operation in nine outstation cities to increase accessibility of visa services for residents.
Ambassador Suganuma speaking at the opening ceremony said: it is my sincere hope that, with the opening of the new Visa application centre, visit to Japan will become more convenient for travelers from Sri Lanka to Japan.
Suganuma added: in recent years, the number of people traveling between Japan and Sri Lanka has increased, resulting in over 20,000 visa applications being submitted to the Embassy for the first time in 2016. This figure is triple the number of applications that was received five years ago. With the launch of Japan visa application centres in Colombo and Jaffna, we aim to cater to the increasing volume of visa applications, by reducing the waiting time and offering extended hours for submissions, as well as outreaching to nine major cities outside of Colombo for application, which will ensure greater accessibility and convenience to applicants.
VFS Global Middle East and South Asia COO Vinay Malhotra said: "with the opening of the Japan Visa Application Centre in Colombo, travellers to Japan will now get their visas processed through our professionally managed services. We are confident that these centres will positively contribute to the strong ties of travel between the two countries, by maintaining best-in-class standards of service quality for applicants.
With the launch, visa applications will no longer be accepted at the Embassy of Japan in Colombo.
The visa application drop-off centres will act as collection and distribution centres for visa applications and processed passports. All applications are forwarded to the main processing centre in Colombo from these locations. Applications can be submitted at the VFS Global Visa Application Centre in Jaffna, or at any of the Aramex drop-off centres in Kandy, Kurunegala, Galle, Puttalam, Katunayake, Peliyagoda, Biyagama and Ratmalana.
Daisuke Kobayashi, Senior Director and Taiga Uezono and Director of the Japan National Tourism Organization Singapore Office participated.

Johnson takes Riviera lead, closes in on top world ranking
PACIFIC PALISADES, Saturday - Long-hitting Dustin Johnson closed in on the world number one ranking when he took the second-round lead at the weather-plagued Genesis Open on Saturday.
Johnson overcame some errant iron shots mid-round, storming home with three birdies in the final four holes for a five-under-par 66 on the damp and unusually lush Riviera course.
The U.S. Open champion posted a 10-under 132 halfway total in the event formerly known as the Los Angeles Open, one stroke better than fellow Americans Pat Perez (66) and Cameron Tringale (64).
Venezuelan Jhonattan Vegas trailed by three shots along with Americans Patrick Rodgers and J.T. Poston, with former world number one Luke Donald of England among a group another stroke back.
The second round was completed nearly 24 hours behind schedule, a result of Fridays near washout as a major winter storm lashed southern California with torrential rain and strong winds.
Seventy-one players made the cut, which fell at even par, before the third round started late afternoon, though the leaders will not tee off until Sunday morning.
Officials still hope to complete the scheduled 72 holes by late Sunday, which should be do-able given the decent forecast.
World number three Johnson will jump to top spot if he wins on Sunday, as long as current number one Jason Day finishes lower than third.
Australian Day faces a tall order to do so, eight strokes off the halfway pace in a tie for 40th.
Johnson is feeling at home on a course where he twice has finished runner-up.
Im very comfortable, he told Golf Channel. Ive had a lot of good finishes so it gives me a lot of confidence going into the last two rounds.
His approach game went off the boil mid-round but he used a deft short touch, assisted by the soft conditions, to keep his card blemish-free.
I hit a few squirrelly shots, he admitted. I drove it well all day. I just hit some poor iron shots in the middle of the round. Didnt make any of my short (putts) but made a few long ones.
Those long ones included a 35-footer at the 15th and a 20-footer at the last.
Tringale, meanwhile, finished in style, slam-dunking an 80-yard wedge shot to birdie the last and keep the heat on Johnson.
Perez also closed well with birdies at the final two holes. World number five Hideki Matsuyama of Japan, who also started the week with a chance of becoming number one, missed his first cut since August, shooting 80 for six-over 148.  Agencies

JVP rejects amended LG polls system
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday rejected the proposed amendments to the local government electoral system stating that it doesnt properly address the Peoples wishes.
JVP leader Anura Dissanayake addressing the media in Colombo said new system could affect the chances of the JVP at future elections.
He said no one could justify trying to sideline a political party using a flawed electoral system.
This new proposed system will not only hurt the JVP, but it will badly hurt the cherished objective of the countrys voting system  representative democracy, he said.
The JVP leader said the percentage ratio proposed to elect members through proportionate and first past the post system would not confirm the democratic rights of the masses.
Under the new system a party which wins a local authority with 51 percent of the vote will obtain 77 percent of the seats. And the party which obtains 49 percent and loses the local body will only receive 23 percent of the seats, he said.
He also noted a lot of grey areas are in the proposed system and urged the government to hold the LG polls under the present system if authorities cannot come up with a system to address the the peoples wishes. The proposed amendments to the local government electoral system are intended to end the current preferential voting system to elect members to local government bodies. The new system is a mixture of the proportional representation system and first past the post system, he said.

Keiko Kobayashi returns to conduct the Sosl
Dynamic and inspiring Japanese conductor Keiko Kobayashi returns to Sri Lanka to conduct the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka's "Virtuosi in Concert" on March 15, 2017. Staged at the Ladies' College Hall at 7.30pm, this concert will also feature three other internationally renowned musicians, Shani Diluka (Piano), Gabriel Le Magadure (Violin) and Valentin Erben (Cello) performing Beethoven's Triple Concerto.
ARTE extols Shani's skills as "Shani Diluka, her brilliant personality, and her capability of squeezing out the music to its last essence, is rare and beautiful". Born to Sri Lankan parents, Shani lives in Monaco. This will be her first performance with the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka.
Ebne Quartet violinist Gabriel Le Magadure is widely recognized by international critics as an outstanding musician full of sensitivity, with a warm, deep sound and an exceptional capacity to listen.
Valentin Erben, an Austrian Cellist, was a former member of the prestigious Lucern Festival Orchestra conducted by Claudio Abbado. He was also the co-founder of the international string quartet, Alban Berg Quartet, which performed for almost 40 years.
The audience will be in for a special treat as these musicians take the stage under the baton of Keiko Kobayashi. Keiko has contributed significantly to music in Sri Lanka through her work with the Colombo Wind Orchestra and the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka.
Since 2007 Keiko has conducted the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka on numerous occasions to appreciative audiences. Her energetic and enthusiastic style of conducting demands continuously ascending standards of performance by the musicians and through the years she has successfully conducted the SOSL in many outstanding concerts.
Keiko, who has studied conducting under leading Japanese conductors including Seiji Ozawa, is currently the Permanent Conductor of the Tokyo Wind Symphony Orchestra, which is the first professional wind symphony orchestra in Japan.
She is also the Chief Conductor of the Japan Wind Ensemble and a conductor of the Soai Orchestra. She shares her conducting skills by lecturing at SenzokuGakuen College of Music.

Keith Noyahr abduction : Two more arrested
The Police yesterday arrested two more suspects in connection with the 2008 abduction, assault and false imprisonment of senior journalist Keith Noyahr.
The Police said the two suspects were Corporals of the Army and they had been arrested by a special team from the CID in the wee hours of yesterday.
The Police said the arrested suspects were currently under interrogation and they would also be produced before the Mount Lavinia Magistrate Courts later in the day. Last Friday, the Police arrested three Sri Lanka Army personnel in connection with the Keith Noyahr abduction and assault.
They had been remanded till March 3 after being produced before Mount Lavinia Acting Magistrate Rathna Gamage. Noyahr had been abducted on May 11, 2008 by unknown persons. Releasing a statement following the incident, the publishing company where Noyahr worked claimed the abduction followed a series of threats against Noyahr.He was known for his critical analyses of Sri Lankas security situation during the war in his column which he wrote under a pseudonym.
Though the Police set up three investigation teams, the arrests have come after nine years into the incident despite protests and calls by journalists for severe action against the perpetrators.
