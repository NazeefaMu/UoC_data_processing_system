Djokovic confirms split with Becker
BERLIN: World number two Novak Djokovic confirmed on Tuesday he has split from his coach Boris Becker after three years working together.
Boris Becker and I have jointly decided to end our cooperation, Djokovic, who won this years Australian and French Open titles, wrote on his official Facebook page.
The Serb has won 12 Grand Slam titles in his career -- six while working with Germanys Becker -- twice in Australia (2015, 2016) and Wimbledon (2014, 2015) and the French (2016) and US Open (2016) once.
The goals we set when we started working together have been completely fulfilled, and I want to thank him for the cooperation, teamwork, dedication and commitment, said the 29-year-old Djokovic.
On the other hand, my professional plans are now directed primarily to maintain a good level of play, and also to make a good schedule and new goals for the next season.
In this regard I will make all future decisions.
Becker, now 49 and who won six Grand Slams himself, reacted on Twitter by posting a photo of himself and Djokovic celebrating this years French Open title, saying: Thank U ! We had the time of our life ...#teamdjokovic. After his Paris triumph in June, Djokovic had a complicated second half of the season, losing the world number one ranking he had held for 122 weeks from July 7, 2014 to Britains Andy Murray in November.
Djokovic also lost his Wimbledon and US Open titles and was eliminated in the first round of the Rio Olympics by eventual champion Juan Martin Del Potro of Argentina. Djokovic had made a change to his coaching team towards the end of the 2016 season with Spaniard Pepe Imaz joining him for the Paris Masters, where the record four-time champion fell in the quarter-finals, and the World Tour Finals in London where he lost to Murray.

Fifty years ago when cyclist Trevor won a bronze medal in Asian Games
The Sri Lankans Cycling fans along with Trevor de Silva will be celebrating 50 year old Sri Lanka sporting record. On the 17th of December 1966 former Sebastianite and Old Josephian Trevor de Silva won a Bronze Medal at the Asian Games in Bangkok. It was the very first occasion that a Sri Lankan won a medal in the Asian Games and since then a Sri Lankan Cyclist has never ever won an International Cycling Medal.
There were six of Asias best and fastest cyclists with one Olympic Medalist and in the lane six was Sri Lankas Star Rider 24 year old Trevor de Silva and what was going through his mind as he was pitted against the cream of Asias cyclists. On that hot and humid day in Bangkok the Lake House reporter Carlton Senevirathna interviewed him and asked from this young man about his chances of winning a medal and his answer was full of confidence and not ignorance and he said, I have trained extremely hard for the last three years and over the last three weeks in Bangkok and also trained with the Chinese and Japanese Squads and have observed them closely and confident of winning the race.
At the start of the first lap it was a disaster for Trevor and the cyclists were moving in excess of 50 km per hour when a touch of wheels center rider in front of him crashing to the ground and whose cycle bounced up in the air and hit Trevor. The impact threw him off his bike injuring his hand and broke his collar bone and to the amazement of the crowd Trevor immediately picked himself up and gave chase to win a Bronze Medal and became Sri Lankas first ever Medalist in International Cycling. If not for that unfortunate incident it was very likely that he would have won the race and a Gold for his motherland.
Fifty years to the day most Sri Lankan cyclists have not even come closer in equalling this unique record. He is not the most successful cyclist at International level but he is also the Most Celebrated Cyclist in 1967 as he was voted by the public as the Runner Up to Marathon Runner the great Lucien Rosa in the Sports Star of the Year Contest. In the year 2008 he received National Sporting Award from the Ministry of Sports at the BMICH and in 2014 he and his wife Anne were invited by the Sri Lankan Government to the grand opening of the new sports complex at the Ministry of Sports where he was awarded a Gold Medal by the former Sri Lanka President Mahinda Rajapaksa for a life time achievement.
Trevor won numerous races in the 1960s. At the age of 21 he was the first cyclist to win the three major tours in the space of twelve months. Lake House sponsored Tour de Lanka, Tour of the Hills and the Tour of the Valley. His training partners were Late Maurice Coomaravel, Desmond Gunawardena, Trevor Newman, Jeffrey Mason and his Asian Games team mates Mike Hassan and Ivon Gamage. Trevor is domiciled in England with his wife and at the age of 43 years he ran a marathon in under two hours and 40 minutes.

SLC explains new rotation policy for support staff

Sri Lanka Cricket clarified yesterday their new rotation policy that has been put in place with regard to the support staff accompanying the national cricket team on tours.
It is not that we have terminated the services of Charith Senanayake as manager of the team as some media institutions speculated but we have replaced him with Ranjith Fernando for the South African tour which is part of a new rotation policy which Sri Lanka Cricket has put in place, said Sri Lanka Cricket CEO Ashley de Silva.
As you may notice it is not only the manager that we have replaced but several other members of the support staff for the South African tour. We have a couple of other names on the pipeline for the post of managers which we dont want to reveal at this stage as we have not yet spoken to them, he said.
De Silva stated that this new policy by Sri Lanka Cricket was to ensure that support officials dont get too familiar with team players, which has happened in the past.
