Olympic champ McLeod vows to do Shanghai hurdle hero Liu proud
Shanghai, Friday: World and Olympic hurdles champion Omar McLeod wants to put on a blistering display in Shanghai on Saturday in homage to the Chinese city's athletics hero Liu Xiang.
Liu is retired but the Shanghai native remains a Chinese sports icon because his 2004 Olympic hurdles gold medal was the country's first in men's track and field.
Liu, now 34, was also a 2007 world champion, though his brilliant career petered out because of persistent injury and he retired in 2015. But Chinese spectators may see shades of Liu in McLeod during Saturday's Diamond League meeting -- the affable Jamaican certainly hopes so.
McLeod, who is chasing a third successive 110m victory in Shanghai, said on Friday: "They show a good appreciation for hurdles here and I want to go out there and show my appreciation for their appreciation of hurdles.
"Liu Xiang was one of the reasons why I got into running in the streets and race and hurdle.
"He was just an inspiration and I've heard that I hurdle just like him, so I draw a lot from him," said the 24-year-old McLeod, touted as a viable successor to Usain Bolt as the pre-eminent Jamaican athletics star. AFP

OMP begins work from Mannar today
The Office on Missing Persons (OMP) is launching a series of regional-level consultations,beginning in Mannar today, May 12, 2018.
The consultations are a vital step in the process to operationalise the functions of the OMP in its search for missing and disappeared persons, the Information Department said in a press release.
Consultations will be held with the families of missing and disappeared persons, activists,professionals and organisations working on the issue. In the coming weeks,the OMP will visit Matara, Trincomalee, Mullaitivu, Kandy, Killinochchi, Jaffna, Batticaloa and Ampara in a first phase of visits.
The purpose of these meetings will be to share the OMP's organisational plan and strategies, as they currently stand, in order to hear public views and incorporate suggestions on measures and processes.The plans thus far attempt to build on the lessons learned and recommendations from previous commissions and the Consultation Task Force or Reconciliation Mechanisms process.
The OMP understands the urgency and frustration of the families and individuals who have been searching for their loved ones over a number of years, but respectfully requests their patience to
ensure vital processes are put in place in order to ensure an effective response and to avoid, adhoc measures.
These consultations mark the start of the outreach process of the OMP and are a positive indication that the search for missing and disappeared persons is underway.

Parliament
Speaker says he needs a deputy speaker urgently
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday in Parliament, said that the need for a Deputy Speaker is felt badly to as there was nobody to assist him in his work.
The Speaker said that he had brought this matter to the attention of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Wednesday. It does not matter whether he is from the Opposition or from Government. I could work with anybody. The appointment must be done soon. I am unable to handle this work all alone, he lamented.
He pointed out that he was yet to receive an official communication from the President over the resignation of Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala. Sumathipala has sent in his resignation letter to the President.
The Speaker made these observations in reply to a Point of Order raised by UNP MP Nalin Bandara, who questioned as to why Parliament was delaying electing a new Deputy Speaker.
The Group of 16 MPs who had recently joined the Opposition, had written to the Parliament Secretary General last month, stating that they have resigned from all positions they held and left the Government. Thilanga Sumathipala had signed this letter which means that he too had resigned from the post of Deputy Speaker.
The seat has fallen vacant. Why arent we electing a new person the MP questioned.
The Speaker said a new Deputy Speaker could be elected once the President submits to Parliament the resignation letter by Sumathipala. I have officially communicated this matter to the President, he said.
UNP MP S M Marikkar charged that there were complaints that Sumathipala used his office and official vehicles for political activities.
The Speaker replied that Sumathipala has returned the office and official vehicles, adding that he was unable to trace whether those were misused in the past.
Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena pointed out Sumathipala could continue in the post even though he switched the sides. As MP S B Dissanayake previously pointed out, there had been Opposition MPs as Speakers and Deputy Speakers in the past, he added.
Mothers entitled to 84 days maternity leave
The Government presented two amendment Bills yesterday in Parliament that entitles women to 84 days of maternity leave, irrespective of the number of children they have.
As per the existing law, women with two or more children are only entitled to 42 days of maternity leave, whereas women who give birth to their first and second child receives 84 days maternity leave.
Two Amendment Bills to the Maternity Benefits Ordinance (Chapter 140) and the Shop and Office Employees (Regulation of Employment and Remuneration) Act (Chapter 129), have been presented to grant 84 days of maternity leave to every woman who gives birth to a live child.
Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathillake presented the Bills for First Reading.
Out of the 12 weeks of maternity leave, a woman could utilize two weeks leave prior to her confinement. If she had worked for any number of days during the last two weeks before her confinement, she could utilize such leave with the rest of the 10 weeks leave immediately after her confinement.
If the confinement does not result in a live child, the woman would receive 42 days of maternity leave. Out of which, she could utilize two weeks leave prior to her confinement.
Maternity leave is on a paid leave basis, given in addition to holidays and other annual leave an employee is entitled to. The Bills would be moved for debate at a future date.
Delimitation Report on PCs and National Audit Bill to be taken up on May 22, 24
Party Leaders who met in Parliament yesterday, decided to take up the Delimitation Report on Provincial Councils on May 22 and the National Audit Bill on May 24.
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena speaking to the Daily News yesterday, said the Government was waiting for a report from the Auditor General to go ahead with the Audit Bill and that was the reason the Bill was postponed yesterday.
Questioned on the elections system for Provincial Councils, he said Government leaders were yet to communicate a final decision on it to the Party Leaders. However, Party Leaders representing the Government, had met the Prime Minister on Thursday, to discuss about the Provincial Council Elections. They had told the Party Leaders that they would report back their positions within the few days.
MP Gunawardena said different views with regard to the Provincial Council Election system were expressed at the meeting by Ministers Rauf Hakeem, Mano Ganesan, MP Bimal Ratnayake and himself.
The Party Leaders had reappointed the same members to the Public Finance Committee, which stood dissolved following the prorogation of Parliament. The Committee members were reappointed so that they could clear the Audit Bill and other financial bills. The committee was previously headed by TNA MP M A Sumanthiran. Its Chairman was not named during the last party leaders meeting, he said.
He said the members for other Parliamentary Committees, including COPE and COPA, would be decided by a Selection Committee headed by the Speaker when it meets on May 17.
The issue of the Deputy Speaker post had also been discussed at the meeting and the Speaker had explained that the post could not be considered vacant until he receives an official communication from the President.
Fuel prices up due to heavy losses:Bimal
Despite the Finance Minister and Government claiming the reason for the increase in fuel prices, it had been due to the heavy losses incurred by the government, according to the documents submitted by the Petroleum Corporation to the Parliamentary Cope Committee. A litre of 92 Octane Petrol although the selling price was Rs. 117, the true cost for the whole process from the Port to the Refinery and its distribution, was only Rs. 72, said JVP  MP Bimal Ratnayake.
The Goods tax of Rs. 27, Customs tax of Rs. 12 and Aviation Services tax Rs. 5.64, Nation Building tax 86 cents and Government charges were Rs. 45.50 as taxes per litre of Petrol.
For the 95 Octane Petrol which was sold at Rs. 127 previously, the true cost is Rs. 83. Additional taxes are added as Goods tax of Rs. 27, Customs tax Rs. 12 and Aviation Services tax Rs. 5.80, Nation Building tax 97 cents and Government charges Rs. 45.77 per litre of petrol, which means 1/3rd is added as taxes, he explained.
Similarly, auto diesel, the true cost is Rs. 72, but it was sold as Rs. 95 until last Thursday. For every litre of diesel when taxes are added, Rs. 23.49 is added as Government tax. The same goes for Super Diesel. The government could have reduced the taxes they charge in order to reduce the burden on the people, but instead, they are piling the maximum burden on the people. The increase in fuel prices will invariably be transferred onto every other commodity, heavily burdening the ordinary people who are already finding it difficult to survive, he said, adding that it was a very unfair move by the government, where they are taxing the people without reducing the number of ministers and saving on costs.
Joining the Second Reading of the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill, MP Bimal Ratnayake, said the biggest issue facing the workers at the BIA was the disparity in wages between the top management and the lower ranking workers.
However, responding to Ratnayakes remarks, Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, said there was no basis for such an allegation as the lowest wage of an Airport worker was around Rs. 70,000, while the highest officers wage was Rs. 96,000. There isnt a huge disparity between the two wages and it is certainly not correct to state that the lower ranking workers are paid very low wages. The strike was staged demanding a bonus of Rs. 100,000 in a day, which was very unreasonable, he added.
Audit Bill postponed indefinitely
The National Audit Bill which was scheduled for debate yesterday, was postponed indefinitely.
Government sources said Party Leaders who met on Wednesday decided not to take up the Audit Bill yesterday, as the Prime Minister was unavailable.
Parliament took up the Civil Aviation (Amendment) Bill instead. The debate was limited to about two hours, while the House was adjourned early as a result. Yesterdays Parliament sittings, previously scheduled to continue till 7.30pm, lasted only until 1pm.

President highlights need for river conservation
President Maithripala Sirisena stressed the importance of a comprehensive programme on river conservation, when he met the representatives of the World Bank at the Presidential Secretariat, on Thursday.
He said the river system in the country faces the challenge of erosion on shores.
President Sirisena said from the centre of the country, 103 rivers flow into the sea and Mahaweli River is the largest river. However, due to the lack of a proper programme for the conservation of rivers and the lack of a dedicated institution, Mahaweli and other rivers have been severely challenged. He said all responsible stakeholders should pay urgent attention to this.
The President appreciated the assistance provided by the World Bank for development activities in Sri Lanka.
He said the assistance provided to Sri Lanka by the World Bank is expected in the future too, as a responsible stakeholder in the development journey of Sri Lanka.
Recalling the challenges faced by Sri Lanka and other countries as a result of climate change due to global warming, the President said even though drought and floods are not a novel experience to Sri Lanka, during the past few years, the country faced a disastrous situation unlike in the past.
President Sirisena expressed gratitude for the contribution provided by various projects under World Bank funds.
He discussed the progress of the dam safety and water resources planning project under World Bank assistance and added that the World Bank's support towards new transformations in the field of water management is also expected in the future too.
President Sirisena said the government is giving priority to agriculture, irrigation and power, while the main emphasis is on renewable energy sources.
He said whatever the investments that flow in, the country has kept faith in an economy based on agriculture.
Secretary to the Mahaweli and Environment Ministry Anura Dissanayake and other officials were present.

Former Delhi pacer taught Kapil Dev the art of bringing the ball in:
Rajinder Pal dies at 80
Rajinder Pal, the man who taught Kapil Dev the art of bringing the ball in, breathed his last in Dehradun on Wednesday. Fondly known as Pali, he was 80.
Known for his uncompromising attitude, which saw him take on the administration (Delhi and District Cricket Association) on numerous occasions, former Delhi pacer Rajinder played his lone Test against England at Mumbai (then Bombay) in 1964 apart from 98 First-Class matches.
His Test debut did not make news. His fellow debutant was leg-spinner B.S. Chandrasekhar. Pali did not get a wicket while Chandra got five.
Pal debuted for Delhi against Services at Kotla in 1954 and signed off by leading Haryana against Jammu and Kashmir at Kurukshetra in 1973.
Off-spinner Sarkar Talwar, who registered his career-beat (seven for 42) in that match at Kurukshetra, recalled, Pali Sir was such a wonderful bowler. He was nippy and commanded respect from the best of the batsmen. He did not fear any opponent and was at his best when handling juniors.
He gave us love and guidance, cared for and never allowed us to spend our allowances. He would pick all the bills. I was privileged to have achieved my best under his captaincy. He had to lead the side in that match because Ravinder Chadha missed that game.
Pal may have fallen out with Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi in later years but he told this reporter graciously during an interview, My selection was at the behest of skipper Tiger (Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi). He backed me and insisted that I play at Bombay (against Mike Smith-led England) in 1964. I will remain grateful to him and (selector) Ghulam Ahmed saab for having faith in me.
His incoming ball was very special. At the insistence of Talwar, he agreed to teach Kapil, who received the news with sadness.
I can never thank Pali Sirs contribution in words. Two of my gurus (Pal and Desh Prem Azad) have gone out of my life. Palli Sir taught me in-swing in three weeks. I can never forget him. I was told by old-timers that he was one of the finest new-ball bowlers but unfortunately did not get the kind of exposure he deserved. Pal worked to make cricket popular in Dehradun, where he was settled for more than a decade now. He had also worked in vain to earn affiliation for Uttarakhand and kept himself busy with some coaching work. He will be missed.  The Hindu

Recognizing the crises of coalition unity
The political and economic crises in Sri Lanka, will certainly move into more difficult terrain from US President Donald Trumps decision to abandon the Nuclear non-proliferation agreement with Iran, to which the US was a signatory with the UK, France, Russia, China and Germany, and which has been endorsed by the United Nations. India is already considering the problems over the import of oil, of which Iran is the main supplier.
Sri Lanka will be in the midst of a crisis affecting all South Asian nations, as the Trump sanctions begin to scuttle Iran.
It was just the day before the US action against Iran and the principle of multi-lateral understandings among nations was announced, that President Maithripala Sirisena made his statement to Parliament on the crises facing Sri Lanka. If we are to overcome the challenges faced by the country, the power struggle between the two main parties in the coalition government must cease. The competition for power between the Opposition and the ruling party must also cease, said President Maithripala Sirisena, addressing Parliament at the opening of its new session this week.
President Sirisena, who is both the Head of State and leader of the unity coalition, said the record of governance of the past three years showed the country lacking in the political and social maturity needed to realize the objectives of coalition government, causing a power struggle that had driven the people to despair.
This is certainly an interesting analysis of current political realities, coming from the highest seat in the State and Legislature, giving it the feel of a diagnosis by an unrelated observer. However, it must be understood as more of a self-confession by a participant of the very political process, in a strong leadership position in the ruling coalition; and a veiled abandonment of the politics of coalition that saw the victory of the Common Candidate in the Presidential poll in January 2015.
The observance of politics in the past three years was largely that of a power struggle between two rival parties  the UNP and the SLFP, the latter was seeking to dominate a coalition in which, it was certainly the weaker partner. Overcoming the power struggle between the two main parties of the coalition, is hardly the substance of political reality today, with divisions allowed and encouraged to spread for narrow political gains.
The competition for power between the Opposition and ruling party/parties is hardly able to cease, being the very stuff of parliamentary and electoral democracy.
While the diagnosis would largely appear to be correct, the cause of the current political disease affecting the country, is largely the departure from the core of the political organisation that brought about the unity coalition.
The campaign beginning in early 2014, building up to the heated presidential poll in November 2014, was largely intended to defeat the increasing authoritarianism of the Rajapaksa Regime, with its massive show of nepotism and corruption, and was not one to strengthen any political party. It was the search for a broader, meaningful democracy, which was being largely set aside, by the political forces built up under the Executive Presidency, brought to the country through a majority that did not vote for such a change.
SLFP leadership divide
Maithripala Sirisena, Common Candidate in the fight to defeat the Rajapaksa Regime, clinging to his links to the SLFP, and gaining the SLFP leadership as the new President of the country, was caught between two political challenges - to be the leader of the SLFP or the Common Candidate leader of a democratic state. His belief in the ability to do both, with little regard to the arising political contradictions, is largely the cause for the issues he has sought to diagnose in the speech at the opening of Parliament.
Another reality is the largely limited commitment of the coalition partner, the UNP, to think in terms of a larger unity of coalition, and not as the larger party of the alliance with its own goals of building strength for a decidedly UNP government in the future.
This comprises the stuff of the power struggle within the unity coalition, driven to inevitable rivalries between two parties somewhat different in broader economic policies and aspects of social unity, but wholly united in a lack of commitment to fight corruption and bring about an unquestionably clean government, which were the principle goals of the struggle of January 2015.
The cross-over of the 16 SLFP members to the Opposition benches in Parliament, with their loud calls for a break of the UNP-SLFP coalition, the economic and political developments that would emerge in the coming months of the shaky coalition of unity, trends in the search for a new President from 2019, and the call to abolish the Executive Presidency proposed by the JVP, will be the situations of interest and concern in the coming months.
Judicature Amendment
It certainly took a long time for the coalition of unity to see to the passage of the Judicature Amendment Bill, an important step in giving life to its pledge to fight corruption in the country. The provision to set up a permanent High Court at Bar to expedite cases of large scale fraud and major financial crimes was passed in Parliament with a majority of 67. The general line up of politics on the issue was clear in the voting, with the UNP and SLFP (in government) voting for with the TNA, and the absence of the JVP members. The Joint Opposition voted against, not surprisingly. What is of special interest is that the six of the 16 SLFP members who crossed over to the Opposition, were present in Parliament at the time and voted against the Bill.
This was a legal provision considered as important in keeping with the governments pledge to fight corruption. The JO voting against it is no surprise because several of its members are either indicted on charges of corruption, and some others are under investigation on such allegations.
The slogan of the JO has been that this legislation is part of the move by the government to take revenge on its political opponents.
The fact that this Act is now a reality is of significant importance to the political forces that campaigned and fought to ensure the election of a government with a commitment to fight corruption. The past three years have seen many delays in the legislative and judicial processes in fighting corruption, and there have also been ministerial changes due to these delays.
The new law gives power to the Permanent High Court at Bar to try a number of offences, including theft, dishonest misappropriation of property, criminal breach of trust by public servants, banker, merchant or agent and dishonestly receiving stolen property etc. Cheating, forgery, making a false document, making or possessing a counterfeit seal, plate etc, with intent to commit a forgery and offences of money laundering can also be directed to these separate courts. Bribery of judicial officers, Members of Parliament, Police officers, peace officers and other public officers has also been listed as offences that can be tried in the permanent High Court.
The voting against this Bill by the six independent SLFP members now in the Opposition is an important display of the major differences that prevail within the SLFP, especially in the context of the party leader, President Sirisenas own call of commitment to fight corruption, which was underlined in his latest speech in Parliament, too. They are clearly demonstrating their line-up with the Joint Opposition, and the lack of any accord with the principles of the unity coalition in fighting corruption, and also show their lack of support for wielding of the Presidential Sword against those who are corrupt.
The passage of this law is also of importance in the context of the new arrests made of the Chief of Staff of the Presidents Office, T. H. M. Mahanama, and Chairman of the State Timber Corporation P. Dissanayake (also a former Chief of Staff of President Kumaratungas Office) in the alleged fraud involving Rs. 20 million from an Indian investor, involving material of the Kantalai Sugar Factory.
A matter of special interest is that the position of Chief of Staff of the Presidents Office, has now been continuously linked to major fraud, with the Chief of Staff in the Office of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gamini Sedara Senerath, also indicted on an alleged major fraud involving funds for the construction of a large tourist hotel in Colombo and other related activities.
The action against Mahanama and Dissanayake also brings the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) into considerable recognition, especially in the context when it was treated with opposition by the Government, especially over the bringing to Court on allegations of corruption, persons who have a right to wear the ceremonial uniforms of the Armed Forces. That is certainly another issue the country has to face in any progress towards genuine democracy.

Royal have the edge over Zahira
The confrontation between the two school rugby teams in Royal College Colombo and Zahira College Maradana in the Singer A Division inter-Schools league rugby second round match for the 2018 season at Royal Complex in Colombo today, should turn out to be a one sided affair. The match will kick off at 4.15 pm.
Royal who thrashed Trinity College Kandy to retain the Bradby Shield last week under the coaching of dedicated and hardworking former national rugby captain Dushanth Lewke will go out as the top contenders this year to retain the inter-schools league rugby tournament this year.
The forte of the Royal College team has been their power-packed forwards. The Royal eight especially their ever green Sasitha Siyath, vice captain Maleesha Madumewan along with Himantha Hirushan, Samadhi Induwara, Fadhil Adahan, Risith Fernando and Ifam Fareed have always given a terrific display in the loose but today they will give a torrid time to the Zahira lads.
In the set scrums the Royal hooker Fareed should get the better of his vis--vis while in the line outs the Royal trio of Sasitha Siyath, Fadhil Adahan and Maleesha Madumewan will clearly out jump the Zahira duo.
With the halves combination of Nikhil De Silva and young Lehaan Gunaratne having clicked very well in the entire first round matches the Royal side will hope that Nikhil will set his three quarters in motion at every turn as they have two hard running centres in Janindu Dilshan and Thulaib Hassan..
In addition they also have two experienced wingers in skipper Shabith Feroze and Yasis Rashmika who have stood out with their powerful runs down the flank with full back Dulan Gunawardena often joining the line to form the overlap.
Zahira will have to be at their very best if they are to at least make a match of it against the formidable Royal College team in their home grounds as to date Read Avenue boys looks like an invincible team and hard to beat.
Going by the two teams starting line ups and the performance so far in the ongoing league tournament, Royal will go out favourites in todays game.

Samurdhi Bank to be made state rural bank
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will look to develop the Samurdhi Bank further into a state rural bank for the benefit of the public.
At a discussion held at Temple Trees yesterday, the Prime Minister directed his Ministry Secretary to compile a special report with recommendations to improve the Samurdhi bank and the Samurdhi programme.
A committee headed by Secretary K.D.S. Ruwanchandra had been appointed for this purpose and will also include Treasury Deputy Secretary A.R.Deshapriya and Sri Lanka Central Bank Deputy Governor K.D.Ranasinghe.
Several complaints have been made to the government over high income earners cashing in on the Samurdhi fraudulently.
Thus the Prime Minister asked the Minister of Social Empowerment to look into these complaints and discuss with the Finance Minister on a mechanism to select the most vulnerable families for the Samurdhi.
The Samurdhi Bank has assets worth Rs.101 billion and in 2016 earned a profit of Rs 33 million while in 2017 the profits had grown to Rs.3 billion.
The Prime Minister however pointed out that based on such financial information alone, a decision on whether the bank was doing well or not could be made and that banks like Sanasa which have a lesser number of assets have earned greater profit and expanded through the construction of new buildings.
He further noted that prominence should be given to the protection of the rights of Samurdhi beneficiaries and that they had to take to example, programmes like the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh to provide such loan schemes to the poor in the process alleviating poverty in the country.
Social Empowerment Minister P. Harrison, Finance Ministry Secretary R.H.S. Samaratunga and Samurdhi Development Department officials participated in the discussion.

## Title: Singapore, natural choice for Trump-Kim Summit

Singapore, natural choice for Trump-Kim Summit
SINGAPORE: With one foot in the East and one in the West, ultra-modern and secure -- to the point of sometimes being mocked as dull -- Singapore was a natural choice for the historic first meeting between the unpredictable leaders of the US and North Korea.
The stable and squeaky-clean city-state's tropical setting will be the backdrop for the June 12 summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un -- the first between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader.
The two men threatened each other with annihilation just months ago, so the choice of a neutral venue was a matter of considerable speculation, which also touched on the Korean peninsula's Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), China and Mongolia.
But Singapore -- sometimes likened to Switzerland due to its non-aligned nature and its status as a banking hub -- is in the rare position of having diplomatic relations with both Washington and Pyongyang, plus a track record of hosting sensitive encounters.
As a neutral, and objective country with much-admired consistent foreign policy principles and a small state with no desire or capacity to harm other states and their interests, Singapore fits that bill well, said Lim Tai Wei, adjunct research fellow at the National University of Singapore's East Asia Institute.
One of the world's wealthiest countries per-capita, the island state of 5.6 million people has an advanced military, robust security infrastructure, and is considered one of the safest and least corrupt places on earth. Situated between the much larger Muslim-majority nations of Indonesia and Malaysia, Singapore has long been vigilant toward radical Islamic elements. Single-party rule since independence from Britain nearly six decades ago has kept a lid on dissent -- prompting accusations of repression -- eliminating the possibility of any summit-related protests.
A selection of first-rate hotels and other possible venues where events can be tightly controlled is also likely to have made Singapore attractive, especially to Kim, who heads one of the world's most repressive regimes and will not welcome anything unexpected.
Kim is only known to have travelled abroad for the first time this year, with visits to China and a brief sojourn across the high-security border into South Korea for a historic meeting with President Moon Jae-in in April.
In 2015, Singapore hosted a historic meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Taiwan's then-leader Ma Ying-jeou, the first between presidents of the two sides since a 1949 civil war split that led to decades of estrangement.
It also has experience hosting other leadership gatherings such as the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and stages the yearly Shangri-La Dialogue, a defence forum attended by heads of state, defence ministers and top military chiefs. This year's forum at the Shangri-La hotel comes a week before Trump-Kim, meaning Singapore will already be in high-security mode, fuelling speculation that the hotel also will host the summit.
From Trump's standpoint, business-oriented Singapore is among Washington's closest trade and security partners in Asia.
Travelling there allows Trump to avoid the DMZ, which might have appeared like home turf for Kim, while a Beijing meeting could have allowed China to exert control.
Singapore doesn't have the historical or political baggage of other possible venues, said Sarah Teo, an expert on regional security at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS).
It also will be acceptable to Beijing, North Korea's only major ally and still a strong influence over Pyongyang. Singapore has long had smooth ties with China.
A successful summit would be a huge feather in Singapore's cap, elevating its reputation for fair dealing and neutrality; but a less successful one will not take anything away from it, said a commentary piece in Singapore's The Straits Times.
Singapore and North Korea have a history -- the first law firm and fast-food restaurant in Pyongyang were set up by Singaporeans -- though relations snagged last year when Singapore severed trade ties under new UN sanctions punishing Pyongyang for its nuclear and missile programmes. - AFP

Minister of Sports Faiszer Mustapha said that there is no room for anyone working at his ministry to hold a
position in National sports bodies.
He made his remarks at a meeting with members of the Professional Sports Journalist Association at his ministry yesterday.
Im not aware of our paid staffers holding positions at national sports federations. But if it is true I will take necessary action regarding that in the coming weeks. They will have to choose one job, ministry or sports association, said Minister Mustapha
He warned that he will get tough with anyone irrespective of his or her position when dealing with fraudulent activity or corruption. I have already suspended the Director General of Sports with immediate effect after his department failed to provide adequate hostel facilities for the athletes participating in the South Asian Junior Athletic Championships. It should have been his duty to monitor that situation, the Minister said.
He further said that he will not dissolve or appoint Interim Committee unless there any financials frauds taking place.
It is because I strongly believe that appointing interim committees without democratically elected officials is a bad precedent, he said. I have to carry out the work according to the instructions of the Attorney General.
The Minister said he will not cave in or bow down to anything or anyone when tackling issues of malpractice and corruption.

Following the clash, disciplinary action had been taken only on the station master.The station masters of the Nawalapitiya Operation Unit urged railway authorities to take action against the guard, by launching this strike.
The strike launched last night without prior notice was suspended by noon yesterday after the Railways authorities agreed to redress their grievance.
Office trains from Rambukkana to Colombo were also affected as a result of the situation.Trains from Kandy and Badulla were also cancelled causing a severe hardship to commuters.

Supreme Court dismisses Udayanga's FR petition
The Supreme Court yesterday refused to grant leave to proceed with a Fundamental Rights petition filed on behalf of former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga.
He is seeking an Interim Order to recall the warrant issued for his arrest by the Colombo Fort Magistrate.
The Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Nalin Perera refused to grant leave to proceed with the petition and dismissed the petition in limine after taking into consideration the facts presented by both petitioner and respondent parties.
Udayanga Weeratunga had also challenged the freezing of his 16 bank accounts by the Financial Intelligence Unit in Sri Lanka, containing USD 2.5 million, auctioning his consignment of goods brought down by the Port Authorities since he failed to pay demmorages.
On October 20 last year, the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued a warrant written in English through the Interpol for the arrest of Udayanga Weeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack crafts for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF).
Udayanga Weeratunga had filed this petition through his mother-in-law Latha Indrani, the power of attorney holder of the petitioner.
In his petition, Udayanga Weeratunga stated that he is currently residing in Mekhanizatoriv Street Kyiv, Ukraine.
The petitioner further sought an Interim Order restraining the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank from suspending the petitioners bank accounts and continuing to suspend the bank accounts.
The petitioner stated that the seventh respondent, a Chief Inspector of the FCID had moved Magistrates Court for a warrant for the arrest of the petitioner. The petitioner sought a declaration from the Court that the Chief Inspector infringed the petitioners Fundamental Rights guaranteed in terms of Articles 11, 12(1) and 13 of the constitution.
The petitioner further said the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank has infringed his Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Constitution by the purported decision to suspend and suspension of debit transaction of the bank accounts of the petitioner in contravention of the provisions of the Financial Transaction Reporting Act No. 6 of 2006.
In his complaint to the FCID, journalist Iqbal Athas stated that he had written several articles regarding the financial irregularities that had taken place in procuring four Mig-27 aircraft at a higher price.
He told the police that these ground attack aircraft had been manufactured between 1980 and 1983. He said financial irregularities had taken place during the transaction between Sri Lank and Ukraine.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for the petitioner. Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda appeared for the Attorney General.

Temporary terminal for BIA to ease congestion
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said a temporary terminal would be constructed within six months at the Bandaranaike International Airport to ease congestion.
He said tenders for this purpose would be closed in June and the work would be completed by the end of this year.
He said the ministry also plans to construct a permanent second terminal, adding that fresh tenders would be called for it as the previous contract with JAICA had to be cancelled as its cost was 45 percent more than the engineers estimates.
The minister pointed out that the Bandaranaike International Airport has become congested with a significant increase in the number of passengers and cargo.
He also said that plans are afoot to construct a second runway at the BIA.
The minister further said that Immigration and Emigration Officers must be trained to provide a friendly service to the people at the airport, as there have been reports of a number of lapses on their part. In reply to a complaint by JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake on Wi-Fi access at the airport, the minister said steps would be taken to provide a Login password and allow passengers free Wi-Fi use.
He made these observations moving the Civil Aviation (Amendment) Bill for debate in Parliament yesterday.
The Bill makes touting of passengers within the premises of the aerodrome an offence. A person guilty of the offence is liable to a fine not exceeding Rs.25,000 or imprisonment not exceeding six months or both. Touting means canvassing with a view to arranging transport or accommodation for an incoming or outgoing passenger or loading or unloading his baggage or other articles into or from vehicles or offering any similar service for money without being duly authorized to do so.

United States torpedoes Iran nuclear deal
President Donald Trump announced on May 8 that the United States will pull out of the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPA), which he described as rotten to the core. It was signed with Iran by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - France, Great Britain, United States, China, Russia  and Germany.
Attempts by European powers France, Germany and Great Britain to influence President Trump to change his mind failed. This is likely to intensify the rift between the US and its European allies. However, it is not yet certain whether the latter would succumb to US pressure or decide to defy it. Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says the Iranian nuclear deal is not dead despite US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw.
European Union Foreign Ministers aim to reassure Tehran that the JCPA is salvageable. They have called a meeting on Monday in London for which they have invited their Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif to attend.
The European Union's diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini has said the bloc is determined to preserve the Iran nuclear deal. As long as Iran continues to implement its nuclear related commitments, as it is doing so far, the European Union will remain committed to the continued full and effective implementation of the nuclear deal, she said.
In another development which seems to reveal that Washingtons foreign policy initiatives are taken according to prescriptions written in Tel Aviv, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the deal publicly a few days ago and alleged that Iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons. The United States will also shift their Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem next week in defiance of world public opinion and international agreements under which Jerusalem has a special position as a Holy City for Jews, Muslims and Christians. Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen have also supported the United States withdrawal.
Iran rejected the charge while the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said that Iran has complied with all terms of the Accord. It has allowed the International Atomic Energy Agency to mount the most rigorous intrusive regime ever devised, an obligation on Iran that lasts until 2040.
Iran has relinquished 95% of its low-enriched uranium, placed two-thirds of its centrifuges in storage, and removed the core of its heavy water reactor, thus closing off the plutonium route to development of a bomb.
The JCPA signed in 2015 decided to lift US and international sanctions against Iran, which in turn agreed not to enrich Uranium beyond the limits stipulated in the Accord.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that Iran is ready to abide by the Accord if the other signatories (except the US) are willing to continue the Accord without the United States.
With the United States' withdrawal the possibility of increasing destabilization of the Middle Eastern region is inevitable. Oil prices are also likely to rise steeply on account of mounting insecurity and possible war with Iran.
Hezbollah triumphs in Lebanon
In Lebanese elections held after nine years on May 5, Hezbollah led by Hassan Nasrullah and its allies have secured a majority. They have won at least 67 out of a total of 128 seats in Parliament. Hezbollahs armed wing is fighting in Syria against the anti-government rebels and has strong links with both Syria and Iran. Thus the Lebanese people have distanced themselves from the West which will now face a much stronger opposition in Iran, Syria, Lebanon and Turkey together with Russia in West Asia.
Prime Minister Saad Hariris Future Movement party could secure only 21 seats. Its pro-Western policies have not gone well with the voters.
Hezbollah's allies include the Amal Movement led by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and the Christian Free Patriotic Movement founded by President Michel Aoun.
The parliamentary seats are split evenly - 64 for Christians and 64 for Muslims. These groups are also further divided among 11 religious groups. Thus any coalition government would comprise disparate elements which could sometimes generate conflicts of interest.
However, the main thing is that conservative and pro-West forces would find it more difficult to disarm Hezbollah. Israel is likely to intensify its confrontation with Hezbollah and other pro-Syrian forces in Lebanon.
Mahathir Mohamad comes back to power in Malaysia
Veteran ex-leader Mahathir Mohamad, 92, has won a historic election victory, Thursday, ending the six-decade rule of the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition.
The Opposition Alliance he leads won 115 seats obtaining an absolute majority needed in parliament to form a government.
Mahathir, who will become the world's oldest prime minister, came out of retirement to take on Prime Minister Najib Razak, who has become embroiled in massive corruption scandal surrounding state fund 1MDB.

We need to provide a proper service based on these passengers needs.We need to plan to provide improved and increased train services in the next five years based on the statistics revealed from the survey conducted.
We need to improve the rail road system. New signal systems need to be developed. New communication techniques need to be used.Technological know how need to be followed to book passenger seats and issue tickets etc for their convenience. Therefore, through this plan, we will achieve all these by 2025.
Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be providing aid amounting to US$ 1.5 million for us to implement this development project. The ADB will be providing a loan upto USD 10 million for research and creation of Railway structure and its architecture work and another loan upto USD 600 million towards building railroads and railway tracks within Colombo and other traffic congested areas.
The Colombo - Rambukkana, Colombo-Kalutara, Colombo - Avissawella and Ragama - Negombo railway tracks are to be improved under the project.

A victory for Malaysia
In what has been described a stunning electoral achievement, Malaysias political patriarch Dr Mahathir Mohamad has become the worlds oldest sitting Prime Minister after defeating Najib Razak in a fiercely contested election that put an end to the ruling coalitions six-decade hold on power.
Mahathirs shock victory has engulfed Malaysia in a state of euphoria. Najib had initially been expected to win easily, but the Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) opposition coalition led by Mahathir raised issues such as corruption and the rising cost of living which resonated with the voting masses in both urban and rural areas.
The win indicates a mood for change, following the Malay tsunami in which many ethnic Malay voted for the opposition for the first time. In fact, the opposition took many states that were considered Najibs Barisan Nasional (BN) strongholds such as Johor, Malacca and Negeri Sembilan. Another significant feature was the higher participation of youth, who mobilized social media to swing the vote in Mahathirs favour.
Mahathir, 92, who was Prime Minister between 1981 and 2003, has been credited with developing Malaysia to its present status and is often compared with the incomparable Lee Kuan Yew, who was instrumental in turning neighbouring Singapore from a sleepy backwater to a world financial powerhouse in a few decades. Mahathir, who still looks youthful despite his advancing years is seen as a stabilising factor and an experienced statesman in a region susceptible to economic volatility and political tensions.
Mahathirs massive win marks the end of a nine-year stint for Najib, who came to power in 2009 and whose reputation was tarnished by the 1MDB corruption scandal in which a staggering US$2.6 billion was embezzled from a Government fund he was overseeing. Investigators believe that nearly US$ 700 million from that fund could have ended up in his personal bank account.
Mahathirs selection as opposition leader had made this a somewhat unusual election because he played a key role in selecting his then protg Najib as prime minister in 2009. The relationship was strained in 2015 after Najib was implicated in the 1MDB scandal, and later Mahathir announced he was forming his own political party (Bersatu) and joining the opposition coalition.
But further change is in the air as Mahathir has said he will only be Prime Minister for two years, and then will cede power to Anwar Ibrahim, once Mahathirs protg, but currently in jail serving a second sentence for sodomy. They had since joined hands and Ibrahim is likely to receive a Royal Pardon that will enable him to take up active politics again.
Mahathir faces many challenges in the next few years and has rightly identified the economy as his number one priority. Malaysias economy is enjoying a strong rebound at the moment, with growth surging to 5.9% last year and forecast by the Malaysian Central Bank to reach 6% in 2018. The Ringgit is the best-performing currency in emerging Asia this year, strengthening 2.5% against the US Dollar. Most of that recovery has come on the back of a pick-up in global trade and rising domestic demand. However, it remains to be seen how Mahathirs more populist pledges such as abolishing the Goods and Services Tax (a move which is said to cost the economy more than US$ 100 billion) will impact on the economy. He has also promised a return to fuel subsides, which is likely to put further pressure on the economy.
Mahathir will also want to raise Malaysias profile on the international diplomatic stage. At the moment neighbouring Singapore has become a more prominent player on the world stage  in fact, the upcoming historic summit between US President Donald Trump and North Koreas Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un will be held in the tiny city state. Singapore and Malaysia themselves remain great friends  Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was the first world leader to congratulate Mahathir on his victory. Mahathir will also seek to eradicate corruption from the political landscape, which has cost the country in terms of investment and development.
Sri Lanka has a great friend in Mahathir. Malaysia under Mahathirs rule was the first country to ban the LTTE, long before India and Sri Lanka did so. Malaysia has always stood by Sri Lanka at international human rights forums and voiced its support. The two countries, which celebrated 60 years of formal diplomatic relations last year, have vowed to enhance trade, tourism and diplomatic ties. Malaysian companies are among the leading investors in Sri Lanka. Bilateral trade amounts to nearly US$ 1 billion, but there is plenty of scope for expansion. There is no doubt that under Mahathirs new rule, ties between the two countries will flourish even more strongly. Likewise, Mahathir will seek to improve ties with all friendly nations.
Malaysians have voted to charter a new course in their journey towards becoming Asias next Japan or South Korea under the steady guiding hand of a senior statesman. It will no doubt be a convergence of hope and faith that has the potential to take Malaysia to even greater heights.

Country will produce 1,000 mw of solar power in next four years
The government has planned to add 1,000 mw of solar power to the national grid within next four years since the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry would be able to reach 2020 target of generating 200 mw by the end of this year, Power and Renewable Energy State Minister Ajith P Perera yesterday said.
He was addressing the gathering at the ceremony held to declare open the solar power panels set up at the Independent Television Network (ITN) at Battaramulla to provide 100 kw - one tenth of the institution's monthly requirement.
State Minister Perera said that by now the Ministry has been able to generate 150 mw solar power of the 2020 target, and the other 50 mw could surely be able to add to the national grid before the end of this year - two years before the date.
During the second phase, the ITN would be provided with solar panels to generate 200 kw. The solar panels worth of over Rs . 18 million were set in its first phase.
The Minister stated that the government has its plans to make the country self -sufficient with the solar power by 2050.
He added that in parallel to this project, several public institutions were provided with solar power.
The Minister said the ITN has focused on solar power for its requirement being the first media institution to do so. He added that even the other institutions could follow the same to enjoy the same benefits.
Dr. Hasantha Hettiarachchi was presented with special award for his contribution to the ITN by producing the Atapattama program, which was presented with the Slim Nelson Award for 10 consecutive years.
ITN Chairman Saman Athaudahetti and Director Board members and high ranking officials of the Abans Group were present.

Leftist parties divided, should come together to develop Sri Lanka - Author:
Karl Marx: Das Kapital 3rd Edition launched
The Sinhala translation of the book Karl Marx: Das Kapital 3rd Edition was launched yesterday, at the Mahaweli Kendraya, with the participation of many admirers of Karl Marx and members of the Communist political parties.
The third volume of the book was translated by veteran journalist Jayatilleke de Silva. Professor Desmond Mallikarachi of the University of Peradeniya, made the key note speech, while JVP Secretary Tilvin Silva and Communist Party Secretary D E W Gunasekara were among the guest speakers.
I started writing the first volume of this book in the year 1987, while I was imprisoned and since then, this book had been the product of my dreams, stated Author Jayatilleke de Silva, speaking about his book. After the translation of the first volume, I realized there were many who wished to read these books and Im sure the generations to come, would be inspired by the visions of Karl Marx, he stated further.
Speaking about the current political situation, the veteran journalist stated that only the leftist parties had the ability to redevelop the country. But the leftist parties are divided and should come together to develop Sri Lanka, De Silva stated.
Jayatilleke de Silva was armed with his political philosophy and language, which makes this translation a masterpiece, explained Professor Desmond Mallikarachchi in his keynote speech. The Professor further stated that only the first volume had been translated to many languages. However, we should be proud about the possession of all volumes of this book in our native language, the Professor pointed out further.
We live in a world where capitalism is in the very latter of life. But capitalism had been able to cover up corruption over the years. However, Karl Marx in his books, uncovered corruption and the loopholes of Capitalism, stated JVP Secretary Tilvin Silva. Labourers are a strong force. Marx gave them a philosophy and united the working masses around the world. He was not just a philosopher, rather a practical man who made his dream a reality and inspired the workers, he stated further. The event was organized by the joint support of the Jathika Widwat Sanwidanaya and Samaja Widya Kendraya.

73rd Anniversary of the end of World War II:
Lessons of World War II remain relevant today
Russian Ambassador Yuri Materiy delivered an address this week at the Russian Centre in Colombo to mark the 73rd anniversary of the end of World War II.
He rekindled the memory of the allied forces who came together to oppose Nazism, and noted the troubling resurgance of neo-Nazism, xenophobia, and racism around the world
Excerpts from the speech.
"We greatly appreciate the contribution of the Allies to our common victory in the World War II, the decisive role played by the peoples of the Soviet Union who defeated the main forces of the Wehrmacht, and other countries that resisted Nazism.
"Any attempts to falsify the history of the war to erase tragic lessons of history from our memory are unacceptable. Together, we must oppose any attempts to whitewash the crimes perpetrated by the Nazis and their collaborators who were convicted by the Nuremberg Tribunal, and to seek punishment for those who have so far managed to escape justice. Such crimes do not have a statute of limitations.
"We resolutely condemn the destruction and desecration in a number of countries of monuments to those who fought against Nazism and the holding of marches by veterans of the Waffen SS, recognised as a criminal organisation.
"Keeping in mind the fact that the desire to translate theories of racial superiority into practice became one of the main driving forces of the World War II, we note with deep concern the revival of Nazi ideology, the alarming growth of associated manifestations of aggressive nationalism, racism, discrimination, intollerance and xenophobia. It is imperative to resist this in a decisive and uncompromising manner.
:In this regard Russia welcomes the UN General Assembly Resolution adopted on December 19, 2017 "Combating glorification of Nazism, no-Nazism and other practices that contribute to fueling contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance". Given the current international environment, we consider its provisions to be particularly relevant.
"The anniversary of the victory over Nazism serves as a reminder to all of us of the need to consolidate the efforts of the international community based on the principle of indivisibility of security, including in order to develop sustainable immunity to the virus of Nazism and its manifestations, and to prevent the recurrence of the 20th century catastrophe, World War II.
"The lessons of the Second World War remain relevant today and it is necessary to combine our efforts and resources to respond to threats and challenges to our common security and stability as well as to protect the aims of principles of the UN Charter.
"Peace in the 21st century is worth fighting for with the same dedication and determination as it was fought for in the past century.
We must treat the future of our children and grandchildren with the utmost gravity and responsibility."

With 18 months remaining: Brickbats outnumber bouquets
Three years into trying out Consensual Governance, the President plainly admitted that the contemporary Sri Lankan politics lack the socio-political maturity required to move forward with a national government system.
The consensual and dialogue democracy is the governing structure of most of the democratic countries in the world today, but it is still an alien concept for us, said the President taking a frank look back.
True, the disillusionment associated with this statement started creeping in long before, but comparing this statement with the Presidents very own words on September 1, 2015, shows the huge chasm between now and then.
It is my belief that the new parliament that commences today will mark an important landmark in the history of Sri Lankan politicsWe have seen in various countries, faced with national challenges, the main political parties come together with consensus to form alliance governments, casting aside their political differencesThis Parliament is setting up a government of consensus for two years to fulfil that national requirement (of speedy socio-economic development)I trust that it will be a start of a new developed political culture of this country, said President Maithripala Sirisena in his first Policy Statement opening the First Session of Eighth Parliament.
Still fresh in memory are his words that resonated with the line of thinking of citizenry giving high hopes for a new political culture of building consensus and ceasing political rivalry. Addressing the same set of MPs while being in the Speakers Chair, the President then said, I am committed to create a new political culture with political leaders with good values, good personality, a good image as well as discipline. These are the qualities an exemplary political leader must have.
Three years down the line, what can be construed is that every step forward has been matched with two steps back. The never-ending power struggle in the Government, between Government and Opposition and within political parties has been a stumbling block to the countrys progress, especially in the last three years, and it continues to be.
Clock is spinning fast
President Maithripala Sirisena, with less than 18 months left to show real progress in turning his words into action and delivering the hitherto unkept promises that propelled him into the highest office, called for unity of all for the sake of country.
It must be noted that the country is not in a situation where it is appropriate for different parties and groups to test their political power, but in a situation where the challenges faced by the nation should be overcome with a collective effort It is the people who become desperate by all forms of conflicts over power, the President said formerly opening the Second Session of Eighth Parliament.
The ceremonial sitting and the Presidents Policy Statement on Tuesday were meant to infuse new vigour to the Government giving hopes for a fresh start. Prorogation of Parliament just before the traditional New Year was a sudden and rather unexpected move by the President, but it was an opportunity for Government to get back on track and speed-up its journey.
The business of first week of new session was encouraging in this light. Two long-awaited pieces of legislation on the anti-corruption front namely the Judicature Amendment Bill and National Audit Bill were on the table this week. Another two amendment Bills to empower the Bribery Commission to file cases based on facts revealed by Presidential Commissions of Inquiry were also presented for the first reading.
Better late than never
Among them, the Government could ensure the safe passage of the Judicature Amendment Bill on Wednesday to provide for the setting up of a permanent High Court to expedite the cases of large scale corruption and financial crimes. The idea of a special court to speed-up the high profile cases strongly came up after the last Presidential Polls, but it did not proceed as the Constitution did not provide for such a move. Setting up separate courts was proposed as an alternative and it took three long years to realize. Despite diminishing hopes and full of scepticism people still welcomed the move as it is better late than never.
The Bill was passed with Amendments receiving 119 votes for and 52 against following a division called by Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa. The JO tried to stand in the way of the Bill even before the debate kicked off. Given the tainted profiles of many JO members, its opposition to the Bill was not that difficult to be comprehended.
The fate of National Audit Bill was unknown when this was written on Thursday. However, given the extent the Bill has already been diluted, especially with regard to its surcharge provision, there was less reason to doubt its passage at this point. The first draft of National Audit Bill was formulated far back in 2004 and it took 14 long years to come to Parliament. The Audit Bill came to the fore during the last Presidential Election campaign of Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena and was also included in the 100-day work programme of the Government.
Constructive criticism
The attendance of Members of Parliament was very good entire this week leading to healthy debates on key legislative matters. Bouquets as well as brickbats came on the Governments way during the full-day debate on the Presidents Policy Statement, but the brickbats outnumbered the bouquets. The Government was under fire for its feeble and lacklustre performance.
JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake in a fiery speech hit hard at the Government and the two leaders at the helm for their failures in all fronts. Opposition Leader R Sampanthan, who earnestly wished to see a final and acceptable solution to National Question within his lifespan, was disheartened that the Constitutional reforms process had been stalled and that the Government was back-peddling on its own commitments. Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, in what one might understand as a constructive criticism, said the execution and delivery of the policies are more important than how they are worded.
The President in the course of his speech made a reference to Vajji at the time of the Buddha. According to history, Vajji was a confederacy of neighbouring clans including the Licchavis in ancient India and Nepal. The Presidents remarks on Vajji were no doubt aimed at Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes frequent mentioning of following the Buddha's preaching to Licchavi princes on meeting peacefully, discussing peacefully and dispersing peacefully'.
The national unity government consists of various political parties having different ideologies. If those political parties must function according to the path shown by the Buddha, giving priority for harmony and consensus as the Vajji at the time of the Buddha, we should also truthfully follow the steps taken by Vajji. As the President during the past three years, I conducted according to those principles, the President worded and one may infer that it was a hint at the Prime Minister.
More than half of the Presidents 35-minitues speech was spent on recapping the achievements of the Government since 2015, where he highlighted the passage of key legislations such as the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Amendment Act that imposed 80 percent graphic warnings on the cigarette packets, the National Drugs Policy based on Prof Senaka Bibiles policy, the Right to Information Act and the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. He added the Government, saddled with a debt burden of Rs. 10.3 trillion, has presented about 18 economy-related bills with a view to manage the debt and enhance the revenue. However, the Policy Statement lacked details of his future course of action for the remainder of his period.
Colourful opening ceremony
The inauguration of new session was marked by solemn ceremony attended by foreign delegates, religious leaders, Provincial Governors, Attorney General, tri-force commanders and IGP. President Maithripala Sirisena and First Lady Jayanthi Sirisena were formerly welcomed on the red carpet by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Parliament Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake. The Head of State was accorded a Guard of Honour and a 21 Gun Salute by elegantly-dressed Army, Navy and Air Force personnel.
The ceremonial sitting was followed by a traditional tea party attended by the Speaker, Prime Minister, Government and Opposition MPs and other invited guests. The ceremonial sitting of Sri Lankas first Parliament was held on October 14, 1947, and Governor Sir Henry Monck-Mason Moore opened the Session delivering a Throne Speech (Raajasana Kathawa) as it was then termed. The Third Session of the Second Parliament was opened by Queen Elisabeth II on April 12, 1954 with a Throne Speech. Policy statements replaced Throne speeches after the endorsement of 1978 Constitution.

50 Greatest Players in World Cup History
It was half-time in the 2010 World Cup semi-final between Spain and Germany. With the score reading 0-0, the players trudged off the pitch, heading to the dressing room in silence. No one said a word except for Carles Puyol.
The defender sought out his Barcelona teammate Xavi and the two were seen speaking animatedly as they headed to the dressing room. Puyol told him, nay, instructed him to do just one thing.
It was a move they had perfected at Barcelona. Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque gave them the go-ahead if there was an opening. David Villa was tasked with blocking Manuel Neuer. Gerard Pique and the others would provide the screen for Puyols run to ensure he was unmarked.
In the 72nd minute, Spain won a corner. Xavi spotted Puyol and crossed the ball with a perfect looping trajectory directed at the penalty spot. The ball seemed to be heading to Pique who had leapt into the air to head it home.
Of course, I was going to head that cross. But at that moment I was overtaken by an aeroplane... - Pique.
Sure enough, Puyol had made the run and launched himself into the air near the penalty spot. Unmarked.
It was the figurative HULK SMASH! moment that saw the centre-back make sweet contact with the ball as it sailed past Neuer - who had been too busy pushing Villa out of the way to get back into position.
In a team of technically gifted players that loved having the ball at their feet, Puyol was their warrior who used brute force to break down the wall that was Die Mannschaft - a team that had conceded just two goals prior to the semi-final.
Full time: German 0-1 Spain. Puyol had scored the all-important goal that took them to Spains first-ever World Cup final. To eventual glory.
Heck, the goal was so important in the history of the country that Puyol even got away with meeting the Spanish Queen wearing nothing but a towel around his waist when she came to the dressing room to congratulate the team as the rest of the squad chanted, Puyi, Puyi!
Spain had never really had any luck in FIFA World Cups. Their best finish prior to 2010 was fourth place back in 1950. La Furia Roja had reached the quarter-finals in some editions, while they had simply failed to qualify for many others.
And Puyol has known heartbreak with the Spanish national team.
He was a right-back in 2002 when Spain were effectively robbed of a semi-final place when two goals against South Korea had been ruled out. The co-hosts would eventually win in a penalty shootout to advance.
In 2006, he had moved to centre-back. But Franck Ribery, Patrick Vieira, and Zinedine Zidane had packed them off in the Round of 16 as France beat them 3-1. It wasnt until Spain won Euro 2008 that the pressure started to mount on them to win the big one. Nicknamed Captain Caveman for his locks and all-around rugged looks, Puyol was a player who knew no pain. The man was stone cold in the face of pain. He has refused treatment for cuts to his face, only jogging to the touchline on the referees orders to get his scalp stapled without flinching even one bit before trying to get the referees attention to return to the pitch ASAP.
When he was once told by the physiotherapist that he had dislocated his elbow, his first response was: You mean I wont be able to play on Sunday The man was an embodiment of the never-say-die attitude that slowly rubbed off on his teammates.
His knee surgery towards the end of his career had prevented him from playing in Euro 2012 but he suffered in silence. He wasnt one to make a fuss and distract his teammates.
What Puyol does best is he keeps everyone on their toes. If his teammates mucked about, he would be the first to chide them before ordering them to get on with the game. When Pique once gave him stick for having a go at him at 4-0 up with three minutes to go, all Puyol said was: So what if its 4-0 Focus! I know you.
2010 was make-or-break for Spain. Although he wasnt the official captain, he was definitely a bonafide leader.
The oldest member of the squad (along with another veteran in Joan Capdevila), Puyol marshalled a defence that listened intently to every word he said.
That was the kind of man Spain needed to be world champions.
A no-nonsense centre-back who would take you by the scruff of the neck and drag you across the finish line - even if there was nobody else left in the race.
Puyol was the only player to score in that crucial semi-final. But he didnt come up with the goods simply because it was a semi-final.
He made the difference because he treated every game like it is the final.
Its why he is on our list of 50 Greatest World Cup Players. - sk
The World Cup final had been deadlocked for 115 long minutes when Fernando Torres tried to pump the ball into the box from the left flank. The ball wouldnt reach the target, the night had taken a toll on the runners. But following some pinball activity at the edge of the area, Cesc Fabregas rolled the ball deftly into the path of Andres Iniesta.
You know what happens next.
Andres settled the deal. The Oranje would wallow in despair. The golden generation of Spain had painted the world red and at the heart of it was this little magician who popped up in pockets he would then transform into treasure troves using the modern form of footballing witchcraft.
One of the greatest players ever to have not won a Ballon dOr, Iniesta typified the technical brilliance of the Spanish like no other. Save the superlatives, Andres Iniestas greatness can be best understood through knowing that Lionel Messi, the greatest footballer on the planet, turns to him in the face of adversity and asks him to come closer; to operate closer to him so that the baby-faced assassins could bludgeon even the most trying of oppositions to eternal rest. The 2010 World Cup happened when Iniesta was working at the peak of his powers and him along with Xavi and Alonso in central midfield would take the mickey out of the hapless opponents who always ended up one yard shorter. It was measured carnage that was twofold- running them short of breath and sapping them of the spirit to play football because nobody likes chasing the ball around the park for an hour and a half.
Iniesta played on the pitch like he was playing PlayStation, sitting on a bean bag, sipping on Sangria. Such was his vision. Thierry Henry had once said that Pep used to instruct his players to stay in position and trust their teammates to find them there. Is it just me or is that just about the most entitled, privileged thing youve heard a gaffer say Dont blame him, blame the likes of Andres for enabling it.
In 2010, in South Africa, Iniesta was constantly playing the right notes and had the world dancing to the tune. He did that while struggling to break out of a dark place like he himself described. He had to battle with injury, depression and the death of a dear friend, Dani Jarque. So when he wheeled away in uncontainable joy, he took his shirt off to reveal a vest underneath with the message, Dani Jarque, always with us. Iniesta was in the running for the Golden Ball and had orchestrated many an important win for La Furia Roja, even scoring the all-important winning goal against Chile in the group stage. He was also the man of the match in the final. Every footballers wet dream. Iniesta did that while just being up to his usual tricks.
With the ball at his feet, Iniesta was a menace the oppositions would have nightmares of and thats the reason why he would come away from the World Cup final with scars all over. It was indeed warfare and it was only fitting that he proved to be the difference between the sides on the grandest stage of em all.
Wherever Iniesta goes, people stand up and applaud and Andres meekly looks up and thanks them all, modest to a fault. And as he walks away from Barcelona, football fans will feel a tug at the heart because there is no way you could love football and not admire this champion that at times we feel like we dont deserve.
The wait for the next Andres Iniesta could never bear fruit for all we have seen and known. And thats quite alright. A highlight reel of Spains finest will stretch till were bloody sick of beauty. Spain hasnt been able to replicate their success from 2010 and they crashed out of the 2014 World Cup in the group stages. But Iniesta will go down in history as one of the greatest ever and when he picked up an injury before the World Cup in 2010, Vincent Del Bosque said that hed wait for as long as it took for Andres to get back because quality like that need not be tried and tested in the training ground.
It is meant to paint itself on the grand canvas and boy o boy, isnt it beautifully poetic how it actually freaking did
Thank you, Andres Iniesta. Of course, he is one of our 50 Greatest players in World Cup history. - sk

Bangladesh disappointed at cancelled Australia tour
Dhaka, Friday: Bangladesh cricket authorities on Friday expressed disappointment after Australia called off a tour by the Asian nation this year because it was not financially viable.
The Tigers were to play two Tests and three one-day internationals in Australia in August and September.
"Australia communicated to us that the series could not be arranged for financial reasons. It is very unfortunate as we were hoping that the series would be a good playing opportunity for our players," Bangladesh Cricket Board chief executive Nizamuddin Chowdhury told AFP. Bangladesh have not visited Australia since 2008 when they played three one-day internationals. The minnows have not played a Test in Australia since 2003.
Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland told the Cricinfo website that the Test series could not be arranged as it coincided with Australia's football season and it was difficult to find a broadcaster.
The BCB chief executive said Bangladesh had proposed a shorter series but did not get a response from Australian authorities.
Bangladesh hosted Australia for a two-Test series last year which ended in a draw. AFP

Cabinet approves Super Critical Coal for Sri Lanka
A policy paper detailing the energy mix for electricity generation which was approved by Cabinet this week calls for the use of clean coal technologies using super critical or ultra-super critical coal.
Coal remains the best least cost electricity generation option, according to energy sector ecperts.
As coal power remains the least cost option, it has been decided that coal power should be there in the energy mix of the country, the Cabinet paper no 21/2018/PE goes on to state. Since environmental conservation is a prime policy, it has been proposed to employ clean coal technologies using super critical or ultra-super critical coal.
The Cabinet has decided that 30 percent of Sri Lanka electricity generation will be sourced from Liquefied Natural Gas, another 30 percent by high-efficient coal power, 25 percent by large hydro, 15 percent from furnace oil and non-conventional renewable energy sources which can be used for firm power.
The Cabinet paper however does not detail the megawatt which would encompass the percentages given. The Joint Cabinet Memorandum submitted by the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry and the Special Assignments Ministry also cites that the Power Ministry has submitted a report to the National Economic Council in April stressing that the powers for preparing policies for the electricity sector be vested with the relevant minister and the Cabinet only.

The Central Bank has been informed to take action to reduce the current lending rates by at least 2% as soon as possible as the current lending rates are far too high, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said yesterday.
He was addressing Southern Province entrepreneurs who attended an awareness programme on the national programme to establish 2000 new exporters by 2020, yesterday. The national programme to encourage new exporters is being implemented by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board.
Hundreds of years ago Sri Lanka was known as a trading center and an entrepreneurs paradise. Artifacts and coins found at archaeological diggings prove that our ancestors have traded with the most powerful trading nations of that era. It is our vision to regain our lost status an entrepreneurs paradise through Enterprise Sri Lanka.
"We will be introducing eighteen new low interest loan schemes under the Enterprise Sri Lanka theme in June. Females and Physically disabled persons will be offered loans at even a lesser interest rate. We will be opening up an Enterprise Sri Lanka customer service counter at every bank.The staff are being trained to provide services with a more positive approach and support innovative projects and ideas
We have decided to act against and also dissuade people from falling prey to high interest loans offered by Micro Finance companies by offering female entrepreneurs with low interest loan schemes. It is mostly females in the Northern, North Central and Eastern Provinces who have fallen prey to these micro finance schemes and there are instances that a few have taken their own lives or have had to even agree to provide sexual favours.We have also decided to ensure that interest on loans below Rs 150,000 obtained from under such schemes be waived, the minister said.
Sri Lankas highest export earnings was in 2017 and the EDBs target is to increase it by another 34% by 2025. Considering the progress being made, I believe that they will surpass this figure before that. Today, our economy is strong and moving forward. Although our forecast national income for the next year is Rs 2.5 trillion we have to repay debts totalling Rs 1.9 trillion, the minister said.

CVI easily curable in children: Dr. Ratnayake
Children who suffer from Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI) can be successfully treated at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) in Colombo, Consultant Paediatric Neurologist Dr. Piyara Dilani Ratnayake attached to the LRH told the Daily News, yesterday.
According to Dr. Ratnayake, it is easy to recognize CVI and easy to treat as well if CVI is diagnosed early. Children with CVI can be treated at the LRH but they should visit the hospital with a referral from an Ophthalmologist from their nearest State hospital. Before visiting the LRH, parents should visit an Ophthalmologist in any State hospital with the child and obtain a referral.
Dr. Ratnayake said children with CVI can see but they (their brain) cannot understand what they see. However, the child's sight can become near normal through therapy and by following the correct procedures. CVI is easy to resolve in many children if it is diagnosed early, she pointed out. Treatment is a continuous process. The rehabilitation process should not be limited to therapy sessions, she added. A child suffering from CVI would already have been drawn to lights, colours and movements.
Contrasting colours such as black and white, blue and yellow etc. should be used during therapy. Patterns such as checkerboards, bulls eyes, etc will help. Anything that has light or movements would be useful in therapy, she added.

Four uncapped players in Lankan Test squad to Caribbean
With injuries once again playing a major role in team selections, the national selection committee headed by former fast bowler Graeme Labrooy have picked a squad of 17 players from what was available to them for the three-Test tour of West Indies starting later this month.
Missing from the line-up that played in the last Test series in Bangladesh in February are experienced opener Dimuth Karunaratne (fractured index finger), batsman Danushka Gunathilaka (hamstring) and fast bowler Dushmantha Chameera (stress fracture of the back), while Lakshan Sandakan who bowls left-arm chinaman has been replaced by uncapped right-arm leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay.
Karunaratne, Gunathilaka and Chameera picked up their injuries during the ongoing SLC Super Provincial tournament and they have been replaced by uncapped opening batsman Mahela Udawatte and fast bowler Kasun Rajitha and Kusal Perera.
Although Vandersay, Udawatte and Rajitha have yet to appear in a Test match along with 20-year-old fast bowler Asitha Fernando all of them have represented their country in ODIs or T20Is.
Apart from the three injured players the selectors did not take into consideration fast bowler Nuwan Pradeep who is also out with a hamstring injury.
Chameera is out for four weeks and Pradeep for six. Both were not considered for selection. Dimuth is likely to be fit for the second Test but we didnt want to take a chance with him so we picked Mahela Udawatte, said chief selector Labrooy.
Udawatte gets a chance to enter the Test stage at the age of 31 after being in the international circuit for more than 10 years having made his ODI debut in 2008.
here are also fitness doubts surrounding white ball captain Angelo Mathews and fast bowler Suranga Lakmal who have been named in the Test squad with a subject to fitness tag against their names. Mathews is coming out of a hamstring injury and Lakmal a side strain.
It is not that they are unfit for the tour but they are short of match practice, they have not played adequate matches. They will play three match-scenario games. Mathews will bat for about 2  to 3 hours and Lakmal will be given enough overs to bowl to prove their match fitness, said Labrooy.
The chief selector also confirmed that both Rangana Herath and Lakmal will play in only two of the three Tests. We have to manage them carefully to get the maximum out of them. We need to have Lakmal fully fit for the World Cup next year.
The selectors had already taken a decision not to put a heavy load on Herath who is the oldest member at 40 and the leading bowler in the team with over 400 Test wickets. They rested him for one match from the two 3-match Test series against India at home and away.
The openers berth with Karunaratne out of the tour has been left open. We have the option of opening with Udawatte, Kusal Mendis, Kusal Perera or Dhananjaya de Silva. We have left the decision to pick the opening combination to the team management, said Labrooy.
Kusal Perera has made his way into the Test squad after an absence of nearly two years. He last played a Test match in December 2016 against South Africa at Port Elizabeth and since then had a series of misfortunes including a provisional ban for failing a drugs test, poor form and injuries.
Because of the distance and long hours to get to the West Indies Labrooy said they had selected a squad of 17 players instead of 16 and included young fast bowler Asitha Fernando.
The squad is due to leave for West Indies on May 25 and play a 3-day warm-up game in Trinidad before commencing a three-match Test series against West Indies at Port of Spain, Trinidad on June 6.

Not bringing in a new Act, not offering a degree under the SAITM name, were among the topics discussed and agreed.
The GMOA expects that the agreements made during the meeting will be put into action without further delay with the consent of President Maithripala Sirisena, because any delay can pave the way for opportunists, like certain politicians and public servants who are determined to make the SAITM issue more complicated, Dr. Aluthge added.

Irelands route to Test match status
When Niall and Kevin O'Brien were going to school in Dublin in the 1990s, they kept their love of cricket to themselves.
For seven decades, cricket suffered under a ruling by the Gaelic Athletic Association that prohibited the playing or watching of "foreign" sports.
And whilst "The Ban" was finally lifted in 1971, the stigma surrounding what was perceived to be an English sport remained so acute that the O'Brien brothers' trips to the Railway Union cricket ground in the Dublin suburb of Sandymount remained clandestine throughout most of their formative years.
Fast forward to this Friday, at a ground just 20km up the road from Sandymount, Niall and Kevin will be parading their skills at the highest level of the game as they line up in their country's inaugural Test match against Pakistan.
On the eve of this historic occasion in Malahide, the BBC World Service's Stumped programme has been charting Ireland's journey to Test cricket and talking to Niall and Kevin about their starring roles in two of the team's most significant victories.
But before we hear from them, let's travel back to 1969 and an unforgettable day in the little-known Northern Irish village of Sion Mills.
THE MIRACLE OF SION MILLS
Midway through their tour of England in 1969, the West Indies travelled to Sion Mills for what should have been a routine hammering of a part-time Ireland outfit drawn from all corners of the Emerald Isle.
Instead, what transpired on that damp morning has become part of the folklore of Irish cricket.
Wicketkeeper Ossie Colhoun, a fitter at the local mill whose 700 employees were given the day off to watch the match, picks up the story.
"The West Indies arrived in a bus and went in to our pavilion, which was tiny, with one toilet and no showers," the 79-year-old tells Stumped presenter Alison Mitchell.
"The two captains went to the wicket and agreed that whoever won the toss the West Indies should bat. Everyone thought the Windies would get three or four hundred for six and bowl Ireland out for about 30.
"But they had just been playing on a hard track at Lord's and this track was damp and slow. So, when the two opening batsmen came out and tried to play their shots, they were through the shots too early.
"Three of them were out cheaply, then there was a run out, and then Clive Lloyd holed out. They just kept hitting the ball in the air and before we knew it we had them 12 for 9. It was hard to believe and even harder to explain.
"The last pair put on 12, so maybe we let them off the hook a bit, but I suppose 25 all out wasn't bad!
"I think the local people wanted to see the West Indies putting the ball into the river. They had long poles and nets for fishing the ball out of the river. We didn't know how many balls we were going to need, but in the end one ball did the trick."
One of the legends around the match is that the Irish players plied their guests with Guinness the night before. But the truth, according to Ossie, is far more prosaic.
"Two or three of the Irish players were staying in the same hotel as the West Indians so as the local guy I agreed to take them to their hotel," he says.
"When we got there the bar was closed, there was a night porter on and the West Indies boys were nicely tucked up in bed.
"There wasn't any alcohol involved at all. It was a miracle, that's what it was."
PAKISTAN PUMMELLED
If qualifying for their first World Cup in 2007 put Irish cricket on the launch pad, then it was their group stage victory over Pakistan that had them shooting off towards the stars.
After bowling out Pakistan for 132 on St Patrick's Day, Niall O'Brien's 72 helped Ireland to the finish line in a nervy chase at Jamaica's Sabina Park.
"We were a bit of a motley crew," recalls O'Brien. "We had a farmer, a painter, a decorator, a postman and I was one of only three or four professional cricketers. But we were a very talented bunch with a great work ethic.
"On that day there were grey skies and there had been rain around. When the covers came off, we couldn't believe what we saw - it was just like playing at home.
"Their total was a low score, but we knew it would be a tough chase because they had a classy bowling attack.
"We just needed a good start and unfortunately we didn't get that, but thankfully things clicked into place for myself.
"When I got myself stumped for 72, I thought I'd let the side down. Then back in the dressing room I heard a couple of roars because Kyle McCallan and Andrew White were both out cheaply.
"We still needed 18 to win and I was really struggling with nerves. Our coach Adi Birrell was too nervous to go out on the balcony, so he just watched it on the TV in the dressing room."
Niall's brother Kevin joined forces with captain Trent Johnston to take Ireland to within a single of the line. And the skipper decided to finish things off with a flourish.
"When Trent hit that six it was euphoric. I imagine it was like someone scoring the winner in the World Cup final, or FA Cup final," continues O'Brien.
"You are so drained from the previous 45 minutes, to an hour. It was a class moment, an iconic moment, and it's kind of set us up for where we are today."
BEDLAM IN BANGALORE
For some in Ireland, true acceptance of cricket would never arrive until they could beat England at that own sport. That feat was achieved in astonishing fashion as Ireland produced the highest run-chase in World Cup history to stun Andrew Strauss and his team at the 2011 World Cup in Bangalore.
This time it was Niall's younger brother Kevin who came to the fore, butchering an England attack featuring James Anderson and Stuart Broad with a record-breaking 50-ball century.
"It was a great day, a World Cup game against the old enemy," recalls O'Brien. "We had played them in 2007 in Guyana but came out on the wrong end of the result so it was nice to finally turn them over.
"England scored 327 but we were quietly confident of chasing it. We had come off two years of good cricket, the wicket was good and it was a very small ground.
"Losing the skipper [Will Porterfield] first ball wasn't ideal, but Paul Stirling and Ed Joyce batted well and got us into a decent position, then we lost a couple of quick wicketsu"
When O'Brien walked to the crease, Ireland had slipped to 106-4. That soon became 111-5 when Gary Wilson was lbw to Graeme Swann in the 25th over.
"The momentum had gone and it was pretty much game over," says O'Brien. "I remember saying to Alex Cusack we could knock it around for another 20 overs, get 250 and lose respectably, or we could have a go, and if we get bowled out for 180 who cares
"So we had a go for about 10 overs and things went our way. And we never looked back. Once it was 15 overs to go and we needed 100 I knew we'd win the game.
"I'd trained very hard, playing some good cricket batting at number six for a couple of years so I knew my role in the team, knew my gameplan very well.
"It was just one of those days - everything I hit came out of the middle and when it didn't come out of the middle it went over the fielders' heads.
"Andrew Strauss dropped me on 91, so there was obviously a bit of luck as well. You need a bit of luck in big tournaments and fortunately for me and the Irish team, we had it that day."
O'Brien's hundred tore 16 balls off the previous fastest in World Cups by Australia's Matthew Hayden.
He adds: "I didn't even know about the record, I'm not one for stats. Once I got to three figures I dropped back a couple of gears and scored 13 off the next 13 balls and then I put in a terrible dive and got run out.
"But fortunately for us, Trent came out and hit his first ball for four leaving us needing eight off 11 balls. I knew we'd done it then.
"In my opinion, 2007 was the biggest win. It announced us on the world stage in our first World Cup, but 2011 reinforced to the cricket world that it wasn't a fluke and we really are a decent team."
A decent team, and now a Test team. Irish cricket, having crossed numerous hurdles in past decades, is now fully fledged member of one of sport's most exclusive clubs.

Lanka, only country with least concern for theatre safety - Consultant Surgeon
Sri Lanka is the only country where Surgical Operation Theatres are functioning without adhering to the terms and conditions on Surgical Operation Theatre Safety recommended by the World Health Organization(WHO), Consultant Surgeon of the Galle Karapitiya Teaching Hospital Dr. Rajitha Abewickrama told the Daily News.
Dr. Abeywickrama had to undergo a one and half-hour operation for a compound fracture on his big toe as the operation theatre table fell on his foot while he was performing a large intestine operation on a female patient.
Dr. Abeywickrama commenting on the incident said that he was the on-call doctor at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital Emergency Trauma Unit attached to the University Surgical Unit and on Wednesday (9) while he was engaged in an operation at the surgical operation theatre, the table suddenly crashed crushing his toe bone in the process.
I believe, this is supposedly the first ever such casualty reported in the worlds health history so far,he said.
I searched over the Internet and found that no such incident had occurred in which a medical staffer faced an accident of this nature in an operation theatre during a surgical operation process, Dr. Abeywickrama said.
Not only at the Karapitiya Hospital, but at all other health institutions throughout Sri Lanka, theatre safety is in a very poor condition. The World Health Organization has introduced a scientific methodology for surgical operation theatre safety. However, proper measures for theatre safety is properly maintained in developed country only, he added.
Most medical staff in operation theatres in the country are not properly trained in operating surgery instruments and appliances. Some hospital employees attached to theatres do not know how to handle surgical equipment properly. Many of the implements, specifically theatre tables in operation theatres are electric or hydraulic operated. Our staff do not know how to manipulate such apparatus. As such the authorities should pay special attention to theatre safety, he stressed
Explaining the incident, Dr.Abeywickrama said that on Wednesday he had to perform three planned operations at the Emergency Trauma Unit Theatre.
I was performing the last operation when suddenly the operating table crashed with the patient on to my big toe. The table is very heavy. However, I managed to extract my big toe which was badly injured. The terminal phalanx was completely crushed. It was during the last stage of the operation and my assistant medical staff had to finish the operation. No obstruction was caused to the operation on the patient. The patient is now in stable condition, Dr. Abeywickrama said.
Specialist Plastic Surgeon Satish Wijemanna performed plastic surgery on my injured toe. I am now staying at the Consultants Lounge. However, I have managed to conduct my usual clinics.
Moreover, the hospital sources revealed that the hospital authorities had not paid serious attention to the incident and they are still to initiate a preliminary inquiry into the accident.
Hospital Director Jayampathi Senanayake told the media that this incident was a minor occurrence.

Mark Williams shows youngsters naked truth about snookers veterans
Tuesday morning and in the cafes of Sheffields Millennium Square talk was still of snooker. I caught the end, quite exciting wasnt it! went one conversation starter, which was quite effusive for Yorkshire.
The previous night, at about 9.50, Mark Williams had channelled calm in the most pressured of moments at the Crucible to win his 18th frame against John Higgins. In the process the Welshman won his third world championship, 15 years after his second, the longest gap in the tournaments history.
It was quite a final, an unexpectedly tense, competitive and thrilling match that put to bed any talk of an underwhelming championship. Barry Hearn would never hint at any such anxiety but the way the impresario stormed into the press area to announce Williams  Cameras at the back! Naked world champion at the front!  suggested he knew he had a story on his hands.
Williams was an outside bet throughout the 17 days of the tournament, he was a champion so unlikely he jokingly promised early in the competition that he would turn up naked to the post-final press conference should he win  and then delivered on the pledge.
When his semi-final against Barry Hawkins finished at midnight on Saturday it was expected the 43-year-old, suddenly bouncing back after so long in obscurity, would fade horribly against the perennial competitor Higgins. Instead Williamss languid, almost sleepy demeanour proved to be an asset.
He stayed calm throughout the final, riding his moments of good form, not dwelling on the bad. He also played some outstanding shots, especially in the closing frames, with the red that opened his final break likely to haunt Higgins for some time. From the other side the Scot was indefatigable, coming back from 4-0 down to 7-7, and from 14-7 to 15-15. So the story is the class of 92 rolled back the clock. Williams, who became the oldest world champion since Ray Reardon won in 1978 as a 45-year-old, certainly celebrated like a man two decades younger. Throughout the early hours his Twitter feed declared his determination to keep drinking (though he has also changed his biography to include three trophy emojis). But as his body will no doubt tell him on sobering up, this cannot go on forever.
With Mark Selby knocked out in the opening round and Ronnie OSullivan defenestrated in the second, the championship provided a chance for snookers 20-somethings to step up.
They did not take it. Kyren Wilson made the semi-finals but was kept at arms length by the 42-year-old Higgins, who also took care of Judd Trump in the previous round.
Hearn used the occasion of the final to criticise the younger generation, saying: Kids today are soft and getting softer. If I was a player who hadnt won the world title Id be spending a long time looking in the mirror and saying: Why
How long can a middle-aged resurgence hold off the millennials The younger players will look at this and think they have another 15 years of coming back here, trying to win it, Higgins said.
That may be true. Unfortunately, next year Williams and Higgins have promised they will still be there waiting for them.

Mosquito eradication in Ampara intensified
The mosquito eradication programme in the Ampara District Coastal areas had been intensified. Awareness programmes are being conducted throughout the district.
Immediately after the rains, low-lying areas along the coastal belt were inundated which became good breading grounds for mosquitoes.
Programmes are being carried out at Divisional Secretariat level. Health Department officials are visiting households at Grama Niladhari Division level to check for mosquito breeding places and advise residents on how to destroy mosquito breeding sites.
The programmes are in progress in state and private institutes as well, including schools and work palaces. The support of the security personnel, including members of the Police and Civil Security Force, Public Health Inspectors, Family Health officials and members of the public are sought in the dengue eradication programme.
Akkaraipattu Zonal Education Director A. M. Rahmathullah had instructed school Principals to draw special attention to the cleanliness of the school environment aiming to curtail the spread of dengue.
Principals were further advised to free the school environment of junk and mosquito breeding grounds with the assistance of SDC officials, parents, staff, and past and present pupils.
The public are advised to dispose their garbage properly and keep the sewages clean. Health Department officers alone cannot eradicate dengue mosquitoes. The public should also extend their cooperation in this task, Health Department officials said.

Jill McIntosh chairperson of Coaching Advisory Panel at International Netball Federation will conduct a two day coaching programs for the Sri Lankan coaches.
According to SLNF their Exco decided to conduct the world recognized coaching programs by the expert where the Ministry of Sports will take care of all the expenses of Jill McIntosh. They will provide all other facilities like auditorium, indoor court facilities and the ground facilities to the coaching programs so why does SLNF charge 5000 rupees each from the participants for the program even without issuing course materials
These federations are not profit making organizations and all the office bearers were working on a volunteer basis. The Ministry always supports sports which dont have proper sponsors.
The Daily News several times tried to contact president of SLNF Trixie Nanayakara via mobile phone but she was not available.
