Ainslie sees huge potential for Asian boom
Tokyo: Master yachtsman Ben Ainslie said the sport has huge potential in Asia after he powered to victory in the first Americas Cup event held in the region.
Ainslies Land Rover BAR won the two-day event in Fukuoka, western Japan, on Sunday, sealing the Americas Cup World Series title and gaining bonus points for next years qualifying competition.
Thousands of Japanese fans turned out for an event which included SoftBank Japan, and Ainslie said he could feel the sport was growing more popular in the region.
The Japanese people have been really supportive of Softbank Team Japan. Its great to have an Asian team involved in this Americas Cup, to be racing in Asia, he told AFP.
Its a part of the world where we want to increase interest in the Americas Cup and add fanbase. So its been a huge success I think, this weekend.
Ainslie, a four-time Olympic gold medallist, guided Oracle Team USA to a brilliant come-from-behind victory at the 2013 Americas Cup.
He is now aiming to make Land Rover BAR Britains first ever winner of the worlds oldest sporting trophy, which dates back 165 years.
Ainslie said he hoped more Asian countries would host Americas Cup events, adding that young Asian sailors were already among the best in the world.
Sailing is a great sport, its a very diverse sport, its very inclusive, he said.
I think in Asia it has huge potential because the conditions in Asia are generally quite light winds, but actually for young people to start and to learn to sail in light winds, its much safer, its much less intimidating.
Fukuoka was the final stage of a protracted qualifying process that counts towards the 2017 Americas Cup Challenger Series, the winner of which will take on Oracle in the 2017 Americas Cup in Bermuda. The Americas Cup dates back to 1851 when the yacht America won a race around the Isle of Wight off the south coast of Britain.
Only teams from four countries -- the United States, Switzerland, New Zealand and Australia -- have won the Americas Cup since then. AFP

Canadas Hughes captures darkness-hit PGA playoff
Miami: Canadian rookie Mackenzie Hughes sank a 15-foot par putt on the third extra hole Monday to capture a darkness-halted playoff and win the US PGA RSM Classic. Colombias Camilo Villegas, Swedens Henrik Norlander and American Blayne Barber all missed shorter putts on the par-3 17th hole at Georgias Sea Island resort to make Hughes only the third PGA wire-to-wire rookie winner in the past 20 years.
Hughes, ranked 287th in the world, booked his spot in next years Masters and PGA Championship as well as the Tournament of Champions in Hawaii in January.
The 25-year-old from Hamilton, twice a Canadian Amateur champion, took his first PGA crown in only his ninth tour start, claiming the $1.08 million top prize as well as playing rights through September of 2019. Others in the playoff took $396,000.
Five players had finished Sunday level for the lead after 72 holes on 17-under par 265, but American Billy Horschel fell out of the playoff by botching a tap-in par putt on the first extra hole. The others all parred 18 again on the second playoff hole before darkness delayed the finish.
Hughes had an eight-foot birdie putt on the second playoff hole to win but missed and needed to two-foot comeback putt to stay in the hunt.
The foursome returned in cold and breezy conditions Monday to a 189-yard 17th hole that surrendered only nine final-round birdies but only six bogeys as well.
All four players missed the green off the tee and Hughes was the only one not to reach the green with his second shot, his chip halting just short on the fringe.
But Hughes found the correct line and rolled home his tension-packed putt to swing the pressure onto his rivals.
I just tried to make it, do my best to make a par and give them something to look at, Hughes said. I figured I had to make it or I would be out. I hit it with good pace. I knew it was on the right line. It was great to see it go in.
Barber missed a 10-foot par putt to fall out and Norlander, playing on a sponsors invitation, blasted out of a bunker to eight feet but missed his par putt, settling for his best-ever PGA finish. That left the stage to Villegas, the only player in the group to birdie the 17th during the week, doing so twice. But the South American missed a six footer to give newlywed Hughes the victory, which he celebrated with a hug from his wife.
Hughes, who had opened with a 61, had been second during the week in scrambling, getting up and down from off the green 17 times in 20 attempts.
Villegas, 34, was the only prior PGA winner among the last four, having sought his fifth tour title after the 2008 BMW Championship and Tour Championship, 2010 Honda Classic and 2014 Wyndham Championship. AFP

Feeling young Pacquiao eager for Mayweather
Manila: REFILES to correct name in fifth para. Please read as xx Jessie xx Vargas sted xx Jesse xx as sent. Here is a corrected repetition
WBO welterweight world champion Manny Pacquiao said Tuesday he felt like a young man in his twenties and would relish another crack at Floyd Mayweather.
The Filipino icon, 37, made a winning comeback from his brief retirement earlier this month and said he was in great shape to try to avenge his defeat to Mayweather last year in the richest fight in boxing history.
I feel young. I feel like Im just 25, or that Im just 28 years old, Pacquiao told ABS-CBN television.
Asked if he wanted to fight Mayweather again, Pacquiao said: Of course, if he wants to come back (to) boxing.
Pacquiao fuelled talk of Pacquiao-Mayweather 2 when he invited the undefeated American, who retired in September 2015, to attend his successful comeback against Jessie Vargas in Las Vegas on November 5.
Last week, Pacquiao teased fans about a possible rematch by posting pictures on social media wearing a suit bearing photos of him and Mayweather in the lining. But Mayweather, 39, said days later he had no plans to come out of retirement. AFP
