Four-lane road for Kandy
As the government devices various ways to get to ease traffic congestion and air pollution in the city of Kandy, State Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe said, the main issue was that there was no consensus between the Mahanayaka Theras in Kandy over the re-opening of the road in front of the Dalada Maligawa.
Environmentalists and planners have pointed out that the re-opening of the road would reduce congestion, ease traffic flow, and minimize the concentration of air pollution in one area.
The government instead has decided to build a four-lane roadway comprised of tunnels to connect Tennekumbura and Suduhumpola to reduce traffic congestion in town at a cost of USD 252.3 million. Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella earlier this year said, steps would be taken to construct a bridge across the Kandy Lake to ease the movement of traffic.
Senasinghe informed the cabinet media briefing that while the Mahanayake Thera of the Malawatte Chapter was agreeable to re-opening the road, the Mahanayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter was opposed to it.
We cant go against the Mahanyaka and open a road. We have a government to run, said Minister Rajitha Senaratne, while Senasinghe added, It is easy to close things, but harder to re-open them. When we go to open it, we also open a whole other can of worms.
UNESCO, in the meantime, has issued warnings repeatedly that Kandy would lose its World Heritage City status if the pollution was to continue. Kandy City was declared a UNESCO World Heritage cultural site in 1988.

Fowzie raises preliminary objections against corruption case
National Integration and Reconciliation State Minister A.H.M.Fowzie yesterday raised preliminary objections against a corruption case filed by the Bribery Commission for allegedly causing a loss of Rs.1.07 million to the government by misusing a vehicle belonging to the Disaster Management Centre.
Accordingly, Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara fixed for May 5 to deliver his order regarding the preliminary objections raised by defence.
President's Counsel Shavindra Fernando with counsel E.Candappa appearing for the State Minister raised preliminary objections on the basis of duplicity of charges.
The defence further informed Court that they were yet to receive certain documents pertaining to the case and thereby the case cannot be fixed for trial.
Meanwhile, the charge sheet consistent with four counts were read out to the State Minister by interpreter-mudliyar.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed this corruption case against the State Minister under Section 70 of the Bribery Act on four charges.
The Bribery Commission alleged that State Minister Fowzie had unlawfully utilised a Land Cruiser Jeep belonging to the Disaster Management Centre between 2010 and 2015,while he was serving as a Senior Minister during the previous regime.
The value of the vehicle was estimated at Rs.19.5 million.

Fresh start for BIA
Today, the newly renovated sole runway of the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA, IATA Code CMB) will be back in business, with the landing of an all-new SriLankan Airlines Airbus A320 New Engine Option (neo) aircraft. The airport was on the verge of being blacklisted as the last resurfacing was completed in 1986.
The US$ 50 million renovation was an integrated project that included the installation of a new energy-saving LED lighting system for aircraft guidance. The runway will be in a good condition for at least another 20 years or 200,000 aircraft movements. Another significant feature was the widening of the runway from 60 metres to 75 metres, which will facilitate landings and take offs by Airbus A380 aircraft. However, boarding will still have to be by mobile staircase as the terminal aerobridges are still not compatible with the A380. That facility will be available after the next expansion of the airport which is slated to begin this year itself.
Future projects include eight more passenger gates, a domestic terminal, a five-storey car-park, and star class hotels neighbouring the airport for which the Government has already sought proposals. A new split-level passenger terminal building, which separates arrivals and departures vertically, a new pier with eight boarding gates, and 14 passenger boarding bridges, with a dedicated gate comprising two passenger boarding bridges for the new Airbus A380, will be included in the proposed new complex. The project is likely to include enhanced transport options to and from the airport.
When the entire project is completed by around 2020, Colombo will be one of the best airports in the region capable of handling around 15 million passengers a year. It is also time to think about a second runway for the BIA, which can get very busy during certain times of the day.
In an encouraging sign for the virtually brand new airport, several new airlines will be flying to Colombo soon. One of the first will be Silk Air, a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines. We are told that several more airlines are waiting in the wings to fly to Colombo.
The tourism and business community in Sri Lanka has strongly advocated an Open Skies policy which will see at least 60 more aircraft movements per day. This will make more inbound seats available for Colombo, which will be a boon for tourism. Actually, the dearth of airline seats into Colombo has been a bane for Sri Lankas tourism industry. One way of addressing this problem, apart from Open Skies, is granting more Fifth Freedom rights (the right given to a third country airline to transport fee-paying passengers to another third country  one good example is the daily Emirates flight to Singapore from Colombo) to foreign airlines. More attractive landing and fuel fees may also induce more airlines to enter Colombo.
This raises the question whether we are actually promoting the BIA among foreign airlines. (This should not be confused with promoting the country as a tourist destination). Most airports around the world have Route Development Officers who scour opportunities for promoting their airports and suggest new city pairs to foreign airlines seeking expansion. As far as we know, Colombo does not have such an officer. His or her duty is to proactively market the airport and its advantages, bringing in foreign airline representatives and attending web-based and physical Route Shops and aviation fairs held around the world.
Colombo has the potential to become a bigger regional aviation hub, but we should be more proactive. The BIA, possibly in conjunction with SriLankan and our missions abroad, must seek direct connections to more destinations especially in Europe, Australia and Africa. SriLankans pullout from Paris and Frankfurt has created a lacuna vis--vis Europe and the BIA should approach established and new European airlines to fill that void. With SriLankan deciding to fly to Australia (Melbourne) from the latter part of the year, Africa should be next. For example, rapidly expanding airlines such as Ethiopian would see potential in a routing such as Addis Ababa-Colombo-Male-Addis Ababa. Colombo should also concentrate on getting more Low Cost Carriers (LCCs).
The partial closure of the BIA also saw an increased demand for the old Colombo Airport in Ratmalana (IATA Code RML) and the Hambantota Rajapaksa International Airport (IATA Code HRI). This is a positive sign. The authorities must now keep up this momentum, perhaps by diverting some of the business jet and regional commercial traffic to Ratmalana. The Government should seriously explore the possibility of expanding the Ratmalana runway to accommodate bigger passenger planes since many other cities have more than one international airport. The Government will also have to address some of the shortcomings at HRI, such as the lack of a proper taxiway and the wrong runway orientation, to attract airlines. Jaffna or Trincomalee would also be ideal as international gateways.
Sri Lanka is in an ideal geographical position to exploit the airlines thirst for new routes especially in the Asia Pacific region. The BIAs new look will be the ideal take-off point for this venture.

Govt. must take action to operationalise truth, reconciliation processes: AI Secretary General
The Sri Lankan government must now take action to operationalise truth and reconciliation processes in the country and publish a timetable of action for delivering these accountability measures, Amnesty International (AI)representatives said yesterday.
Speaking at the Sri Lanka Press Institute,Amnesty International Secretary General Salil Shetty argued that there has been a lot of talk but not enough action on the part of the government on reconciliation.
It does not help that the country will likely have more time to address the matters due to the new United Nations Human Rights Council draft resolution, Shetty said.
The government cannot take the next two years as a moment to do nothing. Its quite the opposite. People have been waiting a long time, and there has been very action on the ground, the Amnesty International Secretary General said.
We called on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to come out with a clear timetable and an action plan on reconciliation, which he promised to do, he said.
Shetty spoke after traveling throughout the Northern Province and meeting with those affected by the war. He noted that there has been some progress, but that more must be done to help victims and to make sure that they are
kept at the heart of the reconciliation process.
He also called on the government to actualize the Office of Missing Persons and ensure that it can function independently.
Shetty likewise demanded the immediate repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which he said had created an environment where enforced disappearances flourished.

Govt. to spend Rs. 900 m for MRCC
The government is to spend Rs. 900 million in the next four years to build and upgrade the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) to provide robust search and rescue services for vessels operating in the region.
As per the Convention for International Civil Aviation 1944, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) 1974, as well as the Law of the Sea Convention (LINCLOS), Sri Lanka s required to maintain a Maritime Search and Rescue Centre. At present, this is the responsibility of the Marine Shipping Secretariat and they have assigned the task to Sri Lanka Navy.
President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Defence, has proposed that these services be improved with greater infrastructure to establish Sri Lanka as a premier maritime nation. He received cabinet approval this week.
Accordingly the project in partnership with the Merchant Shipping Secretariat, Sri Lanka Air Force and Coast Guard Department will build a main centre in Colombo, secondary centre in Hambantota, and seven sub-units in Galle, Trincomalee, Point Pedro, Mollikulam, Arugambay, Batticaloa, and Kallarawa. The budget for the projects will be from the National budgets for 2018, 2019, and 2020.
This would help Sri Lanka respond immediately to vessels in distress within Colombo Search and Rescue zone in order to offer assistance.
Yesterday, the Sri Lanka Navy help douse a fire on board a container ship traveling from Singapore to Egypt. The navy said it had received a distress call on Tuesday when the 14,000-container carrier was about 120 nautical miles (222 kilometres) away from Sri Lanka.

Health Ministry Secretary writes to Foreign Ministry Secretary on Qatar travel ban
A (H1N1) situation in Sri Lanka:
Health Ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama had sent a letter to Foreign Ministry Secretary Esala Weerakoon in connection with the travel ban imposed by Qatar for their citizens in connection with Influenza A(H1N1) situation in Sri Lanka, Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the letter explains the current condition of Influenza AH1N1 in Sri Lanka and the inappropriate travel ban imposed on Sri Lanka. The letter states that in Sri Lanka only 570 found positive for Influenza A virus from the period of January 01st to March 31 this year (2017) and only 58 positive cases found for Influenza B virus.
Under the International Health Regulations 2005, the WHO does not advocate implementation of travel and trade restrictions against any other member states. Even the peak of Influenza A(H1N1) pandemic affecting the whole world in 2009, the WHO had not recommended travel restrictions against any other member country, the letter had pointed out.
In this background, considering the seasonal increase of Influenza activity due to Influenza A(H1N1) on par with the regional situation it does not warrant issue of travel re4strictions to Sri Lanka, the letter stated.
Earlier Qatar Foreign Ministry urged its nationals not to travel to Sri Lanka due to health concerns. A Qatari Foreign Ministry statement stated that the Sri Lankan official authorities confirmed the spread of Swine Flu (H1N1) in Sri Lanka, and reported that a nuber of people were infected of a number of people with the disease and the death of some of them.

India's Kohli, Pakistan's Misbah and Younis, get Wisden honours
LONDON: India captain Virat Kohli has been named as the Leading Cricketer in the World in the 2017 edition of the respected Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, - 'cricket's bible' - published this week.
Meanwhile Pakistan's Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan were named as two of Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year.
According to editor Lawrence Booth, Kohli had "the year of his dreams" in 2016, "averaging more with the bat in each of the three formats than anyone: 75 in Tests, 92 in one-day internationals and 106 in Twenty20 internationals".
Under Kohli, India won series trophies in all three formats against England in 2016/17.
Booth said the star batsman's 235 in the fourth Test against England at Mumbai confirmed him as the "spiritual successor to Sachin Tendulkar".
Kohli is the third Indian to win an award that has only been in existence since 2003 and is designed to recognise achievement in all forms of the international game in the previous calendar year.
Dynamic opener Virender Sehwag won twice, in 2008 and 2009, with Tendulkar himself awarded the title in 2010. The 2017 women's award was won by Australia's Ellyse Perry.
While the Leading Cricketer of the Year award is a relatively new concept by the standards of Wisden -- a British-based publication which has appeared every year since 1864, with not even the First and Second World Wars halting its print run -- the Five Cricketers of the Year is a tradition that dates back 128 years.
The usual criteria for inclusion in that award, which can only be won once in a player's career, is the impact a player had on the preceding English season.
Veteran batsmen Misbah and Younis were both honoured in the context of their performances during Pakistan's 2-2 Test series draw in England -- a result that saw Pakistan, under Misbah's captaincy, briefly rise to number one in the world Test rankings.
"Misbah-ul-Haq was central to one of the most riveting series in England for years," wrote Booth.
"His century in the First Test at Lord's set a benchmark for his team-mates, while his celebratory press-ups became one of the motifs of the year.
"Against the odds, he led Pakistan, without a home Test since 2009, to the top of the rankings -- and all at the age of 42."
Turning to Younis, he added: "With the pressure on, Younis Khan delivered. His classy 218 in the final Test of the summer, at The Oval, helped Pakistan square the series after successive defeats had left them in danger of squandering their win at Lord's.
"It was his 32nd Test hundred -- and a reminder that his struggles earlier in the series had been a blip rather than part of a decline."
England all-rounder Chris Woakes, who enjoyed a breakthrough year in 2016 that included 26 wickets at 16 apiece in four Tests against Pakistan, was also one of Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year.
Middlesex's Toby Roland-Jones, whose hat-trick against Yorkshire at Lord's sealed the County Championship title for the London club, and Northamptonshire batsman Ben Duckett, who scored 2,706 runs in all formats during a prolific season, completed the quintet.
Reflecting on other topics, Booth said Alastair Cook had chosen "the right time to go" in resigning as England's Test captain following the 4-0 series loss in India. However, he added: "That his team lost only four of his 17 Test series in charge was testament to a very English grit: understated, occasionally self-conscious, always bloody-minded. It proved an exhausting combination." - AFP

Israeli election date moved 'to avoid clash with Britney Spears concert'

Britney Spears is reportedly the reason for why a forthcoming Israeli election has been delayed, the Independent reported.
The pop artist is scheduled to perform at a concert in the country on 3 July, which wasthe same day as the primary for the Israeli Labour Party.
However the election is now going to take place the following day, on 4July.
A statement released by the party said: "The election date was delayed by one day due to the fact that there is a major event at Yarkon Park on 3 July, 2017."
Jerusalem Onlinereports that the change took place due to a "major event" in Tel Aviv's Yarkon Park - which would presumably cause disruptions in the city centre and waylay party members trying to get to polling stations.
Haaretzreportsthat a senior party source said there would also be issues of security, as many guards would be employed securing the concert.
It was not revealed whether party officials were planning on going to the concert themselves.

The Court of Appeal today fixed for support on September 15, the appeal filed by the Attorney General against the sentences imposed on the convicts of British aid worker Khuram Sheikhs murder saying they were not sufficient.
The bench comprised Appeal Justices Deepali Wijesundara and Lalith Jayasuriya.
Four convicts; former Tangalle Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Sampath Chandrapushpa Vidanapathirana, Lahiru Kalum, Saman Deshapriya and Prageeth Chaturanga who were found guilty of killing British tourist Khuram Shaikh in December 2011 and for raping and brutally assaulting his fiance while holidaying at the tourist resort of Tangalle were sentenced by the Colombo High Court.
While requesting to amend the punishments given to the convicts the AG also suggested that these convicts should be given death sentence or life imprisonment as they committed the murder using weapons as members of an unlawful assembly.
Through this appeal, the Attorney General maintained that the sentences imposed on the convicts of British aid worker Khuram Sheikhs murder were not sufficient.
The petition also noted that the Judge had reiterated that fourth accused in the unlawful assembly had used a firearm and that in cases of unlawful assembly an offence committed by one applies to all in the group. Counsel Darshana Kuruppu appeared for the accused.

Laugfs Group IT gets ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certification
Laugfs Group IT received ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certification for the recently implemented Information Security Management System (ISMS) from Bureau Veritas.
Implemented with the expert assistance of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the security system manages and controls information and risks in security whilst maintaining the integrity, protection and preservation and confidentiality of information.
Commenting on the ISMS implementation and the significance of receiving the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certification,Laugfs HoldingsGroup Chief Information Officer, Indika Gunawardena, said, This is a significant achievement for Laugfs and a testament to our continuous commitment to our customers data security. ISO 27001certification requires rigorous and repeated external assessment and demands applicants to meet high standards of risk management and security controls on an on-going basis. This year we will further strengthen our Business continuity and Disaster Recovery capabilities by going for Businesses Continuity Management (BCM) - ISO 22301, which will certify our existing BCM best practices.
ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certification requires organisations to follow rigorous standards in establishment, implementation and maintenance of information security management systems as well as continuous service enhancement. Moreover, the criteria mandate specific requirements for organizations to assess and handle information security risks in line with the needs of the organization.
ISO/IEC 27001 is the best-known standard in the ISO 27000 family providing requirements for an information security management system (ISMS). An ISMS is a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information so that it remains secure. It includes people, processes and IT systems by applying a risk management process. Organizations, which meet the standard are certified compliant by an independent and accredited certification body on successful completion of a formal compliance audit.
This certification further assures our valued customers of our inherent capability to manage both information systems and information itself according to international best practice security standards. It is also important that all businesses under the Laugfs Umbrella have confidence in the range of services we provide for them to have guaranteed system uptimes and information security. Both parties will now have increased confidence as an accredited third party has validated our processes by awarding ISO27001 certification, Laugfs Holdings Security Operations Center Assistant Manager Eranda Dayawansa said.

The president said this while addressing a ceremony held at the Presidents House in Colombo where a donation of Rs. 25 million was made to the Insurance Trust for Sri Lankan Singers.
The President said it is necessary to bestow value and respect upon artistes who entertained a nation through their talent. He said it is essential to look after the well-being of them and the current government is taking all necessary action in this regard.
While stating that art, literature and music has no politics, the President declared that he respects all artistes of this country just as artistes, irrespective of which political stage he stands on.
The President, recalling how he took steps to make contributions to assist artistes during their illnesses or to their families during the death of an artiste, assured them he would continue to provide such services in the future too.

The proposed new Inland Revenue Act which is expected to remove ad-hoc and unproductive tax concessions will propose that income tax incentives be based on the investment made on the capital assets, employment generation and the area in which the investor invests.
These incentives in future will also be only dealt under the Inland Revenue Law.
The government stressed that this would broaden the income tax base by removing excessive tax incentives/expenditures and thereby raise government revenue.
The proposal made for the above by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake was granted Cabinet approval on Tuesday.
In accordance with Budget 2017, the government is presently is drafting a new Inland Revenue Act and the Finance Minister also sought cabinet approval for an incentive scheme for Small and Medium investors who invest between 2017-2017 to be included in the new Inland Revenue Act.

Health Minister and Co-Cabinet Spokesperson Rajitha Senaratne yesterday refuted claims that there was H1N1 epidemic in the country. The disease is spreading but according to Ministry of Health reports, the situation is not dire, the Minister said.
He was addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at Parliament.
He further explained that of the 3,548 suspected samples suspected of H1N1 influenza sent to the Medical Research Institute, only 528 have proven to be positive.
The media is blowing this out of proportion. As a result the Government of Qatar has issued a travel warning against us, Minister Senaratne said.
Senaratne stressed that H1N1 was not to be feared but was only dangerous to pregnant mothers, children and kidney patients, This is just a new form of the influenza and this is seasonal depending on the changes in the weather. April is a month known for the spread of H1N1, the Minister further said.
The University of Peradeniya closed down this week as a result of an H1N1 spread among the students and the Central Province has been marked as a high risk zone for the flu. The minister however denied the report and stated that they have not identified a significant increase in the number of patients in the Province.

No room for MR to form government: SB
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa does everything to remain in politics. No chance is available for him to form a Government after one or two Vesak Poya as he tells as MPs in the Joint Opposition are holding discussions to join the Government, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake said.
Addressing the media at his Ministry at Sethsiripaya, Battaramulla yesterday, he said MP Bandula Gunawardena tells whatever comes to his mouth and Basil Rajapaksa always talks on money. Prior to last May Day, some had given money for some MPs to stop them from taking part in the SLFP May Day rally 2016, but all of them turned up in the rally. The SLFP is ready face any election, Minister Dissanayake said.
According to Minister Dissanayake, the former President lost 1.2 million votes at the 2015 Presidential Election. The UNP did not have those 1.2 million votes but the `Swan' received them. One of the main reasons behind the former President's instant call for a Presidential election in 2015 was the Geneva Human Rights issue, he said.
The minister said four politicians and War Heroes had been named as war criminals. Economic sanctions were about to come. But the Government overcame those problems, he said.

Orienteering an ideal sport for Sri Lanka
The Sri Lanka Orienteering Federation (SLOF) will launch an island-wide campaing to introduce this lesser-known, but ideal sporting activity to many parts of Sri Lanka. The campaign will include awareness programmes and exhibition events focusing on sports clubs and selected schools in every district. In additionally SLOF will conduct training programs and promotional events in all districts. As the initial step, training camps for players, coaches, referees and Judges are to be held in Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara districts in the Western Province.
Orienteering is a sport that combines both physical and a mental elements. The basic idea in orienteering is to proceed from course start to finish by visiting a number of control points in a predetermined order with the help of map and compass. In order to choose the best possible route, orienteers look at the characteristics of the terrain and the winner is determined by the fastest time to complete the course. What is unique to orienteering is that an orienteer must navigate and make quick decisions while running at high speed. Orienteering is a low-cost sport suitable for both genders and all ages. SLOF has made arrangements to educate interested parties about orienteering possibilities in country.
The sport of orienteering was first practised in the military but nowadays it features a variety of different formats ranging from the more traditional long distance forest races to the more recently developed city sprints. With the use of electronic punching and GPS tracking, orienteering has become a sport visible to the audiences with real time broadcasting on TV and the internet.
The International Orienteering Federation has four official disciplines: foot, mountain bike, ski and trail orienteering. The first foot and ski orienteering competitions are known to have been held as early as the 1890s. Mountain bike and trail orienteering are rather more recent formats that evolved during the last decades.
The International Orienteering Federation was recognised by the International Olympic Committee in 1977.
The yearly international championship events include World Orienteering Championships, Junior World Orienteering Championships and World Masters Championships. The IOF organises an annual World Cup. The international event calendar also comprises more than 100 World Ranking Events. Regional Championships take place in five out of six IOF regions: Europe, Asia, North America, South America and Oceania.
Orienteering is already in more than 80 countries around the world and also a part of multisport games such as the World Games and the World Masters Games. FISU organises World University Orienteering Championship and World University Ski Orienteering Championship bianualy. CISM organises yearly World Military Orienteering Championship and ski orienteering is part of the CISM Winter Military World Games and 2017 United World Games.
SLOF conducts free orienteering training programs in Panadura. SLOF will assist schools, sports clubs who are interested in Orienteering. More details can be obtained through [emailprotected] Web- www.orienteering.org FB- Orienteering Sri Lanka and contact No .0112437324.

Agreements concerning Htota Port project will be presented in House: PM
All agreements entered into between Sri Lanka and the Chinese Company in relation to the Hambantota Development Project would be presented to Parliament following the agreement being inked, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He also said that the government had no preliminary agreement entered into with a Chinese company to continue with the Hambantota Port project.
The Premier made these observations yesterday, in response to a question raised by Joint Opposition Parliamentarian MP Dullas Alahapperuma.Those who planned to set up a port at Hambantota during the last government, predicted that all ships navigating the Indian Ocean would arrive there to obtain its services and to pump oil, but their plans were far from reality, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday.
They thought that ships would come there the way vehicles come to petrol sheds at Alexandra Road in Colombo and to many other petrol sheds to pump fuel. Ships do not come to harbours in that manner. Not only their policy planning was wrong, but also the agreements they entered into with China over the Hambantota Port were not favourable to our country, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that there was no draft bill to sell the Hambantota Port to a Chinese Company. I will reveal everything with regard to the Hambantota Port project since its inception, Premier Wickremesinghe said. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa took a loan from Exim Bank in 2012 for the construction of the Hambantota Port. The grace period was 48 months and thereafter, the loan had to be settled. At least a petrol shed could not earn profits within four years. We had to settle the loan since 2016. According to article 14 of the agreement, in the event of default of paying a premium, we would have to settle the entire loan and the interest. It is about US$ 1,400 million. How could it be done by those who cant settle at least one premium.
However, he also said the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa came up with a new proposal as the Port suffered a loss. When the Chinese President visited Sri Lanka, a Government to Government agreement to assist the Silk Road project and to continue with the Hambantota Port Project was initiated. It was a new agreement, the Premier said. It was a SOT(Supply, Operate and Transfer) agreement. We had invested 35.2 percent, while the Chinese Government the rest. But the Chinese company included its interest in to the investment too. The previous government had sold the country. Hadnt it Another condition in the agreement was that the Chinese Company would not develop the completing Infrastructure for a period of eight years. So we pay the loan and give eight years to them to do whatever they want. Isnt it selling the country
The Premier also said the previous plans envisaged to give outright ownership of the Hambantota Port terminal to a Chinese company. Soon after we came to power, we went for re-negotiations. We got the term outright ownership for the Chinese company removed. We pointed out to the Chinese government that the agreement they signed with our predecessors were not for the best interests of Sri Lanka and we needed to re-negotiate the terms. The Chinese government agreed. They named two Chinese companies, China Merchants and China Harbour, the Premier said. We are holding discussions with them. This evening too there is another round of talks to be held. Instead of handing over the port to a Chinese company, we intend to convert it into a joint venture. The previous arrangement was to go for a SOT (Supply, Operate and Transfer) agreement. We changed this into an agreement with clauses and terms more favourable to our country.
He also said that the companies were in the SOT agreement entered into by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. However, with the new joint venture they agreed to allow us to lend it even to some other country, the Premier said. Thereafter the Chinese Company in the joint venture agreed to pay us US$ 1,100 million and so far we had settled US$ 300 million to the Exim Bank. When it is given, our loan can be settled two years earlier.
He said in the new agreement this government pointed out Sri Lanka was the hub in the Silk route and China agreed. In the new agreement both have agreed to develop the infrastructure such as the port and to promote joint businesses by sharing culture, economy, science and technology in a manner where both countries share equal benefits.
The previous government had agreed to grant out right ownership of the Colombo Port City to the Chinese Company, the Premier said. I removed it from the agreement. If it were given, the exclusive economic zone in the sea would be owned by the China Harbour Company. Hadnt the previous government sold the country Now we attempt to lease this and reduce the loans and VAT. Do you object 
Joint Opposition Member Dullas Alahapperuma raising a question demanded the Hambantota Port agreement be presented in Parliament. He added that it is said a draft bill has been formulated to sell the Hambantota harbour and Cabinet has granted its approval. He added however the relevant minister had said the Cabinet approval had not been granted, but a Cabinet sub committee had been appointed on the matter.
As it is said that Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka had resigned from the said sub Committee and as Vasudeva Nanayakkara has filed a case before the Supreme Court on this matter, the people need to know about it. So we need to know as to whether the Prime Minister would present the agreement on the Hambantota Port Development Project which is said to have approved, Alahapperuma said. The experts think the 99 year lease of 80 percent of the port affects the national economy and the national security. It is said that the Port Minister too objected to the agreement saying that there could be one with much advantages to the country. He added that a newspaper had carried a news item that a Chinese investors had come to Colombo to buy the Hambantota Port.
Dullas Alahapperuma said that a land extension of 500 acres belonging to the Ports Authority had been leased for 99 years at a rate of Rs 494 million per year. But a 4 hectare land already had been granted to a Gas company at a rate of US$ 50,000 each Alahapperuma said. Why cant the 500 acre be leased out at such a rate
Premier Wickremesinghe responding to MP Alahapperuma said how could some one sell a 50 acre land at a rate of 20 per perch. He said that there was nothing to talk with some one who did not understand such a small matter. He added that a land which is near the road had been leased at the rate of US$ 50,000 per hectare.
Aluthgamages house in UK: Dy Minister Ramanayake tables document involving MP
Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake yesterday in Parliament, tabled a document obtained from UK authorities over a house in London allegedly owned by MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage.
The Deputy Minister said the house which was purchased for Sterling Pounds 320,000 by Asha Aluthgamage and Mahindananda Aluthgamage in 2008, had been reportedly sold at Sterling Pounds 470,000. He requested investigative bodies to look into this property.
Certain MPs, who were spending ordinary lives, acquired enormous wealth disproportionate to their known incomes after they entered Parliament. I request the investigative bodies to probe into these properties, apple gardens and Panama Papers, he said.
However, UPFA MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara pointed out that it was improper to make allegations against an MP when he was not present to reply. Either you bring in a substantive motion in this regard or make the statement when the MP is around to reply, he said.
Deputy Minister Ramanayake, who first mentioned that the house was owned by an Aluthgamage, was asked by other members to reveal the name properly as UNP MP Ananda Aluthgamage rose to a point of order demanding that he reveal the full name.
Former Chief Justice was also appointed from unofficial bar: Dilan Perera
Former Chief Justice Dr Shirani Bandaranayake was also initially appointed as a Supreme Court Judge from the unofficial bar, State Minister Dilan Perera said.
He was commenting on the controversy surrounding the appointment of Ramanathan Kannan as a High Court Judge.
Supreme Court Judges, Appeal Court Judges and High Court Judges have been appointed from the unofficial bar even during the past. Some are attempting to give it a racial twist, and I strongly condemn it, he said.
UPFA MP Dullas Allahapperuma pointed out that the next in line in the eligible list for the appointment was also a Tamil speaking person. Replying to this concern, Perera said he too has a problem with the appointment, adding that his opposition is only for those who criticize the appointment on racial lines.
He also pointed out that Constitutional Reforms could provide answers to most of the prevailing problems in the Judiciary. He said almost all in the Steering Committee are in agreement with the proposals with regard to the Judiciary.
Misleading court by concealing vital information a serious offence: PM
The Joint Opposition Parliamentarian who filed a case before the Supreme Court would have to apologize to the Supreme Court by offering a sheaf of betel for misleading the Court by concealing some vital important in the case that he filed against the Hambantota Port agreement, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation in response to a statement made by Joint Opposition member Dullas Alahapperuma in Parliament saying that MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara had filed a case before Court against the Hambantota Port agreement.
The Premier further said that the previous government entered into the agreement with the Chinese Government on the Colombo Port City Project and the Hambantota Port Development projects. The Joint Opposition member without revealing that he was a Cabinet Minister then, had filed a case as if was ignorant of the government to government agreement, the Premier said. We are waiting until he appears in court. He will have to be imprisoned for concealing important facts to Court. But as the petitioner is my friend, I dont plead to do so. But he will have to pay a fine,
The Premier also said that it seemed that the Joint Opposition members have a desire to be imprisoned.
MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara who said that he had filed a case before Court on the questioned matter and MP Alahapperuma who mentioned it in Parliament, said that the Premiers statement that he would have to be imprisoned was wrong.
Responding to it, the Premier said that he did not say something, but said that JO members seemed to have a desire to be imprisoned.
Due to arms, drugs smuggling and anti-human trafficking: Silawathura and Mullikulam Navy camps will not be moved: PM
The government would not move out the Navy camps set up in Silawathura and Mullikulam as they were essential to prevent arms and drugs smuggling and anti-human trafficking operations, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation in response to a question raised by SLMC Parliamentarian MHM Salman who demanded that the Navy base in Silawathura be shifted and the lands should be given to civilians.
The Prime Minister said that a Navy Base had been established in Silawathura Grama Niladhari Division of the Musali Divisional Secretary Division of the Mannar District. He added that the location of the Navy base is strategically important for National Security and to combat arms and drug smuggling taking place off the North-Western and Northern coasts. It is an important location in terms of the preventing illegal migration and illegal transportation of goods too, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
The Premier also said the Sri Lanka Navy is currently occupying a land in extent of 34 acres, 02 roods and 8.43 perches. It had already been decided to release 06 acres, 02 roods and 8.43 perches out of this land, the Premier said. Action is being taken to release this portion of land to the owners, through the Divisional Secretary, Musali. He added that so far, 66 persons have claimed ownership of the land. Out of this number, 38 persons are dead. The Government has given alternate lands of 20 perches each to 12 persons and 04 houses have been constructed.
The Premier also said that action is being taken to acquire the land to the Government for the use of the Sri Lanka Navy under the Land Acquisition Act. He also said that instructions have already been given to the Divisional Secretary  Musali to make the necessary arrangements to provide compensation to the lawful owners of the lands according to Government valuation.
In the meantime, responding to a question raised by TNA Parliamentarian Charles Nirmalanathan who urged the government vacate the Navy camp at Mullikulam and return the lands back to the civilians there, the Premier said that the Navy camp had been set up in government lands so that there was no need to remove it.
Resolution to increase wages of judiciary gets Parliament nod
Parliament yesterday, approved a resolution to increase the salaries of the Chief Justice and Supreme Court and Appeal Court Judges.
The Justice Minister moving the resolution for debate, said that the salary structures of judges in other courts too would be revised shortly.
He however stressed that the resolution had no connection with the salaries of MPs and Ministers. He made this clarification referring to certain media reports that said the revision of salaries of judges was a means to raise the salaries of Parliamentarians.
The minister participating in the debate, said a new method would be introduced in granting promotions to judges. There is no proper mechanism in this regard.

Rajinikanth to replace SRK as Malaccas ambassador
Superstar Rajinikanth might replace King Khan as the Brand Ambassador of Malaysian Tourism. Reports suggest that the Minister of Tourism and Culture of Malaysia, Datuk Seri Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz, proposed Rajinis name and indicated that Malacca should replace Shah Rukh to appoint Rajinikanth as the states tourism ambassador. Apparently, it was well received by the MPs of the Malaysian Parliament.
One may recall that Rajnikanths last blockbuster Kabali, which was about Malaysian Tamils, was shot mostly in Malaysia - with only a few segments in Chennai and Hong Kong. Incidentally, the actor has a huge fan following in the country - and the crowd that would gather whenever he came out of the hotel for shooting or was at outdoor locations - was testimony to it.
The film which was also released in Malay, was well-received. Considering the kind of fandom Rajini commands in Malaysia, the tourism board seems confident that his replacement of SRK (who has been endorsing since 2008) would yield better results.
Nearly a decade ago, Shah Rukh was awarded the title of Dato, which is equivalent to Indias Padma Awards. Close sources say that the Malaysian government is now planning to confer Dato on the Enthiran star.
Meanwhile, it is interesting to note that the first couple of Malaysia, Prime Minister Dato Sri Mohammad Najib bin Tun Abdul Razak, and his wife, Datin Paduka Seri Rosmah Mansor, who are Indian cinema buffs, became fans of Rajinikanth during the actors long stay in Malacca, for the shooting of Kabali.
The Baasha stars close aides confirmed to DC that talks are being initiated on the matter. However, with Rajinikanth, who keeps his cards close to his chest, one really cant predict how he would react.
We have to wait and watch to see whether he accepts the invitation from the Malaysian government!

## Title: Ravi Jayewardene, prince and pauper
## Supertitle:

Ravi Jayewardene, prince and pauper
An otherwise obvious clich needs to be reframed to draw out the lessons from the life of Ravi Jayewardene who passed away at the age of eighty whose obsequies will be held today, April 6.
It is not enough to say that he was the only son of President J.R. Jayewardene. It cries out for far more precise qualification.
He was the humble, fearless, bold and wise son of President J.R. Jayewardene, who did many things right and a few things not quite right. The mortal remains of his only son lies at Wijayanthi the stately ancestral home of the Jayewardene family where he was born.
The point needs emphasis. Giving to the nation is a dying art in this age when duty free sports utility vehicles are a must for the practice of the sport called politics.
Today it is the Library and Museum of the Jayewardene center. That it is now in a state of disrepair in the custody of the state is a commentary on our indifference to our recent history as a civic nation and our preoccupation with the mythic history of the Sinhala tribe.
Ravi Jayewardene conceived the idea of creating a special combat force that could be rapidly deployed to execute special tasks at the height of the civil war. The force was organised, trained and equipped under his watchful supervision and with his exceptional ability to involve and motivate others whose views and contributions he recognized and respected. He emphasized honour, courage and commitment.
JVP insurrection
We must celebrate the life of Ravi Jayewardene not so much for his self-effacing nature but for his lifelong contempt for sycophants. If he had any, they would have by now dubbed the Special Task Force with an inane moniker such as Ravis Regiment!
His cousin Nallinka Jayawickreme daughter of Wilmot Jayewardene, President J Rs youngest brother recalls how the police raided her home in search of Ravi during the first JVP insurrection. They virtually turned the house upside down despite our protests that he wasnt there.
The Police later arrested him at the Ratmalana airport where he was getting ready for a routine Air Ceylon flight which he was then serving as a pilot in command. Recalls Nallinka, the police drove him off in police car with his Simca driven by a police officer tailing. Ravi aiya told us let the law take its course.
He was a well-known marksman. He practiced shooting. He was the son of the Leader of the Opposition. The police may have been anxious to connect some of those dots with the dots of their dotty minds. Yet it is inconceivable that they acted independent of any political direction. The news of his arrest and detention reached parliament which was in session. This writer was then a Lake House reporter covering parliament.
The father was visibly angry. When he rubs his right index finger on his ample nose it was a signal of immense fury held in control by a steely resolve. Not a word from the Sphynx. Son Ravi remained impervious to the temporary inconvenience. Soon he was released at midnight. He refused to leave and waited till arrangements were made to take him back to his home in Ward Place.
Fearless to a fault
A few years later Sirimavo Bandaranaike was stripped of her civic rights on grounds of abuse of power. When those events unfolded and many wondered about her alleged offenses and the punishment meted out, this writer recalled a conversation in the parliamentary restaurant which he overheard. Dr. N.M. Perera was telling some around him This is something Dicky will never forgive.
Ravi J was not J.Rs Achilles heel. Ravi was Perseus to JRs Zeus. In his own right Ravi has slain many a Medusa. Ravi Jayewardene was unbelievably humble. Born with the proverbial silver spoon in his mouth renunciation came to him early. In the many phases of his life he was a mischievous Siddhartha, a probing and curious Siddhartha and a tranquil Sidharatha. That said Renunciation was the overarching spirit that marked his eighty years on earth. He was truly humble. He lowered himself to serve others with remarkable ease, immense charm and a mesmeric magnanimity.
He was incredibly bold. Almost all his life, in the shadow of his giant of a father who made the pursuit of power his vocation, Ravi J was unhesitant to speak truth to power. He was wise. He acquired an incisive knowledge of whatever that interested him. He was fearless to a fault.
It is said that President J.R. Jayewardene did not groom his son for a political career. Steeped as he was in history and philosophy why should he bother It is not every fathers good fortune to sire a Siddhartha.
Readers please note. The use of the term Sidhdhartha is in the context of its use by Herman Hesse: Suffering, Joy, Rejection, Revival, Peace and finally wisdom.
Good by sweet prince, may flights of devas sing thee to thy rest.

RTCs Spring Family Race Day, a rainy thriller
The Royal Turf Club, staged the Spring Family Race Day on 2 nd April to thousands of spectators who thronged the race course up in Little England. Despite the rain, all present enjoyed the day which apart from good sport, provided entertainment for the whole family.
The R.T.C. Nuwara Eliya Festive Cup, the first race of the day saw a gutsy performance by GR.M. Queen of the Hill who despite being the slowest of all and had lost considerable ground, produced a lightning run in the home stretch to pip the winner to the post.
The Daily Mirror Cup was won by the bottom weight Crimson Quest who had finished 2nd in the last outing in Class 5 with a back breaking weight of 61.5 Kgs. Crimson Quest is Owned by Gamini and Chamari Jayaratne and is trained by S.V.Madialagan and ridden by Jockey S. Suganthan.
The Media Ministry Challenge Trophy was the 3rd race of the day and was won by Kingston Town the latest import from India.
This was his 1st race on the Sri Lankan turf and he made a good impression, also giving trainer Manishraj Sethi who was licensed this year by the Royal Turf Club his maiden victory. Kingston Town is owned by Hasanga Jayaratne in partnership with J.R. Irugalabandara.
Spearhead carrying the top weight in the race who had won many accolades in his career and made his owners proud on every occasion he raced, having even beaten the King of Nuwara Eliya Atlantus, would be retired from his illustrious and graceful racing career and given a happy retired life as per the owners of Spearhead.
The Feature Race of the day, the Selvaratnam Challenge trophy was won by the queen of the Royal Turf Club and the public favourite, namely Alcazaba who lived upto the expectations of her supporters and also made owner Deepthika Jayakody proud once again by producing her customary late challenge and winning the race even after carrying a back breaking weight of 61.5 Kgs.
Sponsor Chavez Selvaratnam and family were delighted and in awe at the manner in which the races were conducted, as well as the quality of the entertainment, in this case the band Heat and the RTC Fashion Parade by Deepthika Jayakody.
Unfortunately the rain gods decided to play spoil sport and eventually the 5th, 6th and the 7th races were called off keeping in mind the safety of the horses and jockeys as the underfoot conditions were not conducive for racing.

Treasury Bonds issue: Legal action based on findings of CID probe, Pres. Commission recommendation

Tribute to Most Venerable Davuldena Gnanissara Mahanayaka Thera: Example he left behind
The last decades of the English rule in Ceylon left much room for cultural exploration. English scholars such as Professor Rhys Davids founded Pali Text Society in a bid to offer more emphasis to Buddhist studies. The Buddhas teachings had a constructive discourse owing to many factors.
Most western scholars portrayed the teachings as a nihilistic phenomenon. This drew the dire need to produce scholars to counter such false opinions. That need was fulfilled by many scholars, both lay and monk, subsequently generating an interesting platform full of debates and logical discourses.
Most Venerable Davuldena Gnanissara Theras birth comes to pass in such a backdrop. In 1915, Ceylon was yet to fall free of the English rule, albeit with a rich religious discourse taking place.
He enters the monkhood at an unimaginably young age of 13 and reaches the pinnacle of institutional eminence as well as spiritual fame.
Hagiography is not quite a novel concept  unlike the term itself - to Sri Lanka, a land in which the writings of saints are found in abundance. That was not an uncommon phenomenon especially with its cultural background enriched by Buddhism. A comprehensive account of Most Venerable Davuldena Gnanissara Thera could be added to this impressively massive pile of the hagiographies.
Buddhist order
In Sri Lanka, the Buddhist order is instituted into three major sects: Siam sector (initiated in 1753), Amarapura Sect (initiated in 1803) and Ramanna Sect (initiated in 1864. The Mahanayaka legacy commences with the revival of the Sri Lankan edition of Upasampada in 1753. The Upasampada is Pali for consummating the traditions of a monk. A layperson, mostly regardless of his age, enters the Sangha Order as a novice monk, and is entrusted with certain duties before he is considered eligible for Upasampada. However, the minimum age requirement for the Upasampada is 20. The Upasampada calls for a ceremonious celebration, traditionally. The appointment of a Sangha senior to the Mahanayaka position commenced with the revival of Upasampada tradition. The Mahanayakas of all chapters are highly revered in Sri Lanka.
Genuine honour and fear-filled respect could seem strange allies. Most Venerable Gnanissara Thera, who held the position of Amarapura Chapters Mahanayaka Thera, had earned quite a respect genuinely drawn from his brethren, both contemporary as well as the juniors. He had been hailed as an exemplary leader of the Sangha community.
He was a novice monk under the tutelage of Venerable Dr Umale Piyarathana Thera. Why he has earned respect among his contemporaries could be an interesting factor. Most Venerable Davuldena Gnanissara Thera had been praised for his academic prowess, particularly in Sanskrit.
Most Venerable Tirikunamale Ananda Mahanayaka Thera, the chief incumbent of Sri Vajiraramaya, identifies rare characteristics in Most Venerable Gnanissara Thera: self-restraint conduct, perseverance, perfect virtue and the remarkable command of the Buddhas teachings.
Humbleness and respect for teachers
The Thera is descendent of Monarawila Keppetipola Thera who shouldered the Uva-Wellassa rebellion. Most Venerable Ananda Thera links the religious fervour in the family to the late Mahanayaka Theras interest in joining the Sangha Order at such an early age, and the subsequent ability to sustain it until the passing away.
During his tutelage at the Vidyodaya Pirivena, Most Venerable Gnanissara Thera secured the Samaraja prize reserved for the brightest student of that institute. Most Venerable Tirikunamale Ananda Thera recalls how the late Mahanayaka Thera offered advice to his peers at the institute. Whether you are a lay or a monk, you have a responsibility as a student. Your main responsibility is to study properly without being lazy. Humbleness and respect for teachers are two core concepts that lead to your success.
Most Venerable Tirkunamale Ananda Thera recalls the days the late Mahanayaka Thera spent at the Vajiragnana Dharmayathana, Maharagama, as Sanskrit lecturer. When he questions a student, the late Mahanayaka Thera would not forget to take out a small watch from his inner pocket and say: this gift to the one who gives the right answer When a student comes up with the right answer, he would add: Well, I didnt say that I would give this to anyone, and would tuck it back inside the pocket. He had that amazing witty feature, with which he conversed easily.
The late Mahanayaka Thera offered his service as head of the Tripitaka Compilation Board attached to Department of Buddhist Affairs. Even at 100, he wasted no time. With his impressive command of Sanskrit, the Most Venerable Thera used to compose a verse or two. He was the living example of the ancient Sanskrit aphorism that scholars have time only for intellectual leisure.
With all such credit under him, the late Mahanayaka Thera was still a humble human being to anyone in his surrounding. Most Ven Tirikunamale Ananda Thera compares him with Sariputta Thera who is known to be the humblest among the Buddhas disciples.
Like any other noble saint, Most Venerable Davuldena Gnanissara Thera left an example to be followed.
He held the most prestigious position in Buddhist monk order, yet he did not digress from the Noble Path. One can confidently say that he lived a spiritually perfect life.
His lifespan itself is ample evidence in an age where life expectancy is becoming a serious subject despite the availability of the most sophisticated medicine on earth.
Unforgettable legend
ANIL WEERASINGHE
The Most Venerable Davuldena Gnanissara Thera has just crossed the great divide. Let us wish the renowned priest the bliss of Nibbana. The birth of this great priest was on December 31, 1915. Ceylon had just experienced riots where many National leaders were jailed by the British. In the international scene, a needless war (World War I) was on. The great Empires of Austria, Hungary, Britain, Germany and Russia were still very much intact. These Empires went to war expecting to extend their boundaries but at the end becoming great losers. In Austria, Emperor Franz Josef was in the 67th year of his reign in the great Schonbrunn Palace in Vienna. In Germany, the impulsive Kaiser Welhelm II was ruling more as a warlord (he was a grandson of Queen Victoria). In England the very down to earth George V was on the throne (he was another grandson of Queen Victoria).
Last but not the least the tragic Emperor Nicholas II was in the last couple of years of his reign. All the Empires except the British collapsed by the end of the Great War. The air plane was still in its infancy. Computer was not known to the world. In Ceylon almost 80 percent of land area was still jungle. Freedom to Ceylon was only a piped dream. To this lost world, came in this erudite monk. He has departed in an era what one would call a computer-rich era and mankind looking to colonize other planets!

Unique spaces
We need spaces for meditation. We need spaces that will soothe us- spaces that will refresh and calm us., spaces that will elevate us to a consciousness where we are completely detached from the worries in life. ArchWorld speaks to Archt. (Major) Chintaka Kanchana Nikapitiya on spaces created for calmness.
Continuous dialogue with nature, casting shadows with sunlight, cascading water bodies, and reflecting ponds will relax your mind. Better to keep the internal space cool and maintain more indoor comfort levels with continuous cross ventilation, said Nikapitiya
We need to feel refreshed, after we come out of a world largely demanding. And lets face it commuting in Sri Lanka is not devoid of dust and grime. We need to come back to coolness, comfort and solitude.
Sustainable design approach, and by adopting passive design strategies we may be able to utilize maximum natural sunlight & wind, stated Nikapitiya.
Colors are incredibly effective when we want to create an effect. From a variety of colors we can use the most suitable colors to create that sense of elevation. That sense of transcendence.
This may differ from project to project and depend on the clients preference. Personally I prefer to go with earth color tones with variety. Always I work very closely with the client in color selection, pointed out Nikapitiya.
In our home we have to be totally and absolutely in control. Our home is our kingdom. We can use so many methods to create a feeling of wholeness
Sounds of birds, sound of cascading water will relax a persons mind. Internal court yards with water features, creating spaces and link with gardens will do this, explained Nikapitiya.
Artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence is the next new step in science. It is the next big dream where life is made simpler due to the service of computers.
Computers will not be able to take Architects Place. Concept or Philosophy behind any architectural work has to come from the human/architects mind. Computer is a machine /tool which will support the architect to express his thinking more effectively and accurately. Computer is a very effective tool to analyze more complex situations, models and give projections using available data, added Nikapitiya
We live in a consumerist culture. And therefore there are so many distractions. However an Architect through experience knows exactly what is needed and so can guide the client into what is necessary.
I think rest, relaxation, belonging, identity, security are basic needs of a person. Hiring an architect is a symbolic and prestigious thing for a person, which is one reason that people hire an architect without doing the job themselves. Of course there are other reasons for hiring an architect, the main reason being expertise and a job excellently done. The architect will provide the solution for the deeper needs of a human, explained
NikapitiyaLifespan
Everything has a lifespan. We have a lifespan and our creations have a lifespan. Life is largely transient.
Every building has a life span, Life cycle. We have to design buildings considering the life cycle factor of each element of the building. However the concept behind a creation may timeless, informed Nikapitiya
The contents of the mind have been perused by the architect. He has the experience and he knows the ways of the client.
We have been trained to understand the clients mind. In the discussion we can gather information about the real need for a particular client. So we can come out with design options with 3d visuals, Models, Animations, Walk-Throughs, & stimulations, which the client can decide before building physically at site, shared Nikapitiya
Truly the joy of creation can only be realized when you hire an architect. He is the grandmaster of the design. The understanding that passes through the client and the architect is intrinsic to the design.
Designing is a problem solving exercise. Each problem has a specific solution. A creation has to be unique. Solution has to be very simple. Less Is More Live /design more close with nature within logical /practical parameters will always bring joy, comfort & satisfaction to ones mind, pointed out Nikapitiya.
Unique language
Designing in the tropics gives an architect his own unique language. This language translates into a design.
My designs revolve around long eves, verandahs for relaxation. Large volumes of spaces, maximize natural light and ventilation. Flexible & multi-functional spaces, court yards, spaces which link to external & internal gardens. Green terraces & vertical gardens are some key features and elements in domestic scale designs. Yes, its time to think and implement in a sensible way without destroying Sri Lankan uniqueness, added Nikapitiya
Nikapitiya enjoys his architecture. He especially enjoys spaces that add more value to the clients aspirations. Every creation is unique because it involves its own set of challenges.
Yes, I really enjoy it. Its a unique feeling that comes to ones mind in relation to a character of a particular space. Character/ Language of the space or sequence of spaces may depend on the scale, volume, color, texture. Solutions involve designing climatic responsive buildings. More sustainable building structures would be the solution, summed up Nikapitiya .

All world LRT operators express interest in WP light rails
Almost all the worlds leading Light rail (LRT) operators in the world have responded to Expressions of Interests (EOI) called by Sri Lanka to build five light rail corridors in the Western Province.
Megapolis Development Minister Champika Ranawaka told the media at Waters Edge that it was pleasing to note that they received 39 EOI applications from USA, China, Korea, Japan, Germany, UK and other countries to build these five corridors.
He said that one of the unique features of this project would be that the government will not spend a single cent towards these projects as they would be on a Private Public Partnership basis where the operator will build and maintain this for a certain period.
The Minister said they have decided to do away with the mono rail system and will adopt the LRT model.The first leg of the project will be implemented with Japanese aid and the project will cost US$ 6,000 million .
The Minister also said that the rail electrification process too will be done from Veyangoda to Panadura. However I must say that as a Sri Lankan I am sad to note that this project was first suggested by renowned engineer D. J.Wimalasurendra who was the father of hydro power inSri Lanka.

Around 110 Acts that run contrary to RTI need to be amended  Dr. Kalansooriya
Close to 110 Acts identified thus far have clauses that are contrary to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, Director General (DG) of the Department of Government Information Dr. Ranga Kalansooriya said yesterday.
All these acts will need to be amended as the RTI supersedes all such acts, he added.
The Act which came into effect on 4 February 2017, has had certain issues in its implementation.
The DG addressing the weekly Cabinet press at the Parliamentary Complex explained that a special team at the Ministry of Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs was looking into the issues.
One such issue highlighted was the payment for certain information. Certain government agencies specify that a sum of up to Rs.2,000
needs to be paid for information.
People brought this to our notice and complained that this was an obstacle when speaking of freedom of information, he said.
The Act at present also states that no changes would be made to the price structure for information in government agencies.
This is a new process for the people and our officials, but we do see a surge in interest among the people with the Act, Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said.

Aung San Suu Kyi: No ethnic cleansing of Myanmar Muslim minority

Aung San Suu Kyi has denied there is ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, despite widespread reports of abuses.
In an exclusive interview with the BBC, the Nobel peace prize winner acknowledged problems in Rakhine state, where most Rohingya people live.
But she said ethnic cleansing was "too strong" a term to use.
Instead, Myanmar's de-facto leader said the country would welcome any returning Rohingya with open arms.
"I don't think there is ethnic cleansing going on. I think ethnic cleansing is too strong an expression to use for what is happening," she said.
Suu Kyi added: "I think there is a lot of hostility there - it is Muslims killing Muslims as well, if they think they are co-operating with the authorities.
"It is not just a matter of ethnic cleansing as you put it - it is a matter of people on different sides of the divide, and this divide we are trying to close up."
The Rohingya are denied citizenship in Myanmar, also known as Burma, which views them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. They face routine official and public discrimination.
Tens of thousands of Rohingya live in make-shift refugee camps after being displaced by communal violence in 2012.
In recent months, some 70,000 have fled to Bangladesh to escape a government military operation in Rakhine, launched after nine policemen were killed in an attack.
The United Nations announced last month it wasto conduct an investigationinto allegations the military has been indiscriminately targeting the Rohingya during the operation, subjecting them to rape, murder and torture. The government has denied this.
For many, Suu Kyi's perceived silence on the Rohingya has damaged the reputation she earned as a beacon for human rights, thanks to her decades-long battle against the military junta, during much of which she was under house arrest.
She has come under increasing pressure internationally on the issue.
But speaking in a face-to-face interview for the first time this year, Suu Kyi said had answered questions on the issue previously.
"This question has been asked since 2013, when the last round of troubles broke out in Rakhine.
"And they [the journalists] would ask me questions and I would answer them and people would say I said nothing.
"Simply because I did not make the statements people wanted, which people wanted me to make, simply to condemn one community or the other."
Suu Kyi said she had no idea why the October attacks were carried out, but speculated it may have been an effort to derailattempts to negotiate peace between the Myanmar state and the country's various armed ethnic insurgent groups.
She also denied the army had free rein to do whatever it liked.
"They are not free to rape, pillage and torture," she said. "They are free to go in and fight. That is in the constitution. Military matters are to be left to the army."
However, she did acknowledge that regaining control of the military was something the government still hoped to do. Under the current constitution, the military operates independently of the governing party.
I meet her in Nay Pyi Daw, a relic of the absurdity and paranoia of military rule, a capital marooned far from the people, designed to keep the generals safe but where the new democratic government is now trying to consolidate a hold on power.
I first interviewed Aung San Suu Kyi more than two decades ago on her release from the first period of house arrest in July 1995. Since then I have followed her progress through renewed house arrest, military crackdowns and then the triumph of democratic elections last year.
The atmosphere when we met was friendly. She discussed her government's achievements but refused absolutely to accept that the Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state were the victims of ethnic cleansing.
These days she is wary of the international media, disdainful of her international critics, far more the steely politician than the global icon feted from capital to capital when she was released seven years ago.
Suu Kyi also defended the progress her government had made since sweeping to power in March last year.
The number one priority - creating jobs - had been helped by investment into roads, bridges and bringing electricity to communities. Healthcare has also improved, and more free elections have been held.
Other priorities included creating a peace in a country which has almost continuously been in a state of civil war.
And then there was discussion of giving citizenship to those who had been denied it under the military junta - like the Rohingya.
As for those Rohingya who have fled Myanmar to neighbouring countries, Suu Kyi said: "If they come back they will be safe. It is up for them to decide, some have come back.
"We welcome them and we will welcome them back."

Bangladesh looking to give fitting farewell to Mortaza
A national captain who disliked T20 cricket:
Bangladesh who lost the first T20 International to Sri Lanka on Tuesday will be looking to turn things around in the second game at the R Premadasa Stadium today and give their retiring captain from T20 cricket Mashrafe Mortaza a fitting farewell.
If Bangladesh can do that they will level the two-match series one-all and leave the shores of Sri Lanka with their heads held high having drawn all three series with the hosts  Tests, ODIs and T20Is.
Prior to the start of the Tuesdays match Mortaza, the 33-year-old captain who has led his country in 27 T20 Internationals announced that he would retire from the shortest format at the end of the series.
The decision I took is because I think if you look at our fast bowlers like Rubel Hossain is not in the side. He got seven wickets in the last two T20 matches. It hurts me to see that he is not playing for me, said Mortaza.
It is always tough to hang up your jersey. But I thought that if I look behind me, someone like Rubel is missing. He should have been in the first XI, but he is missing out because of me. Since he is performing better than me, he should be in the team. This is the time to grow our youngsters, those who can play T20s and become prepared for the bigger stages like Tests and ODIs, he said.
At a time when T20 cricket is the norm and every cricketer is trying to cash in on it for the riches it offers, Mortaza is one rare character who dislikes this format although he represented his country in 53 T20 internationals over a 11-year period.
I never enjoyed that format when T20 started. I played five World Cups but I never enjoyed it maybe because of my injuries, said Mortaza.
This format is quick and sharp so you dont get enough chances to warm up your body, especially my legs which hurt a lot. I still kept going because the cricket board was respecting me as a captain. I still enjoy ODIs, but I never really enjoyed T20s.
But when the cricket board made me a captain, I wanted to build this team. I dont know how much I was able to. It is a huge honour to be the captain of Bangladeshs T20 captain. I dont think I can ask for anything more. Perhaps it was a sudden decision. But I didnt think anything too big behind this. I didnt think too much about it. I felt that I didnt want to play T20s, he said.
I am not thinking about [quitting ODIs] at this moment. I dont plan many things, but this was a tough decision. A lot of people are involved in such a decision, like my family, friends, teammates and the media. It was the same  taking it today or two days later. If I am fit, I will keep playing ODIs and next time when I decide to retire, I will tell everyone and then leave.
Sri Lanka has won the two bilateral T20I series played between the two countries in 2013 (1-0) and 2014 (2-0). Overall Bangladesh has just a solitary win and five losses in six matches.

Beauty bound!
For her, beauty is not a stranger at all. Born and groomed in a world of splendor, beauty became her passion. Not only gifted in beauty but also equipped with intellect she is now the creator of many beautiful and good looking women in the country. The Daily News spoke to Dr. Shanika Arsecularatne, who is striving to make the people she meet feel beautiful.
"We are concerned in making people looking their best. In Sri Lanka some people think the anti aging treatments are harmful and a may be risky. But it isn't so. You don't have to be exceptionally good looking or born with perfect features to carry out yourself. You can look good and confidently carry yourself out in the society with a few simple things," She said. "Unfortunately at present there is a lack of personnel to give proper advice to people on these procedures. People should have a proper person to guide them. Just applying a cream for a problem beneath the skin is not the remedy and it won't help in the long run of looking good.
Taking forward the legacy of her mother, Professor Ramani Arsecularatne, Dr Shanika Arsecularatne is determined to serve the ever-increasing clientele for standardized Aesthetic Skin and Hair treatments. "I was always associated with beauty. It was something that I grew up with. Then I discovered my passion for Aesthetic Medicine and pursued my studies in that area. I am happy that I can combine both my passions and make people to look better," she said.
Youngest in Sri Lanka
Dr. Arsecularatne is the youngest in Sri Lanka to have obtained the post Graduate Diploma by the American Academy of Aesthetic Medicine.
"Aesthetic Medicine promotes the association between health and beauty. At the clinic we tackle many skin and hair diseases by combining the newest medical technologies ranging from non-surgical correction involving lasers, chemical resurfacing to surgical scar revision. Some issues even stretch marks that many think cannot be treated or corrected can be made right although people are not aware of it," she added.
"Almost every person in today's society is qualified. Most of them have degrees and are equipped with professional qualifications. According to research those who make the extra effort to present themselves better, find it more easier to make better first impressions, engage in discussions better and reach the top of the corporate ladder ,simply because when you look good, you feel good and that makes you perform better. That is where we come in to serve and give people more confidence. A health or a physical issue should not be a hindrance to your career," Dr. Arsecularatne said.
"Every one that comes to me for advanced skin treatment is important for me. They are comprehensively advised on the procedure and results, throughout the process of treatments. We are always geared to deliver our clients a quality service with the results they look for," she added.
Strength
Looking back she says her mother was her strength in every step she took in life. Professor Ramani Arsecularatne, a renowned cosmetologist and founder of Ramani Arsecularatne International Academy of Cosmetology (RAIAC) has paved the way for many new entrants to the Sri Lankan hair and beauty industry. Receiving a profound education in internationally reputed institutions in the United States of America, United Kingdom, France and Japan, she is a graduate of the Christine Valmy Institute-New York and Kimari International-Singapore and is the first Sri Lankan to have obtained a degree in the field of beauty and hairdressing.
With her expertise she has being an asset to the industry. Her vision of introducing the latest industry innovations to the country and helping people to build up their levels of confidence by looking their best is now intertwined with her daughter's dreams. "It gives me immense pleasure and satisfaction to help another person look well and boost their confidence. I am dedicated to bring in whatever new innovations that comes up in the industry in the future," she said.

Bertie Wijesinha  legend of legends
Bertie Wijesinha is a Legend who is loved, an Icon who is admired and a Hero who inspires. And this May 24, he is 97 years old, 3 years short of the Century that he wanted us to aspire for on the crease. I know because as he was my Coach at school, a journalist as we covered cricket, a super commentator as we tune into our radios, and a classy Gentleman in the true sense of the word.
This package is so rare to find. Bertie is an all rounder. not only in cricket but many other aspects of sports and life.
Above all he is an All-rounder-- a man of many parts. He was a cricketer, athlete, coach, teacher, journalist, commentator and mentor. Those who came under his influence, as I did, must count ourselves fortunate as he added so much value, and set standards, in our lives as sportiness. He sported the blue, black and blue colors of S.Thomas College, on the Mount in 1936 and had his education there till 1939 where in addition to his excellence in books he also shone in cricket and athletics.
It was in cricket that WIJESINHA really blossomed and excelled. He was lucky to come under the tutelage of that former Trinity cricketing great who was the STCML coach at that time who taught the basics to him when he was just 9 years old. It did not take long for John Hallangoda to spot WIJESINHA as a champion in the making and teach him how to play the game according to that treasured adage with a  straight bat- which adage WIJESINHA carried through his 97 years and imbibed this in all who were fortunate to come under his wings including this writer.
Possessed wrists of steel
WIJESINHA was strongly built and possessed wrists of steel. He was a medium pace bowler who had the ability to cut the ball both ways, hard hitting stylish right hand batsman and brilliant fielder in any position. The Battle of the Blues the cricketing derby between S.Thomas and Royal College was the yearning of any cricketer in the two schools to play in, celebrated its 138th game a few weeks ago and WIJESINHA who was an outstanding all rounder made his dream debut for STCML playing in four of the Derbys in 1936, 37, 38 and 39.
WIJESINHA immediately served notice of his brilliance when in the first Derby under the captaincy of Donald Fairweather, he came to the rescue of the Thomians with a 136 run stand for the 7th wicket with Norman Siebel when his side was on the ropes at 65 for 6. WIJESINHA made a gallant 57 and Siebel went on to make an unbeaten 137. In the following year he steered his school to victory returning figures of 3 for 33 and 5 for 67 and scoring 55. He captained the Thomian team that won the 1939 match by 5 wickets. He crowned his outstanding school career with an unbeaten double hundred- 235- and also having the distinction of bagging a hat trick against my old school St.Benedicts College, Kotahena.
After an outstanding school cricket career he joined the Sinhalese Sports Club and gave continuity to his brilliance and saw his extraordinary prowess and stature grow with telling performances for his club which are too numerous to mention and it was not long when national honours came his way. And when it did come it would have been memorable and great joy to him. Some of his team mates at the SSC were F.C.de Saram, Sargo Jayawickrema, D.S. Jayasundera, Mahes Rodrigo, Ben Navaratne, Lucien de Zoysa, C.Ivers Gunesekera and Robert Senanayake.
National debut in 1949
WIJESINHA made his national debut in 1949 against Pakistan at the Oval and facing Fazal and Khan Mohomed he made a plucky 29. Later up against the frightening pace of Prior Jones and John Trim of the Windies he made 22. Although the scores were paltry, yet that he stood up to these four pacemen when other batsmen cringed was what was to be admired. After he called finis to his playing career he took to coaching. First was his Alma Mater STC and three cricketers he coached who went places and represented the country were Vernon Prins, known as the Prince of captains when he captained the country, C.T.A. Schafter a medium pace bowler with an action which was poetry in motion and K.M.T. Perera. Incidentally Schafter was my captain at the Tamil Union when I was playing there as a schoolboy.
WIJESINHSA also coached the Ceylon team that took part in the first World Cup.
St. Benedicts College struck gold when under the Directorship of that keen sports promoter Rev.Bro.Alban and P.Gnanapragasam, Prefect of Games they signed on WIJESINHA to coach its cricketers from 1959. He first coached the team under Lionel Fernando, 1960 under Elmo Rodrigopulle, 61 under Sanath Jayawardena, 62 under Ranjit Fernando,63 under Quintus Perera and it was in 1964 under Sunil Fernando,'65 and '66 Felix Dias. It was under Sunil that the Bens enjoyed their best year emerging inter-school cricket champions and what made all Bens proud was that under WIJESINHAs coaching that the Kotahena school beat arch rival St. Josephs College after 47 years. As a coach he would teach cricketers to adapt to situations.
Some of his products from SBC who made it big playing for the country were Ranjit Fernando who also played in the first World Cup in 1975 in England, Lionel Fernando against West Indies and Cyril Ernest against Colin Cowdreys Englishmen. Ernest is a leading Cardiologist in LA and also Ranjan Goonetilleke. Those who played for the Board Presidents X1 were Elmo Rodrigopulle, Nihal Zoysa, Sunil Fernando, Joe Saverymuthapulle. Ranjit Fernando has served in the countrys administration in many departments for long and still does for the sake of the game.
Sangakkara his prized pupil
When WIJESINHA coached Trinity the best to emerge was Kumar Sangakkara a wicket keeper batsman who took the cricket world by storm during his reign captaining the country and among the 100s and double hundreds he made, the four centuries he made in the previous World Cup in Australia and New Zealand will not easily be equaled or surpassed. WIJESINHA also showed how to Lord Sid Wettimuny who scored a magnificent 190 at Lords.
WIJESINHA married DOROTHY the beautiful daughter of Everad Weerakoon who was popularly called Bobby and who excelled as a horse racing commentator in the very early 1950s. A little anecdote. When I was a 10 year old, I used to be glued to Redifusion listening to Weerakoon describing that famous champion horse COTTON HALL ridden by TED FORDYCE who was the champion jockey at that time winning races. My mother noticing this came up and gave me a thundering slap and that ended my interest in horse racing and the Redifusion stayed silent every time or day there was horse racing. Dorothy was secretary to the chairman when I was Sports Desk at the Times of Ceylon.
WIJESINHA also teamed up with his SSC team mate Lucien de Zoysa and did a grand job as radio commentators describing vividly the happenings out in the middle. WIJESINHA was also Sports Editor of the Ceylon Observer. He captained a Press X1 that played the State Bank of India during the twilight of his career team led by Ajit Wadekar which team also had players of the caliber of Hanumant Singh who made a debut 100 against England, dashing opener Buddhi Kunderam, Vijaya Mehra, Ramesh Saxena and G. Goswami among others. The game was played at the NCC ground and the visitors made 260 for 4 dec. with Mehra making 39, Kunderam 41, Wadekar 45, Hanumant 62, Saxena 36 and Goswami 29 both unbeaten.
The Press X1 lost their first 3 wickets for no runs, the 4th at 10 and the 5th at 40. Heres how the Daily Mirror described the action in a headline titled Press provides limb-loosener, its writer said: A master-pupil combination of Bertie Wijesinha 60 (7 fours) and Elmo Rodrigopulle 24 (2 fours) with a stand of 58 for the 6th wicket helped the Press X1 reach a respectable score of 132. Berties innings will long be remembered for the nonchalance in adversity and aggressiveness in the face of defeat. Wijesinha is a unique Legend and will leave behind a rich legacy of a sportsman and Gentleman par excellence.

Cabinet Decisions
Government local office costs of UN Development Programme
UNDP works closely with Sri Lanka since 1967. Sri Lanka contributes USD 150,000 as the combined voluntary subscription and USD 39500 as expenses for UNDP office. As Sri Lanka was classified as a middle income country in 2014 from a low middle income country, Sri Lanka should have settled a due of USD 1.182 million on 31-12-2016. The proposal made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to implement the proposal made by UNDP to implement identified development programmes using that money instead of repaying the due amount, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

CMTA concerned over vehicle assembling scams
The Ceylon Motor Traders Association (CMTA) said it is concerned over the recent decision by the government to allow assembling of motor vehicles locally by using imported used spare parts.
This move, the Association representing manufacturers of global automobile brands in Sri Lanka says will jeopardise the safety of motorists and also contravenes an existing Customs regulation, which only permits the import of vehicles that has been used upto a maximum of three years, from the date of first registration.
The move also contradicts the Governments policy,which encourages the re-export of motor vehicles that has been used for a period of maximum of five years in Sri Lanka to reduce environmental impact.
The danger of allowing this to go ahead is that the unsuspecting motor vehicle buyer will not know the year of manufacture of these so-called assembled vehicles and a car manufactured ten years ago can be issued with the latest registration number plates from the RMV.
A ten year old car will also not have the relevant spare parts necessary for repairs and maintenance of a vehicle as the guarantee of spare parts from the manufacturer is for only valid between 10 to 15 years from the date of manufacture.
In the event of a major accident, the Engine number and the Chassis number would not be able to be related to manufacturers records, thereby even causing security concerns. The status of registration will also be ambiguous and will cause further complications legally.
The Association also believes such a move would create environmental and safety issues and also contradicts the governments long-term policy of standardising vehicles with brand-new vehicle imports.
Any decision taken in extending the life of obsolete vehicles assembled from used spare parts could be a strain on the countrys balance sheet. The CMTA requests the intervention of President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister to take appropriate action to rectify the issue.

A college beyond definition
The recurrent debate about the purpose and role of art has been addressed in a multiplicity of ways. And rather than refute opposing views, it is more fruitful to embrace diversity as was done at an exhibition of drawings and paintings by five artists who refreshingly displayed a variety of styles and perspectives at the J.D.A Perera Gallery on March 4 and 5.
From an exploration of the human condition, the intricate links between martial arts and a simple need to purge oneself of a deep seated need to draw, the symphony of artistic creations were artfully curated. Viewers were made aware of the apparent differences but were also given a sense that unity can be achieved through diversity.
Impeccably recreated
Finely detailed Royden Gibbs reimagined city scapes and historical sites seem to challenge time itself. In a world where cities undergo development and unavoidable changes, the precision Gibbs achieves in his sketches such as that of the Colombo Habour - 2016 and the Dambadeniya Rajamaha Vihara were visually calming and near-perfect. Added to his exhibits were also moments in the wild which were equally well portrayed.
Abstractions
For Gunadasa Wathuwelagedara each exhibit was born of an unstoppable urge to create. Also, intriguingly all Wathuwelagedaras exhibits were untitled. A riot of colour, an amalgamation of textures and interesting figures served as a window to the artists mind. Sombre at times, what was most interesting were the distorted, human-looking figures. Among many remarkable drawings, one that piqued my interest was that of two wide-eyed figures huddled under a blanket, enveloped in darkness and a moonlit sky. Are they migrants or a family seeking refuge from the horrors of the night The beauty of Wathuwelagedaras exhibits was their ability to raise myriad questions.
A Mortal Combat
In exploring the roots of martial arts, Amaresh Pereira also delves into the depths of the human soul. His observations are captured with fierce intensity on canvas.
The tremendous hood of a cobra and a fearless dancer fuse together in Caging the dragon. Its fusion signifies the intricate links between martial arts and other art forms that originated in the South East Asian and South Asian region. Conceptually brilliant, all Amaresh Pereiras creations explore histories he hungered to understand. Exceptional among his exhibits were Fire& Ice (In between) and Fire& Ice (The Awakening). While the former was an outstanding representation of darkness and light cohabiting sometimes uneasily within the human soul, the latter signified a realization of the parallels that seemed to result in an awakening.
I found that Pereiras explorations of the deeply personal helped create thought-provoking works of art.
Beauty in the Mundane
Beauty reveals itself in moments that go unnoticed by many except a few. A rush of colour and flamboyance highlighted Noeline Fernandos exhibits. Immersed in capturing social settings, scenery and people that would conventionally be categorized as ordinary, Fernandos artistic re-interpretations lent them deeper meaning. Women in Arippu, Grieving and Ariya with Araliya had a special charm that explored beauty in the simplest and most authentic forms. The creations were indicative of the intuitiveness of the artist.
Membered - Dismembered
Engaging with Michael Anthoniszs creations meant deconstructing contradictory representations. While Anthonisz is a master at capturing the female form realistically, the artist also endeavored to dismember and understand the transience of a beauty that is traditionally portrayed as everlasting.
While Seated Woman and Three Women Seated captured my interest, The Future of Statues had layers of meaning. Anthonisz very rightly questions modern, distorted portrayals of the female body.
As I stood at the entrance to the J.D.A Perera gallery, both enlightened and intrigued by an array of artistic creations, I understood why the artists chose not to give the exhibition a title. It was a collage that was beyond definition and naming.

Condolence messages: passing away of the Amarapura Chapter Chief Prelate Most Venerable Davuldena Gnanissara Thera
Archbishop of Colombo, His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith
The Mahanayake of the Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya, Most Ven. Davuldena Gnanissara Thera rendered an unparalleled service to the Buddha Sasanaya.
His services to the nation and the Buddha Sasanaya is commendable.
His service for the upliftment of spiritual well being of the people is laudable.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe
The Most Ven. Davuldena Gnanissara Thera with comprehensive knowledge of the Dhamma illuminated the Buddha Sasana. The Mahanayake Thera who rendered a yeoman service for the upliftment of Buddhism in the country, was conferred with titles of Sanskruthika Chakravarthi, Grantha Visharada, Dwi Bhasha Visharada, Sanskrutha Sahithya Saraswathie and shad Bhasha Parameshwara.
The Mahanayake Thera, who was fluent in Sinhala, Pali and Sanskrit languages, used his broad knowledge and abundant communication skills to spread Buddhism around the world.
Most Ven. Davuldena Gnanissara Thera was born in Davuldena in Uva Paranagama in the Uva province on December 30, 1915 and was ordained as a novice monk during his childhood.
May the Mahanayake of the Amarapura Maha Nikaya Most Ven. Davuldena Gnanissara Thera who spent his life to render the most valued and selfless service to the Buddha Shasana, attain the ultimate bliss of Nibbana.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake
There is no argument that the late Amarapura Nikaya Agga Maha Panditha, linguist, Most Ven. Davuldena Gnanissara Thera, as a disciple of The Buddha, made his full commitments for the propagation and nourishment of the Buddha Sasanaya for nearly a century.
The late Maha Nayake Thera who was born in 1915 in a restive difficult village Davuldena in Uva Paranagama was ordained as a novice monk when he was 12.
Late Davuldena Maha Nayake Theras exemplary life leading up to 90 years as a Bhikkhu, teaches all monks and laymen the disciplines one should adhere to, such as a sapling growing to become magnificent tree.
Going by the teachings of the Buddha, the late Nayake Thera relinquished everything to prove the universal truth of impermanence. But, as a laymen, we are unable to bear the grief of his departure with equanimity.
However, none of us are mightier than the command of nature. What we can do now is to follow the footsteps of the great monk and make all possible commitments for the upliftment of the Buddha Sasana. Therefore, I believe it is the highest honour we can confer on the name of the late Nayake Thera.
The Chief Prelate of the Amarapura Nikaya, Agga Maha Panditha, the Most Venerable Davuldena Gnanissara Thera, May you attain Nibbana!
Sri Lankarama monastery, Brisbane
Over the past week in Australia, it is with great Samvega that we have mourned the passing away of a father in the Order and a long standing beacon of Buddha Sasana to the Theravada Buddhist world from our mother land, Sri Lanka.
Aggamahapandita Most Ven. Davuldena Gnanissara Maha Nayaka Thero was the genuine embodiment of the term Sakya Putta a noble son of the Lord Buddha who comes in once every few decades to make an indelible mark on society and the world at large.
The Maha Nayaka Thero in his background, academia and personal achievement, presents a type of character and personality which is among the finest we can recognize in the recent history of Buddha Sasana in Sri Lanka. An erudite scholar who is intelligent, wise, and capable of good command over Sangha and Sasana matters, which was always coloured with his down to earth humble demeanour that earned his mark of respect among the fellow members of the Sangha as well as the society. Because of his thoroughness in purity and undisputed record as a monastic and good grounding in meditation matters, he ought to have lived the holiest of lives in this degenerate era, leaving an enormous vacuum in the lineage of the Lord Buddha for many years to come.
At this moment of grief, we also like to acknowledge the yeoman service that the Maha Nayaka Thero has done to the propagation of Buddha Sasana in Australia. We were very fortunate to have had the Maha Nayaka Thero visiting our temple in 2010 to chair the Katina Ceremony that year. Following the event, Maha Nayaka Thero left an unceasing mark in Australia and the world by consecrating the Sima Malaka at Sri Lankarama Buddhist Monastery in Brisbane, allowing new ordinations and higher ordinations to take place in this foreign country.
Whether it is the death of a Monk or others, it is inevitable. Death separates us. When the Maha Nayaka Thero is leaving us with that message after a life well lived, we wish he attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana!

Death,  fear thou not!
The political antics of Wimal Weerawansa, who staged a so-called fast unto death in prison continued to grab political headlines last week but, in the end, left the leader of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP) worse off as he was refused bail and re-remanded on Monday.
Weerawansa is languishing in remand prison facing charges of misappropriating over 40 state vehicles while he was Minister of Housing in the government headed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He is alleged to have distributed these vehicles among family, friends and party workers, thus abusing his position as a minister.
Whatever his faults as a politician, Weerawansa has a knack for news. It was only recently that he grabbed headlines declaring that he was withdrawing from the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA). As such, he argued before Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in Parliament, he was entitled to the privileges of a party leader.
This was not unfamiliar territory for Speaker Jayasuriya, who is doing an excellent job of work as the arbiter of such disputes. Several months ago, the Joint Opposition (JO) faction of the UPFA made the same demand. They said they were a distinct group within the UPFA parliamentary group and had a right to be recognised as such.
Extra parliamentary privileges
The JO group went even further and demanded that they be allowed to choose the Leader of the Opposition as their grouping- numbering 51- was greater than the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). In adjudicating this request, Speaker Jayasuriya confirmed what many analysts had acknowledged already: those elected under the UPFA could have only one leader of its parliamentary group.
Citing the same reason, Speaker Jayasuriya declined Weerawansas request to be recognised as a party leader. Thus his hopes of having extra parliamentary privileges were dashed. It was abundantly clear that, apart from enjoying these privileges, Weerawansa had no intention of parting ways with the JO faction of the UPFA- in fact, he was working very much in concert with them.
Hot on the heels of this episode came the fast unto death drama at Welikada. Weerawansa was protesting the decision not to grant him bail and claiming that his detention was causing distress to his sixteen year old daughter, Vimasha Weerawansa who had been referred to the Lady Ridgeway Childrens Hospital in Colombo for treatment. Citing this, Weerawansa was seeking bail under exceptional circumstances.
Misappropriation ofstate property
This question brought to the fore an interesting issue. While the governments critics argue that Weerawansa is the victim of a political witch-hunt, he still has to satisfactorily counter the charges of misappropriation of state property which is a serious offence. Besides, the bail issue was at the discretion of judges who were hearing his case- and no one, not even the JO, was claiming that judges were being influenced not to grant Weerawansa bail.
Indeed, had Weerawansa been granted bail due to his protest, it would have caused even more difficulties. It had the potential to open the floodgates- each and every prisoner at Welikada could then stage a fast unto death and demand to be released on bail- surely, they could all find some exceptional circumstances to justify their actions!
It will be recalled that in recent years, two high profile parliamentarians had been jailed. Former Minister S. B. Dissanayake was jailed for contempt of the Supreme Court when it was headed by then Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva.
Weerawansa himself was very much a part and parcel of the government that jailed former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka who later went on to become a Member of Parliament. Both being outspoken men in their own individual way, they suffered their plight stoically without resorting to the antics that Weerawansa is now engaged in.
Nevertheless, there were many significant behind the scenes moves from the JO to convince Weerawansa to call off his fast. Many were wondering why his mentor, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not visit him and request him to call off the fast- as he did when Weerawansa was protesting against then United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moons decision to appoint a panel of experts to inquire into allegations of war crimes in Sri Lanka in July 2010.
Independence of judiciary
Less than three days into that fast, Rajapaksa visited Weerawansa with a glass of water opposite the United Nations office in Colombo where that drama was unfolding- and Weerawansa promptly called off his fast, saying he could not decline a request from his leader.
Rajapaksa, a veteran of many a political battle would know the hardships of being in remand prison. He too was in remand prison when his mother passed away. At the time, he was provided with special dispensation to attend his mothers funeral.
In this instance, Rajapaksa may not have intervened because that would have led to questions about his commitment to the independence of the judiciary. Nevertheless, he did speak to President Maithripala Sirisena over the issue.
A JO delegation which included Dinesh Gunawardena, Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Mahindananda Aluthgamage also met with the President to raise the same issue. President Sirisena gave them a patient hearing and, after clarifying matters with the Attorney Generals Department advised the JO that they should use legal means to try and secure bail for Weerawansa.
The JO delegation, sans Vasudeva Nanayakkara, also met with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and raised the same issue. They also met with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. While both were sympathetic, it was clear that any application for bail had to be made through the normal procedures and that the government would not interfere with the judicial process.
Meanwhile, Weerawansas physical health was declining, as he was fasting. He was moved from prison to Prison Hospital, mostly as a precautionary measure.
That was when the influential Buddhist monk and the head of the nurses trade union, Muruthettuwe Ananda thera suggested that should the Mahanayake theras appeal to Weerawansa, he may call off the fast. Acting on this advice, the JO obtained letters from the Mahanayake thera of the Ramanna Nikaya and Anunayake thera of the Malwatte Chapter.
Making a martyr of Weerawansa
They then visited Weerawansa, accompanied by a delegation of Buddhist monks who chanted pirith and offered him a glass of milk. Weerawansa then called off the fast. This was an anti-climax after the propaganda that went into making a martyr of Weerawansa- and an eerie replay of what happened in 2010, the only difference being that he was offered a glass of milk by a Buddhist monk instead of being offered a glass of water by Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The post-script to the event came on Monday, when Weerawansas lawyers submitted a fresh application for bail. This was however rejected by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
The bail application was made on the grounds of exceptional circumstances noting that Weerawansas daughter had been admitted to hospital due to a mental health condition after her father was remanded.
The Magistrate was to note that there wasnt sufficient information in the reports submitted to courts which could explain the health condition of Weerawansas daughter. A further hearing has been fixed for tomorrow (Friday) where the saga is likely to continue.
Regardless of the outcome on Friday, there appears to be a general perception among the public that the ongoing battle of wits is one staged by Weerawansa to gain more political mileage. The publicity surrounding his death fast appeared to be obviously well orchestrated as was the campaign for his release.
If Weerawansa indeed continued the fast, the public perception may have changed but his decision to meekly end the fast gives credence to the belief that this is yet another publicity stunt by the JNP leader, similar to the one he engaged in, in 2010.
In 2010 though, he could walk away from the fast, a hero in the eyes of some and a hypocrite in the eyes of others. Seven years later even if Wimal Weerawansa is eventually granted bail, he will have to deal with a greater issue: the outstanding matter of misappropriating state property.

A Digital Vision  The Way forward  for our Corporates
Data has been the fundamental building block upon which Information, Knowledge and Wisdom has been modeled however with the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution the value and importance placed upon data that resides within corporate entities and organizations in somewhat scattered silos and most often than not harvested for positive business gains in support of theirforward growth trajectories, is gaining momentum and focus and forms a tacit leave way to stay ahead in the league.
The Value of Data
Organizations that embraced the very many technology waves have spearheaded initiatives embracing best of breed technologies in terms of their adoption to mobile, smart accessories and social media constructs. However notably the data that is churned through these devices are not dwelt upon and examined to identify patterns that would aid in understanding customer behaviors, interactions or transacting patterns etc., which would provide worthy leads to identify cross selling potential in the context of enlarging upon the portfolio foot print by alternative product positioning thereby gaining in on a greater share of their purses.This is further fuelled by the age old paradigm, that it is a more costly exercise to acquire a new customer than retain an existing customer however most often than not corporate marketing initiatives tend to ignore the former and place great emphasis on the latter exerting greater pains and costs, also ignoring the successful conversion ratios and longevity of the new client acquisition and allied nurturing and maturing costs that come together with it in their drive and aspiration in search of Quick-Wins.
Thus it requires organizations and functional units to steer clear of their current operatives that take a large amount of their time in mundane routine operations and rather abstract it to a level above starting off with identifying the key measures and metrics that help latch customers on and more over keep them returning. Focusing on these measures on an ongoing basis and examining their interplay over a period of time also dwelling on past data that they have with them, will aid organizational and client serving functional units to get a better understanding and a sense of intuition for further exploitation, which would result in business growth attributing to prosperity from within their existing portfolios which undoubtedly could be significant and a less costly exercise.
In addition it would further reaffirm the bonding, trust and relationship across the existing custodian client base resulting in a greater sense of Loyalty, higher levels of Client Delight and above all brand ambassadors from within their existing portfolio/client fold in support of fuelling a PWoM Positive Word of Mouth, an indirect no-cost championing channel for organizations to dwell on.
The Digital Drive
Thus taking into consideration the fore mentioned and the value of the Data that most organizations sit pretty upon, it is a very timely imperative that a Digital Visionis created for organizations, spearheaded and sponsored right at the helm, which would aid in the creation of a Digital Culture that would foster seamless collaboration resulting in a high composure of Digital Agility over time across all quarters.
Following in on the traditional model of leaving it to an existing functional line to drive the required change, may not pay dividends given a) that the Data is pervasive and would reside across the entirety of the corporate - spanning across a wide array of functional entities and b) functional boundaries and silo-thinking within may not derive the true benefits of this initiative. Thus the installation of a Driver for this change is of utmost importance. A Chief Digital Officer(CDO) designate should be installed to ensure greater focus on this initiative reporting in onto the CEO provides the required empowerment, cutting across all organizational boundaries thus being able to gain adequate support to dissect all the silo-data scattered around. Thus the candidature fitting the bill of CDO should be versatile and wield the required acumen and exposure spanning diverse terrains thus being able to interact seamlessly by having a good understanding of the lingo of the vast multitude of functional units scattered around and for starters being able to have a trusting relationship. Thus the need of the hour is for Forward-thinking HR Leaders who will don a business savvy composure and act as a Business partner and enabler to aid in fuellingthe changes that the business units within the organizations are yearning for in this Digital Era, giving priority to the lines of business needs.Thus would follow onto institute new modes of talent acquisition, nurturing and grooming (e-learning based) to shorten ramp up cycles, assignment of digital objectives and measures and even rethinking of the stereotype annual appraisals and replacing them with year round performance based meritocracy schemes and promotional avenues that would prevent stagnation given the dynamism and agility of the business thus ensuring that the fast trackers have a way forward and not lose out on these stars due to organizational structures cast in stone. The Digital Era calls for agile and adaptable handling, which will aid in providing a suitable status quo to aid in the Digital Transformation within.
Innovations at the Edge
To aid in the operationalization, representatives across all salient functional units and stakeholder groups could be amassed who would constitute a Digital Council. Membership of the Digital Council could be extended to the external quarters as well by solicitation of Client Champions (CCs) to make this exercise more holistic and market oriented, especially where inadequate probes exist at present.
In addition fostering a culture towards Innovation and encouraging ideation and such innovative practices at the edge or periphery will result in reinforcing and harnessing better support towards theDigital Culture to be instilled across the entire organization, resulting in an observant and upbeat tempo across board and the breeding and grooming of Digital Talent from within. HR too would have a pivotal enabling role to play here in the context of appropriate ratio / mix provisioning of seniors rankers and millennials, the new generation who has exposure to disruptive technologies of the digital era. Would follow on to institute digital challenges, digital evaluations, digital incentives and rewards schemes et al. as well which will keep them ticking and upbeat in contrast to address the digital thrusts mooted across.
Innovations at the edge need be vetted and brought to the organizational foray through the structures created from within reviewed, vetted and endorsed by the Digital Council, driven by the champion of Change  The CDO designate.Also budgetsto bring the edge innovations into light or realize them as working solutions in the lines of business, could be allocated as a few percentile(1% to 2%) of anticipated savings as a result of these innovative or automated approaches or even incremental revenues or accrued profits thereby creating a planar within to encourage digital transformations. These edge innovations could even result in an alternative line of business to be set up down the line based on the generic needs they satisfy once productized, which will an alternative revenue stream that corporates could gain in on.
It is very timely that organizations embrace this Digital Wave, which will enable them to stay relevant to their custodian customer base, else who will be seeking switching options across the competitive planar offering such digital enablement facilities, which would provide for greater convenience, relevance, interaction, easy to use mobility options et al.
In addition it would also be a definite eye-opener, and enable the custodian CMOs, Head of lines of business interacting with clients to identifycustomers additional or new requirements on a proactive stance due to the power of data, analytics and the intuitive insights it does provide thus aiding them in their pursuits to gain in on more of the customers mind share and wallet share as a result.
Conclusion
In this Digital Era every single digital interaction  a mouseclick, swipe, transaction, like, comment, browsing of a web link, search et al. produces a unique virtual identifier that conveys customers inner most thinking, preference, sentiments, aspirations et al. and being able to proactively identify, qualify and satisfy this via digital tools will result in suitable product, service positioning and provisioning contrary to the traditional stereotype approaches, which will yield greater returns and provide a guaranteed and sustaining value proposition to any organization.Thus Leaders should be mindful and ensure that their organizations gear themselves for the Digital Era by staying abreast with their of customers and ahead of the market / competitive planar, reminiscing on the wise words of wisdom of former GE Chairman Jack Welch, When the rate of change inside an institution becomes slower than the rate of change outside, the end is in sight.

Drawing attention
Versatile can be the other name for Narmada Bharathi. This 11 year old small town girl has shown prowess in a variety of fields. Be it drawing, Bharatanatyam dancing, creative writing, acting or singing, her passion is unbounded.
Gifted with a flair for drawing, she recently won a belt and certificate for the best leader of the year in a competition organized by the Colombo Childrens Book Society. She also bagged a bronze medal and certificate of achievement for a drawing she submitted to the art competition conducted by the Kumamoto UNESCO Association. Narmada had done a drawing of an eco friendly city under the category of My beautiful city for the competition.
The student of Swarnamali Girls College, Kandy, says that if she was given a choice to excel in only one aesthetic activity she has shown a flair for, she would choose creative writing.
That is because through creative writing I can communicate with people through words without a limited space. Aesthetic activities do not restrict you. They know no prejudice. They helps us become ourselves rather than make us carbon copies of one another, Narmada opined.
She notes that her talent for art emerged out of the blue. It did not come out to the spotlight till she was around six years old. Her mother noticed the little girl dabbling with her coloured pencils and saw her skills for the subject making an appearance on her drawing books. Soon Narmada had a fan base with her grandparents joining in and encouraging her to fine tune her artistry.
Though she uses a variety of media in her art, she says that she prefers to draw mainly using watercolours and acrylics. She does mostly nature and expressional drawings. The first time she scored in art was at the Homerun Pas Varna Mangalya art competition held in 2009. She won third place at the event. Since they were not given a topic for the event Narmada has drawn a picture of herself with her grandparents and two elephants using crayons.
My grandparents are close to my heart. That is why I chose to draw them with me and the elephants. I am sure my grandfather would have been thrilled with my achievements if he had been alive today, Narmada said with a note of sadness.
Another art competition she has excelled in recently was winning a gold medal at the Kshitij International Art Competition which was held towards the end of 2016. It was conducted by India and she had submitted a drawing of a pottery shop for the event.
Queried on what is the most memorable moment in her artistic stint Narmada says that the NSB Patha Patha Hapankam all island art competition she took part in was a milestone for her.
It was my first all island art competition in which I drew at the venue itself rather than submit my work for a competition. It was held in 2015. I won the central province first place and later the all island first place. I did not know that it has clinched the all island first place till the last stages of the event. That drawing was used for the NSB desk calendar as well, Narmada expressed.
She had also taken part in the Literacy Development Project Workshop in Sri Lanka in their 33rd annual training course. The event was organized by the Colombo Childrens Book Society which was founded by Dr Dhammadesha Ambalampitiya. The society has 12 programs each moth every year. The Literacy Development Project Workshop and Leadership Training Workshop are included in their annual calendar. Narmada submitted two works: a poetry book titled A Poem in My Mind and a story book titled Sudu Nendage Sudu Puta at the end of the event which was held at the Department of National Archives. Both books were chosen as worthy material for publication though no one had yet stepped up to help fund the printing procedure.
She has taken part in another program put together by the Colombo Childrens Book Society - an All Island Summer Camp. It was held in April 2016 and marked its 32rd chapter that year. The Education Ministry and Defense Ministry too have been roped in for the event. Each participant had been put in groups with houses named after famous authors. Then they were asked to make fact files about the author. A general knowledge test too had been a part of the program. Narmada had enjoyed the whole experience thoroughly because it had given her the perfect excuse to indulge in her passions. Narmada aims to become a surgeon, a lawyer, or an English lecturer. She encourages other youth to venture forward without hesitation.
You might fail but do not take this as a discouragement. True, there are potholes and pitfalls in life but there are also heartwarming moments and success. Your victory becomes sweeter when you have strived hard to achieve your goal, she said.

Ex-Indian minister raises concerns over differential treatment
Launching of political biography:
Former Indian Minister of State and Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday raised concerns over Indian businesses not receiving the same treatment as Chinese firms.
Indian businesses complain of the extraordinary stringencies your Environmental Impact Assessments have on Indian firms. They say that Chinese companies do not seem to face as many environmental hurdles as Indians do," he said
Tharoor who delivered the keynote address at the launch of the book Ranil Wickremesinghe- A Political Biography, asked Sri Lanka to "ensure a good level playing field for all sides.
As China seeks to rebuild its maritime Silk Route and India reasserts its role in the Indian Ocean, the two countries have found Sri Lanka to be an important and strategic ally to have on their side.
Tharoor argued that India and Sri Lanka had strong economic and cultural ties in addition to sharing certain commonalities with the people of Tamil Nadu. With China, he said, it was always a double edged sword.
There are some concerns that Chinas interest in the Indian Ocean would undermine our own historical links and cultural ties built over centuries, said Tharoor while adding that the Silk Road even its former avatar was cause for concern in the region.
The former diplomat chose to highlight the story of Chinese Admiral Zheng He in the 15th century, who erected a stone tablet translated into Chinese, Persian and Tamil in Galle, with an inscription appealing to Hindu Gods to help him build a peaceful world through trade and commerce.
But in reality Zheng Hes expeditions involved the use of military force, in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and India. He controlled friendly rulers and strategic trade points. Intervened in the dynastic politics of Indonesia and Sri Lanka, abducting and executing local rulers in Kandy and elsewhere. He even seized the relic of the Buddha- a symbol of cultural and political sovereignty," he said.
Tharoor said these were not efforts to establish trade and commerce but also direct intervention in their political affairs under the pretext of ushering in a harmonious world order under the Chinese emperor.
Those who want to revive historical links should also remember historical inequities," he said.
As Chinese investments and power grow in the region in countries like Pakistan, Myanmar and Sri Lanka, Tharoor said that certain countries were looking to India as an alternative security provider, though India was best known for its soft power rather than for its military might in the region. It was vital for India to compensate this weakness with its trade and commerce when competing with China, he said.
One such soft power is the promotion of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), which Tharoor said, was vital for Sri Lanka to be part of.
The Sri Lankan Cabinet this week approved an MoU to be signed among IORA member states to cooperate on and promote Small and Medium enterprises. While it was also reported that Chinas top political advisor Yu Zhengsheng would pay an official visit to Pakistan and Sri Lanka starting Wednesday till Saturday.
What we offer is not a roar of a super power but certainly something better than being one among the several jewels; pearls or otherwise of another countrys geopolitical miscalculations, Tharoor said.

The fascination of cliff diving
Some people dont understand why we go up 27m and jump off, go back up there and do it again, says Gary Hunt (UK), four-time Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series champion, expanding he goes on, its fun, its extreme, and its work  but doesnt feel like work.
Jumping off great heights with no protection other than concentration, skill and physical control in less than three seconds reaching speeds in excess of 85kph and punctuated by awe-inspiring tricks  thats cliff diving and what makes up the main attraction.
If you ask cliff divers to describe their sport in three words, youll always get fun, then some combination of adrenaline, extreme, surreal, magic, and love. A platform as high as an eight-storey building is what they call playground, where they can challenge and push themselves, and where they take off on an adventurous ride down to the water. But what is it that drives them to make the climb up, and the subsequent long drop down, in the first place Even though everybodys story is slightly different, American David Colturis sums it up pretty well: For me cliff diving was originally just a way to prolong diving. Traditional springboard and platform diving for me was my biggest passion and my greatest joy in life from the age of 5 to about 21. And once I finished traditional springboard and platform diving in university I started high diving just to make a small wage and to continue doing what I love. But then one thing led to another. Steve [LoBue] and Kyle [Mitrione] kind of pushed me into the more competitive side of things when we watched a few Red Bull Cliff Diving videos: Hey, maybe we can do this! Next thing I knew, I found this new love and passion in pretty much the same sport, with a couple of obvious differences, and its just opened all these doors for me, all these opportunities. Its crazy to think that this is my fourth year now on the series and every day just gets better than the last. We get to go to the most beautiful locations. Meet some awesome people, experience these new cultures and cuisines. Its crazy to think that cliff diving has brought about all these opportunities, just from jumping off stuff and flipping and twisting on my way down to the water. Its really, really cool.
Its the couple of obvious differences the 26-year-old talks about that make the sport of cliff diving so fascinating for both the athletes as well as the spectators. Once you step out of the pool, the possibilities are endless, describes the sports legendary Orlando Duque, Every time I get a chance to jump off a rock, its probably the best part of my sport to be honest. Its the place that is there, you know nature created it and were using it in the way that we can, were making it work to do what we do, were changing the angle of the take-off, were trying to change positions in the air, trying to avoid rocks and that makes it that much more interesting. We are taking our technique, which we learned for so many years, and adapting it to that one specific situation. And then the spot next to it might be completely different, so we have to change again. A willingness to break barriers Yes, says Gary Hunt, as a cliff diver you need to be a rule-breaker: In the sport of competitive diving its very regulated, and youre told what you have to do; but most of the cliff divers kind of find their own way and do what they want.
Cliff diving is unique with or without a platform and  at the level the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series has built up to in the past years  is reserved for a select group of smart and brave people, where everyone has his or her very own thrill factor. It might be the speed one gets when falling to the water  as for Orlando Duque, or being in full control of oneself  as for Gary Hunt, or simply the flight as soon as youre done with your tricks and you guide your body into the water as vertically as possible  as what American Andy Jones describes as his favourite moment. For the first ever winner of the Womens World Series, Texan Rachelle Simpson, the adrenaline rush is very empowering: I am afraid every time before a dive and when I overcome that Im proud of myself and amazed; when I watch my videos Im like wow I can convince myself to do that and other girls, too.
Common phrases like: a change from the stress and doubts you have in your mind, which instantly dissolve into nothingness as soon as you take off, this battle inside, trying to stay confident, thinking of simple things to help you do this crazy act, safely and successfully or Im always nervous at the beginning, but as soon as I lift off the platform for the most part I feel really confident, it feels natural express the sports best parts. Its all about passion, challenge, and intense experiences  and gives us, the regular people, an idea of the magical moments cliff divers go through in every single dive. And although this dont sound like a job, it can even be that  a very cool job, says Andy Jones: I never expected cliff diving to take me where I am today. Its really cool that I get to do this, I really enjoy it and its pretty badass, that thats what I get to do for my income.
Besides working hard in the gym, in the pool, eating right, taking good care of the body, and always facing the risk of injury, it sounds clich, but its just so very true  cliff diving is amazing, it makes you appreciate life and feel alive!

Finance sector likely to experience dip in margins - First Capital Research
With rising interest rates and bulk of the lending attached to leases, the finance sector is likely to experience a dip in margins according to First Capital Research.
Credit growth is expected to remain moderate around 16 to 18% despite deceleration from 2016. Despite rise interest rates and slower economic conditions FC Research expects NPL provisions of finance companies to continue to stay on the back significant price appreciations in the second hand vehicle market. Higher vehicle prices are likely to deter related borrowers from default while even if defaulted higher vehicles prices ensure finance companies of eliminating losses and recovering bad debts. FC Reserch expects the local finance sector to face moderately tough conditions to operate with thinning margins and new LTV regulations leading to slower and previous but moderate credit growth.
Finance sector comprises of licensed finance companies (LFCs) and specialised leasing companies (SLCs) represent 6% of assets of the Sri Lankas financial system and consists of 46 LFCs and 7 SLCs with a network of 1,259 branches. Despite slow economic conditions rise in (Non Performing Loans) NPLs are likely to be slow amidst price appreciation in vehicle prices as bulk of the lending is attached to vehicles. We believe the larger finance companies have an advantage with lower cost of funding and large conversion levels from leases to loans which improves re-pricing abilities at times of rising interest rates. Finance companies with better rating and larger asset base tend to have a lower cost of funding while some finance companies have already converted significant portions from loans to leases enabling them to re-price part of the assets in line with interest rates.

Foreign judiciary judgement could not be implemented in SL: Dissanayake
No judgement given by a foreign judiciary can be implemented in Sri Lanka. So far, three such judgements had been given by Foreign judiciaries, but none of them were implemented here in Sri Lanka, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake said. Addressing a press conference held at his Ministry Office at Sethsiripaya, Battaramulla yesterday he said, one such judgement was given to him while he was imprisoned for two years. "When I was put under a two year rigorous imprisonment, I complained to the International Court. Thirteen foreign judges freed me from the case and asked the Sri Lankan Government to pay me compensation. They asked for a change in the laws in Sri Lanka which imprisoned me. But nothing happened," he said.
According to Minister Dissanayake,
President Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe have already decided not to entertain foreign judges. There may be different opinions and ideas among political parties and ministers in the Government, but the final decision had been made in connection with the issue.
Minister Dissanayake said, "The current Constitution of Sri Lanka does not permit foreign judges or a foreign judiciary, and the current Constitution would not be changed to allow them. Since Sri Lankan judges work in foreign countries, the local judiciary is strong to tackle the issue, according to the President. There is nothing mentioned about a referendum in President Sirisena's printed Election Manifesto. So we will not have one."
