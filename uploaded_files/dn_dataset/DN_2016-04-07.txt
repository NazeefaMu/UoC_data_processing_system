Rukmini Kodagoda Trophy Junior Golf Championship from April 18
Sri Lanka Junior Match Play Golf Championship for the Rukmini Kodagoda Trophy is once again set to be held at the Royal Colombo Golf Club from April 18 to 21. Inaugurated in 2014, this annual tournament will be sponsored by Perera and Sons Bakers Ltd, for the third consecutive year.
The prestigious tournaments scheduled for the year and popular given the match play format which is one of a kind, will award the winner of the overall championship to carry away the Rukmini Kodagoda Challenge trophy while the qualifying medal round of the championship would be a designated round for national junior ranking for the year 2016,which stands as a recent introduction.
The Sri Lanka Gold Union is focused in developing the young pool of golfers below 14 years, hence sub segmenting the pool between Bronze and Copper division. The tournament will be played over four days and will comprise of four age groups as follows; 15-17 years (Overall/Gold Division), 12-14 years (Silver Division), 10 -11years (Bronze Division) and 9 years and under (Copper Division). The manner of play would be based on a qualifying stroke play round whereby the best eight qualify to play, match play knock out. There would be many prizes on offer such as best gross score on qualifying round and plate winner for non-qualifiers on day two best gross score.
The junior match play championship is a fitting tribute to Rukmini Kodagoda, who won the Sri Lanka Amateur Championship in 1979 and several other club tournaments. Ruki as she was popularly known established herself as one of Sri Lanka's talented sports women having won national titles and represented Sri Lanka in both tennis and golf. She also held the prestigious position of Chairman Sri Lanka Ladies Golf Union in 1990 and 1991 and Captain of the Ladies Section of the Royal Colombo Golf Club.

Shifting sands of national rugby
The club 2016 season gave Kandy SC their best account yet again, and much credit to the management and coaching staff headed by newly stepped up Sean Wijeysinghe, Nalaka Weerakody and company. Lasantha Wijesuriya is rugby chairman Kandy SC and needs to clear two more spaces in the trophy cabinet to welcome the league and knockout silverware.
Grand celebrations marked the clubs return to winning ways and their special brand of rugby - good teams are built on the quality of players and hardwork. Simple principles that drill the mind more than the body ...instilling confidence belief and work rate in the middle.
Playing styles and strategy may vary ...but the fundamental ability to finish better ...has given them a cutting edge skill down to the wire. Good teams have solid reserves for the last 15mins ...that inspiration could be impact players off the bench or sheer guts from the rapidly tiring warrior in the middle.
Kandy's survival against CR and Havelocks is a good example of this skill factor. The modern game is all about the depth and strength of your 23 squad for the match...not just your best 15 on paper. The RWC 2015 in England easily the best example of depth and remarkable All Black skills that made them favourites from the start.
The pressure to get quality players becomes the fundamental priority for all teams with serious ambition to succeed. The gene pool for such players a hot button topic of much debate at club and a lot more animated at school level.
Talented young hopefuls get a fab break to transfer from district school to one of the major rugby stables ...a sort of skill draft to beef up that team.
The current Sri Lanka squad bubbling with such natural ability - Sandun Herath, Shenal Dias, Dhanushka Ranjan ...plus a host of others equally hungry and talented.
The need is to have a regulated draft process with adequate compensation for the school of origin ...most practical and a sensible incentive that will drive the quality to the next level.
The Singer schools season is already causing waves islandwide ....still running to form and the big established seats of learning, holding on to their pre season hype. Trinity and Royal College discovering the power of Wesley rugby. The result shows wins for both schools ...but just. Wesley have their lack of finishing, lack of running straight in the threes and missed kicks to mark as blame. 7/5 v Trinity was too close to call.
Let's hope more belief and less hesitation that cost them the Royal match at Longdon Place. I am hoping they get those basics right this week and have a good celebration for April season.
S Thomas' seemed to have spent time on their departments and have certainly given a warning to all teams ahead of them. Coach Lagga and his team enjoying the initial stamp of authority ...controlling the game from the whistle. Expect some bone jarring tackles and max impact, this Saturday when the traditional rivals line up for their annual shield ...Royal grit v Thora belief, and it's the pack play that will decide the result.
If unable to watch it live...you are definitely missing out. Catch the live stream and commentary on the papare.com as they netcast the intensity around the world, delighting old boys on many levels.
National rugby turns to Asian division 1 and matches against Malaysia, Korea, Kazak and Philippines to target a slot with the big Asian unions. The team very likely to be handed to Johann Taylor once the selectors name the tour squad.
The national Women 7s are in Hongkong for the World Series invitation ...host HK, Thailand, and Argentina make up our group. ARFU are keen to grade us and our performance level at the highest mark in Asia. Linda Itunu has a tough task to mentally prep the side for their step up...it's a massive ask and blessings to the SRi islanders for courage and pride.
It's a grand prospect to imagine our future for island rugby and the unions push to broadbase the rapid development of this global game.
I am still hoping that the union will harness the enormous bank of local player and coaching experience ...to pull in the numbers and grade each player forward. We need to certify as many coaches from first class and national rugby to handle the specialist tasks to mentally and physically prepare them.
Elite athletes are required for the creation of a high performance facility ...which gives our home union a step up on the Asian platform. The full requirement is for gladiators ...players with bigger hearts than average. A mind for intense work and an appetite never to give up despite the pressure.
Success is a lethal combination of mind over matter and a relentless attitude that redefines all conventional systems. Positive thinking and cold steel belief that shatters normality is the ask...I believe it's all ahead and just a matter of time before we discover our warriors with that special kryptonite.
Bula bula Sri rugby!

## Title: Kandy SC's 'Mr Rugby'

Kandy SC's 'Mr Rugby'
Malik Samarawickrama who richly deserves to be tagged as 'Mr. Rugby' has contributed immensely to give Kandy Sports Club a place at the top in local rugby football. His involvement with the club to make them what they are today is worth its weight in gold.
When one talks about sports in the city of Kandy it is rugby that comes to mind. Indeed, it isn't coincidence that Kandy's rise in rugby is synchronized with Samarawickrama's loyalty to the game, club and rugby supporters in the hill capital. However, the ever modest garment industry tycoon sees it differently. He insists that one may pour in all the funds and material, but if one does not have the men and the spirit to convert these 'goodies' into success, the club will not make any headway.
Fortunately for Kandy SC, its officials, sponsors and well-wishers have delivered with spirit, all the necessary facilities at all times providing the players the best and they have repaid by pocketing all trophies and titles on offer. As long as Samarawickrama is around, sponsorship and support will flow like the Mahaweli. The team plays its part by performing at peak and putting to second best all other clubs.
Today in Kandy rugby is the only sport which is on the correct path at club level. The rugby ground is not a place for the frail or faint-hearted sportsman. Rugby players of Kandy have been acknowledged as some of the most skillfull to play the game, lighting up Sri Lanka rugby for many years. This is the third time they have won the double by being unbeaten. The first was under Lasantha Wijesuriya, then under Sean Wijesinghe and this time under Fazil Marija.
Last Friday, Kandy ruggerites were given a heroes welcomes when they were greeted by the committee members and fans at a get-together. Every player was presented with a medal and Samarawickrama awarded personal contributions to each player and everyone who was involved with the team. Such generosity should not pass without being acknowledged.
Kandy SC is a club with a long and proud history. It is important to recognize the man who has made a significant contribution to the game and made Kandy maintain its dominance it has held since 1992. It has become the brightest era in Kandy purely due to the foundation Malik has laid at the Nittawela club.
It took 42 years for this club to win a major trophy and become an invincible force in the rugby field thereby destroying the dominance of Colombo based clubs. That was after Malik's arrival. . As a result the Hill Capital changed the destiny of local inter-club rugby, including the rugby playing schools in Kandy who have raised their standards and become a driving force in the Schools' Association.
Samarawickrama is a strict disciplinarian. He helped the side to win the league 19 times since 1994 and the Clifford Cup 20 times. All the good work by Kandy SC 1992 has been due to Malik's initiatives, know-how, and solid backing. He has made successful contracts with players, promoted careers and given employment; and arranged sponsors. So successful was he, that players from Colombo showed keen interest in turning out for Kandy SC.
Malik was the founder of the Singer/Sri Lankan Airlines International Sevens. He supported and helped the organizers to conduct this tournament for 10 years from 1999 to 2008 gaining IRB status in 2004. This international sevens tournament, which was introduced to celebrate 125 years of Kandy Sports Club in 1999, was one of the most successful international tournaments to be organized in Sri Lanka. Again in 2004 the club conducted the Rugby World Cup Qualifier for the Asian Region. On successfully conducting this event, the IRB offered the event the first "Asian Region Rugby Seven's Satellite Series" in 2005 and even provided IRB funds to conduct this tournament. Unfortunately this tournament was 'high-jacked' by the Rugby Union and taken to Colombo. Malik is used to saying that whilst it is easy to reach the top, it is more difficult to stay on top! Kandy SC has stayed at the top for a decade.
When the history of rugby is recorded at Nittawela and the controlling body, the name of Malik Samarawickrama will stand out as one of the greatest administrators and friend of this sport and whom we all love.

Explore 'explosives' mindfully
The discovery of a suicide kit and explosives in Chavakachcheri in the Jaffna district has led to significant concerns about the status of the country's security and its handling by both the government and the Opposition has raised more questions than answers.
The police had recovered a suicide jacket, four claymore mines, three parcels containing around 12kg of explosives, two packets of 9 mm ammunition and two battery packs which were wrapped in a Sinhala newspaper published on January 29, 2008.
These items were found in a house in Vallakulam, Chavakachcheri in the Jaffna district last week. The discovery was fortuitous in that it followed Police intervention in a domestic dispute that led to a routine search of a house there.
The critical question that arises is whether these explosives were a remnant of the Eelam war or whether they have been brought to Chavakachcheri subsequently. If it is the latter, it raises a whole gamut of questions with a central theme: are the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) regrouping
Petty political advantage
It is incumbent upon the government to answer these questions honestly and provide as much information as possible to the public - within the constraints of discussing a sensitive national security issue. By the same token, it is the duty of the Opposition to act responsibly while raising pertinent questions, instead of attempting to gain a petty political advantage that would in the long run be harmful to the country's interests. Unfortunately, both the government and the opposition have been found wanting in this regard.
A judicial inquiry in to the matter is underway. This week, Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Attygala ordered the Terrorist Investigations Division (TID) to obtain a report from the Government Analyst regarding the explosives. Further magisterial inquiry has been fixed for April 20.
The government's official response has come mostly in the form of views expressed by Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi. Addressing a press conference, Secretary Hettiarachchi said there is a "huge gap" between national security and the discovery of these explosives. He appeared to discount the possibility of an emerging threat of terrorism suggesting that this could be a 'left over' from the war era and adding that discoveries of such explosives have been reported frequently in recent years, since the conclusion of the Eelam war.
Threat to national security
Hettiarachchi's pronouncements- especially when the matter is still under investigation- appear premature at best and that has had the opposition up in arms. While what the Defence Secretary has stated is indeed correct, he conveys the impression that matter has already been determined. This has allowed the opposition- mostly, the self-proclaimed 'Joint Opposition'- to seize the issue to try and embarrass the government.
Leading the charge, as usual, has been Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP) leader Wimal Weerawansa who appears to have done exactly the opposite of what the Defence Secretary did: he appears to have come to the conclusion that the explosives are indeed a recent phenomenon and therefore, it surely follows that the LTTE is up and running once again!
Not content with that, Weerawansa has called for Defence Secretary Hettiarachchi's resignation. Sri Lanka would have been in danger if Hettiarachchi had been in office during the war years because he has interpreted this incident as not being a threat to the national security, Weerawansa argues. Launching a tirade against a government official who cannot officially respond is not the best of strategies but then, Weerawansa hardly has a reputation for taking the moral high ground on such issues.
Also fishing in troubled waters was former Minister G.L. Peiris. Now out of office and out of Parliament, it appears as if Peiris is keen to seize any issue to gain some publicity for himself. Peiris said the Government was attempting to hide the truth and had provided false information regarding the discovery. There was information that the explosives were prepared to being sent to Wellawatte, Peiris claimed.
If Weerawansa had been critical and playing to the gallery to secure a political advantage, Peiris' comments are more damning and unbecoming of someone who was a Professor of Law, a Vice-Chancellor and a Minister of Justice. While it is well known in political circles that Peiris has long eschewed playing the gentleman in politics, his comments still came as a surprise because it amounted to scaremongering at a time the country has embarked on the difficult road to reconciliation.
Unfortunately, the government's response to Peiris was also amateurish. Cabinet spokesman and Minister Gayantha Karunatilaka declared at a press briefing that Peiris must be questioned over the utterances he had made as he "apparently had vital information on this detection in advance". And sure enough, a few days later Peiris was questioned for two hours by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) over his remarks.
If indeed, Peiris needed to be interrogated on account of the comments he had made, that could have been handled professionally by the Police. With Minister Karunatilaka first declaring that he should be questioned and the Police then doing just that, it conveys the impression that this is all a political exercise, while the main issue- whether there is a real and present danger to national security- is being ignored.
In fact, Peiris would have enjoyed the whole exercise of being summoned to the CID to record his statement. It casts him in the role of victim and enables him to say, 'see, instead of investigating the explosives, they are harassing me'. And of course, for any politician out of power, any publicity is good publicity.
On the contrary, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's comments on the issue came as a welcome surprise. Rajapaksa frequently claims credit for ending the Eelam war and would have been expected to joint the chorus from the Joint Opposition ringing alarm bells in the South of the country claiming that the LTTE has raised its head again.
Discovery of explosives
Instead, Rajapaksa has been rather restrained in his comments. The former President has said that the discovery of explosives should not be regarded as something trivial and that suitable action should be taken to dispel the suspicion and the fear that is now emerging as a result.
It is essential that the public be kept informed of the actual security situation, Rajapaksa has suggested. It is to Rajapaksa's credit that he has stopped short of blaming the government or calling for resignations and perhaps the years he spent directing the war effort has led to this mature response.
Meanwhile, officially the matter is still under investigation. Sri Lankans are none the wiser as to whether the explosives discovered were of recent origin or dating back to the war years. The general public, once bitten twice shy after suffering thirty years of war where the suicide bomber was a frequent occurrence, will be understandably perturbed.
It would be in the government's own interests in the long term to expedite investigations and reveal the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. It would pay to take the public in to their confidence rather than trying to gloss over the issue or dismiss it lightly. Similarly, the Opposition too must act responsibly, instead of recklessly, because war is too serious a matter to be left to politicians alone. We have seen little of this from both sides ever since that explosive detection in Chavakachcheri.

Cricket Australia release Sri Lanka tour itinerary

Australia's tour of Sri Lanka has been announced today (April 6) with the three-Test series set to begin on July 26 in Kandy. During their two-month tour starting on July 11, Australia will play five One-Day Internationals (ODIs) and two T20Is in addition to the Test series.
Australia returned to the top of the Test tree after a convincing series victory in New Zealand in February and have yet to lose a Test under new captain Steve Smith. They will enter the series as strong favourites with Sri Lanka enduring a difficult transition since the retirements of legendary batsmen Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene. However, conditions in the sub-continent always pose a serious challenge to Australia although they boast a formidable record in Sri Lanka having lost only one Test there from 13 matches. Sri Lanka's only Test series victory against Australia was a 1-0 series victory in 1999 that was marred by rain.
Australia last played Tests in Sri Lanka five years ago where they won a three-match affair 1-0 in former skipper Michael Clarke's first series as captain. Nathan Lyon, Peter Siddle and Usman Khawaja played in that series but Australia boast few other players with experience in Sri Lanka.

CIS beats Presbyterians in a thriller
Colombo International School (CIS) lasses dished out a courageous performance to tame Presbyterian Girls School (PGS), Dehiwala in their own den (39-37) and walked away with the 'B' division under-17 cagers title when the two teams battled it out in a thrilling final yesterday. CIS posted a narrow one point lead at half time (16-15).
Home team dominated the first quarter and scored 12 points while restricting visitors to five points. But in the following quarter visitors made a wise decision to send two players for a full court man-to-man defence, where two key Presbyterian attackers were blocked. CIS bounced back strongly in attack as well and scored 11 points to close the gap while only conceding three points to opponents in the second quarter.
After the breather both teams tried hard to seize the lead and it has been a ding-dong battle for a while.
Leia Hamza of CIS who was adjudged the Most Valuable Player of the Tournament driving in followed by a Presbyterian defender.
After scores were tied at 19 all, three back to back baskets from homesters saw turning the tide for Presbyterians. But CIS did not allow them to make merry and came up with a good counter attack. With Leia Hamza sinking a three pointer, once again CIS leveled the scores at 25 all. This score stood at the end of penultimate quarter.
Even in the final quarter both teams fought hard and Presbyterians maintained their lead in the beginning.
During the latter stage CIS captain Sinali Ilangage scored two back to back baskets to level the scores at 36 all. After Presbyterians scored a single point just before the final whistle, Sinali scored a superb three pointer to steal the victory (39-36).
Leia Hamza of CIS who scored 19 points in the final was adjudged the Most Valuable Player of the Tournament while her team mate captain Sinali Ilangage who scored nine points was awarded the Best Defensive Player trophy. Ishadi Wathsala of Presbyterian GS was picked as the Best Offensive Player.
Sirimovo Bandaranaike MV bagged the third place beating St. Bridget's Convent 44-36 in the consolation final on Tuesday at the same venue.

Pay increase for Australian female cricketers

Cricket Australia (CA) on Wednesday (April 5) announced significant pay rise for the leading women cricketers in the country, many of who were part of the team that finished as runners-up in the recently concluded 2016 ICC Women's World Twenty20 in India.
The female cricketers will now be able to earn in excess of $100,000 a year, making them the best paid of any women's team sport in Australia, after CA announced the decision to almost double its commitment to Australia's elite female cricketers from $2.36 million to $4.23 million.
The maximum retainers for the team is set to rise from $49,000 to $65,000, and when combined with increased maximum retainers for the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL) of $15,000, the base rate for Australia's best female players will amount to $80,000. The match payments and tour fees will ensure earnings in excess of six figures.
Minimum retainers have more than doubled, from $19,000 to $40,000, for the Southern Stars and $3,000 to $7,000 for those featuring in WBBL. And with an increase in the Women's National Cricket League (WNCL) payments - from $7000 to $11,000 - Australia's best domestic female cricketers will be earning $26,000 a season.
In addition to increased pay packages, CA, in consultation with the Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA) is also providing elite female players with improved travel and accommodation benefits, an updated pregnancy policy, restrictions on weekday hours of domestic team training to support players who are either working or studying and also, reduced commercial restrictions for WNCL and WBBL players.
Above all, the ACA has also committed $500,000, over a period of two years, to cover private health insurance costs for the female stars.
James Sutherland, CEO of CA, said the female cricketers were some of the most successful sportswomen in the country and deserved to be rewarded accordingly. "Cricket is a sport for all Australians and Cricket Australia will continue to invest heavily in the women's game in the coming years," Sutherland said.
"We are determined to make cricket the sport of choice for women in Australia. We have worked constructively with the Australian Cricketers' Association to reach this point and will continue to do so in our ongoing efforts to improve wages and workplace conditions for all elite female cricketers."
CA's National Women's Selection Panel also announced its list of contracted players for the 2016-17 season, which includes World T20 stars like Meg Lanning, Ellyse Perry, Alyssa Healy and Alex Blackwell amongst others. - TOI

A Rightful fight for education
As an administrative professional working for SAITM and even before joining SAITM, I have been observing the SAITM saga going on for the last five to six years. I was trying my best to find some logic behind the varying arguments against SAITM but utterly failed. The following points need consideration.
Is SAITM enrolling lower grade students for the medical degree
SAITM enrolls only 75 students per batch out of approximately 500 applicants. Therefore even though the cut off mark for university entrance is 3Ss, those who get selected are with much better results. Even if it is with 3Ss, they are qualified for university entrance and they have the right to study what they like. It is just government universities cannot facilitate it due to resource limitations. Otherwise they are eligible to do medicine even in government universities.
Even though SAITM hardly recruit students with minimum qualifications, many of them get their degrees from the so called SLMC approved foreign universities and return to the country for practice.
SAITM has also enrolled many London A/L qualified students with 3A's and they have no other choice as they cannot enter government universities.
Government sector teaching hospitals
Medicine is a profession and there is very a little relationship between A/L and medicine. So the same way, there is a very little relationship between how you perform at A/L and as a medical doctor.
Do SAITM students lack clinical exposure
It is not easy to compare the government sector teaching hospitals and a private sector teaching hospital. In the government sector, there are patients in the bed, side of the bed and even on chairs. This is not the same in the private sector and there are standards when a private teaching hospital allows students to examine patients. As this is the same even in the developed world, there are different teaching techniques used in the private sector to provide necessary training to students.
But when SAITM wanted to use few government hospitals that are not used by government universities as their teaching hospitals, the pressure groups went against this. This shows their hypocritical nature. From one end, they argue on the quality of clinical exposure, from the other end they block SAITM students having access to government hospitals for clinical exposure.
Is it ethical to limit government hospitals to government medical students
Whether they are private medical students or government medical students, they are citizens of Sri Lanka. Government hospitals are not maintained by government medical faculties but by the tax payers' money. So whether they are government or private, they should have equal access to government hospitals.
As the parents of private medical students pay more taxes, they should have better access to government hospitals.
If government medical students say private medical students should not come to government hospitals, how about government qualified medical officers not coming to private hospitals but stick to government hospitals
Pressure groups are on silly arguments such as "If a tuition class does not have a lab, should the government provide a lab" If the policy is, free education to all, government should provide the free labs and free education to all. But if the government does not have funds to provide both labs and education free, if there is a set of students who can afford private education but not labs, what is the problem in government providing labs for them It is win win for both parties.
Private teaching hospital
In fact SAITM needs a government hospital for subjects that cannot be taught only in the private sector such as Community Medicine and Judiciary Medicine. If not they have their own private teaching hospital which is the largest among the private hospitals in the country. Community medicine is a subject that needs exposure to a cross section of the society, so that cannot be learnt only by studding patients at a private hospital. Judiciary medicine is about postmortems etc. that is not legal to be practised in a private hospital environment.
Will nationalising SAITM be a solution to free education
Shortage of free education is due to poverty. The solution to poverty is, not to nationalise private institutions. This was proven over and over again during communism. A simple e.g.: The worst issue in the world is not medical education but shortage of food. If nationalisation is the solution, the easy solution to food shortage should be nationalising all the food manufacturing organisations and giving it free!
Is free education a myth
There is nothing call free education. It is an illusion. Someone is paying for any service we consume. Just because we do not pay for it that does not mean it falls from the sky. Private medical students pay for themselves and we all pay for government medical students' education. That means private medical students in fact pay for government medical students' education as well. So why cannot private medical students study what they want by paying their own money Real free education is freedom for education. That is what a group of people is trying to block for another group of people.
How come only medical education cannot be offered private
Medicine is another profession, just like engineering, architecture, finance, admin etc. Currently education opportunities for all the other professions are offered in the private sector and they are in fact equally competitive or sometimes better than what is offered in the government sector.
Another argument in this regard is, medical professionals deal with human lives, so their education needs to be perfect but others' not! What about engineers then Aren't they dealing with human lives If an aeronautical engineer makes a small mistake, it could be hundreds of people dying at once. What about civil engineers If they make a mistake it could be thousands of people dying at once. Even if a bus driver makes a mistake, it could be many people dying and they all deal with human lives. If a doctor does a mistake, luckily it won't be hundreds or thousands dying at once, it is mostly just one or two people and he/ she will lose his/ her licence. So the answer is not to keep education to government sector but to provide right education to what ever the profession.
Quality of healthcare
Are these pressure groups really fighting to give a better care to public
We can understand this when we go to a government hospital. Not all but the majority is not even in the hospitals, but at their private practices. Moment they get out of government universities, their prime objective is not to serve public at government hospitals, but to earn money in the private sector. Even the little time they are in hospitals, they do not treat patients humanly. Rarely a doctor would have some sympathy towards patients' queries. If a patient tries to talk to a doctor regarding his/ her illness, they would jump at him/ her, as if, it is the biggest crime he/ she has done.
If they are so worried about the quality of healthcare offered to public, there are bigger issues they should fight on, such as: mushrooming low quality nursing homes, labs and clinics, drug companies selling low quality drugs at very high prices, one-minute appointments of consultation at exorbitant rates and doctors unethical in their practice such as prescribing brands. How come they do not ask to nationalise private hospitals and give free healthcare to public Healthcare is a more primary need to people than medical education. So it is more important to give free healthcare than free medical education.
Isn't it funny that we still do not have a single private medical school but import medical education from countries such as Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Belarus and Ukraine
Sri Lanka has an excellent track record of healthcare for a longer period thanks to government and private healthcare institutions. But we keep importing medical education from countries that are not even closer to us where healthcare standards are concerned. Isn't it a shame for the whole country
Sri Lanka Medical Council could find many private medical schools in those countries to accredit but it is a pity that there is not a single yet in Sri Lanka. If there is a private university in Sri Lanka, our students will not look for foreign universities and SLMC will have better access to monitor quality of their education.
Foreign medical education
The much needed foreign currency drain is due to foreign medical education. Due to the petty mindedness of pressure groups, a large number of students go to other countries for a long period of medical education. It affects foreign currency reserves used for their education abroad. If we have started private medical education sometime back, by now we will be attracting a huge number of medical students from abroad. Countries like USA, Australia, Russia and even India make big money out of selling education to the whole world.
Is government qualification that great
If government qualification is that great, how could they commit mistakes such as amputating the wrong limb Why do patients die owing to negligence of the medical practitioners
This is a more visible benefit to the public of Sri Lanka than the benefit of foreign currency saving.

Preamble to sustainable development
The adoption by the United Nations in 1986 of the Declaration on the Right to Development ("the Declaration") was the culmination of a long process of international campaigning for human rights. From the beginning, the idea of human rights as an international concern was perceived as an integrated whole consisting of all civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.
The idea of integrated human rights as an international concern was first declared in the Charter of the United Nations in 1945 and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and later in subsequent international instruments. Accordingly unity of all rights - civil and political rights as well as economic, social and cultural rights was recognized. In 1986 UN General Assembly adopted Declaration on the Right to Development which marks the culmination of a long process of international campaigning for right to development which was endorsed by the UN Vienna Declaration in 1993 and the subsequent international instruments.
Human rights set universal standards of achievement and norms of behaviour for all states, civil societies, and the international community and impose inviolable obligations on all of them to make those rights achievable. Recognizing the right to development as a human right raises the status of that right to one with universal applicability and inviolability, it also specifies a norm of action for the people, the institution or the state and international community on which the claim for that right is made.
Content of the right to development
Firstly the right to development refers to a process of development which leads to the realization of each human right and of all of them together and which has to be carried out in a manner known as rights-based, in accordance with the international human rights standards, as a participatory, non-discriminatory, accountable and transparent process with equity in decision-making and sharing of fruits of the process. Equity-which is essential to any notion of human rights derived from the idea of equality of all human beings in rights, dignity and opportunity, and is associated with fairness or the principles of a just society-is basic to that process. Secondly, the objectives of development should be expressed in terms of claims or entitlements of right-holders, which duty-bearers must protect and promote. The identification of the corresponding obligation at the national and the international level is essential to a rights-based approach.
As the Declaration on the Right to Development itself points out, the primary responsibility for implementing the right to development belongs to states. The beneficiaries are individuals. The international community has the duty to corporate to enable the states to fulfill their obligations. Thirdly, to make the right to development a valid, concrete right, the procedures for carrying out the obligations have to be worked out so that the rights can be realized through appropriate social arrangement.
The following sections elaborate on these implications. The content of the right to development can be analyzed on the basis of the text of the Declaration on the Right to Development. Article 1, paragraph 1 of the Declaration states, "The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development, in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized".
This Article spells out three principles: (a) there is an inalienable human right that is called the right to development; (b) there is a particular process of economic, social, cultural and political development, in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized; and (c) the right to development is a human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to and enjoy that particular process of development.
The first principle affirms the right to development as an inalienable human right and, as such, the right cannot be taken or bargained away. The second principle defines a process of development in terms of the realization of "human rights," which are enumerated in the Universal Declaration and other human rights instruments adopted by United Nations and regional bodies. The third principle defines the right to that process of development in terms of claims or entitlements or rights holders, which duty bearers must protect and promote. Development is defined in the preamble of the Declaration of the Right to Development as a comprehensive economic, social, cultural and political process, which aims at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals, on the basis of their active, free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting there from".
The process of development that is recognized as a human right is the one, in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized", consequent to the constant improvement of well being that is the objective of development. Article 8 states more specifically that in taking steps to realize the right to development, states shall ensure "equality of opportunity for all in their access to basic resources, education, health services, food, housing employment and the fair distribution of income", and take effective measures to ensure "that women have an active role in the development process", as well as carrying out "appropriate economic and social reforms with a view to eradicating all social injustices".
The right to development as the right to a process of development
Several articles in the Declaration elaborate the point that the right claimed as a human right is the right to a particular process of development. A closer analysis of these articles reveals a number of important features of that process. A country, it may be noted, can develop by many different processes. There may be a sharp increase in gross domestic product (GDP) with the "richer groups", which have greater access to financial and human capital, becoming increasingly prosperous, and the "poorer sections" lagging behind, if not remaining deprived.
Dr. Amartya Sen on human development
The nature of this process of development is centred around the concept of equity and justice, with the majority of the population, who are currently poor and deprived, having their living standards raised and capacity to improve their position strengthened, leading to the improvement of the well-being of the entire population. On the face of it, this approach is substantially different from the usual approach to economic development, preoccupied with the growth of output of material products and marketable services.
This development process has to be participatory. The new paradigm of development thinking was also introduced in the human development approach, as built up by the Human Development Reports of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and as articulated by Dr. Amartya Sen in his writings on development.
Duties and obligations
For the realization of any right the assignment of duties must be carried out so as to establish accountability. Article 2, paragraph 2 of the Declaration stipulates that all human beings, individually and collectively have a responsibility for securing the right to development, "as well as their duties to the community" with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. States, according to Article 3 have "the primary responsibility for the creation of national and international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development. At the national level, in Article 2, paragraph 3 it is pointed out that "States have the right and the duty to formulate appropriate national development policies". According to Article 8, "States should undertake, at the national level, all necessary measures for the realization of the right to development", and "should encourage popular participation in all spheres". In addition, in Article 6, states are required to take steps "to eliminate obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights as well as economic, social and cultural rights", because the implementation, promotion and protection of those rights would be essential for realizing the right to development.
Environmental justice
It must be stressed that the right to development whatever it may mean-is not unlimited. It cannot be said that individuals of states - as contended in the Declaration - have the right to develop in any manner they wish. The right to development - if such a right indeed exists under international law and many believe that it does not - must take place with due regard to other accepted rights and within the framework of international law itself, of which environmental protection is an important component.
In other words, the debate on environmental protection must be reconciled with the debate on the right to development and, in the opinion of the author; the concept of sustainable development provides the answer. The Rio Declaration of 1992 also refers to the right to sustainable development which seeks to bridge the gap between environmental protection and economic development. In other words, the Rio Declaration makes it clear that the right to development is not unlimited and must be pursued within the framework of sustainable development.
This is an important development as it seeks to remedy the lacuna in the UN Declaration on Right to Development wherein no reference was made to environmental protection.
