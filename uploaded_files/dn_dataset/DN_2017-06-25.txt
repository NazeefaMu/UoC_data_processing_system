Firefighters are now at the scene tackling the blaze.
Unconfirmed reports suggest the tanker had overturned because of speeding, and later caught fire.
Eyewitnesses say some people were smoking at the scene of the accident, which could have started the fire, Pakistan's Geo TV reports.
Identities of a number of victims may only be established by DNA sampling, as the bodies badly burned in the incident, reports say.
