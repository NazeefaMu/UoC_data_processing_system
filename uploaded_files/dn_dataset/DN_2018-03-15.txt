Consensus with social media operators vital
Computer Society of Sri Lanka President (CCSL) Yasas Vishuddhi Abeywickrama emphasised that the Sri Lankan government needs to come to an agreement with social media platform operators such as Facebook, Watsapp and Viber in order to control fake news, hate speech, spreading through these sites in a bid to stop communal hatred and violence.
It s high time to put in place necessary systems or tools to filter fake news or hateful contents, being shared on social media platforms as automatic and human intervened removal of fake contents are currently limited or inadequate.
However, Abeywickrama emphasised that the government should not fully control content being shared or circulated on these platforms or breach the peoples right to freedom of speech or expression in the name of national security while prolonging the ban since social media platforms have given a voice to the general public to express their ideas and opinions on many timely subjects and issues in the country.
Commenting on the government decision to prolong the ban imposed on social media sites, Abeywickrama stated that prolonging of the ban has posed a greater damage to the nations reputation for freedom and openness as well as the tourism, the IT sector related businesses.
Meanwhile President Maithripala Sirisena has also urged that it is essential to introduce a new framework to prevent circulating fake and hateful contents on social media platforms.
President Sirisena has also revealed that the daily income of Sri Lanka Telecom and Telecommunication and Regulatory Commission has increased by over Rs 200 million after the government imposed a ban on Facebook, WhatsApp , Viber to control fake news and hate speech spreading through these sites.

Bacteria battling environment harm during oil spills discovered
K. P. Dulan Tharaka, a student of the Colombo University Botany Department has discovered three types of environment-friendly bacteria which can be used as a weathering agent during oil spills to prevent harm to the environment.
Tharaka says that he had stored these three types of bacteria in a laboratory at the university under a temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius to be used during an emergency situation. The find includes two types of bacteria known as Bacillus SP and another type known as Pseudomonas SP.
He says this bacteria can be utilised to prevent any environmental damage during an oil spill in the ocean or on land as a bio-remediation agent. He produced the bacteria by using soil and water samples soiled by petroleum waste at the Sapugaskanda oil refinery premises.
He conducted the research under the supervision and concept of Senior Lecturers Dr. Anil Jayasekara and Dr. Chandrika Nanayakkara.

Cry of Caesar
According to the ancient Roman calendar, the Ides fell on the 15th day of four months namely March, May, July and October and on the 13th in the other months.
To those who are familiar with the immortal works of the Bard of Avon or to those who some far distant day had occasion to use Julius Caesar as a literature text for the then SSC or the University Entrance, it rings a bell; in this context an ominous bell for it was the sinister greeting of the Soothsayer to the great Caesar.
In Julius Caesar Shakespeare has presented a man, a mere shadow of his former substantial self. A man not too popular with the populace enfeebled, subject to the falling sickness who exhorts mark Anthony come on my right hand for this ear is deaf. A man peeved at having had to refuse the crown yet retaining his hauteur.
In scene two of the first Act Caesar appears with his train in a public place, followed by a throng to the accompaniment of music when a voice shriller than all the music breaks through the crowd;
Beware the Ides of March
This is blood-tingling and there is in the lines a sense of undefined peril. On Caesar's inquiry as to who it was who called on him it is Brutus, Caesar's friend, who later turns conspirator under instigation from Cassius of the Lean and hungry look who in measured dispassionate tones transmits to Caesar the cry in the crowd.
A soothsayer bids you beware the Ides of March Here we see in Brutus the man in perfection. The ominous weight of the words is doubled as it emanates from him and the effect is almost electrifying by its innocent irony. Then we see the confrontation of Caesar and the soothsayer.
Caesar: What sayest thou to me Now speak once again.
Soothsayer: Beware the Ides of March
This incident strikes a note of mystery and the warning crates an impression of danger. But the great man indifferent to seeming trifles dismisses him with characteristic indifference.
He is a dreamer. Let us leave him But this indifference was to cost him his life.
Act three opens with the ominous; this time echoed by Caesar himself. In this hubris, he disregards all signs, omens and premonitions and proceeds to the Capitol almost snapping his fingers at fate and throwing back in the very face of the soothsayer, his prophecy of doom.
The Ides of March have come
But with equanimity, the soothsayer gives the repartee
Aye Caesar but not gone
And Caesar pompously proceeds to the Capitol only to receive a bloodbath and with a mighty fall to exclaim his famous last words
Et Tu Brute Then fall Caesar.

Dousing the embers of communal hatred
Peace is slowly returning to the troubled Central province after a week of communal discord that saw the loss of two lives and the destruction of property- and the imposition of a countrywide State of Emergency as well as a ban on several social media platforms.
The events highlighted in no uncertain terms that, despite the bitter experiences of a thirty year war in the North and East of the country, communal hatred is still alive and well. It also confirmed that there are organisations posing as patriotic groups who are willing to exploit these sentiments to achieve their own objectives.
Both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visited the Central Province in the aftermath of the clashes. President Sirisena met with officials to direct measures to curb the violence while Premier Wickremesinghe visited the affected areas to inspect first-hand the destruction caused by the riots.
Investigations are now underway to determine how the clashes gathered momentum and spread in such a short time. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that it was organised rather than spontaneous. Investigators point out that the road rage incident which triggered the violence in Digana occurred weeks before the rioting. Clashes did not erupt even when the victim died in hospital a week after the incident. They began only at the funeral of the victim.
Nevertheless, the government came in for harsh criticism from several quarters for the events first in Ampara and then in Digana and Teldeniya. It has been criticised for not being sufficiently prepared for the snowballing chain of events. The Police Department has been taken to task for not acting decisively enough to quell the violence when it first emerged.
National conflict
While some of these criticisms do raise valid concerns, the government did eventually enact measures that prevented the violence from escalating into a full blown national conflict that would have had disastrous consequences locally and internationally.
Authorities in government point out that on the one hand the government is accused of inaction and inefficiency while on the other hand it is also criticised for imposing a countrywide State of Emergency (instead of it being confined to either the Kandy district or the Central Province) and for restricting freedom of expression through the ban on social media platforms.
They point out that while these measures may be seen as draconian and excessive by some, had they not been imposed and had the violence spread to other regions, the government would have then been equally faulted for not taking steps that were stringent enough. The events of the past few weeks did also have its political implications. As is to be expected, there was polarisation along political affiliations in the reaction of political parties to the crisis. The main opposition grouping, the Joint Opposition (JO) in Parliament was quick to lay the blame at the feet of the government.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the de-facto leader of the JO seized the opportunity to criticise the government. The government should be held responsible for the events that take place in the country, Rajapaksa said. This shows the Governments inability. It has failed to control the riots, he said, claiming that during his tenure proper systems were in place which prevented incidents from spiralling out of control. Rajapaksa also visited Kandy and met with religious dignitaries there.
Even as the JO accused the government of inaction and inefficiency, the government has been quick to point out that it is the JO- and its offshoot Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) - which has been using communal sentiments to seek votes during election time.
Neither the JO nor the SLPP has been shy to play the communal card at the polls, frequently accusing the government of pandering to the minority communities. When such sentiments are constantly espoused, it takes only a minor skirmish to ignite communal clashes, they point out.
Among the other developments that emerged during the unrest was the appointment of Ranjith Madduma Bandara as Minister for Law and Order. This appointment came in the context of widespread calls for the appointment of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to this portfolio, after it was taken away from former Minister Sagala Ratnayaka. Minster Ratnayaka had been often blamed- rightly or wrongly- for the inefficiency in prosecuting offenders of the previous regime for alleged acts of corruption.
Parliamentarians of the United National Party (UNP) felt strongly that this failure played a significant role in the partys lacklustre performance at the recent local government elections. Hence the request to appoint Fonseka to the post.
With his military background, his proven credentials as an achiever and his ruthless efficiency in implementing an action plan, they felt Fonseka would be the ideal choice for the job, though they all respected Madduma Bandara as a loyal and senior party member.
In the week following the local government polls however, the political climate had undergone drastic changes. It is no secret that President Sirisena- whose mainstream Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) faction emerged a very distant third in the elections- was keen on reuniting the party for which the key was an amicable rapprochement with the JO, the SLPP and, most importantly, the Rajapaksas.
Law and Order portfolio
The appointment of Fonseka as Minister of Law and Order would directly conflict with such an objective because there is little love lost between the Field Marshal and the Rajapaksas during whose tenure the decorated war hero had to languish in jail. Thus, the majority of SLFPers vehemently opposed Fonsekas appointment to the portfolio.
With violence in the Central Province escalating the Law and Order portfolio- which had been temporarily assigned to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe- required permanent allocation. After several requests from the UNP to appoint Fonseka were declined, President Sirisena eventually appointed Ranjith Madduma Bandara to the ministry.
If the JO and the SLPP were upbeat following their performance at the local council elections, their image took a beating following two separate incidents this week. In the first, Southern Provincial Councillor M. K. Kasun and his wife Tharaka Perera were arrested and remanded for assaulting a private bus driver at Battaramulla. A video of Perera brandishing a pistol and brutally assaulting the driver went viral on social media. Kasun is a Rajapaksa loyalist.
In the second incident, Ramith Rambukwella, the cricketer son of another Rajapaksa loyalist, Keheliya Rambukwella, was also arrested for alleged drunk driving and assaulting two undergraduate students. He has now been released on bail. Rambukwella has a dubious track record of disciplinary indiscretions from the time he was a cricketer at Royal College to when he was representing Sri Lanka.
These two incidents gave rise to much debate in the media where critics were quick to hark back to the Rajapaksa era where law and order was at a low ebb and a favoured few behaved with impunity with callous disregard to the dignity of others. If these incidents occur when the JO is out of office, what would be the consequences if they are re-elected, these critics ask.
As the dust settles on the communal unrest in the Central Province, political parties will begin to take stock and evaluate their options once more. The moves by the JO to oust Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe- temporarily shelved, ostensibly due to this crisis but more likely because the JO did not have the required numbers- is likely to begin again. Sooner rather than later, it will be politics as usual as all parties look ahead to national elections in early and mid-2020.

Emergency law to lift after President returns
The lifting of emergency law in the country has been delayed until the return of President Maithripala Sirisena, currently on an official visit to Japan, Presidents Secretary Austin Fernando told the Daily News.
The gazette notification pertaining to the lifting of emergency law was to be issued yesterday (14).
However, as the President is overseas the relevant gazette is expected to be released on March 18 after the President returns from Japan on March 17.
Currently the country is peaceful and no incidents of violence have been reported during the past few days. The emergency had to be imposed on March 6 due to the racially motivated clashes that erupted in Kandy and Ampara recently.
The emergency law will be in force until the return of the President and the relevant gazette notification pertaining to its removal is issued.
Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said discussions are underway with regard to the lifting of emergency law. We are in the process of discussing with the security forces and police as well to see if they need time for their investigations. So under this situation, we may have to extend the emergency law by a few more days, he said.
He said while the country has returned to normal, emergency was being extended to facilitate the investigations that are being carried out.

Fitch rates DFCCs Basel III  Sub Debt Final A+(lka)
Fitch Ratings has assigned DFCC Bank PLCs (B+/AA-(lka)/Stable) proposed Basel III-compliant subordinated debentures a final National Long-Term Rating of A+(lka).
The final rating is the same as the expected rating assigned on January 29, 2018 and follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received.
The debentures, totalling up to Rs 7 billion, are to have maturities of five and seven years, and carry fixed coupons.
The notes include a non-viability clause and will qualify as regulatory Tier 2 capital for the bank. The bank plans to use the proceeds to support its balance sheet growth and to improve its capital adequacy in light of new regulatory requirements.
Fitch rates the proposed Tier 2 instrument one notch below the banks National Long-Term Rating of AA-(lka) to reflect the notes subordinated status and higher loss-severity risks relative to senior unsecured instruments.
The notes would convert to equity upon the occurrence of a trigger event as determined by the Monetary Board of Sri Lanka.
DFCCs National Long-Term Rating is used as the anchor rating because the rating reflects the banks standalone financial strength. Fitch believes that the banks standalone credit profile best indicates the risk of becoming non-viable.
Fitch has not differentiated the notching on the proposed notes from the notching on DFCCs legacy Tier 2 notes as we assume that the authorities would step in late, moving the point of non-viability close to liquidation.
Fitch has not applied additional notching to the notes for non-performance risk, according to Fitchs criteria, as they have no going-concern loss-absorption features.
The rating of the notes would move in tandem with DFCCs National Long-Term Rating.

Garbage management efforts: President keen on adopting Japanese technology
President Maithripala Sirisena said he looks forward to implementing the novel technology and technological advances used for garbage management by Japan, in Sri Lanka, for a permanent solution for issues relating to the garbage management sector.
The President made these remarks after visiting the Shinagawa Incineration Plant, a modern high-tech and state-of-the-art waste management plant in Tokyo, yesterday.
The Shinagawa Incineration Plant is one of the 23 plants which manages and recycles 11,000 Mt of garbage generated by 9.3 million people living in Tokyo daily.
Out of the 11,000 Mt of daily collected garbage, the Shinagawa Incineration Plant recycles 600 Mt daily in a high tech and people-friendly manner. The Shinagawa Incineration Plant has been designed and constructed in accordance with three principles of garbage management such as implementing an eco-friendly design, maintaining harmony with urban planning and promoting the national commitment to recycling.
According to the Chief Officer of the incineration plant, the plant is run by electricity generated through garbage recycling and the management process of the Shinagawa Incineration Plant. Excess electricity generated is sold to the national grid and it receives a significant income.
Moreover, it is significant that the Shinagawa Incineration Plant is situated in a highly urbanized area in Tokyo. Yet, no stench emanates from the plant due to the advanced technology used, the Officer said.
Having observed the plant, President Sirisena instructed Sri Lankan officials to look into the possibilities of establishing such a plant in Sri Lanka aiming to provide a permanent solution for garbage management. The President further instructed officials to gather information promptly in this regard.
Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva and Parliamentarian Ashu Marasinghe also participated in the observation tour.

Grim conclusions of largest-ever study of Fake News
Falsehoods almost always beat out the truth on Twitter, penetrating further, faster, and deeper into the social network than accurate information.
Falsehood flies, and the Truth comes limping after it, Jonathan Swift once wrote.
It was hyperbole three centuries ago. But it is a factual description of social media, according to an ambitious and first-of-its-kind study published recently in Science.
The massive new study analyzes every major contested news story in English across the span of Twitters existencesome 126,000 stories, tweeted by 3 million users, over more than 10 yearsand finds that the truth simply cannot compete with hoax and rumour. By every common metric, falsehood consistently dominates the truth on Twitter, the study finds: Fake news and false rumours reach more people, penetrate deeper into the social network, and spread much faster than accurate stories.
It seems to be pretty clear [from our study] that false information outperforms true information, said Soroush Vosoughi, a data scientist at MIT who has studied fake news since 2013 and who led this study. And that is not just because of bots. It might have something to do with human nature.
The study has already prompted alarm from social scientists. We must redesign our information ecosystem in the 21st century, write a group of 16 political scientists and legal scholars in an essay also published in Science. They call for a new drive of interdisciplinary research to reduce the spread of fake news and to address the underlying pathologies it has revealed.
How can we create a news ecosystem ... that values and promotes truth, they ask.
The new study suggests that it will not be easy. Though Vosoughi and his colleagues only focus on Twitterthe study was conducted using exclusive data that the company made available to MITtheir work has implications for Facebook, YouTube, and every major social network. Any platform that regularly amplifies engaging or provocative content runs the risk of amplifying fake news along with it.
Accurate news
Though the study is written in the clinical language of statistics, it offers a methodical indictment of the accuracy of information that spreads on these platforms. A false story is much more likely to go viral than a real story, the authors find. A false story reaches 1,500 people six times quicker, on average, than a true story does. And while false stories outperform the truth on every subjectincluding business, terrorism and war, science and technology, and entertainmentfake news about politics regularly does best.
Twitter users seem almost to prefer sharing falsehoods. Even when the researchers controlled for every difference between the accounts originating rumourslike whether that person had more followers or was verifiedfalsehoods were still 70 percent more likely to get retweeted than accurate news. And blame for this problem cannot be laid with our robotic brethren. From 2006 to 2016, Twitter bots amplified true stories as much as they amplified false ones, the study found. Fake news prospers, the authors write, because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.
Political scientists and social-media
Political scientists and social-media researchers largely praised the study, saying it gave the broadest and most rigorous look so far into the scale of the fake-news problem on social networks, though some disputed its findings about bots and questioned its definition of news.
This is a really interesting and impressive study, and the results around how demonstrably untrue assertions spread faster and wider than demonstrable true ones do, within the sample, seem very robust, consistent, and well supported, said Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, a professor of political communication at the University of Oxford, in an email.
I think its very careful, important work, Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College, told me. Its excellent research of the sort that we need more of.
In short, I dont think theres any reason to doubt the studys results, said Rebekah Tromble, a Professor of Political Science at Leiden University in the Netherlands, in an email. What makes this study different In the past, researchers have looked into the problem of falsehoods spreading online. Theyve often focused on rumours around singular events, like the speculation that preceded the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 or the rumours that followed the Haiti earthquake in 2010.
This new paper takes a far grander scale, looking at nearly the entire lifespan of Twitter: every piece of controversial news that propagated on the service from September 2006 to December 2016. But to do that, Vosoughi and his colleagues had to answer a more preliminary question first: What is truth And how do we know
Its a question that can have life-or-death consequences.
[Fake news] has become a white-hot political and, really, cultural topic, but the trigger for us was personal events that hit Boston five years ago, said Deb Roy, a media scientist at MIT and one of the authors of the new study. On April 15, 2013, two bombs exploded near the route of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring hundreds more. Almost immediately, wild conspiracy theories about the bombings took over Twitter and other social-media platforms. The mess of information only grew more intense on April 19, when the Governor of Massachusetts asked millions of people to remain in their homes as police conducted a huge manhunt.

Infertility medicine has not been developed: Medical professionals

A medicine to cause temporary infertility has not been developed yet, the undersigned medical professionals said today.
They said this at a media briefing held to clarify the myths pertaining infertility pills in Colombo.
Fertility in males and females is influenced by many factors. Medical drugs are only one factor which can potentially affect fertility the medical professionals explained.
Male fertility depends on the presence of adequate number of active spermatozoa which are normal in structure and function in seminal fluid.
When either the number of spermatozoa are reduced, or their function and mobility are impaired the ability to impregnate a woman is reduced and it results in sub-fertility (difficulty in conceiving a child).
Furthermore they said that similar factors may affect the fertility of a woman.
The medical professionals said that Pharmaceutical industry have been searching for a medical drug which can cause temporary infertility so that it can be used as a male contraceptive agent, similar to oral contraceptive tablets taken by women to prevent pregnancies.
And such a medicine has not been developed yet, the medical professionals emphasized.
However, some medicines used for other purposes may reduce the sperm count in men, or affect fertility in women as a side effect of their use. Such a reduction in fertility by these drugs can be reversed in most instances they added.
These drugs can only be obtained with a valid prescription from a registered doctor.
Furthermore, a single dose or a few doses of these medications are not adequate to cause significant changes in sperm counts or sperm function.
In essence, there are currently no easily available drugs or compounds in western medical practice which can significantly affect fertility, they said.

Japan and Sri Lanka to strengthen maritime cooperation

Japan will reinforce cooperation on maritime security with Sri Lanka, as well as support infrastructure and health projects there, in initiatives aimed at countering China's growing influence in the Indian Ocean.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed President Maithripala Sirisena Wednesday tohis residence, where they agreed to promote Tokyo's "Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy" and signed a memorandum of understanding for a 10.6 billion yen ($99.6 million) loan for health-related projects.
"By working together, we will make the Indo-Pacific an international commons that offers peace and prosperity for any country without discrimination," Abe said at a joint press conference. Sirisena added that the two countries will deepen their existing partnership.
At the meeting, Japan confirmed that it will offer support for infrastructure projects for ports, roads and energy in Sri Lanka. Tokyo also plans to send specialists to train locals in the health care and disaster prevention fields. The two countries agreed to closer communication on defense issues as well.
Sri Lanka will use the yen loan to build out national hospital facilities and encourage the use of medical devices like catheters. The funds will also be used to train doctors and other medical professionals to improve residents' health.
Abe also emphasized the necessity of the "maximum pressure" campaign on North Korea. Sri Lanka has diplomatic relations with Pyongyang. He requested Sirisena's help in resolving the longstanding issue of Japanese nationals abducted by North Korea as well.
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono also affirmed the importance of maintaining the maximum pressure line during a 70-minute meeting with his Sri Lankan counterpart, Tilak Marapana.
Located on a strategic sea lane around India,Sri Lanka is important toChina's Belt and Road Initiative linking Asia and Europe in one sprawling economic zone. Beijing has won concessions to use Sri Lankan ports.

The Judicature Act has been challenged in the Supreme Court by Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena and Prof, G. L. Peiris.
Gunawardena told the media that the Judicature Act which changes Sri Lankas judicial system has been presented to Parliament.
Gunawardana said the Government can legalise the Bribery Commission with the recently constituted Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID).This is the very dangerous scenario, he said.
He said the powers granted to the Attorney General to file a case will be granted to the Bribery Commissioner also under this new Judicature Act.
He further said the Attorney General decides in one case and the Bribery Commissioner decides in another case. Hence, in the face of equality, it will become unbalanced and inequal in law.

LG LAW NEEDS CHANGE AGAIN - MINISTER
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena yesterday called the newly introduced electoral system for Local Government Bodies as a national crime and stressed that it needs to be changed again.
Addressing an event in C.W.W. Kannangara Vidyalaya in Kurunegala, the minister said the newly introduced electoral system is against advanced democracy.
There was a public outcry against the preferential votes system and many civil organisations, political parties and community leaders urged to change the electoral system and re-introduce the electoral wards system.
A hybrid of the First-Past-the-Post (FPP) system and Proportional Representation (PR) system was worked out as a result. But it has become a national crime today, he said.
The total number of LG members surged from 4,000 to 8,000 and even a small child can understand that it was bad. The country cannot afford the additional expense. Some LG bodies have no space to hold council meetings, and they have financial constraints in increasing the seating capacity. The expenses for council meetings have soared and this is a waste of public money, he commented.
The minister said the Act has to be changed again rectifying the identified weaknesses. He said it is apparent that the new system is faulty.

A life dedicated to dance
A good dancer may impress an audience with technique and execution, but a great dancer would change your life, make you feel, bring you to tears and create a memory that would never fade, much like Vajira Chitrasena, who celebrates her 87th birthday today.
The audience knew her when she was just 15 years old; a young girl whose beauty matched her artistry. Backed by her guru and lover, this duo broke tradition and revolutionised Sri Lankas dance, which was stagnating under colonialism and lacking creativity and innovation.
The drummers and dancers were of the lower caste and society did not give them the respect they deserved. But Chithrasena came from the English speaking upper class and gave dance the respect it deserved, said Vajira, reminiscing about her late husband. Back in the day, female dancers did not possess much recognition, as they had to imitate male movements and wear costumes similar to those of men.
This duo shattered cultural stigmas and innovated and experimented new dance movements without harming traditions and culture. Chitrasena revolutionised the barren stage and introduced costumes, lighting and much more. This led to a new dance genre known as Sinhala Ballet, which involved movements to relate a story. Together, the couple produced more than 100 productions which include masterpieces such as Nala Damayanthi, Kinkini Kolama, Kindurangana and Chandali. With these productions taking centre-stage, female dancers grew day by day, while Vajira was a beacon of hope to young girls.
Apart from her career as a dancing professional, Vajira Chitrasena stands tall as a loving mother, caring grandmother and a gentle teacher, observing the moves of the students of the Chitrasena Dance Academy. While other families do their best to protect their heirloom, Vajira does the opposite by bestowing her knowledge on the younger generation. Her daughter Upeka continues this dancing tradition along with her granddaughter Thaji.
Most people say that Thaji looks like her grandmother, Upeka said.
Despite the success story of Vajira, the slow progress of the Chitrasena Kalayathanaya has raised much concerns. The land which was donated by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, was originally planned to accommodate six dance studios, a central auditorium, recording studio, accommodation facilities and a museum.
Yet, only the auditorium and the open-air hall had been constructed.
However, Vajira Chitrasena sits back proudly and enjoys her 87th birthday and a life dedicated to dance and passing on her legacy to the younger generation.

Meghan Markles First Royal Event
Meghan Markle has marked her first official royal engagement with the Queen as she joined the royal family in their annual Commonwealth Day celebrations today. As the symbolic head of the 53-country Commonwealth, Her Majesty attended an inter-faith service at Westminster Abbey, accompanied by Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William, Kate Middleton, Prince Harry and his fiance.
For Markle, the event arrives less than two weeks after she had her first official engagement with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the Royal Foundation Forum. It just goes to show just how quickly the future duchess is getting accustomed to her new royal life, and how well the royal family is welcoming her into their world.
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were seated in the row directly behind the Queen, Prince Philip, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William, and the Duchess of Cambridge during the event.
For the occasion, Markle and Middleton wore coordinating white and navy looks and the same navy suede pumps.
Markle was previously seen with the Queen for a Christmas Day service at St Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham. The outing also marked the Suits star's first photo op with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. She joined senior members of the royal family in celebrating the holiday at Her Majesty's Norfolk estate.
A week prior, Markle was invited to the Queen's pre-Christmas luncheon, where she rubbed elbows with about 50 members of the royal family at Buckingham Palace. Prince William, Kate Middleton, Prince George and Princess Charlotte were also in attendance; though they weren't photographed with Markle.
Markle had already met the Queen a few times before announcing her engagement to Prince Harry in November. "It's incredible.
I think, to be able to meet her through his lens, not just with his honor and respect for her as the monarch, but the love he has for her as his grandmother," she said in her first interview with her fianc.
"All of those layers have been so important for me so when I met her I had such a deep understanding, and of course incredible respect for being able to have that time with her, and she's an incredible woman," she added.

## Title: Meritocracy inalienable from good governance

Meritocracy inalienable from good governance
A leading newspaper which is 100-years-old, quotes in todays (March 13, pg 5) newspaper a Minister to say that Scientific Cabinet reshuffle after President returns. During the recent past the topics of much interest, discussion and debate have been on Constitutional amendments, National / Unity Government, Electoral Reforms, investigations on abuse, bribery and corruption, Cost of Living and Local and National elections. Many an article have been written and published along with media conferences with very little outcome!
However, on the presumption that all these have been dealt with or attempted to have been dealt satisfactorily or otherwise being resolved, much thought has to be given to what happens with the so called Cabinet Reshuffles. Respective election manifestos have been debated, publicized and popularized with loads of promises and good intentions. How much of these become realities with the cooperation of nation loving citizens more than with those with ones own self interests would be a good guess!
A wish of the entire majority in this country comprising of the honest citizens would be that there would truly be Good Governance in the country. This concept is not a prerogative of one political party or a group of them, as it has been in existence for quite some time and practised for better or worse.
At a time when the future is not known, predictions being made, which political party (ies) would predominate, who should be the President, the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition etc, it is time to open public debate on how Good Governance could be maintained. The election manifestos would have to, not only include same but also indicate how such would be implemented. There are many publications, theories, regulations on Good Governance, they will not produce the desired results if those responsible for such implementation are not appointed appropriately and obtain maximum possible cooperation from all parties represented in the Parliament.
Merit worthy qualities
It is of paramount importance that Good Governance should be operative from both top and bottom, at all levels and from all sides. Selections to important positions should not be on political bias, influence family connections and friendships but should be done appropriately purely on their own merit.
It is this aspect of MERITOCRACY I wish to highlight as the main ingredient for Good Governance, which ever political party, alliance or peramuna dominate. Merit is quite rightly often rated high for spiritual merit, thereafter for academic and professional. While this is correct, the last para of this article would also refer to other aspects of Merit relevant to Good Governance. In the appointment of Heads of Institutions in the Public Sector, Chief Executive Officers, Advisors, Commission/Council/Board members the keyword and criterion should be MERITOCRACY ie in simple words those possessing merit worthy qualities and those with (i) a proven track record on the subject, (ii) current involvement in the subject and (iii) a good vision, based on merit alone, irrespective of race, caste, creed, friendship, relationship, wealth/generosity, old school/campus ties etc.
As an apolitical citizen though many an article was written and published conveying views on Electoral Reforms under different themes, only a fraction of same would have been considered and implemented so far. We often hear the President, Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, recognised Political Party Leaders, inviting professionals to interact with Statesmen and politicians in decision making, it gave me at least some courage to write an article once again and sincerely hope that suggestions may be considered.
The general public at the outset should accept as history has shown that the country needs both Statesmen and politicians. The consideration of such would depend on President and Prime Minister in the formation of an effective reasonably sized Cabinet of Ministers.
With all due respect to President and Prime Minister, they may require some honest, competent apolitical advisers to suggest the composition. Also the views of the MPs in Parliament could be sought through a secret ballot by the President and the Prime Minister to identify the suitable persons irrespective of Party Politics.
The decisions may not result in 225 happy Members of Parliament and there would also be a few thousand loyalists also discontent but there would be a few millions quite content if correct decisions are taken. The first challenge would be to have a reasonably sized Cabinet of Ministers of about 25 MPs given the portfolios while undoubtedly a large amount would be disappointed unless they have the consolation of deputy ministries. Such a downsized Cabinet of Ministers from the general publics view point would not be just economic cost cutting, but from the point of view of Good Governance it will be effective coordination and output oriented.
Lack of coordination
At the moment lack of coordination of allied Ministries have cause conflict and retarded progress. If the reduction in emoluments and benefits could aggrieve some by losing their portfolios, such could be compensated to the deserving ones, either by increasing the emoluments to the deputy Ministers from the net savings of the down sized Cabinet provided the net result is definitely Good Governance. Some deserving Seniors may be even appointed as Senior Ministers without portfolios but to oversee a group of Ministries.
These divisions are very similar to those prevailing in neighbouring India, the S.A. regional countries and in many other countries in the developed world.
However, in the event through the provisions of the 19th Amendment for a National Government, the number of Ministries may not be critical, but for effectiveness of coordination of the subject areas under each portfolio listed, it would be most essential to have at least a competent person in the rank of an experienced Minister to coordinate each of the main subjects. See Table
Meritocracy has deep meaning in more than one way as eye openers when a current candidate has openly expressed that individuals are now seen better through these elections. Perhaps they are seen as Statesmen, politicians or opportunists and it is here that the voters too will have to have their eyes fully open as they vote in the future. In this connection during the Presidency of Elmore Perera, at the Organization of Professional Associations (OPA) about a decade ago, in 2008 a team of which I was a member, deliberated on a rational and scientific basis and a proposal for a 25 member Cabinet of Ministers was formulated, which has been subsequently deliberated at the National Movement for Social Justice.
As a finality on the activity of a Cabinet which would display its effectivity through MERITOCRACY where the main objectivity should be honesty and integrity, coupled with humility, creativity and credibility, in order to have validity, productivity and prosperity to the country, without the citizens facing undue austerity, should be the reality of such an entity and these facts are placed for posterity.

More teacher transfers at month end, says ministry
A batch of 5,473 teachers attached to Grades 611 in the same school for over 10 years will be given transfers to other schools at the end of this month, under the third stage of the teacher transfer programme, the Education Ministry said yesterday.
The ministry in a press release said nearly 38,000 teachers are presently attached to 353 national schools and nearly one-third of them, amounting to more than 12,000, have been serving in the same school for more than 10 years.
Although a transfer scheme operated for public servants every three or fire years, a large number of teachers suffered inconvenience due to the non-implementation of a teacher transfer scheme in respect of national schools.
As such, the scheme has been re-activated on the directions of Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and under the transfer scheme for teachers in Grades 611, a batch of 4,455 Sinhala-medium teachers and 1,018 Tamilmedium teachers will be subjected to transfers.
They will receive the transfer letters through their principals at the end of this month.
The release said that under the first stage of the transfer scheme implemented at the end of last year, 2,590 teachers in Advanced Level classes were transferred to other national schools; under the second stage implemented at the beginning of the year, 760 out of 1,441 teachers who had completed more than 10 years in the same station, were transferred.

A Memorandum of Understanding was signed yesterday between the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT) and the South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT) in order to promote the Port of Colombo collectively.
Addressing the MoU signing ceremony at the Ports and Shipping Ministry, its Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said although the Colombo Port operations are carried out under three terminals such as SLPA, SAGT and CICT, it is necessary to improve the image of the Port of Colombo to attract more shipping lines.
The MoU will encourage joint initiatives between the three terminals to carry out their operations towards the development of the Colombo Port as a transshipment hub for the region, said the Minister.
Speaking at the event, SLPA Chairman Parakrama Dissanayake said under this MoU, all three terminals will be able to share the resources to market and protect the greater interests of the Port of Colombo.
This is like a shipping alliance. We will compete with each other. But we will also cooperate with each other in order to ensure a better service for clients. So this is moving from competition to co-competition, said the Chairman.
Despite all the challenges and the growing competition of the region, the Port of Colombo would be able to achieve historic volumes under the guidance of the Minister, he said.
The Chairman added that the Port of Colombo witnessed an overall year-on-year growth of 16.4 percent during January. The transshipment growth was also historic in January which is 20.4 percent. The overall year-on-year growth in February is 19.4 percent and transshipment growth 23.4.

Profit after tax kept abreast at Rs. 9.6 billion. The significant growth in business volumes with an interest income of Rs.103 billion along with a gain of Rs. 1.1 billion from trading in government securities has contributed to this performance.
Aggressive implementation of marketing plans, investments on strengthening the brand, and prudent management of risk facilitated this performance. Demonstrating sound management of its credit portfolio, the gross Non-Performing Loans (NPL) ratio decreased to 1.3%, the lowest in the banking sector.
The Banks BASEL III total Capital Adequacy Ratio stood at 13.9%, as at December 31 and is expected to increase further once revaluation gains are considered. Alongside these achievements, the Bank prudently managed its expenses arriving at an impressive Cost-to-Income ratio of 38%. Adding to the trailblazing performance, NSB also made history by becoming the first specialized bank to amass an asset base of Rs. 1 trillion.
These achievements, as we celebrate our 46th anniversary, testify the robustness of the pragmatic strategic direction being pursued and augurs well for the future, stated Chairman, Aswin De Silva.

Sarvodaya Finance offers island-wide  ATM access via LankaPay ATM Network
Sarvodaya Development Finance Ltd., a leading financial firm in the forefront of micro finance industry, recently entered into a partnership with LankaPay Common ATM Network in a bid to facilitate island-wide ATM access to its discerning customers.
Incorporating cutting edge technology to boost its operations, Sarvodaya Finance will be offering the exclusive LankaPay solutions viz. LankaPay Shared ATM Switch (SAS) and LankaPay Card Management System (CMS). Marking the beginning of a monumental drive, Sarvodaya Finance will be one of the very first finance companies to partner with LankaPay Common ATM Network.
As a financial firm strategically guiding and leading the grassroots of the country towards a financially inclusive society, Sarvodaya Finance specializes in supporting Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises with a host of solutions.
With the advent of LankaPay solutions, Sarvodaya Finance customers can now benefit from gaining access to over 4000 ATMs across the country through LankaPay Common ATM Network.
Furthermore, the new service offers a hassle-free card management system with the convenience of cash withdrawal anytime from anywhere for a fraction of the cost.
At present, Sri Lanka has made considerable progress in terms of financial inclusion compared to its counterparts in the South Asian region.
However, a greater percentage encompassing those residing in the remote parts of the country as well as the disadvantaged communities are deprived of accessibility to quality life, and the exclusive services of mainstream banks and financial institutions.
Many factors impact a countrys financial inclusion viz. literacy level, age, distance to financial institutions, documentation, trust in formal financial institutions as well as and income level of individuals. Sri Lanka is currently in the process of devising a strategic plan to implement a nation-wide drive for boosting financial inclusion.
In line with the national plan spearheaded by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Sarvodaya Finance has stepped forward to mitigate the gap, by reaching out to the disadvantaged communities spread across the country through its numerous MSME solutions.
Expressing his views on the new partnership, Chief Executive Officer of Sarvodaya Development Finance, Dharmasiri Wickramatilake said, The new synergy formed with the countrys ATM network will positively contribute to enhance the financial inclusion at grass-root level, which in turn will support the overall economic growth of the country.
Financial inclusion should be a priority of a countrys economic system, as it involves the entire community including the disadvantaged groups into the mainstream financial system.
The drive will not only provide financial lending to launch a venture but will also bridge the gap of information asymmetry, providing the beneficiary with imperative financial know-how in order to conduct a business successfully.
Wickramatilake added, As breakthrough technologies emerge from time to time, we as a country are compelled to embrace the innovation and adapt our systems to keep abreast of the new developments.
Digitalization is dominating the financial industry and with the partnership with LankaClear we will be able to pass on the benefit of new technological developments to our Customers Island wide, where they can experience more convenient and hassle free service.
This milestone agreement will enrich our grass root level community towards financial inclusion and establish links with the financial industry.

Social media will be filtered of racial, religious discord - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that the government has no intention of banning Facebook, but certain measures will be taken and laws will be brought to ensure that it does not carry content aimed at disrupting communal and religious harmony.
The laws will provide legal powers to monitor and control social media usage restricting the contents raising communal and religious hatred and disharmony.
Many issues have arisen with the use of Facebook such as spreading fake news and ISIS terrorism propaganda, he said.
Both electronic and print media have to be abide by the laws of the country as well as media ethics. However, as signatories of universal human rights declarations, all countries are bound to respect freedom of expression. But, Facebook, Viber, Whatsapp are not subject to any such laws. Several governments are discussing what can be done to address this issue. On the other hand, there is no control of its use and we must enact laws to control it,the PM said.
I have informed the Foreign Affairs Ministry to discuss with representatives of these companies as well as other countries in our region which have the same issues that affected our country, to formulate a mechanism to overcome this problem. We took this decision to protect the countrys peace. We will soon remove the blockade on FB and other social media links.The Premier addressing the gathering after opening of a newly-constructed swimming pool at Isipathana College in Colombo said yesterday.
We can see positive and negative aspects of the social media through the incidents in Kandy recently. Since a small number of hotels are operated in the Kandy city, people in the area use to rent out rooms of their homes to tourists for profit.The entire Kandy city has shown tremendous progress in tourism thanks to social media such as Facebook, Viber, Whatsapp and other links. The tourism industry in Kandy collapsed due to the ethnic hatred messages prompted by the social media during the riots in Digana and Teldeniya, he said.
As a responsible government, we have a duty to take appropriate action in this regard. We did not want to ban social media. But there should be a mechanism to supervise these networks. We have also earlier informed the FB regarding these kind of activities, but they were slow to respond. However, a representative from FB will arrive in the country today to discuss these issues. In addition to this, we are discussing to formulate a mechanism to prevent the spreading of communal and religious hatred and disharmony. Both Law and Order Ministry and the Attorney Generals Department are working together to bring in new laws in this regard.
Currently, the UK has laws to curb spreading of communal and religious hatred. No one can create communal or religious hatred and disharmony. At the moment we are following international civil rights laws in addition to the normal laws in the country. Currently Germany, UK and Kenya has passed laws in controlling the social media.
I was instrumental in introducing Internet to Sri Lankans in 1993.I signed an agreement with former US Vice President Al Gore, when I was the Prime Minister then to bring internet to Sri Lanka. There are positive aspects of the social media which directly affect our economy, education communication and tourism. But on the other hand it has negative effects like spreading religious and communal disharmony creating violence and riots among the communities.
On the instructions of the Security Forces, we had to block the social media because they were spreading hate speech and amplifying them. False reports of ethnically motivated attacks circulating on the network has resulted in retaliatory violence.If we had not taken such measures the, the situation would have been worse. Due to this urgent measure, we have been able to lift the curfew within a short period, he added.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said measures have been taken to construct swimming pools in many schools out of Colombo during the past three years. Extra-curricular activities like swimming enables in developing balanced personality and minds of children. The old boys association of the Isipathana College had contributed for the project by allocating Rs.30 million.

SRI LANKA - FAILED AS A NATION
Where have we gone wrong
Lessons to learn for the future
Fine, we got rid of theBritish to rule ourselves. But are we actually leading a good life and have we set up thegovernance as we expectedor imagined, questionedProf Rajeev Bhargava.
Seventy years is too long a period to get something right. And yet Sri Lanka has been struggling for the last 70 years to get it right.
The Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS) recently held a discussion on 1948 Independence - what then and now for Sri Lanka and South Asia, to look at where exactly we have gone wrong and what lessons we can learn for the future.
A panel of Indian and Sri Lankan academics asked the question of whether Sri Lanka still remained as one of Asias most promising new countries as it was post 1948 or whether that hope has all but faded away.They looked back at the various opportunities that were forgone during the last 70 years whilst making an attempt to explain the way forward for Sri Lanka.
Director of BCIS, Dr HarindaVithanage delivering the opening remarks at the event said that there is always an idea of India but there was never an idea of Sri Lanka and added that while celebrating the 70th anniversary, Sri Lankans now needed to think of what Sri Lanka means to them.
He explained that, there were three things that are pushing Sri Lanka to create an Idea of Sri Lanka, they are; People, Politics and Position.
This revolved around how people would look at the future of Sri Lanka, how the politics should evolve or transform for a better change and finally the position of Sri Lanka - the security and the way forward, he said.
Concerns of a former leader
Participating at the event as the Chairperson of the Bandaranaike National Memorial Foundation (BNMF), Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumarathunga said she doubted whether the country was pedalling backwards and questioned whether the leaders achieved the dreams of Sri Lanka as a nation.
She pointed out that the dreams the leaders had when Sri Lanka received independence were not unattainable ones.
Sometime after the independence, we lost the main picture. It would be useful to reflect on that at this important juncture of history, she said.
Having built a stable democratic nation, we have not succeeded in forming a united State, she said, speaking about the failure of bringing together different communities under a common goal.
Three years ago, we were once again given the chance to rebuild, similar to what we had after Independence she said and called it a miracle in the political platform of Sri Lanka.
For the first time in history, the whole country got together to voice their opinion against one person and a ruthless regime. Two major political parties came together effectively with a clear vision to achieve what was required at the time and to implement good governance.
Even though the country had every possibility of achieving success according to the Former President, she said The question that remains is did we make use of that astonishing opportunity the country got three years before.
She ended her speech stating that it was the most difficult and complicated question that we, as Sri Lankans, at this moment need to find answers for.
South Asia PostIndependence
Speaking under the topic, Shaping of South Asia through Independence, the Director, Institute of Indian Thought, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), Delhi Prof Rajeev Bhargava said South Asians suffered from cultural subjugation due to their ignorance about their own traditions and religion.
Prof Bhargava explained that freedom is when someone is free from authoritative constraints - free from political, legal, mental and intellectual constraints.
He questioned the purpose of having freedom if one cannot live a life of his own choice. In the meantime, he said that the definition of freedom during pre-Independence was different to that of now.
Freedom then was to get rid of colonial rulers, to be free from colonial constraints - to develop in our own distinctive way and thats what freedom meant at that time, he said.
Prof Bhargava said that both Indians and Sri Lankans were successful in getting rid of British rule and they aspired to restore their culture and democratic rule.
Fine, we got rid of the British to rule ourselves. But are we actually leading a good life and have we set up the governance as we expected or imagined, he questioned.
He said in terms of India - the answer cannot be yes, In some aspects we have achieved but there is a long way to go.
Prof Bhargava opined that we, as South Asians tend to lapse into a political culture that we have inherited from the past which is not democratic - one of the aspects that distracted the country from moving smoothly along the direction towards democracy.
That is when he highlighted the need for leaders with the clear mind who would understand the situation of the citizens and who would make sure that they are leading a peaceful life.
We need smart leaders who could see and act better. Those who could stand in the shoes of the most vulnerable, he added.
He said that people are also accustomed to be ruled by powerful men (depending on which caste and tribe he belongs to) and have forgotten the concept of self-rule. As a result, cultural India is with Cultural Chief Ministers and Cultural Prime Ministers.
We need to be free from certain intellectual concepts in order to be truly free. This is happening particularly after political independence (after 1950s especially), the country is running after intellectual colonialism, he said.
Prof Bhargava was with the opinion that conceptual ideas and concepts do not sit very well with the cultural heritage as he observed the swing from hyper westernization on one hand to cultural and traditional practices on the other.
According to him, one of the problems that South Asians need to tackle is their tendency of trying to become second hand Europeans or Second hand Americans.
We are still living in a cultural environment as second hand Europeans and some others as second hand Sri Lankans or second hand Buddhists, he said.
Contemporary Scenarios
After Independence - Sri Lanka was getting kudos as a third world country - blessed with universal adult franchise, our GDP was comparatively high and the economy opened up before many other neighbouring countries, said Former Foreign Secretary H. M. G. S. Palihakkara.
But somewhere down the road, the country faulted whilst other more smaller and larger have overtaken Sri Lanka.
History then and now is compiled of few successes and several failures on part to implement democracy and practice democracy, he noted.
Speaking of peace as a country and as well as a region, he questioned whether we were truly at peace.
Are we at peace now - As a country and as a region - new nuclear dimensions have been added to our regions - they are one of our concerns. Its already a conflict prone region, there is a need to worry about the South Asian security scenario. After Independence, two South Asian countries have become nuclear powers, he said.
One of Palihakkaras concerns was that there was no structure or a regional forum to discuss and negotiate problems or mitigate rising issues.
He further explained that that there was a significant shift between then and now - things considered inclusively domestic are not domestic anymore, they have become matters of external scrutiny.
The Maldivian issue, Sri Lankas military action and Nepals domestic affairs are before the United Nations Security Council  this was not the situation before Independence. At present, globalization, connectivity, civil society activism, diaspora and externalization have a lot to do with the leadership of these countries, said Palihakkara.
Lacking a shared idea of Sri Lanka
Emeritus Professor, University of Colombo Prof Jayadeva Uyangoda echoing Dr Vithanage said, when speaking of the Socio - political Transformations in Sri Lanka with reflections on South Asian cases, that we as Sri Lankans never had an articulated and shared idea of Sri Lanka.
Sometime back, a diplomat asked me how the Indian government could help Sri Lanka as the leaders are also in the process of drafting a new Constitution. I said, invite them for three months and make them read the Indian Constitution - thats the only help the Indian government could do, he said.
We lost many opportunities every time we drafted a new Constitution - we did not have the foresight to have an idea of Sri Lanka. The idea and vision for Sri Lanka - is constructed on the basis of the past but the Constitution is for the future. The Constitution should embody the normative goals of ideals, added Prof Uyangoda.
In the meantime, Prof Uyangoda said, democracy has not been able to penetrate deep in Sri Lanka and it always revolved around civil society groups and political parties.
Foreign Policychallenges ahead
Deputy Director, Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS) George I. H. Cooke began his presentation stating that making the island a hub is not a new policy but one which needs to be revived and revisited.
To which he explained, numerous calls were made to make Sri Lanka a hub in the Indian Ocean, but often we fail to realize that Sri Lanka was a hub of strategic importance. Traders from China, the Arab world, as well as the Portuguese, Dutch and British found the island to be of importance and some sought to exert influence and control it to their benefit at various periods.
Cooke pointed out that it is time to look at the past, understand the current and plan for the future.
In our context, emphasis on research into how Sri Lanka strode the global stage, the measures undertaken, the international developments at the time, the tight balancing act that the country had to follow, all become relevant as the country celebrates its 70th anniversary of independence, he said.
According to Cooke, today Sri Lanka is a member, dialogue partner and observer of numerous organizations and groupings, yet the amount of leverage the country enjoys internationally, as a result of such affiliations, leaves much to be desired and he added that it is time the country surges ahead, but it would only be able to do so with a policy of pragmatic strategizing, which it tends to lack at the most crucial of times.
Cooke, thus observed that identifying national interest was at the center of decision making and that whether in negotiations over bilateral issues, staking a claim at the United Nations or through the plethora of multilateral platforms that Sri Lanka sits at, the prospect of going in with an agenda for success, rather than merely marking attendance, needed to be at the top of list of priorities.
Security remains critical, from defence of the island from outside interference; cyber attacks; protecting maritime boundaries and resources; preserving peace, law and order within the island; ensuring a healthy population; securing sufficient food; avoiding economic downturns; promoting investment while protecting the environment. All of these dimensions of security are paramount for a country going forward, he explained.
He further said that the goal of Sri Lanka - First irrespective of who or what we are dealing with needs to be a constant in foreign policy formulation.
Cooke noted that the State needed to rethink its objectives  rethink formulation and rethink implementation - in creating a clear, concise and considered course, thus it was prudent for the island to adopt a foreign policy formula.
If Sri Lanka and her policy makers dont put the country first, no one else will, he said almost echoing the main issue around why, we as a nation have failed for the last 70 years.

There is not  enough women in  Tomb Raider
Alicia Vikander has admitted that there is not enough women in her new Tomb Raider movie.
The Oscar winner stars in the rebooted Lara Croft movie but she was asked about the lack of women in the film which is known for its incredibly strong and empowering lead character, and she revealed she was left wondering during filming where the women were.
I got to work with Kristin Scott Thomas and she is an extraordinary actress, but me too, I agree, she told Alex Jones on The One Show who told Alicia that she was slightly disappointed that you were this brilliant main lead and then everyone else, bar two minor roles, were men again, she said. I was on the island and I was thinking, there are not enough women. I was running around looking for them! she added.
Alicia previously claimed that the rebooted version of the 1990s game would pass the Bechdel test, revealing that the film actually has relationships and stories; the Bechdel test is an effective parameter in testing whether a film is sexist  and requires a movie to have two women that talk to each other about something other than a man in order to pass.
The new movie will follow Lara as a a 21-year-old bike messenger who leaves behind her old life to look for a fabled tomb off the coast of Japan in order to find her eccentric father, who vanished when she was a teenager. Tomb Raider is out on March 15. Metro

TISL urges govt to lift ban on social media
Transparency International Sri Lanka yesterday urged the government to lift the ban on social media.
Speaking on the subject, TISL Executive Director Asoka Obeyesekere noted, "The government must act immediately to remove the ban on social media and instead focus on holding those responsible for hate speech and inciting violence to account under the ICCPR Act. Instead of blocking social media, the government should be using it as a communication tool."
Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) is alarmed by the continued blocking of social media and other communication tools on the orders of the government and calls on the government to immediately reinstate access, the anti-corruption watchdog said in a statement. In spite of reassurances that the ban will be lifted by the end of the week, the prevailing discussion on moves to regulate social media platforms also provides cause for concern. While the move may have been well-intentioned, continuing to prevent the free flow of information is not a means by which to address deficiencies in maintaining law and order.
Such concerns can be addressed by ensuring the enforcement of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act, which strictly prohibits advocacy on national, racial or religious hatred and makes it a non-bailable offence. The present blocking of social media amounts to an arbitrary action on a wide group of citizens, when there seems to be an unwillingness to action the law against those who create hate speech and instigate racial tension. Targeting the individuals involved in hate speech, as opposed to social media platforms, will result in a just and equitable outcome, TISL said.

Trump fires Tillerson, names CIA chief as successor
Donald Trump on Tuesday sacked his top diplomat Rex Tillerson and named current CIA chief Mike Pompeo to succeed him, ending a rocky tenure by the Texas oilman who had frequently been at odds with the mercurial US president.
A senior White House official said Trump wanted to reshuffle his team with a view to launching talks with North Korea, following last weeks spectacular announcement that he plans to meet Kim Jong Un by the end of May.
While Trump thanked Tillerson for his service, he was sparing in his praise of the 65-year-old former Exxon chief, long rumored to be on the way out.
Before leaving on a trip to California, Trump spoke openly of their differences -- singling out the Iran nuclear deal -- as he explained the rationale for the latest departure from his chaotic White House.
We got along actually quite well but we disagreed on things, Trump told reporters. When you look at the Iran deal, I thought it was terrible, he thought it was okay. - AFP

Two paedophiles arrested
Two suspects who had allegedly subjected underage boys in Balangoda to serious sexual abuse were arrested by Balangoda Police at Mahiyangana recently.
Investigations revealed that they allegedly prey on unsuspecting underage boys in Balangoda by befriending them through Facebook and taking them to other areas, by providing money and mobile phones as inducements.
More recently, on or around February 22, they had allegedly abducted two 14-year-old boys resident in Belihuloya and Kirindigala and brought them back to Balangoda, after abusing them for several days. The parents of these two boys had even complained to the grama niladaris of the respective areas that the boys were missing from home.
Police said the two children were produced before the Ratnapura JMO who reported that they had been subjected to severe sexual abuse. Ratnapura SSP Buddhika Siriwardene said he had requested the OIC of Ratnapura Police Children and Womens Bureau too to investigate this matter and submit a report.

US Ambassador to the United Nations slams Russia over spy poisoning in Britain

US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Wednesday the Trump administration "stands in absolute solidarity with Great Britain" following a nerve agent attack against a Russian double agentand his daughter in the English city of Salisbury last week.
In the strongest statement yet from the US administration on the affair, Haley said Washington shared the UK's assessment that theRussian state was behind the poisoningand demanded a firm international response.
"The United States believes that Russia is responsible for the attack on two people in the United Kingdom using a military-grade nerve agent," Haley said in her remarks at a UN Security Council emergency session, blasting the Russian government for flouting international law.
"If we don't take immediate concrete measures to address this now, Salisbury will not be the last place we see chemical weapons used," said Haley. "They could be used here in New York or in cities of any country that sits on this council."
The United Kingdom believes Russia was behind the attempted murders of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia because thenerve agent used, Novichok, was developed in the Soviet Union and could not be replicated by non-state actors. London announced Wednesday it wouldexpel 23 Russian diplomatsafter Moscow failed to meet a UK deadline to give a "credible response."
Russia has dismissed the accusations as "fairy tales" and denied any involvement in the attack which landed the Skripals, along with a British police officer, in the hospital.
Moscow's ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, even suggested the UK might have been responsible for the attack in an attempt to smear Russia. "In the Russian Federation, no scientific research or development work under the title Novichok were carried out," he told the Security Council.
"The most probable source origin this chemical are the countries which have since the end of the 90s been carrying... out intensive research on these kinds of weapons, including the UK."
But Haley laid the blame firmly at Russia's door. Highlighting Moscow's support of the Assad regime in Syria following that government's use of chemical weapons against civilians, Haley told fellow diplomats the world had reached "a defining moment."
"Time and time again, members states say they oppose the use of chemical weapons under any circumstance," said Haley. "Now one member stands accused of using chemical weapons on the sovereign soil of another member. The credibility of this council will not survive if we fail to hold Russia accountable."
Presenting Britain's case, Deputy UK Ambassador to the UN Jonathan Allen called the attack "an unlawful use of force" and invited representatives from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to conduct an independent investigation of the incident.
Nebenzia, Russia's envoy, reaffirmed his government's denial of involvement in a lengthy and colorful response.
He called on the UK government to offer proof that Novichok was used and that Russia was responsible, and slammed UK Prime Minister Theresa May for making "completely irresponsible statements" and "threats."
In questioning London's allegations, Nebenzia cited the English fictional detective Sherlock Holmes and his "hapless" Scotland Yard counterpart, Inspector Lestrade.
"Lestrade latches on to something that is on the surface of a crime and is in a hurry to provide banal conclusions only to be overturned by Sherlock Holmes, who always finds what is behind the crime," Nebenzia said. "I do think we could all stand to benefit from having a Sherlock Holmes with us today."
With apparent sarcasm, Nebenzia also suggested the UK government should look inward to determine why Russian nationals in the country so often find themselves in mortal peril, and mocked Haley's credibility as "an experienced chemist."
The White House later backed up Haley's comments at the UN, saying it shared the British assessment of Russia's culpability in the Salisbury attack. "The United States stands in solidarity with its closest ally, the United Kingdom," the statement read.
"This latest action by Russia fits into a pattern of behavior in which Russia disregards the international rules-based order, undermines the sovereignty and security of countries worldwide, and attempts to subvert and discredit Western democratic institutions and processes."

A welcome move
As the name implies, the World Wide Web (WWW) is a borderless, limitless web of information available worldwide. The WWW is only around 25-years-old, though the Internet itself goes back to 1969. The WWW has truly revolutionized our lives during the last quarter century, with any information just a mouse click away. Thanks to the power of the Net, we can talk for free to a person on the other side of the world or get a cab to our doorstep in minutes.
But like everything else in life, the Internet comes with a few caveats. The biggest concern is that not everything one can find in the Net is true. The sprawling nature of the Internet means that it is very difficult to monitor and control the massive flow of information that originates from thousands of different physical locations. Geography has no bearing on the Internet  if you have a smartphone or computer, you can reach out to billions of people at once.
Two events that took place more or less a decade ago have had a profound effect on our lives. The establishment of Facebook in 2004 changed forever the way we interact with the Internet. Here was an opportunity to express our thoughts for our friends and associates to see and share. We could upload those vacation pictures to make everyone go green with envy. We could chat and share files. The new term social media was coined to encapsulate what all this was about. Facebook was followed by the likes of Twitter (2006), Instagram and communications-oriented apps such as Whats App.
The other major event was the invention of the smartphone. Suddenly, the power of the Internet was in our hands  literally. Facebook has since expanded astronomically to over 2.2 billion active users as handset prices fell rapidly.
Facebooks biggest problem was that there was nobody to curate its content or verify the accuracy. It soon became the favourite medium for spreading disinformation, hate, outright lies and what later came to be known as fake news. These are items that appear to be true but which are manifestly false, targeted at influencing the public and changing public opinion. CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself has admitted that Facebook is working to fix this major problem.
It was well known for some time that several groups based in Sri Lanka and abroad were using Facebook and several other social media platforms to spread animosity among various communities and religious groups. Among them were many Sri Lankans living abroad who have little or no idea of the ground realities back home. This was a dangerous game that could arouse communal and religious passions.
True to these fears, it was found that Facebook et-al had been used as a tool to incite hate among the Sinhala and Muslim communities in Ginthota, Ampara and Digana, the three recent flashpoints of violence. The Government was quick to curtail access to Facebook and certain apps such as Whats App and Viber in order to contain hate messages. By and large, the public, the media and even the Opposition accepted this as a timely decision. Several persons including schoolboys who posted inflammatory material on Facebook have been taken in for questioning.
Contrary to Opposition allegations that the Government was planning to extend the ban on Facebook for political reasons, several ministers have revealed that full access will be allowed by Friday. Whats App and Viber are already online. There is no doubt that extending the blockage any further would have been economically and socially damaging as thousands depend on these platforms for communication and business.
However, a general consensus has emerged that a mechanism should be evolved to monitor Facebook etc. Hence the authorities are mulling a proposal to set up an institution to monitor social media usage with a view to preventing hate speech. No one can find fault with this rational decision, because the freedom of expression should not be used to spread hate against a particular community or religious group.
There are indications that Facebook itself has taken the incidents in Sri Lanka and its role therein seriously. A team from the social media giant will be visiting Sri Lanka this week to discuss this issue with the authorities and take appropriate action from their side. One concern they have expressed is the lack of personnel conversant in Sinhala to identify hate posts. This can no doubt be addressed by having an office in Sri Lanka itself. Incidentally, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, the only Sri Lankan to have held a top position at Facebook recently criticized it saying we have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.
Chamaths words are almost prophetic in the context of Sri Lanka, where extremists on all sides as well as bankrupt politicians have attempted to rekindle ethnic fires. Our future will be very bleak if we allow them to destroy the very bonds of unity that hold our multi-ethnic society together. These sinister attempts must be defeated at all costs.

WHATSAPP WORKING NOW, OTHERS TO FOLLOW
Restrictions placed on the social media platform, Whatsapp was removed as of midnight yesterday (14), Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRCSL) Chairman and Secretary to the President, Austin Fernando said.
The Whatsapp messaging service was partially restricted with the sharing of multimedia, videos and calls being banned on the platform since March 7.
The Presidents Media Division (PMD) in a statement said that in the last few days social media had been used to promote racial tensions and violence across the country and that the government had implemented the ban on many social media platforms as a temporary measure to control the situation.
