Honest politicians will be respected by the people: President
The world today is not governed by monarchy, but it has a true democratic system. Therefore, politicians who take the leadership in this context should always have the qualities of democracy, said President Maithripala Sirisena.
The President was speaking at a ceremony to felicitate former Minister Raja Samaranayake, at the Maithri Hall in Bandaragama on Wednesday.
Though power and corruption go hand in hand, it is the honest politician who will be honoured by the people. Former Minister Raja Samaranayake is a good example for such a politician, the President said.
Through the felicitation for ideal political characters such as Raja Samaranayake, the government aims to respect them as well as use them as examples and role models for todays politicians, he said.

Samaranayake showed his unwavering commitment for the development of education by making budgetary allocations for every school in the electorate, he said.
Samaranayake who is a corruption free, honest, efficient and exemplary leader entered into active politics on an invitation from former Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake. He contested the Bandaragama electorate from the UNP in 1977 and was elected to Parliament with 28,097 votes.

The death of Ranjith Peiris in a local hospital took the toll to eight after the city witnessed changing weather conditions after last weeks storm. The storm caused rain-sodden ryegrass pollen grains to explode and disperse over the city, with tiny pollen particles penetrating deep into lungs.
Peiris son Roshan said his father was conscious for 45 minutes but struggled to breathe and suffered from asthma and lost consciousness.
All up, we waited an hour and 10 minutes, and my dad was conscious for about 45 minutes trying to breathe, he said.
They kept saying on the phone, They are on their way. But he never recovered from that time, he added.
After the asthama crisis, health authorities are now under pressure to explain why they they didnt warn the public about the asthma disaster.
Over 8,000 patients with respiratory problems and many people are admitted in the hospitals in the city on the night of the outbreak. Most of them had to wait more than half an hour for an ambulance to arrive. - PTI

Free vocational training from next year
Vocational raining will be offered free of charge as an extension of the free education system in the country, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
We have found that certain institutions like the Ocean University and Vocational and Vocational Training Authority have been offering courses for a fee. Technical education, like other avenues of education should be offered free, Minister Samarasinghe told a media briefing at the ministry yesterday.
He said the 2017 Budget had allocated Rs. 300 billion to provide investments to offer all courses free of charge from next year.
A government circular released by the Public Administration and Management Ministry also recognised the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) level 3 and 4 certificates as being similar to O/Ls and A/Ls qualifications when recruiting candidates for technical jobs in the government service.
The Cabinet in June approved the proposal to have the NVQ level 3 certificate to be equivalent to O/Ls and the NVQ level 4 certificate being equivalent to A/Ls.
Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said this will help in the policy in making 13 years of schooling compulsory.
Not all will go into the traditional fields of study, thus we must also include technical subjects in the curriculum. With these changes, they will have the opportunity to find work in the technical field, he said.
We have 2,20,000 students every year not qualifying for university. Meanwhile, we need a trained and qualified labour force to meet our sustainable development goals and to make our country more attractive to foreign investors, Minister Samarasinghe said.

MR should not be allowed to destroy SLFP: Vijithamuni
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should not be allowed to destroy the SLFP. Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna members are trying to forcibly use the former Presidents goodwill to promote their party and destroy the SLFP, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Gamini Vijithamuni Soysa said.
Speaking at a press conference at the Irrigation Department Auditorium yesterday, Soysa said the President had said that trade union members should not participate in activities harmful to the country and that he was ready to negotiate with them and find a solution to their issues. Speaking on the alleged military coup, the minister said such rumours are made to discredit the tri forces and the country.
The Tri Forces made many sacrifices to end the war. No one has the right to level allegations against Tri Forces personnel, he said.
SLFP will form committees from December 4. Delegates will be appointed for each committee to ensure a SLFP victory at future elections, Soysa said.
He also said the PH value of the Seethawaka River in Kitulagala has increased due to pollution.

Sir Ponnambalam Ramanthans 86 death anniversary: Chauvinism has no place in politics - SP Governor
Malicious attempts of certain politicians to snatch political power through communal ideologies will never succeed. Mean elements will not be able to spread communal hatred and resentment among the people as every citizen aspires to live in a peaceful and united Sri Lanka, Southern Province Governor Dr. Hema Kumara Nanayakkara said.
He observed so delivering the key note address at the 86th death anniversary of Sir Ponnambalam Ramanatan at the Southern Province Governors secretariat auditorium on Wednesday.
Governor Dr. Nanayakkara said scholars with great humane qualities are infrequent. Compassionate people light up the world for ages. Sir. Ponnambalam Ramanathan was such an exceptional politician cum academic. He was a prominent personality who fostered and maintained a compassionate vision and mission towards the world void of trivial ethnic, creed and caste prejudices. It is our obligation and duty to pay homage to such a personality at his 86th death anniversary, the Governor said.
He said Sir Ponnambalam was raised in a cultured milieu and nurtured under methodical parents. Due to his in-depth education gained through prestigious educational institutions, he earned reputation as an international academic.
He was a man of practicality and dignity. His eloquent speeches at the Legislative Council were as terrifying as lions roars that frightened British rulers. Colonial rulers tried to suppress the basic human rights of the people. Sir Ramanthan voiced against such vicious acts, Dr. Nanayakkara said.
Governor Nanayakkara said: It is rarely that a nation gets epoch-making personalities. Their vision and mission pave the way for nations forward march. Descended from a Tamil family, he came forward to defend the rights and privileges of Sinhala Buddhist at times when their liberties were threatened. He continued his mission upholding patriotic approaches shunning chauvinistic ideologies and attitudes. With regard to his contributions for the uplift of the Sinhala community and Buddhism, the nation is indebted to this illustrious and erudite intellectual who is well reminisced in hearts and souls of all.
Prisons Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M.Swaminathan also spoke.

Air Force accepts two PT-6 Aircraft after overhaul
The first two PT-6 Aircraft overhauled at the Aircraft Overhaul Wing at Sri Lanka Air Force Base, Katunayake, were accepted by Air Force Commander Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy at Katunayake yesterday.
The Aircraft Overhaul Wing was established early this year with the technical assistance of M/S CATIC. The Chinese specialist will assist and guide the SLAF in establishing the facilities in the first few overhauls. They will withdraw gradually, leaving the SLAF with the capability to handle overhauls.
Technology transfer is a common practice in most countries where foreign origin aircraft are inducted and used. The practice permits the user nation to ensure longevity of the platforms that they acquire without having to rely on foreign assistance and having to dispatch aircraft overseas at great expense.
