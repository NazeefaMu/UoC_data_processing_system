Festive bashes are best sans the drunken pest!
Most of us love this time of year. Everyone relaxes and parties with lots of invitations to both big and little get-togethers. Christmas Day may be no longer than any other day, but for many people, the festive party season now lasts the whole of December. We all want to have fun and indulge every now and then, especially at Christmas time, but sometimes its hard not to get carried away.
After all, it is meant to be the season to be jolly. But no one in their right senses would like to see anyone jolly-well smashed. I mean really sloshed, inebriated, stoned, plastered or drunk as a skunk as they say.
Imbibed judiciously alcohol can be an effective social lubricant. But being under the influence is impolite in any social circle. Besides, becoming drunk and disorderly can become a nightmare for fellow guests and hosts. In any case, imbibing copiously and becoming cruel, mean or violent is inexcusable. Yes, we have all dealt with that one embarrassingly drunk person in otherwise polite company who is unable to hold his or her liquor and seems bent on ruining an otherwise convivial party.
 In vino veritas is a Latin phrase that translates in wine there is the truth. This is linked to the important question of drunken comportment. The way we act when drunk is a litmus test of our general behaviour. Alcohol brings out underlying manners.
This is how certain men and women choose to behave when fuelled by the lack of restraint after drinks. Depending on their disposition, they might grow taciturn and weep into their cocktail. No one wants to see grown men crying when everyone else is in gales of laughter and having a great time.
There is the ideologue drunk who is always spouting his political, religious or philosophical views, which are usually very extreme, in purely social situations. The groper is usually a male guest who gets too friendly and cant keep his hands to himself. He keeps touching and pawing much to the annoyance of a female guest or several of them. Lets be clear about this kind of party animal. This behaviour verges on sexual harassment and must not be tolerated.
It would be a good idea to eject him from the party soon after the infraction, provided he hasnt already been assaulted by the womans husband or boyfriend. The worst of these are the drunk and violent types. This person gets drunk then belligerent. And, nothing can ruin a party more quickly than a fight.
Learn to hold your liquor at whatever cost. Even if the drinks are flowing freely, avoid drinking too much. Few things are as disrespectful and uncomfortable at a party as a drunk, obnoxious guest, particularly at more elegant affairs.
To all these characters instead of having a good time the fashion is to be a nuisance. That is bad manners as well as being technically discourteous.
But rather than embracing festive merriment, many revellers simply resort to base behaviour  being abrasive and insulting, brawling, vomiting and urinating in public. Public intoxication charges, often called being drunk and disorderly, is a legal charge alleging that a person is visibly drunk or under the influence of drugs in public.
It is usually a misdemeanour crime under the law. Public intoxication laws exist to prevent people from disturbing others and misbehaving in public and to remove people who appear to be unable to stop themselves from hurting themselves or others.
Yet alcohol is a capricious character, flipping from faithful sidekick to spiteful psychopath in the space of a few small sips  and its unpredictability is particularly acute at Christmas.
With the holidays come family gatherings, office parties, socialising with friends and get-togethers. These are occasions we look forward to all year. But there can be a dark side to the holiday cheer: Drunk driving and the injuries and deaths that result.
Every December we see a spike in highway fatalities during the Christmas and New Year holiday periods. These appalling grim figures do not reflect the other horrific consequences of such accidents such as a child's loss of a parent, a wife's loss of her wage-earning husband, and the severe injuries and lost income innocent passengers may suffer.
Most of us enjoy hosting holiday parties for friends and family. However, with the decision to serve alcoholic beverages comes the responsibility to make certain our guests don't leave the party so impaired that they are unable to drive safely.
Keep an eye on your guests as you circulate during the party. If you observe someone take more than one or two alcoholic drinks or you see someone who shows signs of intoxication, be positive. Determine whether the person expects to drive himself home. If so, intervene and ensure that a sober driver takes him.
Many of us know family members or friends who drink too much at holiday parties. You recognise your husband, friend, brother or sister risk his or her life and the lives of others when he or she gets behind the wheel in an intoxicated state. Stick to the old safety adage: If you drink dont drive. If you drive dont drink!
Yes, it largely depends on you. For your own safety, think twice before you travel the roads and highways late at night during the holidays. There are more intoxicated drivers on the road in the late evening and early morning hours.
Contrary to what you might think you can party up a storm over the holidays and do it mindfully
Yes and you will stand out from the rest as the responsible man who can hold and handle alcohol just as he can handle everything else in life with total class and respect. Mindfulness means being truly present for the moments of our lives on every level body, mind and soul. So as you party and play, stay connected to yourself in the present moment - so that you feel and experience the true spirit of celebratory bonhomie and fellowship.
When your energy is high, go for it  play and dance and laugh and share and revel in the energy of celebration! Go with the flow of festivity and soak it all up. The great thing about mindful merrymaking is that you stay in touch with yourself. So you see, the silly season can be a celebratory, toppingly mindful time that can leave you feeling light, refreshed and happy.

Festive ferrets
A furry ferret is the star of his very own super cute calendar, and has already been paid $3000 ahead of the holidays.
Moose, a four-year-old ferret, is the face of the Modern Ferret, an annual calendar which was founded by his owners Haley Pearson and Channing Shattuck. He poses in photos with his siblings Newt and Albert, two, wearing adorable pint-sized outfits including football jerseys and Christmas sweaters to represent every month.
Haley and Channing, who are both industrial designers, kick-started the calendar after adopting Moose in 2014, to change the publics negative perceptions of ferrets.
The couple, of Lincoln, Nebraska, USA, have already raked in $2,932 in calendar sales this year which sell online for $34 a pop or $52 for an enormous 19 inch by 27 inch version.
Haley, 26, said, We got the idea to do the calendar because we were having such a positive response to our Instagram page and we saw the demand. We take the bulk of the photos in the space of a few weeks. Our calendars are themed, for instance Valentines day is pink and two of our ferrets are hugging. Thats a favourite. For the Christmas shoot, we dress the ferrets up in Christmas sweaters. I make them berets and sports gear at the beginning of football season. Its really fun. We started our Instagram page a couple of years ago to change peoples perceptions of ferrets. There are a lot of misconceptions out there about ferrets. People think that they bite, or that they smell. Theres also this perception that ferrets are like rats or that theyre rodents which isnt true. In fact they are predatory animals. Their closest wild relative is actually the European Pole Cat. They make such sweet pets.
This year, the proceeds of the calendar will help Moose meet his biggest fan Ellen Telostrom, 14, a ferret fan who lives almost 700 miles away in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin.
Ellen was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome at age 10, a group of disorders that affect the bodys connective tissues.
The teenager, who first connected with Haley and Moose on Instagram three years ago, was heartbroken when her own beloved ferret Noodles, seven, died in November.
Haley said, We are going to use all of the proceeds to visit a girl in Wisconsin who is living with a chronic disease. She lost her ferret earlier this year and is a big fan of Moose so were going to use the money to visit in the Spring. We were fully funded in 36 hours after people connected with her story.
Ellens mum Kathy Telostrom, 55, said the visit is much anticipated by her daughter, who has found comfort in animals through the course of her chronic illness.
Kathy said, While we were at a pediatric pain convention, Ellens ferret Noodles passed away. Ellens illness has meant that she has not been in school consistently for a number of years so animals have been a really important part of her life. Ellen has followed Mooses Instagram page for years and her relationship with Haley and Moose has provided a distraction from her illness. It will be wonderful for Ellen and Moose to meet in person next year. The calendar is so much fun and it portrays ferrets in such an appealing way. We love the calendar and Haleys wonderful photos.
Haley and Channing are setting out on a new photo challenge in 2019 and are currently planning their ferret-themed wedding snaps.
Haley said, Maybe Moose will be a ring bearer or I could carry a ferret instead of a bouquet.

Frances yellow vest protests lose momentum
FRANCE: Groups of defiant yellow vest demonstrators faced off with tens of thousands of police around France on Saturday, but the protest movement appeared to have lost momentum on a fifth and decisive weekend.
President Emmanuel Macron, facing the biggest crisis of his presidency, announced a series of concessions on Monday to defuse the explosive yellow vest crisis, which swelled up from rural and small-town France last month.
The package of tax and minimum wage measures for low-income workers, coupled with bitter winter weather this weekend, appeared to have helped bring calm to the country after more than a month of clashes and disruption.
France was also hit by a fresh deadly terror attack on Tuesday night when a gunman opened fire at a Christmas market in Strasbourg, leaving four dead and leading the government to urge people to stay at home to spare the stretched security forces.
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said Saturday that eight people had now died in incidents linked to the demonstrations, and called on protesters to halt their blockades across the country.
Everyones safety has to become the rule again, he said in a tweet.
Dialogue now needs to unite all those who want to transform France. Richard Ferrand, the head of the National Assembly, welcomed the necessary weakening of the rallies, adding that there had been a massive response to their demands.
An estimated 66,000 people took to the streets across France, according to figures from the interior ministry early Saturday evening, half the level of a week ago.
But Macrons approval rating has also fallen: dropping to 23 percent according to a poll published by Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper on Sunday, down two points from November. It marks a sharp decline from his 62 percent rating following his election in May last year. In Paris, the more than 8,000 police on duty easily outnumbered the 2,200 protesters counted by local authorities in the early afternoon.
There were 168 arrests by early evening, far down on the roughly 1,000 of last Saturday. Tear gas was occasionally fired, but a fraction of the amount was used compared with the weekends of December 8 or December 1 when graffiti was daubed on the Arc de Triomphe in scenes that shocked France.
Minor clashes were reported in southwestern Bordeaux where teargas was used and projectiles thrown. It was a similar picture in Toulouse, Nantes, Besancon, Nancy, Saint-Etienne and Lyon.
Protesters snarled traffic on motorways in the south of the country and on the A16 near the port of Calais in the north.
Until this week, a clear majority of French people had backed the protests, which sprung up initially over high taxes before snowballing into a wider opposition to Macrons pro-business agenda and style of governing.
But two polls published on Tuesday -- in the wake of Macrons concessions -- suggested the country was now broadly 50-50 on whether the protests should continue.
In a bid to end the standoff, a visibly contrite Macron announced a package of measures on Monday in a televised address, estimated by economists to cost up to 15 billion euros ($17 billion). More than 1,400 people have been injured since the protests began on November 17.
Around 69,000 security forces were mobilised across France, down from 89,000 last Saturday when 2,000 people were detained. - AFP

Projects of this nature have a significant impact on the economy as a whole, creating business and employment opportunities beyond the enterprises directly involved in it.

WEEKLY TEA AUCTION ENDING NOV. 28
HIGH, LOW GROWN SALE AVERAGES MOVE  IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
For the past eight weeks the Western High and Orthodox Low Grown averages have been moving in opposite directions.
Lanka Commodity Brokers Ltd Director Jehan Algama told Daily News Business yesterday that the Orthodox Low Growns saw a steady decline in averages from the month of February onwards.
The average of Rs. 663.43 recorded in January fell to Rs. 645.98 in February and eased substantially up to Rs. 540.02 in August.
There was a slight improvement in August but the sales spanning the months of September and October saw a reversal of fortunes with the auction average of Orthodox Low Growns moving up to Rs. 604.49 in October.
There has been more consolidation of prices during the past eight weeks with the average moving up further as can be seen from the following graph.
High Grown teas on the other hand have started coming down week by week during the last several auctions amidst plainer quality of offerings and less interest from the Tea Bag sector operating for Russia.
Past experience would show us that Russia purchases their winter requirements much in advance due to logistical constrains that prevail during their freezing winter season, and, only limited purchases are made during the latter part of November and throughout December, although renewed interest will be seen from mid January, 2019 onwards.
Meanwhile, Asia Siyaka Commodity Brokers PLC Director/ Senior Vice President Sohan Samaranayake told Daily News Business, This weeks sale quantity of 6.4 M kgs comprised of 3.1 M kgs of Low Grown and 0.9 M kgs of High Growns sold in the Ex-Estate catalogue.
There was sustained good demand for leafy Low Growns which ruled firm to dearer following been demand from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Syria and the U.A.E. Libya and Iraq operated for below best and secondary teas.
Turkey was active for Pekoe grades. Tippy teas however were only firm to sometimes easier as buying for Iran was subdued.
Another week of lack lustre demand was seen for Ex-Estate teas. Only a handful of Western High Growns with maintained quality were able to sell around previous levels whilst all others eased Rs.10-30/-.
The quality by and large of offerings reflected a drop in standard of leaf appearance and liquors.
A limited range of the better made CTC PF1s were about firm whilst the reminder was much lower.
Demand from traditional Western markets was subdued ahead of the upcoming festive season.
There was fair demand for below best teas from Hong Kong and China. Interest from Russia was weak.
Low Growns met with general demand. BOP1s were fully firm on last weeks levels, whilst select best OP1s were discounted sharply; below best and secondaries held firm, poorer varieties lost out in value.
OPs sold at dearer rates. Select best OPAs were discounted; all others were firm. Well-made stylish Pekoes were firm on last, below best and others appreciated. Pekoe1s were firm to lower all-round. In the Tippy Small Leaf catalogues FBOP1s sold at lower rates, whilst select best FBOPs held firm.
Below best varieties declined in value, poorer varieties held firm. FBOPF1s sold at lower rates all-round. Select best FBOPFs lost out in value, whilst others held firm.
BOP / BOPFs lost out in value too. In the Premium Flowery catalogues long leaf and small leaf tippy teas discounted sharply and remained unsalable.
0.93 Mnkg of Ex-Estate teas met with fair demand at lower rates. Except for a few select Western BOP which maintained, the other BOPs and their BOPFs were lower upto Rs. 40.
Nuwara Eliya BOPs were difficult of sale but BOPFs were firm and at times a little dearer.
Well-made Udapussellawa BOPs maintained but the others and the BOPFs were lower Rs. 10 to Rs. 30. Clean Uva BOPs were firm, but the others and the BOPFs lost Rs. 10 to Rs. 30. Medium BOPs were about firm.
Others were Rs. 20 to Rs. 30 lower and the BOPFs were lower Rs. 10 to Rs. 15. CTC PF1s were a lower market by Rs. 20 to Rs. 30. Best BP1s maintained. Others were lower Rs. 20 to Rs. 30.

At home smear tests boost cervical cancer screening
Women in England could be sent DIY smear tests in an effort to increase the number of cervical cancer screenings taking place across the country, under new plans being considered by the Department of Health.
Professor Anne Mackie, director of screening at Public Health England said a consultation was currently being carried out to to look at the benefits of self-testing at home for women.
The announcement follows a recent study in the British Medical Journal which revealed that doing so could boost the number of people taking smear tests, therefore increasing the possibility of detecting potentially pre-cancerous and cancerous processes in the cervix.
DIY smear tests for human papillomavirus (HPV) - the name for a group of viruses that affect the skin and the moist membranes lining your body, including the cervix, anus, mouth and throat - 30 of which can affect the genital area, were also found to be as accurate as screenings conducted by healthcare professionals.
The team of researchers from Australia and the US also compared the way in which women responded to being mailed DIY tests and receiving a letter reminding them that their cervical cancer screening is due. They concluded that being offered tests that could be sent in the mail is a constructive method of encouraging women to get tested for cervical cancer.
Offering self sampling kits generally is more effective in reaching under screened women than sending invitations, the studys authors wrote. However, they found that when women had to personally ask for an at-home smear test to be sent to them, this didnt increase the number of responses.
The team used research from 56 different studies to draw their conclusions. Last week, Jos Cervical Cancer Trust reported that the number of women attending their regular cervical cancer screenings had fallen to a 21-year low in England, with with just 71.4 per cent of women taken the test down from 72 per cent in 2017 and 73.7 per cent in 2011. The charity also found that one in four women avoided being tested for cervical cancer at medical clinics due to embarrassment.
Chief executive Robert Music said he believed the research demonstrated the benefits of women being offered at-home smear tests in the UK.
Its very positive to see further research showing the benefits of HPV self-sampling and hopefully this can help it becoming closer to reality in the UK, he said. Self-sampling is a much more accessible test, making it easier for many groups. Our recent research found that 80 per cent of women would prefer to self-sample at home, and this number rose to 88 per cent of women who had delayed having a smear test.

Jesus shines as City regain top spot, Eriksen fires Spurs
LONDON, Saturday - Manchester City swept back to the top of the Premier League as Gabriel Jesus struck twice in the champions 3-1 win over Everton, while Christian Eriksen kept Tottenham in the title hunt in a last-gasp 1-0 victory against Burnley on Saturday.
Jesus hadnt scored a Premier League goal since August, but the Brazilian striker ended that drought to put Everton to the sword at the Etihad Stadium.
The 21-year-olds goals and a strike from Raheem Sterling put City two points ahead of second-placed Liverpool, but Jurgen Klopps team can regain top spot if they beat bitter rivals Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday.
City coach Pep Guardiola, whose team had surrendered pole position with their loss at Chelsea last weekend, was pleased to see Jesus get back on track. It is so important for him, strikers need to score goals, said Guardiola.
What he has done today, he has done in other games but the difference is he has scored goals.
He has done it in a fantastic way. It was so valuable, his performance. Jesus opened the scoring in the 22nd minute with a cool finish from a tight angle after Leroy Sanes pass opened up the Everton defence.
Guardiolas side had to wait just five minutes after the break to make it 2-0, when patient build-up found Sane on the left and the Germans cross was met by a bullet header from Jesus.
Everton got back into the game in the 65th minute when Dominic Calvert-Lewins header from a high-hanging Digne cross flicking off Fabian Delph and past the helpless Ederson.
But Sterling came off the bench to end the contest four minutes later when the City winger met Fernandinhos cross with a firm header.
City were also cheered by the return of playmaker Kevin De Bruyne as a 75th minute substitute after a six-week lay-off with his second knee injury of the season.
LATE SHOW FOR SPURS
At Wembley, Tottenham left it until stoppage-time before finally breaking Burnleys stubborn resistance as the north London club moved within five points of the leaders. Mauricio Pochettinos third-placed side featured a first league start for 18-year-old midfielder Oliver Skipp, with Eriksen and Son Heung-Min on the bench.
Joe Hart kept fourth-from-bottom Burnley level when the former England keeper plunged low to his right to save Erik Lamelas low shot.
But Denmark playmaker Eriksen came on in the second half and he provided the match-winning moment with a clipped finish after Fernando Llorente and Harry Kane battered down the Burnley barricades in the 90th minute. Eriksens winner capped a fine few days for Tottenham, who qualified for the Champions League last 16 in midweek after drawing 1-1 at Barcelona.
It is a very good week for us, a fantastic win for us today, it is so important to be focused and try to keep our energy, Pochettino said. After the Barcelona game it is difficult to find the way to perform like this.
Wolves are up to seventh as Raul Jimenez and Ivan Cavaleiro wrapped up a 2-0 win at Molineux that condemned Bournemouth to a sixth defeat in their last seven games.
West Hams fourth straight win moved Manuel Pellegrinis side into ninth and inflicted more pain on bottom club Fulham as Robert Snodgrass and Michail Antonio struck in the opening half hour for a 2-0 victory at Craven Cottage.
Watford are just behind the Hammers on goal difference thanks to a stylish 3-2 win over Cardiff at Vicarage Road.
Javi Gracias team were cruising thanks to three wonder goals from Gerard Deulofeu, Jose Holebas and teenager Domingos Quina with his first Premier League goal.
But Cardiff set up a tense finish through Junior Hoilett in the 80th minute before Bobby Reids strike two minutes later. Luka Milivojevic lifted Crystal Palace five points away from the bottom three as the Serbia midfielders superb strike clinched a 1-0 victory against Leicester for the Eagles first Premier League victory without suspended talisman Wilfried Zaha since September 2016.
Newcastle also eased their relegation worries as Salomon Rondons 55th minute goal earned a 1-0 victory at Huddersfield, who remain in the bottom three.

JMC completes 46 years of operation
JMC College International a well-known education provider had completed 46 successful years of operation.
JMC was established in 1972 by Deshakeerthi Senior Chartered Accountant, J.M.U.B. Jayasekera, with three students who were engaged in professional education in Colombo. Due to his unblemished track record LMC grew to be one of the biggest private sector education institutions with over 12,000 active students island-wide.
Sandeepa Jayasekera, CEO
Among those 12,000 students nearly 5,000 students are learning at the JMC College International Network where they offer the local syllabus in English medium at an unbelievably reasonable cost.
In 1998, JMC expanded with International Schools and today, JMC boasts of 21 branches located at Colombo 09, Maharagama, Havelock Town, Kiribathgoda, Gampaha, Negombo, Angoda, Kaduwela, Kegalle, Kurunegala, Rathnapura, Kalutara, Bandarawela, Polonnaruwa, Kandy, Nittambuwa, Ampitiya, Peradeniya, Gampola and Kothmale, the founders home town.
Today the specialty behind JMC is that it is also recognized as the market leader in offering professional education such as AAT, Chartered Accountancy, CMA, Banking, Government Accountancy, Information Technology and Business English.
JMC was also instrumental for having instigated the Saturday English Medium School concept which provides English medium education for students from any schools in the country, said its Chief Executive Officer, Sandeepa Jayasekera.
JMC have proved their approach to education by producing competent, skillful intellectuals and professionals who values the proud Sri Lankan culture and updated with the latest developments in technology.
Education is a universal right and every child is entitled to receive the best education made available to them. However, many schools around the country tend to steer away from ensuring that a child receives a learning experience that is beyond that of simply graduating with a paper credential.
JMCs whole objective is to provide quality education to children at an affordable cost. When a student enroll JMC as a kindergarten student the academic education will be provided up to advanced level through JMC College International.
Additional academic education needs will be satisfied through the JMC Saturday School and a Tuition Segment, Information Technology education will be covered through JMC School of Computing, Professional education will be covered though JMC Professional Education Faculty, language education will be covered though JMC Language Faculty and Degree path will be covered though JMC Graduate School, he said.
JMC ensures quality is maintained focusing on a child-centered education, where each and every student receives individual attention. This means that beginning from the moment a child enrolls at JMC, the entire context of learning and development is built, allowing them to face the real world and not simply limit their knowledge to the pages of a book.
JMC has provided all the necessary infrastructure to students in order to facilitate a better-quality education. Further, extra-curricular activities from Sports meet, Art and Craft Exhibition, Annual concert, Fun fair, Wesak, Ramazan, Nawa Rathri and Christmas celebrations to competitions such as oratory, debating, dancing, singing, and IT literacy are being organized to identify and develop different skills of JMC students.
Thus, the final JMC products are both academically sound, skillful and filled with positive attitudes. JMC has produced 9 As in O/L and 3 As in A/ L showing their excellence in academic studies. JMC past year 2018 was a remarkable year for JMC. Twenty years back when JMC started the International School in Colombo 09 branch, there was a small 6 year old student, Tharindu Perera in the first batch. The student made the history by becoming a Chartered accountant in year 2018 by studying only at JMC.
JMC, has also embraced the need to offer extra classes covering core subjects and taking the concept to a whole new level, where each school operates as yet another separate schooling entity that takes place every Saturday and accommodates a different set of teachers, a Principal and students who come from various other schools.
Technology being an essential element in current context, children must be given a proper guidance from inception. Thus, JMC School of computing has provided a separate Kids IT Academy platform to all students realizing the requirement.
Technology being a trendy feature, JMC has already taken major steps to establish a web-based student management system (www.jmc.lk) to have a better coordination. Through this web site portal JMC has initiated an online registration platform which allows parents to enroll their child without visiting the school.

Dialog inter-club A division rugby league
Kandy SC ends Havelock SCs unbeaten run
Kandy Sports Club produced a superb performance to outwit Havelock Sports Club and win their sixth Dialog sponsored inter-club first round rugby match with a 31-21 win at Nittawela yesterday.
Kandy SC was in full form scoring their 31 points off 4 goals and a penalty kick at goal against the 21 that came off 3 goals.
Kandy SC controlled the tackle area, denying Havelocks quick possession and fracturing the supply line. They went into the interval with a 21-7 lead. They duly won the first half with the opponents not prepared to roll over.
Havelock SC was left shocked by Kandy SCs superb ball handling. Havelocks forwards were in the game with some good moves, but Kandy knew how to handle them. Kandy SC players from number one to fifteen showcased in contrasting styles, and a big hand should be given to their no. 8 Buwanika Udangamuwa for three super touch downs.
It was Havelock SCs first defeat in six games. Havelocks looked to move the ball out of the tackle as often as possible, while Kandy looked for their big men to carry into contact. However, it was the winning teams intent, physicality and ambition - matched by an accuracy that won the day.
Havelocks showed plenty of character as they fought their way into the game, but ultimately they ran out of time and ideas. They started the game at great pace as they looked to get the ball wide at every opportunity and got around Kandys defence on several occasions.
In this all important game Kandy showed their character as they came out with intent and got the start they wanted. What a performance from the linkman Roshan Weeraratne who showed real grit of performance. He controlled the game brilliantly. They were excellent in attack but it was also their defence that impressed as they matched the Park club physically and did not take a step backwards.
All in all there were a good numbers of yellow cards on show.
For Kandy the tries came from Buwanika Udangamuwa (3), Anuruddha Wilawara (1) and the goal kicking came off the boot of Thilina Wijesinghe. For Havelocks the tries came from Sethum Peries, Dushmantha Priyadarshana and Dinuk Amarasinghe and the goal kicking was done by Reza Mubarak.

Latham ton as New Zealand cruise
WELLINGTON - Opener Tom Latham's unbeaten century put New Zealand in charge of the first Test against Sri Lanka in Wellington on Sunday, as the Black Caps raced past the tourists' first-innings total and looked to build an imposing lead.
Latham was 121 not out at stumps on day two with New Zealand cruising at 311 for two in reply to Sri Lanka's modest 282.
It was a frustrating day for Sri Lanka's bowlers on a Basin Reserve pitch that transformed into a batters' paradise after wreaking havoc during the tourists' innings on day one.
Black Caps skipper Kane Williamson narrowly missed out on his own century, falling for 91, and all New Zealand's batsmen made good starts, with Jeet Raval making 43 and Ross Taylor not out on 50.
While the Sri Lanka attack worked hard, they could not build pressure and the two New Zealand wickets that fell were the result of rash shots from Raval and Williamson. That was not an issue for Latham, who meticulously crafted his seventh Test century from 219 balls and never looked rattled at the crease.
He combined with Williamson for a 162-run partnership, laying the foundation for a huge total from a line-up that still has plenty of batting to come.
Despite failing to reach triple figures, Williamson still has a remarkable record against Sri Lanka, with three centuries against them in seven Tests. That includes an unbeaten 242 at Wellington's Basin Reserve in 2015.
Sri Lanka will be hoping for a dramatic New Zealand collapse on day three to salvage any hopes of a win.
Earlier, they added just seven to their overnight batting total before Tim Southee coaxed an inside edge off Kumara to claim a six-wicket innings haul.
Kumara's departure for a duck left Dickwella stranded on 80 not out after he led a rearguard action for Sri Lanka. Angelo Mathews and Dimuth Karunaratne were the only other batsmen to offer any meaningful resistance, notching 83 and 79 respectively and forging a 133-run partnership.
Sri Lanka, ranked sixth in the world, have lost their last five Tests against New Zealand and suffered a 3-0 home Test series whitewash against England last month.
They have faced upheaval in their coaching and selection ranks in recent weeks and arrived in New Zealand low on confidence.
In contrast, the fourth-ranked Black Caps entered the two-match contest buoyed by their first away Test series win over Pakistan in 49 years. AFP

Leeds take Championship top spot as Norwich falter
LONDON, Saturday - Leeds moved to the top of the Championship with a 1-0 win at Bolton, while previous leaders Norwich were held 2-2 by Bristol City on Saturday.
Patrick Bamford hit his first league goal for Marcelo Bielsas side five minutes after coming on as a second-half substitute.
Bamford, a 7 million recruit from Middlesbrough, had not featured for Leeds since August 31 due to a knee injury.
But the 25-year-old striker made up for lost time as he netted the 66th minute strike that gave Leeds a fifth successive league victory and a one-point lead over Norwich in the race for promotion to the Premier League.
It was hard win but a deserved one. Bamford can be very important. For him, it is very good for his confidence, Bielsa said.
He has worked very hard to gain his full fitness. Its important to have two good strikers in our team.
Norwich could have reclaimed pole position with a win at Ashton Gate in the days late game, but the Canaries ended up relieved to take a point.
Marco Stiepermann fired Daniel Farkes side ahead, but Famara Diedhiou and Callum ODowda responded either side of half-time.
With just 12 minutes left, Max Aarons 78th minute header rescued Norwich, who are five points clear of third placed West Bromwich Albion.
Jonathan Kodjias 84th minute header gave Aston Villa a 2-2 draw against Stoke at Villa Park.
Joe Allen broke the deadlock just two minutes into the second half, but Villa equalised in the 73rd minute through a penalty from on-loan Chelsea forward Tammy Abraham.
Stoke went back in front just five minutes later when Benik Afobe converted from the spot.
Swansea scored two goals in as many second half minutes to beat Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 at the Liberty Stadium.
Birmingham fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Blackburn, while Middlesbroughs play-off push was hit by a 2-1 defeat at QPR. Hull beat Brentford 2-0 to increase the pressure on Bees boss Thomas Frank, while Preston beat struggling Millwall 3-2 at Deepdale.
Managerless Reading moved out of the bottom three after a 1-1 draw at Rotherham.

Library of the future
What do you give the worlds most literate country for its 100th birthday For Finlands politicians and public, the answer was simple: a vast, state-of-the-art library, a new living room for the nation.
Twenty years in the planning, Helsinkis central library officially opened on December 5 at the end of a year of festivities marking the centenary of Finlands independence after breaking with Russia in 1917 following six centuries under Swedish rule.
It is a huge, flowing structure of wood and glass sitting on a prime spot in the city centre, directly opposite the Finnish parliament. But whereas the parliament building is an austere and imposing hunk of granite, the new library was designed by Finnish firm ALA Architects as a welcoming, undulating structure, clad in 160 kilometres worth (99 miles) of Finnish spruce, drawing people inside with a warm hug.
Named Oodi - ode in Finnish - it is intended as a paean to knowledge, learning and equality in what was ranked the worlds most literate country by a 2016 report based on official statistics.
While books are featured heavily - 100,000 of them - the cutting-edge facility also boasts studios for music and video production, a cinema, and workshops containing 3D printers and laser cutters, all free of charge for the public.
It will also house an EU-funded visitor centre, offering information on the 28-member blocs work and its impact on peoples daily lives.
Oodi gives a new modern idea of what it means to be a library, Tommi Laitio, Helsinkis executive director of culture and leisure, told AFP.
It is a house of literature but its also a house of technology, its a house of music, its a house of cinema, its a house of the European Union. And I think all of these come together to this idea of hope and progress, Laitio said.
One sign of such progress is the buildings fleet of book-carrying robots - small grey waggons which navigate themselves in and out of lifts, avoiding people and furniture, in order to bring returned books up from the basement and drop them off at the correct bookcase.
There, a human member of staff will place the books on the shelf. Oodis planners believe the robot librarians are the first instance in the world of self-driving technology being used in this way inside a public library.
The robots will become a familiar sight to the librarys expected 10,000 visitors a day.
Oodi will have areas walled off for quiet studying, but for everywhere else, there will not be a silence rule in force, as is common in libraries.
In fact, making a mess and noise are positively encouraged inside the nerd loft - a place to inspire people of all ages to come together and create. Users can build things in workshops equipped with cutting-edge tools, borrow musical instruments or play games consoles. AFP

Life-saving high chair
A poorly dog with a rare medical condition is on the road to recovery thanks to a specially-designed high chair which helps him to eat.
Buck, a 17-month-old Labrador, suffers from megaesophagus  which means he cannot eat food without being sick unless he is held in an upright position. University students and an animal charity teamed up to create a unique chair which holds him in place so he can eat.
Buck currently weighs just half of what he should at his age and once faced the prospect of starving to death and not living beyond his second birthday. But with the help of the highchair it is now hoped he can start piling on the pounds and live a healthy and fulfilling life.
Buck was taken in by the charity Team Edward Labrador Rescue before his story was spotted by University of Nottingham vet and teaching associate, Emma Drinkall.
Along with her partner Nick Rowan, a senior lecturer in product design and engineering at De Montford University, the couple designed and built the chair in just a day.
The high chair has been designed so that Emma and Nick can continue to adapt it as Buck hopefully gains weight and grows in the future.
Buck has not regurgitated since using the chair and his carers have put him on a high calorie puppy food diet to help him improve his strength.
Emma, from the University of Nottinghams School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, said: We saw the Bucks story on social media, and I knew we just had to do something if he was going to have a chance.
Luckily Nick and I have the combined expertise and experience to build the chair quickly. There is currently no surgery available for dogs with this condition, and as Buck is already receiving the medications that can help, the one thing other thing that could help him keep his food down is gravity itself. Being upright while feeding will help the food drip through the sphincter that controls access to his stomach. Dogs with megaoesophagus are at risk of developing very serious chest infections which can prove fatal, because they can accidentally breathe in food particles when they regurgitate their food. We hope that by feeding Buck this way and stopping him from regurgitating we will minimise the risk of this additional complication developing. Wendy, Team Edward Labrador Rescue, David Bucks foster Dad, and Laura Bucks Vet have all done an amazing job with Buck so far.Nick said, Im just so pleased with how it fits, how comfortably he sits in it and how happy he is to be fed like this. He is the same width in his shoulders as our own 5 kilo Jack Russell, so without meeting Buck ourselves, we had to double check his measurements during the build  it just didnt seem right for a big dog like a Labrador.
Vet Laura Pearce, from the Lawrence Veterinary Centre in Eastwood, Notts., has been Bucks vet since he was rescued by the charity.
She said, I am actually surprised that Buck has lived as long as he has with this condition. His oesophagus is abnormal in that its enlarged and has lost its tube-like state that pushes food through to the stomach. It means little of the food he eats actually makes it into his stomach for digestion, most gets stuck in pouches in the oesophagus or is regurgitated again.
Buck weighed only 17kg (37.4lbs) when he was taken in by the charity Team Edward.
Wendy Hopewell, who runs Team Edward, said, We were really shocked.
The previous owner said they were really struggling to feed him but when I saw him I thought wow, Ive never seen a labrador that thin before It was just the most fabulous sight to see Buck eating in the chair and happy to be in it. To see how he sat in it straight away and get stuck in was incredible, it just pulls at your heartstrings.

Manufacturing activities  slow down in Nov.
According to SL Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), manufacturing activities has slowed down in November.
The slowdown observed in manufacturing activities in November was mainly driven by the slowdown in new orders and production, especially in manufacturing of textiles, wearing apparels, leather and related activities.
However, new orders and production in the manufacturing of food and beverages activities has improved with the Christmas season demand.
Employment remains unchanged during the period due to the difficulties in recruiting additional employees, especially in manufacturing of furniture activities.
Meanwhile, overall stock of purchases indicated a slowdown, mainly due to the subdued production of manufacturing of textiles, wearing apparels, leather and related products.
Suppliers delivery time lengthened at a slower rate which is mainly driven by the reduction of lead time on demand, for supplies related to manufacturing of food and beverages activities to speed up their production.
All the sub-indices of PMI Manufacturing recorded values above the neutral 50 threshold signalling an overall expansion in November yet at a slower pace compared to October 2018.

Point of view
Sri Lankan equity market performance continued to remain mixed this week as investors awaited the outcome of the Supreme Courts judgment on the Presidents sudden dissolution of Parliament on November 9th.
The main-share ASPI lost ~43 points at the start of the week ahead of the court ruling, but gained ~36 points during the rest of the week as the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Gazette issued by the President dissolving Parliament was unconstitutional and that the Parliament cannot be dissolved until 4.5 out of its 5-year term is completed.
The weeks mixed performance resulted in the ASPI closing the week ~ 0.1% W-o-W ( or 7 points) lower, but staunchly above the key psychological mark of 6000-points (at 6062.55 points).
Activity levels on the market meanwhile remained in line with that of last week, with average daily turnover at Rs.0.6Bn(relative to 0.6Bn last week), but 22% lower than the YTD average of Rs.0.8Bn.
Local institutions and HNIs accounted for ~38% of total market activity this week (cf. ~42% so far this year), with buying interests focused mainly on Odel (~38% of total crossings), Commercial Bank (~29% of total crossings) and HNB (~11% of total crossings).
Foreign investors meanwhile, continued to sell-off Sri Lankan equities with net selling for the week amounting to Rs.963Mn (cf. Rs.929Mn last week). Although foreign individual investors have recorded a net purchase of Rs.5.4Bn between Jan-Nov18, foreign institutional investors have off-loaded Sri Lankan equities to the tune of Rs.24.0Bn to bring the total net foreign outflow from domestic equities to Rs.18.5Bn (by Nov18).
Foreign investors sold a further Rs.1.9Bn in the first two weeks of December, dragging the Colombo bourses YTD net foreign selling position to ~Rs.20.4Bn relative to net foreign purchases of 17.7Bn last year.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to remain influenced by domestic political developments especially the Presidents decision on the new cabinet and prime minister.
Robust domestic demand to aid developing Asia
The ADB this week noted that its outlook for global growth has firmed (since its last update in Sep18 amid the escalating US-China trade conflict) due to the 90-day truce between the two countries as they engage in bilateral negotiations.
The Group added that although this downside risk remains (given the significant policy differences to be reconciled between China and USA), developing Asia continues to weather the external headwinds due to robust domestic demand (6.0% in 2018 and 5.8% in 2019)1.
South Asia meanwhile still remains the fastest-growing sub-region in developing Asia, with growth on track to meet its estimate of 7% in 2018 and reach 7.1% in 2019 especially as India maintains its growth momentum on rebounding exports and higher industrial and agricultural output.
ADB noted however that i) tighter credit as the nonbank finance sector experiences stress, ii) limited fiscal space for public capital expenditure, and, iii) escalating trade tensions1 remain downside risks in India although some of these risks could be offset by the recent decline in oil prices and greater export competitiveness as the Indian rupee has weakened 10% since early 2018.
The Group also noted that although GDP growth in Sri Lanka grew by 3.7% in Q218 (amid revived private consumption), continued tightening of government current spending, stagnant fixed investment and the recent political uncertainty are likely to dampen Sri Lankas short-term growth prospects.
The growth projections for major industrial economies (US, Euro Area and Japan) meanwhile were retained as despite contraction in Japan in Q3, favorable outcomes in the US and the euro area confirm that the major industrial economies are on track to meet growth projections of 2.3% in 2018 and 2.1% in 2019.

New Cabinet within two days - Eran
A new Cabinet will be sworn in within 48 hours in order to ensure that all necessary financial allocations be properly done for the next year, UNP MP Eran Wickremeratne yesterday said.
Wickremeratne also said that the new Cabinet will only consist of 30 ministerial portfolios that should only be held by the United National Front.
He also said that no MPs who joined hands with the political coup be given ministerial portfolios. Wickremeratne also pointed out the MPs whose allegiances were in question not be given portfolios either.
MP Wickremeratne was making these observations yesterday afternoon at a press brief held at Temple Trees following Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in as the Prime Minister.
We cannot allow those people who went off the track for money or positions. Our people expect a new political culture from us. Yes, anyone who is interested can join or support our government, but not for any favourations or benefits. If we take people who supported this political coup back into our Cabinet, it will be a major setback. This is not a time for compromises, Wickremeratne said.
MP Wickremeratne also observed that the ministers who will be given Cabinet portfolios should use the available facilities without looking for new luxuries. They should work with whatever the resources and facilities already available. There needs not be any new vehicles or other such facilities. We surely need to cut down all these foreign tours to a minimum. That is what our UNP supporters are waiting for and that is what all the people in this country are expecting from us, he also said.
Further speaking, Wickremeratne said that in the coming year, the UNF needs to follow a people-friendly, welfare oriented governance and a patriotic policy as sought out by the majority of the people in the country. Our journey in the coming year should take place under one vision with a specific direction, Wickremeratne further said. We cannot entertain many visions and take many directions, he added. He also observed that for the last three years, Yahapalana government was not able to do much for the low income families. Some of those who were in the previous Cabinet blocked the government from giving reliefs for poor people. If we form a UNF government with a UNF members-only Cabinet we will be able to make a difference for our people, he added.

The Next Merkel Not Quite!
The election on December 7 of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to lead Germanys Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has been hailed as a victory for the outgoing party chair, Chancellor Angela Merkel. She was Merkels preferred successor as leader of Germanys center-right party and is now the presumptive favourite to become the first head of government in the post-Merkel era, which will begin, at the latest, at Germanys next scheduled national election in 2021.
German commentators seem certain that Kramp-Karrenbauers leadership will represent both a continuation of Merkels moderate style of conservatismwhich kept the CDU in power in national politics for over a dozen years by steadily draining the center-left of supportand an improvement over her mentors deficits.
Its not hard to understand why Germans would assume Kramp-Karrenbauer, widely referred to in Germany simply as AKK, is a sort of mini-Merkel. Like the current chancellor, shes a personable and unassuming middle-aged woman, someone who prefers to publicly seek consensus rather than use polarizing ideological rhetoricunlike her male rivals for the leadership position, who were more pronounced conservatives. So why not expect marginal changes to Merkels political strategy, with accordingly marginal improvements to the (largely successful) political outcomes
This analysis misunderstands, however, the political situation that Kramp-Karrenbauer is being asked to confront at homeand, more important, it misunderstands the political identity she will be bringing to the task. She may seem like Merkel in style, but she differs in substance. And that will make all the difference.
Social Democratic Party (SPD)
The thought is that Kramp-Karrenbauer will asymmetrically demobilize the center-leftthat is, she will persuade its voters to either defect for the CDU or stay at home on election dayby cribbing from its policy, just as Merkel did while driving the Social Democratic Party (SPD) to its current lowly 15 percent standing in national polls. Meanwhile, the new leaders identity as a Roman Catholic mother of three from deep in former West Germanywhich is more in keeping with the partys traditional profile than Merkels East German biographyis thought to be capable of healing divisions in the CDU that had opened up under Merkel and perhaps even reversing defections to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has expanded from 12.6 percent of the vote in 2017 to as high as 18 percent support in some recent polls.
Its true that surveys show Kramp-Karrenbauers vague policy agenda is highly popular with Social Democrats and Greens (the latter who have benefited in recent years from the SPDs Merkel-fueled collapse). Greens polled by the weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel viewed her even more positively (65 percent) than do CDU members (62 percent). If the CDU elects a woman, and twice in a row, a Berlin Green Party member told FP, it shows that all of the other parties can too, but theyre not doing it. It shows them up. With such star quality, Kramp-Karrenbauer might even prove able to demobilize the Greens in the same way Merkel did the SPD.
At the same time, many conservatives are hoping she can leverage her Catholic faith to win back far-right voters. Throughout her career, Kramp-Karrenbauer has been an avowed, if mild-mannered, social conservative: Shes on the record against same-sex marriage, and she firmly opposes any loosening of Germanys relatively restrictive abortion laws; her rhetoric on migration policywhich has included the suggestion of sending refugees back to Syriahas occasionally fallen on the CDUs far-right wing. Indeed, theres little reason to believe that she would have initiated any of the openly liberal social policies that Merkel undertook in recent years, such as ending mandatory military conscription and initiating conciliatory dialogue between the government and Germanys Muslim community.
This, however, is the hitch in the logic of Kramp-Karrenbauer as saviour of the party and leader of a more harmonious, united nation. The same surveys that show her fawned over by the left also show her rejected categorically by AfD voters and even seen as somewhat suspect by many traditional conservatives. In fact, only 4 percent of AfD backers in the Spiegel poll see her favourably. (SPD support for her is 10 times greater.) Just 2 percent of the AfD supporters surveyed said they believed that Kramp-Karrenbauer could lure back stray former CDU conservatives now voting AfD. Another poll yielded a similar result: AfD supporters were the least convinced of all the parties that she would unite the CDU.
Given Kramp-Karrenbauers genuine conservative credentials, why do her charms fall so flat on AfD fans The most likely answer is among the most ignored: misogyny. The AfD is the most male of all Germanys parliamentary parties. In 2017, nearly twice as many AfD voters were men than women, and in eastern Germany the party is even more strongly male than in the west.
Migration policies
A political commentator for the conservative daily Die Welt, Susanne Gaschke, summed up the problem concisely: From the beginning, there was hatred in certain circles for Angela Merkel, which had nothing at all to do with her policies.  The Merkel hatred of the past three years, in my opinion, has at least as much to do with frustrated masculinity as with concrete and legitimate questions about migration. Just maybe, hopes Gaschke, Kramp-Karrenbauer will catch less of it than Merkel: Perhaps it is enough that Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer has three children and neither Merkel nor East German. Alas, nothing points in that direction nowon the contrary.
Kramp-Karrenbauer obviously understands the softness of her support on the right and thus is already making moves to make herself more appealing to the AfD. She has signaled that shell begin by talking with opponents of the governments migration policies.
Her new deputy, Paul Ziemiak, comes from the partys right wing. She will initially be focused on uniting the CDU after earning a narrow victory over more stridently conservative rivals for the job. The fact that the election was so close also means that there is a need for a clear conservative policy in the CDU, opines the daily Berliner Zeitung. Kramp-Karrenbauer wont be able to get away with making occasional rhetorical feints to the right; she will have no choice but to endorse clearly conservative priorities and perhaps even reversals of some of Merkels policies.

ORCAM MY EYE  introduced to Sri Lanka
For the first time, a wireless smart camera device attached to the side of spectacle frames reads text, identify objects and conveys them to a blind person via voice, has been introduced to Sri Lanka.
The device reads texts, supermarket barcodes and recognizes faces while speaking the information into the users ear.
The OrCam unit, which weighs less than an ounce, is a front-facing camera with a small speaker positioned toward the wearers ear, and communicates visual information in real-time without any need for network connectivity.
This device, ORCAM MY EYE is manufactured by Orange IT, a Sri Lankan company and has successfully tested on the blind in associated with one of the leading ocular care companies in Sri Lanka, J. M. Wickramarachchi and Co. under their mission, Vision of the Future program.
Dubbed a hearing aid for the eyes, artificial intelligence OrCam helps blind people read and recognise loved ones with amazing new technology, said CEO, Wickramarachchi Opticians and Founder Chairman, WISH Foundation (Wickramarachchi Institute of Sight and Hearing), Mihira Wickramarachchi.
This lightweight smart camera in the unit instantly reads text aloud, from any surface and recognizes faces, products, and credit cards, money notes in real time. It even could read restaurant menus, signs, product labels, computer and smartphone screens including SMS.
I think its a great advancement for Sri Lanka as its the first country in the region to offer this ground breaking technology that can offer to patients with visual impairments. The product is now commercially available in Sri Lanka at Wickramarachchi Opticians.
Once a person wears the spectacle with the ORCAM MY EYE camera it should be pointed to any object and then it reads the objects and speaks with built-in HD mini speaker to the person who wears it.
Cam also snaps onto any eyeglass frame magnetically and also has Instant WiFi software updates.
Over the four decades in service, Wickramarachchi also said that he has introduced VisionX machine to his optical diagnostic division, which is the only one of its kind in Sri Lanka. Now all refractive quantitative analysis can be done at the tip of fingers in a matter of seconds. In addition to being equipped with an air puff tonometer to measure intra ocular pressure, it is also a fully-fledged refractokerato meter in addition to being a complete corneal diagnostic, he said.

## Title: In praise of the long and complicated sentence

In praise of the long and complicated sentence
The style guides say: keep your sentences short. Write cleanly, cut as many words as you can, and dont overburden your readers short-term memory by delaying the arrival of the full stop. But sometimes a sentence just needs to be long. The world resists our efforts to enclose it between a capital and a full stop. The sentence has to withhold its end because life is like that, refusing to fold itself neatly into subject, verb and object.
A long sentence should exult in its own expansiveness, lovingly extending its line of thought while being always clearly moving to its close. It should create anticipation, not confusion, as it goes along. The hard part is telling the difference between the two. I once heard Ken Dodd say that the secret of a great comedian is that he makes the audience feel simultaneously safe and slightly on edge. He has about half a minute from coming on stage, Dodd reckoned, to establish that he is harmless. He must quickly convey calm and control, so that the audience members relax into their seats, safe in the knowledge that nothing truly awkward is about to happen. But he must also create a sense of unpredictability that makes them lean forward. A good long sentence has that same tension. It should frustrate readers just a little, and put them just faintly on edge, without ever suggesting that it has lost control of what is being said.
Vaguely dissatisfied
A sentence, once begun, demands its own completion. It throws a thought into the air and leaves the reader vaguely dissatisfied until that thought has come in to land. We read a sentence with the same part of our brains that processes music. Like music, a sentence arrays its elements into an order that should seem fresh and surprising and yet shaped and controlled. It works by violating expectations and creating mild frustrations on the way to fulfillment. As it runs its course, it assuages some of the frustration and may create more. But by the end, things should have resolved themselves in a way that allows something, at least, to be said.
A long sentence can seem thrillingly out of breath, deliciously tantalizing, so long as we feel the writer is still in charge. It is like listening to a great singer as he holds his breath and prolongs a phrase. The secret to Frank Sinatras singing is his gift for fluid phrasing. Matt Monro may have had better technique, Tony Bennett more lung power, Nat King Cole a smoother tone, Bobby Darin more swing. But Sinatra beat them all at breathing.
As a young singer, Sinatra listened awestruck to his bandleader Tommy Dorseys astoundingly smooth trombone playing. The note holds seemed to defy human lung capacity. Dorsey would play a musical phrase right through, seemingly without taking a breath, for eight or even sixteen bars. Sinatra sat behind him on the bandstand to learn when and how he breathed, but could not even see his jacket move up and down. Eventually he worked out that Dorsey had a pinhole in the corner of his mouth through which he was taking furtive breaths. Sinatra came to see that singing, too, was about breath control and that the secret was never to break the phrase. In music, legato means bound together: a seamless flow, with no break between the notes. Sinatra wanted to sing legato, running the whole phrase into one smooth breath.
Running tracks
Sometimes a sentence just needs to be long. The world resists our efforts to enclose it between a capital and a full stop. The sentence has to withhold its end because life is like that, refusing to fold itself neatly into subject, verb and object.
He worked out on running tracks and practiced holding his breath underwater in public pools, thinking song lyrics to himself as he swam. His breath control got better and, where he had to breathe in a song, he got better at hiding it. He moved the microphone towards and away from his mouth as he sang so that you never heard him inhale. If he had to sneak in a little breath somewhere he made sure it seemed deliberate, as if he were letting the message sink in. He learned this trick from watching the horn section in Dorseys band during long instrumentals. When he sang, it sounded as if he was making it all up as he went along, pausing to pluck a word out of the air, lagging a fraction behind the beatlike a long, lithe sentence, ad libitum but always in control of what it was saying.
Unlike writing, which runs with its own irregular pulse, music has a regular rhythm with a steady downbeat. Musical meter controls time completely: a half note hangs in the air for exactly half as long as the whole note. This allows harmonizing singers and instruments to pursue separate agendas and yet still pleasurably coincide. But music also depends on phrasing, which is more subtle and varied than meter. A musical phrase lasts for about as long as a person can sing, or blow a wind instrument, in a single breath. What phrasing does to music is more like what a sentence does to words. A skilled singer can make the phrasing, the sentence structure of a song, work with or against the meter. - Lit Hub

Protection of Constitution guarantees democracy - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe delivering a special statement said the fundamental law of the country is the Constitution.
It is now well over 87 years after we received the right to vote or franchise. Our people protected the Constitution for 87 years.We protected Fundamental Rights and whenever there was a threat,the people came forward to protect the Constitution and their own rights, the Prime Minister said.
That was what happened at the 2015 Presidential election. You all joined hands to end an era where the Constitution and human rights were crushed. We passed the 19th Amendment to the Constitution with the aim of protecting and strengthening the rights of the people. I wish to emphasize here that by acting contrary to the Constitution, democracy will not be protected, he said.
The Prime Minister of the country should have the highest confidence in Parliament.The Prime Minister cannot take forward the country without the support of the majority. At the same time when a No Confidence Motion is passed in Parliament against the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers should resign and vacate the post they held. According to the Constitution, when a new Parliament is appointed, until the completion of four and half years, no one has the power to dissolve that Parliament. That could only be done by passing a motion with a two thirds majority, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The wrong action committed violating the provisions of the Constitution cannot be rectified under the cloak of a General Election. The Supreme Court decision has stated that no room should be given to conduct an illlegal General Election.
I wish to translate and read the passage found on page 85 of the Supreme Court ruling.
It has been said by some of the added Respondents, that by refusing the petitioners, applications will enable a General Election in pursuance of the Proclamation marked P1 and, therefore, justified because it will give effect to the franchise of the people. That submission is not correct. Giving effect to the franchise of the people is not achieved by Court permitting a General Election held consequent to the dissolution of Parliament which has been effeted contrary to the provisions of the Constitution. Such a General Election will be unlawful and its results will be opened to question. A General Election is valid only if it is lawfully held. Thus, a General Election held consequent to the dissolution of Parliament which has been done contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, will not be a true exercise of the franchise of the people.
That was what I said on October 26 at Temple Trees. I said on that day our fight was for the sake of democracy; justice; to protect the Constitution; adherence of the rule of Law and civilized and moral conduct of society. And I also said that at the end, we would win the fight. I say the same thing even today and I will say the same tomorrow too. I will abide by my word. I will do what I say and I only say what I can do, the Prime Minister said.
Most of the people in this country joined together to protect the Constitution, democracy and the rights of the people. Hundreds of thousands of people who adhere to their conscience came to the forefront of this fight as Sri Lankans, disregarding their race, religion and party politics. Sri Lankans living abroad too supported this move to the best of their ability. They joined this on behalf of their country and democracy without any personal gain, he added.
I take this opportunity to salute them all, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Similarly, I would like to pay my homage to the Maha Sangha and the clergy of other religions who guided us in this endeavour. The Honourable Speaker, Ministers and Members of Parliament fully dedicated to uphold the supremacy of the Parliament and democracy. I offer my sincere gratitude to all of them. Our judicial institutions, including the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, exhibited their independence and the identity to the whole world. I would like to extend my gratitude to the Judiciary as well as to the lawyers who made their legal submissions. And also, I offer my gratitude to members of the Public Service, Armed Forces and the Police who upheld the rule of law and justice.
My gratitude should go to the journalists who fought for the impartiality of the Media in the midst of the pressures of errant journalists and to all who toiled day and night voluntarily to tell the truth to the world through social media.
In January 2015 and August 2015, we gained the mandate of the people to bring good governance, to preserve democracy and the Rule of Law to eliminate frauds and corruption, to empower Parliament after abolishing the Executive Presidency and to uphold the sovereignty of the people. During the past three and half years we have done a lot to the Country.
It is due to progressive steps including the establishment of the Independent Commissions that many institutions including the Judiciary could act independently.
The whole country is enjoying the harvest of the seeds we sowed during the past three and half years. We are happy about that. However, there are things that we could not implement in this period. Some work got delayed. We could not finalize some work. But, we havent lost our dedication and determination. We are determined to rectify our shortcomings. We will take steps to expedite the litigation regarding fraud and corruption. We have created an environment in which different ethnic groups can live together in harmony and co existence. We will dedicate ourselves to maintain harmony among different ethnic groups.
Now, we should go forward. Even by now, we have initiated discussions with a number of political parties in respect to abolishing the Executive Presidency. And also, we will have discussions with the Tamil National Alliance and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna to bring about a political solution in which all citizens can live in harmony in a unitary state.
I didnt take any steps to enter into any agreement with the LTTE in order to win the Presidential Election. In the past, I dedicated the victory at the Presidential Election for the sake of my motherland. I havent yet changed that stand.
Our intention is to form a broad alliance to protect democracy. It is only through the democratic environment in which the voice of the people is considered and the rights of the people are protected. We can bring about a dignified society where the future generation can do without fear.
Our efforts to create a strong democratic environment that any external force cannot suppress.My heart-felt wishes is to create such a Sri Lanka. You all wish for such a country. It is the hope of all Sri Lankans. Therefore, I appeal to all of you to forget all differences and join hands with this broad alliance for the sake of our Motherland, democracy,rights of the people and to create a free country for future generations.
Let us allow our heart-felt wish.
Thank you all

Reading While Nursing
This year I read mostly while nursing. My daughter was born in January, and those short winter days gave way to long nights spent with her sleeping against my chesta tiny burrito in zip-up pajamas, her rhythmic breath against my neckor waking up to eat, nearly falling asleep in that primal bliss, with the radiator hissing and clanking behind us, my finger stroking her cheek to wake her up again. I read so much about motherhood. Or maybe it was that everything I read seemed to be about motherhood. Grad school had taught me new ways to read, through various theoretical lenses, and so did my daughter. She taught me how to read with one arm, in stolen chunks of time, in half-delirium, in the long hormonal soup of the fourth trimester.
I read Meaghan OConnells And Now We Have Everything, a collection of gloriously unsettled essays about imagining giving birth and then actually giving birth and then circling the tiny creature, lying in his Pack n Play, at first desperate for him to sleep and then desperately afraid he has died. I read the brilliant and unforgettable stories in Octavia Butlers Bloodchild and Other Stories, including the one about a man carrying an alien baby, which is also about what it means to feel both violated by the life you made possible and beholden to it. I reread Meghan ORourkes Sun in Days, whose poems wonder atamong other thingsthe shift from conjuring an imagined child to caring for an actual one, a baby built not from longing but from grapefruit and Rice Chex: you were already you, not / an outgrowth of my mind.
Swollen with hormones
One evening I strapped my baby to my chest with the impossibly complicated stretchy fabric wrap and walked to a bookstore to listen to Terese Marie Mailhot read from her eloquent and seething memoir, Heart Berries. Swollen with hormones, I nearly started crying as she read about remembering her sons milky breath years after losing custody; then my daughter started crying, not because she imagined another woman remembering milk but because she wanted milk herself. It felt good to nurse her, but it didnt solve the pain in Mailhots precise, exquisite book, nor was it meant to.
It seemed impossible to read about loving children without reading about loss, but maybe there was something in me that sought out that loss. I read Emily Rapps insistently celebratory essays in Still Point of the Turning World, which are not so much about losing her young child to illness but about caring for him through it, living alongside him with such acuity and close attention. I read George Saunderss Lincoln in the Bardo, which was honest about the absurdity of death, how it brings us into helpless, ridiculous postures of yearning: a big gangly Abe Lincoln aching for his son among the almost-dead. I read Yiyun Lis astonishing novel Where Reasons End, an imagined conversation between a mother and her teenage son who has recently committed suicide. In this mothers imagining of her sons caustic, precocious voicein the deft conjuring of its sharpnesswe feel the ferocity of her desire to argue with him again, to feel his consciousness still pushing back against her own. When she tells him, I will be sad forever, he says, I thought you said you took forever out of your dictionary. She replies, You put it back for me.
I read Jake Rubins wise and moving and restless essay about reading in the aftermath of a close friends death; how even the language of grief didnt feel quite right. Humans had dreamed up a thing called permanence, a word with no actual referent, he wrote, and then gnashed their teeth and wept and accused the universe of being senseless because it didnt abide by this wishful conceit.
Patches of drool
Through summer and fall, I took long walks with my daughter as she kicked with delight at the sight of dogs peeing on trees, and covered the canvas flaps of her baby carrier with dark, spreading patches of drool. I listened to books that reminded me being a mother meant not one thing but billions of things. The babies in Octavia Butlers Kindred played with their feet by the fire but that didnt make the horror of American slavery disappear. Lacy M. Johnsons gorgeously painful memoir The Other Side charted the long shadow of trauma across parenthoodhow violence reached into those moments, a decade later, when she pulled away from her children or gave them food when they asked for love.

Rewarding organic vegetable gardens
Growing your own vegetables is both fun and rewarding. All you really need to get started is some decent soil and a few plants. But to be a really successful vegetable gardener  and to do it organically  youll need to understand what it takes to keep your plants healthy and vigorous. Here are the basics.
Make Efficient Use of Space
The location of your garden (the amount of sunlight it receives, proximity to a source of water, and protection from frost and wind) is important. Vegetable gardens that make efficient use of growing space are much easier to care for, whether you're talking about a few containers on the patio or a 50-by-100-foot plot in the backyard. Raised beds are a good choice for beginners because they make the garden more manageable.
Get Rid of Your Rows
The first way to maximize space in the garden is to convert from traditional row planting to 3- or 4-foot-wide raised beds. Single rows of crops, while they might be efficient on farms that use large machines for planting, cultivating, and harvesting, are often not the best way to go in the backyard vegetable garden. In a home-sized garden, the fewer rows you have, the fewer paths between rows you will need, and the more square footage you will have available for growing crops.
Grow Up, Not Out
Next to intensive planting, trellising represents the most efficient way to use space in the garden. People who have tiny gardens will want to grow as many crops as possible on vertical supports, and gardeners who have a lot of space will still need to lend physical support to some of their vegetables, such as climbing varieties of peas and pole beans. Other vegetables that are commonly trellised include vining crops, such as cucumbers and tomatoes.
The fence surrounding your garden may well do double-duty as a trellis, so long as the crops grown on the fence can be rotated in different years. Other kinds of vegetable supports are generally constructed from either wood or metal. However, no matter which design or materials you use, be sure to have your trellis up and in place well before the plants require its support  preferably even before you plant the crop. With some vegetables, such as tomatoes or melons, you may also have to tie the plants gently to the support, or carefully weave them through the trellis as they grow.
Keep Crops Moving
Crop rotation within the vegetable garden means planting the same crop in the same place only once every three years. This policy ensures that the same garden vegetables will not deplete the same nutrients year after year. It can also help foil any insect pests or disease pathogens that might be lurking in the soil after the crop is harvested.
To use a three-year crop rotation system, make a plan of the garden on paper during each growing season, showing the location of all crops. If, like most people, you grow a lot of different vegetables, these garden plans are invaluable, because it can be difficult to remember exactly what you were growing where even last season, much less two years ago. Saving garden plans for the past two or three years means that you don't have to rely on memory alone.
Keep Good Records
Just as drawing a garden plan each year helps you remember where things were growing, taking notes can help you avoid making the same mistakes again, or ensure that your good results can be reproduced in future years. For instance, write down all the names of different vegetable varieties, and compare them from year to year, so you will know which ones have done well in your garden.

Earlier this year, in March, the British Council in Sri Lanka partnered with Ricky Mendis to announce the launch of a new project to improve the quality of English language education in Sri Lanka, namely the Teacher Education for English, a British Council delivered project, which would contribute to improving the levels of teaching and learning in Sri Lanka.
Ricky Mendis is a well-known corporate leader who shares the British Councils vision of a thriving, globally connected Sri Lanka. His prompt response to the British Councils appeal resulted in a magnanimous donation of Rs 65.7 million to fund the entire project. My decision to fund this program arose from my concern for the employability of intelligent, qualified young men and women, who are handicapped by their woeful lack of knowledge and use of the English language, said Mendis.
The projects goal is to enhance students access to good education and employment opportunities by improving the quality of the teaching of English, the language most commonly used in higher education and the private sector. The project is a solid example of the way in which industry and prominent individuals can contribute towards both the development of the skills of young people to support them in securing employment and to the enhancement of Sri Lankas economic development through the improvement of the quality of teaching.
The Teacher Education for English Project (TEE) complements the British Councils Improving Teacher Education in Sri Lanka Project (ITESL), which focuses on the professional development and skills of teacher educators and principals.
A team of six British Council trainers arrived in the country in January this year and are deployed in the four colleges. These trainers are working closely with college faculty to ensure that they also cover the regular curriculum in these colleges.
Gill Caldicott, Country Director British Council Sri Lanka said, We are very pleased and proud to be delivering this project to improve the teaching and learning of English in Sri Lanka. Ricky Mendis vision for a globally connected Sri Lanka with good levels of English will find resonance with employers and educationalists country-wide. A brilliant initiative by a leading entrepreneur.

Surreal Days
So, its that time again. In the days ahead, we are all in for pieces of cotton-wool pasted on shop windows, glittery Christmas trees, George Michaels Last Christmas eternally on the radio channels and the inevitable query, Is there really someone called Santa
If you have grappled with this question ever since your baby could talk, you might find the answer inside the pages of Valentine Davies 70-year-old beloved holiday classic, Miracle on 34th Street.
Not surprisingly, Davies had got the idea for the story during the hustle and bustle of the holiday season. While he waited in a long line at a Department Store he wondered what Santa would have thought about everything that was going on in the name of Christmas; such expenditure, such glitter, such consumerism. He went home and turned his thoughts into a story, which soon became a movie script. In 1947, the movie was released in theaters, and Davis released the novella version of the original story. He would soon win an Academy Award for his creation.
Miracle on 34th Street is about a little girl called Susan who holds the same sentiments about Christmas as almost all the children we know today. She doesnt believe in Santa Claus or magic or miracles of any kind. Then, one day, she meets an old gentleman called Kris Kringle. As she doubtfully tells him the gifts she wishes for Christmas, deep down Susan finds herself hoping that just maybe, he is the real thing.
Davis introduces three Santas in his story. There is one Santa employed by Macys who is too intoxicated by the spirits of the season that he gets replaced right before the Thanksgiving Day Parade. There is young Alfred who plays St. Nick at the YMCA. And there is Kris Kringle who is certain he is Santa.
If you are shaking your head saying that cant be, you are not alone. Surely Kris is only a sweet, harmless, slightly crazy old man, or... is he actually him Well, lets check out the evidence. Kris is kind, wise, and very protective of others. He seems to be able to speak all the languages in the world. And, he is everything you would want in a Santa, right down to the beard and the twinkle in his eye. Besides, when he fills out his employment card, in addition to listing the North Pole as his birthplace he gives all of his reindeer as his next of kin.
And yet, the question remains. Is he, or is he not the real Santa Claus
The answer is a definite no if the most identifiable villain in the story, Granville Sawyer, can have his way. The cold, insecure psychologist at Macys insists Kris is crazy and dangerous with no evidence to prove he is Santa. After all on his employment form he does write in the space provided for date of birth, quoting Jonathan Swift: Im as old as my tongue and a little older than my teeth.
But Granville Sawyer is only a minor character, and while he is a bad person he is not some mega villain. The only other person who qualifies as a villain in the story is Susans mother, Mrs. Doris Walker, who was so hurt by her ex-husband she decided to raise her daughter not to believe in anything. She tells Susan, Santa is only a nice man with a white beard. Dorris holds a high position at Macys and hires Kris but later fires him after he insists to Susan he is Santa. Mrs. Walker is not evil, though; shes just pragmatic, and highly protective of the fantastic daughter she has brought up, alone, while rising to an important position at a prestigious company. But eventually she comes to believe in Kris too.
To make a not-so-long story shorter (and not caring about spoilers since the story is 70 years old), when Kringle ends up in danger of being sent to an institution for mental illness a young lawyer named Fred Gailey who lives next door to Susan and her mother takes up the case and tries to prove Santa is real in a court of law.
And so, at one point, Fred tells Doris he doesnt mind getting fired from his current law firm for taking Kris Kringles case. He will just start his own firm instead. Doris disapproves and asks what kind of cases he thinks he will get. Fred responds: Oh, probably other people who are being pushed around like Kris. Thats the only fun in law anyway.
This leads to an argument between the couple about the intangibles that Doris thinks reason and common sense show to be of lesser value. Fred responds: Its not just Kris thats on trial, its everything he stands for. Its kindness and joy and love and all the other intangibles.
So begins the trial of the century, in which, somehow, reason and belief must be made compatible. Just as when Fred begins to think he is about to lose his case, however, Fate intervenes. A bunch of postal workers realize they can dump their bags of Dear Santa letters at the courthouse because Kris lives there now. Fred realizes the delivery serves as proof that Kris must be the one-and-only Santa Claus and wins the case.
By the time the story ends Kris Kringle has achieved his goal. He has renewed the spirit of Christmas, the spirit of giving and kindness. He accomplishes this, especially with Doris and Susan, which he feels is a great victory. He ends up teaching Susan what its like to believe in something that doesnt make sense.
If you are still skeptical, though, let me quote Fred: Look Doris, someday youre going to find that your way of facing this realistic world just doesnt work. And when you do, dont overlook those lovely intangibles. Youll discover those are the only things that are worthwhile.
So, yes, call me a romantic but I would fall for Miracle on 34th Street every time I read it. Now that its December its hard to resist this heartwarming story about generosity, imagination, and the spirit of Christmas.

Sustaining democracy
It is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both. Niccolo Machiavelli, Prince 1532
St. Augustines City of God was perhaps the book President Sirisena was following since the beginning of his Presidency in 2015. A kind and calm leader from humble beginnings was seen trying to be righteous, yet appeared cornered, isolated and perhaps pushed to the wall by his coalition partners. That is why, it seems, he decided to borrow political ideas from another book which was banned as soon as it came into print. This book is another Italian masterpiece, Machiavellis Prince. This book had once helped Queen Elizabeth I to create a golden age while assassinating the people who went against her, a terror far worse than her father Henry the VIIIs time.
Machiavelli advised in the Prince that the prince be a lion and a fox at the same time; the former to frighten wolves, the latter to detect snares. Elizabeth I was a combination of both, turning adversaries against each other, keeping steady on the tightrope she walked with patriotism. In the same manner, President Sirisena appointed Rajapaksa  a move that the entire nation or the coalition partners never contemplated, dismantled and stripped the power of the former Prime Minister the same way as he treated Sirisena, according to a Presidential adviser who completely ignored advice of the President when making decisions in the bipartisan model.
Matching to the last trick, in 1571 the most elaborate plot was to assassinate Elizabeth I and install Mary Stuart on the throne. Florentine banker Roberto Ridolfi was planning this plot connecting Pius V, King Philip, and the Duke of Alba which Elizabeths spymasters tracked and exposed at the right time.
In the same way, the plot to assassinate President Sirisena was revealed with recorded conversations and investigations taking place at the same time, where another nation appeared involved, indirectly. The investigations will tell if there was such a real plot to assassinate the President. Just like in the ancient time, President Sirisena will use the exact words of Machiavelli to crush all his adversaries with the help of the man whom he contested against in 2015, and perhaps use the same nation who supported his election victory, calling and requesting assistance on the assassination plot.
So in an article titled Leviathan (sea monster) authored a few months ago, I had appealed to the leader to follow the work of Hobbes who wrote of a central figure with authority than a weak figure at the centre who was seen by many as a puppet on strings.
President Sirisena, like Elizabeth I, was a strange leader who perhaps never took advice. Ambassador to Philip of Spain in England, Count de Feria wrote, Elizabeth is a very strange sort of womenshe is determined to be governed by no one.
She was calm to the public even at the time of much rebellion and chaos, in the same way President Sirisena was calmly watching the success of his pet project, the Moragahakanda reservoir, opening the sluice gate while one of the gatekeepers of democracy, the Parliament, was in chaos and trending on social media and television screens.
The entire nation observed fist-fighting between the honourable representatives of the highest democratic institution.
Perhaps a question could be raised if political parties who are essential gatekeepers of democracy had given election nominations to the right kind of candidates to become peoples representatives
While many leaders from history practised Machiavellian philosophy, another document keeps leaders from engaging in authoritarian acts.
The national Constitution represents that document with a long history from the time of Hammurabis code, which codified 282 laws to govern Babylon, to the modern-day English Protectorate introduced after the English Civil War by Oliver Cromwell.
But all Constitutions also have had their flaws. The US Constitution does little to prevent the
President from doing undemocratic things such as filling the FBI or other independent government agency with obedient subjects nor does it prevent a President from acting by decree when issuing Executive orders. President Trump is seen today exercising these undemocratic practices and further interfering with the Judiciary by calling his Chief Justice an Obama judge, while the judge denies this allegation.
So how does a democracy sustain its credibility What keeps a democracy going is an adherence to the unwritten rules, and it thrives on two things according to Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatts book How Democracies Die: mutual tolerance and institutional forbearance. Mutual tolerance means that participants of a democratic system, that is, the political rivals to power should not brand each other a enemies, traitors or criminals. In recent past, this axiom has been repeatedly undermined in the Sri Lankan Parliament.
In the 1960s in Chile, mutual tolerance began to erode between the two political camps. In August 1973 when the Chamber of Deputies declared the government unconstitutional, it triggered a military coup led by right-wing power, and for the next 17 years, Augusto Pinochet was in power.
There is a grave danger when mutual tolerance is lost and the political opponents are seen as traitors or part of a plot to assassinate the Executive.
In a similar manner, autocracy could creep into system with the gradual erosion of democracy. In Peru, when Alberto Fujimori failed to deliver economic progress through democratic means he took the law into his hand ignoring the courts and the Constitution. On August 5, 1992, he dissolved Congress and suspended the constitution. Fujimoris transformation from a democratic leader to a dictator was piecemeal.
Institutional forbearance means refraining from actions that would undermine the spirit of democracy  even if the act is technically legal or not prohibited by the Constitution. For example, George Washington exercised this by limiting his term, serving only twice as President even when there were no set term limits in the Constitution. In Sri Lanka, institutional forbearance was lost when the past regime scrapped the Presidential term limit and took control of all independent commissions  an act which made the former President unpopular.
However, President Sirisenas recent move to remove the Prime Minister was done on many grounds according to the President, but there was one point which made his case accepted. This was breach of national security by former Prime Minister during his conduct in office, seen by some as being an agent of another nation not working for the national interest.
In 2004, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga fired the same Prime Minister on the grounds of national security, after he signed an agreement with another nation without her consent.
The present situation has to return to normalcy at some point. I hope that the leaders would go back to the people to unlock the present gridlock between the Executive and the Legislature.
In the long run, a political culture of mutual tolerance and institutional forbearance needs to be restored to preserve South Asias oldest democracy. Or else, Sri Lanka could drift towards a worse form of government, a dictatorship with its main gatekeeper of democracy  the Parliament  crippled and the Judiciary undermined.
President Sirisena should shelve Machiavelli and revisit the work City of God by St. Augustine.
It is important to understand that the dismantling of democracy can be a gradual imperceptible process that may elude our day-to-day priorities. But once begun, this drift can take a long time to restore and redo what is lost, which may take a very long time to rebuild.

Symonds reveals Singhs emotional apology over monkeygate
PERTH, Sunday - Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh broke down crying when he finally made up with Andrew Symonds after the infamous monkeygate scandal had sent the Australian all-rounder into a downward spiral, he revealed Sunday.
A decade on from the ugly incident in the 2008 Sydney Test, where Singh was accused of calling Symonds a monkey, the Australian said they emotionally called a truce three years later. It happened when the pair were awkwardly reunited by the Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League. We go to a very wealthy man's place for a barbecue, drinks and dinner one night and the whole team's there and he had guests there, and Harbhajan said mate, can I speak to you for a minute out in the garden out the front, Symonds told Fox Sports. He goes, look, I've got to say sorry to you for what I did to you in Sydney. I apologise, I hope I didn't cause you, your family, your friends too much harm and I really apologise for what I said, I shouldn't have said it'. And he actually broke down crying, and I could just see that was a huge weight off his shoulders, he had to get rid of it. We shook hands and I gave him a hug and said: Mate, it's all good. It's dealt with'.
Singh, who at time denied any wrongdoing, was charged with racial abuse and suspended for three matches. But the ban was overturned when India threatened to quit the tour in what was an all-time low in India-Australia cricket relations. It left Symonds feeling let down by the system while the need for teammates and close friends Matthew Hayden, Adam Gilchrist, Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke to step up as witnesses weighed on his conscience.
Symonds, who was born in England with one of his parents of West Indian background, has previously recounted how his life went downhill after the incident.
He started drinking heavily and in June 2009 his Cricket Australia contract was withdrawn after he was sent home from the World Twenty20 following the latest in a series of alcohol-related indiscretions.
I suppose this would be the moment where my whole persona to cricket changed, Symonds, who is commentating on India's current tour of Australia, said of monkeygate.
I didn't realise how powerful one player, one incident, how much money was at stake and the ramifications.  AFP

Touch of transcendent beauty
Landscaping can be divided into soft landscaping features and hard landscaping features. In the previous two articles we discussed soft landscaping. This article explores hard landscaping features which are important in bringing out the beauty in a garden. Green Thumbs features Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Office Ratmalana, District Agriculture Instructor K. N. K. Jayathilake who touched on water gardens and statues.
To create hard landscaping features, we have to use building materials where the skill, creativity and ingenuity of the creator matter. For this stone, gravel, bricks, sand, concrete, timber and metal are used. To create sculptures stone, metal, glass, pottery and wood carvings are used. Right throughout history people have used sculptures in their gardens as an expression of their innermost selves and desires, said Jayathilake.
Ancient Sculptures
Sources tell us the Western tradition of sculpture began in ancient Greece. The Greeks were famous for their sculptures of gods and goddesses. The statue of Nike ((c.190 BC), the Greek goddess of victory, is one of the few remaining Hellenistic sculptures that is a Greek original.
The Terracotta Army (210209 BC) discovered in 1974 (out of which one of them is the most famous statues in history) is an enormous legion of clay statues of soldiers buried in three massive pits near the tomb of Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China, who died in 210 BC. They were meant to protect him in the afterlife. These statues are an expression of the human psyche expressed in building materials similar to statues in gardens.
In Sri Lanka a good example is Geoffrey Bawas garden which was filled with statues that expressed his inner-self. Meanwhile, artists such as Isamu Noguchi, David Smith, Alexander Calder, Jean Tinguely, Richard Lippold, George Rickey, Louise Bourgeois, and Louise Nevelson defined the look of modern sculptor.
These structures need to be appropriate for the place and perfect for the garden, because soft landscaping and hard landscaping must be used together in such a way that brings beauty to the garden and enhances the natural look. If the positioning is wrong and soft landscaping features and hard landscaping features combine in a way that does not make the garden look beautiful then there might come a situation where the entire garden will need to be altered costing you time, money and giving you a sense of frustration, said Jayathilake.
Water Gardens
This is especially true when it comes to creating water gardens. Water has been intrinsic to human life. It is the life giver and the Greeks even designated a god  Poseidon to show the importance of water. Indeed it has been revered through history.
We are naturally attracted to water. It gives us pleasure and is soothing to the mind. The rhythm of the flowing water is so relaxing and soothing giving you supreme mental satisfaction. The plants and fish swimming in the pond bring out the power of mother nature, stated Jayathilake.
There are four types of water gardens  waterfalls, water streams, ponds and fountains. All these must be positioned in place that is suitable to the garden because some ponds and fountains cannot be easily removed and shifted. Some waterfalls can be used indoors and can be created using stone, concrete and fiber glass. Some are built to be a permanent feature in the garden. That is why the Hard Landscaping features need to be positioned correctly. However if you take fiber glass waterfalls, you can move them wherever you want. They can be purchased from the market.
A collection of sculpture in a garden setting can be called a sculpture garden. Research findings reveal the oldest known collection of human constructions is a Neanderthal sculpture garden unearthed in Bruniquel Cave in France in 1990. An ice hotel is a temporary hotel made up of snow and sculpted blocks of ice. These hotels can be found in Canada, Finland, Japan, Norway, Romania, Sweden and Switzerland. It is logical to assume that the ice sculptures will be located in these hotels.
Garden designer, Rev David Coles stated  A good garden design, while being on the one hand a serious discipline should embody a playful creative mindfulness. He postulated that successful garden designs enable transcendence from a physical sensory experience to a mindful awareness of being interconnected with nature.
****
TIPS FOR CREATING PONDS AND STATUES
* Remember to keep the statues in places where the sunlight is able to interact with it creating lighting effects  light and shade.
* Must take into account the size and width of the water fall and the pond beneath it. Pond must be in proportion to the waterfall. There is a submersible pump to recycle the water. If the pond is too small and the water flow from the waterfall is too strong that would create problems for the pump and also for the area near the pond.
* The shape of the pond also needs to be taken into consideration. It has to be very similar to a pond you get in a forest area or village. If it is round or square then it make the pond look artificial.
* The sound of the water also needs to be pleasing. On the waterfall you need to position stones so the water will run around it creating that gushing, soothing and sweet noise. This all gives someone the effect of naturalness.
* There should be trees in the background.
* In the water ponds having plants really adds to the value. The beauty they bring is truly pleasing. Eg - Blue Water Lily, Water Lily, Lotus and Pistia.
* In the waterfall itself you can include water loving ornamental plants. Eg- ferns. Around the water pond as well you can include ornamental plants.
* Hanging plants can be fitted into the waterfall.
* Garden Lights can be used in the night creating that ethereal effect when the light dances atop water. A shimmering and beautiful way nature is expressed.
* Ornamental fish can be used.

Towards an equity-focused educational system
Hundreds of thesis, reports and papers have been written and presentations made on what ails our educational system. But, one aspect that does not seem to get enough attention is the role of our educational system in continuing the social disparity.
This disparity relates to the broad spectrum of quality differences in our education system reflected by the different types of schools. At one end of the spectrum, we have schools which boast highest quality education with excellent facilities and their usage of English as the medium of instruction. These are known as International schools, privately owned, which charge hefty fees and, hence, are out of reach for children from the less privileged families. They tutor their students to sit foreign examinations.
At the other end of the spectrum are the typical state-owned rural schools including schools in the estate sector, with dilapidated structures without basic amenities, where teachers hardly have the skills or motivation to do justice to their jobs. As we move the middle of the spectrum, into the urban and city areas, we can see state-run schools with multi-story buildings, playgrounds and facilities which even international schools do not have.
The state-owned schools are also segmented into different types. There are National schools, (the prestigious lot), followed by 1 AB, 1 C, Type 2 and Type 3 schools. Type 3 schools may conduct classes from year 1 to 5 or year 1 to 8. They are the schools with the least amount of facilities and most of them are located in small towns, rural areas and estate sector.
Social divide
The basic idea of public education is that it serves to level the playing field, serving as a motor for social mobility by providing equal learning opportunities for all students. Regrettably, our 80-year old free education system could yet not assure everyone access to equal levels of education in all schools. In fact, our education system made inequality worse, systematically giving more affluent students better access to rigorous science and mathematics content  which is of critical importance in todays high-tech economy.
The need to minimise the urban-rural and rural-plantation divide has for long been pointed out by educationists and eventually accepted by all governments. But, to date, very little has been done.
When the educational system in a country exhibits inequality in content, such exposure will tend to have more rigid social classes. In other words, rather than levelling the playing field, schools may be tipping the scales. Instead of providing more equal opportunities, the inequalities that are rife in schools might be constraining those opportunities  and thereby calling into question the legitimacy of that countrys democracy itself.
That is why, promoting more equal opportunities in schools must be a priority for our Government. Maybe, schools alone cant solve the underlying problems facing the society, but its hard to imagine how well foster greater social equity if schools are not part of the solution.
Insufficient allocations
Along with a commitment to educational attainment, it is imperative for state policymakers of education, therefore to harness their power to make equity-focused policy decisions. All students, estate, rural or urban, should be afforded the opportunity to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve their future goals. Educational equality means that all students receive equal access to the same educational pathways and not simply levelling the field. The inequities in our education system should not continue to stifle those opportunities.
Over two third of the Government schools are located outside cities and most of them are in rural areas and small cities. Delivering equal school services and ensuring equal educational opportunities to areas with thinly scattered populations continues to be a challenge for the Provincial government and education authorities.
Over the past two decades, hundreds of such schools have closed causing very real harm to the communities in which they were located. This was a result of the insufficient education allocations of the Government.
Provincial Councils might have been able to save some of these schools if they had adequate overall budgets. However, austerity budgets provided by government meant that Councils had little flexibility to make decisions to keep open schools that they and the community did not want to close.
The decreasing trend in government spending for education over the years was brought into public focus by the Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA) and other organisations. In this context, the request was to allocate 6% of GDP was popularised, which was the recommended state expenditure in education by UNESCO.
For example, in 2015, allocation for education was 2.07% of GDP. In 2016, it increased to 3.7% of GDP amounting to Rs. 461 bn, out of which Rs.121 bn is for capital carrying costs of the government. If we take out this amount, allocation becomes 2.72 of GDP. A larger portion of the education budget is allocated for physical infrastructure investment, for construction of school buildings, universities and vocational training institutes.
Addressing the need for basic facilities, such as toilets, drinking water and electricity for all schools and upgrading of plantation and rural schools are much needed investments which seem to have ignored. In addition, investment in developing teaching capacity particularly in rural schools, their salary adjustments and uplifting the quality of education was also lacking.
Educational investment has to be planned and projected within the broader economy, and the particularly solving the problems facing education, particularly of rural schools and students. Disparities in education levels at rural schools are interlinked with the crisis facing the rural economy. Therefore, a programme for improving standards of rural schools should be accompanied by investments to uplift the rural economy.
Turnover among teachers
Another problem faced by the rural schools is the high turnover among teachers and administrators. Retaining teachers in rural and remote areas also continues to be challenging. Naturally, the teachers like to work in schools either close to their homes or in urban areas, which are socially more attractive than rural or plantation schools far from home. On the other hand, the teachers serving in remote areas are under duress they are unlikely to show much interest in serving the educational purpose of the rural pupils.
It normally takes several years for teachers to become acquainted with the life of a particular school - especially a small rural school where a thorough understanding of children in all aspects of their development is important. Frequent arrivals and departures on the part of teachers promote a climate of instability and do little to enhance the involvement of teachers in the general life of the community.
Solutions
The Government and the Councils can develop specific programmes to address the problems of rural teacher retention. First of all, an attractive special allowance could be offered monthly for their services. Decent accommodation also could be provided for those who need, the cost of which to be borne by the Government.
The degree to which a rural teacher becomes involved in community, educational and cultural programmes influences his or her decision to remain; therefore, retention requires a coordinated school-community effort. A school-community orientation can help new rural teachers overcome feelings of isolation, acquire a sense of community security, and develop professional competence.
The community should recognize new teachers accomplishments and invite them to participate in various activities. Universities also can play an important role by offering cost-effective distance-learning courses to keep rural teachers up-to-date. There are many more incentives one can think of.
It is also crucial that all teachers, especially rural teachers, have as many opportunities as possible for professional development. Possible offerings to consider include research, graduate studies, in-service education programmes, self-directed professional development, special educational leave, participating in exchange programmes are few of them.

A triumph for democracy
Yesterday marked a Red Letter Day for democracy in this country of 21 million people where the attempts of dark forces of anarchy to trample on the free will of the people were resoundly defeated, restoring their sovereignty and independence. The people who cherish democracy owe an eternal debt to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was sworn last morning as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, for walking the gauntlet all the way in achieving for them this victory.
Had he baulked at the unequal challenge that confronted him since the day he was illegally deposed as Prime Minister on October 26 and allowed the forces of anarchy to prevail it would certainly have spelt the end to democracy and constitutional rule in Sri Lanka. The true democrat that he was, he fought his way according to the rule book and his unflappable demeanour and composure, amidst heavy odds, should be a lesson for all budding politicians who are wedded to democracy.
He did not sway from his insistence that he was still the Prime Minister of this country and was the rightful occupant of Temple Trees, knowing full well the might of the military and the police were in the hands of the illegal Government. His implicit faith in the eventual triumph of democracy, no matter what peril it was being subjected to, is also testament to his determination not to allow the vitiation of a system that the people of Sri Lanka had been nurtured on since we gained universal adult franchise in 1935.
To Wickremesinghe also goes the kudos of being the symbolic figure who protected democracy which was being assailed from within the system for the first time in this country. Earlier democracy was under threat from external forces. For the first time in the post-independence history of this country democracy was under siege when two insurgences broke out in 1971 and 1989/90 threatening the system. Both revolts were quelled by the Armed Forces. However, post October 26, democracy was undermined by actors who functioned within the system and had a good chance of success given that the Armed Forces, this time, were under the control of the usurpers. It is in this context that Premier Wickremesinghes role assumes historic importance.
Sri Lankans who cherish democracy should also salute the role played by the Judiciary for rescuing the system from what threatened to be its imminent collapse, through its impartial arbitration of matters that came before it. Their Lordships of both, the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal, certainly delivered their verdicts in keeping with the Constitutional provisions. The unanimity reached by the seven member Supreme Court Bench that held the dissolution of Parliament illegal left no doubt, whatsoever, in the minds of the public that those responsible had acted outside the Constitution, the Supreme Law of the country.
It should be a matter for gratification for all that the countrys Judiciary has today asserted its independence, removing all doubts that existed on the impartiality of our courts. For this, the credit should undoubtedly go to the former Yahapalanaya Government for establishing the Independent Commissions which has ensured that no judicial officer could be subjected to intimidation by the Executive, like in the past. Their Lordships have opened a new chapter in the countrys judicial history that will now restore the confidence of the public in the judiciary that was virtually under siege pre-19A.
Credit, in full measure, should also go to the various Presidents Counsel and other legal luminaries who argued their briefs forcefully and convincingly in placing in clear terms the true constitutional position before their Lordships. Their contribution towards upholding democracy and constitutional governance, thus, should therefore be treasured in the highest measure. The role played by the numerous legal experts such as former law professors through their opinions published in the media in debunking the theories of charlatans, imposters and pretenders who tried to mislead the public by giving their own interpretation of the Constitution is also not inconsiderable.
Last but not the least, the individual who should deservedly take a bow from the entire nation and certainly those who cherish democracy and democratic ideals is none other than Speaker Deshabandu Karu Jayasuriya. All right thinking people of this country would unhesitatingly agree that, but for his valiant efforts to hold his ground amidst physical threats and even danger to his very life (there were reports of a planned acid attack on him) in warding off attempts by anarchic elements to render democracy in tatters, autocratic rule would certainly have been enthroned in this country by now. He did not flinch in his endeavour to protect democracy and the supremacy of the legislature that is the fountainhead of the sovereignty of the people, amidst all the indignities, insults, humiliations and bodily harm he and the very office of Speaker was subjected to.
For this, his name will occupy a prominent place among the pantheon of world figures who made sacrifices, risking their lives, in the endeavour of protecting democracy and freedom for their people.

Wondering how to start a garden
Never gardened before No problem. Make your grow-you-own dreams a reality with these easy-to-follow tips.
Site it right
Starting a garden is just like real estate it's all about location. Place your garden in a part of your yard where you'll see it regularly (out of sight, out of mind definitely applies to gardening). That way, you'll be much more likely to spend time in it.
Follow the sun
Misjudging sunlight is a common pitfall when you're first learning to garden. Pay attention to how sunlight plays through your yard before choosing a spot for your garden. Most edible plants, including many vegetables, herbs, and fruits, need at least six hours of sun in order to thrive.
Stay close to water
One of the best gardening tips you'll ever get is to plan your new garden near a water source. Make sure you can run a hose to your garden site, so you don't have to lug water to it each time your plants get thirsty. The best way to tell if plants need watering is to push a finger an inch down into the soil (that's about one knuckle deep). If it's dry, it's time to water.
Start with great soil
When starting a garden, one of the top pieces of advice is to invest in soil that is nutrient-rich and well-drained.
Consider containers
When space is at a premium, look to containers. You can grow many plants in pots, including vegetables, herbs, flowers, fruit trees, berries, and shrubs.
Choose the right plants
It's important to select plants that match your growing conditions. This means putting sun-loving plants into a sunny spot, choosing heat-tolerant plants in warm climates, and giving ground-gobbling vines like pumpkins and melons ample elbow room (or a trellis to climb). Do your homework and pick varieties that will grow well where you live and in the space you have. And to get a step up on success when growing veggies and herbs, start with vigorous young plants instead of trying to grow from seed.
Add some mulch
Apply a layer of mulch that's 2 to 3 inches deep around each plant. This will help reduce weeds by blocking out the sun, and reduce moisture loss through evaporation, so you have to water less. For a polished look, you can put down straw, shredded leaves, pine straw, or some other locally available material.
Feed plants regularly
Plants look their best when they get all the nutrition they need.

Working-class heroine
It was an irresistible idea: to invite Americas former First Lady Michelle Obama to discuss her new book with the Nigerian superstar novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Staging the event in a venue with a capacity of 2,700, however, was akin to squeezing the Glastonbury Festival into someones back garden. When tickets went on sale for Becoming: An evening with Michelle Obama in the Southbank Centres Royal Festival Hall, it sparked a rush like no other. Why not just do it at the Royal Albert Hall grumbled one Facebook commenter after discovering she was 8,000th out of 55,000 in the online ticket queue. The physical queue began at 2.30am, and the Southbank Centres annual membership rocketed.
With such intense demand for tickets, many wondered just what type of audience would make it to the event. It turned out to be an equitable cross-section. 300 tickets were reserved for charities and schoolchildren. Among the high-profile attenders were the Labour politician Diane Abbott, the actress Michaela Coel, the former Olympic champion heptathlete Denise Lewis, the supermodel Adwoa Aboah, and the broadcaster June Sarpong. The preponderance of black female celebrities was reflected in the crowd as a whole, in which women outnumbered men significantly. The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, the presenter Jon Snow and the author Alan Hollinghurst made for relatively rare male sightings. So when the lights finally dimmed and Michelle Obama entered the stage, the cheers reached soprano levels. All right, everyone, deep breath, said Adichie.
Straight talker
The excitement was fully justified. Funny, insightful and analytical, Michelle Obama impressed hugely as she spoke about her life and her memoir Becoming.
Obama talked emotionally about her late father, a highly intelligent blue-collar worker from South Side, Chicago who saw a flame in Michelle and sought to keep it alive: to have that flame lit in a girl means you have to value her voice and let her speak. Her dad was a straight talker whose dinner table conversation went so far as the responsible joys of sex. Obama recalled a time he cashed his entire monthly pay-check so that he could physically demonstrate to his children the costs of running a household.
We make the mistake that working-class people arent gifted, Obama lamented. Talent is spread equally among humanity . . . I knew that I had a brain that was superior. I knew that I had a creative mind. And I knew when people werent investing in me. Much of the audience seemed to identify with her comment about how teachers make assumptions about their students because of their skin colour.
One of Obamas funnier anecdotes described the time when the Queen personally collected the Obamas in her car and Michelle became overwhelmed by the protocol instructions. Oh, its all rubbish, Her Majesty told her, just get in.
Title of spouse
Obamas White House years occupy only a third of her memoir because it is only a bit of what defines me as a person. You lose yourself in the title of spouse, she added. Nonetheless, she credited her husband for helping her think more broadly about her life. He doesnt play games, fellas, Obama said, wagging her finger as the crowd cheered. A very attractive quality. She reminisced about first dating Barack, who asked her, Can I kiss you Thats a lesson in consent! Adichie interjected, and the audience roared with laughter.
Obama was most compelling when discussing the psychology of poverty. Drawing on her working-class roots in Chicago, she described the fear that can hold back poor people: fear of being stopped by the police, or going outside your neighbourhood. I can find friends my age still living in the same house, doing the same thing . . . and I know its because of fear. Bright young girls must also contend with their own familys fear of their success, of rising beyond what their family knows for you. You find yourself in this hard gap. You dont belong at home with your family . . . and its often the parents who will hold a kid back. Not because they dont want their success or because they dont love them, but theyre afraid of the unknown.
In another life Michelle Obama might have been a psychologist. I hadnt fully appreciated what an effective bridge she creates between the working class and social elite, with her ability to illustrate a practical pathway to success. Shes a genuine working-class heroine.
Self-doubt
When Adichie asked Obama what message she would give to young black women navigating the world today, she advised them to ignore the self-doubt that comes from being constantly told dont reach too high, dont talk too loud. We walk around with those demons in our heads. You have to slay the dragon in your own mind. This is something Obama knows that only too well. Maliciously inaccurate media depictions of her as an Angry Black Woman who emasculates her husband still rankle. That chapter of her memoir, she said, was the hardest one to write.
People will literally take our voice, she said of black women in the US. They will take the things from us that they like  our style, our swag. It becomes co-opted, but then were demonized. We are angry; were too loud. How dare I have a voice and use it . . . . People can literally take our words and co-opt them as their own. The audience giggled at what could well have been a dig at Melania Trump, who was accused of plagiarizing one of Obamas speeches during her husbands election campaign.
Without mentioning the current US President explicitly, Adichie asked Obama about her thoughts on the Trump era. Change is not a straight line, she replied. We must make sacrifices now in the knowledge that we may not live to see the results.
The audience groaned when Adichie wrapped things up. Ten more minutes! someone cried out. But to no avail  Obama exited the stage to the tune of Stevie Wonders Signed, Sealed, Delivered, leaving us floored at how quickly ninety minutes had passed.

Your weight, watch out!
Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health.
Body mass index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify overweight and obesity in adults. It is defined as a persons weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg/m2).
For adults, WHO defines overweight and obesity as follows:
overweight is a BMI greater than or equal to 25; a obesity is a BMI greater than or equal to 30.
BMI provides the most useful population-level measure of overweight and obesity as it is the same for both sexes and for all ages of adults. However, it should be considered a rough guide because it may not correspond to the same degree of fatness in different individuals.
For children, age needs to be considered when defining overweight and obesity.
For children under 5 years of age: overweight is weight-for-height greater than 2 standard deviations above WHO Child Growth Standards median; and obesity is weight-for-height greater than 3 standard deviations above the WHO Child Growth Standards median.
Charts and tables: WHO child growth standards for children aged under 5 years Children aged between 519 years
Overweight and obesity are defined as follows for children aged between 519 years overweight is BMI-for-age greater than 1 standard deviation above the WHO Growth Reference median; and obesity is greater than 2 standard deviations above the WHO Growth Reference median.
Charts and tables: WHO growth reference for children aged between 519 years
Facts about overweight and obesity
Some recent WHO global estimates follow.
In 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults aged 18 years and older were overweight. Of these over 650 million adults were obese.
In 2016, 39% of adults aged 18 years and over (39% of men and 40% of women) were overweight.
Overall, about 13% of the worlds adult population (11% of men and 15% of women) were obese in 2016.
The worldwide prevalence of obesity nearly tripled between 1975 and 2016.
In 2016, an estimated 41 million children under the age of 5 years were overweight or obese. Once considered a high-income country problem, overweight and obesity are now on the rise in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in urban settings. In Africa, the number of overweight children under 5 has increased by nearly 50 per cent since 2000. Nearly half of the children under 5 who were overweight or obese in 2016 lived in Asia.
Over 340 million children and adolescents aged 5-19 were overweight or obese in 2016.
The prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents aged 5-19 has risen dramatically from just 4% in 1975 to just over 18% in 2016. The rise has occurred similarly among both boys and girls: in 2016 18% of girls and 19% of boys were overweight.
While just under 1% of children and adolescents aged 5-19 were obese in 1975, more 124 million children and adolescents (6% of girls and 8% of boys) were obese in 2016.
Overweight and obesity are linked to more deaths worldwide than underweight. Globally there are more people who are obese than underweight  this occurs in every region except parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.
What causes obesity and overweight
The fundamental cause of obesity and overweight is an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended. Globally, there has been: an increased intake of energy-dense foods that are high in fat; and an increase in physical inactivity due to the increasingly sedentary nature of many forms of work, changing modes of transportation, and increasing urbanization.
Changes in dietary and physical activity patterns are often the result of environmental and societal changes associated with development and lack of supportive policies in sectors such as health, agriculture, transport, urban planning, environment, food processing, distribution, marketing, and education.
What are common health consequences of overweight and obesity
Raised BMI is a major risk factor for noncommunicable diseases such as: cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart disease and stroke), which were the leading cause of death in 2012; diabetes; musculoskeletal disorders (especially osteoarthritis  a highly disabling degenerative disease of the joints); some cancers (including endometrial, breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and colon).
The risk for these noncommunicable diseases increases, with increases in BMI.
Childhood obesity is associated with a higher chance of obesity, premature death and disability in adulthood. But in addition to increased future risks, obese children experience breathing difficulties, increased risk of fractures, hypertension, early markers of cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and psychological effects.
Facing a double burden of disease
Many low- and middle-income countries are now facing a double burden of disease.
While these countries continue to deal with the problems of infectious diseases and undernutrition, they are also experiencing a rapid upsurge in noncommunicable disease risk factors such as obesity and overweight, particularly in urban settings.
It is not uncommon to find undernutrition and obesity co-existing within the same country, the same community and the same household.
Children in low- and middle-income countries are more vulnerable to inadequate pre-natal, infant, and young child nutrition. At the same time, these children are exposed to high-fat, high-sugar, high-salt, energy-dense, and micronutrient-poor foods, which tend to be lower in cost but also lower in nutrient quality. These dietary patterns, in conjunction with lower levels of physical activity, result in sharp increases in childhood obesity while undernutrition issues remain unsolved.
How can overweight and obesity be reduced
Overweight and obesity, as well as their related noncommunicable diseases, are largely preventable. Supportive environments and communities are fundamental in shaping peoples choices, by making the choice of healthier foods and regular physical activity the easiest choice (the choice that is the most accessible, available and affordable), and therefore preventing overweight and obesity.
At the individual level, people can: limit energy intake from total fats and sugars; increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, as well as legumes, whole grains and nuts; and engage in regular physical activity (60 minutes a day for children and 150 minutes spread through the week for adults).
Individual responsibility can only have its full effect where people have access to a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, at the societal level it is important to support individuals in following the recommendations above, through sustained implementation of evidence based and population based policies that make regular physical activity and healthier dietary choices available, affordable and easily accessible to everyone, particularly to the poorest individuals. An example of such a policy is a tax on sugar sweetened beverages.
The food industry can play a significant role in promoting healthy diets by:
reducing the fat, sugar and salt content of processed foods; ensuring that healthy and nutritious choices are available and affordable to all consumers; restricting marketing of foods high in sugars, salt and fats, especially those foods aimed at children and teenagers; and ensuring the availability of healthy food choices and supporting regular physical activity practice in the workplace.
WHO response
Adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2004, the WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health describes the actions needed to support healthy diets and regular physical activity. The Strategy calls upon all stakeholders to take action at global, regional and local levels to improve diets and physical activity patterns at the population level.
The Political Declaration of the High Level Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases of September 2011, recognizes the critical importance of reducing unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. The political declaration commits to advancing the implementation of the WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, including, where appropriate, through the introduction of policies and actions aimed at promoting healthy diets and increasing physical activity in the entire population.
WHO has also developed the Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 2013-2020 which aims to achieve the commitments of the UN Political Declaration on Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) which was endorsed by Heads of State and Government in September 2011. The Global Action Plan will contribute to progress on 9 global NCD targets to be attained by 2025, including a 25% relative reduction in premature mortality from NCDs by 2025 and a halt in the rise of global obesity to match the rates of 2010.
The World Health Assembly welcomed the report of the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity (2016) and its 6 recommendations to address the obesogenic environment and critical periods in the life course to tackle childhood obesity. The implementation plan to guide countries in taking action to implement the recommendations of the Commission was welcomed by the World Health Assembly in 2017.

India to be worlds fastest growing  economy with 7 to 8% growth rate
Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said India will clock a growth rate of 7 to 8 per cent despite global uncertainties and will retain the tag of the worlds fastest growing major economy. He said the economy is now fairly large to display a certain degree of resilience.
Speaking at the inauguration of the FICCI Annual General Meeting in New Delhi yesterday, Jatley, said the government will stick to the 3.3% fiscal deficit target in the current financial year. He said there is a need to focus on several unreformed sectors in the economy. He also cited the need to improve credit flow and tackle liquidity.
The Minister said the government intends to overtake the UK in terms of GDP and come close to Japan in terms of GDP not per capita income in course of the next few years.
Investor confidence in Indian assets had only recently bounced back, helped by a slide in oil prices and a dovish tone from the Federal Reserve. November saw the best rupee gains in nearly seven years, while local stocks saw their best month since July.

President has taken bold decision to appoint Ranil
The hope and aspiration of the people in the Matale district is that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will join hands with the youth sections of the party, including with Sajith Premadasa, Navin Dissanayake and others and work for the common good of the nation, with the interests of the poor and downtrodden masses at heart, Dambulla electorate UNP organiser Priyan Wijeratne said.
He was speaking to the media after joining party supporters and UNP members of the Dambulla Pradeshiya Sabha at a mass celebration held at Dambulla town to coincide with the oath-taking ceremony of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe yesterday.
Wijeratne said President Maithripala Sirisena had taken a correct and bold decision in the countrys interests by appointing Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister again.
He said now the UNP had a great responsibility to appoint an efficient Cabinet of Ministers which would work genuinely for the common good without including individuals liable to cross over and change sides every now and then, he said.

Seed Bombs to increase forest cover
Sri Lanka Air Force undertook a unique mission to drop Seed Bombs in a forest reserve in the North Central region during an aerial operation on Wednesday (December 12). According to Air Force media, this operation was launched as a part of an ambitious project to restore and increase the forest cover of the country.
An Air Force Mi 17 Helicopter was utilized to drop approximately 5,000 Seed Bombs over a five-acre land patch in the Ranorawa forest in Nochchiyagama. This project is a joint effort between the SLAF Command Agro Unit, the University of Peradeniya and, MAS Holdings.
The project aims to increase the forest cover of the country from the present 27% to 32% to achieve sustainable development goals by 2030. These Seed Bombs included several varieties of trees like Karanda, Mee and Kumbuk and were made up of 48 different treatments/media compositions which would assist the germination and growth of the embedded seed after being scattered on the forest floor from air.
How Thailand is bombing seeds from planes to grow back its forests
In July 2013, Thailand began a five-year pilot project that utilised the aerial reforestation method to boost forest regeneration. Seeds from local plants including phayungs, makamongs and kaboks were dropped with the aim of regenerating a wildlife sanctuary in Phitsanulok province, transforming it into a healthy, green forest by 2017.
The idea of seed bombing first germinated in Japan with the ancient practice of tsuchidango or earth dumpling. In the 20th century, Masanobu Fukuoka, an advocate of Do Nothing Farming, popularised the idea. The earliest known record of seed bombing goes back to 1930, when planes were used to reforest certain areas in the mountains of Honolulu.
But the idea to adopt the seed farming on an industrial scale, to repopulate vast areas with trees, didnt get the required attention until 1999, when the US manufacturer Lockheed Martin Aerospace planned to plant 900,000 young trees in a day. Their plan to use huge C-130 transport aircraft, normally used by the military for laying carpets of landmines across combat zones, was considered for Scotland  at half the cost of manual methods.
Re-planting a forest, one drone at a time
In the near future it could be a small fleet of drones, coming to replant and restore forests that have been stripped of trees by industrial-scale deforestation.
Its all part of an ambitious plan by BioCarbon Engineering, a U.K.-based startup on a global mission to battle widespread clear-cutting, which strips more than 26 billion trees off the planet each year. CEO Lauren Fletcher, who spent 20 years as an engineer with NASA, says the only way to fight industrial-scale deforestation is with industrial-scale reforestation. Their idea: plant one billion trees a year. The first targets are in South Africa and the Amazonian jungles, both of which have suffered from widespread forest eradication.
BioCarbons reforestation scheme is simple and efficient. Heres a quick look at how it plans to deploy its drone fleet:
1. Do a 3-D aerial survey. First, drones are sent to fly over a potential planting zone, snapping photos that create 3-D maps of the area to be reforested. The number of drones will vary depending up on the size of the seeding.
2. Create a seeding plan. Once all that terrain data has been analyzed, it then generates a seeding pattern that best suits the terrain.
3. Load the seed pods. The drones, which are equipped with guidance and control software, carry pressurized canisters of seed pods with germinated seeds immersed in a nutrient-rich gel.
4. Hover and plant. Flying at a height of 1 or 2 metres, the drones follow the planting patterns, firing the biodegradable seed pods down to the ground. The pods break open upon impact, allowing the germinated seed a chance to take root.
5. Monitor growth. After planting, the drones do low-level flights to assess the health of the sprouts and saplings.
Such precision forestry, as BioCarbon calls it, is extremely efficient. A farmer might hand plant as many as 3,000 seeds a day; Fletcher says his drones can drop up to 36,000 seed pods daily, often in areas where a human cant reach. Working with local ecologists, BioCarbon will use the drones to spread a variety of tree species, as well as microorganisms and fungi designed to improve the soil quality. The central focus is ecosystem restoration, Fletcher says.
Fletcher sees the drones, which are commercially built by companies like Vulcan UAV and then modified, as an important way for existing reforesting organisations to expand their approach. There are some times when planting by hand is absolutely the right approach, he says. But, in other instances, the drones can be a very effective tool for the right location at the right time.
The full implementation will have a team of two operators running seven or eight drones simultaneously. Planting at about 10 pods per minute will equate to roughly 36,000 trees per day for each team. With 100 two-member teamsBioCarbons goal in the next 5-7 yearsit expects to plant one billion trees a year over roughly 500,000 hectares.
BioCarbon has funding from the Skoll Foundation and recently was featured in Drones for Good competition in the United Arab Emirates. It plans to begin field testing by September, and its efforts cant come fast enough. A new study published by the American Geophysical Union (AGU) says that the rate of tropical deforestation has risen by 62 percent between the 1990s and 2000s. One reason is that tropical deforestation has become more devastatingly efficient, notes geographer Douglas Morton of NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center. In the 60s, it was axes; in the 70s, chainsaws; and in the 2000s, it was tractors.

The Supreme Court ruling that the gazette notification dissolving parliament is null and void should be hailed as a correct decision by all, Ratnapura Deputy Mayor Lakshman Munasinghe said. Munasinghe was speaking to the media after the Supreme Court decision was delivered on December 15.
Munasinghe said the lawful government led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe elected by the People's mandate was in office until October 26, but the President changed it unconstitutionally.
The country's economy suffered a setback leading to anarchy with the President's autocratic action.
Past events clearly proved that any government elected democratically by the people should act in accordance with the provisions of the countrys constitution, he said.

UPFA will get Opposition Leaders post
The UPFA will be given the Opposition Leaders post if its entire membership sits in the Opposition ranks in Parliament. Mahinda Rajapaksa has not voted against any proposal brought in Parliament by Ranil Wickremesinghe. Neither did Mahinda Rajapaksa place his signature for the no-confidence motion brought against Ranil Wickremesinghe, JVPs Kalutara district Parliamentarian Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said.
He was speaking at an awareness programme attended by JVP activists in Kalutara yesterday.
Dr. Jayatissa said in the event the Opposition Leaders post was given to the UPFA, the most suitable person to hold that post would be Kumara Welgama because he was the person who said that they should sit in the Opposition without trying to tie up with others to form a coalition or national government. Welgama opposed the assumption of the Prime Ministers post through the backdoor.
He also opposed all action taken by Ranil Wickremesinghe. Welgama played his cards close to his chest and acted with great foresight and he is the most suitable person to hold the Opposition Leaders post, he said.
Dr. Jayatissa said the 50-day political conspiracy had how been busted. The Joint Opposition held protest demonstrations against Karu Jayasuriya for his failure to accept Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister. Would the Joint Opposition do the same against the judges who ruled against them during the recent petitions, was a question which begged an answer, he said. Dr. Jayatissa said the Joint Opposition also claimed that the LTTE would raise its head again the moment Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned from the Prime Ministers post. If that argument was valid, it proved that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had failed to annihilate the LTTE as boasted by him.
This would make one suspect whether the LTTE tigers were being kept caged at Medamulana and Wijerama Mawatha to be let loose whenever they wanted to, Dr. Jayatissa said.
He said if Ranil Wickremesinghe had any concern for the sacrifices made by the people to make democracy victorious, he should expedite action to penalise the rogues of the Rajapaksa regime without delay.
He alleged that the Ranil-Sagala clique had pampered corrupt individuals of the Rajapaksa regime without taking concrete action against them. Their plan would have been to divide the SLFP and disintegrate it in order to profit by it, Dr. Jayatissa said. As a result of their failure to net the rogues of the Rajapaksa regime, the rogues took hold of the government and executed a 50-day conspiracy, he said.
Dr. Jayatissa said both President Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe should be held responsible for the failure to honour the mandate given by 6.2 million people. He would challenge Ranil Wickremesinghe to set up two more special high courts before January 1 and expedite the high-profile cases against the rogues of the Rajapaksa regime.
Dr. Jayatissa said they were confident that Ranil Wickremesinghe would not act against members of the Rajapaksa family and his own acolytes. He said Mahinda Rajapksa may have relinquished his Prime Ministers post on an assurance that no legal action would be taken against him regarding alleged corruption cases.
Perhaps that may be a bonus paid to Rajapaksa for allowing Wickremesinghe to stay put at Temple Trees, even without holding the Prime Ministers post, he said.
Dr. Jayatissa said there were allegations that Sajith Premadasa had spent more than Rs. 300 million of state funds on publicity when he was Housing and Construction Minister.
He said there was no difference between the scenes created by UPFA thugs at Rupavahini and UNP thugs at Lake House following court rulings. How could Mahinda and Ranil discipline the nation when they could not discipline their own followers, he asked.
The resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa from the post of Prime Minister which was not in force was hilarious. He signed the document amidst the chanting of pirith and drumbeats while his supporters applauded. This reminded us of folklore relating to sour grapes heard during Kindergarten days.

$27,000 Game of Thrones cake
Tyrion Lannister isnt just one of the most beloved characters on HBOs hit series Game of Thrones, he is also the inspiration behind one of the most expensive cakes ever made  a 70-pound work of art showing the Halfman sitting on the Iron Throne.
The Broadway Bakery, in Dubai, recently celebrated the new season of Game of Thrones by creating an incredibly detailed cake featuring everyones favorite imp, Tyrion Lannister. Made primarily of sugar paste and fondant, the edible masterpiece stands four feet tall and weighs a whopping 70 pounds, making it large enough to feed a crowd of 100  120 people. But who, apart from his sister Cersei, would have the heart to take a knife to this realistic model of Tyrion
All the edible swords that make up the Iron Throne had to be shaped and painted individually, before assembling the iconic chair, and Tyrion himself took even more work. The artists in charge of the project tried to get the tiniest details, down to his stubble and facial scars, just right. All in all, it took 2 expert cake artists accompanied by a team of 18 talented chefs working over a period of three weeks to finish the cake.
The sugar paste and fondant were covered in 15 kg of the finest Belgian chocolate, and the gold goblet in Tyrions hand, as well as the artistic motif on his shirt were actually painted in 28 grams of edible gold. This raised the cost of the cake to a staggering 91,800 dirham ($27,000).
This epic four-foot high cake is a majestic tribute to the legendary Tyrion Lannister  the rightful King of the Seven Kingdoms, the Dubai bakery wrote.
The photos shared by Broadway Bakery dont really do this edible masterpiece justice, but luckily, they also posted a video detailing the work that went into making it from scratch.

Alvarez overwhelms Fielding to win supermiddlweight title
NEW YORK : Mexican superstar Saul Canelo Alvarez brutally overpowered Englands Rocky Fielding with a dominant display on his New York City debut Saturday to become a three-weight world champion.
Alvarez, who is the reigning World Boxing Council and World Boxing Association middleweight world champion following his thrilling victory over Gennady Golovkin in September, had little trouble in moving up in weight class and defeating Fielding, who held a second tier version of the WBAs super-middleweight title.
Alvarez sent Fielding to the canvas in the very first round with a crunching body shot and remained in complete control. He delivered a similar punch in the second which was also too much for the Englishman to take before the fight was stopped towards the end of the third following two further knock-downs.
I thought he would use his distance but luckily he didnt, Alvarez said in the ring after becoming the ninth Mexican fighter to be a champion in three different weight divisions.
He came to attack and I did my thing. The plan was to hit the body. That was the result. It was, ultimately, a total mismatch. Fielding just didnt have the power to compete, and when he went down twice in the third, referee Ricky Gonzalez correctly stopped the fight with 22 seconds left of the round.
It was a brave effort from the 31-year-old from Liverpool, who deserves great credit for accepting the task of entering the ring against the brilliant flame-haired Mexican, who extended his record to 51-1-2 with 35 knockouts in his first appearance since signing a record-breaking 11-fight, $365 million contract with sports streaming service DAZN.
This was Alvarezs first bout at super-middleweight. He fought Julio Chavez junior at a 164-pound catch-weight in a non-title match-up in 2017, and although he is set to move back down to 160 pounds for his next fight in 2019, his performance in front of a sold-out Madison Square Garden crowd was evidence of his ability to perform whatever the weight class.
I felt good and strong. I want the best fights, and to make sure my name is held up high, Alvarez said.
Fielding, coming into the bout with just one defeat from 28, had won his previous six fights, including a memorable victory over Germanys Tyron Zeuge in July which brought him world title glory.
Yet the proud and rangy Liverpudlian, who possessed a five-inch height and reach advantage, was unable to cope with his opponents supreme speed and punch power.
Fighting in the famed New York City arena for the first time in front of a vocal pro-Mexican crowd, Alvarez didnt disappoint.
The 28-year-old wasted no time in making his mark and when Fielding fell to his knees following a left to the body in the first there only looked like being one winner. Fielding enjoyed some success but wasnt using his height to his advantage. Alvarez soaked everything up before sending his opponent down once more in the second with another crunching blow to the ribs.
Towards the end of the third, Fielding was back on his knees and when he returned there once again soon after there was no way back as crowd of 20,112 roared its approval.
The Mexican, competing in his second fight since completing a six-month ban for testing positive for a banned substance in March, has vowed to drop back down to middleweight next year, which could see a potential third fight with Golovkin become an exciting reality.
I felt that it (his rivalry with Golovkin) ended on September 15 and I showed that I was best, Alvarez said.
But they were two great fights thats no secret, and if the people want it, we can make it. On the undercard, Irelands Katie Taylor, the IBF and WBA lightweight champion, moved to 12-0 after winning on points against Finlands Eva Wahlstrom who suffered her first defeat. AFP

## Title: Alzheimers IS linked to blood transfusions

Alzheimers IS linked to blood transfusions
A now-banned type of blood transfusion which was used globally until the 1980s may have given people Alzheimer's, a new study claims.
Between 1958 and 1985, abnormally short children in the US and the UK were given hormones harvested from cadavers to help spur their growth. But in the early 1980s, there was a global outbreak of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a fatal neurological disorder - and it was traced back to the blood transfusions.
The technique was banned in 1985, replaced with synthetic hormones, and researchers have been monitoring the survivors for other side effects ever since.
Now, a paper published today in the journal Springer presents new evidence for a popular theory that the technique created build-ups of amyloid protein in survivors' brains - paving the way to Alzheimer's.
The research team gave the hormones to mice, and the rodents developed signs of the disease within a year. The study, published in Nature, was carried out by University College London and led by Dr John Collinge, a professor of neurology at the UCL Institute of Prion Diseases.
The researchers drew one of their 2015 studies, which analysed the autopsied brains of eight people who died young from CJD. The disease is thought to occur when high levels of prions - known as 'amyloid seeds' - cause irreversible damage to nerve cells. More than 200 people worldwide died of CJD as a result of hormone transfusions.
All of the patients had been treated as children in the 1980s with a human growth hormone taken from cadavers. This procedure was first carried out in the UK in 1958, and in the US in 1963.
Although none of them developed the 'full picture' of dementia, six of them had worrying amounts of the naturally-occurring amyloid proteins in their brains.
In an Alzheimer's patient's brain, abnormal levels of amyloids clump together to form plaques that collect between nerve cells and disrupt their function.
Six of the brains also had some degree of of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which occurs when amyloids build in the brain's blood vessels and can cause bleeding. CAA is seen to some extent in nearly all Alzheimer's patients.
To build on this research, the scientists tracked down some of the batches of the human growth hormone that the deceased had been treated with.
Testing these samples revealed that some contained significant levels of both amyloid and tau proteins. Tau has been shown to form tangles in the area of the brain associated with memory loss in Alzheimer's sufferers.
The samples were then injected into mice who were genetically at-risk of developing the amyloid clumps seen in Alzheimer's. Other rodents were injected with brain tissue from known dementia patients.
The mice that were injected with the now-banned growth hormones showed clear signs of amyloid clumping along blood vessels in their brains and developed CAA within a year.
This occurred to a greater extent among the rodents who were injected with tissue from Alzheimer's patients. The study therefore suggests that human-growth hormone batches that have been stored for decades can still cause worrying amyloid clumps in mice.
'We have now provided experimental evidence to support our hypothesis that amyloid pathology can be transmitted to people from contaminated materials,' Professor Collinge said.
'We cannot yet confirm whether medical or surgical procedures have ever caused Alzheimers disease itself in people, or how common it might be to acquire amyloid pathology in this way.'
'It will be important to review risks of transmission of amyloid pathology by other medical procedures still done today, including instruments used in brain surgery, drawing on other research and what we already know about accidental CJD transmission.'
'This study did not look at surgical instruments at all, so we cant make any conclusions about that and any suggested implications about that are speculation beyond the scope of this work.'

Australia battle in Perth to build lead of 175 over India
Perth, Sunday: Australia's batsmen battled a deteriorating pitch in their bid to build a match-winning lead on the third day of the second Test in Perth on Sunday.
The hosts led by 43 after both teams' first innings despite a superb Virat Kohli century, but found batting incredibly tough in their second innings.
At stumps, Australia were 132 for four, with Usman Khawaja on 41 and Tim Paine on eight, an overall lead of 175.
Although they still had six wickets in hand, opener Aaron Finch was taken to hospital for scans after retiring hurt with an injured right hand on 25. The Australians played and missed time and again as they battled to extend their lead, with Jasprit Bumrah (1-25) almost unplayable at times and well supported by India's three other pacemen as they maintained unrelenting pressure on the batsmen.
Shaun Marsh (5) and Peter Handscomb (13) again fell cheaply, doing little to ease the pressure on their pair to retain their spots in the side.
In reply to Australia's 326 after winning the toss and batting, India were bowled out for 283 despite Kohli's 123. Kohli reached his century with a classic straight drive off paceman Mitchell Starc, having been at the crease for 310 minutes and faced 214 balls. Two overs later he produced the shot of the match when he lifted Josh Hazlewood over third man for six. - AFP

Crafting tasteful moments for kids
Children between the ages of 8 and 13 put on their aprons, as Mas Kitchen hosted their Christmas ginger bread event at their Food Studio in Thimbirigasyaya on December 8. The Mas Kitchen cooking events are a fun way for kids to flex their creative muscles, spend time working in teams, and best of all: a great way to introduce them to the joy of baking especially during the festive season.
There was so much excitement as the kids rolled-out their gingerbread dough. We believe that its important to encourage children to experiment with cooking at a young age. Especially during family holidays its important to make them feel part of the occasion. Getting involved in cooking allows them to not only learn about the different ingredients and how they blend together, its about harnessing imagination and their creativity, said MAs Kitchen Communications Manager, Sarah De Alwis. Cooking teaches kids valuable skills that they can carry with them through life. The kids cooking events are organised by Mas Kitchen, with the hope to give kids the chance to learn and improve their skills.
