Wolbachia to be introduced to control dengue
An agreement was signed between Sri Lanka and Australia to introduce Wolbachia bacteria to Sri Lanka to control dengue, Health Ministry spokesman said.
Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa signed the agreement on behalf of the Sri Lankan Government, while Australian Ambassador Bryce Hutchesson signed on behalf of the Australian Government. The project will cost Rs. 120 million.
The Monash University of Australia will provide technical assistance to carry out field studies in selected areas in Sri Lanka to use Wolbachia bacteria. Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil and Colombia successfully use Wolbachia infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to control dengue, he said.
Wolbachia bacteria live in bodies of over 60 insects including mosquitoes. When dengue mosquitoes were infected with Wolbachia bacteria, the virus does not develop inside their bodies up to the level of spreading it out.
Last year, 177,000 dengue patients and 400 dengue deaths were reported. This year so far 8,060 dengue patients and five deaths were reported, he said.

Preserve Buddhist heritage while respecting other religions
Colombo Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith called on all Sri Lankans to preserve Buddhist heritage, while respecting the religious beliefs of others.
He made these remarks yesterday at thecremation ceremony of Ven. Prof. Dr. Bellanwila Wimalaratana Nayake Thera at the Sri Jayewardenepura University grounds.
Cardinal Ranjith said he was talking to Ven. Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera recently about maintaining peace and harmony between religious communities and discussed the need to preserve Sri Lankan heritage.
"We had seen a decline in people professing religious beliefs and he was worried about it. He asked me what needs to be done to secure our heritage. Because in Sri Lanka, neo-liberal views are spreading rapidly, while religious beliefs are considered less important. He was concerned about the increasing secularisation in our society," he said.
The cardinal pointed out that it is important to realise that without religion, moral and ethical principles, a society cannot stand and appealed to the President and authorities to preserve our heritage.
He said our heritage and religious beliefs need to be protected for the betterment of the country.
Cardinal Ranjith said they have requested political leaders and relevant authorities to ban tuition classes on Sundays and Poya days, to allow the children to attend religious schools.
"The request was not about banning tuition classes, but creating a conducive environment for children to engage in religious activities," he said.

Three persons die of oral cancer daily
Three Sri Lankans die of oral cancer daily and consuming arecanuts such as varieties, babul, beeda and pampara has increased among schoolchildren and youth, Consultant Oncologists and Consultant Oral and Maxillo-facial surgeons said.
They were addressing a media seminar held at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday.
Annually around 2,500 oral cancer patients are detected from Sri Lanka and it is the most common cancer among Sri Lankan males, he said.
Thirteen percent of cancer patients suffer from oral cancer and the risk of developing oral cancer is 60 times high among the persons who chew betel with areca-nut and tobacco.
A new deheth wattiya was introduced without areca-nut, tobacco and lime but not even 50 percent of the users have that healthy product, they said.
Some are reluctant to accept that areca-nut and tobacco cause oral cancers. In every six second, one dies due to the use of tobacco, they said.

In his explanation, Brigadier Fernando had said he had not intended the gesture as a threat to the Tamil Diaspora protestors, but instead it was to indicate that Sri Lanka had ended the war against the terrorist leader. He had said he had not meant his action as a threat.
The protesters had been shouting slogans that Prabhakaran was their leader.
Brigadier Priyanka Fernando will continue in his capacity as the Minister Counsellor (Defence) at the Sri Lanka High Commission in London, having resolved the issue.

Agrahara policy holders to benefit from  Lanka Hospitals affordable flat rates
Lanka Hospitals PLC, is offering a special fixed rates for Cardiac Bypass Surgeries for the first time in Sri Lanka.
In collaboration with the National Insurance Trust Funds (NITF) Agrahara Insurance scheme, which exclusively caters to the government employees in Sri Lanka, Lanka Hospitals will be facilitating affordable flat rates for Agrahara beneficiaries for all Cardiac surgeries.
The Heart Bypass surgery and PTCA (Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty) are generally costly procedures offered by private health care providers. Bypass surgeries are of two types, normal risk and high risk where the latter costs significantly higher than the former.
The risk is pre-diagnosed and accordingly the rates are determined for the surgical procedures. Those unable to meet high surgical budget are compelled to remain in long waiting lists in government hospitals pending surgery.
As a step to alleviate the congestion in the government hospitals, the government has taken steps to offer Agrahara Policy through the NITF, which facilitates the government employees to seek medical attention from private medical institutions without having to wait in the list. Accordingly, Lanka Hospitals took a historic step by being the first hospital in the country to offer special fixed rates for all Cardiac Care packages for the public sector employees.
Housed within the Lanka Hospitals is a fully fledged dedicated Heart Centre, which caters to most comprehensive cardiac and cardiothoracic surgical procedures. The Heart Centre provides best medical expertise for effective treatment topped with unmatched aftercare for conveniently affordable rates.
Lanka Hospitals is the first of its kind to partner with the NITF 8 years ago to offer Agrahara insurance policy for the benefits of government employees. As a government preferred medical institution, Lanka Hospitals has facilitated a host of medical packages to Agrahara beneficiaries, which includes the recent move to provide LASIK and Cataract surgeries to the public sector, for the first time in Sri Lanka.

All's well that ends well
President Maithripala Sirisena acted prudently by rescinding the decision taken by the Foreign Ministry to suspend the services of Brigadier Priyankara Fernando from his post of Minister Councillor (Defence), attached to the Sri Lanka High Commissioner in London, after a video circulating on social media showed the latter making threatening gestures to a group of pro-LTTE protesters opposite the High Commission, on Independence Day. The group, calling itself Tamil Solidarity, had complained to the UK government, calling for the expulsion from Britain of Brigadier Fernando for his alleged uncalled for conduct. According to reports, the President has reacted angrily at the Foreign Ministry decision made without consulting him. It is the President who sanctions all diplomatic appointments and the FM decision should have been communicated to him so that he could have weighed the pros and cons of the decision, especially during an election time. In any event, the Brigadier's so called threatening gesture, was quite innocuous that did not warrant punitive action, going by the video footage shown on TV. He was later seen interacting with protesters in a friendly manner, though, was at the receiving end of some angry outbursts.
Of course, the Foreign Ministry decision may have been based on protocol. Diplomatic staff are supposed to conduct themselves according to laid down guidelines, dictated by the nature of the office they hold. Any departure from this carries with it certain consequences. It is difficult to say if the Brigadier's conduct conformed to the niceties expected of a member of diplomatic staff. Obviously, the Foreign Ministry decided otherwise. This is all the more reason that such posts should be manned by professionals. A member of the diplomatic staff should not let his/her emotions get the better of him/her.
This was not the first time that pro-LTTE protesters have held demos opposite the Sri Lanka High Commission, in London, all of which ended without incident. Not just the HC, even Lankan leaders who visited Britain were not spared. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was given a torrid time during one of his visits, which culminated in a schedule lecture, at the prestigious Oxford Union, having to be cancelled at the eleventh hour, after Tiger elements in London staged a massive protest against the visit. Hence, it is a fact that Sri Lankan leaders and envoys in Britain, and, elsewhere in Europe, too, will have to live with this reality, where they will be in for hostile receptions from Tamil diaspora groups, which have a significant presence in the west.
Be that as it may, the Joint Opposition lost no time in seizing upon the London incident, in order to make political capital, while the country was on the cusp of an important election. Perhaps, in a last fling of the dice, JO worthies paraded a group of disabled soldiers on the street to take issue against the shabby treatment of one of their erstwhile colleague by the Yahapalanaya government. Acting with lightening speed, to beat the deadline set for electioneering, the JO also organised a press conference, lining up all tried and tested individuals, who are masters in the art of bellowing nationalist rhetoric, only to be made to eat humble pie, in the middle of the grand show, when it was announced that the decision to suspend Brigadier Fernando had already been rescinded by the President. According to the JO, this was yet another example of insulting the ranaviruvas. Mahinda Rajapaksa too joined the party, making the most of the incident, at an election rally.
In their eagerness to shamelessly pounce on this morsel to garner votes in the south, the JO worthies had completely blinded themselves to the fact that it was Mahinda Rajapaksa who committed the worst insult to the security forces by throwing behind bars the war winning army commander. Not only that, a hunt was launched on those ranaviruvas who were suspected allies of Sarath Fonseka, forcing them to flee the country, one of them being the present army commander.
Thankfully, election activity is put on hold, preventing the pro-Rajapaksa saffron brigade taking to the streets, to weep buckets for the victimized Brigadier, who, like all other members of the security forces, could do no wrong , and, should not be taken before the law, at least in their book.
Arthika Gathakaya
Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe has said the main reason for the breakdown in fiscal discipline in the past was due to the President taking over the Finance Ministry. He was, of course, referring to Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was Finance Minster during his entire ten year term as President. Going further, the AG said this (Rajapaksa being President cum Finance Minister) caused the Finance Ministry Secretary to lose his head, where fiscal regulations were treated in cavalier fashion. Not only that, he (Secretary) did not give a damn for any minister (in the Rajapaksa Cabinet). Perhaps, this may be the reason for Wimal Weerawasnsa to call the then Finance Ministry Secretary arthika gathakaya (assassin of the economy). But, Rajapaksa cared not a whit. Even when Sarath Silva passed strictures that he (Secretary) should not be placed in positions of responsibility.

Asia stock markets drop sharply after US falls

Major Asian markets suffered sharp losses on Friday, following another day of steep falls on Wall Street.
In a volatile week for global investors, Japan's Nikkei 225 index slid 2.7% during early trading, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng tumbled 3.6%. Earlier, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,000 points for the second time this week.
Sell-offs around the world have been pinned partly on concerns over higher interest rates.
Elsewhere in Asia on Friday, South Korea's Kospi index traded down 1.7% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.4%.
Those losses came as little surprise, with moves in major US markets providing the cue for global investors.
On Thursday, Dow Jones ended 4.2% lower at 23,860, the S&P 500 closed down 3.8%, while the Nasdaq sank 3.9%.
European exchanges also headed south on Thursday.
Rate rises imminent 
Investors have begun to worry that inflation might rise more quickly than expected, leading policymakers to raise rates, prompting a pull-back from stocks.
On Thursday, the Bank of England seemed to offer support for that view.
The bank left interest rates at 0.5% at its meeting, but said a strengthening economy meant interest rates were likely to rise sooner than the markets were expecting.
Also worrying investors was a government budget proposal announced by US lawmakers, which raises spending caps and could fan inflation.
Bond yields in the US have also risen in recent weeks, typically a signal of higher rates.
Higher interest rates push up borrowing costs for companies and individuals, which can hurt corporate profits and curb economic activity.
At the same time, higher interest rates can make investment alternatives to stocks, such as bonds, more attractive.
Shifting conditions The uptick in volatility comes as investors react to the shifting conditions.
Thursday's declines mean the Dow and S&P 500 have now fallen by more than 10% from the record highs set in January, a threshold analysts call a correction.
Shares in financial, technology and consumer companies led the declines on Thursday, which infected every sector.
American Express and Intel were the two biggest losers on the Dow. Analysts, who have said for months that the financial markets were due a correction after a long period of rising prices, urged calm.
"The latest decline takes us back to where we were 17 November," said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, which tracks interest rates.
"We've just given back some recent gains, not wiped out anyone's life savings."

Significantly the customer will get a single bill for all subscribed services under the present billing relationship, with the customer having the facility to pay for subscription via the Payment Gateway.

They can streamline their finance, inventory management, sales and customer relation management easily and save costs and be more profitable.
M.I. Deen, General Manager, Enterprise Solution of SLT said, The primary importance of software as a Service (SAAS) and a software delivery mechanism is the fact that it shifts enterprise focus from deploying and supporting software applications to using the applications as-a-service to extract strategic value to the company. Deploying complex enterprise software such as ERP and CRM applications require a significant investment in physical infrastructure, licensing costs, as well as a large team of skilled IT personnel to integrate the software with existing systems and data. This results in a financial burden to the enterprises activities which are not core to the enterprise businesses. With Akaza ERP, this problem is alleviated as SLT in conjunction with Bileeta will look at the customer requirements holistically from design, migration, deployment, integration, maintenance stages in the Cloud ERP initiative.

Bitcoins wild price ride
Bitcoin has lost more than 50 percent of its value since mid-December sliding amid escalating regulatory threats, international banks blocking crypto purchases, and fears of fraud and hacking.
Bitcoins price has been on a wild ride, from about $1,000 this time last year, shooting up to over $19,000 before dropping down to its current value of around $8,000.
Bitcoin is the most prominent cryptocurrency, but there are more than 1,500 others out there. Startups offer new coins, or tokens, in events known as ICOs, or initial coin offerings. But beware, between 14 to 30 percent of ICOs are fraudulent, according to Christian Catalini, an assistant professor at MIT Sloan School of Management who studies cryptocurrencies.
On January 30, Facebook announced that it would not allow ads that peddle ICOs or cryptocurrencies to block scammers and fraudsters.
In the U.S., Citigroup, Bank of America, and JP Morgan Chase have stopped people purchasing cryptocurrency with a credit card, while in the UK, Lloyds Banking Group and Virgin Money have followed suit.
Meanwhile, China has reportedly blocked anyone in the country from accessing websites that offer cryptocurrency trades or ICOs. Graphic News

I recently visited the Port City, one among many initiatives that the Sri Lankan Government is pushing forward that demonstrates its commitment to creating the right conditions for economic growth.
Port City will provide a range of opportunities for UK-based professional services to work with Sri Lankan partners to take forward our shared ambitions to develop international business.

CDM students receive recognition at SLIM
The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), a renowned National Marketing body for Marketing with nearly 50 years of experience is setting the precedent for Marketing education in the country.
SLIM recognizes the necessity for future Digital Marketers to hone their skills and take on the future with confidence and as a result introduced an innovative programme to their extensive educational portfolio this year, known as the Certificate in Digital Marketing (CDM).
The first intake of the inaugural CDM Batch completed the programme and was recognised for their efforts at the SLIM Certification Ceremony held recently.
Digital Marketing is also known as the marketing of products or services using digital media and technologies, mainly on the Internet, but also including mobile phones, display advertising, and any other digital medium.
This branch of Marketing, which promotes products or brands via digital media, differs from traditional Marketing as it involves the use of channels and methods which enable an organization to analyse Marketing campaigns and understand what works and what doesnt for each particular promotion. Digital Marketing facilitates customer relationships across all channels both digital and traditional, and is thus an integrated approach towards Marketing.
The Certificate in Digital Marketing (CDM) is a preliminary course designed by SLIM to help students understand the fundamentals and various aspects of Digital Marketing and the online communication ecosystem.
Students gain essential skills in planning, organizing, leading, controlling and decision-making within the innovative, three month-long programme which consists of five Modules. While 50% of the content emphasize on theoretical concepts, the remainder concentrate on professional practices with project-based learning opportunities.
The Certificate in Digital Marketing is delivered with a blended focus on academic and professional orientation.
Speaking at the ceremony, Pradeep Edward, Vice President of Education at SLIM said, We at SLIM introduced the Certificate in Digital Marketing programme after well-conducted market research, being aware of the massive demand in Digital Marketing at present, he stated. Students can be assured of guidance by well-qualified resource persons, including visiting lecturers who are practicing Digital Marketers, holding senior positions in top corporate industries who will provide insights on the big picture by using examples from the local and international arena.
Also commenting on the programme , Sanath Senanayake, SLIM CEO and Executive Director noted, I am positive that candidates even with preliminary Marketing know-how would be keen to gain Digital Marketing knowledge by following the CDM course. The Certificate in Digital Marketing by SLIM is going to be one of the most sought-after programmes in the island as time goes on. Our syllabus, textbooks and course content are prepared to suit current industry requirements, he concluded.

Ceylinco Life presents  Pranama schols to countrys brightest students
The power of recognition to inspire and motivate further achievement was the central theme when Ceylinco Life presented scholarships to another 168 young Sri Lankans at the 17th edition of the life insurance leaders Pranama scholarships programme recently.
High achieving schoolchildren from every district of Sri Lanka, their parents and teachers filled the main auditorium of the Nelum Pokuna theatre at a poignant felicitation of the future leaders of the country, at which Ceylinco Life presented more than Rs 11 million in new scholarships.
Children who excelled at the Year 5 scholarship examination, students that topped their districts at the GCE Ordinary Level examination, high achievers at the GCE Advanced Level examination and 13 young people that excelled at the national or international level in sports, culture, arts, drama or invention were among those honoured at the grand event.
It increased Ceylinco Lifes cumulative investment in rewarding academic and extra-curricular achievement through 17 years of the Pranama scholarships programme to Rs 131 million.
Addressing the event as Chief Guest, Professor Ajantha Dharmasiri, Chairman of the Board of Management of the Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM) of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura said that for the scholarship recipients, the event represented a consecration (Abhisheka) of their achievements, the pride (Abhimanaya) of being among the brightest students in the country and the challenge (Abhiyogaya) of living and learning from the womb to the tomb.
He said students seeking to take their rightful place as the future leaders of the country would need both competence and confidence to succeed.
Ceylinco Life Managing Director R. Renganathan emphasised that besides acquiring the knowledge they need through education, the students of today would have to learn to work with others as part of a team when they seek to meet the expectations of future employers, and that the leadership traits they would need should be learnt in school. Pointing out that knowledge alone would not be enough for success, he stressed the importance of engaging in extra-curricular activities while in school.
One of the highlights of the event was a speech made by Dr Anjali Pathirana, who had been a Pranama scholarship recipient in 2006 on how the scholarship inspired her to strive for greater achievement.
Adjudged Sri Lankas Best Life Insurer in 2017 for the fourth consecutive year by World Finance, Ceylinco Life has been market leader in Sri Lankas life insurance sector since 2004 and has close to a million lives covered by active policies. The company is acknowledged as the benchmark for innovation in the local insurance industry for its work in product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.

Ceylon Caf to introduce online booking and ordering
Located in the heart of Colombo's Cinnamon Gardens, the Ceylon Caf will soon introduce online booking and also ordering online, said its founder, Niranjan Deva Aditiya who is also a Member of the European Parliament.
He said that this is due to the high demand it is receiving from both local and foreign clientele.
The Grand Gourmet at Nirjs, Sri Lankas first French fine dining restaurant, (The Ceylon Caf) was opened by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Prof Maithree Wickremesinghe and since then saw several new additions to it.
While our intention with Grand Gourmet at Nirjs is simple, it is also boundless, in the sense that we want to achieve Michelin Star status and put Sri Lanka on the world gourmet map.
The finest ingredients are only part of the step  we want to provide an internationally recognised and immersive fine dining experience, Niranjan Deva Aditiya said. I have always had a passion for food, and it is through my association with the Nth Degree, and its Chairman Robert Walton MBE, that I have been able to immerse myself in the world of fine dining  to fully experience not only the best restaurants the world has to offer, but to also share the experience with top chefs and other food lovers.
Grand Gourmet at Nirjs will also be innovative and keep itself on the food industrys cutting edge by flying in leading chefs and currently an experienced French Chef is employed.
The interior takes us back in time to the Ceylon era, with a sociable neighborhood dining atmosphere, which offers seating for up to 50 guests and is available for lunch, dinner, private dining, or exclusive hire.
The venue also saw several former prime Ministers such as Tony Blair from UK, Prime Minister of New Zealand John Phillip, world fame billionaires and economics like George Soros and Prof Joseph Stiglitz and Ricardo Hausmann and VVIP's from all over the world dining in it.
Along with the Ceylonese traditional recipes, The Ceylon Cafs Executive Chef and his team have been experimenting the various cuisines and its origins to offer you a choice of three different options at any given meal.
He said that though the restaurant is located in Colombo 7 the prices are affordable and are four times cheaper than of a four star hotel. Due to this, one could even see University students at the restaurant, he said.
Talking about his future plans he said that he was overwhelmed by the response he received for his first venture and would open a second restaurant in Southern coastal belt. Once again I want to create a legacy and will be a glass bottomed venture where one would be able to see fish under the guests feet.
The aim of Grand Gourmet at Nirjs is to present fresh, local and seasonal produce in the best possible light while using the traditions of the French fine dining experience.
"Sri Lanka has an abundance of great produce - richly flavored and exotic ingredients and we use them to offer a fine dining experience".

Chinese yuan strengthens to  new high against USD
The central parity rate of the Chinese yuan hit a new high against the U.S. dollar Thursday, as the dollar weakened.
The yuan strengthened 60 basis points to 6.2822 against the U.S. dollar Thursday, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System, marking the highest level since Aug. 11, 2015.
The yuan's performance beat market expectations, reflecting the sound fundamentals of China's economy, said analysts.
The dollar index, measuring the U.S. currency against six other major currencies, fell 3.4 percent in January.
China's foreign exchange reserves rose for the 12th straight month to reach 3.16 trillion U.S. dollars at the end of January, official data showed Wednesday.
A statement from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange attributed the increase to stronger non-dollar currencies and higher asset prices. The administrators predicted a more balanced forex supply and demand, noting that the yuan's exchange rate would see more two-way movement.
In China's spot foreign exchange market, the yuan is allowed to rise or fall by 2 percent from the central parity rate each trading day.
The central parity rate of the yuan against the U.S. dollar is based on a weighted average of prices offered by market makers before the opening of the interbank market each business day. (Xinhua)

There are municipal public toilets located on two-perch lands inside the line Attay watta in Maligakanda road, Colombo 10, which is no more in use with the water supply being disconnected.
This place has become an eyesore with garbage strewn inside and outside. This is to suggest that Municipality should demolish these toilets immediately and make use of this space to put up a reading room/library for the use of the students residing in this garden. Or else plant trees and flowers to make garden more pleasing to the eye.
The Municipality can also look into other options to make use of this space such as to put a mini-childrens park or some other purpose which will bring benefits to the residents of the above garden.

The Cola Hand..!
A few months ago the rest of the world looked with startled surprise as India chastised, chastened and castigated Coke and Pepsi and blamed a lot of health problems on their youngsters imbibing the foreign sodas.
I dont understand why anybody should be surprised, chuckled a senior Indian bureaucrat as he sat with arms crossed across massive belly in his impressive office somewhere in New Delhi, For decades we have learnt the art of blaming a foreign hand for all our problems, and have becomes experts at doing so!
The bureaucrat called his bespectacled junior to his office, told him to bring a manual and beckoned him to sit down, Tell this journalist what we are supposed to do when a bomb blast occurs in Mumbai
Blame Pakistan! screamed his junior officer without opening his manual.
And if a rape takes place in Delhi
Blame the West for provocative movies! shouted the junior.
And if it takes place in Mumbai
In Mumbai, said his junior as he poured into his manual, found the page and then read out standard procedure is to immediately blame foreign organizers of beauty contest and fashion pageants for corrupting our youth!
In Chennai I asked.
Blame Cartoon Network! screamed the junior without opening his book.
The senior bureaucrat chuckled mirthlessly and grinned at his junior who grinned shyly back at him, it is because of this carefully prepared manual I can sit here and not have to run around searching for criminals and rapists!
But why this sudden attack on Coke and Pepsi I asked.
Standard procedure! whispered the junior and his boss beaked at him.
I dont understand, I said.
Let me put it this way, said his senior, suppose there is a bomb blast in India and we blame America, would you believe us I shook my head, so we have to blame somebody who we have already built up in your kind as evil, do you get the point
You mean Coke and Pepsi are being built as culprits for future use
You have all the makings of a good bureaucrat, said the senior bureaucrat as his junior looked sulkily at me but grinned when his boss turned to hm.
And what I asked, Will you blame them for later
Everything! screamed the junior and his boss reached across and patted him appreciatively.
Read out the list! said his boss.
Its exhaustive! said the junior, but it includes malnutrition, hepatitis, tuberculosis, typhoid, AIDS..
AIDS I asked incredulously.
Why not chuckled the senior bureaucrat, the UN has called India the AIDS capital of the world and we have to start blaming somebody for it!

Colombo will not sink due to Port City: Ranawaka
There fear that the Colombo city would face the threat of sinking due to the construction of the Colombo Port City is baseless, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
He said soon after the Good Governnace government was elected, the construction of the Colombo Port City was initiated following extensive research conducted on environmental factors and added that precautionary measures have already been taken to avert all probable risks.
He further said world-renowned experts are involved in the construction work, and therefore, nothing is to be feared.
Minister Ranawaka added that the construction of a 60-storeyed building would be completed by 2025. "The best answer we can give critics is to go to the 60th storey once the building is completed and see if Colombo would sink. This is an open challenge and I wish to mention the names of those who made bland criticisms on the project, on its opening day," he added.
The minister said his Ministry was ready to accept constructive criticism and added that it was unfair to mislead people by spreading false rumours.
"We have to accept that it would take a long time to yield the benefits of those projects," Minister Ranawaka said, "So everyone, including civil organisations, should be patient without making baseless allegations."
The Minister further said people would face difficulties when Colombo is being developed. He added that for example, due to the construction of the housing complex by the Public Administration Ministry, the residences of Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, and his own (Minister Ranawaka), were affected since all of them were living in the same neighbourhood and the complex was being constructed behind their residencies. "We all tolerate it, as the construction is being carried out for public servants," Minister Ranawaka said.

Council tax  hikes planned 'across England'
Nearly all local authorities in England are set to raise council tax and service charges amid concerns for their financial stability, a survey suggests.
Council tax is set to rise in 95% of authorities while 93% will hike service fees, according to the 2018 State of Local Government Finance research.
The planned increases come as 80% of councils fear for their balance sheets.Last week, Northamptonshire County Council banned all new spending and said its financial future was "grave".
Council tax can rise by 3% this year, in line with inflation, before a referendum is triggered, although the largest authorities are to be allowed to increase it by up to 5.99%.
Local authorities also oversee charges for services such as parking, burials and planning and 93% of respondents to the survey indicated new or increased fees in order to make ends meet. Central government funding has come under fire as a result, with councils said to be calling for a "fundamental redesign of the financial system". On Friday, it emerged Northamptonshire County Council had imposed emergency controls on its spending in order to address "severe financial challenges". The move, known as a section 114 notice, is issued when a council does not have enough money to meet its expenditure. It is the first local authority in 20 years to resort to the measure. (BBC)

CSE records strongest start to a year in 2018
Foreign investors indicated a renewed interest in Sri Lankan stocks in 2017 with record breaking purchases worth Rs 112 billion, and CSE has seen that momentum continue into 2018 as well, said Head of Market Development at Colombo Stock Exchange, (CSE) Niroshan Wijesundere.
The level of interest the CSE has seen within the very first month of the year is quite encouraging and indicates that Sri Lankan stocks remain attractive to foreign portfolio investors, especially those with investment interests in frontier markets.
What is particularly encouraging is that the level of foreign buying we have seen in 2017 and in the early parts of this year mark a sharp reversal from 2015/16, during which we saw significant fund outflows.
Present developments give us a reason to believe that Sri Lanka at the moment is viewed as a market with considerable growth potential, which is vindicated by the substantial level of foreign investor interest we have experienced in recent times, he said.
He attributed the attractive valuations with the market Price Earnings Ratio at 10.69 even at present, one of the lowest in the region as one of the key forces behind this success.
Encouraging performance among listed companies, an improving macroeconomic outlook and a strong value-driven investment case too have contributed to foreign investors placing their confidence in Sri Lankan Stocks, he said.
Positive developments such as noticeable improvements in the gross official reserves, flexible exchange rate management, a recovering balance of payments position, strong FDI numbers and fiscal consolidation have contributed to an improvement in the macro-economic outlook, which is certainly important when attempting to attract foreign investment to the market.
Sri Lanka was also recently mentioned on the Wall Street Journal as the most attractive frontier market in comparison with 11 other countries, according to a model presented by the Citi Bank.
Record breaking foreign investment in the Sri Lankan stock market has continued into 2018, with Rs 4 billion in net foreign purchases during the month of January, a new record for the first month of any given year.
The month recorded Rs 10.7 billion in foreign purchases in the market, while foreign investors made sales worth Rs. 6.7 billion, which has established a record breaking start to the year in terms of net foreign purchases. The Sri Lankan stock market has over the years been quite unique, in the sense that it has had a low correlation with developed and emerging markets and their trends.
There is a strong reason to believe that the Sri Lankan stock market is based on local driving forces and the performance of our listed entities, rather than global market related developments.Foreign inflows certainly do have a positive impact on the balance of payments as witnessed in 2017, which was also acknowledged by the Central Bank, he pointed out.
Increased international interest in the Stock Market would lead to a broader focus on the country as a whole, and would benefit the Sri Lankan economy and listed companies in their bid for growth.
A stock market that attracts foreign investors has the potential to be perceived as a sign of strength, and of a market-friendly environment, especially in the context of an emerging country like Sri Lanka.
Foreign investors have certainly been quick to move on the buying opportunity Sri Lankan stocks have presented since 2017and this makes a strong case for improved involvement among local institutional and individual investors as well. The opportunity has always been available for both local and foreign investors and is still on the table.
The onus is on the local investors to engage in the market and benefit from its value proposition. We as an exchange will work on creating the awareness on these opportunities both among existing and new local investor segments.

De Livera urges for interference-free NCPA
The National Child Protection Authority should be an independent body free of political interference, NCPA Chairperson Marini de Livera said in a statement on Thursday.
But at present, it has become evident that the NCPAs independence is being challenged by certain parties, she said.
NCPA sources told the Daily News that the Secretary of the Child Development and Women`s Affairs Ministry had allegedly called a board meeting without the Chairpersons knowledge.
They said only the Chairperson has the power to call for a board meeting.
When the National Child Protection Authority Act (of 1988) which established the NCPA was presented in Parliament, it was noted that it should function as an independent government body, Chairperson de Livera said in her statement.
Thus, I would like to state that I will not be participating in any illegal meeting held on the NCPA, and will undertake all activities in accordance with the law, she said.
I too commend highly President Maithripala Sirisenas campaign against corruption and as the Chairman of the NCPA, I have instituted the same programme under my purview, she added.

Death of Kallaru Tusker due to natural causes
The death of the elephant known as Kallaru Tusker had been due to natural causes and not due to a shooting incident near the Tantirimale border of the Wilpattu National Park as earlier suspected.
This was the ruling given by veterinary surgeon Dr. Taraka Prasad of the Wildlife Conservation Department who earlier conducted an on-the-spot investigation.
After the postmortem examination held at the Anuradhapura courts complex on February 6, Dr. Prasad also concluded that the pair of tusks seized by police and the tusker's head and bone parts also matched with each other. He said no gun shot wounds were found anywhere in the tusker's body.
Dr. Prasad said the tusker might have died abut two years ago due to some illness.
The earth under the tusker's carcass had heavily subsided suggesting that it had struggled before ultimately passing away. The earth would not have subsided if the tusker died instantly due to a shooting or electrocution due to lightning. Anuradhapura Police found the body parts of the tusker at Mollikulam, Naddukuttu in Silavatura on February 5.
Police believe that the three suspects, including a Moulavi now in remand for the possession of the tusker's tusks, would have removed them after finding the carcass during a visit to Wilpattu National Park.
Police had caught them while they were trying to sell the two tusks to a police decoy for Rs. 5 million. They were earlier produced in court and remanded till February 9.

Diaspora vital for development of Sri Lanka: Consul General in Frankfurt
An event to celebrate the 70th Anniversary of Independence of Sri Lanka, was held at the Sri Lanka Consulate premises on February 4, 2018, with the participation of a large number of Sri Lankans and friends of Sri Lanka in Frankfurt. More importantly, participation of the Tamil community in this event was very significant. The Consulate has been maintaining a good rapport with the Tamil Diaspora in Germany. To commence the proceedings of the day, Ambassador Ranjith Gunaratna, Consul General of Sri Lanka in Frankfurt, unfurled the national flag, which was followed by the singing of the National Anthem, lighting of the traditional oil lamp, religious observances, reading of the national day messages of the President and the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
The special guest speaker of the event, Professor Maithri Moorthi of the South Asian Institute of Heidelberg University addressed gathering recalling the struggle faced by Sri Lankans of all ethnic groups, to free the country from the clutches of the colonial powers. Making special reference to the 1818 revolt against the colonial powers, he elaborated the display of true valour by our national heroes. Professor Maithri Moorthi enlightened the audience with historical anecdotes related to the birth of a new nation in Sri Lanka with the arrival of Prince Vijaya with a group and people from various parts of India. Some similarities that could be found between the Sinhalese language and many other languages in India, including Tamil, Teligu, Oriys (main language in Orissa) and Malayalam, were also explained by stressing the fact that it was meaningless to create divisions in society based on languages. Instead, we should acknowledge the positive influence of various languages and cultures on Sri Lanka, he asserted. This would be significantly helpful in narrowing the gulf between the Sinhalese and the Tamils. Citing the Ramayana, he explained, that although Prince Rama depicted Sri Lanka as a golden Island, he opted to return to India after the great battle with King Ravana, as his motherland was the most precious place in the world for him. This concept was also applicable to Sri Lankans living abroad as well.
Ambassador Gunaratna, in his brief address to the gathering, emphasised the need for the Sri Lankan Diaspora to positively engage with their motherland. He further stated that Sri Lanka Diaspora is a strong body that could protect and promote the vital interests of Sri Lanka abroad. It was also their duty to effectively influence the happenings in Sri Lanka, accentuating the need for radical changes in some fields, especially science and technology.

Digital payments shaping future  of  E-Commerce in Sri Lanka
The payment ecosystem has been evolving rapidly, in the last few years with the surging shift towards digital payment options. This continuous growth in the entire global payments ecosystem has led to entrepreneurs and startups inventing new and innovative mechanisms to improve the way we move money in society.
Among the rising trends of the future of payments, digital wallets can be seen as the leading trend globally. DirectPay is a pioneer in building the digital payment ecosystem in Sri Lanka, working the required infrastructure with some of the leading local banks in the country.
DirectPay Founder and Chief Executive Kanishka Weeramunda said With the exponential growth of mobile payment transactions and the never-ending consumer hunger for online shopping, e-Commerce companies around the world are benefiting from Digital Payment mechanisms.
In Sri Lanka e-commerce giants like Takas, Wow and MogoSuper are starting to offer digital payment options as the primary methods of making payments. Many fashion stores on the outskirts of Colombo such as Molly Boulevardare going online to reach new customers beyond their city limits that has lead in achieving a visible difference in online sales compared to walk-in sales due to the widespread availability of digital payment options. This shows that consumers today need a payment platform that is both secure and simple to use. Therefore, going cashless has become a preferred choice more than a convenience for many.
Whats beyond
He further elaborated According to leading analyst reports mobile wallets could be the most significant transformation in payments processing. Retailers are especially excited about it as they can offer valuable insights about customer transactions and other useful data that companies can use to enhance the consumer experience.
The accuracy and speed of mobile payments can help increase foot traffic in stores, which in turn would generate more sales.
Research indicates that in-store mobile payment volume is expected to grow from $75 billion in 2015 to $503 billion in 2020 worldwide, a clear indication that the world is moving towards digital payment solutions and those who do not accommodate this shift will be left behind.
For millennials, whose prominence is increasing in the marketplace, digital payments have become common place. Therefore, its now on industry leaders to create action plans that keep up with the demands of the millennial purchaser. This doesnt mean thinking a couple of years out, but rather decades. Hence shopping trends are all pointing to m-commerce (mobile commerce) as the future wave for next-generation shoppers. 
Contributing to the country's digital payment ecosystem
Within this dynamic ecosystem, DirectPays long term vision is to empower local industries and consumers with the opportunity to embrace a cashless economy and to exercise their purchasing power with greater ease.
The company has been appointed to facilitate the eLocal government service payments launched early this year that has revolutionized the payment landscape in the public sector. Theyare also making waves amongst the SME retail space as well as with the leading retailers in the country that includes international franchise outlets.
Weeramunda said we are quietly optimistic of making the best of Sri Lankas growing mobile internet population to make them become savvy at digital payment. Going digital however cannot be a success, until rural parts of the country become active participants. This is why DirectPay are concentrating on rural segments of the retail industry and making them understand the value, convenience and cost effectiveness of the digital payment model. We are happy to be a key player helping the country, convert both retailers and consumers to consider digital payments as a preferred mode of transaction.
 With the number of mobile internet users in the country waiting to be snapped up, its time for Sri Lanka to be in sync with the global market by creating mobile-friendly payments that deliver a simple, secure experience which will convert and foster long-term loyalty amongst shoppers, concluded Weeramunda.

Disappearance of 11 youth: Defence wants CID out of probe
The Colombo Fort Magistrates Court yesterday fixed for February 22 to deliver its order regarding a request by the defence party requesting that investigations pertaining to former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P Dassanayake and nine others be transferred from the CID to any other police station.
In this case, former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P.Dassanayake and nine others are accused of aiding and abetting the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009.
Counsel Asith Siriwardena appearing for the suspects had made an application to change the investigative agency; namely, CID and transfer the investigation to any other Police Station.
Defence counsel submitted to court that there were contradictions in the statements recorded and the CID is acting partially against the Navy Officers.
Filing written submissions against defences request, counsel Achala Seneviratne appearing for the aggrieved party informed court that there is no ground to transfer the inquiry out of the CID. The Counsel for suspects did not rely on any provision of law to seek a transfer of the Investigative Agency by way of a Court Order. The Transfer Application is nothing but another kind of threat to scuttle the investigation.No legal system will accept a proposition that a suspect can choose or change the Investigative Agency. The Investigative Agency is aimed at collecting evidence for a prosecution.
There is no justification at all for the suspects under our law to seek an Order from Court to seek to change an Investigative Agency or the Investigators.There is no provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure authorising a magistrate to change the investigative agency, the aggrieved party said.
In her written submissions, counsel Achala Seneviratne stated that this case relates to abductions of several individuals, mainly schoolchildren by a group of Navy personnel. As the investigations commenced, almost nine years ago, the Police was confronted with obstructions, by various quarters, mainly by the Navy.
The written submissions further stated that the Navy continuously obstructed the investigations, but due to the professionalism and independence shown by the CID, the investigations progressed successfully.
The missing persons had been abducted by an unidentified group at Dehiwala, Battaramulla and Wattala in 2008 and 2009.

Dogs protect your heart
Scientists in Sweden have analyzed data from over three million people between the ages of 40 and 80 years old. This study, published in Scientific Reports Journal, attempted to find out if there was a relationship between dog ownership and mortality.
It also looked at the relationship between dog ownership and heart disease. Owning a dog was found to lower the chances of death from any cause.In single and multiple-person households, dog ownership was associated with lower risk of death. Owning a dog was also found to lower the risk of death from heart disease. Dog ownership was associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease death. For persons living alone, dog ownership was protective against heart disease. In single person households, dog ownership was inversely associated with cardiovascular outcomes. Another interesting finding was that certain types of dogs provided more protection against heart disease than others! Ownership of hunting breed dogs was associated with lowest risk of cardiovascular disease. The scientists concluded that owning a dog can be protective against heart disease and death from all causes. Dog ownership appears to be associated with lower risk of CVD in single-person households and lower mortality in the general population.
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the world. In Europe, where this study was conducted, over four million people died from heart disease 2016. Previous studies found that owning a dog was associated with relief from social isolation and offered an improved sense of general well-being.Dog ownership has been reported to be associated with alleviation of social isolation and improved perception of wellbeing, particularly in single persons and the elderly.
These effects would contribute to a lowering of psychological stress. Psychological stress is a major factor in most chronic diseases. As we get older, our capacity for recovery becomes impaired. Walking becomes an excellent form of healthy exercise. When people own dogs they are more active. Dogs need to be walked and people like to look after their dogs.A meta-analysis of eleven observational studies found that dog owners walked more and were more physically active than non-owners.
Remember that the study found that hunting dogs are more protective These dogs generally need more activity, and that may mean that their owners get more healthy low-level activity.
Daylight is of critical importance to human health  something many people dont realize. When the weather gets bad people tend to stay in  even more so when they are getting older. But dogs still need to be walked  and people tend to do more walking in bad weather when they have dogs.
Indeed, there are even studies showing that death from all causes increases in periods of low light. This includes nighttime and winter.Its possible that taking your dog for a walk could have some unexpected and powerful health benefits. Owning a dog lowers many of the risk factors for heart disease, as shown by previous studies. Dog ownership has been reported as inversely associated with the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes
In patients with diagnosed heart disorders, dog ownership is associated with better outcomes. In patients with coronary artery disease, dog ownership is reportedly associated with improved survival.
So it seems from this enormous library of data that owning a dog can protect your heart, improve your sense of well-being, and lower your risk of death.
Humans and dogs have lived and worked together for many thousands of years. This is a truly ancient human biohack! Dont replace professional medical advice with a dog, though  see a doctor about health problems. (IS)

Enjoy the orchestra of island tastes
Juliet Coombe takes a look at the magnificent menus of Jetwing Colombo 7 and Valentines Day picture post card views of Colombo city by night from the rooftop bar, that would seal the fate of any romantic date.
Jetwing Colombo Seven has, in just over a year, set lots of new Colombo food trends, including anticipating the fashionable growing love for sharing platters, which they introduced as a new concept in the Colombo city bar scene. This fine dining affordable bar food experience, complete with azure pool and panoramic views of the city, has brought people together in adventurous groups, to try a mixture of new things. One platter, for example, is a mix of food using different styles of cooking from frying to mixing ingredients with cream, which give an orchestra of tastes, whilst enjoying a cocktail or Colombo 7 gin and tonic. The most popular platter is smoked and cured meats from an exciting choice of nine platters, which mix hot and cold together to make each one sing a different song. They also serve up a mixed concept if you have a sweet tooth - They put chilli and chocolate together, which is a truly spicy experience in the Ward 7 bar, where you can always expect the unexpected and wow your date with the voodoo of the location and explosion of different tastes.
Jetwing Colombo 7, being a boutique concept, has also created a new style of lunch and dinner menu in an exciting magazine format to give the Colombo city history while you wait for each course to be served. It serves dishes that cater to different clients ranging from sugar-free desserts, as diabetes is a worldwide problem, to delicious cheesecake and watalappan, also available by swapping ingredients for healthier options. Another Colombo first is the Wasabi Caesar Salad, which is a clever twist on the original American version. Being in the centre of the world, the Jetwing Colombo 7 team of chefs want to mix up dishes to suit their guests, who come from everywhere, so they feel at home in the buzzy city that never sleeps. They also have an excellent mix of vegetarian dishes that cater for vegans and gluten-free palettes, as well as keeping the favourite meat-eaters dishes. My favourite experience was high speed lunch from the on the run menu at a great price, which allows one to meet and do business over a good range of dishes that are quick to prepare, so that you can get back to work fast after having fun on the run.
Sunday lunch is a very exclusive affair for around 20 tables each week with an excellent Degustation Lunch at 57, which is all about tasting new things with matching wines, to develop the concept of matching food dishes with the perfect wines from around the world, something Jetwing Hotels is particularly proud of. There is always a surprise dish hidden by smoke so it makes it a very special Sunday or pre-valentines experience that is unique to the capital. Smoked Lamb Saddle is served with an exciting joie de view and other unforgettable courses follow.
A tale about afternoon tea is a classic English affair served upstairs with spectacular views from 3 to 5.30pm so you can enjoy the nice weather and stunning sun set over the city with old fashioned old school British proper cucumber sandwiches and scones with jam and clotted cream that you could have in Cornwall where it comes from. Jetwing Colombo 7 even celebrates British traditions of cuisine of where tea was their finest hour and can be yours after a busy morning of meetings.
A delightful place with a whole range of new foodie experiences built on the land of the owners two family homes, is the result of centuries of evolution, colonisation, independence and today truly inventive world class cuisine and innovation that recognises the importance of blending the old with the new. Singapore, another key Asian trading port, once looked to Colombo during the 1960s for inspiration but today the tables have turned, or perhaps merged, as they show the world the rich diversity and architectural layers that have come together during the different periods of time that value both the contemporary and the historic. The Jetwing Colombo Seven architect from Singapore, Sim Boon Yang of Eco ID, has reversed the islands most famous architect Bawas concept of inside outside living to outside inside design in the most brilliant and inspiring way. This new five star hotel may just be the start of Jetwing Colombo 7s foodie safaris that celebrate the ancient Sri Lankan traditions of cooking in pots to presenting it on different plates in many different ways so you can fully enjoy the orchestra of island tastes.

Family Budget Unit to help with home economy of families
The new Family Budget Unit will look into solving the economic issues faced by families in the country and look into a familys expenditure, income and the ways in which the countrys economy impacts individual families, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Prime Minister was speaking at the new Family Budget Unit of the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs which would look into the family economy which held its inaugural meeting at Temple Trees yesterday.
We have started a new unit under the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs- the Family Budget Unit. We have information on the national economy and we turn that information into action. But, we need to gather more information on the home economy, the Prime Minister said.
When we speak of the Cost of Living, we need to emphasise on essential food items. But today, home expenditure does not only include essential foods, it includes many other expenses. Transport, clothes, tuition fees, telephone bills, rent, pre-school fees, etc And some families spend more money on these than food, the Prime Minister further said.
Thus, the new unit will look into what the main expenses in a family are, the average income of a family and what is the impact of the countrys economy on the family, the Premier said.
We have prepared a developing economy for the people so that they can live. We have given them many concessions and we will take a look at these once again and the government will adjust these subsidies according to the available finances. This will be important for the new unit, the Prime Minister said.
State Finance Minister Eran Wickremaratne, National Policies and Economic Affairs, Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva, Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Ekanayake, National Policies and Economic Affairs Minister Secretary K.D.S. Ruwan Chandra and Finance and Mass Media Secretary Dr. R.H.S.Samaratunga were also present at the meeting.

Fox still expects to win takeover
The Murdoch-controlled 21st Century Fox has said it continues to expect UK approval of its Sky takeover, despite a provisional finding that the deal was not in the public interest.
Chief executive James Murdoch said the firm was working with authorities to resolve concerns.
Mr Murdoch made the remarks on a call with financial analysts to discuss the firm's quarterly earnings.
Last year, the firm struck a deal to sell assets, including Sky, to Disney.
That deal would leave Fox more narrowly focused on news and sports. It is also pending approval by regulators in the US and elsewhere.
The firm said the two transactions are designed to set up the firm's companies for long term growth.
The Sky deal, in which would Fox would buy the 61% it does not own, pre-dates the plans for Disney and has been delayed amid opposition in the UK.
In January, the UK Competition and Markets Authority found that if the deal went ahead as planned, it would give the Murdoch family too much control over news providers in the UK.
Mr Murdoch said the firm continues to expect that deal to be approved by the end of June.
"We'll continue to engage constructively... to address their concerns ahead of their May first final report," he said.
Fox said quarterly revenue climbed to more than $8bn (5.8bn), up 4.6% compared with the same period in 2016.
The firm's cable networks, which include its flagship Fox News channel, drove the gains, which were stronger than expected. Profits more than doubled to $1.9bn, due to a $1.34bn one-off benefit from changes to the US tax code.
Fox chairman Lachlan Murdoch said Fox is focused on live sports as it plots a future as a smaller company.
Last week, the firm said it had signed a five-year deal granting broadcast rights to Thursday night American football games.
Analysts on the call questioned the costs of the deal amid rating declines for the sport.

Global Independent audit regulators  to meet in Colombo
Independent audit regulators from around the world will gather to share their expertise during the 12th Annual Inspection Workshop of the International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators (IFIAR) in Colombo.
The Sri Lanka Accounting and Auditing Standards Monitoring Board (SLAASMB) is hosting the three-day forum which will be held at the Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel from February 20 with the participation of over 110 professionals representing audit regulators from 40 countries including, USA, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Switzerland, Japan and Singapore.
The event will be inaugurated at a ceremony on February 19 and will be attended by a host of experts in the field.
IFIAR was established by independent audit regulators from around the world in 2007. IFIARs overall objectives are to share knowledge of the audit market environment and practical experience of independent audit regulatory activities, to promote collaboration in regulatory activities, and to provide a platform for dialogue with other international organisations which have interests in enhancing audit quality.
SLAASMB, Sri Lankas Independent Audit Regulator was established under the Sri Lanka Accounting and Auditing Standards Act No. 15 of 1995. The core functions of SLAASMB are to monitor compliance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards in relation to the annual audited financial statements of Specified Business Enterprises(SBEs) and to monitor compliance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards when conducting audits of these financial statements by auditors of such SBEs.
These standards on accounting and auditing formulated by the CA Sri Lanka are aligned with International Financial Reporting Standards and International Standards on Auditing.
SLAASMB has been a member of the International Forum of Independent Audit since 2007. Resulting from the long-term association with the IFIAR, SLAASMBs audit inspection methodology has been aligned with the global practices on improving audit quality within the Sri Lankan financial environment.
SLAASMB has been monitoring compliance with accounting standards since 2000 and began audit inspections in 2007. SLAASMB communicates violation of standards to the respective SBE or auditor in the form of letters of assistance.
However, based on the significance of the issues, action taken by SLAASMB includes getting such SBEs to correct the issue in the next financial statements to be published or issued, re-publish financial statements, re-audit financial statements,issue warning letters to auditors or resort to more stringent action such as referring to other regulators and or litigation.
During the 18 years in active operation, SLAASMB has been able to get SBEs to correct financial statements to the value of Rs. 56 billion.

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has written to the President, the Prime Minister and all relevant authorities requesting intervention to introduce Minimum Standards for medical education.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the current minimum standard of medical education which is two C passes and 1 S pass is much lower than the real and acceptable minimum standard for medical education for this year (2018) and should be 3 B passes.
Dr. Aluthge said during the meeting held on January 30, the Health Minister had informed the GMOA that the cabinet approved the current minimum standard without considering the minimum standard (3 B passes) agreed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), GMOA and all relevant parties.
The SLMC, GMOA, Deans of all medical faculties and all the other relevant parties had agreed to accept the any previous years minimum qualifications of a medical student who entered any Sri Lankan state medical faculty, based on the Z score as the minimum standard for medical education for the next year. Accordingly, it should be 3 B passes for this year (2018), he added.

Goldman sets GDP growth forecast  at 6.5%
The Chinese mainland's accelerated structural reform and efforts to cut debt levels might lead to a mild slowdown in gross domestic product expansion this year, investment bank Goldman Sachs said, setting its growth forecast for the year at 6.5 percent.
Andrew Tilton, managing director of global investment research at Goldman Sachs, said the mainland had performed well last year. A credit-growth slowdown normally held the economy back, but GDP continued to grow despite the deleveraging.
China's GDP grew 6.9 percent last year, up from 6.7 percent in 2016, the National Bureau of Statistics said.
A pickup in exports amid the global recovery last year, which did not involve much leverage, accounted for some of the rise, Tilton reflected. Goldman also saw a fiscal expansion, including local-government spending. The bank expects policy tightening in some areas to curb GDP growth.
Regulations in housing and anti-pollution measures are likely to stay in place if not tighten; where we do think will have more policy tightening is in shadow banking. There is also a possibility that policy makers are trying to reign in the borrowing and spending activities of local governments, Tilton said.
The Finance Ministry last year cracked down on public-private partnership projects, a heavily promoted model since 2014 that channels private money into public infrastructure projects. The model was overhauled when regulators found local governments had widely abused projects as disguised borrowing.
Consumer spending will continue to be the driving force of the country's economy, as the mainland shifts from an investment-led to consumption-led economy, Goldman said.
A strong labor market, expanding consumer credit and big household savings augur well for consumer spending, the bank said. Goldman had an above-consensus forecast of 4.1 percent growth for global GDP this year, expecting broad-based momentum across advanced and emerging markets aided by relatively easy financial conditions and benign inflation.
The bank estimated the United States Federal Reserve would raise interest rates four times this year but chances that the mainland will follow in their steps are slim, Tilton said. If the inflation surprised on the upside we might see a rate hike, but having said that this is not what we have expected, policy has been tightening in many other ways that would all weigh on growth. They don't need to raise the rates further, he said.(China Daily)

Google to further help  Chinese companies go global
Google Inc will step up efforts to help Chinese companies expand their presence in countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road initiative, as the United States tech giant aims to grow its advertising revenue from the country, company executives said. Annabel Lin, director of sales at Google China, said Chinese companies are making a strong push to go global, which will bring good opportunities for the company.
Clients including cross-border e-commerce and other export-focused companies are growing at a double-digit rate. We hope their strong momentum can also be reflected in our own business, Lin said.
On Tuesday, the company published a white paper to analyze markets related to the Belt and Road Initiative by partnering with Peking University, in a move to help Chinese companies find proper ways to expand their business in related economies. Google also unveiled a list of the top 50 Chinese global brand builders in partnership with the global advertising company WPP and Kantar Millward Brown. The 2018 rankings list the Chinese brands that have most successfully established a presence in overseas markets. Consumer electronics companies such as Huawei, Oppo and DJI are among the fastest-growing Chinese brands. Lenovo is ranked as No 1 on the list. China Business News

Huawei overtakes Apple as C-NPS customers  recommended brand in China
China-leading brand rating organization Chnbrand, recently released China Net Promoter Score Index (C-NPS) research results for 2018.
With a score of 17.8 points, Huawei has overtaken Apple for the first time as the C-NPS Customers Most Recommended Brand in Chinas Mobile Phone Industry 2018, making it the first ever local mobile phone brand to take the first place on this list.
As Chinas first system assessing customer willingness to recommend things, the C-NPS offers independent, scientifically sound and latest survey results to reflect consumers voices and willingness to recommend products or services. It is therefore a key indicator for measuring brand-specific word of mouth and customer loyalty. Huaweis having been named the C-NPS Customers Most Recommended Brand in Chinas Mobile Phone Industry 2018 is attributable not just to the fact that its consistent customer-centric strategy has been widely accepted in the market, but more importantly to its success by staying focused on technological innovation.
Weve built our success upon taking quality as the top priority and making continuous investment in innovation, which is also the primary reason why Huawei is increasingly accepted by consumers, said the head of Huawei Consumer Business. Going forward, we will stay true to our business philosophy that Huawei consumer businesss competitiveness starts from and ends at consumers and keep innovating in a future-oriented manner, thereby bringing global consumers radically improved user experiences and taking the lead in industrial changes, he further added.
Innovation has been the primary driving force for Huaweis continuous rapid growth over the past decades. Huawei has long been creating value for the industry, the markets and consumers through continuous innovation, as it spends over 10% of annual sales revenue on R&D. Based on continuous investment in technological R&D and tight quality control, Huawei smartphones have become increasingly popular with global consumers. In Sri Lanka, Huawei is edging closer to become the number one smartphone brand with a strong market share of over 30%according to GfK report.This latest award is just another proof of Huaweis relentless pursuit of excellence.

KALUPERUMA a spin wizard who was lost to SL cricket
Whether it is the spinning magic of Muralitherean in an international class of his own, or before the giants in the local scene in Abu Fuard ,Niel Chanmugan or Mahinda Athulatmudali , the spinning Magicians have tormented batsmen with nightmarish regularity.
Unlike leg spin bowlers, the names of off spin bowlers who have tormented and mesmerized batsman come to mind a dime a dozen. And today we honor in this column a spinning wizard in LALITH KALUPERUMA a legend as we look into the the history of the game.
In Sri Lanka before the country entered the elusive portals of Test cricket off spinners who could have held their own or even bettered some of the more famous international off spinners come to mind..
Leading them was former Wesleyite the mercurial Abu Fuard (Colts and CCC), and in his exalted company there were Niel Chanmugam (Tamil Union and SSC), Mahinda Athulathmudali (Saracens and Adastrians), V.Mahendren (NCC), Cyril Ernest (Adastrians) and Gordon Dissanayake (Nomads). Ernest and Dissanyakewho played under my captaincy for St.Benedicts College in 1960.
Muralitheran magic
There was also Ralston Burke (Saracens), U.L.C. Perera (BRC), Suraj Randiv (Bloomfield) and LALITH KALUPERUMA (Bloomfield). Later the man who spun and stunned the cricket world with his off spinning magic was Muttiah Muralitheran of (Tamil Union).
Sadly Fuard and Chanmugam who not only mesmerized batsmen with their repertoire of deliveries are no more. Not only were they classy off spinners but great all rounders, but also batsmen who made big runs. In this category belonged Cyril Ernest and Ralston Burke who were also all rounders of repute. The game today lacks off spinning all rounders of that class
But LALITH WASANTHA SILVA KALUPERUMA is a story unto himself. Had he not cut short his career by going on the rebel tour of South Africa he would have joined the elite off spinning all rounders.
Played in Two Tests
KALUPERUMA played in only Two Test matches. In the inaugural one against England at the Colombo Oval from February 17 to 21, 1982 and one other Test against Pakistan In Faisalabad from March 14 to 19, 1982 and In those two Tests he showed glimpses of becoming an off spinning all rounder of the highest caliber. But the eagerness to visit the inhuman Apartheid Country called finis to his career.
KALUPERUMA was a cunning off spinner with all skills in his craft to lure batsmen to their demise. He flighted the ball cleverly to lure the batsmen out of the crease, bowled the top spinner and had the one that goes the other way with an off break action which Muralitheran did and which was called the doosra.
As a batsman he was safe offering a straight bat and had strokes all round the wicket with the off drive his pet stroke. As a fielder he was safe and sound like the Bank of England at gully and grabbed some stunning catches. I have played against him in Sara cricket and can vouch for these excellent abilities.
Automatic choice
KALUPERUMA was an automatic choice in the Inaugural Test against England at the Oval in 1982,but did not get a long bowl due to the presence of leggie D.S.de Silva and left arm leggie Ajit de Silva. But in the few overs he bowled he troubled the opposing batsmen. He played in one more Test against Pakistan in Faisalabad and was given only six overs.
He came back and threw in his lot with the team that toured Apartheid country that saw him banned from the game for 25 years on his return like did the other players who went on that shameful tour.
Playing and captaining Bloomfield he steered them to win the premier trophy in the1980 /81 tournament. But it was in 1970 that he performed a historic feat by taking four wickets in four balls.
First ball wicket
Another feat that KALUPERUMA will remember will be the wicket he took of Indian captain Ajit Wadekar with the first ball he bowled in an unofficial test. He was in the Sri Lanka Board Presidents X1 and playing in the Gopalan Trophy game against Tamil Nadu he captured 8 wickets for 43 and 2 for 36 to have a match haul of 10 for 79 which was no mean achievement.
After quitting the game he moved into the administration and was made Chairman of the Selection Committee replacing former fast bowling Sri Lanka all rounder Asantha de Mel. There were many controversial issues during his tenure, but with his experience and know how solved them to the satisfaction of all.
Be it in the international or local cricket scene, the names of off spinners come readily to mind. In the international scene the name that will not be easily forgotten are that of England wily off spinning sensation Jim Laker who ran rings around the Australian batsmen to bag 19 wickets in a Test match and Lance Gibbs of West Indies who took a hat-trick against Australia which saw the first ever tied Test match in the 1960/61 series that brought the fire back into Test cricket.
Lakers stupendous feat
The Sports Special pages of the Daily News on January 11, 2018 featured Jim Lakers stupendous feat with a picture of him walking back to the pavilion on 31st July 1956 at Old Trafford, Manchester where he took 19 scalps to help England beat the Australians and win the series. After a course in Journalism in West Berlin in 1976 when I was Sports Editor in chief of the Times Group, I went over to England and had the good fortune of being the guest of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office of Information for three days and on my request they arranged for me to meet the great Laker and also the most young promising player of that time in England Mike Gatting.
Meeting Laker in person and while greeting him and touching his right hand that electrocuted the Aussie batsmen with his vicious off spin with my Public Relations Officer Mrs S Goodhew was an unforgettable experience which is still etched in my memory. Talking cricket with Laker over lunch at the Park Tower Hotel in Knightsbridge, London was a great learning experience in my growing days as a cricket writer.

'King' James rules as Cavs edge Timberwolves in overtime
LOS ANGELES AFP Feb8, 2018
LeBron James drained a fadeaway jump shot at the buzzer in overtime on Wednesday to lift the embattled Cleveland Cavaliers to a 140-138 NBA victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves.
James finished with 37 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds for his ninth triple double of the season and the 64th of his career.
With a second to go in overtime he produced a crucial block of a shot by Jimmy Butler and after a timeout the Cavaliers had a chance to bring the ball inbounds.
Jeff Green threw it down to the foul line where James caught it, turned and beat Butler with the game-winner.
It was a much-needed win for a Cavs team in turmoil, having lost their last two games by a total of 50 points -- including a humiliating 116-98 loss to the Orlando Magic on Tuesday.
It was a great win for us, James said. We needed this after that tough loss last night. The Cavaliers are now 7-13 since Christmas. Their struggles have been so severe that James was even asked if he would consider waiving his no-trade clause if the team could make a deal for him by Thursday's trade deadline.
James said he couldn't give up on his teammates in that way -- although that didn't curb speculation that the Cavaliers could look significantly different by Friday as they try to find a way to get their bid to reach a fourth straight NBA Finals back on track.
In the meantime, however, the current Cavs pulled out all the stops to avenge their 28-point loss to Minnesota on January 8.
Seven Cavaliers players scored in double figures in a see-saw battle that saw 34 lead changes and 16 ties.
The teams combined for an NBA record 40 three-pointers.
Butler led the Timberwolves with 35 and Karl-Anthony Towns added 30.
Andrew Wiggins' jump shot with 1:25 left in overtime put Minnesota up 138-136. James's layup knotted the score at 138-138 with 24 seconds remaining.
Butler drove to the basket against Cavs rookie Cedi Osman with a chance to win it, but James came from the weak side and rose to swat the shot away.
Smith came up with the rebound to set the stage for the winning play.
Coach Lue called up a great play, James said. Jeff Green gave me a heck of a pass and I just trusted my instincts to let it go.

Lost in the translation
Last week I had the joy of meeting up with an old friend domiciled in the United States. A professor of Philosophy at an American university, he had come down to participate in a forum at the Galle Literary Festival, the glamorous shindig of the Sri Lankan literati.
His busy schedule allowed only for an all too short a meeting in Colombo, a chat and a hurried meal. Rest of his stay was spent at the Old Dutch Fort in the South, now turned into a touristy heritage site, exploring the wonders of the written word.
Lost in translation or the problems of translation; ideas and words of one language being explained through the words and ideas of another were the topics his forum was to explore. What is perceived by one way of looking at things, looked at by different eyes, by way of a translation One literatures engagement with the human spirit and sensitivities; endeavour and failure, achievement and celebration, heroism and cowardice, human frailties, tragedy and other concerns of a particular people; explained in the language of another literature. An exact translation, in idiom and nuance, even in the hands of the most sensitive translator, is a challenging endeavour, if not impossible in the complete sense.
Obviously, problems arise not only in the translation of the written word but even in the adoption of foreign institutions and concepts. Britain or the culture thereof, created a parliament, the office of the prime minister and various other political/legal institutions and systems, which were later adopted by her former colonies. But is the true meaning of these institutions and systems, lost in translation, ending only as a sorry parody Things that gave cohesion and stability to a people, builders of a powerful and prosperous country with a global impact, ending as mere instruments of abuse and corruption in the inept hands of a people, of a very different timbre.
Driving to the restaurant, we had to stop at a pedestrian crossing. There was only a single pedestrian and he was by no means in a hurry to cross the road.
This man is just sauntering across the wide road as if he has all the time in the world and the road was made only for him! I hate to say this, but this is the kind of behaviour often observed among the coloured people in America, perhaps they dont value their lives enough to make a quick and purposeful crossing. Why would such a person value your time.
Civil and disciplined conduct
It is a well-observed fact that the people of the tropics have a slower gait than those of the occident. Still, an effort can be made to cross the road, used by thousands of others, quicker. We now have mechanized vehicles and sealed roads as our mode and method of transportation, an advancement which gives rapid mobility to thousands of commuters and vehicles at the same time. The system works best with a certain road culture, based on civil and disciplined conduct. New developments allow us to travel with dignity and in a certain style, unlike a stampeded herd of cattle. On our roads, we observe a different way of thinking, oblivious to the complexity of the network and its many stakeholders, treating the road as if it was built only for that one person to travel. Even at a pedestrian crossing, the right to cross can be over claimed; negating the purpose of the road.
A persons importance (or even value) is measured by our society from the degree of autonomy he enjoys on the road; the extent to which the man may ignore the rules that apply. How can someone be an important person, if he has to follow the rules like everybody else More laws a person can disregard, more important he surely is!
Most times, the traffic laws are broken by the high and mighty with an officer of the law (on a motorcycle or a high powered cab) leading the way as a pilot, waving other road users off the road. It seems that the idea of elected or delegated power is lost in translation in the native mind, moulded only on the realities of hereditary and absolute power. Sure, VIP travel may well happen in other countries, in the UK, in Singapore and so on; but the grasp of the road culture in these countries is manifest in the infrequency and the limitation of such disruptions, restrained manner and the responsibility shown by those concerned. Monopolizing the road is not a right, but only a privilege to be enjoyed occasionally and discreetly.
By no means is the failure to understand the importance of road civility limited to those in positions of power. Often it is the lowly; the three-wheeler, the motorcyclist, the bus driver who manifest the most damnable selfishness and indiscipline. Perhaps the minions are tempted to do sneakily, what the rulers do openly. They will cut across oncoming traffic, overtake on the wrong side, honk rudely and park anywhere and everywhere to achieve their ends: small victories, in a life of stress, hardship and defeat.
Similarly, there appears to be an inevitable loss of meaning when public office(whether it be the presidency, premiership or even an elected peoples representative)originally developed in an alien culture, are adopted by a civilization with an entirely different evolution and mental make-up. What is the purpose of such an office Is it an opportunity for a person with leadership qualities and the requisite skills, to serve society, or is the purpose understood (misunderstood) in countries like ours, to be something else altogether
London, a major financial hub
In England we have not, to my knowledge, had close family members succeeding each other to high positions such as the office of the Prime Minister. If at all, it will be a rare exception, an occurrence that will only prove the rule. There are many cases of Prime Ministers resigning on a technical loss of confidence, Cameron being a recent case in point (the will of the British people is an instruction that must be delivered - Cameron on resigning after the Brexit referendum)
Despite London being a major financial hub, with billions of pounds changing hands on a daily basis, cases of systematic and deliberate fraud are mercifully few among legislators. By and large, Englands institutions: the parliament, judicial system and the bureaucracy have preserved their good name. For a relatively small country, it has done very well; without one single document to be called a constitution, Churchill facing a fearsome World War with only a very small bodyguard, an unarmed constabulary whose authority rests on the law and not a gun, ministers and MPs who regularly ride to work by train; obviously, a very different outlook.
In the translating (or adoption) of these institutions, or understanding their meaning through the eyes of another culture, gross mutilations are caused to the idea of the public office. A leader in our society is a man born with the correct configuration of stars, to a family of leadership, merely claiming what merits he had earned in previous births, entitles. There is nothing wrong, therefore, in a public life being a lifetime occupation. It does not stop there. His family is also entitled to all the comforts; bungalows, cars, several bodyguards, foreign travel that this cash-strapped country can provide. And finally, what harm is there in bringing in his son or a family member to succeed him, after all, in this culture, leadership is explained through family genes
Sadly, despite all the medical attention received at plush hospitals in the West or Singapore - all paid for by the people, this man too is mortal, and one day will depart from this life form. Most likely, especially if his children are now leaders, an impressive memorial will be built for him by a grateful people, with their own money!
My friend was jet lagged and tired after his long flight. He thought a warm soup will relax him and help him to sleep later. The broth came after about twenty minutes, unappealing and cold; obviously not the creation of a man evolved in the particular culinary tradition.
Why is this soup not warm, my friend inquired.
The waiter had a look of incomprehension; why is he complaining, even after getting his soup
That is how we serve it here Sir, he said confusedly.

Microsoft warns firms of technology distractions
Technology can distract workers rather than make them more productive, suggests a survey carried out by software giant Microsoft.
Many of the 20,000 European workers questioned said a steady stream of emails, messages and notifications kept them from concentrating.
Others said the way their employer deployed technology also stopped them being more productive.
One expert said many staff suffered high levels of technostress.
The report, which sampled views in 21 European nations including the UK, found that only 11.4% of European workers said they felt highly productive.
Modern workers have an abundance of technology at their fingertips, said the report. But this availability doesn't necessarily translate into impact.
Endless amounts of updates and notifications arriving via social media made people less productive, said the report, as did other factors connected to technology.
Microsoft pointed to the dangers of constant connectivity which brought with it the expectation that staff would respond at all hours to messages and other requests.
These flexible working regimes many firms adopted often came with the assumption that people who worked longer hours would would be more productive.
The software firm's findings suggest that a company's digital culture could improve workers productivity and help them feel more involved.
Digital culture covered the way a company viewed and used technology, it said. This involved organisations knowing what they wanted to do with the software and systems they adopted and also giving staff the proper training and other help to use it.
It pointed to a number of supporting conditions that let people get the most out of technology. These covered everything from appropriate email response times to measuring if people were happy with the tech they used to do their day-to-day jobs.
In those companies that reported having a strong digital culture about 22% of employees felt highly productive, said the report. That strong sense of how technology helps also reduced the number of staff that felt disengaged to about 8%. By contrast, in companies where technology was not managed well about 20% felt disengaged. It's the unintended consequences you have to think through when you deploy technology, said Sir Cary Cooper, a professor of organisational psychology at the Manchester Business School who has written extensively on the technostress staff can suffer.
We do not want to throw the technology out because it's very good for communications, but we have not developed good guidelines on what counts as productive use of it, he said.
There's a whole field now called technostress in management science, Sir Cary told the BBC, saying that it dealt with the adverse consequences of adopting novel computer systems or software. Technologies can overload people and make them less productive because they get caught up in it rather than use it to deliver a service or a product.
Sir Cary said email had been named as the second most damaging issue by big firms who were members of the UK's National Forum for Health and Wellbeing at Work, that he helped to co-ordinate.
Acknowledging this, many firms now limited when emails can be sent in a bid to lighten the load on workers, he said.
Productivity comes from creative interchange, he said. It does not come from people sitting in front of machines sending emails. (BBC)

Monroe mania!
Marilyn Monroe has been dead for over 50 years. Yet she still has a powerful magnetic impact on people in today's world and a growing fan base.
One in particular is 32-year-old Cyril, who has already spent 5,000 on lip fillers and Botox over the course of 18 months, the Metro reported.
"I was first attracted to cosmetic procedures as I wanted to look younger and more like my inspiration, Marilyn Monroe," Cyril is quoted as saying by the Metro. He had his first Botox session at the age of 26. Since then he has had more than 20 different procedures and 16 lip fillers and Botox sessions. While he has encountered some unkind strangers for his transformation, he doesn't let it bother him. He also admitted he will not stop getting cosmetic procedures until he is happy with the look he wants.
He hopes to soon get a nose job, chin implants and cheek implants once he has save up enough money for the plastic surgery.

Muthuthantri to play  for CH today
Sri Lanka national sevens captain, Auckland Blues Sevens player cum former S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia crack third row forward Sudarshana Muthuthantri will play his first club match for CH and FC today as number eight against unpredictable CR & FC in a Dialog A division inter-club league second round match at Longden Place commencing 4 pm.
The rejuvenated CH side go out as firm favourites to overcome the red shirts but the game will be a closely fought out battle for supremacy.
We are really happy to have the Sri Lankan national sevens captain Muthu playing for us after arriving from New Zealand where he played for Auckland Blues sevens team and had a really successful season over there, said head coach of CH and FC, Western Samoan Tavita Thulagaese Laga.
I had also coached him before at Havelocks and he is a fabulous player and a great leader as well as a fantastic reader of the game. We have lot of faith in him and he will do his utmost to bring us to the top of Sri Lankan rugby, Laga said.
Comparatively CH are the better team than CR in this ongoing league tournament winning against the red shirts in their first round game played at Race Course.
CR & FC will field the same team which did duty for them last week against Air Force.
The red shirts boast of having in their ranks quality talented hooker in the form of granite forward cum rolling maul specialist Supun Warnakulasuriya, who is playing a key role for them this season.
CH and FC will look to register another shock win in todays game through their think-tank and former national captain cum flanker Yoshitha Rajapaksa along with Muthuthantri who will lead them from the front.
The CR & FC outfit has failed to live upto expectations losing to Kandy SC, Army SC, CH and FC, Havelock SC and Navy SC in this years league tourney.
The red shirts have faced an unexpected plight losing some of their key players yet recovering from injuries are bound to field a couple of sidelined big names for todays game. However adding to the woes would be the absence of their experienced nippy national scrum half Kavindu de Costa from todays game due to a nasty injury he sustained in the league. Most probably Kavindu will be out for the rest of the season.
CR skipper Kavindu Perera will face another acid test to obtain a win in this game, while the inspirational CH skipper Rohitha Chichi Rajapaksa has fared admirably with the young resurgent force by pulling off a superb run away win over a fighting Police SC unit last week.
They will go all out to pull this one through with a bonus point victory to finish this years league as the third place team.
Teams:
CR & FC (Probable XV): Udara Gayan, Supun Warnakulasuriya, Kokila Sammandapperuma, Charana Chamikara, Gayan Jayamanna, Shemal Weerasekara or Sashika Ashan, Tariq Saleih or Shawqat Laheer, Omalka Gunaratne, Avishka Heenpalke or Harith Bandara and Tharinda Ratwatte, Chamod Fernando, Kushan Indunil, Kavindu Perera (Captain), Reeza Rafaideen, Rehan Silva or Nalin Kumara, Head Coach: Fereti Verabula (Fiji)

Naimbala Government Central Dispensary abandoned
The Naimbala Government Dispensary has no permanent building as yet, residents complain.
According to members of the staff of this medical institute, it is presently running in a rented old
building.The space and accommodation are hardly available there to conduct these medical services.
The shortage of essential medical drugs in this government dispensary has also been a big issue,
patients say. There is no State Osu Sala retail outlet nor a government pharmacy in Yatiyana and Thihagoda main towns at the present moment. Poor patients have to purchase prescribed drugs and medicines from private pharmacies at exorbitant rates as a result.
Material resources in this medical institute are nil. Maintenance of Clinics has also been badly
hampered under these difficult circumstances. The old building complex has currently been abandoned for years in view of lack of renovations. It is dilapidated and most parts of roofs of this building are in a state of decay.
Moreover, they are on the imminent verge of collapse, residents said.
The whole plot of land belonging to this government medical institute has presently been covered by weeds, wild plants and shrubs. No permanent parapet wall has still been constructed around this plot of land. Only a broken barbed wire boundary fence is to be seen there. Building walls,inner and outer doors and windows are to be painted anew. No dressing room is available there for the treatment of casualties. There is not a single room here for change overs for staff members nor a point of space to have their tea and meals. In spite of these practical hardships and difficulties they had to continue with medical services there, they stated.
Under these very difficult conditions, most of the emergency cases attending this state central
dispensary had to be transferred to Matara District General Hospital or the Kamburupitiya Regional Base Hospital, for urgent medical treatment, they stated.
According to latest statistical data available at the Thihagoda Divisional Secretariat Office, the
total population in the region are almost nearly one hundred thousand. Therefore, the urgent need of a Divisional Hospital for the Thihagoda Divisional Secretariat area has been emphasized by the people, they said.
Due to this sad situation, residents request the authorities responsible that immediate remedial
measures be initiated to rectify these shortcomings prevailing in the currently abandoned old Naimbala Government Central Dispensary and expeditious action also be taken to upgrade the same to the status of a divisional hospital.

From January 1, to December, 31, 2017, about 2,910 fatal road accidents have taken place in Sri Lanka and from these accidents, about 3,078 persons had died on roads. Among them, there were 935 pedestrians, 998 motor cyclists, 239 drivers, 423 passengers and 289 push bicycle riders.

Consul General and Trade Commissioner for New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, Ralph Hays along with a team from Mumbai paid a courtesy call on the CEO of the Chamber and the Ex-Co of SLANZBC.
The visit was mainly focused on a forthcoming New Zealand trade delegation that is to visit Sri Lanka this year. Hays and his team expressed that Sri Lankan enterprise is being viewed as an attraction and a compelling investment opportunity, particularly in augmenting the global supply chain. Following the Sri Lanka  Singapore FTA, enthusiasm for opportunities to invest in the Sri Lankan Market has sparked amongst New Zealand companies in Singapore, and even across India and the Middle East.
The trade mission is set to take place in April and will provide Sri Lankan businesses the opportunity to participate in B2B meetings and forge business partnerships with New Zealand delegates. Currently 15 New Zealand companies have signed up for the trade mission with keen prospects of entering the Sri Lankan market. Amongst the products that delegates seek to promote in Sri Lanka are Information Technology, infrastructure, manufacturing, healthcare, and food and beverage.
With more delegates expected to come aboard the trade mission, the promotion of more products is anticipated. This being the third consecutive trade delegation from New Zealand speaks of its market success.

Making wedding puppy portraits is the easy solution, get them nicely groomed and snap away. But Gil and Luna went for something more imaginative than that. Einstein, a 3-year-old Pembroke Welsh Corgi, and Chimney, a 10-year-old Jack Russell and Pug mix, were forever immortalized as part of the topper for the couples gorgeous wedding cake, and they are just too cute!
It turns out that there is an increasing trend for this kind of thing, as more and more people seek to doggify their big day. There are a huge range of options available for those who want to include their precious pups in their nuptials, from doggy themed cakes and toppers to ring bearing collars.

PDO assists beauty culture entrepreneurs
Policy Development Office (PDO) functioning under the Prime Ministers Office is working on finding solutions to problems faced by beauty culture entrepreneurs, PDO said in a media release yesterday.
The PDOs islandwide survey on identifying issues in the field of beauty culture recorded a high response rate. The PDO has begun working on providing solutions to problems identified in the survey, taking into consideration suggestions made by entrepreneurs during the survey.
The PDO is still receiving data and the analyzing process is yet to be concluded. So far, two main issues have been identified from the available data, namely, no convenient locations for beauty salons and lack of capital to develop and improve them.
To provide solutions for these problems, the PDO is consulting divisional secretaries and local government officials. The PDO has begun discussions with the Central Bank in order to resolve the issue of lack of capital, the media release said.
The field of beauty culture has been recognized as an accomplished profession. This project focuses on creating beauty salons with high standards and modern technology and generating successful young entrepreneurs in a high-quality beauty culture sector in future in Sri Lanka, the PDO said.

The veteran California Democrat, who turns 78 next month, took the floor at 10:04 am (1504 GMT) and began to speak. And she kept speaking. And speaking. And speaking.
Eight hours and seven minutes later, at 6:11 pm, she relinquished the floor -- an entire work day standing at her desk in four-inch (10-centimeter) heels and consuming nothing but water, according to an aide.
It was a remarkable display of determination by the minority leader and former House speaker, which ended with her high-fiving Democratic colleagues who gave her a standing ovation.
I just got word that the House historian confirms that you have now set the record for the longest continuous speech in the House since at least 1909, said Pelosi during her marathon, reading aloud from a clerks message.
I wonder what that was. That honor belonged to congressman Champ Clark of Missouri, who spoke for five hours and 15 minutes. It was unclear if any House floor speeches before 1909 had gone longer.
Pelosi was speaking against a compromise federal budget deal recently announced by Senate leaders that would lift spending caps and avert a looming government shutdown -- but does not address immigration.
Pelosi said she would oppose the deal unless House Speaker Paul Ryan gave assurances he would bring immigration legislation to the floor for a vote. Americans need a solution to immigration, which is long overdue, she said.
Pelosi was not violating House rules with her record-busting speech. Party leaders technically take the floor for one minute, but are allowed to speak for as long as they wish.
At times she turned to scripture, and cited the biblical tale of the Good Samaritan. She also read directly from statements by dozens of immigrants known as Dreamers -- people who arrived in the United States illegally as children but were protected from deportation under president Barack Obamas Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
In September President Donald Trump ended DACA, but gave Congress several months to craft a solution. If Congress does not act by the March 5 deadline, some 1,000 immigrants per day could face deportation. Our Dreamers hang in limbo, with a cruel cloud of fear and uncertainty above them, Pelosi said.
The Republican moral cowardice must end. While the Republican side of the chamber was largely empty, dozens of Democrats trickled in to hear Pelosi, or sit behind their leader offering support.
Im proud to be here in solidarity with @NancyPelosi demanding action to #protectDreamers, congresswoman Betty McCollum tweeted, using the hashtag #GoNancyGo.
Take note, @realDonaldTrump: THIS is what true leadership looks like, added House Democrat Gwen Moore.
Some Republicans signalled their displeasure with Pelosi eating up valuable floor time.
Once again, Democrats are threatening to hold government funding & pay for our troops hostage over an unrelated issue, House Republican Steve Pearce tweeted.
While impressive, Pelosis speech is far from the longest in congressional history.
That distinction goes to Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who in opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1957 delivered an obstructive Senate speech known as a filibuster that lasted 24 hours and 18 minutes.
More recently, Senator Ted Cruz spoke for 21 hours and 18 minutes on the Senate floor in 2013, at one point reading from the Dr. Seuss childrens book Green Eggs and Ham, to oppose funding then-President Barack Obamas health care reform law.

## Title: PHENOMINAL SENSE AND SENSIBILITY
## Supertitle:

PHENOMINAL SENSE AND SENSIBILITY
It is the incumbent president. He epitomizes strong understanding and cool judgment. A prismic view of the political behaviour of the recent past of the country and the great many speeches the Sri Lankan electorate listened to drive home the idea that the incumbent president seems to be on the grooming for a genuine leader for the country which has been eroded by mass scale ransacking of the public coffers in broad daylight.
President strongly understands the status quo of the debt-ridden nation and his judgment without fear or favour and signals the nation a turning point of the nations body politics. It seems that the president feels the heartbeat of the people. Sensibility is much needed in nation building. The severe lack of sense and sensibility of the rejected leaders bear ample testimony for its relevance in leadership. Creeping into the legislature through the backdoor when one is discarded into the political dustbin is a disgrace in our country.
His recent views on forming a broad front of uncorrupted intelligentsia could be a welcome note to the weary nation. And as a writer with a literary leniency, I would like to make a fervent request to harness classical literature for a future good governance strategy with a neoclassical approach in line with the poetic icons in this sphere John Dryden and Alexander Pope. They adroitly advocated the paramount importance of rationality in ruling a country, not in uncertain terms. It is still valid under any circumstances.
Global image
Irrationality in the political mind set both at the grass root level and the epicenter of power have been ruining the country during the last two decades. The irreparable damage done to the body politics and the total global image of the nation has become the beggars wound in the long run. Yet, the far reaching precautionary measures taken by the astute leadership of the president blocked the furtherance of the cancerous effect. Proverbially, with regard to the foreign policy frontier, the country emerged through the ashes as the phoenix.
We lost Geneva due to our Zimri in politics. The smooth inflow of foreign aids and the direct investments by foreign nationals prompt us to think that the nation is on the correct footing for the time being. Any off shoot political attempt to sabotage this political path in the short run would haul the country to a precipitous abyss. It would be a crime unpardonable to the hilt.
Political development
In my silent observation of the recent political development of the country, I was able to realize that a great many social, political, economic, health, global educational and other issues in almost all the spheres were insightfully imbibed by the president keeping the judgment reserved for him to declare at the correct time at the correct place. Not to be at the wrong place at the wrong time seems to be his guiding principle. For strong understanding and cool judgment Elenor is the perfect example in the tapestry of English fiction. Sense and Sensibility authored by Jane Austen gives us a mountain of evidence to be easeful through cool judgment. The president is veritably of that sort and I was taken aback by his witty references to the Central Bank bond issue that stormed the whole country. The sinister efforts to sweep it under the carpet became futile because of his stately craftsmanship that is fitting to a global leader.
Bofaur scam in nearby India and the Watergate in the USA brought much harm to those countries in the long run and from time to time they still emanate the peculiar nauseating bad smell. The bond commission could be viewed as one of the phenomenal triumphs of the timely cool judgment of this great leader of farsightedness.
The most conspicuous aspect of this great political figure of our time in my little understanding is that he is tamed by much needed sensibility that a national leader in turbulent times should essentially need. Aversion of nepotism, negativity to dictatorial rule, blockade of the wastage of national income, social justice, reservation for the underdog and many resurrecting measures boldly taken for the uplift of the country deserve the nations respect.
Let me reimagine that the leaders are born, not made.

Philippines mulls tapping  Alibaba's financial technology  for Filipinos abroad
The Philippines is mulling tapping Alibaba's financial technology solutions through its related company Ant Financial to lower remittance costs for the Philippines over 10 million migrant workers and offer them other online-based banking and financial management services.
In a statement released on Thursday, Philippine Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez said Ant Financial's low-cost mobile payment technology that has helped China attain financial inclusion for its small home-based enterprises can be tapped to help overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) send money back home and prudently manage their finances.
The Overseas Filipinos Bank (OFB), which is based in Manila, can be the launching pad for this online payment platform, Dominguez said.
OFB was launched last month by President Rodrigo Duterte to cater to the financial needs of not only OFWs but other foreign-based Filipinos as well.
There are over 10 million Filipinos working abroad, Ant Financial's technology is helpful for them. The technology can help them manage their cash, their earnings wisely, said Dominguez.
Dominguez, along with Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano, Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno, Central Bank of the Philippines Deputy Governor Maria Almasara Cyd Tuano Amador, Bases Conversion and Development Authority president Vivencio Dizon and other government officials and representatives from the Philippines business sector attended the Alibaba Business School's three-day New Economy Workshop.
The workshop was organized following the invitation last year of Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma for Dominguez and other Philippine officials to learn more about Alibaba's digital infrastructure for e-commerce.
Eric Jing, the chief executive officer of the Ant Financial Services Group, said his company would be more than willing to partner with the Philippines to bring inclusive financial services to OFWs and as well as other individuals and Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises.
Alibaba delegates also showed the Philippine delegation its unmanned restaurant here, the Wufangzhai, where customers order by scanning the QR codes, and independently pick up and clear away their meals before paying with their smartphones.
Dominguez said the lectures prepared by Alibaba revolved around the points discussed during my meeting with Jack Ma last November in Manila. (Chinadaily)

Read more to discover more
In terms of fiction or non-fiction, there are endless stories that can both broaden your understanding of the worldor help you get through a sticking point in your life. Those who read have been known to have more finely-tuned brains than those who prefer more passive activities, so anyone hoping to improve their mind both psychologicallyand cognitively might want to think about taking up the habit of regular reading.
TO DEVELOP YOUR VERBAL ABILITIES
Although it doesnt always make you a better communicator, those who read tend to have a more varied range of words to express how they feel and to get their point across. This increases exponentially with the more volumes you consume, giving you a higher level of vocabulary to use in everyday life.
IMPROVES YOUR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION
Unlike blog posts and news articles, sitting down with a book takes long periods of focus and concentration, which at first is hard to do. Being fully engaged in a book involves closing off the outside world and immersing yourself into the text, which over time will strengthen your attention span.
READERS ENJOY THE ARTS AND IMPROVE THE WORLD
A study done by the NEA explains that people who read for pleasure are many times more likely than those who do not to visit museums and attend concerts, and almost three times as likely to perform volunteer and charity work. Readers are active participants in the world around them, and that engagement is critical to individual and social well-being.
IT IMPROVES YOUR IMAGINATION
You are only limited by what you can imagine, and the worlds described in books, as well as other peoples views and opinions, will help you expand your understanding of what is possible. By reading a written description of an event or a place, your mind is responsible for creating that image in your head, instead of having the image placed in front of you when you watch television.
READING MAKES YOU SMARTER
Books offer an outstanding wealth of learning and at a much cheaper price than taking a course. Reading gives you a chance to consume huge amount of research in a relatively short amount of time. Anne E. Cunningham and Keith E. Stanovichs What Reading Does for the Mind also noted that heavy readers tend to display greater knowledge of how things work and who or what people were. Books at home have been strongly linked to academic achievement. If you are looking for a list of great books to read, check out 10 Easy To Read Books That Make You Smarter.
IT MAKES YOU INTERESTINGAND ATTRACTIVE
This goes hand in hand with reading to become smarter. Having a library of information that you have picked up from non-fiction reading will come in handy in any academic or scholarly conversation. You will be able to hold your own and add to the conversation instead of having to make your excuses and leave. You will be able to engage a wider variety of people in conversation and in turn improve your knowledge and conversation skills.
IT REDUCES STRESS
A study by consultancy firm Mindlab International at the University of Sussex showed that reading reduces stress. Subjects only needed to read, silently, for six minutes to slow down the heart rate and ease tension in the muscles. In fact it got subjects to stress levels lower than before they started. For more information, check out the Telegraph article here. Why read
IT IMPROVES YOUR MEMORY
In their book Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain, Maryanne Wolf explains that Typically, when you read, you have more time to think. Reading gives you a unique pause button for comprehension and insight. By and large, with oral language when you watch a film or listen to a tape, you dont press pause. The benefits of this increased activity keeps your memory sharp and your learning capacity nimble.
TO DISCOVER AND CREATE YOURSELF
In his book How to Read and Why, Harold Bloom says that we should read slowly, with love, openness, and with our inner ear cocked. He explains we should read to increase our wit and imagination, our sense of intimacyin short, our entire consciousness and also to heal our pain. Until you become yourself, what benefit can you be to others. With the endless amount of perspectives and lives we can read about, books can give us an opportunity to have experiences that we havent had the opportunity to, and still allow us to learn the life skills they entail. Books are a fast rack to creating yourself.
FOR ENTERTAINMENT
All the benefits of reading mentioned so far are a bonus result of the most important benefit of reading; Its entertainment value. If it were not for the entertainment value, reading would be a chore but it neednt be. Reading is not only fun, but it has all the added benefits that we have discussed so far. Much more enthralling than watching a movie or a TV show (although they have their many benefits as well), a good book can keep us amused while developing our life skills.

Russian doping appeals hit 60
PYEONGCHANG AFP Feb8, 2018
Thirteen more Russians joined the legal push to beat their country's doping ban and take part in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics on Thursday, taking the total number of appeals to 60 one day before the opening ceremony.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport, which was already dealing with 47 Russian appeals, said six athletes plus seven doctors, coaches and support staff had joined the list of last-ditch cases. The applicants are challenging the IOC's refusal to invite them to participate in the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic Winter Games, a CAS statement said.
They request that CAS overturn the IOC decision and allow them to participate in these Games. In December, the International Olympic Committee suspended Russia over a state-sponsored doping conspiracy culminating in its hosting of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.
But the IOC left open a loophole when it said a large group of clean Russian athletes could take part under a neutral flag as Olympic Athletes from Russia.
The CAS drew criticism last week when it lifted life Olympic bans imposed on 28 Russians. But when 15 of them applied to take part in Pyeongchang, the IOC refused to give them invitations.

SLC to make Rs. 1 billion net profit from Hero Nidahas Trophy
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) yesterday announced the successful tie up with several internationally reputed partners, thus making the Hero Nidahas Trophy 2018, a T20 Tri-Series, a tremendous commercial success estimating a net profit of Rs. 1 billion.
This is the first time since 2004, SLC solely went into the international market and secured partners to grant media and broadcasting rights of the Hero Nidahas Trophy 2018, directly to the respective territories (India and Bangladesh).
SLC also successfully secured partners for granting of ground sponsorship, advertisement and residual media rights of the tournament, which will kick start on 6 March featuring Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh.
Accordingly, DSports, a unit of Lex Sportel Vision Private Limited and Channel 9 of the ABL Group Private Limited was granted the Broadcasting and Media Rights for the Territory of India and Bangladesh, respectively. ITW Consulting Private Limited was awarded the ground sponsorship, advertisement and residual media rights of the upcoming tri-series.
We are happy to announce this event will bring in the highest viewership, listenership and the digital penetration for an event of SLCs own, thus further enhancing our brand in the global sporting stage, said Thilanga Sumathipala, president, Sri Lanka Cricket, speaking during the media briefing held at JAIC Hilton hotel yesterday.
In the meantime, Indian Automobile Manufacture, Hero Moto Corp. Ltd came forward as the title sponsor of the tournament. Hence, the tri-series will be known as Hero Nidahas Trophy 2018.
With all these internationally recognized partners coming in, this is going to be the most commercially successful tri-nation tournament organized by SLC. We expect to earn at least Rs. 1 billion in net profit out of this series, Sumathipala added.
In a bid to make this effort a success, SLC in mid-2017 appointed Lagardere Sports Asia, an international sports marketing agency as their international marketing consultant for the upcoming T20I Tri-Series.
The upcoming Tri-Series will see 3 countries playing seven (7) T20Is. The tournament will be played at the R. Premadasa International Cricket Stadium.

Sri Lanka bounce back as bowlers  dominate opening day
DHAKA: Sri Lanka hit back with four wickets after being bowled out for 222 as bowlers led by Bangladesh spinner Abdur Razzak dominated day one of the second Test in Dhaka on Thursday.
Razzak, making a Test return after four years, and fellow left-arm spinner Taijul Islam claimed four wickets each to wrap up the Sri Lankan innings shortly after tea.
Sri Lanka paceman Suranga Lakmal then picked up two wickets to leave the hosts tottering at 56-4 at stumps. Liton Das, on 24, and nightwatchman Mehedi Miraz, on five, were batting at close of play.
Lakmal drew first blood after taking a return catch off his own bowling to remove Tamim Iqbal for four in just the third ball of the Bangladesh innings.
But it was Mominul Haques run out in the very next over that left the hosts in trouble.
Haque, who scored centuries in both innings of the drawn first Test in Chittagong, returned without scoring.
Lakmal then bowled Mushfiqur Rahim for one before Dilruwan Perera ended the brief resistance of Imrul Kayes, who made 19.
Earlier the 35-year-old Razzak returned impressive figures of 4-63 to land the opening punch for Bangladesh after the visitors elected to bat first.
Taijul complimented Razzaks effort and claimed the final wicket of Roshen Silva, who made 56 after Kusal Mendis top-scored with 68 for the Sri Lanka.
Silva was involved in two dogged partnerships with Perera (31) and Akila Dananjaya (20) against a persistent Bangladesh bowling attack.
Razzak, who played the last of his previous 12 Tests in 2014, struck three times in the morning session including getting skipper Dinesh Chandimal for a first-ball duck.
Mendis brought up his 50 in 81 balls with a six off Taijul but Razzak rocked Sri Lanka with two wickets in two balls. -AFP

Ranked 60th in world among lowest in South Asia:
Sri Lanka scores low in budget openness
Sri Lankas budget openness, in the latest global survey, scored 44 out of 100, coming next to last in South Asia, tied with Pakistan. The latest Open Budget Survey released worldwide last week, scores 115 countries on the openness of their budget process. The survey is conducted every two years. The recent assessments of the 2013/14 and 2016/17 budget processes placed Sri Lanka 60th in the world and amongst the lowest ranked countries in South Asia.
Verit Research Executive Director Dr. Nishan de Mel explaining the influence of trade openness on economic growth via budget balances said that in the latest assessment, compared to the previous, Sri Lanka improved in the information provided each quarter, on revenue, expenditure and debt.
However, in the quality and timeliness of this information, Sri Lanka continued to fall short of many of its peers, he said.
SL needs higher standards
The open budget survey (OBS) is the worlds only independent assessment of information disclosure in public budgets. The recent assessments of the 2013/14 and 2016/17 budget processes have placed Sri Lanka 60th in the world and amongst the lowest ranked countries in South Asia.
In the latest survey, of the 2016/17 budget process, Sri Lanka scored 44 out of 100, coming in next to last in South Asia, tied with Pakistan. Afghanistan performed better than Sri Lanka, whereas Bangladesh did not, Verit Research revealed.
Assistant Analyst Nilangika Fernando said that the Open Budget Survey evaluates countries on three elements. It looks at the disclosure of budget documents, budget oversight and public participation in budget formulations and amendments to the budget. Countries are given a score out of hundred and they are then ranked.
Sri Lankas budget related reporting is governed by the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act (No. 3 of 2003). The government remains compliant with this law, despite falling short of international standards on the quality and scope of its budget reports.
De Mel said that we have seen from the past that Sri Lanka is capable of doing much better.
The survey shows that Sri Lanka has improved. But when it comes to public participation, Sri Lanka lags behind all other countries except Pakistan, taking our region into consideration, he said.
He further noted that budget oversight at Parliament level is seen to be weak because Parliament does not play a role in the formulation of the budget.
Similarly Sri Lanka does not publish a simplified citizens budget that enables members of the public to understand policies within the budget, he said.
Even though Sri Lanka has a Fiscal Management Responsibility Act, details are released in convoluted formats that are impossible to compare and understand by the average person. The government also retains significant discretionary power in allocating funds, especially for development activities under the National Budget Department.
Implementation misses the spirit of the Act, Dr. de Mel said. One of the main purposes of the Act is to increase public awareness of the governments fiscal policy and to establish standards for evaluating the governments conduct of its fiscal strategy. To achieve this, the Act requires the publication of the budget speech and the draft budget estimates, which are provided to Parliament. But neither of these achieves the expected outcome of being a comprehensible and adequate overview of the budget.
Verit Research emphasized the importance of publishing a comprehensible, non-technical budget document which is also known as a citizens budget.
The draft estimates are difficult to comprehend, spanning three volumes of about 500 pages each; and the budget speech focuses mainly on new expenditure proposals that cover less than 10 percent of the budgeted expenditure, leaving the rest opaque.
De Mel insisted on the need to provide budget related reports in a consistent format.
The reports should monitor the progress of budgetary outcomes and help decipher deviations. Towards that end, the government conforms to the law by publishing the required documents, he said.
However, the documents are in different formats with different levels of detail thus undermining the purpose of the Act.
For example, the budget estimates and appropriation bill present values under the administrative units and ministries. However, the mid-year fiscal position report and the fiscal management report do not include a breakdown of the administrative units, he said.
In the meantime, Verit Research highlighted the importance of publishing adequate information, in line with international standards.
The Act falls short in its requirements, said De Mel, explaining that the act requires the government to publish a mid-year fiscal position report that covers the first four months of the year and a second report that covers up to eight months of the year.
But there is no report that covers the full year in the same format.
This undermines comparability and scrutiny of the budget information. Neither does the Act require periodic updates of the budget or audit reports, which are integral to meeting international standards, he said. In past years Sri Lanka has performed better than in recent years, which points towards several of the above improvements being well within the scope of what is achievable in a short time-frame.
Recommendations
Improving Sri Lankas performance in budget openness requires alignment with international standards and requires the government to make two shifts: firstly, to go beyond the letter of the law and publish timely budget information in consistent formats. De Mel noted that the goal should be to enhance comprehensibility and comparability across documents. Secondly, to recognize the gaps in terms of budget information required by the law and publish adequate information that allows for the proper monitoring and scrutiny of budgetary outcomes and compliance.
He added that there are three simple ways in which Sri Lanka can improve, by going beyond the letter of the law and implementing the Act in terms of its intended purpose.
He emphasized that Sri Lanka should prioritize some actions to improve budget transparency.
Verit Research observed that a pre-budget report and an audit report have to be published online, citizens budget and a mid-year review should be published and there should be detailed data on the financial position of the government and increased information on performance and policy in the executives budget proposal. De Mel said that Sri Lanka also should focus on improving public participation in its budget process.
There should be mechanisms for members of the public and executive branch officials to exchange views on national budget matters during the monitoring of the implementation of the national budget. These mechanisms could build on innovations, such as participatory budgeting and social audits, he said.
He further noted that there should be legislative hearing on the formulation of the annual budget, during which members of the public or civil society organizations can testify. Establish formal mechanisms for the public to assist the supreme audit institution in formulating its audit programme and to participate in relevant audit investigations, he added.
The appetite for budget accountability has increased since the 2018 budget was presented to Parliament. Sri Lanka has legislation in place that allows for public scrutiny of budget information. But the shortfalls in implementation and the gaps in the requirements specified are resulting in the country coming out in poor light in international rankings on budget openness. In addition, the Ministry of Finance this year established a Budget Implementation Unit to oversee and monitor the implementation of the proposals in the 2018 Budget - whether they are successful remains to be seen.

Sublime Kohli guides India to crushing win
CAPE TOWN, Wednesday: Indian captain Virat Kohli hit 160 not out and led India to a third successive convincing win in the third one-day international against South Africa at Newlands on Wednesday.
India won by 124 runs to take a 3-0 lead in the six-match series. "We can't lose the series so that is a huge boost for the team," said Kohli. "Now we want to increase our intensity even more to close that door."
Kohli dominated India's total of 303 for six after the tourists had been sent in on a good batting pitch.
Needing to mount the highest successful run chase at the ground, South Africa fell woefully short. They were bowled out for 179.
Indian wrist spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav again bamboozled the South African batsmen, taking four for 46 and four for 23 respectively. The two spinners have taken a combined 21 wickets in the first three matches of the series.
"They're world-class spinners," admitted South African captain Aiden Markram. "After the third time we have played them the guys are still struggling to read the ball."
Markram gave credit to Kohli and the two spinners but added: "As much as they've played really well we've got ourselves to blame."
Kohli hit his second century of the series and the 34th one-day international hundred of his career. He has scored 318 runs in three matches and only been dismissed once.
It could have been different, though. He was given out leg before wicket to Kagiso Rabada before he had scored. Umpire Ian Gould had to overturn his decision when an ultra-edge replay showed a spike as the ball passed the bat.
"I didn't start off that well but it is another pleasing day individually and as a team," said Kohli, who said he was struggling with cramp when he was on about 95. "There are times when you are tested and it is pleasing to go through it and do well."
Kohli took a relatively sedate 119 balls to reach his 34th one-day international hundred, hitting only seven fours, but added another five fours and two sixes off 40 more balls in a blazing finish to the innings.
Kohli was content to play the supporting role in a second wicket stand of 140 with Shikhar Dhawan, who pounded 12 fours in making 76 off 63 balls.
The pair came together after Rohit Sharma was caught behind off Rabada in the first over without a run scored.
South Africa, already without three leading batsmen through injury, lost Hashim Amla leg before to Jasprit Bumrah in the second over. Markram and JP Duminy put on 78 for the second wicket before Markram was deceived by Yadav's second ball and was stumped to start a slide from which the hosts could not recover.

The public playground at Tangalle is on the verge of destruction due to lack of renovations and non-maintenance.It was declared open by the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2001 when he was the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development.
A part of the playground remains overgrown with shrub jungle.The area where the sports lovers have to sit and witness matches and other events is also dilapidated to a large extent.
The spectators get wet when it rains because the roofing sheets in certain areas of the roof remain broken. The playground is haunted by crows and doves and doves nets are seen all over the roof of the playground.

Telecom giant plans
Chinese telecommunication giant Huawei will spend 3 billion pounds ($4.2 billion) on British technology and services during the next five years, the company has announced.
Huawei is likely to spend the money in a variety of areas, including British telecom tech, chipset intellectual property and financial services from companies in the United Kingdom.
The new commitment comes after Huawei Chairwoman Sun Yafang met with Prime Minister Theresa May during the British leader's three-day visit to China.
We have now been working with our major customers in the UK for more than 12 years, helping to build a better-connected UK, Sun said. Over the coming years, we look forward to continuing to collaborate with our customers and partners to help keep the UK at the very forefront of the digital age.
In 2012, Huawei made a similar pledge to invest and procure 1.3 billion pounds in the UK over five years. Huawei announced on Monday that the company exceeded that target, investing 2 billion pounds during the period.
UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox called Huawei's announcement a significant vote of confidence in the UK's tech industry. I'm delighted to welcome their increased commitment to the UK, Fox said. With 90 percent of global growth forecast to come from outside the European Union, my international economic department is working to ensure Britain continues to benefit from the vast opportunities available as we leave the EU.
While the company is well-known globally for its smartphones, in the UK, Huawei has played a key role in installing and maintaining the last mile technology that delivers superfast broadband to around 20 million homes across Britain. (Chinadaily)

theatre for change: Moves on stage with humane touch
Hope is one of the strongest forces on earth, and hope is what Jehan Aloysius uses to free the mind through his vision which is CentreStage Productions. The Founder and Artistic Director of CentreStage Productions Aloysius, uses this hope which is within all of us, to make us dream that which may appear impossible and make it possible. Dramatic Moves features CentreStage Productions where self- belief transcends barriers.
"I first started directing way back in 1995. I did not have CentreStage productions as a name, but in 2001, I decided to establish my own theatre troupe, to focus on new writing for the stage. Our focus has always been on developing young writers, performers, directors and dramatists and really nurture those talents and to create a Sri Lankan identity in literature as well by creating new works, that can be taken to other countries," said Aloysius.
CentreStage also focuses on forum theatre and using theatre for social change - such as working with people affected by the Tsunami and the Civil War in Sri Lanka. So there is a vast amount of activity CentreStage has done.
"We also initiated the 'Stage Hands Project' which is my humanitarian arm. We use the proceeds from my plays to do our humanitarian work on a voluntary basis and we don't charge money. Every year we do one major humanitarian project last year for example we worked with victims of bullying and then the previous year we worked with the disabled. Those are some of the things we have been doing through Centre Stage," stated Aloysius.
It was the Sunera Foundation that invited him to work with the disabled soldiers during the war.
"I decided to work with Rana Viru Sevana and I started to formulate techniques for teaching as well as for performing these plays. When I work with the disabled and young people, you see the transformative nature of the process. Because of the loss of a limb and the lack of confidence - some of the soldiers felt ugly and deformed, they felt it was karma and they were ready to die at a certain age. And now they are travelling with choreographers and theatre practitioners around the world as performers," pointed out Aloysius.
Aloysius left his comfortable job in advertising to follow his dream of using theater for change. You may not be able to change the world but the scope and power of theatre is a really powerful tool, to open up the minds of the audience. The actors and actresses grapple with their individual issues and transform the communities.
"We did Tchaikovsky's 'Swan lake' and 'Nutcracker'. When we did 'Swan Lake' it became world news and featured on CNN and BBC. It became hugely successful. As a result of that, these soldiers were thrust into prominence. They soldiers said that even though they had lost a limb, because of the praise they received, they thought they had really done something," added Aloysius.
Aloysius maintains that he does not see the disability within people, but the ability that they have not identified - That they themselves are not ready to accept they have.
"Swan Lake featured Soldiers as well as people with various disabilities from Down Syndrome to the deaf. Even my 'Nutcracker' featured those performers. Ballet is dance and music, and you are working with soldiers who have lost both or one leg. The deaf cannot hear the music so you are working with visual cues and physical cues. If you take the musical 'Rag', it talks about University ragging and these issues are swept under the carpet for various reasons. People need to be reminded that this does exist. It is institutionalized bullying and it has been here for as long as we can remember. The absolute horror of ragging and ragging related violence and the vested interests people have in letting this continue is something we need to open peoples' minds to," explained Aloysius.
Aloysius's plays also deal with mental illness and child abuse. After the Tsunami the focus was on psychosocial development such as teaching children to play.
"So for this I worked with CARE, British Council and the National Child Protection Authority. We wanted to help children who have lost everything. I believe the universe conspires to send people to meet me and work with me. They get the opportunity to explore their full potential. They might have an issue they are grappling with. And it becomes a safe space to explore their full potential," added Aloysius.
'The Ritual' is another play which is important to Aloysius. It was shortlisted for the Gratiean Award. Aloysius was shortlisted for the Gratiean twice.
"I am also doing 'Pyramus and Thisby' which is a re- adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Midsummer Night's Dream'. I took the two smaller plots and made it into a fully- fledged out performance and I have set it in Sri Lanka in the early 1900's but used fusion music as well as contemporary elements to make it accessible. I used Shakespeare's text, dance, sinhala language and that play suddenly became a phenomenon. So it was performed numerous times. It received standing ovations by local and international audiences.
CentreStage will represent Sri Lanka at the Theatre Olympics in India showcasing Pyramus and Thisbe. The entire troupe numbering 15 will go to the Theatre Olympics," explained Aloysius.
Aloysius instantly identifies leaders because the stage is where leaders are born.
"I don't look at what you have done, I look at what I have, and what kind of opportunity I can give the person. It is up to you to embrace it and become a star. When I worked with soldiers without limbs I got them to do the most amazing things that they themselves couldn't believe they could do. Some of these soldiers had just lost their legs. They were still figuring out how to walk and here I was trying to make them dance," said Aloysius.
Actor Dion Nanayakkara, came from Kandy to Colombo in search of a theatre company to join and made the right choice joining CentreStage.
"I found CentreStage productions. I first joined the production 'Bengal Bungalow' for which I auditioned for a couple of roles. But as Jehan says, it is not the role you want, it is the role that is right for you. But I stayed on because I realized there was something in CentreStage which is quite different. After 'Bengal Bungalow' I became part of Jehan's core team in CentreStage productions," said Nanayakkara.
For him, it was a childhood passion that he achieved through CentreStage.
"I have always been into the Arts. Performing on stage is a thrill that you can't really quantify. Being on stage and being applauded is something which you can't measure. That element of performance is something I have wanted to be a part of ever since I was a child. In terms of drama there is always that thrill of playing someone else," stated Nanayakkara.
The highlight of his career is 'Rag'. That was his debut performance on the public stage as a public performer performing on CentreStage.
"In CentreStage we find there is always more to drama. In Rag it was not just the performance. It was the message that was given. We tell people about the important issues in society through a performance. So while you are entertaining them, you are educating them about what they need to know. It was an adventure. There was a lot of learning and a lot of emotions that went with it and there was a lot of passion from a lot of people that went into that production.
'Rag' was a very strong play in terms of what it did to the people who took part in it and also to whoever it spoke to. I played the role of Joseph which is the lead role. There are characteristics of Joseph that resonated with myself as a person. It was quite wonderful to play the role. There were a lot of things I had in common with the character," explained Nanayakkara.
Actor Kavishka Perera, a self-taught dancer had the moves, but CentreStage helped him become something much more.
"I actually walked into an audition for 'Rag'. I came in as a dancer. In my process throughout the drama, I realized that it was the ideal place for me. I have been into dancing and I am a self-taught dancer. All my skills were taken to a very different level with the training I got," said Perera.
He is quick to point out that what they learn at CentreStage is to be a human sponge.
"It is not only dancing but drama, singing and Acrobatics. It is a lot of learning when you are here. That is what kept me around. It is a lot of responsibility passed down from Jehan himself. Jehan helped me move forwards. And I gave it my best. I will be giving my best for CentreStage because I was made for this. I was initially a sportsperson and then I started dancing. Coming on stage happened in the latter part of school. And at some point I realized that the self -satisfaction we get through drama is much more than you can get from anything else," explained Perera.
Perera will soon have another achievement to be proud of as he will be going to the Theatre Olympics. "Through drama you entertain yourself, and you pass a message onto society and make a change in a person. If there is a possibility of changing one person's life, it is worth it. There is no greater satisfaction," said Perera.

Tourists warned of taking away banned items
Goods which have an archeological value and fauna and flora nearing extinction, are being spirited away by the tourists visiting Sri Lanka.
Making a statement to the Daily News regarding this issue, Deputy Customs Director and acting media spokesman of Sri Lanka Customs,Vipula Minuwanpitiya said items which have an archeological value and plants and trees and also animals threatened with extinction have been confiscated from foreigners leaving the country.
They have been confiscated under the Wildlife and the Flora and Fauna Act, the official said.
He called upon tourists and visitors to refrain from purchasing such items from local collectors or merchants.
Foreigners who purchase such items will be subject to unneccesary delays and hassle at the airport because they become victims of traders who sell such items, he said.
They realise that their money has been spent in vain once detected at the Customs desk. This will effect badly on the tourism industry as well, Minuwanpitiya said.
He said there is a gradual increase in the number of acts of bio-piracy in recent times with the number of detections increasing.
According to the Flora and Fauna Act, goods which have a historical value of more than 100 years including old books, carvings, brass items and also VOCplates, horns of deer and sambhur, star fish, Kothala Himbutu and the bark of the Wallapatta tree are banned from export and protected by the Wildlife and Flora and Fauna Act in Sri Lanka.

Vavuniya voyage
Title: The Vavuniya DiariesAuthor: Neville JayaweeraPublishers: Ravaya Publishers, Maharagama 2017Price:Rs250
This slim memoir spanning a few months in 1971 is noteworthy for its insider view on the failed first insurrection of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVPPeoples Liberation Front), or more exactly its repression somewhere remote from Colombo and the southwest, by a principal participant. The author was then Government Agent, that is the top-most administrative official, in undivided Vavuniya (before Mullaithivu had been carved from it).
This Tamil majority northern district was sprawling and forested and populated by poor peasants and wild animals. It was a punishment station away from the comforts of home, family and friends, for public officials out-of-favour with the incumbent government; and is variously described by Jayaweera as a jungle outpost, Siberia, and even gulag!
Their politically motivated transfer was to affect the loyalty and morale of police personnel and other state cadre as news of a daring bid for state power by a shadowy movement of Sinhala radical youth  known colloquially as Cheguara (through association with the image and example of the Argentine-Cuban revolutionary Ernesto Che Guevara)  trickled in from the Sinhala villages of Madukanda, Mamaduwa and Pavatkulama, to the town.
After his previous roles as Government Agent of Jaffna during the implementation of the Sinhala Only Act  narrated in his Jaffna: Exorcising the Past and Holding the Vision (Ravaya Publishers, 2014)  and as Chairman cum Director-General of the Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation, Jayaweera had anticipated measuring the length of his sentence in Vavuniya by purchasing paddy and looking into corruption in cooperative societies.
The eruption of armed rebellion from April 4, 1971 and until its eradication (in Vavuniya at least) by mid-August, changed the situation utterly.
Writ of the State
As Government Agent, Jayaweera was responsible for facing down the JVPs challenge and maintaining the writ of the state during those hot months. The defence of the town and its police station was critical.
The JVP strategy of a one-day revolution boiled down to storming police stations and arming themselves from their arsenal of weapons and ammunition; along with taking the political and administrative hierarchy up to prime minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike into captivity and possibly execution. Vavuniya town was an asset to both the state and the JVP for its location on the arterial road connecting Jaffna to Colombo and Mannar to Trincomalee and the rail-link between north and south.
Vavuniya police station came under attack on the night of April 4, lasting into the early hours of the next morning, until the rebels withdrew. Later on the 5th, Vavuniya town itself was besieged by between 100 and 150 armed men, vastly outnumbering the police. An infantry platoon from Mannar only arrived that afternoon.
As the reader can guess, the story that unfolds is of the successful resistance to the seizure of authority by the JVP, ending instead in the capture of its known supporters, and against all manner of worries. Aside from the constant threat to his life by the insurgents, these problems ranged from minimal support from a distant and panic-stricken central government  Felix Dias Bandaranaike, nephew and advisor to the prime minister, is a malevolent character in this drama  to a conspiracy against his own life from within the state security force.
However, the authors purpose lies elsewhere, setting this book apart from the recent crop of autobiographies by senior civil servants of yesteryear.
Make amends
In the twilight of a long and eventful life, Neville Jayaweera attempts to make amends for the loss of innocent lives on his watch; and to accuse an unjust socio-political and economic order of begetting the (wholly legitimate, in his view) reaction in the form of the JVP. Along the way, non-believers must endure a heavy dose of spirituality: for it was also in Vavuniya, in the midst of the turmoil outside and within him, that the author renewed his Christian faith.
A centrepiece of the book is to do with a 21-year-old man who had attended a couple of the JVPs political education classes, known as the Panthi Paha (Five Lessons). On the urging of his wife and accompanied by her and their infant child, he voluntarily surrendered himself to Jayaweera who assured his prompt release the following day, after interrogation by the army officer in charge of the local military unit.
The next morning the Sandhurst-trained captain announced that the individual had attempted to escape from his custody and been fatally wounded in the chase. As authorised under emergency regulations, his body was disposed of in the forest, burned on rubber tyres without magisterial inquiry and a coroners inquest. Sickened to his stomach, Jayaweera knew this chain of events to be a concoction. He movingly recalls the disbelief and anguish of the young wife, who had trusted in him, when he broke the news to her.
Upon inquiries from villagers, Jayaweera discovered that the army captain had made a sport of grilling holes in the palms of youth who were in some instances no more than ten years old, ostensibly for extracting information about rebel hideouts. At least 30 of those he had claimed to kill in combat, were unarmed youth who had been murdered.
He describes his swift action to have the captain and his unit removed from Vavuniya and to submit an inventory on the unlawful killings and missing persons in the district to his superiors in Colombo. Nevertheless, ...any attempt by me to launch even the most rudimentary investigations ran up against a stone wall of hostility and silence from the military.
No court martial of the captain took place, nor was any further action taken by the government on his report, likely because of the political embarrassment it would have caused. Whereas the government later claimed no more than 1,100 civilian deaths across the island; by Jayaweeras reckoning the true number was closer to 20,000.
Barrel of a gun
The author admits that ultimately, the state has to depend on the barrel of a gun, rather than on a moral code or even on the Courts of Law, to enforce its authority. However, he explains his exposure of these events, after almost half-a-century, because of the destructive effect on society of concealing such abuses. As people of integrity know, and as the subsequent decades in Sri Lanka tragically illustrate, impunity and non-accountability for gross crimes reproduce them in a cycle without end.
What is also surprising in an account by a former senior state administrator is his assessment of the JVP and its cause. The insurgents he says were drawn from a militant peasant group ... [that] sought to capture power in the name of a new social class...who had lived on the fringes of society for hundreds of years. The JVP was a systemic challenge. It threatened the whole system and for that reason, the entire system ... mobilised to defeat it.
His criticisms of the JVP appear to be not of its goal but rather its strategy and methods.
He points out that it had not mobilised the working class and the peasantry nor grasped the theory and practice of revolution. Both in 1971 and between 1987 and 1989, the JVP had embarked on an adventurist course, which he says not without reason, only consolidated the extreme right on both occasions.
He is sceptical of its current avatar. Parliament has been the graveyard of the JVP, he says, as it was earlier for the Old Left.
Unique addition
The Vavuniya Diaries is a unique addition to our understanding of the 1971 insurrection, the amateurishness of the JVP and the state alike, and the tensions of that time. Its promoters, Marshal Fernando and Susil Sirivardhana, are owed our appreciation for realising its release.
It would have benefited from stronger editing and closer attention to layout. The foreword could have been used to introduce the lay reader to the political dynamics of that period and the origins and ideology of the JVP in particular.
The initials JVP are repetitively mis-spelled as Jathika Vimukthi Peramuna, which was a political vehicle of the arch-racist K. M. P. Rajaratne, and no relation to the party founded by Rohana Wijeweera and his comrades. A state of emergency was declared on March 16th and not subsequent to the insurrection.
The author does not expand on a couple of intriguing asides. What were the tensions that sparked an assault on the police station in May 1971...by the army! How was the peaceful surrender of the remaining rebels in hiding achieved in August 1971 He is silent on the attitude and part of Tamils, who comprised 70 percent of the district, to the events he details. Were there any indications among Tamils of support for the nascent armed nationalist movement in the north
Neville Jayaweera resigned from the Sri Lanka Administrative Service and therefore as Government Agent of Vavuniya in early 1973. But not before he was subject to further harassment and threat of imprisonment by the Minister of Public Administration, Felix Dias Bandaranaike.
He was only 42-years-old. Shortly after, Jayaweera and his family left Sri Lanka and have lived ever since in England. He never returned to Vavuniya.

Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera bids farewell to the nation
Eminent Scholar monk and indefatigable campaigner for peace and reconciliation Most. Ven. Professor Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera bade farewell to the nation, including his Sangha fraternity and faithful devotees yesterday proving the Buddhist doctrine of impermanence of life he expounded.
Eminent Buddhist prelates, President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Ministers, Parliamentarians and other eminent persons were among the gathering present to bid farewell to the Most Ven. Thera.
Lakhs of people belonging to all communities, and religions earlier filed past the Ven.Theras remains to pay respects as it was kept at his abode, the Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya.
As the remains were taken to be placed in the Ranasivige to be taken in procession to the cremation grounds at the Sri Jayewardenepura University, cries of Sadhu Sadhu and Nivan Suwa Labewa raised by the gathering reverberated the Raja Maha Viharaya premises which was solemn and silent as a mark of respect to the Prelate.

Volunteer Teachers Union to boycott polls
The Volunteer Teachers Union in the Northern Province stated that they would boycott the elections on Saturday alleging that only a few of their members had been given permanent teaching appointments.
They submitted a letter to the Northern Province Governors Office on Wednesday (7) during a protest held in front of the Governors Office in Jaffna.
The Volunteer Teachers Union District President S. Indrakumar said there are close to 643 volunteer teachers serving in government schools in the North for over 10 years but only 182 of them have been selected to be given permanent appointments on February 15.
They observed that this was unfair and that they would boycott the upcoming polls in protest.
The union added that several graduates were included in the list of volunteer teachers who were not given permanent appointments.
The Northern Province Governor was not in his office during the protest. Thus, the protesters handed over the letter of demands to Northern Province Governors Office, Additional Secretary S. Selvanayagam.
The Governors Office had earlier issued a notice that 182 volunteer teachers and 142 teachers working on contract basis would be given permanent appointments at a ceremony held at Temple Trees on February 15.

Will Ice Prince Hanyu stay cool under pressure
GANGNEUNG : Japan's Ice Prince Yuzuru Hanyu must recover from serious injury and see off the challenge of American quad sensation Nathan Chen if he is to claim the first back-to-back Olympic men's figure skating titles in nearly 70 years.
The floppy-haired superstar alarmed his legion of fans when he damaged ankle ligaments in November, and has since been training behind closed doors.
All of Japan are willing on Hanyu, who is aiming to become the first man to secure back-to-back titles since American Dick Button in 1952.
The 23-year-old from Sendai is the polished product, combining innate technical ability with emotionally intelligent performances.
But the right ankle injury he suffered in November has seen his standing as favourite for a repeat gold slip.
He misses the team event, which kicks off action at the Gangneung Ice Arena on Friday, after completing his preparations at a secret location.
He will be 100 percent, promised coach Brian Orser, who also has two time ex-world champion Javier Fernandez under his wing.
Fernandez, the veteran Spaniard, narrowly missed out on a first podium in Sochi and arrives at his swansong Games in form after claiming a sixth consecutive European title in Moscow.
Chen, too, is flying. The Salt Lake City-born son of Chinese immigrants has emerged as a serious contender to Hanyu's crown with his high-risk, quad-heavy routine.
From October to December Chen won three Grand Prix competitions, defeating Hanyu along the way, before an emphatic triumph in the US championships last month.
Eighteen years we've been looking at the rings and now we're here. It's really cool to have that happen, said the excited 18-year-old on Wednesday.
Chen is the first skater in the history of the sport to line up five quads in a four-and-a-half-minute free dance routine. Others with claims to Hanyu's crown include his compatriot and world championship runner-up Shoma Uno, Canada's Patrick Chan and China's Jin Boyang. AFP
