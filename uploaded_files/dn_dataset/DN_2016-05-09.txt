Mother and Son born without Arms spread Hope with special Bond
A Chicago mother and son who were both born without arms are an inspiring testament to overcoming obstacles.
Linda Bannon, 37, and her son Timmy, who turned 11 on May 2, were born with Holt-Oram syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that causes abnormalities of the upper limbs and heart.
I think there's much more of a special bond between me and Tim than your average mom and son, Linda Bannon told ABC News today.
Although she was born without arms, Bannon said her parents never treated her any different from her four younger siblings who were not born with the disorder.
I was always expected to do chores and participate with the family activities like all the other kids, Bannon said. I just had to adapt and learn how to use my feet how other people use their hands.
When she was about 5 or 6 years old, Bannon was fitted for prosthetic arms at Shriner's Hospitals for Children in Chicago, but she preferred not to use them. Bannon thrived. She went on to receive a degree in elementary education and eventually married her husband Richard in 2004.
Soon after, the couple became pregnant. But like his mother, doctors said the baby would too be born without his arms.
Because they were looking at the presentation of no arms and the heart anomalies, they said that it was an indication of Holt-Oram syndrome, Bannon recalled. In the beginning, obviously it's kind of a shock. No parent ever wants to know that their child is affected with a condition thats going to alter their life. For, the most part, knowing I grew up this way, and I feel like my life was pretty good - I didnt have fears for him. The biggest fear was how serious his heart condition was. That was more concerning than his disability.
On May 2, 2005, Timmy was born. When he was 8 days old, he had open heart surgery and spent two months in the ICU. Now at 11 years old, Timmy is a typical boy - energetic and outgoing, his mother said.
Lately, he's been referred to as Mr. President because he likes to be out with people talking, Bannon said, laughing. He doesn't really shy away from social situations, so that how he's gotten that nickname.
He likes being outside, he definitely likes being very psychically active as much as he can be. Swimming, (riding) the modified bicycle - when we got that for him he was very excited because that meant he could keep up with everyone else on the trails she added.
The mother-son duo use their feet for everything - to brush their teeth, comb their hair, draw a picture and more. Timmy even uses his feet to play video games. Growing up, Timmy looked to his mother to show him how to improvise daily tasks by utilizing his lower limbs.
We laugh because as much as I try to help him, I'll say, You're doing it the hard way,' Bannon said. I think it's funny because I've already done the legwork, so why reinvent the wheel Thats been his personality since day one. One of our first doctor visits, I said, Timmy is just so stubborn. The doctor said, No way, you're kid is stubborn I guess the apple doesnt fall far from the tree.'
Sara Klaas, director of business development at Chicago Shriners Hospital said she and the staff at the facility have been working with the Bannon family since Linda was a child.
Over 30 years ago, Linda Bannon received our life-changing care and now, that same care and expertise are given to her son, Tim, Klaas said. Shriners Hospital for Children  Chicago is proud to touch generation after generation of children and families who need our world-class care..
Timmy and his mom first grabbed the world's attention six years ago, after Bannon shared their story with ABC Chicago.
Now, Bannon said she's willing to continue spreading the word of their journey, as long as it keeps inspiring others.
I think it really shows the power of the human spirit, she said.
A lot of people will see someone with such a severe physical condition and think, How is it possible to do all the things they've done It gives [people] hope that even though they have challenges, as long as they have a positive attitude about it, then they'll be able to conquer the same challenges.

Prince Oscar of Sweden Makes First Public Appearance
Prince Oscar of Sweden looked adorable in a blue bonnet and matching warmers as he made his first public appearance with his parents, Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel as well as his big sister Princess Estelle at the 70th birthday celebrations of his grandfather King Carl XVI Gustaf on Thursday. The baby prince was fast asleep throughout the festivities in his moms arms. He was joined by his family for the celebrations in Stockholm.
Baby Oscar, who is third-in-line to the Swedish throne after his mom and sister, was dressed in a blue bonnet complete with matching warmers and a pair of pale blue buckled shoes. He was wrapped up in a white blanket to protect from the cold weather. Oscar matched his sister completely in the all-blue outfit.
Four-year-old Estelle looked cute in a pale blue coat which she paired with white thigh high socks and matching pair of buckled shoes. The hyperactive royal wore her blonde locks down in a side part with a half up and half down braided do.
The stylish little princess sported one of the seasons biggest hair trends with her braided do.
Baby Oscars balcony appearance was in keeping with the tradition of the Bernadotte family. Even his sister Estelle made her public debut on the same balcony during the kings birthday four years before. Though it was her baby brothers debut appearance and her grandfathers big day, Estelle stole the show greeting clergymen as she left the royal chapel, shook hands and kissed cheeks with other royal guests. Later, she joined in musical tributes to the king, enthusiastically clapping her hands.
After Estelle and Oscar were put to bed, King Carl XVI Gustaf hosted a lavish banquet at the palace. The kings milestone birthday celebrations witnessed royal visitors from Japan, Spain, the Netherlands, Norway and Denmark.
He was joined by his family including older daughter Victoria and her family, son and new parents Prince Carl Philip and his wife Princess Sofia and his youngest daughter Princes Madeleine and her husband Chris ONeill who had flown down from their home in London.
His wife, Queen Silvia, was by his side as he celebrated the momentous occasion.

Rooted in history
Sakkarang' (Hospitality) is one of the finest films produced by Cine Sarasavi and an extraordinary film by veteran Dr. Dharmasena Pathiraja. It is a film about a village and its villagers in the up-country during the 18th century.
The king, the ministers and chieftain i.e. traditionally called as nilames, the clergy, and the ordinary people of the village are all bonded with each other. The king and the clergy, the ministers, and the Kandyan chieftains are all honouring each other not as a rule of law, but in the rich culture they are born and bred.
The village of Malagammama is not a feudal society, because they are a disciplined and cultured social group who knows their place in the society. For example the village chief dancer and drummer (Sube) bows his head to the chieftain (Nilame) as he knows the position he holds in the social context. Sube (Bimal Jayakody portrays this character quite satisfactorily.) knows his place in society. As the chief of a social group of dancers and drummers Sube has mastered his craft! Thats not all. He has rituals of his profession plus he is a healer through his charms and also a physician with a capability. All in all Sube is a social figure with rich cultural roots. The Kandyan chieftains also admire his skills in these matters.
The film's opening sequences establishes this social phenomenon well! When they are coming after a ritual, the chief is in the forefront, like an ant line they walk in a row according to seniority. When they depart they say good bye to each other with a disciplined bow of the head.
Healthy society
So I wonder how the westerners define it as a feudal society. There is unity, integrity and disciplined cultural inter-relationships which is a basic feature of a healthy society. We dont see any discrimination among them. Its a well rooted cultural society.
The Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Tooth Relic) has given each and every family of drummers and the dancers a plot of land to cultivate and to live in. It is only a bond. There is no individual land ownership but with advent of the British rule, things are taking a sudden turn in this social set up. Money is becoming the prime source of the buying and selling economy. In this social context Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy, the eminent scholar and academic, mentioned about this social phenomenon in one of his greatest books 'Medival Sinhalese Art'. In the film 'Sakkarang' too, the same social conflict has arisen in a very well made film art work.
The cinema students must observe and refer to the film 'Sakkarang' as reference material. The film has a very artistic colour tone. Kudos to director Dr. Dharmasena Pathiraja and, of course, the director of photography, Donald Karunaratna. This is quite different from the artificial and glamarous colour tones used by North and South Indian films.
Compared to the Pathis earlier films like 'Ahas Gawwa', 'Bambaru Evith', 'Eya Den Loku Lamayek' and 'Soldadu Unnehe' ('Ponmani' the Tamil film made by him too should be included in the list) the vigour and forceful presentations are not present in the film 'Sakkarang'. Unlike in my youth, maturity with long years of studying Dr. Pathiraja's work, an analytical study of his film style needs to be done.
Apart from the technical points, Dr. Pathirajas film is a rare treat for the audience. There are only good films and bad films! as the saying goes. 'Sakkarang' is a film that makes you sit and admire the story unfolding on screen.
Rare opportunity
The social thinking in the films he has made so far is a live wire for an awakening among our film audience. Its up to the film audiences to watch the movie with mind and heart. The film is made to fill the vacum of entertainment today what a rare opportunity it is indeed!
The culture, behaviour patterns, mannerism and, of course, a civilized society, which we can be proud of is portrayed in 'Sakkarang'. The Sri Lankan Sinhala Society is rooted on very rich cultural roots. We felt it when we saw the film 'Sakkarang'. Compared to western civilizations, its value did not depend on monetary gains! It was giving and getting which goes hand in hand with the Buddhist Principal.
'Sakkarang' is produced by H.D. Premasiri (for cine Sarasavi). It challenges the audience as well as the film makers style.
Will they be encouraged by the state or the ruling government to take steps to promote films of this nature will they turn a deaf ear to the matter Only time will tell.
Sakkarang re-reads history and re-thinks social strata. It tries to awaken the cultural roots of our heritage. Through Western eyes it is not visible, but if you analyse the whole social set - up; its a pride of a nation that is portrayed. Its not a primitive society. Its our ancestral society. Its a complete social structure to honour each other and to obey to each other. They were rich in thinking. One who tries to ruin or tries to enagage in destructive activities may have unexpected consequences! Pathiraja always emphasizes this awakening in most of his films. Every society may change, but the cultural roots must prevail!

Practical politics!
Title: Law of Elections
Author: Dr. Jayatissa De Costa, Presidents Counsel, Former Principal, Sri Lanka Law College
Most readers of Dickens are familiar with his description of a Parliamentary election at which both candidates appeared at the hustings and faced a mob of their supporters and opponents, while rival newspapers poured the heartiest abuse on each other.
Britain has moved a long way from those days. British general elections are of the most decorous kind. Sometimes around 1950 Winston Churchill, whose long political experience entitled him to speak with authority spoke of the general election held that year as the most genteel and orderly election in the countrys history. That was sixty six (66) years ago.
Although in Sri Lanka candidates seeking election to Parliament, Presidency, Provincial Councils Municipal Councils, Urbans Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas do not have to answer as many questions or strive with hecklers as in Britain the emphasis here still remains on the personal touch; candidates themselves call on housewives, pat babies on the head, tickle children under the chin and generally try to spread an atmosphere of goodwill. Individual voters still relish these pressing attentions at election times.
Viewed, however, from the standpoint of undue influence, corruption, general intimidation and other vitiating factors recent experience has shown that Dickens description of an election in Britain is still relevant to Sri Lanka.
In Dr. Jayatissa De Costas own words If one compares the position in Sri Lanka with that of England, one will observe that elections were very corrupt in England in the 19 th century and the early part of the 20 th century. Accordingly there were a large number of election petitions in that era. However, today in England elections are conducted without corrupt or illegal practices and for the past 90 (ninety) years there were only a handful of disputed elections in England.
Dr. De Costa has therefore, rendered a useful service by publishing a work on the Law of Elections. Little ink has been spilt, even badly on the law of elections in our country. Two earlier works which dealt with this subject were the Law of Parliamentary Elections in Ceylon by S.E.J. Fernando (1947) and the Law of Parliamentary Elections by R. Weerakoon (1970). These were mere handbooks for the guidance of busy candidates and cannot in any way be treated as dealing with the subject with any degree of thoroughness. Besides they were published before 1970. In the period after 1970 however, momentous and far reaching constitutional changes have taken place in the country leaving a vital lacuna in the earlier publications. Dr. De Costa has done more than necessary to fill this vital gap.
The author deals with the main features of our election law beginning with its early evolution packing it with all the material which is necessary to give the reader an accurate and complete impression of the rather complicated election law in Sri Lanka.
This comprehensive work is remarkable for its conciseness. The major events, periods, election offences and the case law are handled with clarity. The mass of material has been so admirably simplified that the reader can get a clear grasp of the law relating to Elections in all its aspects.
The historical development of the elective principle in Sri Lanka, the proportional representation, nominations, conduct of the poll, a general introduction to the election offences, personation, treating, undue influence, bribery, false statements, illegal practices, Presidential Elections, Provincial Council elections, local authority elections, referendum, election petitions and agency are discussed and one can form a picture of how Sri Lanka has drawn on all the experiences of other parliamentary democracies and shaped her own legal concepts, structure and scheme.
The procedure in election petition cases which obviously deserves careful study is discussed in chapter 16. As has been judicially observed once an election petition is presented the matter ceases to be one exclusively between the petitioner and the respondent. In fact it becomes a matter in which the whole electorate, not to say the whole country has an interest and any order disposing of the application should therefore be made from the largest point of view (Nagalingam J. in Don Alexander vs. Leo Fernando 49 N.L.R 202).
Agency an important aspect of election law is discussed in chapter 17 where principles such as vicarious liability are dealt with to shed light on the operation of the concept of agency.
In this book Dr. De Costa has amassed a wealth of material both from Sri Lanka and abroad, particularly from England and India. Therefore practising lawyers will find in the book a ready reference to leading cases on Election Law.
Since the author has introduced a comprehensive element into the treatment of the subject and has explained the practical operation of the several relevant principles of law, students of law will immensely benefit from it.
Although this book is essentially meant as a legal research the author has not confined his studies to an analysis of the technical rules either substantive or procedural. The author tries to look at the election law in actual operation and to assess the electoral system in Sri Lanka in terms of practical politics. In the result, the approach that has been adopted by Dr. Costa is one that of a constitutional lawyer as well as that of a political scientist.
Election law is very complicated and undergoes many changes periodically. The author has dealt with the statutory provisions and the decided cases up to March 2016. This is a book which the author must have taken several years to write and it can be called a standard work on this difficult branch of our law which is a very valuable work that will greatly help judges, lawyers and students of law in this difficult field of law.

Chrysanthemum care
Chrysanthemum is considered the most popular cut flower in many parts of the world. As a cut flower, it has a long vase life. It is a beautiful flower that has a huge range in variety. The name chrysanthemum is derived from the Greek words chrysos (gold) and anthemon (flower). Garden Talk talks to Lassana Flora Chairman/ Managing Director Dr. Lasantha Malavige about this flower that is celebrated in many parts of the world.
They are mostly found in South East Asia and in North East Europe. China also became a major hub for a variety of chrysanthemums and it was later introduced to Japan. In the 17th century, it was introduced to the United States, he said.
Chrysanthemum flowers commercially available as cut flowers are patented hybrid varieties. These varieties have been created to increase beauty, resist disease and improve vase life. Lassana Flora works with two of the worlds leading chrysanthemum breeders and currently produces over 40 varieties of highbred chrysanthemums in Sri Lanka. Lassana Flora has entered into licensing agreements with Dutch breeders to locally propagate from mother plants, said Malavige.

The appeal of chrysanthemums lies in its durability as a cut flower. In the case of other flowers such as orchids and dahlias, it is a favourite among horticulturists because there are many varieties to choose from.
Chrysanthemums have a long vase life as opposed to most other cut flowers. It belongs to the family Asteracaea. Its main difference to other flowers is its range. It has sprays (clusters of flowers), single flowers, pompoms and spiders. These main varieties are different to each other. The ideal day temperature for chrysanthemums is Celsius 20  27 and the night temperature is Celsius 12  20. In Sri Lanka, such whether conditions are available in altitudes over 1,000 metres, pointed out Malavige.
Chrysanthemums are grown in parts of the world with controlled settings. It is a short day plant. It needs a short day and a long night for flowering.
It starts flowering during a shorter day or longer night. In commercial cultivation, we increase the daytime with artificial light to delay flowering and increase the height of the stem. If the day is not extended, it would start flowering when the plant is small. By providing artificial light, we deceive the plant so that it keeps growing, explained Malavige.
It can be grown from seeds or from cuttings. Commercial production is always from rooted cuttings. Cuttings are obtained for rooting from mother plants. It takes about 90 days to flower after planting the rooted cuttings. As soon as it is properly flowered, the plant is uprooted and the stem is obtained as a cut flower for sale. But if it is a garden flower, it can be kept longer. Chrysanthemums can be grown as a hobby as a potted plant or as a garden plant.
Cut chrysanthemums under ideal conditions have a vase life of two weeks. Maintaining flowers in clean water is important. If you do not change water, there could be bacteria and other pathogens growing that can block the water circulation from the bottom of the stem to the flower. So it is important to keep the water clean and change water every other day. Each time you change water, you must clean the vase with a detergent, maintains Malavige.
In higher humidity, it is susceptible to White Rust and other fungal infections. In Sri Lanka, a common disease is White Rust. Other fungal infections include Bothrites and Downy Mildew. It can be affected by insects such as mites and aphids. Good hygienic conditions need to be maintained to avoid White Rust. If the plant is infected, remove those plants as other plants can be affected. There are a lot of fungicides that can be used. Insect nets can be used. There are also poly tunnels where polythene covers the top and insect nets on the sides.
It seems that chrysanthemums are not merely for the eyes or visual pleasure, but also satisfy our taste buds as well.
Chrysanthemums are used for culinary purposes. The most popular is chrysanthemum tea. It is sometimes added to wine. In Korea, chrysanthemums are added to rice wine to obtain a good flavour. Sometimes the petals of some varieties are used for salads. But they are grown under different conditions with the minimal use of insecticides or pesticides, said Malavige.
TIPS ON GROWING CHRYSANTHEMUMS
It is a short day plant. It will flower early unless lighting is provided
It may never flower if the potted plant is placed under street or garden light
In commercial cultivation, a plant support net is used to make sure it does not fall on its side. The flowers also like air circulation.
FUN FACTS ABOUT CHRYSANTHEMUMS
In Australia, the chrysanthemum is sometimes given to mothers for Mother's Day
In Italy, chrysanthemums traditionally represent death and are often placed on a person's tombstone. However, In the United States, the flower is usually regarded as positive and cheerful
In China, it is one of the four symbolic seasonal flowers symbolising nobility.
Tutankhamen was buried with floral collars of chrysanthemum
In Japan, the chrysanthemum is a symbol of the Emperor and the Imperial family. The Chrysanthemum Throne is the name given to the position of Japanese Emperor and the Throne.

## Title: How to have a long producing vegetable garden

How to have a long producing vegetable garden
Keeping your vegetable plants healthy is the first key to a long producing vegetable garden. But even the healthiest vegetable plants will finally exhaust themselves setting fruits and will need replacing. Eventually it will be time to put the garden to bed, but keep it going as long as you can. With a little planning, you can easily keep your vegetable garden producing in succession.
Here are some simple, but key factors for a long producing vegetable garden.
1. Keep Picking:
Don't give up and leave those over ripened zucchini on the vines. Once a plants fruits have gone to seed, it thinks it is done for the season and begins to decline. Many plants, like squash, beans, peppers and eggplant, will stop producing new vegetables if the existing veggies are left on the plants to fully ripen.
2. Water Regularly:
Vegetables don't just need water, they need regular, consistent watering. Irregular watering results in problems and diseases like blossom end rot and cracking and can often make the vegetables bitter tasting. Allowing plants to dry out will stress the plant and cause it to stop producing and to drop whatever blossoms it already has.
3. Control Insects and Diseases:
Stop problems while they are small. Plants can defoliate from fungus diseases and a plant with no leaves is not going to produce fruit.
4. Feed Lightly:
You've asked a lot from your vegetable plants and they could use a little food by mid-summer, no matter how rich your soil is. But feed them lightly, especially with nitrogen. Too much nitrogen will encourage a lot of leaf growth and inhibit fruit production.
5. Let the Sun Shine In:
Make sure the vegetables are getting enough sunlight. Sometimes by the middle of summer, there is so much foliage that the sunlight can't get through. Most vegetables ripen faster in sunlight and produce tastier fruits. Vegetables that languish in the shade of leaves are more susceptible to insects and diseases.
6. Weed:
It's easy to let things slide toward the end of summer, but weeds will compete with your vegetable plants for water and nutrients, just when they need it most.
7. Succession Plant:
Planting crops at intervals will renew your garden by having new plants ready to take over for spent plants. Beans, radishes and lettuce can be seeded every two weeks, for an almost endless supply. Seedlings of early maturing tomatoes can be planted to replace plants that are on their last legs.
9. Extend the season:
Cool nighttime temperatures send a signal to many plants to stop producing new fruits. If cool temperatures or a frost are inevitable, cover your crops with floating row covers. These light-weight woven fabric allow light and water to come through, but raise the temperature slightly. If your crops need to be fertilized by insects, the row covers should come off during the day.
10. Share the Bounty:
With any luck and a bit of work, you'll probably have more vegetables than you can use (or drop off on your neighbor's porch when they're not looking). (Gardening)

Your blood life
Dr Sachith Mettananda, MBBS(Col) DCH(Col) MD(Paed)(Col) DPhil(Oxon) Lecturer and Consultant Paediatrician Faculty of Medicine and North Colombo Teaching Hospital, Ragama speaks about Thalassemia, one of the preventable, incurable and manageable (with life long blood transfusion and medical treatment) diseases which affect a human being for his/her life time while putting an unbearable financial and mental burden for the parents of the patient.
Q: What is Thalassaemia
Lecturer and Consultant Pediatrician Faculty of Medicine and Ragama North Colombo Teaching Hospital Dr Sachith Mettananda.
A: Thalassaemia is a disease of blood which results in profound destructions of red blood cells. In humans, oxygen is carried around the body by the molecule known as haemoglobin which is found inside red blood cells. Hemoglobin is composed of two types of proteins which are known as alpha-globin and beta-globin.
In thalassaemia, production of beta-globin protein is reduced and this reduction leads to continuous premature destructions of red blood cells within the bone marrow (the site where all blood cells are produced) and within circulation.
Destruction of red blood cells compromises the bodys ability to supply oxygen to its organs which leads to symptoms of thalassaemia.
Thalassaemia is genetically transmitted and the gene responsible is beta-globin gene. All humans have two beta-globin genes (each inherited from either parent) and individuals with thalassaemia have mutations (abnormalities) in both beta-globin genes.
Q: How about symptoms and diagnosis
A: Children with thalassaemia are perfectly normal at birth. These infants begin to show symptoms of thalassaemia around six months of age. As already mentioned, red blood cells of these babies are destroyed which leads to the clinical state known as anaemia (i.e. not enough haemoglobin in the body).
Patients with thalassaemia develop symptoms of anaemia such as paleness (pallor) of the body, feeding difficulties, poor weight gain, difficulty in breathing and lethargy. In addition the liver and the spleen are enlarged and these kids will have changes in bones which include bossing of the forehead and prominence of cheek bones.
The diagnosis of thalassaemia is straight forward and can be done through few blood tests. Full blood count (FBC) test will show low haemoglobin level and the blood film (blood picture) will demonstrate smaller and less haemoglobinised red blood cells with some abnormal cells.
The definitive diagnosis is made through Haemoglobin HPLC which is freely available in thalassaemia centres (eg: Kurunegala, Ragama, Anuradhapura and Badulla) around the country.
Q: What are the treatments available in Sri Lanka at the moment
A: Blood transfusion is the only routinely available treatment for thalassaemia at present in Sri Lanka. Children with thalassaemia need regular monthly blood transfusions to keep the amount of haemoglobin at safe levels and to sustain life. In addition, patients with thalassaemia are at increased risk of iron overload and iron deposition in body organs therefore, requires treatment to remove excess iron from the body.
Currently three iron chelating medications are available, namely desferrioxamine, deferasirox and deferiprone. All these medications are given free of charge to all the patents with thalassaemia in Sri Lanka. Despite treatment patients with thalassaemia develop numerous complications therefore, invariably have a reduced life expectancy and a poor quality of life.
The only cure for thalassaemia is bone marrow transplantation and has been performed in a limited number of patients in private hospitals in Sri Lanka. However, even in developed countries, bone marrow transplantation is only available to a minority of patients who have suitable donors.
Q: How can we prevent Thalassemia
A: Thalassaemia is a preventable disease. As already mentioned, thalassaemia occurs when a child inherits two mutated (abnormal) beta-globin genes from his/her parents. The parents of patients with thalassaemia are healthy and normal as only one (out of two) beta-globin genes are mutated (abnormal). Those individuals who has only one mutated (abnormal) beta-globin gene are known as thalassaemia carriers. A patient with thalassaemia could only be born to a couple who are both thalassaemia carriers. The best way to prevent thalassaemia is by stopping marriage between two thalassaemia carrier adults or not giving birth to children if two thalassaemia carriers decide to get married. Such couples should only adopt a child from another family if they badly need a baby.
It is estimated that 2.5% of Sri Lankan population (500,000 people) are carriers for thalassaemia.
Fortunately, thalassaemia carrier state can be easily identified by simple blood tests which includes FBC and haemoglobin HPLC test. These tests can be done free of charge at any thalassaemia centre in the country. It is advisable that every young adult get tested for thalassaemia carrier state before marriage. If an individual is free of abnormal thalassaemia gene there is no restrictions in finding the partner. If one is found to be carrying an abnormal thalassaemia gene (thalassemia carrier) he/she should be careful to select a partner who is not a thalassaemia carrier. If a thalassaemia carrier individual marries a non-carrier individual, there is no risk of having children with thalassaemia. In this way, by stopping marriages between two thalassaemia carriers, birth of children will thalassaemia can be prevented and the disease can be eliminated.
* Thalassaemia is a preventable disease
* The best way to prevent thalassaemia is by stopping marriage/child births between two thalassaemia carrier adults
* If one partner is found to be carrying an abnormal thalassaemia gene (thalassemia carrier) he/she should be careful to select a partner who is not a thalassaemia carrier.
* If a thalassaemia carrier individual marries a non-carrier individual, there is no risk of having children with thalassaemia
* It is advisable that every couple get themselves tested for thalassaemia carrier state before starting courtships / marriage or at least before getting pregnant.
* Thalassaemia carrier state can be easily identified by simple blood tests which includes FBC and haemoglobin HPLC test. These tests can be done free of charge at any thalassaemia center in the country.

Review of SLCs Womens U23 Provincial Tourney
Sri Lanka Cricket in one of their talent-exploration missions with a view to unearthing the hidden talent especially among the upcoming young women cricketers in the island organized a short-three-day provincial tournament for women players of U23 age-category naming the three Provincial-teams which participated as Olu, Nelum and Manel.
In this tournament which was played on 25th, 26th and 27th of April, the three provincial teams concerned played each other in three matches at two venues, MCA and Maththegoda grounds. All three matches were of one-day duration subject to a maximum of 100 overs per match with each team playing two innings.
Despite the fact that no matches produced any positive results, Olu and Nelum recorded first-innings wins whilst Manel being a contestant in the only match that ended in no-result lost the other match they played against Olu failing to record a win of any sort in this short tournament. The opening match of the tourney was a low-scorer, but the next two showed certain progress as far as the batting was concerned.
Former all-rounder of Devapathiraja College-Rathgama, Sathya Sandeepani (Manel) who played also for North Central Province U26 side topped the tournaments batting list with a tally of 94 runs at an average of 94, the highest in the tourney with former Teldeniya NS player, Harshani Wijeratne (79 runs) and Matara SC player, Malsha Shehani (78 runs) both of Olu following. Harshni Wijeratnes 73-ball 62 against Manel was the tournaments highest individual total.
In the bowling, Madushika Mettananda of Nelum captured a total of 8 wickets at a healthy average of 7 and an amazing economy of 1.87 to become the top-wicket taker of the tourney with 5 for 21 being her and tournaments best innings analysis.
Malsha Shehani of Olu who was the third in the batting list finished with tournaments best all-round display occupying the second spot in the bowling list with 7 wickets to her credit.
Malsha also was one of just two players in the tournament to complete a five-for with the ball. Sachini Sewwandi also of Olu finished third in the bowling list bagging 4 wickets at an economy of 1.67 which was the best in the tournament.

NWP Under 19 and SP Under 19 book final berths
Two unbeaten teams, North Western Province U19 and Southern Province U19 overcoming the challenge of three Western-Province teams qualified to play in the finals of U19 Inter-Provincial Tournament 2016 after they became the best two teams in their respective groups, point wise. These two teams will clash with each other in the three-day finals to be played at R Premadasa Stadium starting on May 10.
Both finalists needed at least a first-innings win in their last group matches, which surprisingly happened to be with their closest rivals in the points table, in order to retain their top positions. Group A leader, NWP had an advantage of 9.855 points over second placed WPN whilst difference between SP and WPS in Group B was 7.14 in favour of SP prior to the last round of group matches.

This was a very tricky situation for the group leaders especially for SP as just a first-innings win would have been sufficient for their opponents to push them to the second slot. However, both NWP and SP claiming first-innings points in their last group matches over WPN and WPS respectively on Saturday secured their places in the finals without a serious challenge from their opponents though Southerners were given an unsuccessful fight by WPS towards the latter part of the match with a view to regaining their lost pride.

## Title: Giving electronic media the power with responsibility

Giving electronic media the power with responsibility
A recent news item revealed that the Government is considering the establishment of an independent authority to regulate electronic media in the near future. A government official, commenting on the matter, stated that this authority will be established with the consent of all industry stakeholders.
Our Constitution provides for freedom of speech and expression, including for members of the media, and the government generally respected these rights. Today, our print media are self-regulated. The Internet has also gone unregulated, despite concerns about some controversial content. Electronic media, which mainly consist of radio and television broadcasters must obtain a license from the government because, according to our law, the public owns the airwaves. Other than that, they are also expected to regulate themselves.
Self-regulation in the press mainly takes the form of journalistic codes of practice for accuracy and fairness plus some procedures for implementation. Self-regulation also tends to deal with privacy issues, the protection of journalistic sources and standards in advertising.
The means of accountability are typically voluntary and non-punitive. They are 'policed either within and by the media organization itself or by some intermediate body representing public and industry interests.
The need
Given such a scenario, one might ask whether we really need a mechanism to regulate electronic media. Few questions have to be answered and sorted out first before we find out the answer.
According to some research sources, the key reason behind bringing an independent regulatory mechanism for electronic media derives from the claims made against them by the public and other critics on grounds of failing to meet expectations of the public and also actually causing various kinds of harm to the society. These claims are usually resisted by a section of electronic media because they interfere with their own claims to free expression and their commercial objectives.
At this point, it may be feasible for us to identify what exactly common citizens expect from the electronic media. In the opinion of the writer, the main issues of primarily public concern are, (1) maintaining respect for public values in matters of taste and decency, (2) achieving benefits for the public sphere in terms of balanced information flow, access, diversity and public participation, (3) maintaining cultural standards and supporting the national or regional culture and language, (4) respecting human rights of expression and protection from insult and prejudice, (5) preventing harm to society, especially by way of harm to children and young people from undesirable content.
Have the Sri Lankan electronic media managed to meet these aspirations during the past few decades Its doubtful whether they did. This observation is not exclusive to Sri Lanka but prevails in many countries, even in the developed world.
Regulation
That is why, radio and television broadcasting are subject to certain levels of regulation, in over 150 countries, both developing and developed, have some type of electronic media regulatory mechanisms. In those countries, the general concept of social responsibility and public interest lies at the core of the broadcasting model, although there are several variants, such as weaker (as in the USA) or stronger forms (as in Europe).
The electronic media model covers two main types of system. One is the public service variant, the other consists of privately owned. In a fully developed form, public service broadcasting generally refers to five main features, which are supported by policy and regulation. One is the provision of a full service to all. A second is that the system should be financed by payments from all citizens or, as in the UK, all receiving households (not just the consumers of the service). Thirdly, there is public control of access to broadcasting channels, in greater or less detail, to ensure fairness, political neutrality, and independence from vested interests and from the state.
Fourthly, a public broadcasting service is democratically accountable to the nation. This is usually achieved by way of parliamentary control of financial allocations. Fifthly, a public broadcasting service seeks to achieve various goals of quality of service. The regulation of public broadcasting makes it accountable to the public and to society rather than to owners, or the market.
Privately owned commercial broadcasting systems, in contrast, are free to choose their own objectives, in the sense of whichever consumer audience or advertising market they want to serve. However, they are subject to licensing conditions and public scrutiny. Their primary accountability is to owners, investors and clients. Regulation in this case is essentially restrictive and is designed to establish the ground rules and set limits within which the systems operate. These ground rules mainly concern the matters such as: permitted amount and content of advertising; control of other means of finance (e.g. sponsorship); content potentially harmful to the young or causing offence to some value or group (e.g. in matters of racism, or religious blasphemy); procedures for complaints and rights of reply.
Privately owned commercial broadcasting systems often have to meet certain minimum standards as a condition of receiving a license or operating concession. These conditions often relate to such matters as provision for education, news and information, local language or culture, political or other access opportunities, minority needs.
Forms of regulation
In many developed countries, the forms of regulation are diverse, but there is a certain standard pattern. Such laws state broadly the goals of the system and who or what bodies are eligible to operate as broadcasters and under what conditions. For instance, some countries forbid or limit foreign ownership and, many have rules forbidding cross-ownership between press and broadcasting. In some European countries political or religious organizations are not allowed to own and operate broadcasting stations.
More detailed terms and conditions may also be set down in license and franchise agreements, which will be periodically renewed, revised and, if necessary, can be revoked. Broadcasting laws often contain content-related regulations, for instance requiring a balance between different kinds of content (especially information and entertainment) or requiring a certain amount of home production or transmission in the national language.
Laws of this kind are the province of parliaments. There will often be a Ministry or other Department of government which has the responsibility for their formulation - for example, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (in Britain), or the Ministry of Communications (in France).
However, there is usually another thick layer of administrative machinery between government and the actual broadcasting organizations which can serve as a two-way link and, in certain cases, help to preserve the independence of broadcasting from direct government interference. This link is increasingly formed by powerful regulatory agencies which have an oversight over different media organisations. In Britain, for instance, we find the Office of Communications (Ofcom), in France the ConseilSuperieur de l'Audiovisuel (CSA), in Sweden the Broadcasting Commission, in Holland the Commissariat for the Media, in the USA the Federal Communication Commission (FCC).
There may also be a few additional bodies (both statutory and voluntary) that represent the interests of viewers and listeners, whether as consumers or citizens and keep up pressure for enforcement of rules and for expressing complaints.
Tiered and platform-specific
This writer believes that the need of the hour is to create a robust regulatory mechanism for electronic media that is two-tiered and platform-specific. The first tier should be within the media organisations -an ombudsman type to be appointed by the Government. This will give a chance for a listener or a viewer to get relief and recompense without going through the time and resource consuming legal path.
Tier two should be at the national level and be an independent regulatory authority that takes an active role in promoting high standards, including having the power to investigate serious breaches and slap sanctions. It should have a legal underpinning to make it binding.
The authority should come out with clear implementable and binding codes that provide an effective complaint redress mechanism and its enforcement. The first tier of regulations should focus on course correction rather than being punitive in its approach. There should also be space for arbitration to resolve most of the issues. The idea of arbitration is to make the redress system accessible to the general public both in terms of costs and time. The legal recourse, in the event of unsatisfactory outcome during the arbitration, should be at the level of the High Court.
The regulatory body should also be backed by systems designed to assess whether it is doing its job properly. Finally the authority must attempt an effective method to incorporate suggestions from different quarters and disciplines in order to come up with a set of rules that do not prioritise one element of freedom at the cost of others.

Diagnose early and reverse the impossible
Part I
The water problem in Sri Lanka was known before the nations independence from the British in the mid-20th century. In the past few decades, water-related issues in the north central province (NCP; formerly known as Rajarata) and coastal regions have worsened, but have not been addressed promptly or adequately. This had led to increasing incidences of disorder associated with water pollution as well as mosquito borne diseases, such as dengue.
Does the history is repeating
Chronic kidney disease of multifactorial origin (CKDmfo) also known as CKD of uncertain aetiology (CKDu) has been present in Sri Lanka since mid-1990s. This incidence is doubling every 4 to 5 years. Once pass the CKD stage IIIB, it is virtually impossible to reverse, thus early diagnosis is critical.
Centuries ago, the Chola invaders from south India destroyed the Sri Lankan (then known as Helabima, Hela) ancient irrigation systems. Inhabitants were failed to repair these large structures in a timely manner, thus conditions deteriorated to the extent that they had to flee. Stagnant water led to a pandemic of malaria in the NCP, and most peasants and rulers fled to the central and southern regions of the country for survival. The jungles claimed thousands of the destroyed cascade irrigation tanks and reservoirs, and villages were abandoned.
Historically, it is important to note that, after abandoning Anuradhapura, kings and inhabitants move to Polonnaruwa and then to Kurunegala, Dambadeniya, Yapahuwa, etc. What is imperative is that all these regions were colonised in recent years from people living outside the region, and are now afflicted with the CKDmfo epidemic. Whether this is a sheer co-incidence or history is repeating is not clear yet. In addition to having malaria, we do not have historical information on whether these regions were previously affected with CKDmfo or a similar serious disease, or some other public health disaster; so that peasants and kings could not to return to these regions.
Problems in the region were further aggravated by the neglect of colonial rulers who occupied and controlled Lanka from 1505 to 1948. If the current epidemic of CKDmfo is not controlled in a timely and efficient manner (not happening even today), history may repeat itself, with the NCP again abandoned. It has been estimated that, at the current death rate due to CKDmfo, comparison to the number of males lived in the NCP in 2012, there will be only 10% of that be live in the NCP by the year 2042 (Wimalawansa & Wimalawansa, 2014).
CKDmfo is a chronic emergency
The escalating incidence of CKDmfo is a chronic public health emergency secondary to an environmental crisis, in which the cause(s) is yet to be identified. It also reflects the failures of successive government policies and the lack of concern for the agricultural communities and the poor. Even today, the policymakers and administrators have failed to understand the catastrophe and its socio-economic and health consequences for the country.
The current CKDmfo epidemic, caused by occupational and environmental exposure and geochemical adversaries, provides challenges in diagnosis, management, and prevention. Currently, none of these three areas is managed well in affected communities. However, data from the populations exposed to low levels of environmental adversaries indicate that many years of exposure are required for the genesis of the disease (Madden and Fowler 2000; Wimalawansa 2015; Wimalawansa & Wimalawansa 2014).
Why people live in specific geographical areas only are affected
People who drink water from deep tube wells (where no agrochemicals are present) and ones who have never been involved in agriculture (and thus have little or no exposure to agrochemicals), and those who do not get water from the River Mahaweli (or tube wells), also have contracted CKDmfo.
Among people in adjacent villages who use similar agrochemicals, eating same locally produced food and alcohol, cook in same types of utensils taking similar medications, engaged in same social, recreational and professional activities; folks in one village get the disease, but not in the other! The only difference seems to be the drinking (and cooking) water sources (i.e., mostly from shallow wells). Yet, water testing from these wells failed to identify a unique factor that may cause CKDmfo.
In addition, agricultural areas across the country, farmers use same agrochemicals in similar quantities (or even in higher amounts than those used in the NCP, as in potato farmers in Nuwara Eliya district), where soil, water phosphate salinity and hardness, are similar to or even worse than those of NCP, have low incidences of CKDmfo (Wimalawansa & Wimalawansa 2014). Such areas include Puttalam, Jaffna, Udawalawe, Eastern province, and the Ampara districts.
Common denominators for the disease
Paucity of data on socio-economic backgrounds and changes of social habits over the past four decades of NCP residents and conflicting scientific information, hinder proper understanding of the reasons for predisposition to the disease and what social and cultural dimensions and personal habits and/or aetiologies would contribute to or protect from the genesis of the disease.
The common denominators are that individuals with the disease live in vulnerable areas (relatively flat lands with poor drainage, located in drought-stricken agricultural regions in the dry zones) and consume water from local sources, mostly shallow wells (Madden and Fowler 2000; Sommar et al. 2013).
Nevertheless, none of the factors postulated / hypothesised to-date has been shown to be the cause of CKDmfo in Sri Lanka. However, the combination of some of these nephrotoxins can cause this disease (additive or synergistic toxic effects) even at a lower exposure over a longer period.
(Writer, Dr. Sunil Wimalawansa, MD, PhD, MBA, DSc., is a Professor of Medicine, based in U.S.A., and the Chairman of the Wimalawansa Foundation [https://wimalawansa.org/], who has been working in the CKDmfo field in Sri Lanka, since 1998.)

Clouds clear after May Day rumpus
If one surveys the events that took place this year, especially all Sri Lankan May Day celebrations, one would be able to get a meaningful picture of the political landscape in the country. May Day celebrations here in Sri Lanka are very special.
We had various colourful May Day celebrations in the past including those which were banned or prohibited. However, this May Day, we had the opportunity to witness the entire political picture behind the May Day marches that took place throughout the country.
In Galle, the President led his May Day rally wearing a red jacket. He made two interesting statements. Firstly, he said it is not necessary to debate about federalism, but it is essential to investigate why Tamil leaders make such a demand. It is vital to find the cause of such an agitation. Secondly, he said the populist period of the SLFP is gone, that it is over. It is necessary now to think in terms of social democracy. His May Day rally was organised with groups marching under separate banners and shouting political slogans. Clearly, the pressure of the working masses has made leaders look for left-oriented slogans.
The UNP was better organised as a party with the backing of the urban masses. At a distance, their procession appeared to be a green coloured leftist May Day march! Speaking at the UNPs May Day rally in Campbell Park, Colombo, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said: We will take this country forward, without family rule. He added: We wont privatize State institutions, but we will make sure they will not be a burden to the public.
The Premier also said that government will not increase taxes on essential items, while carrying out work to develop the country with the assistance of the international community.
Social capitalism
He also promised a new salary scheme for public servants, which will be introduced by 2020. His stand is that Sri Lanka should follow social capitalism as spelled out by Bismarck which has become popular in Germany in the recent past.
He said all changes were done after discussions with trade union leaders. We must follow the ancient tradition of Lichchawees; we must debate, discuss and try to achieve a consensus. No doubt, the Prime Minister is under pressure from the working masses.
While both Wickremesinghe and Sirisena appealed to the working masses, Mahinda Rajapaksa appealed to the friends of the family. Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa, speaking at the May Day rally organised by the Joint Opposition in Kirulapone, Colombo, said his family members, including his son MP Namal Rajapaksa and brother Gotabhaya Rajapaksa faced imminent arrest. He boasted that he would not shy away from fighting for the rights of the people because of such threats. After today, there will be cases against those who are close to us. I told Namal to be ready. They have implicated Gotabhaya as well. I may also have to go to jail. But our solidarity with the people will never be broken even if I am jailed a thousand times, he said, adding that the government was making false allegations against his family.
He said it was sad to find that the SLFP, formed by leaders S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike and D. A. Rajapaksa after they quit the UNP during its heyday, had been subjugated by the UNP at the moment.
Mahinda wants to be the hero of Sinhala chauvinist forces and he is expecting the victory of Donald Trump in the US who may reject the resolution on war crimes and failure to protect human rights in Sri Lanka.
While clashes among major parties cleared the dark clouds that used to hide their differences, Left and Trade Unions for Justice organised a successful Left May Day rally at Nugegoda.
As I said in a previous column, this happened after many years. LSSP, CPSL, NSSP and the Trade Unions for Justice contributed to the rally at Nugegoda.
Left and TU May Day
The procession started at Narahenpita junction and moved to Nugegoda via Nawala. Except for a few leaders such as Tissa and DEW, almost all others in these parties joined the Left and TU May Day.
It could be a beginning to build a Left front based on the revolutionary traditions set by old generation Marxists in 1935. A large number of trade unions joined the event with the participation of TUs for Justice with their leader Saman Rathnapriya. Their slogans were to push the leaders of the democratic revolution in the correct direction. However, the fascistic Mahinda movement did not accept the defeat.
They have demanded army security for their leader Mahinda while both PM and President are given only police protection. Probably, these chauvinists want a small army contingent to show around as the leader of the armed power in the country.
Their ambition is very clear: To launch a conspiratorial struggle to take over power to establish a fascistic regime.

KG crackdown as Navy, PNB swoop on smugglers
Within the last six months, 1,490 kgs of Cannabis from Kerala, commonly known as Kerala Ganja, have been seized while 14,799 suspects in relation to smuggling, distributing and possessing Kerala Ganja were arrested by the Police, Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) sources revealed. The authorities are now planning to set up an information exchange centre for the South Asian Region to combat the issue.
The frequency of smuggling Kerala Cannabis from India is evident from recent detections, Police Narcotics Bureau Director SSP Kamal Silva said.
The latest detection was from the North Western Province last week, with five Indian nationals being arrested with 100 kgs of Kerala Cannabis.
They were by the Sri Lanka Navy along the coastal line of Silawatura, Mannar.
Moreover, large quantities of Kerala Cannabis have been continuously seized by Police and Navy during the last six months. Kerala Cannabis weighing around 220 kgs valued at Rs. 40 million was seized by Police in Nawagaththegama, Puttalam in April.
Cannabis is transported to Sri Lanka mostly from South India with fishing boats used to smuggle the Cannabis, Dangerous Drugs Control Board Director General R. Gamage said.
He said there was no difference between the locally grown Cannabis and the Kerala variety.
SSP Silva said the quality of Kerala variety is higher than the local cannabis, increasing the demand for the imported variety.
It is said the price of Kerala Cannabis is over five times more than the local variety.
The smuggling usually takes place in the coastal area from Negambo to Jaffna. The sea route is used more than land route, Naval spokesman Commander Kosala Warnakulasuriya said.
The smugglers mostly enter as fishermen with hundreds of Indian fishing boats. Most packages are then transferred to boats headed to Sri Lanka, he added.
Cannabis and heroin are the major illicit drugs used in Sri Lanka, a report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 2015, United Nations revealed.
Cannabis is illicitly cultivated in the country. The estimated land area under cannabis cultivation was nearly 500 ha in 2014. Cannabis abuse has become a significant problem in Sri Lanka.
According to SSP Silva, there are only two ways to curb the rising smuggling of Kerala Cannabis. One is reducing the demand of Cannabis within the country and the second is to reduce the supply of Cannabis.
The National Drugs Control Board together with police conduct awareness programmes and rehabilitation programmes to reduce the demand of Cannabis, he said.
SSP Silva noted that investigations and detections are carried out by Police and Navy to discontinue the supply of Kerala Cannabis within the country.
Naval patrol craft have been deployed in all suspected areas in the North Western Naval Command, Commander Warnakulasooriya said.
Stating that the Navy maintains continuous surveillance along the coastal belt to prevent drug smuggling via sea, he assured that the Navy conducts intense patrolling along the vulnerable coastline to foil smuggling attempts
Gamage acknowledging that police and other security agencies were making serious efforts to crackdown on the drug smuggling, said Police and Navy apprehend smugglers and the role of Dangerous Drugs Control Board is to monitor them.
Sri Lanka has a clear legislation and the police take legal action against the smugglers, he emphasised.
Gamage added that a proposal to establish an Information Exchanging Centre for the South Asian Region has been referred to the Law and Order and Southern Development Ministry.
With Cabinet approval, further discussions will take place with the United Nations Organisation and the Indian Government to establish the centre, he added.

VAT: The public feel the pinch
As government revenues slide and debt piles up, the decision to increase the Value Added Tax (VAT) from 11 to 15 percent has become a polarising issue in our community. Though the government has exempted water, electricity, essential items, education and healthcare from VAT, the ordinary citizen is finding that an increase in the tax burden a bitter pill to swallow.
KushanPushpakumara, 21:
I work at the railways. The phone bill charges have been affected by this VAT increase. It is always the average citizen who is affected by these taxes. I also eat all three meals out given my work schedule, now that too would cost more.
H.G.N. Priyantha, 39:
I do not think that the VAT increase from just 11 to 15 percent would have a huge impact on our pockets. The government also has excluded some of the essential items from VAT, so it should not be a big problem.
N.C.S Wijesinghe, 41:
This is completely unfair. This is not what the government said it would do when they promised us relief. What relief is this They have money to get down Benz cars for MPs and ministers but no money to run the country.
A.K. Hassan, 48:
Everything in our shop has gone up in prices. All the items we sell are now more expensive because of this VAT increase. A kilo of sugar which we used to sell at Rs. 85 is now Rs. 110 -115. This only affects the poor people. Business has dropped, people do not have money to spend anymore. This is not what we expected when we voted in for a new government. We thought business would improve.
H.A. Gnanathilake, 58:
There are just two parties which govern the country and each of them simply gets the country into greater debt each time they are in government. These VAT increases will not impact the rich but it will certainly impact us. Now they say the phone bills are to go up, we all use phones, how are we to cope
N. Vishnukanthan, 38:
These increases in taxes just make an already desperate people even more desperate. Those who impose these increases have to realize that. How can they say that the government has no money On what have they spent it all on During the war they had an excuse and they could say that the war was taking all the money but what is their excuse now Those in power need to go to the villages and see for themselves how the people live. There are no proper roads, infrastructure, schools, housingthe problems are endless.
Nirosha Bandara, 35:
We live on rent and that is costly but we have no choice but to continue with it. We have to spend on food, other goods, childrens expenses, the list is endless. With all these expenses, we cannot afford to save for a house. On top of that they are now adding tax after tax on the people. We pay all these taxes but we cannot get anything done in this country without a letter from a minister, whether it is to get a house or job. There is no way out.
HemamaliniAbeyratne, 43:
People do not only live on essential items. A household needs more than that and after May 2, all these have gone up in price. These taxes only impact the average person who lives on a minimum wage. It is fine if the government increases taxes if our salaries also increase on par but we dont see that happening.
Then they take all our tax money but we dont really see them using that for our own benefit. It does not come back to the people. Instead of improving our industries, the government just tries to run on our tax money. This applies to every government which has been in power in this country.
P. Somaratne, 50:
With the increase in VAT, the prices of all our imported items have gone. We import most of our items to be sold here in Pettah because the local market just does not produce enough or items with right finish. These days the price of denim has really gone up. Naturally, sales are dropping.
We have no option but to import. We bring a lot of Indian t-shirts into the country, they have these printed photos on them which are very popular here. Why cant we have people here doing that Our t-shirts are not that attractive.
Tourists tell us that Sri Lankan t-shirts are of better quality but it is not as attractive or fashionable enough for the market. We dont want to send our money out but we just have no choice.
IsharaParanawithana, 33:
We dont see any great developments taking place so it is hard to understand where all the money in the government is going to. Yes, they did increase our salaries but then they are also increasing all the taxes like VAT, so there is really no point in getting a higher salary at the end of the day. What are they using our money on
All Ceylon Bakery Owners Association Vice Chairma Jivantha Perera:
There will be a definite increase in bakery goods with the increase in VAT but we will try to minimise the increase so that it does not affect our customers too much.
It is not only VAT which has burdened us but also the recent salary hike of Rs 2,500 for all also has impacted our cost of production. My business alone has a staff of over 100. It is a combination of many factors.
Poultry Producers Forum President Yakooth Naleem:
Chicken prices are being controlled by the government and this VAT increase has impacted both small and big farmers, making it difficult for us to keep producing chicken at a reasonable cost. In the last three years, there has been no increase in chicken prices.
With the latest increase, the government will now earn close to Rs 15 per kilo of VAT on every chicken. The industry has been greatly impacted by this and it is not only us but also the farmers who supply us with raw material who will have to bear the full brunt of it.
We are the only meat industry which pays the government Rs. 6 billion in government revenue every year. This is a serious problem which will affect all those in the food chain.

CR sacks coach who took them from 6th to 3rd slot
CR & FC one of the leading rugby clubs in Sri Lanka has sacked their head coach Imthisham Marikkar two weeks after the club season ended in March.
CR finished third in the recently concluded Dialog Rugby league behind Kandy SC and Havelocks SC, were runner up in the knockout to Kandy SC and ended up third in the Sevens. At the end of such an impressive season
Marikar said that he was called up by the CR & FC hierarchy president Ravi Goonaratne and vice president Sriyan Cooray and told that the club no longer needed his services.
They told me, we want to take CR rugby to the next level, hence we dont want you, we are getting down a foreigner, Marikkar told the Daily News.
I was simply shocked, no review process, no warning, nothing. So I asked them, After all the hard work I have done for the last two years, now you want me to go and someone else to take the cream
The same day I asked them for my contract copy which I had not been given and also for the letter of termination of my services. But none have been forthcoming so far, said Marikkar. Marikkar took over as head coach during the 2014-15 season and CR at the time was ranked sixth.
The two years he handled the side the club showed remarkable progress. Critics who have a favourable opinion of the head coach said that the efforts Marikkar took to guide the side this season were genuine.
The team didnt have luck coming its way and lost some crucial matches due to poor refereeing. However despite these setbacks the team turned itself into a feared unit as the club rugby season progressed largely due to the contributions made by the head coach and his two assistants Shamly Nawaz and M.J.M. Mushtaq.
We did not sack Imthi, he didnt have a contract and it was not renewed, said CR&FC president Ravi Gooneratne. At this present moment I cannot comment who will take over from him.
Member of the General Committee and the Rugby Board of CR & FC Mangala de Silva said, We have not yet appointed a new coach for the upcoming 2016/17 season. A decision on that will be taken on May 12.
However De Silva who is also a qualified trainer admitted that it would be a foreign coach and that he would be assisting him.
It is reliably learnt that former Army Sports Club and St. Peters College rugby head coach 38-year-old Scottish Ben McDougall is being tipped to take over as the head coach of CR and FC. He is expected to be in the country by next month to take over the team and to prepare them for the inter-club Sevens starting in July.

Late tries by Jason, Sandun sees Lanka home
The Asian Rugby Championship (ARC) Division I competition in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia was an exciting one where the Sri Lanka players showed some excellent playing skills and had that little bit of extra speed and energy to stave off stiff resistance from a determined Singaporeans by registering a hard fought 33 (4 tries, 2 conversions, 3 penalties) to 17 (3 tries, 1 conversion) points victory yesterday. Sri Lanka was trailing 17-15 at the breather.
The Sri Lanka forwards and back divisions combined with maximum commitment and played excellent rugby in sunny conditions. The Lankan forwards specially flankers Jason Dissanayaka, Sudarshana Muthuthantri, second row Sharo Fernando and number eight Buwaneka Udangamuwa were outstanding in the loose while in the back division half combination of vice captain Roshan Weerarathna and fly half Chanka Chandimal, centers Danushka Ranjan, Kanchana Ramanayaka and wingers Kavindu Perera, Sadun Herath fought all the way to bring about this victory.
Sri Lanka played to a set pattern and Singapore spent their time in trying to upset their plans which proved futile.
Sri Lanka shot into the lead through a 30 meter penalty put over by full back Reza Mubarak. Soon after off a beautiful three quarter move Ranjan darted down the left flank and dived over brushing aside the Singapore defender near the left corner flag for a superb try, the difficult conversion was missed by Mubarak and Sri Lanka went in to an 8-nil lead. The Tuskers further increased their lead when off a forward move captain cum number eight Sudarshana Muthuthantri crashed through for a try. Mubarak made the conversion to make it 15-nil.
A few minutes later in the 27th minute Singapore counter attacked and off a grubber kick Sri Lanka full back Mubarak made a silly fumble where they collected the loose ball through their winger Jay-Hykel Bin Jailani and scored an unconverted try which reduced the margin to 15-5.
In the 36th minute, off a five meter scrum Singapores burly expatriate number eight Peter William McFeely barged over Sri Lankan prop forward Kishore Jehan to score another unconverted try.
Just before lemons the fighting Singapore outfit was awarded a penalty try and expat Michael Richard Patterson made the conversion to grab the lead 17-15. After the resumption Sri Lanka fought back and obtained a 35 meter penalty kick which was successfully put over by Mubarak to take the lead 18-17. He was right on target with another 40 meter penalty and Sri Lanka increased their lead to 21-17.
A few minutes later Sri Lankas hard working open side flanker Dissanayaka picked up a loose ball and found the gap to touch down for a spectacular try foxing the entire Singapore defence. Mubarak once again was on target with his kick and Sri Lanka increased their lead to 28-17.
Sri Lankas never-say-die attitude proved to be a thorn in the flesh for Singapore when Chandimal opened the gap with a smart move and gave a fabulous off load to dashing Herath, who scampered through to touch down by the left corner flag. This time around Mubarak failed to add the extra two points but it was enough for the Tuskers to seal a hard fought victory.
Later in the day with the inclusion of nine Fijian imports host country Malaysia almost created a sensational shock before going down fighting by 10-15 to Philippines-Volcanoes who are ranked second behind Sri Lanka.
Sri Lankas next fixture is against host Malaysia on May 11 at 4.30 pm SLT. - WAI

Japan crushes Hong Kong 38-3
Under normal circumstances, the second game of this years Asia Rugby Championship - Top 3 just concluded between Japan and Hong Kong would have been a chance for Leigh Jones the present head coach of Hong Kong to show his class against his former team Japan but the Brave Blossoms produced one of the greatest show by winning 38 points (6 tries, 1 conversions) to 3 (1 penalty) in the end at Hong Kong Football Club in Hong Kong.
The Welshman left Hong Kong in 2014 to be part of Eddie Jones coaching team helping the Japanese side to produce one of the greatest shocks in the history of rugby when they beat South Africa at last years Rugby World Cup.
After the tournament Jones returned to Hong Kong to oversee the change to professionalism for his first real test as head coach in yesterdays game against Japan who are fresh off an 85-0 drubbing of South Korea in the tournament opener last week.
But it was a much changed Japan squad that played against them yesterday and not one member of the Rugby World cup Squad has been included in this Asian Rugby Championship- Top 3 tournament. After losing their head coach Eddie Jones to England national team two months back the Japanese interim coach Ryuji Nakatake picked 17 uncapped players last week to take part in this tournament.
It paid rich dividends in the end where they surprised everyone last week by scoring 13 tries in their 85-0 thumping win over the South Koreans who ranked Asias number two behind Japan.
Jones, meanwhile, has probably the most settled squad in the tournament with Nick Hewson leads a side that includes the likes of Jamie Hood, Ben Rimene, Lee Jones, Kam Shing Yiu, Alex McQueen and New Zealand-born Ryan Meacheam who was given a debut on the wing yesterday, but he could not received much balls for him to darted across the field to do his usual magic. So in the end he was kept in a cold storage for the most part of the match.
Jones, Hong Kong side could not get their set pieces to function nor they could not cope up to the fitter Japanese side that played a spectacular fast-paced game completely shattering the opponents pattern of play, especially at the breakdowns the physical contest was very impressive and in the end ran down as many as six tries.
For Japan, tries were scored by prop forward Hiroki Yamamoto (Two) and one apiece by scrum half Keisuke Uchida, Winger Kentaro Kodama, centre Ryoto Nakamura, flanker Shokei Kin. Fly half Ryohei Yamanaka fired across the four conversions.
While Ben Rimene put over the solitary penalty for Hong Kong.
