Bangladesh reach first-ever semi-final

Skipper Mehidy Hasan and Zakir Hasan hit unbeaten half-centuries as Bangladesh recovered from early setbacks to surpass Nepal's 211 for nine with 10 balls to spare in Mirpur.

Commanding win for Colombo Commandos
Shehan Jayasuriya outshone Dinesh Chandimal with a calculated unbeaten knock of 62 off 47 balls to guide Colombo Commandos to a commanding eight-wicket win over Galle Guardians in the Super T20 Provincial final played at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Man of the Final Shaminda Eranga ripped out four Galle batsmen for 27 runs.
Chandimal played a captain's innings of 68 off 53 balls to take his team to a score of 143-7 after being put into bat first.
But Colombo chased down Galle's moderate total to win with 20 balls to spare scoring 147-2.
Despite losing inform Niroshan Dickwella for 11 in the second over Jayasuriya who smacked two sixes and seven fours and Dhananjaya de Silva (41 off 32 balls) shared a partnership of 94 off 65 balls to put the game beyond Galle's reach.
De Silva was run out with the team needing 36 for victory. However captain Milinda Siriwardana who joined Jayasuriya finished the match off in style with two successive fours off Dilhara Lokuhettige to remain 24 not out.
Apart from Chandimal's innings none of the other Galle batsmen could get to terms with fast bowler Shaminda Eranga who continued to impress on his return from a back injury that kept him out of competitive cricket for almost the entire 2015.
Eranga was a model of accuracy finishing with excellent figures of four for 27 and no would have begrudged him being named the Man of the Final.

Jones looks to break Scottish steel on England bow
EDINBURGH, FRIDAY: Eddie Jones will be looking to achieve what only one of England's previous four head coaches managed to accomplish -- an away victory against Scotland -- when he starts his revival mission with his new team in their Six Nations opener at Murrayfield on Saturday.
Scotland might not have beaten England home or away since 2008, but they have only lost at their Edinburgh base to English sides led by Jones' immediate predecessor, Stuart Lancaster, since the reign of Clive Woodward.
Martin Johnson, Brian Ashton and Andy Robinson all notably failed to notch victories against the Scots at Murrayfield as England head coaches.
Lancaster opened his spell in charge, initially as caretaker, with a 13-6 success away to Scotland in 2012, with a starting XV featuring a trio of debutants -- Owen Farrell, Brad Barritt and Phil Dowson -- and with Chris Robshaw as captain on only his second international appearance.
Having picked up the reins in the wake of Lancaster's failure to guide England to the knockout stages of their home World Cup last year, Jones has plumped for experience over youthful promise in his first team selection as England's first overseas head coach, although the uncapped Northampton prop Paul Hill, Harlequins back rower Jack Clifford and Bath centre Ollie Devoto are all in line for debuts off the bench.
That is an acknowledgement of the task facing an England side captained by the abrasive Northampton hooker Dylan Hartley.
Scotland suffered a whitewash in last year's Six Nations but came within a controversial refereeing decision of making the last four in the World Cup, losing their Twickenham quarter-final against Australia 35-34 after Bernard Foley's late penalty kick for the Wallabies.
"Playing at Murrayfield in front of a passionate Scottish crowd will be a real test for this team but one I know we can rise to," said Jones.
"We've had a good preparation and we'll go in there confident about playing well."
Australian Jones secured his job as successor to Lancaster, who also guided England to a 20-0 win at Murrayfield in 2014, on the back of his outstanding World Cup campaign in charge of Japan, who achieved a stunning 34-32 win against South Africa but he has a personal score to settle.
The one pool loss that Jones' inspired team suffered, 34-10 against Scotland in Gloucester, cost them a quarter-final place.
Scotland's head coach, Vern Cotter, is also aiming to maintain the momentum of his squad's impressive World Cup campaign.
The native New Zealander has made only two changes to the starting XV that took Australia to the brink in the quarter-final, Scarlets flanker John Barclay coming in for Blair Cowan on the blindside and Edinburgh's Matt Scott replacing the injured Peter Horne at inside centre.
"England will want to dominate us but I don't see why we shouldn't take them on at their strong points," said Cotter.
"We're expecting them to be extremely motivated and physical, and we're looking forward to that challenge."
Scotland are not short of motivation themselves.
They have only won one of their last 12 matches in the Six Nations and have not scored a try against England at Murrayfield since Simon Danielli claimed a consolation effort in a 35-15 defeat against Woodward's recently-crowned world champions in February 2004.

Supreme Court asks BCCI to implement Lodha Committee report in full
The Supreme Court of India has asked the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to implement the recommendations of the Justice Lodha Committee in full on Thursday (February 4).
The two-judge bench comprising Chief Justice TS Thakur and Justice Ibrahim Kalifullah stated that they found no reason to disagree with the recommendations.
"BCCI should understand that this is not a second innings... it's all over," the Supreme Court judges stated."Decks must be cleared for a complete reform. The best course is to fall in line and BCCI must take a very realistic view of the matter. We find no reason to disagree with the recommendations of the committee."
Among the various recommendations made as stated in the Lodha Committee report, was the fact that the Indian cricket board must come under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, since it is performing a public function. However, the board had earlier declined the recommendations stating that it was a private body that did not use public funds.
The report had also recommended that ministers and government servants cannot occupy a position in the BCCI and a professional should be hired to run the day-to-day affairs of the cricket body.
"If you have any difficulty in implementing it we will have the Lodha Committee implement it for you," the bench stated.
The board, which has been reluctant to consider all the recommendations stating administrative complications as the issue, has said that the legal committee will meet on February 7 to discuss the issue. The court has scheduled the next hearing on March 3.

Sylvesterian coach Roland Perera resigns
The long time cricket coach of St. Sylvester's College, Kandy, Roland Perera has submitted his resignation from the post mid way during the current schools cricket season citing business commitments as the reason for taking this decision.
True Perera is having a chain of shops in the city of Kandy but this is not something new to him and he had managed both cricket coaching and business well. He is did coaching at his alma mater for the love of it and often dipping deep into his pockets to keep the cricketers happy.
Sylvester's was when they became all island schools Division one Coca Cola League champions in 1994 and at that time they were the second schools to do so after St. Anthony's College in 1991 when they had a star studded side with three of them going on to play for Sri Lanka together against South Africa.
But St. Sylvester's College did not have stars in their side in 1994 and they lacked the basic amenities and did not even have a playground to practice and they had to depend on the matting wicket of Police grounds, Kandy.
It was the knack that Perera had to get the best out of the team which enabled them to tick. Though not meeting each other in a format at that time the Sylvesterians had to compete in the tournament with schools like Royal College, S. Thomas' College, St. Peter's College, St. Sebastian's College, Ananda College, Nalanda College, St. Anthony's College vie for the same honours arranging their own fixtures.
It was after the Sylvestrians that Trinity College from Kandy won the schools Division one league title. No other school from Kandy except for St. Anthony's College, St. Sylvester's College and Trinity College had won this title.
Perera is a full Sylvester's and played for the school as an attractive left hand batsman, left arm spinner and excelled in fielding in the covers where he never allowed anything to go past him. He also represented the Central Province School in the inter zonal cricket tournament organised by Observer. That was in the seventies.
On leaving school he joined Morrison Sons and Jones Limited and plated in the Mercantile cricket tournament and also for Moors Sports Club in P. Sara trophy cricket tournament which was then the highest level of club cricket before taking wings to the Middle East for greener pastures. He continued his cricket in the Gulf before returning to Sri Lanka in the early eighties.
By then his illustrious elder brother Malcolm Perera after a ten year sting had left St. Sylvester's College to take up employment in the University.
That was in 1982 and Sylvesterians experienced with two cricket coaches for two years before handing over the post to Roland Perera in 1984.
Roland Perera did a marvellous job and continued from where Malcolm Perera had left and who was to letter become the Director Coaching at Sri Lanka Cricket and later the Junior National Coach at Bangladesh for six years.
