New sustainable, inclusive business opportunities in Sri Lanka
CSR Netherlands and CSR Sri Lanka have tied up cooperation with each other to match Sri Lankan industries to Dutch counterparts to develop sustainable value chains.
As the first step in this strategic initiative, experts from CSR Netherlands conducted a Sustainable and Inclusive Business (SIB) scan in Sri Lanka in the Agriculture, Tourism and Apparel sectors. The SIB Scan consisted of a series of sector round-tables with business leaders on sustainability challenges &solutions and co-creating an agenda for international collaboration. The round-tables were held from February 19 to 23 at the Galle Face Hotel Colombo.
CSR Netherlands and CSR Sri Lanka shared with Sri Lankan business leaders and SMEs the international best practices and innovative solutions to various sectoral challenges in the field of sustainability and inclusiveness. Focus of the discussions was on soliciting inputs from the private sector and other experts on avoiding negative and creating positive impact on the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals.
The SIB scan will result in an analysis of sustainable and inclusive business opportunities for Dutch and Sri Lankan companies in Sri Lanka in the selected sectors. After the scan, CSR Netherlands and CSR Sri Lanka will facilitate matchmaking between the Dutch and Sri Lankan companies, to bring sustainability best practices into action, like: Post Harvest Losses and prevention of food waste in Sri Lanka, Safe, healthy and organic food without pesticides, Turning cutting waste from the garment industry into new textiles, Zero-waste hotels and zones in tourism.
CSR Netherlands and CSR Sri Lanka will play a key role in further developing programs and approaching potential investors for these sustainable business opportunities in Sri Lanka.
A key focus in the collaboration between CSR Sri Lanka and CSR Netherlands is transforming Startups, Social Enterprises and SMEs into sustainable businesses that can tie-up with businesses in The Netherlands and Europe and compete in the international market place.
The initiative is supported by the Dutch Embassy in Sri Lanka and the Netherlands Enterprise Agency.
Gerard Teuling (Food & Agriculture) and Michiel van Yperen (Textiles & Garments) conducted the round-tables. Both have a proven track record in supporting sustainable businesses in Asia. April 10, a round-table will be organized in The Netherlands with companies interested in matching with Sri Lankan counterparts, who are member of CSR Sri Lanka.

Amazon sinks as US tech stocks continue to slide
Technology shares, which helped power the rise of the US stock market last year, are pulling it lower now.
The tech-rich Nasdaq index dropped 0.85% or almost 60 points to 6,949.2 on Wednesday, driven by declines in firms such as Amazon, Tesla and Broadcom.
It continued a multi-week sell-off spurred by calls for tighter regulation of tech firms, competition concerns and questions over autonomous driving.
The S&P 500 lost 0.3% to 2,605 while the Dow was flat at 23,848.4. Shares see-sawed throughout the day, extending a streak of sharp swings in prices that have rocked markets in recent weeks.
The information technology sector, which includes firms such as Apple, Microsoft and Intel, has fallen more than 6% this month, mostly in the last two weeks.
Analysts said the decline reflects a confluence of factors, including a desire to lock in gains notched last year when technology stocks surged.
A host of other factors - many of them political - is fuelling uncertainty, including trade tension between the US and China, where many technology companies have ties.
The Trump administration has also shown a willingness to intervene in the private sector, calling for anti-trust scrutiny of AT&T's purchase of Time Warner and moving to block Broadcom's takeover of Qualcomm in the name of national security.
A report that US President Donald Trump wants to use anti-trust law or another government power to limit Amazon's expansion added to the worries on Wednesday.
News portal Axios reported that President Donald Trump is "obsessed" with regulating the e-commerce giant.
Tuna Amobi, senior media analyst at CFRA Research, said he thinks some of the reaction to the Amazon report is "overdone" but reflects wider unease about the current market.
"You kind of put all these pieces together and it gives you a sense of a little bit more trepidation out there in the tech space in general," he said.
Amazon shares closed Wednesday down 4.4%, continuing Tuesday's slide. The firm's stock is still up more than 60% from a year ago.
Chipmaker Broadcom sank more than 3%, extending declines from recent weeks. Tesla shares fell another 7%, a day after US safety regulators said they were investigating a recent crash. A decision by ratings agency Moody's to downgrade its credit rating also had an impact. The electric car maker's shares have lost close to 27% in March.
Conversely Facebook shares ended Wednesday on a positive note, eking out a 0.5% gain. The social media firm's stock has fallen by almost 20% in recent weeks, following allegations that leaked user data was exploited for political purposes.
In another reversal of fortunes, shares of traditional retailers - which were hammered by doubts last year - were among the winners. Macy's gained 4.3%, while Walmart rose 2%. BBC News

Attack on UNP supporter ends with fisticuffs at hospital
A tense situation erupted between a group of outsiders and the Dambulla hospital staff over the attack of a UNP supporter in the Dambulla town.
The two parties came to fisticuffs as an argument erupted over the admission of the victim who had been attacked with a Kris knife.
The UNP supporter had been decorating the Dambulla town on Wednesday night (28) to celebrate the swearing in of UNP members to the Dambulla Municipal Council held yesterday (29). It was then that he had been attacked by an SLPP supporter. The man who had suffered serious injuries had been transferred to the Kandy General Hospital for further treatment from Dambulla.
The victim has been identified as Rohana Abeysinghe, the husband of Sumudu Serin Abeysinghe, who was elected as a member of the Dambulla Municipal Council from the UNP. She was to take oaths yesterday.The attack had taken place at around 10 pm on Wednesday night and the victim, his son and a few others had been rushed to the hospital.Staff at the hospital speaking to the Daily News said two persons had beaten two minor staffers before a doctor.
They had beaten the staff alleging that they had not registered the patients name when he was admitted to the hospital. The two minor staffers were admitted to the Dambulla hospital for treatment.The staff explained that when a patient is in a serious condition, they usually take him straight to the doctor and ward without registering them first and it was during this time that the victims friends had attacked them.
The fight resulted in other minor staff engaging in a strike yesterday morning and they stated that they would continue with the strike until the two persons who attacked the minor staff are arrested.
Patients who came to the hospital for treatment started to shout at the strikers and asked that they sort out matters among themselves without inconveniencing the patients. They also asked that the minor staff find fault at their own security department instead of launching strikes.
Dambulla Police, Police Inspector Sampath Wickramaratne who arrived at the scene informed the staff that they had already arrested the son of the victim and another person over the alleged attack, in addition to the person who attacked the victim with the Kris knife, along with the weapon.
The minor staff, however, asked the police to bring the arrested persons before them and produce them before the Judicial Medical Officer. However, the Inspector assured them that he would act in accordance with the law and that he had no right to present arrested persons before other people.
Eyewitnesses to the attack on the Abeysinghe informed the Daily News that they saw the victim and five others hanging flags at the Dambulla Economic Centre when the brother of an SLPP candidate who won the election came up to him. They had both had a friendly conversation and when Abeysinghe turned around to cross the road, the attacker had followed him and struck him with his knife from the back. Sumudu Abeysinghe said the attack had occurred when her husband and friends had gone to decorate the city in preparation for her swearing in the next day.Sources within the Dambulla Police stated that the attack had occurred as a result of an argument that ensued between Abeysinghe and the incumbent SLPP member of the Dambulla Municipal Council, Priyantha Kumara. The Police have arrested Kumaras brother as the main suspect in this case.The hospital staff recounting the incident.

Australia coach Lehmann to quit after South Africa series
JOHANNESBURG, Thursday: A tearful Darren Lehmann said on Thursday he would quit as coach of the scandal-tainted Australia cricket team after the fourth and final Test of a series in South Africa.
This will be my last Test as head coach of the Australian cricket team, Lehmann told a press conference on the eve of the match.
Saying goodbye to the players was the toughest thing I have ever had to do.
After seeing events in the media today with Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft, the feeling is that Australian cricket needs to move forward and this is the right thing to do.
I really felt for Steve and as you see Im crying in front of the media. All the players are really hurting.
Lehmann, who was due to leave the job after the 2019 Ashes series in England, is quitting despite being cleared of any role in the ball-tampering scandal that has rocked the sport. His decision follows 12-month bans given to captain Smith and vice-captain David Warner for the roles they played in a plot to cheat in Cape Town last Saturday during the third Test. Opening batsman Bancroft was banned for nine months for his part in the affair.
My family and I have copped a lot of abuse over the last week and its taken its toll, added Lehmann.
After speaking to my family at length over the last few days, its the right time to step away.
I am ultimately responsible for the culture of the team and Ive been thinking about my position for a while.
Despite telling media yesterday that Im not resigning, after viewing Steve and Camerons hurting, it is only fair that I make this decision.
This will let Cricket Australia make a full review of the team and implement changes to regain the trust of the Australian public. - AFP

In the 2014/2015 financial year the value of imported iron and steel rose 16.7 per cent to Sh88 billion due to projects such as the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport, Lake Turkana Wind Power Project and the expansion of Nairobis Outer Ring Road, as well as the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), according to the 2016 Economic Survey by the Kenya National Bureau of Standards. (KNBS).
But steel imports for construction have required adaptability, in a situation of volatility in volumes shipped in.
In 2016, for instance, KNBS reported that imports of steel and iron dropped by 5.7 per cent to 1,442,600 tonnes on the near-completion of phase one of the SGR, which had been a major import driver in preceding years. However, other construction projects have since led to renewed demand for steel.
These projects include phase two construction of the SGR from Nairobi to Naivasha, the South Sudan to Kenya tighway road link, and the construction of the Upper HillMbagathi link road.
There are also major construction projects set to begin this year and span the next five years.
There are also major construction projects set to begin this year and span the next five years. These include the Sh75.8 billion Kenya-Tanzania highway, the Sh62 billion Lamu-Garissa-Isiolo road, the Sh3 billion Ngong Road dualling, the Sh35 billion phase two expansion of the Mombasa port and the Sh302.6 billion construction of the Nairobi-Mombasa expressway.
The key projects are set to maintain the expansion in steel imports being experienced by freight companies such as Multiple Solutions Limited.
We have been experiencing an influx of steel imports from China since 2013, the onset of the construction of the SGR. But despite the phase one completion last year we are still importing 20,000 tonnes of steel, which is double what we used to import before, said John Orwa, Service Delivery Manager at Multiple Solutions Limited.
In order to accommodate the increase, Multiple Solutions Limited has been forced to hire bigger ships. For 20,000 tonnes of steel, the company is using a 180m length ship, which costs $80,000 to hire, spending 33 per cent more than for the 120m length ship used initially, which cost $60,000.
Its agents from China send the manifest on how much tonnage they are expecting, which the freight company then sends to the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) and the Kenya Revenue Authority. The increase in steel imports means the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) has had to ensure enough manpower to facilitate the timely offloading of cargo to prevent port congestion.
A ship takes at least three days to unload, but basically when you have less cargo, then the manpower is also minimal. However, when the cargo size surges, there is need to increase the labour in order to ensure that cargo is unloaded on a timely basis. KPA ensures that the required manpower is available once the ship arrives, said Orwa.
All the ships whose destination is the Mombasa port must inform the KPA 14 days in advance of the ships arrival in order to facilitate the handling of the cargo.
The allocation of manpower resources then works on a first-come-first-serve basis, with the KPA preparing for a ships docking on the notified day. The space is allocated to another ship if the first-booked vessel does not arrive on that day.
As carriers deploy larger ships in order to meet the demand of certain products, the volume of the cargo can run the risk of overwhelming port authorities, challenging their ability to unload containers on a timely basis, research has found.

CID makes several high profile arrests
The CID on Wednesday made several arrests with regard to two high profile cases, the Welikada prison incident in 2012 and the Avant Garde floating armoury case.
The Commissioner, Welfare of the Prisons Department Emil Ranjan Lamahewa and Police Narcotics Bureau IP Neomal Rangajeewa who were arrested on Wednesday night (28) by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) was ordered to be remanded until April 10 by the Colombo Fort Additional Magistrate yesterday.
The suspects were transferred to the Colombo Remand Prison last afternoon.
They are expected to be admitted to the Prison Hospital due to medical concerns.
Having been arrested by the CID on Wednesday night, the two suspects were admitted to the Colombo National Hospital ward 14, having complained of chest pains.
The Colombo Additional Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake issued the directive for them to be remanded after inspecting the suspects in hospital yesterday.
The Attorneys appearing on behalf of the defendants had requested the judge to provide adequate security for their clients due to the eminent threat to their lives.
Rangajeewa had been involved in many drug busts and many who are behind bars have been as a result of the investigations and raids conducted by the PNB of which Rangajeewa had played a significant role.
The Magistrate accepted the request and ordered the Prison Superintendent to provide extra security to the two accused.
The Colombo Additional magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had also ordered the Prisons Superintendent to call for a report from the Judicial Medical Officer with regard to the health of the two suspects.
Commissioner Emil Ranjan Lamahewa was arrested on Wednesday night at his official residence in Baseline Road,in Dematagoda and Rangajeewa had been asked to report to the CID to record a statement and he was later arrested.
The two suspects were arrested in connection with the Prison incident in 2012 that led to the killing of 27 prison inmates. According to police sources, Rangajeewa had been present at the prison at the time of the riot and he also faces allegations of having a hand in the preparation of the list of persons who were singled out and killed.
Emil Ranjan was the SP of the Magazine Prison at the time of the incident in 2012.
Rangajeewa is said to be having medical complications due to injuries sustained during a drug related raid recently in Piliyandala and had also sustained serious injuries due to a shooting by the disciples of underworld gang leader Makandure Madhush.
Meanwhile, the CID also arrested a retired army Colonel on Wednesday night in connection with the Avant Garde floating armoury investigations being conducted by the CID.
The arrested suspect was a former Colonel of the army who was in charge of the floating armoury at the time. He is identified as Retired Colonel Don Thomas Alfred Wijetunge Tillakaratne a resident of Liyanagemulla, Seeduwa.
He was arrested by the CID at his home in Seeduwa on Wednesday evening. Wijetunge was produced before the Galle Magistrates Court yesterday and ordered to be remanded until April 9
It was reported that the Government Analysts Report with regard to the weapons that were in the floating armoury has still not been received.

Sunday Leader editor Lasantha Wickrematunges murder case:
CID suspicious of Hettiges visit, want more security for suspects
The CID investigating into the murder of senior journalist and Sunday Leader editor Lasantha Wickrematunge's murder said the CID is suspicious of former presidents parliament affairs secretary Kumarasiri Hettige's visit to former DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara (third suspect) in the guise of visiting former MP Duminda Silva.
The CID officers made this submission before Mount Lavinia Chief Magistrate Mohomed Mihal when the Lasantha Wickrematunge murder case was taken up for hearing.
CID officials submitted that statements of 18 members of the 112 Brigade have been reordered so far.
Earlier, a person named Jesudhasan was arrested and imprisoned for Lasanthas murder and two motorcyclists had been mysteriously murdered and there were issues regarding the security of those suspects, the CID added. The CID said that they had informed the Prison authorities to take the security of the suspects, former DIG Nanayakkara and CI Sugathapala seriously, since the CID is worried of what is happening now.
The CID told court that according to investigations, the DIG had instructed Sugathapala to remove the pages of the GCIB where he had altered the notes.When Sugathapala showed his disapproval, DIG Nanayakkara had warned Sugathapala and revealed that he was following a directive. CID also said according to the findings DIG Nanayakkara told Sugathapala that the IGP had wanted to destroy the evidence leading to Wickrematunges murder and Nanayakkara had further asked Sugathapala whether he would like to be killed without implementing those orders.
This information had also come to light during the interrogation of SI Sugathapala. Lasantha Wickrematunge was killed by two assailants who had followed him on a motorcycle at Attidiya on January 8, 2009.
But investigations remained stagnant with no promising progress for around nine years.
However, the present government recommenced investigations under the CID and evidence pertaining to this crime has been surfacing gradually.
The Mount Lavinia Chief Magistrate allowed the request of Attorney-at-law Milindu Sarathchandra to lift the travel ban on retired SSP Hemantha Adhikari (suspect). The Mount Lavinia Chief Magistrate ordered to remand former DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara and SI Tissa Sugathapala (second suspect) until April 9.

Coconut industry will stabilise by June - Navin
Sri Lanka has a population of only 20 million people. There is no use of a government if it cannot feed this 20 million, stated Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake yesterday.
The minister made these remarks at an empowerment programme organized for workers in the coconut industry, at the Coconut Cultivation Board. Coconut production has decreased due to weather fluctuations and so prices have increased. Now the citizens are blaming the ministry and the Cultivation Board. Although I cannot change the weather, I have appointed various societies to provide coconuts under the controlled price. Experts now say production of coconuts would be stabilised by June and we can obtain a harvest of 3,000 million coconuts, said the Minister
The minister donated 33 vehicles for each kapruka society established in the Pradeshiya Sabhas of Kurunegala, Marawila, Gamapaha, Polonnaruwa and Kuliyapitiya. These societies are in the process of distributing coconuts under the controlled price. The minister also distributed grants totalling Rs.10 million and tablets to regional managers. Coconut enjoys high demand in the local and international market. It is our duty to increase the resources and the manpower for this industry. If we can develop cultivation using modern technology and new cultivating methods, we could bring back this industry to its former glory. This duty falls on the Cultivation Board. Although they are doing a good job, Im afraid more is needed, said the minister.
The minister criticised the thinking patterns of the state agencies as well. The state companies should change to meet the demands of the new markets.
We need new leadership with honesty and teamwork.
We should do our best for the future of this industry, irrespective of our parties and our personal agendas.
Referring to the glyphosate issue, the minister said, Its simple. Glyphosate is a weedicide. How can we cultivate without using weedicides

There's no one right way to decorate an Easter egg. Cultures around the world have come up with their own ways to enjoy this ancient tradition, and all of them turn eggs into beautiful and symbolic works of art.
Decorating eggs is a pre-Christian tradition (decorated ostrich eggs have been found in Sumerian and Egyptian tombs), so while this art is closely associated with Easter, you don't have to be Christian or even religious to enjoy it.

Distraught Smith breaks down as he accepts blame for cheat scandal
SYDNEY, Thursday: Distraught former Australian cricket captain Steve Smith accepted full responsibility Thursday for a ball-tampering scandal that has shaken the sport, breaking down in tears while denying it had ever happened before.
Cricket Australia have banned Smith and David Warner from all international and domestic cricket for a year while opening batsman Cameron Bancroft was exiled for nine months over attempted cheating during the third Test in South Africa
Smith, a golden boy compared to Donald Bradman for his batting exploits, was a broken man at an emotional press conference on his arrival back in Sydney from Johannesburg.
I take full responsibility, I made a serious error of judgement and I understand the consequences. It was a failure of leadership, he said, choking back tears as he was comforted by his father Peter.
I know I will regret this for the rest of my life. I am absolutely gutted. Cricket is my life and hope it can be again. Im sorry. Im absolutely devastated.
Smiths fall from grace has been dramatic, and fast.
He was jeered as he made his way through Johannesburg airport on Wednesday surrounded by police and media with concerns over his mental state in the current rabid climate and coach Darren Lehmann calling for all three men to be given a second chance.
Former great Shane Warne, no stranger himself to controversy, offered the trio an olive branch despite days of a harsh and judgemental Australian public baying for blood.
What the public wants to see is change. They want to see you be a better person, he wrote in a column for the Sydney Daily Telegraph. Theyll support you if they see that, and theyll forgive you.
WARNER: STAIN ON THE GAME
Warner, a divisive figure who was charged with developing the plot and instructing Bancroft to carry it out, also broke his silence to say sorry and admit his actions had been a stain on the game.
Mistakes have been made which have damaged cricket, he told his 1.6 million Instagram followers as he made his way back to Sydney.
I apologise for my part and take responsibility for it.
Its a stain on the game we all love and I have loved since I was a boy, he added.
In handing out their tough punishment, cricket chiefs bowed to uproar at home where sportsmen and women are held in high esteem and expected to act in the best interests of the game.
Authorities also needed to act decisively to counter mounting concern from sponsors over reputational damage.
CAs response wasnt enough to save an estimated Aus$20 million (US$15 million) partnership with naming rights sponsor Magellan which tore up its three-year contract Thursday after barely seven months.
The financial cost for the players is also growing with sporting goods company ASICS ending its relationship with Warner and Bancroft. Electronics giant LG axed Warner on Wednesday, while Weet-Bix and Commonwealth Bank dumped Smith.
Other team sponsors, including Qantas, have voiced their deep disappointment over the scandal but so far have taken no action.
BANCROFT: I ASK FORGIVENESS
An emotional Bancroft said he was ashamed of himself when he arrived back in Perth.
All I can do in the short term is ask for forgiveness, he said, while denying he had ever tampered with a ball before, in comments echoed by Smith.
I have made a big mistake for allowing this to happen, said Smith.
This is the first time I have seen this happen and it will never be happening again.
Smith -- the worlds number one Test batsman -- was charged with knowledge of the potential ball-altering plan, while Warner was charged with developing the plot and instructing Bancroft to carry it out.
CA said Bancroft, who has played just eight Tests, had illegally attempted to artificially alter the condition of the ball using sandpaper.
It added that Smith had continued to try to cover up the cheating plot by issuing misleading public comments regarding the nature, extent and participants of the plan.
In a further blow, it ruled Smith and Bancroft would not be considered for team leadership positions until a minimum of 12 months after the end of their suspensions, and Warner will never lead again.
While they are banned from top-level cricket, they can still play at club level in Australia or in other countries.
Lehmann remains in charge because Cricket Australia said he was unaware of what was going on.
Wicketkeeper Tim Paine will take over the Australian captaincy for the fourth and final Test starting in Johannesburg on Friday, with Matt Renshaw, Glenn Maxwell and Joe Burns drafted in as replacements. - AFP

The event was attended by Victoria Coakley, Australias Head of Development Cooperation in Sri Lanka and a delegation from the High Commission.
Market Development Facility  Australias flagship private sector development programme in Sri Lanka has been a key supporter and facilitator of Divrons business expansion over the past few years. Also present at the occasion were Shanthi Srikandarasa, MP, and Kandiah Sivanesan, Northern Provincial Council Minister of Fisheries.
Directors Shan Meemanage and Dr. Tim DeJager have built a successful and sustainable business centred on the rearing and harvesting of a special variety of giant prawn, which can sometimes grow up to over half a kilogram.
Divron has a nursery in Negombo, where it mimics the prawns natural habitat and grows prawn larvae, following which it stocks selected reservoirs in the Northern Province, which has the ideal conditions, with the partially grown prawns.
MDF encountered Divron in 2015. As Dr. DeJager said, the value chain existed in small fragments, but Divron needed support to connect the dots. MDF stepped in to strengthen the links in the value chain  through helping Divron establish a Regional Centre in Vavuniya, which acts as a hub for the transport of both of baby prawns (to the reservoirs) as well as full-grown prawns (from the reservoirs), and by adding to its transport network by cost-sharing on the purchase of the trucks necessary to move the fresh product from point to point. Through the successful business partnership, MDF has supported Divron to expand its cold storage facilities, provide reliable information to the fishers on harvesting and post-harvest best practices, and connect more local fisher communities to the network.
Head of Development Cooperation Victoria Coakley said, Australia is committed to partnering with businesses like Divron that have the potential to take world-class Sri Lankan products and produce to the international market. The giant prawn is becoming a must-have on the list of tourists in Sri Lanka  and we believe products like this are flag-bearers for the authentic Sri Lankan experience visitors to this country are looking for.

Domestic  fox!
It sounds like a tall tail - but this family really do keep a fox as a pet at home.
Mum-of-four Natalie Reynolds, 35, hand-reared her unusual pet Jasper after he was abandoned as a cub.
And now their bright eyed and bushy tailed companion lives happily alongside her young children, three dogs and a cat .
Natalie has defended her decision to keep Jasper as a pet - and told how she even walks it on a lead.
She admits the eight-month-old fox does have a tendency to nip strangers, but her son Chace, three, and daughter Marissa, five, delight in taking Jasper on their trampoline.
Natalie said: They get such bad press but hes around my children and he just plays with them. Hes got a different bond with me. Hes not so great with my partner.
Natalie, who also has three dogs and a cat, added: Hes like a cross between a cat and a dog. Hes part of the pack.
The dogs chase him around, he loves the cat but the cat isnt too fond of him. I always walk him on the lead - hes so domesticated. A lot of people look down their noses at you. Some people are disgusted but most people are good about it. Ive been told they are very versatile and that he could be released back into the wild but their average lifespan in the wild is just 18 months - they either get shot, poisoned, snared or hunted.
Jasper was just two days old when he was abandoned by his mum and handed in at a veterinary surgery.
Natalie, whose friend works at the practice, was given the offer to raise the fox by hand. She said: I was up every two hours in the night with him - it was like breastfeeding my children. The first week or two it was through the night, I would have to get up and feed him until it progressed to getting him downstairs and he was in a crate downstairs like a puppy would be.
Stay at home mum Natalie, who lives in an affluent rural village in Herts., created an enclosure for Jasper in their garage. He runs free in the garden during the day - where he plays with the children - and goes out for family walks but is caged at night for his own safety.
Animal charities have raised concerns over foxes being kept as pets.
Lydia Parry, veterinary nurse at Vale Wildlife Hospital, said foxes have been known to bite children.
She said: Obviously the fact that they are wild animals would probably increase that risk. Its the unpredictability of the animals because they are wild animals and they will always have that instinct. We definitely dont recommend having foxes as a pet at all. They dont make suitable pets, they are very smelly, they are difficult to look after and from the animals point of view we dont think it is ethical at all to keep a wild animal in captivity.
The RSPCA say there is no legal restriction on keeping foxes as pets in England and Wales. But a spokeswoman added: ...because foxes are wild animals and do not fare well as domestic pets, they should not be kept as such.
Even the most experienced fox experts have had difficulty keeping adult foxes successfully in captivity as they have very specific needs. The RSPCA would not advise or condone keeping them as pets.
In 2013, a fox ripped a baby boys finger off after getting into a family home in Bromley, Kent.
Denny Dolan, who was just five-weeks-old at the time, had to have his finger reattached in surgery and needed stitches to his cheek, as well as treatment for injuries to his face and head.

Dubai's  24x7 bookstore
If you are a bookworm and happen to be in Dubai, then you must not miss a chance to visit the citys first-ever 24x7 trust bookshop and that too with no support staff.
The bookshop, named Book Hero, is running a mini pop-up stand at Marina Walk in Dubai Marina through May. The store does not have any staff and it runs on public trust.
Book Hero has over 20,000 novels in stock and relies on a payment drop box called the Trust Box, making it the regions first unstaffed bookshop. All the customers have to do is to just drop their money in the box and be on the way!
Montserrat Martin, the owner of Book Hero, partnered up with Emirati entrepreneur Mohammed Abdulla Alqubaisi to come up with the idea, believing in customer trust.
We dont employ staff simply because we trust our customers. I visit the place once a day to replace stock and collect money, Martin told Gulf News.
Commenting on whether someone would steal a book and walk away, Martin added, Nobody would steal a book and even if someone does it would cost me just 300 dirhams which is nothing compared to what I would spend on hiring staff and paying for overheads like visa and insurance.
Book-lovers will find it very easy to navigate through prices as well. The books will be tagged with green and yellow stickers to indicate their prices, ranging from 10 dirhams to 20 dirhams, respectively.
Most of the books on offer are in English and Arabic. However, there is a good amount of French, Russian, Spanish and Chinese books as well, making the store a truly one-world destination for bookworms.

Environment Ministry  to begin testing GMOs
The Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry will be setting up a bio-safety screening procedure to test the safety of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) coming into the country.
In the future, we will make evidence-based and need-based decisions on GMOs, said Bio-safety National Project Manager Shanaka Gunawardena.
He was speaking at the ceremonial project launch at the Waters Edge in Battaramulla on Thursday.
Sri Lanka signed an international GMO screening protocol in 2000 and ratified it in 2004. Since then, Parliament also drafted a Bio-safety Act in 2014, but it is yet to be enacted. According to the Secretary to the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry Anura Dissanayake, the country still does not have a sufficient capacity or a functional administrative and operational system to establish bio-safety.
Its important to test the safety of GMOs now, he said, as climate change, changing rain patterns, and periods of drought affect traditional crop yields. The new bio-safety project is supported with funding from the Global Environment Facility and technical support from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, according to a Ministry press release. GMOs, or Genetically Modified Organisms, are animals or plants whose genes have been modified for different properties. Over 90 percent of Indias cotton crop, for example, is GM cotton modified to be pest-resistant.
This is a fantastic technology, said Professor Athula Perera, the Coordinator of the National Bio-safety Framework Project. It can transfer characteristics across species, across kingdoms.
But critics warn that GM crops can introduce unforeseen consequences into the environment and the people who consume them.
Of course there is a risk, Professor Perera acknowledged. But we need to get together and use this technology  while ensuring a safe and healthy nation.

Final decision on LP gas, milk powder prices soon
The Government has not yet taken a final decision on revising the prices of LP gas and milk powder, Industry and Commerce Ministry Director Indika Ranathunga said.
Speaking at a media briefing at the Finance Ministry auditorium yesterday, the Director said requests have been received from Litro and Laugh gas companies to raise the price of domestic 12.5kg gas cylinder by Rs 275.
The increase in gas prices in the world market and the increase in exchange rates for US Dollar to Sri Lanka Rupee have been cited as main reasons for the demand. The companies have asked to consider the loss they had to incur as the prices were not revised last year, she said.
She said the companies importing and distributing milk powder have requested to increase the price of 1kg of milk powder by Rs 100. However, she said the discussions in this regard were inclined towards not increasing the milk powder prices.
Currently, the Consumer Affairs Authority and the Finance Ministry are discussing on price revisions of gas and milk powder and a final decision will be made by next week. Most likely, the prices will not change before the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, she added.
Lanka Sathosa Limited Chief Executive Officer Dr S H M Faraaz said essential items would be sold at comparatively low prices at island wide Sathosa outlets during the Avurudu season. He said mobile units will be deployed in selected places such as stations during the festive season to sell essential items to people who return to their villages.
He said the prices of local potatoes, big onions, dhal and rice would be further reduced by next week.
Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute Sales Division Head W H Duminda Priyadarshana assured that there would not be any rice shortage in the country this year.
Paddy was cultivated in about 639,000 hectares in the Maha Season and we expect 2.4 million metric tonnes of paddy. This is sufficient for eight months local consumption, he noted.
Consumer Affairs Authority Pricing and Management Assistant Director W R Meewanage said raids would continue throughout the festive season, adding that it has conducted 1,700 raids up to March 24.
Census and Statistics Department Agriculture and Environment Statistics Director A M U K Alahakoon said the inflation decreased to 3.2 percent in February from 5.4 percent in January, on a year-on-year basis. He said this was the lowest inflation recorded since April 2016.

Finding the disappeared in Sri Lanka
In February, one-and-a-half years after Parliament passed the legislation to do so, President Maithripala Sirisena appointed commissioners to the Office of Missing Persons (OMP). The OMP was the first pillar of the unity governments reconciliation agenda.
Official estimates put the number of disappeared people in Sri Lanka at around 20,000. Many went missing during the final stages of the war in 2009 and in the subsequent IDP camps, while families in the South also have memories of white vans and kidnappings during the two JVP insurrections. The OMPs eight commissioners are tasked with tracking down information for the surviving families on what happened to their lost loved ones.
Attorney Saliya Pieris, PC, is the Chairperson of the OMP. Hes a former member of the countrys Human Rights Commission and a respected fundamental rights lawyer. He sat down with the Daily News this week to discuss setting up the new body, and its plans for the future.
Q: The Office of Missing Persons first met early this month, and last week the commissioners had their first public meeting with relatives of the disappeared. Can you tell me about that meeting
A: Yes, actually we were invited to that meeting by an organization called the Families of the Disappeared, which is part of the Right to Life movement. They invited me, as the OMP Chairman, and the commissioners for a meeting with the family members of the disappeared. So there were people from different parts of the country whose relatives disappeared during different conflicts, like the 19871989 conflict as well as the North-Eastern conflict. There were also some families of members of the armed forces, those who are Missing in Action.
They wanted to share their experiences and their views, and they invited us for that. But over the next few weeks and months, we will reach out to the different families of the disappeared, in the North and East as well as in the South. We will do that after we have done some planning, so we can share with them what we hope to do.
Q: Right now is there any formal structure for families who wish to submit a complaint
A: There isnt. Because this is an entirely new office. The first step is to establish the physical office, as well as to recruit staff. So for the moment we have appointed a Secretary, M.I.M. Rafeek, who is a former Secretary to the Ministry of National Economy. We will be starting from a temporary office in Nawala, in the first part of April. We are in the process of getting the approvals to recruit certain temporary staff, and we will, in the next month or two, be finalizing our organization structure.
Q: How many staff are you looking to hire
A: We have not yet decided on the numbers, but there are several units which are mandated by the law. There is the tracing unit, the victim and witness protection division, the administration division, and other divisions which we will be looking at to create.
Q: Would the first office, in Nawala, only be serving the Colombo area Is there a plan to have regional offices
A: No, that would be more temporary, just an outfit to get the process going. We plan to have regional offices, but those divisions are not yet finalized. The long-term plan is to have regional offices, of course, in the North and East, but also in other areas as well.
Q: Is there a simple, ideal vision of how the OMP will operate that you are pitching to families now, many of whom have waited so long for a mechanism like this
A: We do not want to impose a structure on the families. We will go to the families, and we will ask them also for their views on what they want. We feel that that the consultation process is important, because the families should have the sense that this belongs to them and is not something that is imposed from the top. I think thats important, because sometimes people feel that the state is imposing things and that this is not really what they want. So we are sensitive to the fact that there are a lot of families, especially in the North and East, who are skeptical of the OMP. We have to acknowledge that. It will be our challenge to create confidence. Having said that, there is not going to be a quick fix. We have to understand that this is going to take a while, because it involves establishing the structures, recruiting the right staff, and then looking at the various instances of the disappeared. And there are thousands. So this is a long-term effort, but in the short term, we are doing whatever we can do alleviate the suffering of the people.
Q: Do you think there is enough independence for the OMP in the Act, so that the institution can live on through successive governments without political influence
A: The Act gives the institution independence, somewhat on the lines of the Human Rights Commission Act. Of course the difference between the OMP and the Human Rights Commission is that the Commission is also given a Constitutional provision. But I think the independence given is sufficient to perform the task.
Of course, having said that, political will is also very important if the work of the OMP is to be successful. The political will of the government is absolutely necessary, because we need the cooperation of other segments of the state to do our work.
Q: In early statements, you have asserted that the OMP is only a fact-finding body, that its not a court of law. But obviously some of the findings regarding enforced disappearances might have criminal implications and should be taken to court. How will you navigate this tension
A: Our function is not to punish. The law specifically says that the findings of the OMP cannot be used in any criminal or civil proceeding. They cannot be used as evidence in a criminal proceeding. However, if in the course of the OMPs investigation, it is revealed that there is something that is a violation of criminal law, the OMP has the discretion, and it is important to emphasize discretion, to refer it to the prosecutorial authority. Then it is up to the investigating or prosecutorial authority to investigate afresh. We, the OMP, do not have punitive powers.
Q: How are you picturing the end result of an OMP investigation Will it be a document of fact handed over to families
A: No, it will not be a document only. We can make proposals about practical aspects like what sort of reparation should be given to the victims and their families. What other measures can be done for their welfare, for instance. We intend to give them psychosocial support as well. Many families dont want just a document, they want something more. They want to know the fate of their loved one, what happened to him or her. Wherever possible, we will inform the families. But beyond that, there is also the making of recommendations for the alleviation of suffering.
The OMP is also empowered to make recommendations for the non-recurrence of disappearances. Disappearances should not happen, and what can we do to ensure this We are also thinking about memorialization of the disappeared.
Q: When do you think the office will officially begin its investigative work
A: In the first week of April we will be in a new office, which is on the first floor of the Ministry of National Reconciliation in Nawala. But afterwards we will shift to our permanent office. We have already started discussions and started planning.
Q: The OMP has always been hounded by two types of criticism. On one side you have the families of the disappeared, especially in the North and East, who say they didnt feel heard in the crafting of legislation, that they werent involved in the process, that they dont like that one of the commissioners is a former member of the military, and so they dont have faith or trust that you can deliver what theyre asking for. On the other side, the criticism is that youre going after the war heroes, youre going to tarnish Sri Lankas reputation, and that there are OMP commissioners who have spoken against the government of Sri Lankas human rights record. So they dont trust it for those reasons. How do you feel sitting in the middle of this Do you feel a need to address either side
A: Of course, this is quite natural. When we assumed office we were under no illusion that this would be the response. We fully understand the scepticism among the families of the disappeared. However, allegations against individual members are unreasonable. Theres no basis for it. The members of the OMP are diverse. We have a member whose husband disappeared. We have another representative from the North, and then we have the retired legal advisor to the military. Its a diverse membership and I think theyre all important elements for the work of the OMP.
When we speak about the disappeared and missing, what I think both sides of the equation forget is that there are the disappeared and missing in the North and East, and there are the disappeared and missing in the rest of the country: the hill country, the Southern areas.
There are enforced disappearances, not only in the aftermath of the North-East conflict, but which are totally independent from that. Then you have the members of the Sri Lankan armed forces who are missing in action, and their families want to know what happened to them.
So the criticism is not unexpected, but we have to carry on, according to our mandate which has been given by Parliament.
Q: So just in your first month youve started hearing from the different people you will be interacting with. Do you think most of the cases youll be taking on will be from the North and East, from the end of the war
A: We will ensure that we will consider the disappeared from all sectors. We expect a substantial portion from the North and East, but also a substantial portion from the rest of the country.
Q: In some cases, like the JVP insurrection of 1971, families have been waiting decades without answers about the loss of their loved ones. Have you met people who are still looking for information about their lost family members from so long ago
A: Yes, I have. Among the people we met of the families of the disappeared, there were people from the North and East, but also those whose children or husbands had disappeared during the 19871989 conflict.
They are still looking for answers.
One person who spoke to me said that in his village, in the central area, there were dozens who had disappeared. One person told me that all his brothers had disappeared. Hes still looking for answers. I spoke to a Muslim woman from Colombo whose son had disappeared, a Tamil lady whose son had disappeared.
There were several older women, probably in their 70s, with photographs of their children. This problem, of the disappeared and missing, its such a human problem. People have to understand this. People want closure. And I think that is the duty of the country, to recognize that these disappearances happened, and there must be closure, and there must be some form of reparation for the families of those who are missing or have disappeared.

Footsteps to Freedom
Everyone deserves to be heard and respected, says Kumar Sangakkara, former Sri Lankan cricket captain as he joins forces to assist fellow Lankans win the battle of life. Improving the emotional well being of all Sri Lankans is vital.
According to sources currently eight to ten people commit suicide per day. For every one person who dies by suicide, there are many failed attempts. We should all together create awareness and prevent suicide in the country, said Sangakkara, Ambassador of CCCline 1333.
CCCline 1333 established by the Courage Compassion Commitment (CCC) Foundation in partnership with Lifeline in Australia and the National Institute of Mental Health in Angoda, Sri Lanka aims to prevent suicide in Sri Lanka through education, engagement and empowerment to break the stigma attached to mental illness and social issues.
Since its inception in December 2009, CCCline 1333 has been steadily moving forward towards its goal of being a credible, accessible and most utilised telephone counselling service in Sri Lanka.
CCCline 1333 is a confidential and free telephone counselling service to encourage people to talk about their problems whether they are personal, relationship or family issues, schools or work worries, mental illness or suicide thoughts. CCClines 1333 short code number is a toll free number accessible to all people of Sri Lanka. The service currently averages over 2,000 calls every month.
CCCline 1333 Telephone Counsellors are trained under the guidance of Lifeline Australia, the largest telephone counselling service in Australia. The Telephone Counsellors provide their services in a voluntary capacity.
At the moment CCCline 1333 operates from 9am to 9pm. We want to expand it and make it open for calls 24x7. All callers are treated with dignity and respect by the Telephone Counsellors, who listen and empower the callers to resolve their problems.
If required, callers are also referred to other related services in their local area for further support, CCC line Manger, Ranil Tillakaratne said. To raise the needed funds CCCline 1333 will commence a walk on April 1. Footsteps to Freedom, a 44-day walk across the country, with a team of volunteers, holding workshops along the route to educate residents on mental health. This walk is a collaboration between two organisations that are doing significant work around emotional well-being and suicide prevention: CCC line 1333, which is a telephone counselling service available toll-free, and Shanthi Maargam which is an organisation that works towards the emotional well-being of the young people of Sri Lanka.
Out of the Shadows, 1333 Bikeathon will also be held in August this year to create national awareness of CCClines 1333 toll free number in Sri Lanka and raise funds to sustain and expand its operations.
Kumar Sangakkara, ambassador of CCCline 1333 may join part of the ride in Sri Lanka depending on availability.
Apart from its CCCline 1333 Telephone Counselling Service, CCC Foundation also established and manage CCChouse, a 194 bed transit home for outpatients with cancer and their carers at the premises of the National Cancer Institute Maharagama Sri Lanka.

The Chairman of Lanka Sportsreizen Thilak Weerasinghe said that the recognition of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is a great achievement and hope that they will go from strength to strength this year.
He said his organisation has been a pioneer in promoting tourism through sports with the Colombo Marathon having attracted several foreign competitors and their family members which has helped to promote Sri Lanka as a tourist destination.
The Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekara said that he hoped that our cyclists will finish within the first ten in this event which will be a great achievement for the country.

Homagama Tech City will be built with minimum damage, acquisitions - Ministry
The Homagama Tech City will be built on 450 acres of bare land and no major individual properties will be taken over as alleged by some, Ministry officials claimed yesterday.
The Tech city in Homagama had been initiated to promote a knowledge based economy as opposed to the traditional economy and to rid the country from the middle income trap. Certain misled and misinformed political organisations are spreading false information to the public and causing unrest among citizens, Ministry Additional Secretary Madhawa Waidyaratne said.
A press conference was held yesterday by the Ministry of Megalopolis and Western Development to clarify the issues of the Homagama Tech City that had created controversy earlier this week.
These misled people and activists state the ministry is destroying houses and establishments to build this tech city. But in reality we have acquired 450 acres of bare land where only one house is built. Other activists point out that this is a project carried out in collaboration with Korea. This is a lie. Our department officials went to Korea to obtain specialist advice in transport, utility and land facets which will help engineers plan and execute the project accurately, the Additional Secretary said.
There is no denying that certain destruction to the environment is caused. But we have carried out a strategic environmental assessment with the Environment Ministry and minimised the destruction caused to nature, he said.
We have to expand the current access roads leading to the city and there is no need to acquire private individual lands for this process. However, lands of 28 families are to be acquired to construct the interior roads and due compensation will be paid to each of those families, he said.
The construction is carried out according to the widely accepted sustainable development criteria. Therefore, the ministry guarantees that the citizens of Mahentanna and Pitipana will not be displaced.
This Tech City opens new avenues of technology. Several universities including the Jayawardhanapura, Moratuwa and Colombo had begun constructing technical faculties. This project would further create new employment, Ministry Secretary Nihal Rupasinghe said.

IMF welcome Myanmar economy rebound, warn of downside risk
The International Monetary Fund has just released the findings of its Article IV consultation with Myanmar in which it welcomes the countrys economic rebound but cautions about the downside risk.
Myanmars economy stabilized in 2016/17 said International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, the IMF says that Myanmar is improving but there are gray areas.
Following is the release of the finding of IMF study done by the Executive Board of the IMF in consultation with Myanmar.
The new government saw a challenging first year with lower-than-expected growth of 5.9 percent in 2016/17 mainly due to weak agriculture production and exports, and temporary suspension of some construction projects in Yangon. The fiscal consolidation to about 2.5 percent of GDP deficit in 2016/17, from the election year deficit of about 4.5 percent of GDP, helped to reduce central bank financing of the deficit and imbalances. Inflation moderated to 6.8 percent, and the current account deficit fell to about 3.9 percent of GDP in 2016/17 from 5.1 percent 2015/16. The current account deficit continues to be mainly financed by FDI, with the real exchange rate and international reserves (at 3.2 months of prospective imports) broadly stable.
The medium-term macroeconomic outlook remains favourable. Growth is expected to rebound to 6.7 percent in 2017/18 mainly supported by a recovering agriculture sector and exports. Higher fiscal spending anticipated in the second half of 2017/18 due to buoyant tax revenues will also support growth. While the direct economic impacts of the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine State have been largely localized, the social costs and full impacts of the crisis are yet unfolding.
Over the medium term, growth is expected to gradually pick up toward the estimated potential rate of about 7.0 percent to 7.5 percent, reflecting continued large FDI inflows and an improvement in public investment spending and efficiency.
Risks are tilted to the downside. The banking sector needs to adjust to important new prudential regulations after a period of rapid credit growth. The humanitarian crisis in Rakhine state could affect development finance and investor sentiment. Additional risks stem from commodity prices, potentially volatile global financial markets, exposure to spillovers from China, and the risk of natural disasters. On the upside, implementation of a more detailed strategic reform plan and higher infrastructure investment would raise potential growth.
Executive Directors welcomed the rebound in Myanmars economy and its favorable long-term growth prospects. However, downside risks have increased, including from the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine State. Expressing their strong concern, Directors highlighted the need for early and tangible progress toward peace and regional inclusion, to improve conditions in affected areas and to realize Myanmars strong potential for inclusive growth.
Directors also called for a second wave of reforms to help sustain Myanmars economic transition and growth take-off. They commended the release of Myanmars Sustainable Development Plan (MSDP) and recommended that the MSDP be expanded to address reform sequencing and regional disparities, including the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine State.
Directors underlined the need for sufficient resources to achieve the SDGs, while ensuring that fiscal policy remains anchored on debt sustainability and a lowering of central bank financing of the deficit. Directors welcomed the sustained progress on domestic revenue mobilization, and saw scope for further expenditure rebalancing and improvement in public financial management. Directors cautioned against excessive use of tax amnesties and incentives, which risk eroding the revenue base. State economic enterprises and large infrastructure projects, including PPPs, should be closely and transparently monitored to minimize fiscal risks and debt distress.
Directors noted the emergence of banking sector risks and supported steps toward improved financial sector regulation. They also supported the implementation of the Banking Sector Action Plan to respond to emerging risks, promote financial deepening, and strengthen the resolution framework. While Directors supported financial sector and interest rate liberalization, they agreed that this should proceed at a pace commensurate with the central banks capacity to regulate and supervise.
Directors encouraged the authorities to formally adopt the new transactions-based exchange rate mechanism. To enhance market certainty, the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) should formally adopt the new transactions-based mechanism for setting the reference exchange rate. Directors also underlined the need to develop the interbank foreign exchange market and allow greater exchange rate flexibility to cushion against external shocks.
Directors considered the current stance of monetary policy as appropriate. They encouraged further development of the monetary framework, including deeper debt and interbank markets. Directors stressed the need to continue phasing out CBM financing of the fiscal deficit, and welcomed the decline in the level of CBM financing in 2016/17.
Directors underscored the central role of capacity development in Myanmars economic transition and growth. They strongly supported the Funds continuing strong efforts in this area and the close alignment with surveillance priorities. Directors commended the steady progress toward improving statistics, and welcomed Myanmars participation in the Enhanced General Data Dissemination System.
Directors noted that Myanmar will soon be in a position to fully meet its obligations under Article VIII. They encouraged continued progress to remove the last remaining exchange restriction and multiple currency practice.

Jesus and Alexander died at thirty-three;
One lived and died for self; one died for you and me.
The Greek died on a throne; the Jew died on a cross;
Ones life a triumphed seemed; the other but a loss.
One led vast armies forth; the other walked alone;
One shed a whole worlds blood; the other gave His own.
One won the world in life, and lost it all in death;
The other lost His life, to win the whole worlds faith.
Jesus and Alexander died at thirty-three;
One died in Babylon; and one on Calvary.
One gained all for self; and one Himself He gave;
One conquered every throne; the other every grave.
The one made himself god; our God made Himself less;
The one lived but to blast; the other but to bless!
When died the Greek, forever fell his throne of swords,
But Jesus died to live forever, Lord of lords.
Jesus and Alexander died at thirty-three;
The Greek made all men slaves; the Jew made all men free.
One built a throne on blood; the other built on love,
The one was born of earth; the other from above;
One won all this earth, to lose all earth and heaven.
The other gave up all, that all to Him be given.
The Greek forever died; the Jew forever lives;
He loses all who gets, and wins all things who gives!

Kiwi companies to explore business opportunities in SL
The New Zealand business delegation representing 13 innovative companies will arrive in Colombo on 2nd April for a 3-day visit to continue forging business and trade links with Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka is an increasingly important partner for New Zealand in South Asia, evidenced by the recent visits from New Zealand businesses and the New Zealand High Commission scheduled to open in Colombo next year.
With one of the highest per capita incomes in South Asia and a growing urban population, Sri Lankas demand for quality manufactured goods and access to healthcare and technology services is rising. New Zealand companies are well positioned to meet this demand due to our strong trade links throughout South Asia and our focus on delivering premium but cost-effective solutions, said Ralph Hays, who leads New Zealand Trade & Enterprises (NZTE) activity in Sri Lanka and South India.
The companies in the delegation are AD Instruments, DGL International Powder Coatings, Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, FRAMEDCAD Holdings, Medtech, New Zealand International Commercial Pilot Academy, Powershield, Redesign, Reese Group, Sealegs, Staah Limited, Tait Communications and Vista / Book My Show.
We see potential to combine the skills and resources of both countries to take value-added goods and services to the world, said Mr Hays.
New Zealand and Sri Lankas two-way trade is NZD367 million (41.3 billion LKR), with tea (NZD21 million), rubber tyres and other rubber products (NZD5.5 million) and food preparations (NZD1.8 million) leading Sri Lankas exports to New Zealand. While New Zealands top exports to Sri Lanka are milk powder (NZD279 million), butter (NZD3.6 million) and fruit (NZD3.1 million).

Lanka Hospitals launches Male Wellness Center
Lanka Hospitals established a Male Wellness Centre for the first time in Sri Lanka in a bid to offer services to improve health and wellbeing of men.
Often men who play the role of breadwinner in a family, tends to neglect their own health by prioritizing the needs of the family. Thus Lanka Hospitals established a fully-fledged dedicated centre to uplift the health and wellbeing of men. The MWC caters to a host of services including Personnel fitness scheduling and programming, sport health and injury management, dietary and nutritional advices, pre-marital counseling and health screening, management of premature ejaculation, management of erectile dysfunction, cosmetic surgeries (Bariatric / Ocular / Dental). In addition to the general health screening, patients can obtain screening for liver, kidney, respiratory, cardiac, diabetic, endocrine-hormonal, cancer and sexually transmitted diseases in addition to substances and alcohol abuses. Furthermore, apart from leading physicians MWC offers the service of competent consultant specialists such as Cardiologist, Endocrinologist, Diabetologist, Venerologist, Urologist, Nephrologist, Oncologist, Surgeon, Vascular Surgeon, Psychiatrist as well as Counsellor.
Lanka Hospitals provides latest medical technology to detect and treat all types of health conditions. Through its precision screening tests, patients gain the advantage of early detection of any illness which requires medical attention.
Erectile Dysfunction (Impotence)is a common health issue suffered by men, defined by the difficulty in maintaining penile erection during sexual intercourse. In the Sri Lankan context, the issue is hardly brought into light especially by those who suffer and often show reluctance to seeking proper medical attention. Often, incorrect and misleading advice not only aggravates the issue, but also lead them to face unwanted complications. A special SWT unit was established within the Male Wellness Centre by the Lanka Hospitals for a cost of Rs. 8 million, to specifically treat impotence. The Centre conducts in-depth studies and comprehensive medical analysis to precisely identify the causes for impotence such as Physiological, Systemic, Vascular and Local  Capillary.

On Good Friday, Christians respectfully commemorate the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who died for the sake of all mankind, stated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his message marking Good Friday and Easter.
The message states: From the early days of Christianity, Good Friday was observed as a day of sorrow, penance, and fasting to remember the suffering and death of Jesus. On Easter Sunday, Christians celebrate the Resurrection, when Jesus rose from his tomb.
Jesus sacrificed himself for the good of humanity and bore his pain in great silence. His life shows that the whole world could be brought together through love, unity and equality.

## Title: LORD JESUS, HOW GREAT THOU ART

LORD JESUS, HOW GREAT THOU ART
St. Stephen's Church, Marawila Good Friday.
Darkness descended in the noon. The curtain in the Temple ripped apart. Graves opened and yielded the dead who were seen walking in the streets. And Jesus Christ breathed his last on the cross.

The day that world's greatest miscarriage in justice was carried out when every Christian can be guilty of nailing him on the cross. He sacrificed his dear life to redeem the world from sin and strife. In his life of thirty-three beautiful years, he lived and preached the Word of God among his sheep. Sheep that were the humble believing Christians from all walks of life who followed him until he reached the Mount of Olives and let him go up to pray.
Jesus knew of his impending death was drawing close and distanced himself from his disciples to pray but asked them to pray for themselves that they may not fall into temptation as the final hours were approaching. As Jesus prayed in anguish an angel appeared and strengthened him. He prayed fervently that his sweat like drops of blood falling, on the ground.
He went back to seek his disciples and found them sleeping, worn out of grief and fatigue. Gently he asked them to get up and pray that they may not fall into temptation. Jesus left them and went away. The hour had come but he still prayed on. He came back to then the third time and asked them why they were still sleeping and resting, The hour had finally come he reminded his disciples for the Son of Man to surrender and as they were speaking to Jesus for the last time, Judas who had betrayed him, arrived and kissed Jesus indicating his identity for arrest by the soldiers. The rest asked their Master whether they could use their swords as one struck the High Priest's slave and cut his ear. Jesus reprimanded him and said enough of this'. He touched the slave's ear and healed him.
Hebrew in 6:6 asks Are we crucifying the Son of God and holding him up to contempt We must search our conscience from Good Friday to Easter Sunday and ponder where we failed, where we could have resisted temptation and where we could have avoided hurting our loved ones or where we could have denied him.
The Holy Bible was my guide from childhood and I was able to read the New Testament backwards like Shakespeare literature. I still remain guided by the Bible and its Holy Scriptures. That is why I ask myself Am I crucifying Him all over again or is it a symbolic recall year after year that we all hypocrite Christians including me repent, gush over and let it pass away for yet another year or are we cheating God' He knows our hearts and from above he is watching us which leaves me still searching for the truth.
We have to go back to the Old Testament when God gave our first parents with the right to disobey Him and in the New Testament to Judas, the right to betray the Lord and between these two events, He stood to test our faith and trust.
DUTIFUL SON
He saw his distraught mother weeping beside the disciple he loved. Even through pain and suffering he spoke to his mother and said that he was her son and Mary his mother and the disciple took her home to live with him. Jesus also comforted all the women of Jerusalem who had followed him and blessed them. Jesus also saw Mary Magdalene whom he loved much crying in desperation. He looked at her for the last time and appeared to her first on the third day. Here the scriptures reveal the abundant love Jesus had for this sinner after forgiving her.
Leaning upon my favourite book in the New Testament which is the Gospel according to Mathew is carefully arranged and begins with the birth of Jesus Christ, describes his baptism and temptations he was subject to, and how he takes to His Ministry of preaching. The Gospel also records his journey from Galille to Jerusalem and all events of Jesus last week; culminating in his crucifixion and resurrection.
This Gospel presents Jesus as the great teacher who has the authority to interpret the Law of God and about the Kingdom of God. As children, we have cherished the Sermon on the Mount his subject matter divided into five collections. They all deal with the present day and the coming of the Kingdom of heaven. Throughout the Gospel, the emphasis is placed on prayer, the Holy Spirit and God's forgiveness of sins, and above all, his sacrifice.
First and foremost, our Christian lives being with the affirmation that God created the universe and promised He would continue to show his concern for us. We have to keep our faith alive no matter what stress and temptation come our way. In the beginning, he liberated his enslaved people and formed them into nations with hope for the future. But what happened later Every nation rose against another and still continues to do so with violence and vengeance.
And look what our church has come to today.
Christian perspective
From the Christian perspective, we can deal with a variety of topics such as riches and poverty, temptation and good conduct as well as wisdom and humility.
When we dwell among all these, we are exposed to challenge, new thinking, and faith in Christian religion which takes me back to where I started searching for the truth. I am still searching but I have not found the truth nor a person who represents the truth which makes me at times think that we all are fakes; fakes in the face of our Lord who sacrificed his life for truth.
This, in fact, is a memorial of Jesus death and his resurrection. Each year, it will call to the memory of the celebrants what our Lord has done to provide an escape for humankind from the condemnation of death. For the Jews who become Christ's followers, the Passover will be the new awakening.
It is easier for the Bible-believing Christians to get closer to the Lord rather than be guided by their spiritual leaders some of whom do not stand for the orthodox doctrine or the morality of the church according to their whims and fallacies.
Our Gospel may have taken roots in Britain in the first century AD, brought across by a Roman soldier who had served in Jerusalem but what matters to most of us whether we are Anglicans or Roman Catholics is that we believe in the same God as found in the Holy Bible.
All of us around the world are enlightened by His sacrifice and Resurrection. The anguish and suffering in mind and body that the Saviour went through to release the world from its sinful bondage, is beautifully captured, once again by Mathew.
His teachings can be beyond our power. I am still to find the truth I have been searching because I am never influenced by individuals but maybe with time as I am guided only by the Bible and its Holy Scriptures.
Lord Jesus how great thou art,
I know you still love me.

Man abducts teenage girl, exploits her at estate house
Sri Lanka has a population of only 20 million people. There is no use of a government if it cannot feed this 20 million, stated Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake yesterday.
The minister made these remarks at an empowerment programme organized for workers in the coconut industry, at the Coconut Cultivation Board. Coconut production has decreased due to weather fluctuations and so prices have increased. Now the citizens are blaming the ministry and the Cultivation Board. Although I cannot change the weather, I have appointed various societies to provide coconuts under the controlled price. Experts now say production of coconuts would be stabilised by June and we can obtain a harvest of 3,000 million coconuts, said the Minister
The minister donated 33 vehicles for each kapruka society established in the Pradeshiya Sabhas of Kurunegala, Marawila, Gamapaha, Polonnaruwa and Kuliyapitiya. These societies are in the process of distributing coconuts under the controlled price. The minister also distributed grants totalling Rs.10 million and tablets to regional managers. Coconut enjoys high demand in the local and international market. It is our duty to increase the resources and the manpower for this industry. If we can develop cultivation using modern technology and new cultivating methods, we could bring back this industry to its former glory. This duty falls on the Cultivation Board. Although they are doing a good job, Im afraid more is needed, said the minister.
The minister criticised the thinking patterns of the state agencies as well. The state companies should change to meet the demands of the new markets.
We need new leadership with honesty and teamwork.
We should do our best for the future of this industry, irrespective of our parties and our personal agendas.
Referring to the glyphosate issue, the minister said, Its simple. Glyphosate is a weedicide. How can we cultivate without using weedicides

Ministry inspects Pattipola Tourist Comfort Centre
The Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Ministry dispatched a special team of officials to look into the status of the Tourist Comfort Centre attached to the Pattipola Railway Station, which is operated by the Department of Railways.
A photograph taken at the facility, where a foreigner was seen lying on a trolley, went viral on social media platforms and subsequently, Tourism Development and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga deployed a team of officials to look into the current status of the facility.
The officials who visited the facility said the Tourist Comfort Centre was not dilapidated as portrayed by certain social media sites and other website reports.
They said the Tourist Comfort Centre is well-maintained and fully utilised by tourists visiting the area.
"There are hardly any complaints about the cleanliness of the place or bad maintenance. The Department of Railways is continuously working on its improvement and and the staff is working around the clock to ensure the proper maintenance," an official who visited the Pattipola facility said.
"During our discussions, the Pattipola Station Master said that the picture, which was shared on social media, had been taken when a tourist fell asleep on a trolley, while waiting for a train. He said some tourists preferred to sit outside and enjoy the beauty of the Pattipola railway station. When analysing the picture out of context, it may give a wrong idea about the comfort centre. But we can assure that the Tourist Comfort Centre is in good condition and it continues to be a useful facility to all tourists visiting the railway station," the Sri Lanka Tourism official added.
The Transport Ministry, the Tourism Development Ministry and provincial tourism authorities are currently working hand-in-hand to improve facilities and infrastructure for tourists travelling across the country.

Ministry to make Strategic Environmental Assessment
The Irrigation and Water Resource Management Ministry had been entrusted to make a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) related to around 80 projects that involve water diversion and reservoir development pertaining to irrigation and drinking water supply facilities.
An Irrigation and Water Resources Management Ministry spokesmen told the Daily News that Sri Lanka is aiming to carry out the final phase of water resources development in order to complete the planned water development projects in the Northern, North Central, Eastern and South Eastern dry zone areas. The final phase involves nearly 75 projects that include water diversion and reservoir development within the aforementioned irrigation sectors, in addition to the projects planned by the Mahaweli Development Authority, National Water Supply and Drainage Board and Ceylon Electricity Board.
The projects would result in a number of negative environmental impacts such as loss of natural habitats and threatened/endemic species,disruption of migratory patterns of wild animals, escalation of human-wildlife conflicts and displacement of people.
Even though these prefects are required to carry out detailed environmental assessments, they, at project levels, fail to take into account the cumulative impact of these projects on the Sri Lankan environment, especially the forest coverage within the country, since an estimated 20,000  25,000 hectares of forest lands would be submerged due to proposed water resource development projects during the next two decades.
At the same time, the drinking and industrial water requirements of the country are also on the rise, stressing the need for a countrywide water resource development plan, the spokesmen said further. Furthermore, human-wildlife conflicts within major agriculture development areas are also escalating at alarming rates, threatening life and property of farming communities.
Therefore, under the circumstances, the proposed SEA is planned to be carried out before the finalisation of future water resource development projects.
It would provide an opportunity to address the potentially negative social-environmental concerns in an effective manner as well as help prioritise the maximum benefits of the projects to the country. Under the programme, in relation to around 19 projects involving water diversion and reservoir development within the Anuradhapura, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Polonnaruwa, Vauniya, Mannar, Mullativu and Jaffna districts, discussions were held recently at Anuradhapura, under the patronage of district secretaries.
Some of the projects taken up for discussions are the Yan Oya Reservoir, Palagala  Kotte Ela, Ragangana LB High-level Sluice, Mahagalkadawala Reservoir, Kudawilachchiya Tank reinstatement, Nuwara  Angamedilla, Upper Elahera canal, Pankulan reservoir, Kinniya and Kantalem Kivul Oyas, River for Jaffna, Per Aru Reservoir, Upper Parangiya Aru Reservoir, Pavatkulam Reservoir, Lower Malwathu Oya Reservoir and North Central Provincial Canal projects.
After the Strategic Environmental Assessment is complete, a detailed report would be submitted to President Maithripala Sirisena in order to take further action regarding the said projects.

A mothers odyssey
Good Friday dawned. On this sad day, shall we be with my beloved son was on his way up to Calvary. I followed him. James, John, Peter, Mary of Magdala and a few others were with me. It was unbearable. He was carrying a heavy piece of timber on his shoulders. Bent low, face wreathed in pain. But calm. How many times had I applied oil on his shoulders after He had helped Joseph in carrying heavy pieces of logs into our workshop He would always say Thank you mother with a massive hug. How I loved that hug. Peter came up to me yes I said I know about it, but I know that He loves you very much. Peter kept his head on my shoulders Not once Mary, but thrice. He cried bitterly. I heard that Pontius Pilate had washed his hands during my boys so called trial, had said that he has nothing to do with this innocent man. He had wanted to release Him. But he had to give into the scribes and pharisees lest he be reported to Rome. Fear made him go against his conscience. I felt sorry for him amidst my grief.
My darling son fell. He was in great pain. Hunger, thirst, the scourging, the hideous crown of thorns caused my lovely son to fall. They got an outsider, Simon the Cyrenian to help him. An order, He obeyed. I ran upto him. A soldier approached me, his whip raised, either to strike me or my son.
He wanted no delays. My son turned His head and smiled at him. The soldier, gazed at him for some time, lowered his whip and backed away. I went upto him.What more grief can a mother endure than to see her innocent only child on his way to death. He looked at me and smiled. That smile, it is the same even though now grown up. The smile when we chided for making us so worried during our visit to temple in Jerusalem. The same when he smiled at me in Cana after acceding to my request. At my home, with his disciples he taught us to pray to His Father. Then, I recalled my own words Be it done to me according to thy word. Yes! He had completed going about his Fathers business and was on his final journey.
The solider with the whip gently led me away. Later, I heard my son had told some weeping women not to cry for him, but their children and their childrens children. We were at the foot of the cross. There was darkness all over. They stripped off his garments. Seeing ones own flesh and blood being subjected to this humiliation is unbearable. I closed my eyes. We were strangers to this place. Some were laughing. A few in tears, dare we to go against lawmakers and Rome.
Jesus my son was laid on the cross. How he wailed when those nails went into in his palms. They kept his feet together and sent a nail through them. He remained still. How many times had he caressed my face, the heads of the little children with those hands How many times had he raised his hand to heal the sick They were the same hands that were raised up to heaven teaching us pray to our heavenly Father. Most of all, I recollect how he used to keep me on his lap and embrace me when I told him about my concern towards him.
They raised the cross. Two convicts were strung up on crosses-one on his right, the other on the left. They were only tied to their crosses as was custom. My Jesus was nailed. To the soldiers this was a common occurrence. The one who preached about love and forgiveness was between the two who practiced violence.
I remember my son, looking at young John, then at me. Behold your sonhe said feebly. Next, Behold your mother. I suddenly felt so happy. I recalled those magnificent words of mine uttered thirty three years ago. My soul does magnify the Lord and that all generations shall call me blessed. I felt at that moment that he made me a mother for all generations. John read my thoughts. He embraced me so affectionately. My son was dying. He was gasping for breath. I thirst he said.
They held sponge fixed on to a spear, up to his mouth. It was vinegar. He was straining himself. His muscles were stretched. I looked away. Mary Magdalene put her arms round me and brought me close to her bosom. Then he shouted uttering these unforgettable words Father into thy hands I commend my spirit. Then my Jesus bowed his head and died.
I knew that this was going to be the beginning which will never ever have an end. We were standing there desolation and death all over. We were at the foot of the cross. Blood was still trickling down the cross. We took him down. They placed his lifeless body on my lap.
The following day was Sabbath. Early on the Sunday morning, I heard a shouting Mary they shouted our lord has risen from the dead. I was absolutely joyous. All of us went towards the sepulcher. It was empty. A young person had asked them why seek living among the dead then they knew. They knew in the most beautiful manner that my Jesus has risen from the dead. Me, a humble Jewish mother had been exalted to a position as no other mother in the world. Be it done to me according to your word.
This was the fountain of new life. How many will find a new life and live happily because of this life How many will lay down their lives in his name and of this new found life

M.T. FERNANDO  a soccer referee of world class
Any sport must have a judge, a referee or an umpire to have a watch as to how the game is played according to its rules and regulations.
Of all sports those who take to refereeing in football, rugby and hockey are the most hard worked, what with having to be up with the run of play, keeping pace with it and at the end of the game being able to gracefully accept the bouquets and brickbats.
The referees must be ever watchful that no infringements take place, but seeing that the players play the game clean, fair and square and however good a job referees perform they rarely come in for plaudits from players or the spectators.
One of the best produced
Among SPORTS LEGENDS there are not only players but referees. One, if not the best, produced in the country in football who could have been as good as any referee in the world was MANAGE TOMLIN FERNANDO.
FERNANDO, popularly known as MT had his early lessons in sport in the school by the Bambalapitya canal St.Peters College where he was an all round sportsman. The school did not pay much attention or encourage football preferring to rather concentrate and encourage cricket, rugby and athletics.
But FERNANDOs first love was football and rugby but in the little football that the school indulged in FERNANDO showed more than ordinary promise and was destined for greatness as a player and after his playing days were over, he took to refereeing and turned out into being an outstanding referee.
Fernandos teammates
Fernandos teammates at cricket at at SPC were Michael Chanmugam, Dion Walles, Aubrey Weinman and at rugby Ago Paiva, Harold Silva and Schokman brothers who later donned Havelocks rugby colours. However his first love was football, popularly called the poor mans game. From the first moment I met and got to know FERNANDO through my dear departed friend J.S.N. ANANDARAJA he impressed me as being dedicated and honest and his knowledge of most sports was fantastic, but it was in football that could be termed the Wisden to use cricketing parlance.
FERNANDO played football for Anuradhapura District in the CFA inter-district tournament. After serving in many posts in the countrys football administration, it was football that was fortunate to have him as secretary for two years, secretary Football Referees Association and as Chairman of The Referees Committee.
Thankless job
FERNANDO finally settled down to being a referee. The job is a thankless one. However good a job a referee performs, he is finally marked for brickbats, popularly called Hora referee and what is not sport even leaving himself open for assault.
Coming from a school that was popular for football, although it was in cricket that I excelled, football was my second love because SBC produced many champion teams and having arguably the best coach Albert Fernando who was the first to be pinned with Brazil Trainers License and later a German one.
There was no inter-school, club or international match that I would miss watching. Fights in Inter-school and club matches were more the rule rather than the exception, by losing side fans blaming the referee and even assaulting them. Refereeing was a risky job.
Natural talent
But from the referees I watched in action the best undoubtedly was FERNANDO. He had the natural talent for a referee and when the teams and spectators see him walk onto the field they would cheer him because they were convinced that he would perform a fair job to the satisfaction of the teams and the usually unruly spectators. In the late 1950s and '60s a referee who stood out was C.M. Mantara.
On refereeing heres a little anecdote. In those days when ever Saunders, Sunrise, Ratnam, Black Square, Victory, Eleven Lions SC or Kotahena Rangers played a match, after he game the referee came in for assault.
There was one referee who pretends to be struck by the spectators invading the field and would drop to the ground as if he has fainted.
Officials rush to his aid and do everything possible to revive him. But to no avail. And the joke was that when one official attempted to remove his wrist watch he recovered to every ones surprise.
Once he is escorted into the pavilion he would with a smile say that he dropped to the ground to save himself from assault.
Prince of Wales ground
In that era even the FA Cup or a game against any visiting international team was played at the Prince of Wales Ground adjoining which was then the 'kunumolay'- rubbish dumping ground - which V.A. Sugathadasa a former Benedictine and first Minister of Sport who later built and turned it into a stadium which now proudly stands the imposing Sugathadasa International Stadium that a former Saunders soccerite and keen soccer fan President Ranasinghe Premadasa built into international standard.
Also all important matches, even the FA Cup was played at the Army Ground, Echelon Square where now stands the Galadari Hotel. Even the Government Services ground where matches were played, but now stands the Cinnamon Hotel. Football has been given step motherly treatment. Thankfully now matches could be played also at the Old Race course Ground.
FERNANDO has the proud record of having been a FIFA referee for 10 years. He officiated in the first a AFC Asian Cup in Kuwait and the first to blow in the Presidents Cup in Korea. He also officiated in Thailand, Kuwait, UAE, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Germany and South Korea and on his quitting the game in appreciation of his good work was appointed a, AFAC Referee Instructor.
Treat to watch
Today thy game in the country lacks football lovers and referees of FERNANDOS calibre.
He was a treat to watch as a referee and players of that era commended and appreciated him for he was fearless and would never hesitate to blow up for an infringement however powerful the player or the club he came from.

Navy introduces new polythene, plastic recycling process
The Sri Lanka Navy Marine Conservation and Monitoring Unit has introduced a new polythene and plastic recycling process as a sustainable solution for garbage disposal in Sri Lanka.
This project consists of three phases and as its first phase; the production of items such as flower pots, fence posts and interlocks for gardens, had been tested. It was proven that such items could be produced with less effort.
During the second phase, it is expected to spread this technology countrywide, through the Naval Community Welfare Project and make the general public aware on the proper methods of garbage disposal and how to use garbage as a resource. Further, social organizations would be provided the necessary technical assistance in this regard.
It had been planned to conduct experiments to identify methods of disposing non-polythene/plastic garbage with the assistance of the Naval Research and Development Unit, under the third phase of the project and to introduce a polythene/plastic recycling machine by utlising injection-molding technology.
After giving thought to the current issues revolving around non-degradable waste, polythene and plastic which damage the environment, the Sri Lanka Navy introduced this new technology for the first time, after years of experimentation.
Accordingly, the process would be a suitable solution to effectively manage solid waste that withstands deterioration.
Under the directives of Navy Commander Vice Admiral Sirimevan Ranasinghe, this project was conducted with the supervision of Operations Director-General and Marine and Eco Friendly Projects Steering Committee Head Rear Admiral Piyal De Silva, Western Naval Area Commander Rear Admiral Nishantha Ulugetenne and Marine Surveillance Director Commodore Dammika Dias. The project was administered by Lieutenant Commander Aminda Kalupahana.

No room for foreign judges, Lankan delegation states
The Sri Lankan representation at the Geneva Human Rights Council has clearly stated that no foreign judges will be allowed to intervene with the judiciary of the country, Special Projects Minister Sarath Amunugama said.
He added that in accordance with the Constitution of Sri Lanka, there are no legal provisions to appoint foreign judges to inquire into allegations of human rights violations.
The Minister was addressing the media at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) headquarters, yesterday.
On the advice of President Maithripala Sirisena, the Sri Lankan delegation at the Geneva Human Rights Council session, clearly informed them that no foreign judges will be allowed to inquire into the so-called allegations of human rights violations. Whatever the decision taken, it should not be against the Constitution, Minister Amunugama said.
He added that no decision will be taken by the government which would go against the Constitution and impinges the sovereignty of the country.
We pointed out at the session that our judiciary is impartial and strong enough to inquire into those allegations. No one interferes with the judiciary and therefore, it is impartial and unbiased, he said.
The Minister added that the Sri Lankan delegation had expressed their displeasure at the sessions that human rights violation allegations are levelled against Sri Lanka annually at Geneva Sessions even after 10 years had elapsed after terrorism was eradicated.
It is nearing 10 years after eradicating LTTE terrorism. Even though the government has taken several measures to strengthen human rights, certain parties level human rights allegations against the country even today. This is unacceptable. We express our displeasure and mentioned that it should end soon, he said.
He added that Sri Lankas law and order is exercised properly and impartially. Therefore, there is no need of inquiring into the human rights situation of the country annually at the Geneva Convention.
However, it can be observed that certain foreign personnel, who work in the human rights sector, want to drag this further, he noted.
The Minister said the Sri Lankan delegation at the Geneva session pointed out how the LTTE had propagated terrorism by introducing suicide jackets, suicide bombings and other methods of genocide to the world.

NZ captain Williamson defends Warner as not a bad guy
CHRISTCHURCH March: New Zealand captain Kane Williamson defended David Warner Thursday, describing the Australian at the heart of the ball-tampering scandal as not a bad guy.
With New Zealand's build-up to the second Test against England, starting in Christchurch on Friday, overshadowed by international reaction to the cheating affair in South Africa, Williamson said he has been in touch with Warner.
It's a shame. The act is not condoned in any team, Williamson said after Warner was named as the instigator of the ball tampering.
It will blow over in time, but it's grown and grown and, like I say, he's not a bad guy. He's made a mistake and certainly admitted that and they are disappointed with that action. In the fallout from the ball-tampering, Cricket Australia have banned Warner and captain Steve Smith from all professional cricket for 12 months, and Cameron Bancroft for nine months.
Smith has been suspended from the captaincy for at least two years, while Warner has been told he will never lead an Australia side again.
Williamson described the punishment as strong, but defended Warner as a person.
He's not a bad person by any means. They (Warner and Smith) have made a mistake, they have certainly admitted that and they are disappointed with that action so they will have to take that punishment, strong punishment that it is, said Williamson.
But it's a shame that two fantastic world class players made a mistake. Lehmann admits the culture in the Australian side needs to change and held up New Zealand as an example of how to play and respect the opposition.
Under former captain Brendon McCullum and coach Mike Hesson New Zealand adopted a hard but fair approach in the fair-play traditions of the game.
We take pride in our performance, in the way we go about things and we want to continue to do that, said Williamson, who is regarded in cricket circles as a gentleman who adheres to the traditions of the game. - AFP

Pathfinder Foundation hosts Trincomalee  Consultations 2018  conference
Following the successful first regional conference held in 2017 under the theme Regional Cooperation for Economic Prosperity and Maritime Security in the Bay of Bengal, Trincomalee Consultations - 2018 was conducted by The Pathfinder Foundations Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives recently in Colombo.
The event, convened in collaboration with two New Delhi based think tanks Carnegie India and Vivekananda International Foundation, was sponsored by Japan. The theme of the conference was A Secure and Safe Bay of Bengal for Common Development and Prosperity.
The chief guest, State Minister of Defence, Ruwan Wijewardene, delivered the opening address focusing on the role of Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal and wider Indian Ocean. The keynote speaker Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy,highlighted the need for integration of the Bay of Bengal countries for common prosperity under a rule-based framework. Fumio Shimizu, Deputy Director General, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan spoke about Japanese interests in the Bay of Bengal and on-going cooperation between Japan and Sri Lanka. Admiral Anil Chopra, Member of National Advisory Security Board of India emphasized the critical importance of stability in Indias neighbourhood to its prosperity and the need for enhancing maritime governance and security. The welcome address was delivered by Bernard Goonethilleke, Chairman, thePathfinder Foundation.
Ambassador of Japan Kenchi Sugunuma; High Commissioner of Bangladesh Riaz Hamidulla;Sumith Naknadala, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who was former Secretary General of BIMSTEC;Deputy High Commissioner for India, Arindam Bagchi; Deputy High Commissioner for Australia Tim Huggins; Former Commander of the Army, General Daya Rathnayake; Former Commander of Sri Lanka Navy, Admiral Jayantha Perera; former Vice Chanceller of KDU, Major General Milinda Peiris; Director of Bandaranaike Center for International Studies Dr. Harinda Vidanage; Luxman Siriwardena and K Balasndaram representing Pathfinder Foundation, and Ms. Imogen Canavan ofMax Planck Foundation (Germany) were among those who graced the occasion. Countries attending the event were Bangladesh, India, Japan, Myanmar, Nepal, Singapore and Sri Lanka.
As determined during the first round, three research projects were undertaken by subject specialists on three broad areas viz. (i) Unfolding geo-strategic significance and assessing the regional security cooperation demands in the Bay of Bengal Region; (ii) Examine the current state of cooperation among the countries in the Bay of Bengal Region in maritime transportation, aviation and other sectors of economic activity; and(iii)Potential for developing Trincomalee as a regional hub for shipping, aviation and other sectors of economic activity to serve the Bay of Bengal Region and develop a way forward for further enhancement of cooperation.
Based on this research work, three sessions were conducted with the participation of Indian, Japanese and Sri Lankan scholars with the participation of Mr. Rohan Masakorala, Dr Terney Pradeep Kumara, Commodore Y N Jayarathna, Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage, Ms. Darshana Baruah (Carnegie India) Captain Rohan Joseph and professor Go Ito(Japan). Papers were also presented by Dr. Dan Malaka Gunasekera, Sumith Nakandala, Rear Admiral Anwarul Islam(Bangladesh), Commodore Somen Banerjee (India), Dr. Naing Swe Oo (Myanmar) and Dr. Rani Mullen (ISAS-Singapore) on BIMSTEC and country perspectives on the Bay of Bengal Region on connectivity, security and other related issues
The Indian Ocean Region is home to nearly one-third of worlds population and is of high economic and strategic significance due to its location and traffic that passes through it. It is estimated that nearly half of worlds containers, one third of bulk cargo traffic and two thirds of oil shipments pass through the Indian Ocean.
Further, there is a shift in global economic weight and influence from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to Indo-Asia-Pacific. Rise of China to number two and India to number sixth position in the world economic order is a clear example of this shift. With a growing population in India and China, there will be a requirement to produce and trade more. Therefore, the Indian Ocean has become the key ocean for energy, trade and food security. These developments have led to a new interest in the freedom of navigation.
The Indian Ocean is part of global commons and many major trading nations such as the USA, Japan, China, South Korea, Australia and some a number of other countries have shown their interest in this ocean. There are also some politically and security-wise unstable states in the Indian Ocean, which add to the volatility of maritime security.
Also, presence of non-state actors such as pirates, terrorists, hijackers, IUU fishers, religious extremists, and smugglers of weapons/narcotics/humans, in some parts of the Indian Ocean make maritime security a complex scenario.
Occupying a central location in the Indian Ocean and having cordial relations with other states in the region, Sri Lanka has a unique advantage in bringing scholars, practitioners and think-tanks from across the Indo-Asia Pacific region to discuss a wide variety of topics such as connectivity, maritime domain awareness (MDA) and oceanology research, focusing on the Bay of Bengal Region.
The Pathfinder Foundation plans to conduct the next regional conference on maritime governance and security issues in the Indian Ocean in 2019.

Peace through drama
The Workshop Players are a group of thespians that deliver powerful and exceptional performances. They are a theatre outfit that have conquered the stage. Recently the workshop players celebrated World Theatre Day at the British Council. To celebrate this day the Workshop Players delivered performances based from Excerpts from Les Miserables, Lion King and Antony and Cleopatra.
Workshop players Andre Howson (Antony) and Piorina Fernando (Cleopatra) delivered an absolutely professional, dynamic and classy performance of Antony and Cleopatra that involved exchanges between the Roman Military Commander Mark Antony and the charismatic Cleopatra. The passion and the intensity was brought out well by the extremely talented duo that did justice to the World Theatre Day.
Artistic Director of Workshop Players Jerome De Silva, a larger than life personality in Sri Lankan theatre, was seen overlooking the entire evening as his thespians made him proud by their superb acting.
The Workshop Players, one of Sri Lankas foremost English theatre groups, is famed for bringing some of the best of Broadway musicals such as Oliver!, The Sound of Music, Evita, The Phantom of the Opera, Les Miserables and most recently the highly acclaimed My Fair Lady to the local stage. This non-profit organization made up of theatre lovers, aims to promote talent in all aspects of theatre while also using it as a vehicle to promote peace.
Founded on March 7, 1992, over the past 26 years hundreds of children, adolescents and adults from different theatre and personal backgrounds have been part of the WSP family. The WSP also have dedicated groups for Sinhala theatre productions and junior theatre productions.
The group functions under the philosophy of theatre with a purpose, and has tried to share their learning with young people from less privileged backgrounds and run workshops for theatre students in Colombo, Wadduwa, Alawwa, Batticaloa, Jaffna and Trincomalee.
The troupe is made-up of directors, actors, singers, dancers, musicians, choreographers, writers, composers, artists, designers, sound engineers, lighting designers and engineers, stage managers and backstage and front of house (FoH) crew. Several Workshoppers have gone on to successfully establish their own theatre companies while many of the troupe are also frequently found handling lights, sound and stage management for other companies.
Since its maiden production in January 1993, The Workshop Players have staged 16 plays in English and three in Sinhala, from musicals to straight plays, foreign to local plays and historical epics to contemporary fiction.
Artistic Director of Workshop Players Jerome De Silva, said that as Thespians World Theatre Day is their day. I am part of the Tower Hall Theatre Foundation and is the International Theatre Institute (ITI) center for Sri Lanka. When I went to the World Theatre conference last year, we discussed a lot of things and we felt that we were not doing enough in this country to warrant ITI membership. So I came back and dedicated the work of the Workshop players towards furthering that and bolstering the ITI center here at Tower Hall Theatre Foundation. World Theatre day is a big thing all over the world. Last year we celebrated it by doing Shakespeare in the Park. So it is good that we can involve people. If you take the situation in the world, theatre can cross all borders. So we are fighting for artists mobility. We have a voice in the United Nations. I am trying to make the Workshop Players an associate member of ITI, explained De Silva.
De Silvas message to people is to join hands with the theatre.
Lets go out and spread this message and make theatre accessible to everybody. And that is exactly what we are doing here. We are doing Antony and Cleopatra on April 7 and 8. We want to make World Theatre Day officially known to people, otherwise The Tower Hall does it only in the confines of the Tower Hall Theatre Foundation and no one knows. We have a voice in the United Nations. With all the walls that are being built, border walls and immigration problems and shutting out immigrants. Workshop Players is probably the biggest and the most active theatre group in the country, having crossed all borders, all nationalities with no racial issues and is the ideal group to take the message of World Theatre message of peace. It is great if we get associate membership, pointed out De Silva.
President Anoj Wijayaratne, pointed out that World Theatre Day in Sri Lanka is something that is largely unheard of. I think us partnering up with the British Council is definitely an important initiative when it comes to spreading the message out, saying that there is a World Theatre Day that exists. Because in Sri Lanka theatre is developing on a huge scale, in English and Sinhala. So in the plays done today, Hamlet was performed by the Tower Hall Theatre Foundation who we invited to come along and perform, and Les Miserables, Lion King and Antony and Cleopatra were done by the Workshop Players, said Wijayaratne.
Wijayaratne, started out with the Workshop Players with Jesus Christ Superstar, and then did Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables and My Fair Lady. For me Jesus Christ Superstar was the most memorable for me and I had a really great experience with the cast, said Wijayaratne.
Workshop Player Emmanuel Eze, is Nigerian who came to Sri Lanka in 2015, to study Electronic engineering and entered the workshop players by auditioning for My Fair Lady.
At first I thought theatre was lame, but it turned out to be one of the most amazing experiences in my life. And I found a second family. I love all of them and I would definitely advise anyone to take part in theatre at least once because it is a great experience. It is surprising how people from different walks in life can come together in unison and love each other because of their shared interest in drama. You get to spend time with each other and form a bond that is going to be there for a life time. This is one awesome family that I do not want to let go of, said Eze.
Praneeth Chanaka, is a close associate of Jerome De Silva who says that the workshop players are extremely resourceful and that they have great discipline.
At the Workshop Players you can learn a lot and it has nothing to do with money. You learn something of intrinsic value at Workshop Players. This applies to both English and Sinhala dramas. Working with Jerome and the workshop players opens up so many avenues for English and Sinhala thespian, said Chanaka.
Reihan Stevens has been part of the Workshop players since 2013. We are doing stuff from Shakespeare to Lion King and to Les Miserables. We are using this day as a vessel to promote the upcoming production of Antony and Cleopatra which is happening at Vihara Maha Devi open air theatre which is of the Shakespeare in the park initiative. This has grown by leaps and bounds. So it is basically spreading the word of theatre. So Sri Lanka has tremendous potential when it comes to theatre. What is great about the workshop players is that it has become a family for me. It is an outlet to express who I am and I love being on stage. I have done Jesus Christ Superstar, Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables and My Fair Lady.
I have done Bengal Bungalow with Jehan Aloysius and Peter Pan. It is a great experience being with the Workshop Players. You gain amazing friends, said Stevens.
Piorina Fernando felt that it certainly is a privilege to play the role of Cleopatra in what can be regarded as one of Shakespeares great tragedies  Antony and Cleopatra. I really embraced this opportunity when they were casting. I really love the productions the workshop players do. In school I did a lot of drama. I have a passion for drama that you cant really put into words. I have enjoyed the process thoroughly. Drama has given me a lot of confidence and brought me out of my shell. You learn so much and your character is built and you become part of a family, she said.
Mayanthi De Silva, who has been in the Workshop Players since 2014,described drama as a life choice. It is great that Sri Lanka has a drama culture and we have drama available and a lot of people dont realize how educational it is and what change it can do. It is a vehicle of change. It is important to understand that you have to keep the aesthetic part of you alive, because that is what will keep you happy and keep you grounded, said De Silva.
Dramatist Andre Howson who played the character of Caesars General Mark Antony said that theatre is a wonderful way of showing the human condition. You are able to bring out emotion and stories that people can relate to. We study the mood and the emotion and the intention behind the words and try and bring that out. You try to be as authentic as possible. Drama has made me more aware of how people think. It has given me greater control over how I speak and behave and made me more confident. Antony and Cleopatra is one of the biggest plays you can ever do in Shakespeare. There is so much story in this and so much passion, said Howson.

Peacekeepers deployed after thorough screening: Army
The attention of the Sri Lanka Army has been drawn to news reports pertaining to delays in the deployment of peacekeepers.
In a press release, the Sri Lanka Army stated that it "considers it important that the personnel deployed in UN missions at all levels (e.g. Military staff officers, experts, observers, liaison officers etc.) should be individuals of the highest integrity and maintain the highest standards of conduct at all times. In their respective roles in UN missions, they will not only be flag bearers for the United Nations but for Sri Lanka as well."
The release added: "As you would be aware, there have been certain instances in the past where personnel from Sri Lanka deployed in UN missions have not maintained the standards expected of them and disciplinary action has had to be taken in accordance with the relevant and applicable legal provisions.
There have also been instances when personnel nominated for deployment have been found to have allegations of misconduct against them.
"Sri Lanka, at present, seeks to enhance and expand its participation in UN peacekeeping. Such expansion of Sri Lanka's participation which would entrust Sri Lanka Security Forces with responsibilities of an international scale have to be carried out in coordination and in cooperation with the United Nations and Sri Lanka's bilateral partners, and it is the responsibility of the sending country (i.e. Sri Lanka) to ensure that the personnel deployed are Sri Lanka's best."
"We are mindful, therefore, of the need to provide them pre-deployment training including in conduct and discipline, and awareness-raising regarding the investigation and disciplinary measures that they would be compelled to face if they do not comply with the high standards expected of them in their respective international roles," the Army stated.
The Army release added that all agencies in Sri Lanka consider the country's reform agenda of good governance, right to information, the rule of law, and human rights with due seriousness. Greater engagement with the international, rule community and assuming greater responsibility in the international arena is a part of this reform agenda. In this context, in the field of peacekeeping, Sri Lanka seeks to work with the United Nations to set standards and examples for other States to consider following as well.
"Screening of personnel being deployed at all levels is an important component in this respect. In this connection, the Sri Lanka Army considers setting up a mechanism with the participation of the independent national mechanism that has been set up through Parliament which is empowered by the Constitution of our country  i.e. The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka - as the most appropriate way forward with respect to the screening of personnel.
Accordingly, the Sri Lanka Army, following discussions with the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the United Nations, and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka has agreed on a process to be followed for the screening of all personnel being deployed on UN assignments. This national process is in line with the UN Secretary  General's Decision No. 2012/18 Human Rights screening of United Nations Personnel of 11 December 2012 which requires the Member States to screen their personnel and certify that the individuals who are nominated or deployed have not been involved in violations.
"We firmly believe that this national process that has been set in place will help raise the standards of conduct and discipline of Sri Lanka's Army even further in future, and it is our objective to ensure that personnel belonging to the Sri Lanka Army at home and abroad always maintain the highest standards of discipline and conduct, earning the trust and confidence of those that they serve," the release said.

Police commence investigations into Maskeliya violence
Police have launched investigations in the Maskeliya and Norwood areas, to apprehend those responsible for the recent clashes that took place at the Maskeliya town on Wednesday (28). No arrests had been made so far.
The Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) and the National Union of Workers (NUW), who had been locking horns over establishing local governments in the Nuwara-Eliya district, had their supporters break into violent clashes over the appointment of a chairman to the Maskeliya Pradeshiya Sabha.
Five persons including three members of the Norwood Pradeshiya Sabha, were admitted to the Dickoya Hospital on Wednesday evening.
As a vote was taken to appoint a chairman to the Maskeliya Pradeshiya Sabha on Wednesday afternoon, a member of the United National Party (UNP) was absent from sessions. NUW members alleged that the CWC had paid her, kept her hidden and not allowed her to come to the council to vote.
This caused a tense situation between the two parties. The confrontation which then turned into violent clashes, had the Special Task Force (STF) called to the council to control the situation. The members however, continued to throw stones at each other.
Though the STF managed to disperse the crowd, they had then once again clashed at Norwood town, damaging two vehicles. One of the damaged vehicles had belonged to a Central Province CWC member.

Port City and the future of Sri Lanka
Proper engineering studies were done prior to commencing the Colombo Port City project said Chief Sales and Marketing Officer of Port City Colombo, Liang Thow Ming.
Ming further said that two of their coastal engineering consultants, spent a year studying the wave patterns before getting to the drawing boards. This was to make sure that the project does not affect the North and South shores of Colombo, he said.
These views were expressed by Liang Thow Ming in a recent seminar organized by the Organization of Professionals Association (OPA) of Sri Lanka at their Auditorium in Colombo.
He was invited to make the presentation on the mega investment project under the topic Port City and the future of Sri Lanka.
Addressing the gathering, Liang Thow Ming likened the large stretch of Port City land, once properly reclaimed, to a blank sheet of paper which one could freely draw upon, (meaning, plan). He said that it should be seen as an opportunity to create one of the top cities in the world right here in Sri Lanka which every Lankan could be proud of.
He said, the Port City project is also huge from a local context, in terms of size it would have 21,000 units of apartments, as well as increasing the currently available office space in Colombo to 5 times that i.e. from 300,000 to 1.5 million square meters.
However, in comparison with other global projects, we are not large; the Palm Jumeirah is 2 times the size of the Port City and the Marina Bay in Singapore is 330 hectares which is 15 percent larger. However, we have the opportunity to be the best in this region. So, we, together with the government, have tried to strategize this, and what we want to do is actually target Port City toward the whole of South Asia, he says.
Fielding questions from the audience he gave reasons as to why Sri Lanka is ideal for this project, pointing to his presentation and the concentric circles around the island, each representing just one hour of flying time from the Katunayake airport, Liang said. If you look at the first circle, and the second circle, by the time we have reached the second circle, we would have covered the 5 southernmost provinces of India. And the population there is 450 million.
Then in another half an hour you can go to Mumbai and in three and a half hours to New Delhi, three and a half hours to cities like Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and get to Dubai in a little more than 4 hours. This is what the Prime Minister was talking about when he said Sri Lanka will be able to fill the void of a financial city between Dubai and Singapore; because we are right in the middle.
Speaking about the Belt Road Initiative (BRI), he said it was divided into two parts i.e. one part which was over land and the other which is over the ocean. The one over land is referred to as the belt and the one over the ocean is called the road. We are smack in the middle of the road and we are also in the center of shipping routes between Africa and Asia as well as Europe and Asia, which is the reason why Colombo is the top port in South Asia.
Colombo on the other hand has been hailed as the most livable city in South Asia he adds, quoting a statistic provided by Mercer. And I agree that Colombo is very good and very beautiful, but what we need to do in the Port City will be a quantum leap. 
The Chief Marketing Officer said that through the development of an interchange of expressways, driving to any part of the country would be much easier.
People would be able to drive down to Hambantota, to Kandy, to the airport because it would literally link to the entire network of expressways in Sri Lanka. Recently we signed an MoU with the government to create this tunnel system, which will link our Northern and Southern entrances. And with this tunnel we are going to create some more entryways to the Port City and then there are also plans to extend the tunnel all the way to Marine Drive. Once the tunnels are built, Galle Face Green will be extended by another 20 - 30 meters once it is complete; which means you have a bigger area to play in.
Referring to the light rail system proposed by the government, he says that 7 lines in total are being planned. Twoof these lines are in a more advanced stage of planning right now. The RTS 1 will run from Fort all the way to Bambalapitiya and the RTS 4 will run from the same place to West Malabe. They will both have a station in Pettah, which is on a future development proposed by the government to make a multi-modal transport hub. He says that once this was done all they would need to do would be to have a line from the multimodal transport hub running into the Port City. We will develop 5 stations over there as well, he says.

President urged to retain CSD Director General
A group of Civil Security Department (CSD) personnel had appealed to President Maithripala Sirisena to refrain from transferring CSD Director General Chandraratna Pallegama until their probation period is complete and almost 39,000 CSD personnel receive their letters of permanency.
The letter signed by the heads of relevant districts said the President had kept his promise and fulfilled a pledge made to the CSD personnel to grant them permanency and avail the almost 39,000 personnel to receive a pension.
On the day that the President completed his 100 days in office on April 4, 2015, all arrangements were made to grant permanent employment status to the employees who were on a daily wage basis at the time.
Having rendered a great service to the country during the war as a support service to the forces, they were unable to obtain a loan or own a house as they were employed on a daily wage basis.
However, having being made permanent employees of the CSD, mainly through the efforts of the President and CSD Director General Chandraratne Pallegama, today, they are able to live comfortably with their families.
However, their probation period is scheduled to end on April 23 and their letters of permanency are to be handed over to them on that day.
Therefore, they urged the President to allow the current DG Pallegama to remain in his post at the CSD until the process of making these employees permanent is completed.

Public Trustee gets nod to open 252 last wills
The Colombo District Court yesterday issued an order directing the Public Trustees Department that 252 last wills pertaining to colossal amount of wealth which were under the Public Trustees supervision be produced before court on April 23.
Colombo Additional District Judge Chamath Madanayaka made this order pursuant to a request made by incumbent Public Trustee Sanath Weeratne.
In his application, the Public Trustee informed court that persons who bequeathed their last wills in the custody of the Public Trustee between 1932 and 1992 have to be opened to fulfill their wishes.
The plaintiff stated that former public trustees have not taken action regarding these last wills. He requested that they be opened under District Court supervision.
Presidents Counsel Ikram Mohammed appearing for the Weeratne told court that the amount of wealth in possession of those last wills could exceed one billion rupees.
The last will is a document by which a living person states the manner in which his property should be handled and by whom such property should be inherited after his death.

Ragging  perennial issue of a vicious cycle!
In response to the article titled Ragging, a psychological phenomenon which appeared in the citizens mail of Daily News of March 21, I wish to convey some of my thoughts as well following a survey on the matter.
This brutal physical and psychological menace deeply embedded into the sub-culture of the present universities is introduced to the students as a process of flexionizing or socializing. But the fact remains that the real problem lies in this so-called process with its unethical and violent activities.
In this systematic form of abuse, it is most disturbing to note inhuman acts perpetrated by sadistic seniors such as abusive, obnoxious and threatening words to frighten and humiliate juniors in public, stripping them naked in the hostels and gender-based sexual abuse, kneeling them down in the scorching sun for a long time, keeping them in hunger on certain days, severe assaults on them and on the day of welcome party to bathe them with water mixed with dirt and urine etc. The gravity of this problem even worsens in the Higher Educational Institutes and Universities outside the Western Province.
I clearly see ragging as a manifestation of vicious attitudes, frustration, jealousy, inferiority complex, socio-economic disparity, lack of socialization of disgruntled elements directed towards good looks and superior personality, better socio-economic, socio-academic backgrounds and even fluency in English of freshers.
This makes me all the more convinced as there are disciplined senior students representing respectable family environments who are not in agreement with this sort of corporal and psychological harassment by the miscreants.
I believe that spreading comprehensive awareness of the aspects of ragging could play an important role in awakening the mass support in order to curb and curtail the cruelty of ragging. Nevertheless, there is little chance for the victims to report their predicament to either parents/guardians or university authorities due to fear inflicted on them in different forms by the raggers.
Ragging leads to serious consequences not only for the victims and their parents, but its effects negatively impact the entire society. The students from the affluent backgrounds may join private universities or go abroad for their studies causing a huge brain drain and financial loss to the country while the children of poor parents must try to bear up the stress and strain at the expense of their physical, mental and psychological well-being. These traumatic health issues, without doubt, create a loss of self-worth and sickness even resulting in the extreme step of suicide by the victims. In such a gloomy scenario, how can the parents possibly send their children to Government Universities Arent the promising careers our children dream of nipped in the bud
In my opinion, though authorities of the Universities and the U.G.C. are aware of the enormity and gravity of the issue of ragging and various measures recommended by concerned quarters seasonally to deal with the problems, they have not intervened satisfactorily to implement a proper mechanism on ragging so far. It should be noted that ragging is nurtured by the conception that one becomes a senior simply because one arrives somewhere first and each year every senior batch rags the next batch of junior students which repeats in a vicious cycle.
Thus, there must be a proper policy and mechanism so as not to repress merely the superficial aspects of the problem while preserving its roots intact. In other words, the ill-effects of ragging, if not cured, may grow into a chronic incurable social disease.

Re-authorised US GSP for SL from April
The re-authorised US GSP shall become active for Lankan exporters from this April, according to Sri Lankas Minister of Industry and Commerce. Meanwhile, Lankan exports to US is now almost at $ 3 billion threshold for the first time.
We thank the US government for renewing their GSP support to Sri Lanka. This initiative greatly strengthens relations with our biggest trade partner in the world and helps not only our exporters but US importers and US consumers as well. Officials of my Department of Commerce have informed me that the re-authorised US GSP shall become active for Lankan exporters as early as April 22 said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen during his meeting with top Ministry officials yesterday.
US President Donal Trump re-authorised US GSP facility for 120 beneficiary countries (which was not renewed in December 2017) when he signed the US Omnibus Spending Bill on 23 March. His re-authorisation opens opportunities for around 5000 products to be imported to US without tariff from 120 developing countries.
US has been the leading buyer of Lankan exports over the years and it continued its lead even last year. Sri Lankas total exports to US last year was almost notching $3 Bn threshold at US$ 2.9 Billion. This is a growth of 3.65% from 2016s $2.8 Billion. The second largest buyer of Lankan exports last year was UK at $ 1.03 Billion and the third, was India at $689 Million. Apparel products are Sri Lankas biggest export item to US, taking around 70-75% of annual exports. Total US-Sri Lanka trade (both exports and imports) in 2016 was US $3.3 Billion.
Sri Lanka will now benefit from the renewed US GSP Scheme until 31 December 2020. Since the effective date of the renewal is 22nd April 2018, Lankan exports to USA under the GSP Scheme will be eligible for tariff concession after 22nd April 2018. However the US importers are eligible to claim customs duties they had to pay during the period of inactive GSP (from January 1, 2018 to April 22, 2018) due to the retroactive effect of US Presidents renewal.

Red Cross Marks   write wrongs  or right wrongs
Rainbows violet says majesty - red says vulnerability
Coming here as man, bear injustice suffering ignominy
Red Cross marks man did to man became mine Cross
Unite races heal peoples oer ancient divides and dross

What do you do with wrongs of others
How strongly do you mark them foul
By the mark you made - others in kind return
Tit for tat and butter for fat
You kicked my dog I kill your cat
Society is red to the teeth
Politics academics theatrics
There was One who turned his cheek
Gave His back to the plough
To Him my wrongs all bow
Lay not this charge to their account
I will pay - my merit for them count

Its my turn to receive the whip I put on others
I cry for mercy hoping to prevent just deserts
As you sow you reap; which throne do you go
Mercy or wrath- accordingly paid good or woe

Teacher takes red pen hastily to mark
He knows the boys a crook so stark
Readily hand forms to cross the sum
He never gets it right and never will
All his life this rascal will go wrong
Teacher puts a hex thatll vex him long
Boy ends in jail none helps to raise his head
Teachers own son is with him in the cell

He without sin cast the first stone
For stones boomerang get your own
Oppressor today victim tomorrow
Prosecutor turns accused next day
Wheels of justice surely grind
Grace and mercy is better to find
Sword of Damocles not on my head
If I forgive as God forgave my debt
Shylocks pound hemlock deathly brew
Give not another, in your own juice you stew

Roman whips and crown of thorns crucifixion agony
Vividly portrayed mans cruelty and human villainy
Montague and Capulet world over kill love and beauty
Resurrection morning proclaimed Mercys Victory

Engrave on heart of stone or erase with kindness
Marks that come on the lives of fellow travellers
Write a wrong so easy, right a wrong needs mercy

The way you choose gives back dividends aplenty
Between majestic violet and the vulnerable red
God comes in Green giving life to spiritually dead
Blue is omnipresence yellow wisdom from heaven
Orange says change new fruit for a new season

Season of new life
We are in the season of Easter - the season of new life. As Christians we know that Easter is the foundation of our faith. For our meditation on Easter, I would like to ask you three questions. What is Easter How do we understand Easter And what is the meaning of Easter for us today
What is Easter We know that after the death of Jesus his disciples wee frightened and stayed in the upper room. According to the gospel stories some of the disciples went back to their former professions. They were helpless and hopeless. They did not have the courage to come out. Although physically they were alive, morally they were dead. They thought everything was over.
On the first Easter day they realized that Jesus who had been crucified on that Friday had risen from the dead. The evil forces that crucified him could not confine him to the grave. Early Christians met the resurrected Jesus whenever they broke bread and shared the cup, remembering the death, resurrection of Jesus Christ.
How do we understand Easter Easter was possible because of the death of Jesus. There is no resurrection without death. What does this mean Often as Christians we talk and boast about the resurrection. We pronounce that we believe in the glorified Jesus who is resurrected and alive. We use the message of his resurrection to prove that Christians are victorious. There is nothing wrong in all these things. But we should always remember that resurrection is inseparable from death. Or in other words, resurrection began with death. Here I dont mean only physical death. Jesus death began at his birth. When God became a man his death began. He offered His life as a living sacrifice. The cross became the summit of that sacrifice.
He emptied himself for the growth of all others. Here we see that in the life of Jesus death was the depth of life. His life was centered on others instead of self-centered. This story is very well explained in the letter to the Philippians where the writer says that although Jesus had the very nature of God he emptied himself and became a slave and he was obedient unto death. Therefore, God raised him and glorified His name above all names. In Greek this emptying is called Kenosis.
What is the meaning of Easter for us today The meaning of Easter for Christian life is seen in Christian baptism. When a person is baptised, we expect that the Old Adam in him or her, will be buried, and a new humanity will be raised in him or her with Christ. At Baptism we become partakers of the resurrection of Christ. That is why at baptism we say that we renounce all evil things. To experience resurrection with Christ we have to get rid of our self-centered, selfish and introvert lives. When you are ready to give up wealth, money, time and so on for the growth and welfare of others there springs out the hope of resurrection. Look at our environment and surroundings. We enjoy spring because the trees are able to give up their old leaves, their old appearance. It is not a coincidence that Easter and spring come together.
Resurrection is not something of the past. It is a present reality. Look at the life of a person like Nelson Mandela of South Africa. He was in prison for nearly thirty years. His suffering was not in vain. His sufferings contributed to the freedom of people in South Africa, especially the black. When people suffer for the redemption of others, there spring out hope of resurrection.
Mother Theresa of Calcutta is another example of this. By sacrificing her life for so many people she gave us a glimpse of resurrection. In Korea there is a Theologian called Am Pyoma. He says that he sees the resurrected body of Jesus in the struggling masses who seek liberation. St. Paul met this Jesus on his way to Damascus. That voice asked him why do you persecute me. Paul did not persecute Jesus but he persecuted the resurrected body of Jesus, which was his church. This enabled him to teach us that the Church is the body of Christ.
As Christians we should always remember that we are the resurrected body of Christ. We are his arms, legs, eyes, ears and so on. Therefore, as members of his resurrected body, let us commit ourselves to work for the liberation of his people from various bondages.

SLSC marks 75th anniversary with international symposium
A multifaceted showpiece of advanced Information Communication Technology (ICT) and the professionalism on cyber space the Sri Lanka Signal Corps (SLSC) of the Army possesses, will remain open to the world when the SLSC marks its 75th anniversary with a well-timed international symposium, themed, 'Cyber Space; Perpetual Battlefront for Future' and the mega 'Wave' ICT Exhibition at the BMICH premises during November 28-29.
A media conference to announce the SLSC 75th anniversary commemoration arrangements, headed by Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, took place this afternoon (28) at Hotel Hilton, flanked by Director General, Directorate of Research Analysis Project and Development Major General Renuka Rowel (Rtd), Colonel Commandant SLSC Major General Ajith Wijesinghe, Director Information Technology Brigadier Prabath Dematampitiya and several other senior officers.
Making another distinguished landmark shift in the Army's stance from its conventional 'Threat-based' perception to that of a 'Capacity-based' one, Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake attending the media meet as the Chief Guest said that the SLSC could take the lead in propagating new innovative improvements to the cyber space as the latest technologically-advanced 6th dimension of war, unlike in past warfares with land, naval or air troops, etc.
"It is clear that changes in warfare are of different nature and Sri Lanka, though small in size should be prepared to take any challenge in cyber space which is also a form of soft power. Security to information, transmission of information, sensitive information is getting more and more prominence day by day. Hence unlike in the past we have to always mould an Army, based on 'capacity' rather than the 'threat' since Information Technology is ruling the day as the most powerful communicative tool. Media too can contribute to this awareness and the importance of technology," the Commander said.
Colonel Commandant, SLSC Major General Ajith Wijesinghe, making the inaugural contribution to the conference told that the SLSC as the IT and communication arm of the Army is now well structured and technologically poised to take on any future challenge in cyber space, warfare or IT as the country's trailblazer in the field of signals.
"As a descendent of the Royal Signals Corps under the British in 1943, the SLSC being one of the oldest regiments had done a landmark service to the nation very silently, particularly during the times of internal threats and insurgencies. It is now a highly intergrated organization extending from communication to IT, and then to cyber having seven Field Signal Regiments, two IT Regiments, one Repair and Maintenance Regiment, one Cyber Security Regiment, one Electronic Warfare Squadron and School of Signals Training. The SLSC is now poised to take on the challenges in Command, Control, Communication, Computer, Cyber and Intelligence (C51) in the new millennium since the cyber space is the perpetual battlefront for future", Major General Wijesinghe said.
Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, on the same occasion launched the 75th anniversary official logo and the anniversary website. Special tokens of appreciations were also presented to the main sponsors of anniversary events, the symposium and the exhibition.
A considerable number of military and civil ICT professionals at international level have been invited to the ICT symposium and representatives from England, Russia, China, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have already confirmed their participation, the media gathering was told.
This inaugural discourse for intellectual brainstorming, designed to discuss a diverse range of ICT issues, will pave the way for the Army to further enhance Army's ICT and Cyber capabilities, realizing the potentials at international levels.
The two-day symposium namely the: WAVE would focus on "Cyber Space; Perpetual Battlefront for Future", and will consist of several sessions (November 28-29) at the BMICH.

The annual one day game between Wariyapola Sri Sumangala (St. Pauls) College and Sri Rahula College will be played at the Pallakelle Stadium today.
In this game it will be interesting to see how the deadly bowlers of Sri Rahula perform against run hungry Sri Sumangala cricketers.
The Sri Rahula bowlers who have picked up some good wickets this season will find it difficult to contain the Sri Sumangala batsmen.
Sri Sumangala, who has a strong batting line up, should pile up a formidable score if they get the chance to bat first. Sri Rahula too have a dashing batting line up and should give a firm challenge.

Tackling racial hatred
National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan has proposed the disbanding of all schools based on race and religion, which he says has only gone on to promote and foster racial and religious bigotry. He says he will forward a Cabinet paper shortly aimed at completely doing away with schools that are operated on race or religious identities in order to halt young minds being polluted with racial and religious prejudices, and instead promote amity and concord among members of different religions and races. The Minister was of the view that race based schools foster communal discord and that preventive measures have to be taken to deescalate the rising tide of communal and racial prejudices.
Many would agree with the Minister who is doing much these days to foster and promote communal harmony through the various programmes conducted by his ministry. He is apparently attempting to tackle the malaise of communal hatred at the source. No doubt, implanting communal ill will among schoolchildren at a tender age is bound to get magnified with the passage of time leading to grave repercussions. The CID investigations into the recent communal violence in Kandy also revealed that schoolchildren had been involved in circulating hate speech via social media. Even during the July, 83 riots, students of some leading schools in the city actively took part in the arson attacks in the heart of Colombo, while in school uniform.
Therefore, inculcating the virtue of peaceful co-existence among schoolchildren cannot be overemphasized in the present day. Teachers and elders have an important role to pay in this connection. Regrettably though, more often than not, the communal mindset of children are the legacies of the parents who find it difficult to suppress their racial prejudices which unfortunately rubs off on their offspring. Certain heroic deeds of kings, contained in history lessons taught in schools, in past, where the conquest of one race by another was emphasized also, no doubt, went on to make a big impression on young minds, leading to the cultivation of a superiority complex and tendency to look down upon the other race. Sadly, even certain members of the Sangha tend to harp on the past glories of a single race that goes onto exacerbate feelings of racial superiority. Hence, not just in the schools, the malaise of racial bigotry should be tackled on all fronts if we are to eradicate racial and religious intolerance and promote amity among the different communities.
Schools identified with a religion and/or community, though, cannot be disbanded overnight. To begin, with the founders of these schools meant it to be that way. Buddhists would not like to see a premier educational institution such as Ananda be supplanted by a school having children of a mixed bag of religions or races. Similarly, the old boys of S.Thomas' would not like to see their school diluted in any way that would affect its identity as a leading Anglican school. Ditto for schools such as Zahira, and, or, the leading Catholic schools.
Besides, demographies too has to be taken into account. For instance, it would be well nigh impossible to try the minister's experiment in schools in the North where one particular race predominate. A common denominator too would not work in most areas in the South with a high concentration of Buddhists.
The ideal way to promote communal and religious harmony is for those strident communal voices on both sides of the divide to come down from their hard line positions and instead show the way for peaceful co-existence, themselves. Politicians and religious leaders can take the lead.
But are we asking for too much If one were to go by immediate post war scenario it is difficult to expect politicians to shed their communal prejudices. Victory parades were held ad nausm relegating the Tamils to a conquered race. Gung ho speeches were made by the leaders of the day that were blatantly racist. Not only that. The singing of the National Anthem in Tamil was banned at functions in schools and government offices in the North. All efforts were made to emphasize the superiority of a single race to the total exclusion of the other. No amount of multi-racial or multi-religious schools will succeed in changing the status quo so long as politicians and members of clergy openly or subtly promote racial intolerance in the manner that is happening today.
With the present communication revolution, it goes without saying that it is all too easy to poison young minds to lead them astray. The Kandy incidents only went on to emphasise this. No amount integrated school will be of any use in such a scenario. Interestingly, among the youth taken into custody for spreading hate speech was a student from the leading school in Colombo, which, indeed, is an integrated school having under its roof students of all races and religions.
Noble as the Minister's suggestion is, his will be an exercise in futility under the present circumstances that obtain in this country where race and religion are made use of by politicians as a short cut to power.

Towards real rectification
Political parties have already focused their attention on the Presidential election of 2020 and the next general election. Implied is their conviction that a change in the executive presidential system is not possible, at least during the term of office of the present Government. (Better not believe those now rare promises about abolishing the executive presidency).
The mass media is used to promote various candidates that aspire to be the President of the Republic and some analysts go to the extent of comparing our local heroes even with celebrated and powerful world statesmen. And speaking of heroes anyone is a hero in Sri Lanka  war heroes (Rana Viru), expatriate heroes (Rata Viru), political heroes etc.
Even the recent disturbances in Kandy are forgotten or are being forgotten in the customary Sri Lankan manner. However, the apologetic mantram that a repetition of such events will not be repeated is still heard from official quarters. It is nothing new. We have heard the same mantram being repeated ever since the latter half of the 1960s. However, no tangible action has been taken except for incomplete measures implemented under compulsion from popular struggle or external influence. That is why seventy years after winning independence we are yet to establish a Sri Lankan identity or achieve national unity and harmony. These belated and inadequate reforms were extracted from the politicos in the manner of taking a reluctant dog to the waters for a bath.
Bribery commission
Take for example the hard-won 17th Amendment to the Constitution. It was kept in limbo for several years on technical grounds, unlike the 18th Amendment which was quickly implemented. The Bribery Commission established during the Chandrika presidency was made a toothless paper tiger by denying its human and physical resources. Even the 19th Amendment was weakened by the invasion of parliamentarians to the independent commissions negating the very concept of independence. Many a statute which sounds good on paper is otherwise in reality. The latter is true of the law of the land too which has double standards- one for the wealthy and powerful and another for the poor and humble.
The arrogance of power, as well as dictatorial traits of ruling parties or personalities, has often resulted in calamitous consequences of even well-meaning projects. The modified Nilwala project resulted in enhanced periodic flooding and even the inundation of the Matara town. The accelerated Mahaweli is supposed to be a cause of subsequent frequent landslides in the hill country.
The hasty implementation of the Kotmale project has denied the population of a vast region their life-sustaining water. The consequences of the Port City project would be seen only in the future for the scientists differ on its environmental effects just like their nemesis  the soothsayers.
There is universal agreement that the Yahapalana government has faltered and lost its way early in its tenure of office. What is required today is a real rectification programme that would bring relief to the people. Incumbent governments have often resorted to quick fixes prior to elections to reduce the cost of living problems of the masses but their lifespan was short.
What is needed is a long-term solution to provide a safety net to the vulnerable low-income population. The masses are often admonished by politicians, economists and bureaucrats to tighten their belts. But those who preach do not practice what they say. It is unfair to ask the masses to sacrifice when the austerity is not practised across the board when parliamentarians and the elite engage in self-indulgence and ostentation.
In India, Ministers use Ambassador Brand cars. In certain European countries, parliamentarians including Ministers use public transport to commute. The bicycle is the mode of MPs in certain developed countries to reach Parliament. In our country, the peoples representatives, even in lower representative bodies claim to have fragile spines needing SUVs with super shock absorbers.
Whatever rosy picture ruling politicians present, our economy is in bad shape. It is perennially in a debt trap and a balance of payment crisis. Foreign investment is only a trickle and savings are far too little. Actually, the country is in such a crisis that we need to put the economy on a state similar to that of a war footing. It is necessary to strike a mean between consumer need for supporting low-income groups with the need to develop national production. Any development that does not take into consideration the plight of the poor or that does not concern the human interests is both worthless and pregnant with ultimate destruction tough ultimate anarchy.
Economic experts and politicians should guarantee a minimum standard of living with food security to all citizens. The Prime Minister has been often speaking of the need to uplift the middle class. True. But we have a much needier segment of the population below that stratum. It is necessary to reduce the tax burden on the masses by reducing indirect taxes and taxing the rich and the super-rich. Waste and corruption, as well as extravagant expenditure, should be controlled. It is time to reduce the jumbo Cabinet to one-third of its present size, reduce the perks and privileges of MPs etc. and slash the expenditure on personal security of MPs, PC members etc. Central government leaders should entrust attendance at official functions and related duties to provincial and local politicians and public servants whether they be ceremonial openings of new utility projects or functions at places of religious worship. There is room to cut down on expensive receptions, foreign trips etc.
Infrastructure development
In order to give equal benefits to the producer and the consumer, the state should intervene to eliminate the middlemen who make huge profits at both ends.
The government should intervene to reduce the cost of transportation of agricultural produce, including that of plantations. In a situation, they exceed all reasonable limits the government should start services such as those once carried out successfully by the food department and the marketing department. Priority should also be given to infrastructure development such as warehouse complexes and fruit (and vegetable) preservation centres.
There is an alarming prevalence of malnutrition, especially among the rural and estate population and unless it is addressed we will be saddled with a crippled workforce and an excessive elderly population to look after.
A holistic attitude and a pragmatic approach to planning are the sine qua non in any rectification programme to avert a slide into an abyss. Playing pandu with the lives of the populace with forthcoming elections should be replaced by real good governance based on rule of law and modern democratic norms.

Udayangas FR petition fixed for May 11
A Fundamental Rights petition filed by former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga seeking an Interim Order to recall the warrant issued for his arrest by the Colombo Fort Magistrate was yesterday fixed for support on May 11 by the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court Bench comprised Justice Vijith Malalgoda and Justice Murdu Fernando.
On October 20 last year, the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued a warrant written in English through the Interpol for the arrest of Udayanga Weeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, over alleged financial fraud to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA).
Udayanga Weeratunga had filed this petition through his mother-in-law Latha Indrani, the power of attorney holder of the petitioner.
In his petition, Udayanga Weeratunga stated that he is currently residing in Mekhanizatoriv Street Kyiv,Ukraine.
The petitioner further sought an Interim Order restraining the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank from suspending the petitioners bank accounts and continuing to suspend the bank accounts.
The petitioner stated that the seventh respondent, a Chief Inspector of the FCID had moved Magistrates Court for a warrant for the arrest of the petitioner. The petitioner sought a declaration from the Court that the Chief Inspector infringed the petitioners Fundamental Rights guaranteed in terms of Articles 11, 12(1) and 13 of the Constitution.
The petitioner further said the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank has infringed his Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the constitution by the purported decision to suspend and suspension of debit transaction of the bank accounts of the petitioner in contravention of the provisions of the Financial Transaction Reporting Act No. 6 of 2006.
In his complaint to the FCID, journalist Iqbal Athas stated that he had written several articles regarding the financial irregularities that had taken place in procuring four Mig-27 aircraft at a higher price.
He told the police that these ground attack aircraft had been manufactured between 1980 and 1983. He said financial irregularities had taken place during the transaction between Sri Lanka and Ukraine.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for the petitioner. Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda appeared for the Attorney General.

Unbeaten Lions win inaugural Royal Hockey League
Royal Lions, led by junior Sri Lankan national player Tanvir Hallaj won the inaugural IPL-style Royal Hockey League (RHL) tournament held at Royal College ground over the weekend.
The seven-a- side tournament, organized by Royal College Hockey Club (RCHC), aimed at bringing all the best hockey players at both international and national
level produced by the school. The inaugural RHL was sponsored by KBSL Information Technologies Limited.
Royal Lions, who were the only unbeaten among the six teams participated at the league stage, faced Royal Bulls led by Ashen Pieris in the cup final. Bulls part- time centre forward Manuka Pawan created a major upset when he deflected the ball to score a field goal in the third minute of the first half. Bulls dominated the game, but Tanvir equalized at the last minute of the second half ending the final with 1-1 draw.
In the three-penalty shootout series to decide the winner, Tanvir and centre half Lasitha Manchanayaka scored while Bulls failed to score any goals. The Royal Lions team was also sponsored by the tournament sponsor, while other teams were sponsored by individual old boys.
In the way to the finals, Lions beat Royal Wolves by 2-0, Royal Tigers by 1-0, while drew with Royal Rhinos (1-1), Royal Bulls (0-0), and Royal Tuskers (0-0). Royal Bulls, shockingly, lost its first game to Royal Tigers by 3-0, but came back strongly by winning two matches and drawing one league game to finish as the runners up at the league stage. Royal Tigers, which played without a goal keeper under the leadership of former Sri Lanka junior national team captain Shahid Hussain Kuthubdeen, won the plate championship by 2-1 against Royal Tuskers, while Royal Wolves which included ex-Sri Lanka national player Ashok Pieris, won the bowl championship by 2-1 against Royal Rhinos.
The tournament was a brain child of former Sri Lanka national coach Rohan Dissanayake, who has been the Royal hockey coach since 1991, bringing in many glories in the game of hockey.
Tanvir Hallaj was adjudged player of the cup final, Shahid Kuthubdeen won the player of plate final award and Ashok Pieris was awarded player of bowl final award. Shahid Kuthbdeen was adjudged the best player of the RHL while Royal Lions Shihar Aneez won the best goal keeper of the tournament award.
The winning team comprised of Tanvir Hallaj (captain), Lasitha Manchanayaka, Muditha Weerakkody, Ravi Hettiarachchi, Punsada Aravinda, Mustaq Rumy, Sandun Gajanayake, Hasanga Liyanagunawardena, Shihar Aneez, and Silmy Ahamed (KBSL, Sponsor).
The runners up Royal Bulls included Ashen Pieris (captain), Nelaka Wedagama, Pasindu Charaka, Senith Gajanayake, Praveen Buddhika, Aslam Assen, Manuka Pawan (Owner), M. Ananthevel, and Thushara Weliwatta.
The IPL-style hockey tournament for the first time in Sri Lankan history saw a large number of former Royalists turning to their alma mater to help the current school players. Team players were aged between 20-56 years.Royal Lions - Cup Winners

## Supertitle: A question of confidence in Yahapalanaya:

A question of confidence in Yahapalanaya:
Unfinished mandate
Hard on the heels of the local government elections, the Joint Opposition (JO) emboldened by the unexpectedly robust performance of their nascent political party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP), popularly known as the Pohottuwa has sought to leverage that result into destabilising the ruling coalition at the centre.
The chosen battleground has been Parliament and the modus operandi is a motion of no confidence against the Prime Minister.
Now Parliament reflects the electoral verdict of August 2015 and especially the subsequent divergent views within the former ruling UPFA, with half its group making up the JO in opposition, while half are in the governing coalition. Accordingly, in Parliament, the JO has only about fifty-five members and hence has seemingly a tough challenge to get the required numbers for a simple majority of one hundred and thirteen.
No-confidence motion
The key parliamentary blocs to watch in the numbers game would be of course the SLFP group in government, of which three members have already signed the no-confidence motion, the sixteen-member TNA group and the six-member JVP group. While some vocal members of the SLFP in Government, particularly Minister SB Dissanayake is on record stating that the SLFP has no reason to oppose the no-confidence motion, whether the entire SLFP group in government would en-bloc oppose their coalition partner is doubtful given the consequences of such a course of action.
The TNA which generally distances itself from political intrigues and palace coups in the south needs only to abstain, for the no-confidence motion to fail. The dark horse or unknown variable in the entire exercise is of course the UNP parliamentary group itself, with a few muted rumblings within its ranks, given voice from the rather unexpected quarter of Kurunegala District MP, Ranga Bandara, who claims that up to two dozen UNP MPs will desert their leader. Given that all attempts to get even one UNP MP to sign the motion was unsuccessful, this claim is likely more wishful than real. However, a parliamentary numbers game is quite often, like the glorious uncertainties of a T20 cricket match, though the outcome has much more serious consequences. However, we shall all know the result on April 4th.
Driving the current political dynamics is the politics of the 2020 election cycle, yet more than one and a half years away. While an undivided focus on the next election is obvious and understandable for an opposition, as the losers in an election, it is an unsuitable focus for a government. The Government is far better off focusing and seeking to deliver on what the people voted them into the office for, namely to implement their mandate.
In numerous conversations this columnist has had with many stakeholders, activists, supporters and sympathisers of the good governance administration and the rainbow coalition, a common thread of thought has been that the LG election results were a reflection of that fact, that the Government is seen as having not delivered sufficiently on the pledges it has made and the promises it gave in 2015. The three pillars on which this government was elected, namely economic, democratic and reconciliation reforms have all moved forward, but as the electorate so eloquently stated, progress has been quite inadequately.
The Government should consider some pragmatic measures to bring about a rebound in their popularity ratings. The real solution to the governments lacklustre polls performance would be a recommitment to its key principals and to move forward with a fresh impetus and below are some suggestions.
Rajapaksa administration
A new one hundred (100) day programme, implemented effectively including the key unfinished business, before the forthcoming provincial council elections may be in order.
Economic growth has been anaemic, with growth levels below the wartime average. With an eye on the impending election cycle and accommodating the time lag of policy measures on the real economy, the government should fairly quickly move into significant populist and welfare measures including fertilizer and other agricultural subsidies as well as state sector recruitment. The fiscal slippage can be minimized, though not eliminated through increased revenue from measures in the new Inland Revenue Act and deferment and phased out the implementation of capital projects.
The corruption and rights abuse allegations against the previous Rajapaksa Administration was a key aspect of the 2015 elections. It has certainly been a mystery to the 6.2 million Sri Lankans who voted for President Sirisena, why no progress has been made on the Thajudeen murder, the Avant-Garde case, the MIG deal, the Lasantha Wickrametunga murder among many other crimes, corruption and abuses committed during the Rajapaksa years. The robustness of the investigation of the bond issue, which to the credit of the government, has with justice issues like charity, begun at home, has not been matched by investigations and indictments on the numerous allegations against the previous regime.
Field Marshal Fonseka has been and is still making a strong claim to be given the law and order portfolio to pursue with more vigour the misdeeds of the past. While a military background is not directly police or law and order related, he is the most immune from the political calculations and external influences which can otherwise be brought to bear on the situation. In our national pastime of cricket, when a bowler is not taking wickets, the captain makes a bowling change. Similarly, during the past three years, regarding corruption and abuse of power, except for the former presidential secretary convicted on the misuse of TRC funds, no other convictions were secured and few indictments made. Minister Sagala Ratnayaka took the gentlemans high road and stepped aside. It is perhaps time to give the war-winning army commander, a new challenge to launch a two-year war on corruption, past and present.
Playing the same notes on a musical instrument, only produces the same old music as in the past. It is time for something different to achieve the unfished tasks of the good governance promises of 2015.

UNP working committee throws weight behind PM
UNP Parliamentarians were upbeat about defeating the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against the Prime Minister following a two hour Working Committee meeting yesterday.
The Working Committee meeting was chaired by Prime Minister and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Sirikotha UNP Head Office to discuss the NCM and the way forward for the party.
The UNP will defeat the NCM and immediately undertake major party reforms of leadership structure, National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said.
Party sources said the Working Committee has decided to consecutively sit from April 5-7 to finalise party reforms and implement them within two months.
It was unanimously agreed to vote en bloc to defeat the NCM against the Prime Minister and the Government brought by the Joint Opposition. It is expected that all UNP MPs, except perhaps one or two who are not with the party, will vote against the NCM, Dr. de Silva said in a note on his official Facebook account.
A resolution to back the PM during the NCM on April 4 was passed unanimously at the meeting.
Party sources confirmed that State Minister Palitha Range Bandara, who initially suggested the idea of bringing a No-Confidence Motion against PM Wickremesinghe, has also agreed to vote against the motion.
If any MP goes against the unanimous decision of the Party, he will face stern action, UNP sources explained.
Dr. de Silva further said in his note that PM Wickremesinghe at the meeting undertook to implement the recommendations given in the reports of the three committees appointed in the aftermath of the Local Government Elections. The three committees were chaired by Minister Sajith Premadasa, State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene and MP J.C. Aluwathuwala.
The first committee has come up with 38 recommendations on matters related to policies and the second committee has come up with 27 recommendations on party reforms. The Third committee has looked into the issues faced by backbenchers and party organisers.
The recommendations will be implemented with amendments if necessary to ensure UNP is reinvigorated to become a strong party that can win elections he added.
State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe had proposed at the meeting that the UNP should not support a common candidate at the next Presidential election.
The working committee had also discussed about the recommendations of the Committee headed by Tilak Marapana, which was appointed to examine the report submitted by the Commission of Inquiry into the Treasury Bonds issue. UNP sources close to MP Ravi Karunanayake said the working committee was of the view that there was no basis for the recommendation of Marapana Committee that MP Karunanayake has to be removed from the post of Assistant Leader of UNP.
It was pointed out at the meeting that the Attorney General has not yet taken any legal action against the MP. MP Karunanayake has also informed the committee that he would not quit his position, sources added.
At the meeting UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe had asked his Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa to think beyond provincial level politics and take up national level issues.
Be ready to go around the country and solve peoples problems without being restricted to Hambantota he had told Premadasa.
Many members discussed the pros and cons with several voicing their opinions on the need to ensure the party reforms are done as soon as possible and they must be significant; unlike the Cabinet reshuffle. It was argued that we must listen carefully to what our party cadres across the country as well as what the general public sympathetic to the UNP are saying out loud. It was also agreed to take on board the proposals made by our allies making up the UNF upon discussions with them, Dr.de Silva commented.
All agreed to start discussions on party and policy reforms on April 5 soon after we defeat the NCM on April 4 and conclude the discussions hopefully by the close of business on April 8. The term of office of all office bearers were only extended until April 30. A hard deadline has been set, he summed up.

U.S. economy grew close to Trumps 3% goal
The U.S. economy grew at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the final three months of 2017, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That's slightly faster than the previous 2.5 percent growth estimate, but slower than the 3.2 percent pace of the third quarter.
Overall, the economy grew 2.3 percent last year, compared with 1.5 percent in 2016. That's well below the 3 percent or higher that the Trump administration is targeting.
The solid fourth quarter was fueled by strong consumer spending, which grew 4 percent  its fastest pace in three years. Gross domestic product growth would have been even faster if consumers hadn't spent so much on imports, which subtract from domestic growth.
Economists say growth is expected to slow in the current quarter but speed up later this year, boosted by tax cuts and higher government spending.
Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months. He cited the stimulus offered by the big tax-cutting bill and said "ongoing job gains are boosting incomes and confidence," while global economic growth "is on a firm trajectory."
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was revised up to a 4.0 percent rate in the fourth quarter from the 3.8 percent pace reported last month. That was the quickest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014 and followed a 2.2 percent rate of growth in the July-September period.
Imports grew at an upwardly revised 14.1 percent pace instead of the previously reported 14.0 percent rate. That was the quickest pace since the third quarter of 2010 and overshadowed a rise in exports driven by weakness in the dollar. (CNBC)

Victory  over death
It is finished; and he bowed his head and handed over his spirit.
Those of you who sat in theaters or rented the movie and watched from home `The Passion of the Christ surely would have been horrified by the beatings, the blood and the hanging on the cross, but the Mel Gibson film was still a softer version of the actual torture and torment that Jesus endured on Good Friday.
According to research the weapons used in the beatings, the number of lashes on the body of Jesus, and other methods of torture used by his assailants, the face of Jesus would have been unrecognizable and by the time Jesus was nailed to the cross his wounds revealed bone.
Few would have survived the original beatings but Jesus was set on doing the will of his heavenly Father. There was nothing, and no one, who could have stopped him from becoming the sinless sacrifice, and performing the greatest act of love on behalf of the entire human race.
Its difficult to visualize Christ, the Son of God, the Lord and Saviour of the world, bleeding profusely and being mocked by the crowd as he walked toward Calvary on Good Friday. Jesus took on the sins of thieves, of molesters and schemers, every sin of every man, woman and child on earth which was a load no mortal man could ever carry.
This yearly celebration of the passion, death and resurrection of Christ has been kept in the church since earliest times. Originally the celebration lasted only three days, which now correspond to Good Friday, Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday. Soon it was extended to a whole week which we call Holy week. Later the church established a time of preparation for Easter, the time we call Lent. The time of Lent was intended to be a period of preparation for baptism and for Easter celebration while for those who are already baptized had to repent for the sins. Praying more assiduously, doing penance and helping our neighbours in need, have been considered the best ways of sharing in the passion and death of Jesus Christ. For a long time abstinence was considered the best way of doing penance but as the circumstances in the world changed, the Church does not impose it any longer as a command except on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday.
On Good Friday, the entire Church fixes her gaze on the Cross at Calvary as we try to understand how Christ has won our redemption. In the solemn ceremonies of Good Friday, in the Adoration of the Cross, in the reading of the Passion, and in receiving the pre-consecrated Host, we unite ourselves to our Saviour.
The Church will strip of its ornaments, the altar bare, and with the door of the empty tabernacle standing open. No Mass is celebrated on this day, but the service of Good Friday is called the Mass of the pre-sanctified because Communion which had already been consecrated on Holy Thursday is given to the people. Traditionally, the organ is silent from Holy Thursday until the Alleluia at the Easter Vigil, as are all bells or other instruments, the only music during this period being unaccompanied chant. The desolate quality of the rites of this day reminds us of Christs humiliation and suffering during his Passion.
However the bleakness of Good Friday does not remain as Christians move on to the resurrection of Jesus. After travelling with the Christ through this Lent and His passion and death, we arrive at new life. Death is not an ending but is a new beginning. Because of Christs victory over death, the grave is not final. We naturally will feel sorrow and grief when those we love die and we are separated from them in this life. But the believer will know one day all will be taken from their graves to be clothed with glorified resurrected bodies.
The resurrection is celebrated on the most famous vigil in the year Easter called the Paschal Vigil. Christians took the name and even the date of this feast from `Passover feast of the Jews. For Christians it has a deeper meaning than it does for Jews. For Jews the passing over meant passing along of the angel of Yahweh in Egypt, who by passing the houses of Israelites killed the first born of the Egyptian families thus setting free the people of Israel from the slavery of Pharaoh.
For Christians it is about passing from Christs death to life through His resurrection. It is the passing of each Christian from the death of sin to a new life in Christ. For many years Easter was the only feast for the early Christians. Easter continues to be the centre of the year of worship, just as the resurrection of Jesus will always be the pillar on which the Christian faith rests.
As birds chirp, flowers start to pop up from the ground and trees get green, the world comes alive again after a long and cold winter and this is the perfect time to celebrate the new life we received through Christ.

Warner apologises for my part in tampering scandal
SYDNEY, Thursday: Former Australia vice captain David Warner broke his silence over the ball-tampering saga on Thursday with a post on social media in which he apologised and accepted responsibility for his part in the scandal.
The opening batsman was suspended from international and state cricket for 12 months on Wednesday and banned from ever holding a leadership position in the test team again for his role in the cheating in Cape Town.
I am currently on my way back to Sydney, Warner posted in a message to cricket fans in Australia and all over the world on Instagram.
Mistakes have been made which have damaged cricket. I apologise for my part and take responsibility for it. I understand the distress this has caused the sport and its fans.
Its a stain on the game we all love and I have loved since I was a boy.
Warner was identified as the instigator of the tampering in the findings of the Cricket Australia investigation, instructing junior batsman Cameron Bancroft how to scuff up one half of the ball with sandpaper during the third test against South Africa.
Bancroft was banned for nine months for his part, while captain Steve Smith also received a one-year ban, even though he was described in the report of only being aware of the plan. As well as the ignominy of being identified as the main villain of the piece in the Cricket Australia report, Warner has paid a heavy financial penalty for his misjudgement.
A subsequent ban from the Indian Premier League (IPL) cost him $1.85 million this season, while sports manufacturer ASICS and technology giant LG have both said they would no longer work with him. Warner is expected to land in his home city in the late evening local time on a separate flight from Smith but confirmed that he would not be taking the opportunity to address media.
I need to take a deep breath and spend time with my family, friends and trusted advisors, he added. You will hear from me in a few days.

Whats Good about  Good Friday..!
Many a time, Im asked by friends as I walk with them or talk to them, Bob, whats so good about Good Friday And they continue, Sure its good those years in school having a holiday, but wasnt it the day Jesus died on the cross And you Christians call that good
Whats so good about Good Friday
If you look at what happened, it was one of the most horrible days in the Christian calendar, as an innocent man, who claimed to be the Messiah, was not just hung on the cross, but nailed on to it. Huge, big nails were hammered through his hands and feet, and a Roman soldier even drove a spear through his side.
Just before the ordeal on the cross, Christ had been made to walk through the streets of Jerusalem, beaten, bruised and battered, but carrying the heavy wooden cross, on which he would finally be nailed!
Just before that, he had been whipped and flogged. He had been mocked by the Romans, the Jewish priests and even the crowds, many of whom he had healed, and by many whod seen his miracles and had heard him preach.
They all knew he was innocent.
Yet they watched him die.
And we call the day, Good
I can understand the confusion in the minds of my friends. Whats wrong with you guys, calling such a terrible day good Are you sadists
No, we arent, I reply. Jesus died as part of Gods plan. Throughout the holy scriptures we hear about God wanting to walk with man, talk with man, but separated from men and women because both were wicked. How then could God the creator of man, walk and talk with his creation
Only by someone taking the punishment for us being wicked.
And on that Good Friday, two thousand years ago, on a rough wooden cross, Jesus died for the sins of the world, and with His death, everybody, not just Christians, but everybody had access to God walking, talking and being their Father and friend.
I hear noises. I feel transported to that gory, horrible scene on a hill in Jerusalem. I see His severely wounded body, his bloodied face, and his head rammed tight with a crown of thorns.
I hear the mocking soldiers, and see the jeering crowd, and then I see his eyes searching, through that crowd, till they rest on me, Bob, he says in a whisper, only I can hear, I die for you, so that you can walk with my father!
And suddenly I feel a sense of freedom, for indeed, now with God beside me, alongside me, inside me, it is a good Friday indeed..!

Claiming diplomatic immunity:
Wickramasuriyas writ petition dismissed
The Court of Appeal yesterday dismissed a writ petition filed by former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Jaliya Wickramasuriya who challenged the Foreign Affairs Ministrys decision to waive his diplomatic immunity.
While upholding the preliminary objections raised by the Attorney General against the writ petition, Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne decided to dismiss the petition in limine.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda appearing for the Attorney General had informed the Court of Appeal that the petition cannot be maintained since the Court of Appeal does not have a jurisdiction to hear the application.
ASG Kodagoda contended that the powers relating to the diplomatic affairs are vested with the President and thereby this application should have been heard before the Supreme Court.
Filing a writ petition in the Court of Appeal, Jaliya Wickramasuriya alleged that the Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had issued a letter informing US authorities that the diplomatic immunity of former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the US Jaliya Wickramasuriya had been removed.
The petitioner is seeking a writ order to quash the Ministry Secretarys decision to issue a letter waiving his diplomatic immunity contrary to the laws, regulations and conventions.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appeared on behalf of the petitioner.
On a previous occasion, the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued an open warrant for the arrest of Jaliya Wickramasuriya for his failure to appear before Court.
The FCID had filed a B report in the Fort Magistrates Court against Jaliya Wickramasuriya for allegedly misappropriating USD 330,000 out of USD 6.6 million allocated for purchasing a building for the Sri Lankan Embassy in the US.
The FCID alleged that the suspect had misappropriated the concerned amount committed during the purchase of a building to house the Sri Lankan Embassy at 3025, White Haven Street, Washington. The former ambassador had remitted this money to Sri Lanka. The former Ambassador is a close relative of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Worlds cheesiest pizza
A Berlin restaurant has recently created a record of making the world's 'cheesiest pizza', topped with at least 111 different types of cheese.
The pizza, crafted by an American pizza chef at the Berlin restaurant named Vadoli Pizzeria is topped with 288.6 grams of cheese. The Guinness World Records recognised the feat and was adjourned the "greatest variety of cheese on a pizza."
According to Food and Wine, the chef used 111 different types of cheese on the pizza, which he didnot even expand to hold that vast collection of melted dairy, but rather kept the size of a regular pie. Given the small size of the pizza, the American chef carefully measured out the same amount of each cheese to include on the pizza (exactly 2.6 grams). According to the Guinness World Records, he included "mozzarella, Emmental, Leicestershire red, Comt and Raclette de Chvre," among other varieties, on the pizza. The cheese-packed pizza was then served at an event later, where one guest, who tasted the pizza said that "each piece tastes different."
Last month, a town in Michigan in the US claimed to have made the world's largest delivery pizza, while Los Angeles broke the record of baking a 7,000 long pizza in Los Angeles last year. The Economic Times

World Water Day  Nature for Water
Nine companies showcase nature-based solutions to address water quality issues at a Trade Fair on Advanced and Appropriate Water Treatment Systems in Colombo.
Globally, 2.1 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services. Furthermore, over 80 percent of the wastewater generated by society flows back into the environment without being treated or reused.
This years theme for World Water Day is Nature for Water, with a focus on finding nature-based solutions to the water challenges we face.
The UNDP supported Climate Resilient Integrated Water Management Project (CRIWMP) is one such example of using nature based solutions to improve irrigation of water tanks in the Northern, Eastern, North Western and North Central Provinces by investing in improving the community irrigation water infrastructure, scaling-up decentralized drinking water systems, and strengthening early weather warnings, flood-response, and water management. This seven-year project (2017-2024) is aimed at strengthening the resilience of Smallholder Farmers in Sri Lankas Dry Zone to climate variability and extreme events.
To support water purification under this programme, a Trade Fair on Advanced and Appropriate Water Treatment Systems to treat water in locations with serious water quality issues was held at the Red Verandah, BMICH in commemoration of World Water Day 2018, where nine companies showcased nature-based solutions, in parallel with alternative approaches, in water treatment technologies and practices.
This was initiated by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) supported Climate Resilient Integrated Water Management Project (CRIWMP) together with the World Bank assisted Water Supply and Sanitation Improvement Project.
The above two Projects aim to improve access to potable water by enhancing community-managed rural water supply infrastructure including advanced filtration and treatment systems with appropriate disinfection processes.
Speaking about UNDPs support, Lovita Ramguttee, Deputy Country Director, UNDP Sri Lanka stated, Nature-based solutions have the potential to solve many of our water challenges. UNDP remains committed to exploring these solutions together with our partners, to support smallholder farmers in the Dryzone of Sri Lanka to ensure we can protect and manage our water resources in a sustainable manner.
The Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, the Ministry of City Planning and Water Supply, National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Department of National Community Water Supply, Presidential Task Force on Prevention of CKDu Ministry of Science and Technology, University representatives, private sector contractors are a few of the stakeholders who participated at this trade fair.
Speaking about this, Eng. D. U. Sumanasekara, General Manager of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board stated, "The rural communities in Sri Lanka need potable water for which new and advanced treatment technologies have to be showcased and promoted. I appreciate the combined effort of these two projects to promote these nature-based technologies to improve the quality of life of the rural people."
With the advancement of Nano technology and other innovative water treatment technologies; many new water treatment options have been developed both locally and internationally. This trade fair explored the best solutions to address drinking water concerns at a community level in the Dryzone of Sri Lanka.

Younpura youth camp held in Nikaweratiya
Although the government received a warning signal from youth at the recently concluded local council elections, its sole objective is to chart a better future for the entirety of the youth generation, rather than to create a better tomorrow only for children of a ruling dynasty Project management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said.
Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said this participating in the inaugural ceremony of the Younpura youth camp held at Nikaweratiya as the Chief Guest on March 28.
Minister Ratnayake said, when the results of the local elections were taken into consideration, what the country's youth had requested was for the government to accelerate its programmes to ensure a better future for them. As such, the era had dawned when the government should pay more attention towards country's youth. Ratnayake said, a country's economic development meant the sound foundation laid to develop the country. We should therefore begin to build youth attitudes and opportunities needed to overcome the challenging needs occurring with the development of the country. Unless that was done, we wont be able to overcome future challenges Minister Ratnayake said.
Minister Ratnayake said, their sole endeavour was to empower youth politically, socially and culturally. They have paid special attention towards laying the foundation to enable youth to ensure their future security without differences as to race, religion, caste or political orientation. Their endeavour was to create a better tomorrow (Hetak) for all youth without restricting it to the princes of a royal family. That responsibility had been cast on his shoulders in his capacity as Youth Affairs Minister. As such, they were all committed to create a youth generation which realised its dreams without perpetually living in a world of dreams.
