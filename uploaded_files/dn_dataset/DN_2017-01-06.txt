NCE achieves significant successes in 2016
The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE), the leading Chamber which serves Sri Lankan exporters of products and services and service providers to exporters has acieved significant success in 2016.
The Chamber has nearly 500 Member Enterprises including some of the big export houses in Sri Lanka and a large number of SME type export oriented ventures.
Background to performance of Sri Lankan exporters in 2016 
Sri Lankan exporters who make a vital contribution to the economic development in Sri Lanka are known for their resilience, and have performed under adverse conditions in the local and external environment, particularly during the period of terrorism which lasted nearly three decades.
Export performance, and growth, particularly during the last decade has been poor in comparison to competitor countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam, although they faced the same challenges in the external environment.
Some of the main constraints faced by Sri Lankan exporters vis a vis their competitors are the relatively high finance and energy costs, in-adequate infrastructure facilities, high rates of inflation, shortage of skilled labour in important sectors of production, macroeconomic, (fiscal and taxation)policy instability, lack of adequate production capacity in most sectors, and the relatively low level of demand from buyers due to high cost of production among others.
In this background the withdrawal of the GSP Plus facility, and the ban on the export of fisheries products by the European Union exacerbated their problems since the EU is the largest export market for Sri Lanka.
Policy issues
The Chamber has consistently brought to the notice of the relevant State Authorities the adverse effects of adhoc policy changes in the confidence of entrepreneurs and investors to engage in business. The imbalance of direct and indirect taxation is a case in point. State intervention in private sector wages due to the lack of a clear wage policy is another example. However, the efforts of the Chamber, have borne fruit in that the Unity Government has embarked on several measures to streamline and stabilize policies related to both Trade and Investment.
Formulation of a National Trade Policy, and negotiation of Economic Partnership and Free Trade Agreements.
The Chamber has effectively contributed to the initiative of the Government to formulate a National Trade Policy by organizing Forums with the relevant Stakeholders an dits members to discuss concerned issues, and have made proposals to the Government. Similarly the Chamber has extensively engaged with the Ministry of Strategy development and International Trade and Other State Agencies covering the activities of the proposed Economic and Technology CooperationAgreement (ECTA) with India and theFree Trade Agreements with China and Singapore. While agreeing in principle on the overall benefitsof such Agreements to the National Economyin a competitive Trading Environment, the Chamber has submitted several proposals to overcome the deficiencies in the current FTA with India, and the current regulatory environment, to safeguard Sri Lankan Enterprises, before implementing the proposed FTAs.
Measures to improve the quality of services of the Chamber 

* In 2016, the Chamber developed its Management Systems including documentation, and was successful in obtaining ISO 9001 Certification. Systems development and training of staff was carried outwith the assistance of Indexpo CertificationLtd. which is a UNIDO initiated National Certification Body.
* In 2016 the Chamber also embarked on the preparation of a Strategic Plan for the next five years with a new Vision, Mission, and Objectives to align itself more effectively with National objectives for Economic Development, particularly in relation to exports. The task was carried out with professional inputs from the multinational Audit Firm Ernst & Young. The work programs of the Chamber in 2017 will conform to this strategic plan.
*Further during 2016 the Chamber revamped its flagship publication the quarterly Sri Lanka Exporter Magazine. This high quality magazine which is the only of its kind in the field of exports, carries valuable articles and information of value to Sri Lankan exporters of Products and Services as well as Service Providers to Exporters.
It serves to promote Sri Lankan Products and Services in overseas markets by attracting buyers, since it is distributed to all important Trade points both locally and overseas. The material in the magazine is subscribed by a professional writers and experts inspecialized areas related to exports. Measures were adopted to increase the quantum of original articles,and include success stories of Sri Lankan exporters,particularly of member exporters to highlight their achievements andunique offers to the International Market Place. The print quality of the magazine was also substantially improved.
Skills development 
* The dearth of skills in important sectors related to exports is one of the constraints that has been discussed by the Council of the Chamber. This involves Management skills, and specially technical skills, as well as knowledge in operational aspects of exports in respect of employees in export enterprises. To contribute to overcome this constraint the Chamber on its part has conducted a number of training seminars and workshops on export related subjects of importance. Among those conducted during 2016, is a Training Seminar on the implementation of the Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS) both in English and Sinhala mediums specially for the benefit of SME Entrepreneurs, a Training Program on the new Food Safety Modernisation Act of the USA for export related enterprises, an Awareness Program on the opportunities to supply Branded products to China, an Educational Forum to minimize costs and maximise benefits from Free Trade Agreements, the importance and procedures related to Quarantine Issues for Import and Export of Plants and Animals, Kosher Certification for Food and Beverage Export Industries, and a Forum to Disseminate knowledge on the Implications of the Budget Proposals for 2017 including how best to use the fiscal and taxation proposals.
* To improve Management and operational skills of those employed in export ventures, and for their career advancement, as well as for school leavers who wish to engage in exports as a profession, the Chamber conducts three professional courses in Export Import Trade Management at Certificate Level and Diploma Level, through its subsidiary the National Institute of Exports (NIOE), which is a non-profit service organization.
These courses have received the recognition of the National Vocational and Education Commission (NVEC). In 2017 the Chamber will enter into an MOU with the ITC SME Trade Academy to extend these services online through e-learning modules.
* The Chamber has also made budgetary proposals in 2016 to promote skills developmentsome aspects of which have been accepted to provide incentives and assistance to the Private sector.
Outreach programs 
* In 2016 the NCE successfully implemented a program to link producers in the North with Member Exporters in the South covering the fruits and vegetable sector, fisheries sector, and related services such as Boat Building. This program has been implemented under a collaborative arrangement with the International Labour Organization (ILO) with funding from the Australian Government.
During the year the Chamber has been able to organise several delegations of Member exporters to visit the North to explore opportunities, and link with producers to obtain their products for export. Several contractual agreements have been signed to harness the produce for export, resulting in the economic advancement of producers in the North. The products and services have also been exhibited at the Annual Jaffna International Trade fair.
This program has also enabled to complement the efforts of the Government for reconciliation between the peoples of the North and South following the Civil conflict and is known for its credibility.
* As an extension to this program, in 2017, the Chamber under its new Strategic Plan proposes to establish strong linkages with Regional Chambers of Commerce and Industry to provide extended services, especially to SMEs, to develop and promote them to link to the Export Value Chain, thereby contributing to the National effort to increase the number of exporters, and service providers to exporters, to achieve the ambitious overall export target set for 2020.
In this context it will also support the objective of the Government to increase the number of registered exporters by 1000, through a programme of the Export Development Board.
Participation at important Forums of the State
In 2016 the Chamber contributed as an active partner to the World Export Development Forum (WEDF) conducted for the first time in Sri Lanka by the Export Development Board in collaboration with the ITC in Geneva. This landmark event which was attended by several International delegations from overseas markets served to boost the image of Sri Lanka in the International stage as an important Trading and Investment destination.
The Chamber servedin the Steering Committeeto organise the event, and also to conduct the connected Trade Exhibition to showcase Sri Lankan Export Products and Services to overseas visitors.
The Chamber has also been an active participant of the Ease of Doing Business Forum conducted by the Ministry of Finance, and the Exporters Forum conducted by the Export Development Board, to represent policy and operational issues of member exporters for their resolution.
Budget Proposals for 2017 
The NCE submitted several proposals for the Budget presented in November 2016.The main proposals included the importance of Branding Sri Lanka in the International Market Place, the need to rationalise activities which come under the purview of several Ministries related to exports to facilitate trade and investment, deficiencies that need to be corrected related to current bilateral Trade Agreements before proceeding with new ones, the need to provide innovative financial support for Capital Investment and Working Capital funding of export enterprises including the vital need to establish an Export Import (EXIM) Bank, solutions to overcome constraints for the development and expansion of the Spice Industry specially Ceylon Cinnamon in which Sri Lanka has monopoly, tax relief to companies to encourage listing in the Colombo Stock exchange, need to be flexible in granting triple tax deduction for R & D, and proposals for skills development including the establishment of a Skills Development Fund to support in house activities of export enterprises.
Annual Export Awards 
The Annual Export Awards ceremony of the Chamber to recognize and reward excellence in exports of Sri Lankan Products and Services is the most looked forward to business event in Sri Lanka, attended by over 750 participants including the political leadership, Members of the Diplomatic corps, High State officials, and the cream of the business community.
In addition to the main Awards that are given away to exporters of Products and Services,in 2016 the Chamber introduced a set of Special Awards to recognise the efforts of other contributory Stakeholders in the field of exports. These included Banks, Universities, and Women Entrepreneurs. The Chamber also introduced a newly designed Trophy incorporating modern concepts related to business.
In 2017 the Chamber will introduce a restructured simplified application incorporating current needs, and also Provincial Awards to recognize and encourage the efforts of SMEs in the value chain of exports, through an outreach programme.

Singer donates water purification plant,  distribution system to Ulukkulama village
Singer Sri Lanka PLC, the countrys leading brand of household and electrical appliances in its latest contribution towards the eradication of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), donated a water purification plant to the rural village of Ulukkulama in the Anuradhapura District.
The project was funded by Singer Sri Lanka at a cost of Rs. 4 million and was jointly presented through technological expertise from Puritas of Hayleys Group and under the guidance of Water Board.
Singer had selected the CKD affected village of Ulukkulama located in the district of Anuradhapura in collaboration with Puritas Pvt Ltd of Hayleys Group and has seen through the setup of a water purification plant or Reverse Osmosis plants as they are technically known in the hope of providing village residents of over 1600 inhabitants in Ulukkulama with quality portable water.
Singer Sri Lanka PLC Group CEO, Asoka Pieris was present at the unveiling of the plant at Ulukkulama. Commenting on the occasion he said, We have recognised the issue of CKD that has affected a part of our nation. We believe that this new reverse osmosis plant will help provide the people of this community with clean portable water and help those affected by this disease to recover from this adverse condition. We hope this project will enlighten other organisations to follow and continue to bring this facility to better the lives of people affected by CKD.
The newly constructed water purification plant and the distribution system consists of nine (09) distribution points placed in selected locations in the village to serve residents to collect purified water conveniently. The purification plant can produce 10,000 litres of water per day and one liter is sold at just Rs. 1 /= to a resident. All the proceeds will be contributed towards maintenance of the plant and for any other developments required for the future.
After extensive analysis, tests had helped shape the fact that about 15% of those affected from CKD could gradually recover if their water drinking habits change. As there has been a dire need for clean, fresh water in villages from these affected areas, Singer had come forth with the hope of providing a helping hand in order to further assist in swiftly eradicating CKD in Sri Lanka.
In mid 2016 Singer donated three CRRT (Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy) machines to the National Hospital worth over Rs. 7.5 million under Singer Thirst for Life health and wellness sustainability project, making the total number of machines donated to six units, in helping those affected by CKD.

## Title: Reckoning with Reconciliation

Reckoning with Reconciliation
The Consultations Task Force (CTF) on Reconciliation Mechanisms final report which was released this week drew controversy for suggesting the need for international persons in a special court along with a special counsel to hear cases of war crimes. Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives and member of the CTF, Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu in an interview with Daily News explained that international persons were only recommended to assure credibility in a judicial mechanism and that they could be phased out once local capacity is built.
Excerpts follow:
Q: Your report had expressed frustration among the people and yet another task force was interviewing them. At the same time, Minister Rajitha Senaratne said the government would not appoint foreign judges and while the committees can submit reports, the government makes the decision at the end of the day. Then do you think that the people were right in being weary
A. At the very beginning people did come and express their frustration but then they were pleased, that this was the first time that a government was asking them for an opinion about a particular policy before a policy decision was made. At least thats what they thought and so did we.
Secondly, the Task Force did set out to find out what people thought. If there were pre-determined decisions taken, with respect to the special courts or anything else, the people were told that they had to make up their minds within that framework and provide whatever recommendations they had.
What we wanted, before the consultations took place was for the government to do an outreach programme and explain to the people as to why transitional justice was necessary, why they were proposing these four mechanisms and what the dos and donts were with regard to its structures.
The report was compiled on the basis of what people said to us. It is up to the government to take from it or not, and hopefully explain to the people why it is taking recommendation A as opposed to B.
Finally, in October last year there was a resolution co-sponsored by Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council that allowed for international participation in these mechanisms.
Q: Do you think that if these outreach programmes had been done by the government, the people would have been more open
A. One thing we can presume is that they would have been better informed as to what the government intended and what the government was thinking with regard to all this.
Q: But we have repeatedly heard the President and Prime Minister insist that reconciliation is a priority of the government and that we need to have it
A. One thing everyone could agree on is that reconciliation must happen. What is important, is what one means by it and what is one going to do Some may think that setting up a commission was what reconciliation is all about while others may think of something else.
The difference in opinion lies in what you mean by reconciliation and what institutions and processes you want to establish to achieve it.
Everyone in Sri Lanka has a notion of reconciliation but they were being asked to comment on mechanisms, the government of Sri Lanka was proposing.
Q: One of the recommendations was the need to have international judges and a special counsel for a special court system. While many may have wished for this, this seems to be the one which would attract most opposition
A. It needs to be explained properly. The whole purpose of any court is to administer justice. Thus there needs to be faith, confidence and trust in that institution to be able to do so. Unfortunately the situation in this country is such that there are a substantial number of people and a fair number of them are victims, who do not trust the existing system. And most of them happened to be in the North and East, who turn around and say that if its completely domestic, it will not be credible. Then you have cases like the murder of Raviraj where people say I told you so. So thats a strong body of opinion that needs to be taken into account. Theres another body of opinion which says, this is a sovereign country and that bringing in internationals is not right.
The issue here is, would bringing in internationals really be an encroachment of our sovereignty
We are recommending for example some internationals on these benches; at least one in order to build credibility and to deal with the suspicion that things would be biased if it is entirely domestic. And then the international can come out and say if things are not being followed according to due process.
Also if there is evidence for prosecution of such crimes, these have never been prosecuted in Sri Lanka before so you need that international expertise. We are also saying that this does not have to be a permanent feature. Once the technical and capacity questions have been addressed and local expertise is built up, then internationals can be phased out. It has happened in other countries.
I dont see what the fuss is about, people are simply trying to make a lot of political capital out of this. End of the day, we have to ask ourselves whats this special court all about and what is this accountability mechanism all about and look at the most efficient way we can get the justice we wanted.
We are not saying that all members of the security forces have to be put in the dock because they are guilty of war crimes. Thats nonsense. There will be certain instances of it and you cannot bring these things into court unless you have hard evidence. So this is not some sort of witch hunt.
If people do have hard evidence of such cases, even the security forces would have a hard look and say we too need to salvage our honour and have a proper mechanism to investigate it.
Q: The Security forces too have made submissions and insisted that no such crimes had ever taken place
A. Their argument was that we surely support reconciliation but as far as we are concerned, we never practiced any war crimes, if there was, it should be investigated and brought to justice. They were very reasonable. But yes, they do start from the position that no crimes against humanity happened.
Q: There are allegations that the report is pro-UN or pro-West
A. They would say that anyway. There are people in this country who were in power and the like who would shout western conspiracy imperialism or traitor- it is tiresome. We need to move forward and we are unable to do that with such shrieks.
We had over 7,000 submissions and those who have doubts can read their accounts and ask the people.
Q: The Hybrid Court model was recommended earlier too and not responded to positively by the government
A. Taken well by the government or not when the people make such a submission made to us, do we turn around and tell the people look the government may not like it No, we are duty bound to convey what they think.
Q: Do you think that the Consultation Task force is yet another box to be ticked off
A. It just as well could be. It is up to civil society to tell the government and ask whether they are serious about transitional justice or not.
Q: The report also shows a divide in terms of what the people in the North and South want. The North seems to be seeking for the need to have the truth established and investigated while the South is more insistent on moving on and burying the past. How would a government reconcile the two demands
A. You have to ask the government. There are different opinions across the country in respect to certain aspects of reconciliation. It is not correct that the North said this and that the South said this. There are commonalities and differences between the two. The government then has to go out again and find out what is common among them, what their core understandings and values are before they set up any of these mechanisms. What we can report is a variety of views across the country.
But in the North and East you have more people who would turn around and talk about international participation. In the South there will be more people who say there should not be any international participation.
But at the same time, in the South too you had people saying yes there should be international participation. Its not clear cut.
Q: What did you find about reconciliation
A. People across the country are very convinced of the importance of reconciliation moving forward. They have suggestions to make with regard to the four conventional pillars from accountability, reparations, guarantees of non-recurrence and truth.
They want the truth established and acknowledged, those who gave orders to be held accountable, they want to be part of any reconciliation mechanism set up, they want them located in places they have access to and for it to operate in languages they understand.
They see these factors important and want action. They are tired of commission after commission.
Q: Many of what is recommended is not new. Hasn't it all been said before
A. Yes, most of what has been said, has been repeated, theres nothing earth shattering. But what is interesting is that the peoples views and opinions are different to what the politicians make it out to be.
There is remarkable coincidence between what people in the North and South say.
There is no sharp divide between the two; to the great annoyance of nationalists from both sides.

Huawei aims to be number one  smartphone brand in 2017 in SL
Singer Sri Lanka PLC and Huawei recently celebrated a successful partnership of over four years together.
Huawei joined hands with Singer Sri Lanka in 2012 and through Singers marketing and distribution strategies, Huawei has gradually built up a sound market position in the Sri Lankan smartphone and tablet users today.
In recognition of having realized a myriad of achievements in a very short period of time, Huawei and Singer announced their success at a press brief which was conducted at the Singer Head office in Navam Mawatha amongst a distinguished gathering of Singer Sri Lanka and Huawei Sri Lanka management including Singer Sri Lanka PLC Group CEO, Asoka Pieris and Huawei Device Sri Lanka Country Head Henry Liu.
Huawei chose to associate their brand with Singer Sri Lanka due to its brand reputation that was evident amongst the Sri Lankan public. Having started from zero base in 2012, Singer had successfully assisted in propelling Huaweis brand image and market share to over 30% by the third quarter of 2016, according to latest analysis from user experience research experts GfK.
In terms of technology, Huawei had no doubt adapted itself and its brand name within a more localized outlook to suit the prospective Sri Lankan smartphone user. Coupled with the Singer brands know-how, customer base, islandwide reach and backing from dealers, Huawei has in a very short period of time, made a name for itself working alongside Singer, said Singer Sri Lanka PLC Group CEO, Asoka Pieris.
Pieris also disclosed that smartphones valuing Rs. 6.5 billion has been sold to date through Singer dealerships. In Sri Lanka, Huawei has shown an increase in sales mainly in the Western region but almost the entire country has shown an equal pattern of growth in Huawei branded smartphone sales.
Commenting on Huaweis growth for the past four years, Huawei Device Sri Lanka Country Head Henry Liu remarked, Huawei has a reputation for aligning a dedicated and stringent approach towards offering customers technological breakthroughs and we are committed to offer the best of tech related options to the smartphone user. Encompassing unique features such as dual cameras and finger-print access, Huawei always works to step up the game and achieve ambitious targets when it comes to achieving sales growth. I am confident to say that Huawei together with Singer will target to be number one in Sri Lanka in 2017.
We appreciate Singer Sri Lankas contributions for having brought Huawei to this level and as our focus is only to bring the best to Sri Lanka, Huawei looks forward to even more amazing additions to the product portfolio in terms of 4G fast downloads, smartphones covering all ranges of budgets as well as a tablet to the Sri Lankan market, Liu acknowledged.

Govt to ink Htota port lease deal by late January
The government will go ahead with the proposed Hambantota Port lease deal with China Merchants Port Holdings (CMPH) by late January, said Minister of International Trade Malik Samarawickrama at a special press conference held yesterday in Colombo.
The minister said that the lease would be for USD1.1 billion and it would be for a period of 99 years. A 20% stake would be held by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. He said that President Maithripala Sirisena and the Cabinet have approved the project.
Samarawickrama said that they will once again re visit this deal in a bid to iron out any disadvantageous points to Sri Lanka. Samarawickrama said the 80 percent stake was also still under negotiation.
The minister also said that in addition to paying US Dollar 1.1 billion CMPH would also invest a further US 600 million to install gantry cranes and port handling equipment and other infrastructure in the Hambantota Port. He also said that they will host a major ceremony next week in Hambantota Harbour to flag off a series of Southern development projects.
Samarawickrama further said that there is a total of over 1,000 acres in the Hambantota Port and in addition economic zones would be set up in several other areas in the Southern province. We will not take all the land for development in and around the Hambantota Port as accused by the opposition, he said. Samarawickrama ensured that only less than 5% of land occupied by the people may be used and they would be paid compensation.
Several senior ministers including Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga have also been appointed to study the deal before finalizing it. We will ink the deal latest by the end of January, the minister added. Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake said that the US$ 1.1 billion from the Chinese company would firstly be used for debt servicing. We will first try to settle loans of high interest, he said. The minister recalled that when the Hambantota Port, Suriyawewa Stadium and the Mattala Airport were built, several families were relocated. The total number of families exceeded 1,500. He questioned as to why people did not make any noise during that time
Similarly when the Colombo Port terminals, SAGT and CICT were leased out there was no opposition, he said.
Commenting on the economy Karunanayake said that today the unity government with prudent economic measures has turned the economy around which was in the intensive care unit.

The govt will move along on a golden journey this year: Grero
The government will protect the unitary status of the country and lay the ground work to eradicate poverty, Higher Education State Minister Mohan Lal Grero said yesterday.
"We will move along a golden journey this year after solving social, economic and policy issues prevailing in the country. Although this is a new government, we have been able to take far reaching steps during a short period for the success of the country," he told a media briefing in Colombo yesterday.
Grero said the SLFP will contest future elections under the hand symbol and win the polls.
"We will formulate future plans of the government under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena to march forward towards success. No one can topple this government and it can only be done democratically. We have to face the reality and face problems to march forward into the future," the state minister said.
He said earlier, the system was not bringing up various proposals to the correct places. "This has been changed today and correct proposals are channelled to the relevant places. There could have been more aims to develop the country under the re-gaining Sri Lanka programme of the UNP. It is time to implement those proposals as well," Grero said.
The state minister said at one time, changing a Constitution was only a dream.
"But today, people's proposals have been taken into consideration while the suggestions of Committees were presented to formulate the Draft, he said.
The new Constitution will give foremost place to Buddhism and will also protect the unitary states of the country. Since there is freedom of expression today, there are a lot of different views and debates. Arguments have also arisen in all parts of the country," Grero said.
He said the main cause for the countrys economic problems is that our debt servicing exceeds the nations income.
"There is grace period after each loan. But afterwards, we have to pay huge sums. This is why this government has to face a difficult phase. Earlier, there was no opportunity to confront hidden problems, the state minister said.
But today, we can face all problems openly and confidently. If this government was not elected, we would have to face problems caused by economic sanctions and human rights issues," Grero said.

Rex Tillerson eyes $180m payout  to cut Exxon ties
The former Exxon chairman and chief executive chosen by Donald Trump for US secretary of state will receive $180m to cut financial ties with the firm.
The arrangement will mean Rex Tillerson meets the conflict of interest requirements for the role, Exxon said.
The firm said it would cancel the two million shares Tillerson was due to receive as part of its executive pay programme and put the equivalent cash into an independently managed trust. Tillerson left Exxon on 31 December.
The payout, which will only take place if Tillerson is confirmed in the new role, is aimed at addressing concerns the former Exxon executive could favour the oil giant, or his own interests while in office.
The 64-year-old Texan worked for Exxon Mobil for 40 years, including in the US, Yemen and Russia. His nomination has come under intense scrutiny over his perceived close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and for the potential benefits for Exxon and the oi l industry more broadly if he presides over the State Department.
Tillerson was due to retire in March this year, but the date was brought forward to 31 December after he was nominated by President-elect Trump. Exxon said the independently managed trust would be banned from investing in Exxon shares but could still buy other assets. BBC News

Amaraweera pooh-poohs Htota Harbour sale
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera stressed that the Hambantota Harbour will never be sold to anyone or an agreement in this regard will not be signed tomorrow.
He was addressing the weekly SLFP media briefing at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday. Minister Amaraweera said that the SLFP will not allow anyone to sell the Hambantota harbour but however the harbour should be converted to a profit making venture as the harbour is a huge burden to the countrys economy at present.
I dare say that such a agreement will not be signed as there is no such agreement drafted yet. A ministerial subcommittee will be appointed to look into the utilisation of the Hambantota harbour. Accordingly, a subcommittee will recommend the terms and conditions of the PPA agreement regarding to the issue, he said.
He said the harbour had been constructed with a US$ 1.3 billion loan obtained from China by the then government at an interest rate of 6.3 percent and three percent. "The government is now paying instalments and interest for the loan. Under this, Rs. 8,640 million was paid last year and Rs. 9,350 million should be paid in 2017. The amount in 2018 will be Rs. 9,950 million and from 2020, over Rs. 17,000 million will have to be paid until 2035," Amaraweera said.
Therefore, there is no alternative than running the harbour as a public -private partnership, he said.
Questioned whether the 15,000 acre land is to be given to China for the proposed industrial zone, he said there was no truth in the story.
He said only 200 families living in the Hambantota Harbour area will have to be relocated.
Certain persons are making allegations that 35,000 families in Hambantota have been evacuated to release 15,000 acres of land for the Chinese industrial zone. Only bare land will be allocated to the industrial zone," he added.
Only environmental friendly industries will be allowed to be established by a committee appointed to look into environment protection, the minister said. Minister Amaraweera said the Ranminithenna Tele-Cine Village will never be privatised as certain artistes pointed out.
Moreover, the government will never allow China to use the Hambantota harbour for their Naval activities, he said.

Over 50 selected to import rice from January 20: Yapa
Around 50 rice importers have been selected to import 100,000 MT of rice by January 20 as a remedy to the scarcity of rice and to bring down the price of rice, Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said.
He said the process of registering rice importers will be completed by January 4. Abeywardena said under this process, suitable parties for rice importation were selected. "The selected parties can import rice under the direct supervision of the government.The decision on rice imports is jointly taken by a committee of the Trade Ministry and the Committee appointed on the Cost of Living. It is up to the joint committee to take measures on rice importation including calculating the volume of rice to be imported," the state minister said.
Questioned why the government was not taking prompt action against the high price of rice, Abeywardena said a price control for rice will be implemented soon.
The state minister said that out of 800,000 acres of paddy lands, only 240,000 acres could be cultivated this season due to the drought and water shortage. This is the main reason for the price hike of rice, he said.

'Bankrupt politicians shedding crocodile tears'
A group of bankrupt politicians are launching a sinister plan to build up public opinion against the development drive by stating that 15,000 acres in Hambantota will be handed over to the Chinese under the Southern Development Plan and Buddhist places of worship and archaeologically valuable sites will be destroyed, the Government Information Department stated in a release yesterday.
The release stated the most noteworthy fact to be considered is the shedding of crocodile tears by the very groups that agreed to fully hand over the Hambantota port to the China Harbour Corporation.
"Those who shed crocodile tears are also responsible in attacking the Dalada Maligawa and attempting to divide the Malwatte Chapter," the release stated.
It added: "A number of agreements with different investors are expected to be signed under the Southern Development Plan and only the Framework Agreement on the development of the Port has been signed so far. Discussions on certain other agreements are progressing while still other agreements are not yet even discussed.
Further, the relevant ministers will in turn inform all parties including the Maha Nayake Theras of other agreements that will be signed in the future.
The Hambantota Port will be transformed into an active and successful port by increasing the number of goods exported through it. Hence, opportunities should be made available to ship goods newly produced in near-by factories. It is estimated that at least 1,500 factories are required to attain this objective. It is also estimated that land to the extent of 15,000 acres will be required for the factories, ware houses, hostels for employee and their recreational facilities.
What would actually happen is the identification and allocation of land only. They will be handed over to factories and other constructions as investors come.
In this way, less than 4,000 acres in the Hambantota district are to be identified for development purposes. What should be emphasised is that 95 percent of proposed land belonged to the state.
Accordingly, only five percent of private land will be acquired for this gigantic project. The government will provide not only a special compensation payment but will also grant special concessions for houses and cultivations in the said lands.
This method has been implemented in acquiring land for development purposes in many districts and the people have happily given their lands for the development of the country.
The world trend in launching a development drive is to allocate land early.
Examples could be found not only in the world but also in neighbouring Tamil Nadu, India. Sri Lankans who have travelled from Chennai to Kanchipuram have seen with their own eyes how land had been allocated for industrial zones adjoining roads.
Similarly it is a blatant lie to say that 15,000 acres in Hambantota will be handed over to China. Different investors from different countries will arrive to the industrial, technological and tourism zones constructed under the plan. Investments by investors will provide 300,000 direct employment opportunities and another indirect means of income to several hundreds of thousands.
Acquisition of land will not affect Buddhist or any other religious place of worship.
Historical heritage sites will also not be endangered. The Yahapalana government has worked its development plans adopting methods for defending, preserving and developing such important locations. Accordingly, it will be the responsibility of all new factories to nurture and develop near-by places of worship.
Since the true situation has been described, we appeal to all Sri Lankans not to be deceived by bankrupt politicians and individuals who burgled the national heritage in the guise of circuses such as Deyata Kirula, bombed the Dalada Maligawa, patronised, motor races and cabaret performances in the vicinity of the Dalada Maligawa thereby infringing the religious dignity and sanctity and not only engaged in dividing the Maha Sangha but also escalating communalism and religious discord."

LSSP rejects CTF recommendations
The Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) vehemently rejects the recommendations by the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTF) and urges the government to reject them and refrain from implementing them, LSSP Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana said.
Addressing a press briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said it will totally destroy the existing reconciliation and also create a huge conflict in the country making it another country in the Middle East. The recommendations are based on the 'Darusman Committee Report' which contains inaccurate and fabricated facts such as killing 40,000 Tamil civilians during the last days of the humanitarian operation.
But the actual and accepted number by the UN and the entire world is between 7,000 to 8,000, Prof Vitharana said. He said all countries where foreign and international judge or judges were involved ended up with taking all political and military leaders to the International Court of Criminal Justice, prosecuting them and convicting them for committing war crimes.
"The same will happen in Sri Lanka if the CTF recommendations are implemented," Prof. Vitharana said.
He said according to military leaders, the Sri Lankan armed forces did not use multi barrel rockets and only used arms that could attack short distances to defeat the LTTE. It was the LTTE which killed civilians. According to scientific calculations, if 40,000 civilians were killed there would have been around 200,000 casualties. The entire Sri Lanka, except the Western Province, does not have 200,000 beds in hospitals, he added.

A special discussion to resolve problems of those who lost lands due to the construction of the Central Expressway was held at the Gampaha District Secretariat Office headed by Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella recently. While the majority of the problems were looked into, decisions were made to compensate those who lost their lands.
Minister Kiriella provided solutions to issues faced by the people.
The Minister said when the new government came into power, not an inch of land for the Colombo-Kandy Expressway was measured. But within the past two years, the Survey Department has measured the 22,000 blocks of land. The Divisional Secretariat Office, Valuation Department, District Secretariat have taken estimates, takeover measures for the 22,000 blocks of land, he said.
The minister said it is the people from the South who will benefit from this. Pilgrims can come to the Dalada Maligawa within an hour once it is completed, he said.
Nine Rajamaha Viharas were lost when the Mahaweli Development programme commenced. Over 100,000 families from Teldeniya, Kotmale and Kundasale left to settle in Giradurukotte. The expressway should have begun over 10 years ago, he said.

Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTF) Secretary Dr.Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu said they cannot guarantee what the governments decisions would be with regard to the recommendations presented in the CTF final report.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Government Information Department,Dr.Saravanamuttu highlighted that CTF focused on the four mechanisms proposed by the government and they are the Truth,Justice, Reconciliation and NonRecurrence Commission (TJRNRC), Office of Missing Persons (OMP), Office of Reparations and the Judicial Mechanism with a special counsel.
He added that the task force was also seeking suggestions on mechanisms, process and measures that would bring about justice, truth and reconciliation.
Domestic enquiries will not safeguard trust and competency. As a result, we recommended the presence of international judges in every panel. The people we consulted, especially the victims lacked confidence yet they reiterated if they do not get justice under this government, it will never happen, he said.
CTF Chairperson Manouri Muttetuwegama said the recommendations and observations presented by CTF are recommendations which are informed by the views received during the consultations.
The consultation process highlighted the importance placed by the citizens on reconciliation and their hope that the government would heed their views and observations on how it should be advanced, she added.
She further said the task force would take the responsibility for the recommendations that were made and added that this a quest for reality based reconciliation.
Muttetuwegama emphasised that the task force acted impartially and independently.
Gamini Viyangoda said by implementing the recommended mechanisms the government will be making a significant step towards a more democratic,just and equitable Sri Lanka.
He said the CTF expects the government to fulfill the promise made and implement the future reconciliation mechanisms, taking into consideration the views of the public, especially the victims of the conflicts.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist about the statement made by Minister Rajitha Senaratne that international judges will not be allowed to look into domestic issues, Dr.Saravanamuttu said the task force will continue to work as civil society organisations and take measures to implement the proposed reconciliation mechanisms.
Many discussions on this topic are being organised.Civil Society organisations can come up with suggestions to conduct campaigns to establish the proposed mechanisms without delay, he said.

Addressing a press conference in Galle, Ven.Samitha Thera said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who identified China as an economic giant negotiated with it on the diplomatic front to obtain necessary finding for development. When one acted undiplomatically with China, it was bent on creating Chinese colonies the world over because the country was unable to cope with a teeming population. Ven.Samitha said the government had coined the term neo-liberalism to describe its economic policies. Neo-liberalism was being rejected all over the world today. Through neo-liberalism the government was trying to transform the country into a cats paw of powerful nations. Although the government was bragging about a Right to Information Act the agreements.
Signed by it were never transparent. He alleged that the government had undermined democracy by trying all means possible to postpone local elections.
Democracy today had become a mere propaganda slogan. People should unite and rise up to oppose government moves to sell off the country, the Thera said.

Hambantota Port project: Committee to finalise agreements
Joint venture agreement to be signed end January:
PM to open Ruhunupura Development Zone on Jan.7 :
Two ministers cut short press conference to attend committee meeting:
Port ownership to Be vested with joint company:
A Ministerial Committee headed by Dr Sarath Amunugama has been appointed to finalise the agreements related to the Hambantota Port joint venture, Strategic Development and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrema said.
The Cabinet Sub-Committee on Economic Management which met on Wednesday appointed this six member Committee which comprises of Ministers Dr Amunugama (Chair), Ravi Karunanayake, Arjuna Ranatunga, Sagala Ratnayaka, Nimal Siripala de Silva and Malik Samarawickrema.
Addressing a press conference jointly with Finance Minister Karunanayake yesterday at the Finance Ministry premises, Minister Samarawickrema said three agreements were being negotiated to give effect to the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) of the Hambantota Port with the China Merchant Port Holdings Company Ltd.
He said a Concession Agreement, Shareholding Agreement and a Lease Agreement would be signed between the Chinese Company and Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) by the end of January. He said the newly appointed committee was having discussions with both these parties at present. Minister Samarawickrema further clarifying said the ownership of the port would go not to China by way of the proposed agreements, but to a joint company set up by the SLPA and China Merchant.
Responding to a question by a journalist, the minister said President Maithripala Sirisena was not opposed to the move. The President is of the view that these agreements should be discussed at the Cabinet and sent for Attorney Generals approval prior to signing he said.
The minister said the Ruhunupura Development Zone would be ceremoniously commenced on January 7 with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Chief Guest. He said the Chinese Ambassador would also attend this ceremony.
The minister dismissing the Joint Opposition criticism on the Economic Zone in the South reiterated that no private land, property or place of religious worship would be taken over forcefully for the purpose. Out of the proposed 15,000 acres, we can find about 4,000-5,000 acres from Hambantota and the rest from areas such as Monaragala, Embilipitiya and Matara. As a percentage less than 5 percent of private lands will be used for the purpose with the consent of their owners and after paying due compensation he said.
Minister Karunanayake bolstering this position reminded that about 1,600 families were evicted to construct Magampura Port. Another 610 families were evicted for its second phase and 455 families were evicted for its third phase. About 500-600 families were evicted to construct the Mattala International Airport. The Joint Opposition objects when we are trying to make these ventures commercially viable while generating thousands of jobs he said.
The Finance Minister explaining on the debt burden created by the Hambantota port, said the country lost Rs 90 million in 2011, Rs 718 million in 2012, Rs 1925 in 2013, Rs 9141 million in 2014, Rs 9,887 million in 2015 and Rs 9,629 million in 2016 to settle loan installments and interests of the loan obtained to construct the port. He added the Rs 10,656 million is needed to service this debt in 2018.
Minister Karunanayake further said the State Revenue in 2016 was Rs 1660 billion, adding that this was Rs 1461 billion in 2015, Rs 1,205 billion in 2014, Rs 1153 billion in 2013 and Rs 1068 billion in 2012. He added curbing of waste and corruption helped to increase the state revenue. He pointed out the Auditor General in his latest report has estimated a loss of Rs 15 billion from rice importation in 2014. The two ministers however cut short the press conference to attend the ongoing meeting of the ministerial committee discussing the Hambantota Port agreements, despite the calls by journalists, who were over loaded with questions, to remain and take up their questions.

UN report recommends hybrid court

A UN report has identified patterns of grave violations in Sri Lanka between 2002 and 2011, strongly indicating that war crimes and crimes against humanity were most likely committed by both sides to the conflict.
The report recommends the establishment of a hybrid special court, integrating international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators, as an essential step towards justice.
Our investigation has laid bare the horrific level of violations and abuses that occurred in Sri Lanka, including indiscriminate shelling, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, harrowing accounts of torture and sexual violence, recruitment of children and other grave crimes,the High Commissioner said. Importantly, the report reveals violations that are among the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole.
This report is being presented in a new political context in Sri Lanka, which offers grounds for hope, Zeid said. It is crucial that this historic opportunity for truly fundamental change is not allowed to slip.
Among the most serious crimes documented in the report are the following:
Numerous unlawful killings between 2002 and 2011, were allegedly committed by both parties, as well as by paramilitary groups linked to the security forces.
Tamil politicians, humanitarian workers, journalists and ordinary civilians were among the alleged victims of Sri Lankan security forces and associated paramilitaries.
There appear to have been discernible patterns of killings, for instance, in the vicinity of security force checkpoints and military bases, and also of extrajudicial killings of individuals while in the custody of security forces, including people who were captured or surrendered at the end of the conflict.
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) also reportedly killed Tamil, Muslim and Sinhalese civilians, through indiscriminate suicide bombings and mine attacks, as well as assassinations of individuals including public officials, academics and dissenting Tamil political figures.
One shocking finding of the investigation was the extent to which sexual violence was committed against detainees, often extremely brutally, by the Sri Lankan security forces, with men as likely to be victims as women.
Harrowing testimony from 30 survivors of sexual violence who were interviewed indicates that incidents of sexual violence were not isolated acts but part of a deliberate policy to inflict torture, following similar patterns and using similar tools. The report describes sexual torture which occurred during interrogation sessions, and also patterns of rape, much of which appeared to occur outside of interrogations sessions.
Sexual torture was performed in a wide range of detention locations by different security forces, both during and after the conflict.
Not a single perpetrator of sexual violence related to the armed conflict is so far known to have been convicted.
Enforced disappearances affected tens of thousands of Sri Lankans for decades, including throughout the 26-year armed conflict with the LTTE.
There are reasonable grounds to believe that enforced disappearances may have been committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population.
In particular, there are reasonable grounds to believe that a large number of individuals who surrendered during the final phase of the war were disappeared, and remain unaccounted for.
Many others, including people not directly linked to the conflict, disappeared, typically after abduction in white vans.
Brutal use of torture by the Sri Lankan security forces was widespread throughout the decade covered by the report, and in particular during the immediate aftermath of the conflict. Some of the more commonly used centres had rooms that were set up with torture equipment, illustrating the premeditated and systematic nature of the use of torture.
These rooms contained objects including metal bars and poles for beatings, barrels of water used for waterboarding, and pulleys from which victims were suspended.
Victims interviewed for the report described seeing bloodstains on the walls or floors of these rooms, and described their own torture in detail.
Information indicates patterns of abductions leading to forced recruitment of adults by the LTTE, which intensified towards the end of the conflict.
Extensive recruitment and use of children in armed conflict by the LTTE and by the paramilitary Karuna group, which supported the Government following its spilt from the LTTE in 2004, was also documented. Children were often recruited by force from homes, schools, temples and checkpoints, and, after basic training were sent to the frontlines.
According to numerous reports, in the last few months of the conflict, the LTTE increasingly recruited children below the age of 15. These practices would amount to war crimes if established in a court of law.
The report documents years of denials and cover-ups, failure to carry out prompt investigations, stalled investigations and reprisals against the family members of victims and others who have pushed for justice.
It notes that the repeated failure of successive domestic inquiries to bring justice has led to scepticism, anger and mistrust on the part of victims, particularly since many of the structures responsible for the violations and crimes remain in place.
The report demonstrates the systemic weakness in addressing these crimes, especially when the military or security forces are involved.
It also describes reprisals against judicial and other professionals who try to prosecute human-rights related cases involving State officials.
The commitment by the new Government to pursue accountability through a domestic process is commendablebut the unfortunate reality is that Sri Lankas criminal justice system is not yet ready, the report states.
First and foremost is the absence of any reliable system for victim and witness protection.
Second is the inadequacy of Sri Lankas domestic legal framework to deal with international crimes of this magnitude. The third challenge is the degree to which Sri Lankas security sector and justice system have been distorted and corrupted by decades of emergency, conflict and impunity.
The High Commissioner welcomed the positive steps taken by the new Government of President Mathiripala Sirisena since January this year, but said that Sri Lanka must now move forward to dismantle the repressive structures and institutional cultures that remain deeply entrenched after decades of erosion of human rights.
This will not happen overnight, and no one should underestimate the enormity of the task, he said.
We have seen many moments in Sri Lankas history when governments pledged to turn the page and end practices like enforced disappearances, but the failure to address impunity and root out the systemic problems that allowed such abuses to occur meant that the white vans could be, and were, reactivated when needed.
It is imperative that the Government seizes the unique opportunity it has to break the mold of impunity once and for all. This means there must be a root-and-branch transformation of the ways in which institutions and officials operate.

Economy was at ICU, can be transferred to OPD soon: Ravi
The countrys economy was at the ICU when we took office, but it has been recovering over the past two years and it can be soon transferred to the OPD, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The minister made this comment with reference to a recent comment by Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy that the countrys economy was not in the ICU, but at the hospital.
Yes, the economy was at the ICU when former President Mahinda Rajapaksa handed over the country to us. The Central Bank Governor was an attendant at the ICU then. With the prudent economic policy of the government, we will soon restore the ailing economy. The countrys development should be carried forward the way the President, the Prime Minister and the government want, and not the way the Central Bank wants. Our fiscal policy is a success. The monetary policy should be handled by an independent body to support what the government wants, he said. I am surprised of what the Governor had said, but I think most of the media distorted his statement, Karunanayake noted.
The minister also vowed to expose the shady deals in the Central Bank by a handful of close associates of former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal before long, stating that some of those officials were still at play.

Lottery sales agents end strike
The lottery sales agents yesterday called off their strike following discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena.
A member of the All Ceylon Lottery Dealers Association (ACLDA) said that the President had promised to look into the grievances of lottery agents.
The lottery agents boycotted sales for several days to protest the governments decision to increase the price of a lottery ticket by Rs.10. The government had decided to increase the price of lottery from Rs.20 to Rs.30.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had told media earlier that lottery agents protests against the governments decision was unacceptable. The minister said the increase was done with the aim of providing more winning opportunities for the public. Meanwhile, earlier Chairpersons of the National Lotteries Board (NLB) and Development Lotteries Board (DLB) yesterday, urged sweep ticket sellers to carry out their duty promptly.
They noted that if the sellers continuously refrain from selling sweep tickets, new agents will be appointed.
The process of appointing new agents will be completed by next week. It has been planned to end the issue by next week, they said.
NLB Chairman Shamila Perera said that tough action will be taken against sales agents who are engaged in protest campaigns. DLP Chairman Romesh Jayawardena said that dealership of certain agents threatening dealers engaged in sales will be cancelled.
The chairmen said the commission of sales persons had been increased from Rs. 3.50 to Rs. 4 per sweep ticket.
The NLB chairman said sales persons are working on personal agendas and not for the people or clients.

Harsha clarifies on Volkswagen debacle

Deputy Foreign Minister Harsha de Silva issued a personal clarification regarding the Volkswagen deal, in which he detailed why plans with that car manufacturer did not go ahead.
In a evidence based, fact-filled message posted on Facebook the Deputy Minister said,
1. Given I was responsible for the initiation of this project I would like to place the following facts before the public.
2. In my new job as the Deputy Minister of Policy Planning and Economic Affairs I met with the then Ambassador of Germany HE Dr Jurgen Morhard in Early January 2015. At this meeting the Ambassador indicated that Volkswagen had attempted to set up a plant in Sri Lanka since 2008 but failed due to various reasons.
3. I indicated to him that we would be delighted to have VW set up a plant in Sri Lanka and we initiated discussions between the Government and the company.
Of the signing Deputy Minister de Silva said,
1. Having initiated the possible investment, HE the Ambassador and I moved out.
2. We were told the discussions continued among the various stakeholders locally. We were informed that Volkswagens local agent Senok Automobiles representing the carmaker negotiated terms with several government authorities to get necessary clearances.
3. In mid-August 2015 BOI and Senok Automobiles signed an agreement to establish an assembly plant for VW in Kuliyapitiya.
The Deputy Minister quoted the German Embassy Deputy Head of Mission Dr. Michael Dohman as having said during the signing ceremony in August, It is important for the German Embassy to have a big company like Volkswagen in Sri Lanka. Germany is always talking to enterprises to attract them here. People will have to be trained and educated, and many other components are needed, so it will boost the local economy,
On why the deal did not go through, Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva offered this argument:
1. In just a matter of a couple of weeks after signing the agreement, on 3 September 2015, Volkswagen, after months of denial, admitted to the EPA in the US that they had cheated on emissions tests on some of their diesel models in the US. On 18 September 2015, the EPA went public with this admission of guilt.
2. Soon thereafter the VW stock crashed and the senior management was fired. Later some 30,000 jobs were cut and it has thus far cost the carmaker some US$ 18 billion in losses.
The Deputy Minister said that in Sri Lanka,
1. This scandal that rocked VW was a complete shock to everyone, obviously including us in Sri Lanka. Apparently Senok Automobiles who had signed for VW had attempted to save the agreement and continue with the investment as planned.
2. However, at one point, I believe after much negotiation, the Government had decided it would be better not to go with a dedicated VW assembly plant due to possible legal issues that could crop up due to the massive fallout from their emissions scam. This we knew today when the PM explained the sequence of events to us.
3. Given the BOI agreement had still been in place with Senok Automobiles for the original VW assembly I understand that they had rescued the project by agreeing with the BOI to go ahead to establish the plant to assemble various makes of European automobiles.
4. It had been for this assembly plant, renamed Western Automobile, the foundation stone laid for an automobile assembly. At no point at the foundation laying ceremony (which I could not attend) had there been any mention of the plant being for VW.
He adds further,
In fact since I moved out of my earlier portfolio of Deputy Minister of Policy Planning and Economic Affairs to the new one in the Foreign Ministry in August 2015, I had no dealings with the project and was sincerely unaware of the various changes until it was explained today. I would appreciate that fact be respected.
I hope the above explains the confusion and we as a country can be satisfied that the assembly plant is being established and many jobs will be created besides thousands of training opportunities for young people.

The iconic Connaught Place area in the Indian capital, Delhi, will be a no-vehicle zone for three months beginning February, officials say.
All traffic including buses and cars will be banned from the office and shopping district as part of the government's plans to tackle air pollution and congestion in the city.
Park and ride cycle services will be offered to visitors to the area.
Tens of thousands of people visit Connaught Place every day.
The area is part of colonial-era Delhi, often called Lutyens Delhi after the British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, who designed many of the government buildings and graceful bungalows that are now occupied by senior officials.
It is also one of India's most famous commercial and shopping districts, but often remains gridlocked because of rising traffic.
Officials say the three-month-long "pedestrianisation" of the area will test "traffic circulation, the experience of pedestrians and shop owners, management of reclaimed parking lots and traffic load" in the area.
People will be able to reach the area either by metro or by using park and ride bicycles and battery operated vehicles from surrounding areas during the trial.
