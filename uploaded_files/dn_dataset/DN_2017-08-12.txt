Govt should manage public resources
Public resources should be managed under the purview of the government without privatising or entering into agreements with foreign parties, Science and Technology Minister Susil Premajayantha said.
The minister said the Hambantota harbour should have been managed under the government with a capable management without relying on foreign parties.
He said a sound management plan should be implemented to protect public resources.
If any shortcoming with the management plan arises, a fresh management plan should be implemented.
The country has capable personnel to manage institutions. We are not utilising them for the betterment of the country, he said.
Privatisation or relying on foreign parties is not an answer to protect state institutions, the minister said.

60 years of Test Match Special remembered
Hours before the start of the 1968 Ashes, news came through from Los Angeles that Senator Robert Kennedy had died, the day after he was shot in his moment of triumph at the California presidential primary. John Arlott welcomed listeners to Test Match Special from Old Trafford on this sombre morning of world news. Maybe that was not the precise phrase, but I remember with ringing clarity the Arlottian word sombre. It contained a multitude of meanings: that we knew what had happened; that it mattered to us as human beings; and that, in due course  probably over much claret, in Arlotts case  we would discuss its meaning. But for now the cricket would go on, and that was the business in hand.
Would such an event penetrate a modern cricket TV commentary box Would the blazered Mammonites even mention it
There is a fundamental difference between the broadcasting of cricket on radio and on television, and it has grown wider with the years. On TV, the orthodoxy is that This Is Thrilling And It Really Matters, no matter what. On radio, there is a tacit pact with the listener, who will be registering the cricket as an agreeable extra in their own day-to-day routine. The context is whatever else is worrying us, from sick kids to distant assassinations.
When TMS began, 60 years ago, this hardly needed saying. Everyone involved with the game had lived through the war; some who fought were still playing (Keith Miller, who famously described pressure as a Messerschmitt up your arse, had just retired); almost all the players had done national service; no one was paid much. Yet cricket remained supreme as the summer game.
Now, many professionals have done little in their lives except play cricket, and get paid well, even if no one has heard of them. TV commentators, who are paid exceedingly well, act as though nothing on the planet is as significant as the umpteenth iteration of a computers opinion of an lbw. In the meantime, cricket is disappearing from Britains parks, greens and consciousness to its new home, up its own backside.
Against this background, TMS is a miraculous survivor. It is the games prime ambassador to the outside world, as it has been since it began, on May 30, 1957. It has changed since then, of course it has. But, unlike the game it serves, it has changed organically, in keeping with its own traditions. Survival rests on a number of happy accidents. One is stability. There have only ever been three producers: Michael Tuke-Hastings for 16 years, Peter Baxter for 34, Adam Mountford for the past decade.
Neil Durden-Smith, now the senior surviving TMS commentator (sounding in his eighties exactly as he did in his thirties), did a handful of Tests in the early 1970s, before concentrating on PR. He remembers how straightforward it all was: You came into the box in the morning, and there would be a note pinned up with your times, and thats what you did. You just sat down and got on with it. If you were last on, you had to hand over to Jim Swanton to do the summary. It was very relaxed, very informal.
Indeed. Tuke-Hastings had a good many other BBC responsibilities, such as producing quizzes. He oversaw the non-London Tests from a distance, as did Baxter in the early days, leaving the on-the-spot role to regional men, including Dick Maddock in the Midlands and an interesting cove in the North called Don Mosey. But the informality had a firm foundation. The basis of TMS is that of all great art: a disciplined line combined with a wild imagination. Shane Warnes bowling worked the same way. For the commentators, that means describing every ball accurately, giving the score regularly and judging the mood astutely: when to concentrate on the game, and when to discuss last nights dinner, Blowerss trousers, or the latest email from Mongolia.
Deviation from those rules can be fatal. Alan Gibson rivalled Arlott in his gifts as a commentator: he had a voice like honey and a marvellous way with words. Like Arlott, he enjoyed a drink; unlike Arlott, he could not judge his intake. He was despatched after a slurred performance at Headingley in 1975.
It was Arlott who created the tone. More than anyone else, he reached out beyond the core audience. People would say  especially women, who were considered tangential to the sport in those distant days  that they liked him because he didnt talk about the cricket. He did, but he made it accessible, using his broad sensibilities, wit and command of metaphor. From 1946, long before TMS brought in ball-by-ball coverage, Arlott set the standard. It did not at first include much hilarity. That didnt come until Brian Johnston was added to the team in 1966; he joined it full-time when he was booted off TV four years later. Producers said he did not have the discipline to match his words to the pictures. Johnston said: The emphasis was to be on an analysis of technique and tactics So be it. But it was not my cup of tea.
Radio and TV coverage now went in different directions. Johnstons 24 years on TMS helped encourage the habit (more difficult now that satellites are involved) of turning the radio on and the TV sound down. And when the BBCs TV coverage finally expired in 1999, it did so  for all Richie Benauds brilliance  mainly of boredom.
Yet the idyllic image of choccy cake and old chestnuts in the radio box was not quite accurate. The two stars of the 1970s  Arlott and Johnston  were far from close friends. Arlott and Tuke-Hastings both retired to the island of Alderney (population: 2,000 or so) but did not speak. Mosey, who joined the commentary team in 1974, could start a fight in an empty room. No one who scored as meticulously as Bill Frindall was likely to be happy-go-lucky.
But the upshot was a remarkable creative tension. TMS was a trailblazer both in cricket  its influence yanked Australian commentary away from its old solemnity  and beyond. Brough Scott, host of Channel 4s once-stylish (and now sadly lost) horse racing, described his programmes formula as a mix of Test Match Special and drive time. Cricket was also a flagship for the dear old wireless itself. Once it was assumed that radio would slowly wither. TMS is one of the reasons it has done no such thing.
And the programme has had a knack of chance discoveries. On the Saturday of the 1976 Lords Test  a rare damp day in that blazing summer  the panel were allowed to keep chatting, instead of handing back to the studio. The BBC found people enjoyed it as much as, or more than, the actual cricket. Jonathan Agnew, an intermittently excellent fast bowler, turned out to be a consistently excellent broadcaster, whose skills and growing stature helped lead the programme almost seamlessly through the deaths of Frindall, Christopher Martin-Jenkins and now Tony Cozier, all well before their powers might have waned.
There was a rocky patch in the mid-to-late 2000s. Clouds appeared during the last years of Baxters long, sunny reign in the shape of men in suits who wanted the measured tones of TMS to match the zippier style of Radio 5. The rota had indeed become too much of a closed shop. But Baxter was pushed into giving young men from the sports room their commentary debuts, whether he was convinced by them or not.
Among those was Arlo White, a highly competent broadcaster who was chosen for the post-2005 Ashes tour of Pakistan, and then for a couple of home Tests. White had played for Leicestershire Under-11s, but when he commentated in his head it was on football, and he readily admits he was not exactly Swantonian in his grasp of cricketing lore and history. He was monstered in the press, mainly by the serial controversialist Michael Henderson, whose other TMS victims have included Vic Marks, Ed Smith, Alison Mitchell  and Swanton. The criticism stung and hurt, says White. But I got to see some great places and worked with some of the worlds most talented broadcasters, and I wouldnt take a second of it back. Anything I do now is based on what I learned on TMS. Hes fine: chief English soccer commentator for NBC, purveyors of the Premier League to the eager Americans.
Mountford himself seemed to make a shaky start. The commentary team settled down, but the summarisers went a bit haywire. For most of TMSs life, this role had comprised serial duopolies: Freddie Brown and Norman Yardley; Trevor Bailey and Fred Trueman; Marks and Mike Selvey. Now there was a cacophony of voices, many brought over from Mountfords previous berth on Radio 5, and not all the voices were any good.
But it fell into place quite rapidly. Mountford had unearthed one diamond: Phil Tufnell, a find he credited to CMJ, who had worked with him in Sri Lanka, and said, Hes brilliant. Tufnell, like White, might not be up to speed on Victor Trumper. But his sharp cricket brain and sharper wit have been a huge plus.
For me, there are lingering issues. There is the Geoff Boycott problem. Geoffrey has now discovered that cricket is indeed a team game, and judges it as such; Im not sure he has cottoned on that the same applies to commentary. There also seems to me too much movement in and out of the box, too many different voices in too short a time, the key changes stifling the melody.
Mountford insists this is unavoidable. For years Peter just had to do a list. Now its more like a jigsaw puzzle. Ive got so many other outlets to worry about. Theyre dodging to 5 Live, Radio 1, Radio 2. They might have to nip out of the ground to do TV news, because we dont have the rights, and the cameras are not allowed in. The big change is social media. I might have to get Graeme Swann or Michael Vaughan to do half an hour on Facebook, taking questions from the audience.
But on the whole TMS is in rude health. Mountford hears nothing but support from the BBC hierarchy. It is said British emigres to France settled in the Dordogne because that was the most southerly place with reliable reception of Radio 4 Long Wave. Now the internet takes it across the planet.
Though Frindall was the master statistician of his generation, he had no love of computers and no patience with weird stats. Andrew Samson and his extraordinary database give radio the lead in off-the-wall facts: Player most often out for two in a one-day international Just wait a moment. Women, led by Alison Mitchell, are in the box on their merits and on equal terms.
The most interesting commentator of the new generation is Daniel Norcross, who made his Test debut at Edgbaston last summer. The route to commentary now is usually a slow progress through the BBC ranks (Simon Mann and Mitchell), or playing (Smith), or both (Charlie Dagnall). Norcross made a living for a while playing pub quiz machines, had a spell in the City, and drifted in and out of dot-com jobs before setting up Test Match Sofa, an anarchic internet-based non-rival to the real TMS: a group of blokes watching TV and chatting, with the ECB going berserk and accusing them of destroying the world of sporting media rights. It was the most fun, the most silly enterprise I have ever been involved with, he says. I was doing the one thing I had always wanted to do, even though I had none of the qualifications to do it.
He finally wrote a hopeless gissa-job letter to Mountford, who had a hunch Norcross could do it. I think so too: he has knowledge, enthusiasm and a smile in his voice. And, like the policeman/poet Arlott, an unusual perspective. Even more improbable is the one-day scorer Andy Zaltzman. It is not unusual for TMS to be a route into comedy gigs; Zaltzman has done it the other way round. But he is a serious scorer nonetheless.
In his last years, I got to know Rex Alston, the straight-man commentator of the early TMS. He was a classic public-school master of his generation: benign and humorous, but deeply conservative. He would have been startled out of his wits by the clown-haired Zaltzman. But they are both legitimate members of a great tradition.
I was standing by the school dining hall when I heard Arlott say sombre. While I was listening to Norcross make his debut 48 years later, I was chopping thistles. I heard England beat West Indies at Lords in 2000 from the car park at a nieces wedding. Funny how these associations remain in the mind more readily than the Tests one actually saw.
For others, it can be even more important. Thank you, TMS, a listener in Ankara wrote last year. Youve meant more than cricket for us. It has never been more vital to our game, and our lives.  The Telegraph

Academics slam Constitution-making process
Several academics questioned the governments Constitution-making process at a public forum at the University of Colombo on Thursday.
Guruparan Kumaravadivel, a senior lecturer at the University of Jaffna, said the assumption that a majoritarian political process could deliver Constitutional reform for minority groups was fundamentally flawed.
He said the act of crafting a Constitution in post-conflict societies, like South Africa and North Ireland, included pre-Constitutional agreements, in which different parties agreed on the basic terms of what should be included in a new Constitution, before legal drafting began.
Here, weve had nothing of that sort, he said.
The government is postponing debate on divisive ideological issues facing the country, he said.
Different groups are receiving different stories about what the new Constitution might contain. He cited the example of Tamil papers reporting that the new Constitution would identify Sri Lanka as a unitary state in its Sinhala draft and not in its Tamil one.
The same Constitution can be sold as apple juice to one community and pineapple juice to another, he said.
Dr. Daniel Bass, the South Asia Director at Cornell University, said the conflict was resolved on the battlefield, rather than at the negotiating table in Sri Lanka.

AG urged to expedite action
Eighty seven files relating to mega scale fraud and corruption:
Legal advice sought on completion of FCID, CID probes :
AGs Dept. is an independent body now :
National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha De Silva urged the Attorney General to expidite legal action relating to 87 files, which have been sent to the Attorney Generals Department.
He said that 87 files relating to various mega scale frauds and corruptions have been forwarded to Attorney Generals Department to seek legal advice after completing the investigations by various institutions such as FCID, CID and so on, but the Department has failed to take action on these files yet.
But it can be observed that there is a delay in taking legal action with regard to these files by the Attorney Generals Department.
Deputy Minister De Silva and Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara were speaking at a media briefing at Sirikotha yesterday. The lethargic attitude of the Attorney Generals Department is questionable. With the investigations carried out by the Attorney Generals Department into Treasury Bond issue, it can be noticed that the Department can work efficiently.
Deputy Minister De Silva said that certain UNP members have pointed out this situation to the Prime Minister and Justice Minister and are looking forward to a favourable response.
He said that unlike the former regime, the Attorney General Department is an independent body now under the Justice Ministry.
The Attorney General Department was under former President Mahinda Rajapaksa during his regime, he said. The resignation of Ravi Karunanayake from his portfolio resulted in the beginning of a new political culture, which the country never experienced during the last regime, Deputy Minister de Silva said.
He said under the Good Governance government this is the beginning of a new political culture. Besides, it symbolises the stance of the UNP.
The Deputy Minister added that no minister had resigned or an investigation carried out into a number of mega scale frauds and corruptions that had allegedly taken place during the regime of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. During the last regime, billions of rupees in public funds were misused.
We had been raising our voice against various frauds and monetary malpractices, murders such as the Hedging Agreement, Central Bank frauds, underhand agreements,share market frauds, Greek Bond issue, Hambantota Commonwealth Games, frauds of airports and harbours etc.
He said that Employee Trust Fund (ETF) could not be summoned before the Parliamentary Accounts Committee for years.
Unlike that period, the Attorney Generals Department is conducting investigations into allegations relating to Government Ministers.
Minister de Silva said that the Supreme Court decided that a former Finance Ministry Secretary was not suitable for holding any position in government. But, he was reinstated into service by the previous regime.
When questioned about Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakhes statement regarding the Hambantota Port Agreement, the Deputy Minister said that no one has the ethical right to criticise the collective decision taken at the Cabinet meeting.

UNP Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara said Public Enterprise Development State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena should correct the figures in his calculation over the Treasury Bond issue.
He, while addressing the media had said that the loss of the Treasury Bond issue exceeds Rs.1 trillion. It cannot be such an amount. Then he should come before the media and correct figures, Bandara said.
MP Bandara was addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday.
He said that UNP Parliamentarians have requested the President to appoint five more Presidential Commissions to inquire into five mega scale frauds and corruption that took place during the last regime. However, we have not yet decided these five, he said.
When asked he said that the UNP Parliamentarians met the Prime Minister on Thursday to seek his assistant to expedite the process of taking legal action against mega scale frauds and corruption that took place during the last regime.
He said that UNP Parliamentarians may protest opposite the Atterney Generals Department urging that investigations into these mega scale frauds, corruption and monetary misconducts be expedited.

BASL to intervene into Uma Oya FR petition
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) yesterday sought the Supreme Courts permission into the Fundamental Rights petition filed by Centre for Environmental Justice and four residents of the Bandarawela area who have been victimised as a result of the Uma Oya multipurpose Project.
This request is to be considered on September 29 by the Supreme Court.
Meanwhile, the petitioners yesterday requested the authorities not to goahead with the Uma Oya project without a new Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report.
On a previous occasion, the Attorney General had informed the Supreme Court that two remaining drinking water projects out of four targeting the people affected by Uma Oya multi-purpose project are to be completed soon.
The Supreme Court was further informed by the Attorney General that the Provincial Director of Agricultural in the Uva Province has taken the necessary steps to grant compensation for the farmers whose crops were destroyed by Uma Oya multipurpose project. On a previous occasion, the Supreme Court had ordered the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment to complete its drinking water projects by early this year.
The Attorney General had earlier submitted in Court, a copy of Cabinet memorandum issued regarding the Uma Oya project. The cabinet memorandum submitted by the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment had identified the main socio-economic problems in the areas affected by the Uma Oya project.
The Cabinet memorandum stated; the ingress of water into the head face tunnel which occurred on December 4, 2014 resulted in some socio-economic problems including drying up of wells, developing cracks in houses, damaging crops around the areas of water ingress into tunnel located in the District Secretariat areas of Bandarawela and Ella.
The petitioners claim that as a result of the Uma Oya project, not only have their homes and crops been destroyed, but they have lost access to clean drinking water, citing this as a violation of their fundamental rights.
Secretary to the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment N. Rupasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Irrigation and Agriculture, the Central Environment Authority and the Attorney General have been named as respondents in the petition. Counsel Ravindranath Dabare with Sugath Atapattu appeared for the petitioners.
Deputy Solicitor General Palinda Ranasinghe appeared for the Attorney General.

Bond Commission : Kodagoda cannot fabricate SMSs - ASG
Kodagoda will never fabricate SMSs - Justice Jayawardena :
Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Yasantha Kodagoda yesterday said 'certain illinformed people' are casting aspersions on him unaware of the technical knowhow employed to scan data extracted from Arjun Aloysiuss mobile phone.
Kodagoda made these observations briefing the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday (11) on data extraction process of the laptop computer surrendered to the CID by former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran and his son-in-law,Arjun Aloysius.
Kodagoda pointed out that he is not a genius to scan 8600 pages in two nights.Obviously some people think so.But the literate will know that it is done through a search engine.
The Attorney General submitted a document on August 2, 2017 to the Treasury Bond Commission,of 8600 pages including data derived from Arjun Aloysius mobile phone. 25 pages of the said document were used by the AG when leading evidence through former Minister Ravi Karunanayake who testified before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury Bond issue on August 2. Certain comments were made regarding the examination process of this said 8600 pages document in Parliament yesterday (10).
Explaining how the examination of the said document took place, Kodagoda said the original data we extracted from the mobile phone, were thereafter converted into a conventional PDF document. And in that document there is the option for search.That is how we were able to scan 8600 pages of document in 48 hours to find relevant evidence.
Opting for a stylistic device in literature, the ASG referred to himself in third person as he pointed out Kodagoda cannot fabricate SMSs! contrary to the allegations levelled against him.
Commissioner Supreme Court Judge P.S. Jayawardena contributed stating that Kodagoda will never fabricate SMSs.
Kodagoda also pointed out that the PDF file including mobile phone data, was in an unalterable format.
Subsequently Arjun Mahendrans legal counsel Chanaka de Silva rose. These submissions are in answer to statements that may or may have not been made elsewhere. Do we need to be dealing with these statements he asked.
I need to! This is the only forum I have. It has everything to do with my professional reputation. Kodagoda said. De Silva mused if Kodagoda also meant him when he (Kodagoda) said some people are making allegations, to which Kodagoda replied with a My God! and a flashback to their past at the Attorney Generals Department years back.
ASG Kodagoda informed the PCoI yesterday that a different procedure to the data derivation from the mobile phones will be used when extracting data from a laptop computer.
What is possible for us is to prepare a clone copy of the hard disk of the laptop computer. And therefore we wouldnt have a PDF file of the material extracted from the relevant laptops. What we will have is a mirror image copy of the hard disk. And in the process there will be meaningful attempt to recreate deleted files, Kodagoda explained to the PCoI.
He further said copies of the extracted clone copy will be produced only to the PCoI and Arjun Mahendrans legal counsel.
Speaking on the data derivation from Arjun Mahendrans laptop computer, Commissioner P.S. Jayawardena said :In the extraction of data, there are certain best practices that are followed regarding the security and other concerns.We shall proceed on the assumption that those practices are followed by the CID and that there are no irregularities in extracting the data.
Mahendrans counsel Chanaka de Silva told the PCoI that there is no legislation or best practice in Sri Lanka regarding extracting data from digital devices and expressed the importance of the PCoI guiding the process under whatever the best practices adopted by the CID when extracting data from his clients laptop.
He also said the when employing a set of best practices, there should be a unanimity. De Silva also suggested selecting the latest version of these best practices as well.
The AG panel previously provided information to the PCoI on international best practices followed by the USA Justice Department and UK Metropolitan Police when a digital forensic examination is conducted.
The PCoI will sit again on Monday (14).

Bus Priority Lanes for Colombo city, suburbs planned
The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry has taken measures to introduce Bus Priority Lanes (BPL) for Colombo city and the suburbs only during the rush hours from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. with the intention of reducing traffic congestion, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He made this observation at a media conference held at Megapolis and Western Development Ministry in Suhurupaya, Battaramulla yesterday.
Improvement of public transport system of the city is the best way to reduce traffic congestion. A one-week pilot project on Bus Priority Lane will be introduced from Rajagiriya to Ayurveda junction.
Considering the success of this pilot project, the Ministry has taken measures to introduce BPL's to other areas also. This will also improve road discipline, the Minister said.
Two BPLs will be implemented on August 15 from the Kurusa Junction in Moratuwa to the Katubedda junction and on the Galle Road section starting near the Savoy Cinema, Wellawatte up to Bambalapitiya junction.
Bus priority lanes from Katubedda Junction to Maliban Junction and Bambalapitiya Junction to Pittala Junction will be introduced on August 22.
Priority lanes between Polduwa Junction and Borella Ayurveda junction and Town Hall to Thummulla Junction will be implemented from August 29. BPLs from Technical junction to Colombo Fort and Colombo Fort to Slave Island will be implemented on September 5. BPL between Slave Island and Colombo Fort will be implemented on Spetember 12 and Borella to Maradana will be introduced on November 30.

Certain incidents harm good governance: Premajayantha
Science and Technology Minister Susil Premajayantha said certain incidents harm the good governance concept. He is unhappy with the way the government moves on.
The minister said so addressing the media at the SLFP weekly media briefing at the SLFP headquarters on Thursday.
Minister Premajayantha said he is disgruntled about the way the government is heading. Some of its attitudes are against the norms of good governance, he said.
The Central Committee (CC) of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will consider whether the joint government should continue after the completion of two years, he said.
The CC should evaluate the success of the government prior to deciding whether to quit the government or not, he said.
Speaking on the Treasury Bond issue, he said the GDP has brought down to 4.7 percent as a result of the bond issue. Many sectors of the country have been affected by the consequences of the bond issue, he said.
He appreciated the measure of the President to appoint a Presidential Commission to investigate into the bond issue.
"Once the Presidential Commission was appointed, some persons of the Joint Opposition claimed that it was a move to conceal the bond issue. However, the same persons, who levelled allegations against the Presidential Commission, are trying to get the credit for it," Minister Premajayantha said.
He said the democratic rights of the people will be affected if elections are not held on time.
The 20th amendment to the Constitution will reform the parliamentary electoral system. Elections should be held on time to safeguard the democratic rights of the people, he said.
By holding elections on time, the government can assess its success, he said.
Speaking on the SAITM issue, the minister said the medical faculty should be closed temporarily to allow undergraduates of state medical faculties to attend lectures. The government can get a policy decision on private medical faculties, he said.

Empowering Youth
Today, the world celebrates youth. The International Youth Day, which falls today will focus on youth empowerment and welfare. This years theme Youth Building Peace is of particular relevance to Sri Lanka, emerging from a bloody conflict that lasted more than 30 years.
International Youth Day 2017 is dedicated to celebrating young peoples contributions to conflict prevention and transformation as well as inclusion, social justice, and sustainable peace. The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is committed to fostering peaceful and inclusive societies and affirmed that Sustainable development cannot be realized without peace and security. It is heartening to note that in Sri Lanka, the youth from both the North and the South are heavily involved in the process of reconciliation and seeking peace.
Peace is essential for the world and even more so for the worlds youth. There is growing recognition that as agents of change, young peoples inclusion in the peace and security agenda and in society more broadly, is the key to building and sustaining peace. Another Security Council Resolution reaffirms the important role youth can play in deterring and resolving conflicts, and notes that are key constituents in ensuring the success of both peacekeeping and peace building efforts. The World Programme of Action for Youth, which provides a policy framework and practical guidelines to improve the situation of young people, also encourages promoting the active involvement of youth in maintaining peace and security.
There are more young people in the world than ever before, creating unprecedented potential for economic and social progress. There are about 1.9 billion young people between the ages of 10 and 24  the largest youth population ever. Many of them are concentrated in developing countries. In fact, in the worlds 48 least developed countries, children or adolescents make up a majority of the population. But too many of these young people see their potential hindered by conflict, extreme poverty, discrimination or lack of information. But with proper investment in their education and opportunities, these young peoples ideas, ideals and innovations could transform the future.
The UN has focused on 15 priority areas for youth empowerment, including Employment, Education, Poverty, Health, Environment, Girls and young women, Globalization, Information and communication technologies, Youth and conflict and Intergenerational relations.
Sri Lanka has an enviable record on empowering youth. The two youth rebellions of 1971 and 1988-89, though rather unfortunate, prompted the authorities to address the genuine grievances of the youth in earnest. The lack of educational and employment opportunities for youth led to widespread frustration among them, which was used by certain political elements to achieve their sinister aims.
One of the first tasks handled by a young Ranil Wickremesinghe as Minister of Youth Affairs in the J.R. Jayewardene Government was spearheading the formation of the National Youth Services Council (NYSC) initially headed by the equally young and dynamic Charitha Ratwatte. All subsequent governments helped the NYSC to expand its range of youth-oriented activities.
Ever since the dark events of 1971, Governments have grappled with the problem of providing more educational and vocational opportunities for youth. A large number of youth are denied higher educational opportunities after O/L and A/L examinations, since the Governments higher educational institutions can accommodate only a limited number of students. The rest of the youth must be provided with alternative avenues for education or employment. This is a major challenge that must be resolved without delay. This also brings to the fore the need for more private higher educational institutions that can accommodate some of these students.
Sri Lanka is one of the few countries in the region where girls are not discriminated against in education and other matters. Thanks to free education and free health care, girls in Sri Lanka fare much better than their counterparts in other developing countries. Sri Lanka also has a very low maternal mortality rate, a problem that affects most developing countries. The country also had to rehabilitate thousands of child soldiers, both boys and girls, who were deprived of education and parental care.
However, Sri Lanka needs to do more to empower youth socially and politically. We are pleased that the Government has brought in regulations to ensure that all political parties have to field a given quota of young persons aged below 35 at the forthcoming Local Government and Provincial Council elections, with an emphasis on fielding more women candidates. We need more young professionals, male and female, to ensure a cleaner political slate.
It may sound like a clich, but youth are our future. It is estimated that the youth population in Sri Lanka is about 4.4 million or 22% of the total population (2011). The youth population by sex indicates that there is an almost equal distribution of 50.23% for males and 49.76% for females. A National Youth Policy has been formulated taking into account all aspects of youth empowerment. The youth must be given every chance to rise and shine and become useful citizens. The country as a whole will prosper when the youth realize their ambitions and aspirations.

Farewell to a wonder of our sporting age
The end is coming. A marvel of this sporting age is one championship away from retirement, 30 seconds or so from consigning himself to history.
The age of Usain Bolt is nearly over and so the present must be cherished.
Bolt, the fastest man in history, one of the greatest sportsmen to have ever lived, will run his last race at the World Athletics Championships in London.
He will retire having left his mark on history: the first man to win three 100m Olympic titles, the world record holder in both the 100m and 200m, a winner of 23 major gold medals.
His legacy is assured. No man has run with such speed or enjoyed such longevity. The 30-year-old's extraordinary achievements will be looked back upon with wonder by future generations.
They will watch replays of the young Bolt of Beijing, hushing the crowd on the starting blocks before bang... history -- his arms raised, thumping his chest, clocking a barely believable 9.69 seconds to shatter the 100m world record.
The 21-year-old's speed was jaw-dropping, the other eight men in a distinguished field left trailing in his wake.
They were in a different race and this 6ft 5in newcomer was from another planet.
Two more gold medals followed on the Chinese capital's lightning-quick track, his 2008 coronation as sprint king complete.
Hearts and imaginations were captured and he has been loved ever since.
THE IRREPLACEABLE JOKER-IN-CHIEF
There have been so many glorious moments.
Berlin in 2009, when the Jamaican reduced his 100m and 200m world records further; London 2012 when all three of his Olympic sprint titles were retained.
Back to Beijing in 2015, older, ailing, but managing to fend off the challenge of twice-banned Justin Gatlin to retain his grip on 100m and 200m world titles.
Then there was Rio last summer, his Olympic farewell ending in further triumph.
Those who will live in a Bolt-less sporting age will wish they had been there, just as we all want to be inside London's Olympic Stadium on Saturday when the history-maker lines up in the 100m final for his last competitive individual race.
The 4x100m relay on August 12 is likely to be his grand encore. The final act of this gilded athletic tale.
There is little point asking who will take over once he is gone. No-one can clown around on the start line and execute excellence like track and field's joker-in-chief.
As the eight-time Olympic champion himself said this week, it will take more than one athlete to fill his vibrant void.
Savor him now because Bolt is irreplaceable.
"It's a simple formula that doesn't actually work," says Michael Johnson, whose 200m world record was thought unbreakable until Bolt broke it ... twice.
We asked him how his sport will cope without its showman."The idea that you have an athlete who's the best there's ever been in the sport, who just happens to have an electric personality as well," explains Johnson, a four-time Olympic gold medalist, "you're not going to replace that.
"That's not going to come around again. It would be ridiculous to look for it and, I think, the sport has made a mistake by relying on that for the last eight years because he was never going to last forever."
BECOMING A LEGEND
Hoping that the show would go on and on is perhaps forgivable. It is easy to forget that even the seemingly superhuman age, just like the rest of us, no matter how effortless and enjoyable they make winning seem.
A showman supreme, a magnetic personality, he has been likened to Muhammad Ali, though he has stayed away from politics.
He has continued to compete because he knew only sustained success would see him ranked alongside the three-time heavyweight champion and Pele, regarded as the greatest footballer of all time.
He wanted to be "among the greatest," he said before going on to achieve an unprecedented "triple-triple" of Olympic sprint golds in Rio, though he has lost the 4x100m relay gold he won in Beijing as a result of team-mate Nesta Carter's positive doping test.
"I am a legend," Bolt has said a number of times, after winning three golds in London, and again in Rio.
It would be braggadocio from anyone else but, as he himself has explained, he has proved himself to be the best for nearly a decade.
"I feel that if you have done something, it is not bragging," he has said.
But even Ali, like most in life, had to comeback from lows. It added to his legend. Bolt, however, has excelled at major championships no matter what his form or fitness. His only failure was a false start in the 2011 World Championships 100m final.
Yes, he has slowed over the years and the frequency of injuries have increased. At times, the country boy who began racing to buy his mother a washing machine has also struggled for motivation after achieving more than he ever dreamed.
But even Bolt beyond his peak has always managed to be better than the rest.
"He's just a phenomenally talented athlete," says Johnson.
"He's absolutely been tested. I don't think that you could discount anything that he's done over the years. Some of the fastest times in the 100m and 200m have come about during his career."
'YOU HAVE BLESSED US WITH USAIN BOLT'
The sprint freak from a remote Jamaican village has already said his goodbyes to his own; a five-hour farewell in the national stadium in Kingston, a celebration which started with prayers from an ordained minister.
"We thank you God, for you have truly been good to Jamaica," it began. "You have blessed us with doctor, the honorable Usain St Leo Bolt, the embodiment of sportsmanship, who remind us of the gumption and indomitable spirit of the Jamaican people."
Thirty-five thousand people watched their most famous son run his 84th and last race on home soil. Bolt, so those on the inside say, would have preferred for that to have been his farewell.
He is most comfortable at home, living as ordinary a life as a millionaire superstar can. He trains in a public gym, dances in nightclubs. There is no need for private security.
It is when he steps onto foreign soil that people become agog by his presence, which means life on the road is mostly spent in hotels.
"In Jamaica you take it for granted that you can see him every day," says Colin Reid, a photographer who has followed Bolt's career with the Jamaican Observer.
"In the international fraternity, they're awestruck. But he's just like one of us. He lives in Kingston.
He's approachable, he's amiable, I see him around a lot."
What you see is what you get, says Reid, something Bolt has also repeated in numerous reports. He enjoys partying, he is still the boy a teacher once described as being full of "tricks and stories."
BOLT THE THINKER, THE INTELLECTUAL
Hidden behind the tomfoolery on the track, however, is a thoughtfulness, a keen athletics brain and an intense competitive streak.
He is a smiling assassin. His desire to be the best is such that he no longer plays Call of Duty as he cannot cope with not being as good as he used to be.
"He's much different when he's in a much closer setting," says Johnson.
"Unfortunately, I don't think the world has been able to see that he is very thoughtful, highly intellectual about athletics, about sprinting.
"Most people think that he goes out there and that it's easy and he doesn't really care if he wins or loses, that he's just having fun."
Bolt has said he allowed a film crew to follow him in the year leading up to Rio for the movie "I Am Bolt" so people could see how hard he worked; vomit-inducing track sessions, suffering in the gym, early-morning wake-up calls.
Ed Moses, a two-time Olympic champion who dominated the 400m hurdles in a 122-race unbeaten decade, calls Bolt a mathematician, though when later asked his agent Ricky Simms admits he has never heard his client described as such.
"He's an intellectual guy," says Moses.
"He's thought a lot about what it's going to take to get him through the first 40m. He had the tools and resources to put it together and that's why he's great."
Unlike many of history's great talents, Bolt has been appreciated in his own time. For nearly a decade he has radiated in a sport darkened by doping.
Nine of the 30 fastest 100m times, including the top four, are Bolt's. The other 21 marks on that list have been run by athletes who have, at some point, tested positive for doping.
Questions have been raised about Bolt, especially when he first emerged in Beijing. After all, athletes as tall as him are not supposed to run that fast, but the man himself is not bothered by such talk.
He is different, a speedster whose long levers allow him to cover the 100m in just 41 strides when others need a few steps more and a little more time.
And so, in under 30 seconds, or 132 steps, Bolt's career will be over. He will be out of sight, as he has been to his competitors for most of his career.
There will be no fooling around, no celebratory "To Da World," no electrifying nights under the floodlights.
It will never be the same again.  CNN

From forgotten World Cup to front page news
Vladimir Ninkovic has arrived early to discover that, just an hour before the scheduled start of play, most of his players are still asleep.
The general secretary of the Serbian Cricket Federation is standing in the middle of the Krnjaca Asylum Center, a few miles outside of the capital Belgrade, waiting to begin what has become a regular match for him and the Afghan and Pakistani refugees who live here.
Twice a week he comes to the camps, by public bus, often dressed in cricket whites, eliciting strange looks from his fellow commuters. At his feet is a bag stuffed full of batting pads, balls and a single box. The handle of a bat is poking out of the zip.
There are not many cricketers in Serbia, he says. And definitely not at this time of the morning.
Though there are several well-established clubs and a full national team, as well as youth teams, cricket is not wildly popular in Serbia.
But in 2014 something changed. It became a key transit point on the Western Balkans refugee route in to Europe. Tens of thousands of Iraqis, Syrians and Afghans passed through here, heading for the Hungarian or Croatian border, hoping to get to Germany or Austria.
When those routes were closed last year, thousands were effectively stuck in Serbia - unable to go home, and unable to get past the newly erected fences on the Hungarian border.
The vast majority left were young men and boys from Afghanistan and Pakistan. And the game of choice to pass the time in the refugee camps was cricket.
Enter Vlada, and the Serbian Cricket Federation, which in 2015 was given associate membership by the International Cricket Council.
The Serbian commissariat for refugees recognised that a strange game they barely understood appeared to be doing some good. After a few phone calls, they found Vlada and asked him to organise some matches.
We have about 10,000 refugees in 17 camps across the country, says 35-year-old Vlada, who began coming to the camps in April. During these two hours, twice a week, it gives them a few hours where they dont think of themselves as refugees or migrants or inmates, just good cricketers, he says. They are extremely passionate and enthusiastic about the game. And they have quality. Id say 70% of these players could play club-level cricket in England.
About 800 refugees live here, in tidy, well-kept lines of barracks that once hosted Croatian and Kosovan refugees from the Yugoslav Wars.
One Afghan player who plays for Vladas Mirijevo club is Noor Ahmad Sherzad.
I used to have a job as a police officer in the anti-narcotics department, the 32-year-old says of his life in Afghanistan. We had a lot of problems with smugglers from the Taliban side. They called me and threatened me, so I left.
Sherzad is one of the few refugees here who has claimed asylum in Serbia. Serbia is a transit country, explains Vlada. Less than 1% want to stay.. For Sherzad, there were few options.
When I was in Afghanistan I played for my police team in the academy, he says. When I got here, after three months I told my lawyer: I like to play cricket. And he called Vlada. I went to training. I am happy, I am alive and have friends, a small job and a cricket team.
About 30 young men and boys have now gathered around Vlada as he organises the teams. It is a half-hour journey on two public buses to Belgrades cricket pitch. Many are unaccompanied children, which means their official guardian - a social worker - has to accompany them to the game.
They are crazy for cricket. It is like with basketball in Serbia, says Miroslav Budimir, who is responsible for 40 boys, some as young as 10.
Many have had horrific experiences at the hands of people traffickers and various different border guards. Many have been beaten severely or jailed for long periods. Sometimes, the frustrations boil over in the camps. There was a riot involving 100 refugees in the camp the previous week.
They are isolated form the rest of the population and sometimes it gets tense here, he says. We had some fights, some unpleasant situations. But cricket is the best way to just release the pressure.
Belgrades single pitch can be found next to a small airstrip, near the Padinska Skela prison. A grey, concrete factory dominates one side.
Other members of the Serbian Cricket Federation are here, setting up a mobile scoreboard before handing out fresh fruit and water to the players. Kings XI will take on RCB.
These are good people who respect the refugee, says Prince, a young Afghan refugee in his mid-20s who will captain the RCB team. He fled his country after his brother joined the military. The Taliban threatened his family, he says, so his brother insisted he leave. Prince travelled most of the 5,000 miles by foot.
I was in a closed camp for seven months in Hungary. It was like a jail. It was very bad. They do not treat you like a human; they treat you like an animal, he recalls. But we are so happy in this country. Inshallah, we are playing cricket in Serbia. Im so happy.
Vlada walks the two captains out to the wicket and flips a five dinar coin. Princes RCB team win the toss and bat first, setting a challenging 141-8 in a match reduced to 15 overs thanks to the intense Balkan summer heat. Sixes are sprayed around, the ball sometimes disappearing for long periods when it lands in tall grass past long-on.
Vlada is the umpire, holding his hardback scorebook and meticulously noting every run, wide and no-ball. Occasionally there are heated arguments between players over the speed of play or overly aggressive bowling. But Kings XI chase down the target to win by four wickets.
A few days later, Vlada is back in the camps. This time he takes a bus to the Obrenovac camp. He arrives with plastic wickets to set up regular tape-ball cricket tournaments. This is the bigger of the two camps. About 1,000 young men and boys live here and roughly 100 come out to watch the tournament, won by the Afghan Champions, beating the Afghan Eagles off the last ball.
As ever, Vlada notes each run and ball in his hardback book. The underdog won - the Afghan Champions won by one wicket, he says, reading from his book of statistics.
Serbias refugees are not going anywhere soon. Many are now talking about staying. For Vlada, that could mean a sudden influx of talented players in to Serbian cricket.
We heard from the camps that young guys are now thinking about Serbia as an option, which previously wasnt happening, he says, before leaving the Obrenovac camp with his bag full of bats and balls, taking the next bus back to the city. Once the summer passes and the cold weather settles in, maybe they will change their minds. - BBC

Good Governance proved
There have been mixed views over the resignation of Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake on Thursday (10); some have called it a clear sign of good governance while others have been less enthusiastic. The Daily News thus interviewed a cross section of civil society who both supported as well as opposed Yahapalanaya to find out if they thought the government did well or poorly in this test of Good Governance.
Excerpts follow:
Gamini Viyangoda- Convener of Purawesi Balaya-(Citizens Power)
I think its a good precedent because normally our politicians, even if they are exposed before the people over certain corruptions and other things, they never resign.
The only other person I can remember is Tilak Marapana, who resigned some years back over certain statements that he made in the Parliament regarding protecting the owner of Avant Garde, so this is the second time. I think Ravi has addressed a moral question here.
There are two aspects to this issue; one is the legal aspect, the other is the moral aspect. So the legal aspect has to take its own course, which might take a long time to see whether Ravi is wrong or right.
Thats its own thing. But apart from that, being a politician, he has to be morally accountable for what he does. So that is why theres an issue with getting eight months rent from a person who is supposed to be one of the major accused in a major scandal in this country. So Ravi has taken the correct decision to step down. And this gives a good lesson to other politicians as well.
Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu - Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives
For a start, I dont think it couldve happened under the previous government. It shows that the commitment to accountability is still alive. Still, more needs to be done. One single individual is a start, perhaps. This governments commitment to accountability will be demonstrated and fulfilled when all of these suspicions are brought out into the open.
However, the Former Minister has not been indicted yet and the justice process should play out in full. I think he did the right thing, he did what was needed.
Seetha Ranjani - Poet, Social activist and former Convener of the Free Media Movement
I see Ravi Karunanayakas resignation as something good that happened under the new government. It should have happened and not just him, but whoever has serious allegations to their name should have investigations carried out.
It is a good precedence to have the person accused step down from his post until investigations prove otherwise. At the same time, we also should question what happened to all the large scale corruption cases which were spoken of when the new government was elected to office. It was a main demand of civil society and the people that corruption of the previous regime be investigated into, but no action has been taken over those cases so far and the people have become disappointed with the government for that.
In the past, it would be unimaginable to have a minister resign, but we now have a new political culture.
And since we have a unity government, we also seem to have a strong opposition which a country always needs.
Thus, the wrongdoings of a government can be uncovered during their own tenure and action can be taken.
In the past, there wasnt a strong opposition and the environment was undemocratic and the government actively persecuted those who went against the government, especially media personnel, but that environment has been changed and the people have the freedom to speak so we are now able expose corruption, this is a good situation.
I ask that the government now take steps to expose the corruption of the previous regime and take action against those responsible.
Visakha Tillekeratne -Womens Rights Activist and Co-convener of Citizens for a Secure Sri Lanka
The whole bond case has been investigated in a very messy manner and every day we see more and more players coming out.
There seems to be a lack of transparency and there are mixed opinions, so no one can get a footing on what is really happening.
I see the resignation of Ravi Karunanayake as a huge bluff because though he says he is not guilty and is doing it for the sake of good governance, he doesnt say that he wants his name cleared, it is as if someone who has been caught out is leaving.
To be fair by Ravi, we didnt see a transparent mechanism investigating into the allegations that went on within the government or the UNP and the investigations are yet to be complete, but we saw the minister simply resign.
Why did he step out prematurely Perhaps there maybe many more people involved and only Ravi has stepped out
Ven. Dr. Dambara Amila Thera - Head of History and Archaeology Department at the Sri Jayewardenepura University
This case has proven and practically made use of the two main fundamentals of good governance; which is democracy and transparency. It is for this that we fought for on January 8 and August 17, 2015. When you take this incident into account, it was a case where democracy received its due position. For example, the government Attorney Generals (AG) Department usually stands on behalf of the government but the Additional Solicitor General and state counsels that came with him, questioned a government minister in a manner which proved that they had the complete freedom to do their job and they were not constrained in any way to not do their duty because it was a government minister. We didnt see that happen before, earlier the AG department didnt even look at a file of a government minister because they were so scared - the AG department was completely broken down then.
But today, we see that regardless of the fact that this was a prominent minister, one of the main people who worked to bring in good governance, Deputy Chairman of the UNP, former Finance and current Foreign Minister, the AG Department was allowed to ask any question they wanted.
He (Additional Solicitor General) was so aggressive that even the commissioners warned him and asked him to calm down, this shows that democracy has its due place today. Media is also free and can report on whatever they like with no dangerous consequences.
The commission was appointed to investigate into the Treasury Bond issue, but Ravi Karunanayakas issue came up regarding another matter; during evidence of another witness. His connection with Arjun Aloysius and how he paid his rent and all came out. They still havent found out if there was a fraud or not in the Bond issue, but Ravi admitted that since there has been a connection established between himself and the main suspect in the case, he would allow the investigation to continue without interference by him and his position as a minister and so he resigns. That shows transparency in the government.
More than Ravi Karunanayake resigning as an individual, him resigning from his post has great bearing and stops his ministerial power from impacting the investigations.
So this is a great encouragement for all those who fought to bring in good governance and who believed that we needed it and the support Ravi Karunanayake has shown, has further strengthened good governance. It is surprising for Sri Lanka and unbelievable and yet, Ravi Karunanayake took that historic step.
Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka - Political Analyst and former diplomat
Im very pleased and proud in the way that the commission has functioned. I do admit, under the previous administration, a commission of this sort would not have functioned with the independence that this has functioned. But, in their defence, members of the former Rajapaksa government say that such a scandal never happened on their watch.
I dont think its a symbol of good governance to have a massive fraud, as the bond scam, and then, because of public opinion and pressure, to have an inquiry, and then the man who was named resigns.
This is the tip of the iceberg.
JC Weliamuna -Human Rights Lawyer and Executive Director of Transparency International Sri Lanka
This is quite a transparent inquiry. These allegations came to the public very openly. And the minister and various others may be implicated, seriously. I think the first time a witness came out with this evidence of giving some kind of a gift - this is actually within the meaning of corruption. And this requires further criminal investigation. But I think this resignation is a good move.
It really shows that, unlike previously, governance structure is now working. You cant stop corruption, but at least corruption investigations are underway, and the politicians are now slowly learning to respond. And the second thing is, Im quite happy that somebody from the Attorney Generals Department, which is also part of the public sector, is capable of questioning a sitting minister just like an ordinary citizen. And finally, unfortunately, in the parliament there were a lot of unnecessary or unfair attacks on the Attorney Generals Department and the Additional Solicitor General.
I dont think that is acceptable, because the politicians should also realize that the Attorney Generals Department also has a role to play. So they have done their job, and they must be respected for that.
So I hope, that the Attorney Generals Department will have more and more recruits so that there will be no shortage of lawyers for the prosecution, so that other pending matters, which have been pending for a long time in the department, will also be dealt with quickly. And the Attorney Generals role must be appreciated by the civil society. And also, it shows the independence of our judges, which was not the case before.
So all in all, I think its a good sign for good governance.
Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon - Executive Director of Campaign for Free and Fair Elections
I dont think its a sign of good governance, I think its the other way around. Now, this commission is all about the Treasury Bond issue and we should not forget that. In the middle of this commission, Ravi Karunanayakes name was mentioned and there was an allegation made against Karunanayake, and based on that he was pressured by various groups, political class and civil society, to resign. And that resignation finally happened.
But, the main issue is still the same. We are pressuring the government to investigate the Treasury bond issue, which should be a criminal investigation. When we were demanding this two years ago, there was less evidence than this. Now in front of the commission, various forms of evidence were exposed.
The criminal proceedings in relation to this have to come out. Until that criminal justice inquiry is finished, we cannot say it [this resignation] is a part of good governance. We salute that due to pressure, Ravi Karunanayake resigned. Its a good sign. But the main issue lies the same. Why not other ministers People must be questioned. We can only find the truth when other ministers are questioned on the same issues like they questioned Ravi Karunanayake. The big picture wont appear to us until others are questioned.
This Ravi issue is just a small piece of an onion. But we are talking about a field of onions.
What we are talking about is the Treasury bond issue, not just a house rented by Ravi Karunanayake. Good that Ravi resigned based on that small part, but the question really is, 'Who are the culprits of the treasury bond issue, the masterminds who benefited from that And how can the country get the money back' Unless we manage to get the money back, this issue wont be solved. Get the peoples money back.

Guliyev wrecks van Niekerk double hopes
London: Wayde van Niekerk's dreams of emulating legend Michael Johnson's 200m/400m world double lay in tatters on Thursday as Turkey's 9/1 outsider Ramil Guliyev edged the 200m final.
Guliyev's win may not have been following the script the organisers wished for after two-time doping cheat Justin Gatlin's win in the 100m upset superstar Usain Bolt's farewell.
Normal order was restored, however, in the night's other two finals with the United States going one-two in both.
Christian Taylor won his third world title in the triple jump with his great rival Will Claye taking silver just as he has done in two successive Olympic Games.
However, Olympic 400m hurdles champion Dalilah Muhammad was unable to add the world gold as she was run out of first by compatriot Kori Carter, the 25-year-old previously regarded as a journeywoman. Van Niekerk, who had won the 400m earlier in the week, took a swipe at people who he feels have belittled his achievements. "There are many people who don't think I deserve this," said the 25-year-old, who produced the performance of the Olympics last year breaking the 400m world record in winning gold.
"I work just as hard as every other competitor. I don't think I got the respect I deserved after the 400m (winning the world gold) but it's only the beginning and I will show my dominance." As Guliyev's win was confirmed after a thrilling finish to the 200m, some boos rang out and thousands of spectators couldn't make the exit quickly enough.
The 27-year-old Azerbaijan-born sprinter, who became a Turkish citizen in 2011, then draped himself in both the Turkish and Azeri flags as he performed his lap of honour. "It's not a shock. I wanted to win and this year I thought it was possible and I made it," said Guliyev. "Yes I believed in myself." Taylor won well enough but the threatened assault on Jonathan Edwards's 22-year-old world record never materialised. He did show his champion's mentality in twice coming back to better Claye's marks and leave his 26-year-old rival to add another silver to his ever growing collection in his trophy cabinet.
"Will makes it tough every single time," said 27-year-old Taylor who added he will move up to the 400m only when he breaks the world record and has a permanent reminder of the 18.30m he needs to do so...on his wrist.

Lanka battle to avoid whitewash
Batting legend Aravinda de Silva gives pep talk to boost flagging morale:
PALLEKELE: Sri Lanka battling hard with injuries and up against an inform Indian team with the possibility of being whitewashed 3-0 in the three-match Test series got a morale boost ahead of the third and final cricket Test starting at Pallekele International Stadium today from former Sri Lanka legend Aravinda de Silva.
De Silva had a pep talk with the players and according to skipper Dinesh Chandimal its had a positive effect on the team.
Aravinda is a legend and you know, he is one of the greatest batsman that Sri Lanka has ever produced. We had a chat with him three days ago. After that players look really confident, said Chandimal.
I hope the players use that advice and continue their performance in the game. It's always about the confidence. Not to worry about the past and poor performances.
De Silva spoke to the players at a strategic session arranged by Sri Lanka Cricket on Monday.
That's a very important meeting. All the players were there at the meeting and we discussed how we could take our game forward and lift it. How we're going to win games, said Chandimal.
It's a good thing and all the players also contributed to that. Lot of positives came out. At the end of the meeting, all the players were in a bit of an upbeat mood and that looks really good. I thank SLC for having a meeting of that nature and bringing a legend like Aravinda de Silva to motivate us.
As captain Chandimal faces a big challenge to uplift the morale of his team who has suffered heavy losses in the first two Tests being beaten inside four days on each occasion.
It's a difficult task but the real captain has to stay with the team at difficult moments, said Chandimal. It's a big challenge for the whole team but if one or two youngsters can come out and shine to a level that we can win this game, it's a great moral booster to the whole team. We mustn't forget the fact that we're up against the world's number one team. We're waiting to pick that win.
The series is not yet over. As a captain, I don't like to lose. Whether its the world's number one team or number eight team I want to win. We're putting our full effort to do that but we cannot control the ultimate result.
With fast bowler Nuwan Pradeep out of contention with a hamstring injury Chandimal hinted at Lahiru Kumar and uncapped Vishwa Fernando getting the nod.
Lahiru and Vishwa are bowling well these days. As the two senior bowlers are not in contention, its a good opportunity for them to put up their hands and make a contribution. I hope the two will grab the opportunity, said Chandimal.
Rain has been prevalent throughout the past few days and it is expected to cause interruptions to the Test. Both teams forewent practice yesterday because of rain. We did practice yesterday (Thursday) at the Indoor nets but certain batsmen are not all that happy batting at indoor nets. We were to practice in the morning but it rained and we lost the opportunity. However, the trainers gave us some exercises and we did them, said Chandimal. On the other hand, we thought it's good to come for tomorrow's game with a bit of a rest to the mind.
[Aravindas 10 Commandments to our cricketers]
Some key points that Aravinda de Silva got across to the Sri Lanka cricketers:
lPlay fearless cricket which is the Sri Lankan style
lDo not worry about failure, selectors must believe in the players and give them a decent run
lDont worry about the selectors and of being dropped they believe in you thats why they have picked you
lLearn through you mistakes everybody makes mistakes, experience is all about making mistakes and learning
lDont worry about criticism on social media, facebook, twitter just go out there and do what is best for you
lWhen under pressure take your mind off and do things that make you happy and comfortable dont think about cricket all the time, but relax and enjoy life
lAs youngsters players are also adults  coaches and administrators need not treat them like children
lThey have to accept that they are adults and know their responsibilities if you lose a match you dont have to run 10 rounds or do practice as punishment
lCricket is 90 percent mind game and fitness those are the two things you have to focus on
lPlayers need support from spectators, selectors and everyone, they should get together and support them and back their ability plus their talent.

Moves to remove barriers for local tourists:
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha berated action by local entrepreneurs to reserve Foreigners only beach resorts.
The minister made this remark at a meeting with the top entrepreneurs of the tourism industry recently. Various local entrepreneurs engaged in the hospitality industry in the Southern coastal area have put up Foreigners Only boards on their beach resorts and have ignored local tourists.
Each citizen has the right to visit any part of the country.
No one has the authority to take away that right," the minister said.
The local authorities will take steps to prevent such incidents in the future. Tourism is one of the biggest income earners for the country and provides a large number of jobs for the people. We should protect the industry," he said.
Minister Musthapha requested Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva to take steps to minimise difficulties experienced by local tourists in holiday resorts in the region.
He instructed the officials to initiate a programme in liaison with the tourism ministry to control the situation.

"We can be happy about the Presidents decision to appoint a sub-committee to determine what has happened to narcotics taken into custody from raids recently," he said.

Palisena was testifying before the PCoI for the third consecutive day.
When Palisena testified before the PCoI on August 9, 2017, he expressed his confidence in the ability of settling the transaction if all his bids were accepted on the 27 February 2015. Going back to his explanation, Palisena explained to the PCoI as to what factors prompted him to bid higher than what was advertised by the Central Bank.
Palisena told the main factors behind bidding higher than what was accepted, based on the large borrowing requirement of the government, the mini budget, rate adjustments, Tyral Gunatilakes telephone call promoting the 30-year treasury bond and the low amount of bid offering by the Central Bank.
On the hypothesis that all my bids were accepted, I was planning to settle the transaction using several methods. For once, I had Rs. 581 million worth bonds maturing that day. Then I had securities which could have been sold out up to Rs. 3 billion. Then I could have raised Rs. 3 billion or so by entering into sell and buy back agreement with the Bank of Ceylon. Then I would have to raise only 7.5 billion more. For that, I could have gone to trade with counter parties for it. The worst case scenario would be for me to go to CBSL OMO window. I can keep doing it until I attract repo traders to raise money by offering higher yields, Palisena explained. Commissioner Supreme Court Judge Justice Jayawardena then asked Palisena how he can be confident that he would have been able to settle the hypothetical 15 billion when PTL defaulted their Intraday Liquidity Facility on March 29, 2016. Palisena pointed out to the PCoI that it was oversight from his part that they were not able to settle the intraday liquidity facility.
We made an error when entering data to the system. When the PTL Back Office entered data, they have entered a chunk of Rs. 11 billion without breaking them down into two parts. It put us in a situation which we call a grid lock. It was not that we did not have money to settle the bids we sold with the promise of buying back. It is that we made a technical mistake, Palisena explained.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake pointed out to the PCoI that Palisena was referring to certain notes using his laptop. He told the PCoI that Palisena is narrating a pre arranged testimony and objected Palisena referring to the notes while testifying. DSG Gunatilake also requested a copy of the document that Palisena was referring to.
The PCoI told Palisena to refrain from referring to the pre arranged notes when testifying.
Palisena explained to the PCoI how the PTL Financial Analyst make predictions on auctions based on extensive research done by them on a daily basis. He referred to a series of auctions and bid decisions made by the PTL which were successful. He referred to bond auctions held in October 2015, March and April 2016. Palisena explained how his Financial Analyst made predictions based on both local and international economic conditions.
He once again established the manner in which the PTL buy rumours and sell news.
Palisena told that his company promoted Sri Lankas Treasury bond market at the Asia Finance, which was held in 2016 at Singapore. He also pointed out their promotion attracted foreign investors into the bond market.
Counsels for Perpetual Treasuries Limited Nihal Fernando PC and Romali Thudawe led evidence.
The PCoI issued a summoning to W.M. Mendis and Company yesterday morning. The PCoI has requested Arjun Aloysius to provide details of W.M. Mendis and Company. It was pointed out the company is a separate legal entity from the Perpetual Capital Holdings.
Free Lanka Group handed over details including its audited accounts to the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday morning.

Govt. repeals two legislations under Judicature Act
The Government yesterday, repealed the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Bill and Regulations under the Judicature Act.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament that the two pieces of legislation would be withdrawn.
The Bill to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act was presented on May 25, to make provisions to ensure the rights of an Attorney-at-Law who represents a person held in police custody.
Regulations under the Judicature Act states that all prosecutions, proceedings or matters in respect of offences under the Atomic Energy Act must be taken up only in the Colombo High Court.
Both legislations come under the purview of Justice Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.
Samurdhi allowance will not be slashed:SB
The Minister of Social Empowerment S B Dissanayake, assured that the Samurdhi allowance would not be slashed.
He made this observation yesterday, responding to a question raised by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena on Thursday, with regard to matters which drove the House into chaos on Thursday.
"The Government has decided to adopt a multi dimensional poverty survey to select Samurdhi recipients. Under this system, marks would be given to all potential recipients. Marks are given for the properties they own and the level of education of children. Accordingly, recipients who own less than 10 cows, 20 goats, 50 cockerels and who does not have appliances such as TVs and radios, would get more marks," the minister said. This he said, is a globally accepted system.
Deputy Minister Nimal Lansa said government should not create a mess with slashing the Samurdhi allowance.
He said the Samurdhi allowance of families which consist of a child who has passed the Ordinary Level Examination should not be cut.
Minister Dissanayake said the government would not cut the Samurdhi allowance of families who had a child who has passed the Ordinary Level Examination. He added that only one mark of the 100 would be cut if there was a child who has passed the O/L examination.
'Why were not former CB Governor and sister summoned before PCoI'
The UNP backbenchers yesterday, questioned as to why former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal or his sister Shiromi Wickremasinghe were not yet summoned before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry(PCoI) on the bond issue.
UNP MP Prof. Ashu Marasinghe speaking at the Parliamentary debate yesterday, pointed out that the PCoI would need the help of informed advisors as it has so far failed to summon the most relevant witnesses.
Cabraals sister Shiromi Wickremesinghe was a director at Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. The names of former CB Governor Cabraal and his sister have also been implicated in the Treasury bonds allegations.
UNP MP Nalin Bandara bolstering Marasinghes position, said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who was the Finance Minister when the PTL was set up, should also be summoned before the PCoI if former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake was summoned.
Those in the AG Department have not been able to verify the signature of the former Defence Minister for two long years.
How can we believe in their competency to handle these investigations A large number of files have been sent to the AG's Department after the completion of investigations. The AG's Department should expedite investigations into them, Prof Marasinghe charged.
We urge the Attorney Generals Department to do justice in their investigations. If not, they would fail to deliver what people expect from them, the MP added.

Post thoughts on Ravis resignation
The government did gain much by the way its declared commitment to fighting corruption, came with the resignation of Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake, with regard to serious issues raised about the renting of a Colombo residence, widely described as a Penthouse, when he was Minister of Finance.
The issue of his resignation, relating to alleged links to Perpetual Treasuries and thus to the Central Bank Bond Scam was certainly the subject of the political spotlight for the past week. It gathered intensity with his statements that he had not been asked to resign by the President. This response by him to media reports on the matter did make links with his own evidence at the Presidential Commission on the Central Bank Bond Scams, where he repeatedly claimed not to know anything about financial transactions by members of his family on his residence in Colombo. The issue soon became one of major political significance with the Joint Opposition (JO) handing over a No Confidence motion against him to the Speaker, and serious division within the government on support and opposition to the No Confidence move. With the media standing by their statements about the Presidents request for him to resign from office, as well as clear reports that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too had made such a call to him, there was little room for any major political manoeuvre by Ravi Karunanayake.
The situation was certainly getting hotter with all members of the SLFP in government stating they would support to No Confidence motion, and some members of the UNP too going on record being supportive of the motion. The drama finally moved to the Speaker, who said the Attorney General would be consulted on certain aspects of the motion that may have been sub judice, as it related to a matter before a Presidential Commission of Inquiry. This position too caused considerable criticism by some sections of the media, who asserted the position of Parliament above the Judiciary, especially referring the former Speaker Anura Bandaranaikes ruling on a similar matter.
Mr. Karunanayakes announcement in Parliament that he was resigning from the office of Foreign Minister, did bring considerable relief to the government, as the No Confidence motion laying before the House, whatever the legal aspects about it, was a major plus for the JO. All talk of delaying any decision until the Minister was found guilty of any offence, certainly did not hold water, both in the context of politics, as well as civil society and the wider public thinking on the matter. What is of importance here is not a matter of innocence or guilt. It is that of a public impression created by ones actions  or those by members of ones family -- that is not condemned or rejected by the person concerned, which creates more than a semblance of wrong doing, and does not stand proper scrutiny in the public mind.
Much substance
Minister Karunanayakes resignation certainly gives much substance to Prime Minister Wickremesinghes statement that the government would not tolerate corruption in any form, and that all allegations of corruption would be investigated and action would be taken. While the JO may have been pushed back to some extent, with a key government minister resigning on matters related to corruption, bringing out something that could never have happened, and could not even be dreamt of during the Rajapaksa regime; this also brings back the larger issue of the governments massive delay in fighting the corruption of the Rajapaksa years.
The publicity given to the major protest demonstration due to be held at Vihara Maha Devi Park on August 15, by the Puravesi Balaya and the National Movement for Just Society, which will be calling for governments speedy action against corruption and activity to bring a new constitution, will be a reminder to the government of the need to move ahead with the policies against corruption that were part of its campaign for the Presidential and General Elections in 2015. The Vihara Maha Devi protest will be two days before the second anniversary of the August 2015 General Election. While the Bond Scam probes are continuing, there are also the major issues of the delayed action (if there is any action) against the fraud and corruption of the Rajapaksa Regime. The Ravi Karunanayake resignation, while helping to draw a veil over the failure to act against the corruption of the previous regime, certainly does not hide the problems caused by these delays. This brings into new focus the statement made almost three months ago by the President himself of delays in the probes into corruption of the former regime.
What we now see is a revival of the debate on fighting corruption. The JO did have a major push on the Ravi Karunanayake issue. But it must be made to understand that it has to face a great deal of exposure in the fight against corruption. The government will certainly have to meet the calls for a faster judicial process in this matter, speedy action by the several institutions involved, which includes the Attorney Generals Dept., and the need to bring before Courts the many names of the former regimes about whom the public were told much, but with little action against so far.
Election delays
The government is certainly acting pleased with its plans to postpone the Provincial Council Elections due in the next two months, with the move to change the electoral laws to hold all Provincial Council elections in one day. The saving to the national exchequer by this move is certainly interesting. Similarly, it also reduces the chances of province focused electoral fraud, which was part of the reality. However, it is certainly facing a major accusation of being anti-democratic, with the PC Polls postponement coming with the huge delay in the Local Government Polls. The new change in electoral laws will certainly have to be approved by the Supreme Court. Or else, the government may even have to face a referendum on the matter. This is hardly the stuff that a government fearful of a referendum on a new constitution could readily accept.
Also, the saving on the PC Polls being held on one day, while correct, is not in sync when the government has to come to Parliament to raise 70.5 million rupees to meet the cost of foreign travel by some ministries and departments in a single month. There is the need for the government to rein in its expenses on foreign travel, as well as other official expenditure, if the public is to believe in its claims of good governance and service to the public.
China Port
The government certainly has a new opponent within its ranks with the Minister of Justice and Buddha Sasana Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe telling the Sinhala media that he is opposed to the sale of the public asset of the Hambantota Port to the Chinese, and that whether in the government or without, he would not rest until he regains its ownership on behalf of the people. Is this a sign of a new trend within the UNP, with those who have come there from outside, now thinking of going back to the political buddies of the past, who have similar thinking on the long term lease of the Hambantota Port to China
2020 Polls
The situation within the JO and its leadership strategies are making interesting moves to keep the Rajapaksa name active on one side, while there are members from within it who are thinking of other leadership possibilities, too. There is a group that is increasing in numbers who see in Dinesh Gunawardena a likely leader in the 2020 Presidential Poll, considering his long service in parliament and his political background with his father being the late Philip Gunewardena, the leftist leader and later a major leader of the Sinhalese, who brought about the MEP with the late SWRD Bandaranaike. He does have problems with the minority voters, but those within the JO who believe that the Sinhala vote will be the deciding factor see in him a good leader, who does not have the disadvantages of the Rajapaksas.
However, the Rajapaksas are not to be left out. The strategy on that side of the JO is to run the non-politician Rajapaksa  Gotabhaya  as the next presidential candidate with the image of his leadership given to the forces as the Secretary of Defence, under his brother Mahinda. This is interesting as the strategists on this line think this will give an opportunity for Mahinda, who cannot run for another term as president, to still control the office of president with his brother being there. Would Gotabhaya be ready to be a puppet Rajapaksa These rival strategies will be getting hotter after the government completes the second year in office, later this month. But, the Rajapaksa strategy will remain with concerns about the anti-corruption strategies of the government in the coming months.

President keen to stamp out corruption - Bandara
The country can be built as long as there are leaders who take prompt action against fraud and corruption, Sri Lanka Freedom Party Youth Front (SLFPYF) Chairman, Shantha Bandara said yesterday.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said President Maithripala Sirisena who is committed to eliminating fraud and corruption as pledged to the people in 2015.
He took the most suitable action at the correct time.With this incident, others will also be reluctant to engage in fraud and corruption in the future,Bandara said.
This is the beginning of a new clean political culture.We will further extend our fullest support to the President in his endeavours to lead the country in a genuine political journey.We also request the President to take bold decisions to move this country forward, he added.
Although the Opposition members initially described the appointment of a Presidential Commission as an attempt to cover up bond scam, they have now realised that it is not so.
Since the investigation into the bond issue is yet to be completed, we will get to know more information about the people who have cheated the country in the future, he said.
The SLFP is becoming a strong and people's friendly political party overcoming setbacks under the present leadership who has the capacity to meet challenges. Therefore, we request all who are estranged from the SLFP to join hands with the party without destroying their future political careers, he said.

Puttur protest demands removal of cemeteries from villages
JAFFNA: Over 1,000 people protested in front of the Puttur Pradeshya Sabha in Jaffna calling for the removal of cemeteries next to peoples homes yesterday.
The protest in which a large number of women and youngsters participated, follows the 31 day-long Satyagragha protest in Kalaimathi village in Puttur.Sivakolunthu, 63, has been living next to the cemetery in Kalaimathi for 11 years. The cemetery causes a lot of problems, and even dogs run around with half burnt body parts, she said. There are other cemeteries close by that can be used instead, she added.Vaagini aged 25, is the first university graduate from Kalaimathi village living close to the cemetery. She said pregnant mothers, old people and young children are badly affected.Vaagini, her father along with many other villagers, were arrested by police, following tensions that led to the destruction of the cemetery wall by the villagers.
Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray visited Kalaimathi few weeks back and met the villagers. But only one of the Provincial Councilors, S.Sivajilingam, has visited the village so far, according to the protestors.
On Wednesday, Thanikasalam, a senior community leader, along with others had met with the Governor and later that day with Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran. We explained the cemetery problem in detail to the officials. The Governor said, the Pradeshaya Sabha and Provincial Council, are ultimately responsible to address this problem, Thanikasalam added.
The Chief Minister had told the villagers that he will talk to all sides before coming up with a solution. Fridays protests also drew people from other villages with homes next to cemeteries. Chithra from Urumpirai said there is a similar cemetery problem in her village. Officials gave us deeds and even housing schemes next to these cemeteries, but the location is proving a major problem in the day to day lives of the people, she said, adding that they are protesting for the future of their children. She said, not only Kalaimathi village, but also many other villages in Jaffna, such as Yogapuram, Selvapuram, Paalpannai and Thidatpulam have cemetery problems.
Navasheelan, aged 33, from Punnalaikuttuvan, where a similar cemetery problem exists in Thidatpulam village, said this is an issue concerning social justice.
He said, that caste oppression is at the root of this problem, and they are trying to keep working people at the bottom and next to cemeteries. This is a struggle for our rights, as our bodies are physically affected and we suffer psychologically.
One of the protest organisers Rajasekaram from Kalaimathi said protests will continue until the cemeteries are removed and the villagers in custody are released.
The protest sought to draw the attention of authorities in the Puttur Pradeshya Sabha, even as 23 people from Kalaimathi village are in remand custody for over a month. The central demand of the protest is that the Northern Provincial Council should remove cemeteries near peoples settlements.

Redefining the term animal welfare
Last week, a public interest litigation was filed in the Supreme Court seeking an interim order, directing the Inspector General of Police and relevant authorities to take immediate measures to prevent the killing, murder, maiming, abusing or other cruelty against dogs and cats.
The petitioners stated that there has been an exponential, proliferation of the killing of dogs, within state institutions, public property, streets and other public places, which has reached alarming and chilling proportions, and which has resulted in a concerted public outcry and public outburst against such unmitigated brutality. This incident brought into focus, once again, the rights and welfare of animals in Sri Lanka.
Ahimsa
In our 2300-year old culture, animals always had a respect and a special place in society. The foundation of our two major religions was Ahimsa or non-violence, not only towards fellow humans and animals, but also to every living creature including an insect.
With such rich culture and heritage, compassion was the foundation of society and there was no need for animal welfare organisations. Each home was an animal welfare institution by itself. Most homes had cattle in the backyard, bullocks working in the fields, cows and buffaloes providing milk. Dogs and cats lived inside the homes as members of the family. It was a beautiful picture of co-existence of animals and humans. But today times have changed. With population explosion, urbanization and consumerism catching up, animals have become easy prey for human greed. The Western world is still trying to distinguish between good and bad standards of animal welfare. However, there is no common ground for acceptance. It varies considerably between different countries.
For example, the world organisation for animal health or OIE (Office International des Epizooties) define animal welfare as how an animal is coping with the conditions in which it lives. The organisation has put forward five freedoms to describe the right to welfare of animals under human control. They are freedom from hunger, freedom from malnutrition and thirst, freedom from fear and distress, freedom from physical and thermal discomfort, freedom from pain, injury and disease and freedom to express normal patterns of behaviour.
The OIE considers that animal welfare standards should be based on sound science and standards should focus on the results achieved for the animal and they should always seek to maintain health as a basis of welfare.
The European Commission also has been promoting their concept of animal welfare for many decades. Twenty years ago, they took an important step by issuing a Council Directive on the protection of animals kept for farming purposes. The Directive gave general rules for the protection of animals of all species used for the production of food, wool, skin or fur or for other farming purposes.
These rules were based on the (TFEU) - Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Article 13 of TFEU provides that in formulating and implementing the Unions agriculture, fisheries, transport, internal market, research and technological development, the Member States shall, since animals are sentient beings, pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals.
India
Now, let us turn to our neighbour - India. In 1960, India introduced its first national animal welfare law, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, criminalizing cruelty to animals. However, exceptions were made for the treatment of animals used for food and scientific experiments. The 1960 law also created the Animal Welfare Board of India to ensure the anti-cruelty provisions were enforced and promote the cause of animal welfare.
Subsequent laws have placed regulations and restrictions on the use of draught animals, the use of performing animals, animal transport, animal slaughter, and animal experimentation.
A 2006 amendment specifies that experimenters must first try to use animals lowest on the phylogenetic scale, use the minimum number of animals for 95% statistical confidence, and justify not using non-animal alternatives. A 2013 amendment bans the use of live animal experiments in medical education. In 2014 India became the first country in Asia to ban all testing of cosmetics on animals and the import of cosmetics tested on animals.
Today, India has a grade of C out of possible grades A, B, C, D, E, F, G on Global Animal Protection Index. The Animal Protection Index ranks countries on their commitment to protect animals in their legislation, improve animal welfare and recognise animal sentience. Sri Lanka is not yet listed for evaluation.
Malaysia
Its also worth to look at the Malaysian experience. On July 18, 2017, Animal Welfare Act has come into force in Malaysia, which marked the highest goal for animal welfare in Malaysia.
The Act tightens regulations on activities involving animals, and theres a Animal Welfare Board set up to enforce the Act. This Board has a long list of functions, from promoting awareness on animal welfare to advising the relevant Ministers on matters pertaining to animal welfare.
The new Act amends the two previous Acts  1953 and 2013, rather, it expands on the welfare of animals in greater scope. Number of positive steps have been brought in.
1. All individuals and businesses who handle animals for a living need to apply for a license from the Animal Welfare Board. This does not apply to pet owners, but applies to businesses like pet shops, animal shelters, and more of the like. The penalty for not having a license ranges from RM15,000 to RM75,000.
2. Pet owners and license holders will be required to take care of each of their animals needs such as: (1) Take reasonable steps to ensure that the needs of an animal are fulfilled, which includes (i) its need for a suitable environment; (ii) its need for a suitable diet; (iii) the need for it to be able to exhibit its normal behaviour patterns; (iv) the need for it to be housed with or apart from other animals; and (v) the need for it to be protected from pain, suffering, injury and disease;
(2) Pet owners found guilty of any offence under the Act can have their pets taken away, and be barred from handling animals for up to one year; license holders may be barred from holding a license for up to five years as well as be barred from owning personal pets for up to one year.
(3) All research, testing, and teaching using animals must be done with a special license. In addition to the duties from point number (1) imposed by the license, the animals must be well taken care of. Even where pain or suffering cannot be avoided, it must be minimized or the testers will face consequences. Offenders will be liable to a fine of between RM20,000 to RM100,000 and/or be jailed for three years.
4. Animal Welfare Officers are authorised to search a suspects house for evidence of animal abuse without a warrant. They normally require a warrant under the Criminal Procedure Code, but can bypass this if they think there's a chance that evidence will be tampered with, removed, or destroyed while waiting for a warrant to be issued.
5. The definition of animal cruelty in Malaysian law has expanded in scope. This includes mutilation, neglect, use of cruel equipment, shooting for sport, and animal fights etc. Offenders under this Section are liable to between RM20,000 and RM100,000 in fines and/or three years of imprisonment. The putting down of animals has also been regulated by the new law. (One RM equals to about Rs. 35.90, if you want to calculate in local currency).
Sri Lanka
As we turn our attention to Sri Lanka, we can notice how much we are lagging way behind the other countries regarding animal welfare. We just have a severely out-dated ordinance  Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance, which is 110 years old. We also have an amendment done in 1955 which is applicable only to domesticated animals not for others found in urban wild life. For a long time, civil society organisations working on animal welfare have pointed out the need for passing the new Animal Welfare Bill replacing the out-of-date ordinance. They also have recommended the establishment of a National Animal Welfare Authority and a Code of Practice and to raise awareness on animal welfare. In 2006, the Law Commission, with the support of the interested parties, drafted an Animal Welfare Bill (including the formation of a National Animal Welfare Authority) and forwarded it to then President. The Bill too got stuck in the legislative pipeline and didnt see the light during his tenure. In 2015, the new Government brought forth this Bill under its 100-day programme, and in 2016, it was approved by the Cabinet.
It is imperative that the Government table the Bill at the Parliament at an early date to ensure effective and efficient laws on cruelty to animals are in place in Sri Lanka in keeping with the global trend. And, also taking the cue from India, the Government can consider giving the due rights to animals in the new Constitution they are presently drafting.

Report outlines problems facing sustainability of Sigiriya Rock Fortress
A new report published online yesterday, outlined the problems facing the sustainability of the Sigiriya Rock Fortress, a UNESCO world heritage site and a popular tourist attraction in the Central Province.
According to a report prepared for the Prime Ministers Office by a team appointed to examine the over-crowding at the Sigiriya World Heritage site, these problems include the overcrowding and tourism, lack of affordable overnight options for local visitors, wasp attacks and degradation and weathering of the rock itself and the paintings on it.
In suggesting potential solutions, the report included proposals for renovating the land extent to the east of the Sigiriya Rock, prior to entry into the Water Garden Precinct; an implementation of a crowd management policy, with appropriate visitor facilities which would function as crowd-holding areas; better hotel accommodations within the designated tourist zones which do not hinder the Rocks landscape, as well as affordable accommodations for the local tourist population and the adoption of measures to limit access to the fresco rock pocket only for serious researchers, in order to save the original paintings from destruction.
Though there had been suggestions to attempt to eliminate the wasps, due to the possibility of attack on the Rock, the report has stressed that this would not be smart. This would be a disaster as they (the wasps) would return as their generations have done for centuries to build hives on the cooler under surface of the rock the next season. But this time following the theory of evolution, they would be prepared for any human intervention.

Several Govt. backbenchers complain about two AGs Dept. officials to PM
Several government backbenchers met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday to complain against the actions of two senior officials of the Attorney Generals Department working for the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the Treasury Bond issue. The MPs had elaborated on overall actions taken by the Attorney Generals Department and had in detail pointed out to certain misgivings and practices of the two senior officers.
The discussions between the ruling party MPs and the Prime Minister took place at the Parliament Complex.
Furthermore, they submitted a letter to the Prime Ministers office yesterday (11) asking that the Prime Minister reveal the governments stance with regard to these two senior officers.
During their discussions, the MPs had presented documents to the PM showing that one of the senior officers was drawing a salary at the Department while also being paid another salary as consultancy fees to the Central Bank during the tenure of the previous regime.
They also informed the Prime Minister that this officer tried to use his influence in the AGs Department to suppress evidence in a rape case in an organised manner.
The other senior official they say had acted in a suspicious manner in the case connected to the Tsunami money fraud.

Udayanga represented by a lawyer; requests to recall warrant
The Defence Counsel who appeared on behalf of former Ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga yesterday requested to recall the arrest warrant issued against him through the INTERPOL over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF).
Presidents Counsel Anil Silva appearing on behalf of Udayanga Weeratunga further moved that the Fort Magistrates order to impound two passports belonging to his client be suspended.
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne announced that she would deliver an appropriate order in this regard on August 21.
On June 30, the Colombo Fort Magistrate ordered to impound two passports belonging to former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga in the magisterial inquiry pertaining to the controversial MiG aircraft transaction.
Accordingly, a diplomatic passport bearing number D 3643585 and a general passport bearing number N 5400885 issued by the Sri Lankan government to Udayanga Weeratunga were ordered to be impounded by Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne in accordance with Section 124 of the Criminal Procedure Code and Section 51 C of the Immigrants and Emigrants Act.
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne had earlier issued a warrant through INTERPOL for the arrest of former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA).
Anil Silva PC submitted to Court that issuing of warrant against his client and impounding his passports had not been done in accordance with the law. He further said Weeratunga has been in Ukraine for nearly three decades.
The Financial Crimes Investigations Division(FCID) conducting investigations into the controversial MiG aircraft transaction informed Court that they have sought the assistance of Interpol to trace former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga who is currently living in United Arab Emirates (UAE).
The FCID informed Court that they were yet to ascertain Udayangas exact address in UAE and further said he has visited multiple countries including Japan using passports issued by Sri Lankan government.
The FCID conducting investigations into the MiG aircraft transaction had named Udayanga Weeratunga as a suspect in the case through a B report dated October 11, 2016. The FCID sought a warrant written in English through the Interpol from the Fort Magistrates Court to arrest former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA). The FCID told Court that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was unable to serve notices on Udayanga Weeratunga who has been residing in Ukraine for several years.
The FCID had informed Court that Weeratunga had directly intervened into the questionable transaction in procuring MiG-27 ground attack craft. The FCID said the deal amounted to US$14 million. On June 9, 2016, the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued notices on Weeratunga to appear in Court July 15 but he did not turn up.The FCID had told Court that they were investigating whether the former Sri Lankan ambassador in Russia had invested money in a company called Sri Lankan Limited Liability Company in Moscow, which were allegedly earned through the Mig-27 transaction. The FCID launched this investigation following a complaint lodged by defence columnist and political writer Iqbal Athas. In his complaint to the FCID,journalist Iqbal Athas stated that he had written several articles regarding the financial irregularities that had taken place in procuring four Mig-27 aircraft at a higher price. He told the police that these ground attack aircrafts had been manufactured between 1980 and 1983. He said financial irregularities had taken place during the transaction between Sri Lanka and Ukraine.

United we win
The fascistic leader, who ruled the country committing villainous crimes against humanity, has promised to overthrow the yahapalana government before the next Vesak. This man is not joking; with billions of dollars tacked up in places here and elsewhere, while he is marking time. His method should be full of intrigue and violence as there are no elections scheduled before next Vesak.
At the same time Mahinda group is blaming Ranil, Ravi, and other UNP leaders for robbing the Central Bank. If it is an organised joint robbery as Mahinda indicates, then it cannot be a private commitment for individual desire, but an organised politically motivated project, perhaps to finance the counter action to the conspiracy of Mahinda group! Yes I am for it; because I could remember how we faced the Desa Premi attacks in the time of President Premadasa in 88/89. However we are still in the initial stage in the process of creating a democratic constitution with substantial power sharing. When the proposal come before the constituent assembly then Mahinda group will go to town with their vulgar racist campaign as a prelude to the overthrow action.
Western theories on nationalities
In this scenario number of activities launched by Muslim groups to mobilize inter community solidarity such as the 20th commemoration of late Bakeer Markar on August 8 is very important. It was remarkable event in many ways.
The presentation of the guest speaker Prof Davutoglu was interesting, as he explained the emergence and development human identities without following the western theories on nationalities. Apparently Turkey is a country of different human groups up to modern times. This history was certainly interesting. However more attractive was the speech made by Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Prime Minister. Not because of reference to me, in the middle of his elaborations! Instead, he came out with a rational modernist view on the national problem.
According to him, India came out of retrogressive traditions to formulate a constitution that could accommodate dozens of nationalities, many religions and beliefs almost irreconcilable. It was a huge venture. Nehru was supported by intellectuals such as Ambekar and Periar. While such a victory is achieved in India, Russia fell back by the socialism in one country theory which is against Marxist internationalism! The constitution, the supreme law of India, lays down the framework defining fundamental political principles, establishes the structure, procedures, powers and duties of government institutions and sets out fundamental rights, principles and the duties of citizens. It is the longest written constitution of any sovereign country in the world.
B. R. Ambekar, the chairman of the Drafting Committee, supported by Periar, is widely considered to be its chief architect. It imparts constitutional supremacy and not parliamentary supremacy, as it is created by a constituent assembly, and adopted by its people, with a declaration in its preamble. Parliament cannot override the constitution. It declares India sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, assuring its citizens of justice, equality, and liberty, and endeavours to promote fraternity among them.
Supremacy of the Constitution
The Supreme Court has ruled that it cannot destroy what it seeks to modify, which means, while amending anything in the Constitution; it cannot tinker with the basic structure or its framework, which is immutable. Such an amendment will be declared invalid even though no part of the constitution is explicitly prevented from being amended, nor does the basic structure doctrine protect any single provision of the Constitution. Yet, this doctrine of basic features lays down that, the Constitution when read as a whole, that what comes to be understood as its basic features cannot be abridged, deleted or abrogated. These basic features are defined as, the Supremacy of the Constitution; Republican and Democratic form of the Government; Secular Character of the Constitution; Maintenance of Separation of powers; the Federal Character of the Constitution.
This implies that the Parliament, while amending the Constitution, can only amend it to the extent so as not to destroy any of the aforesaid character.
The struggle for a democratic constitution in India was a protracted one. Nehru and his group have to overcome the power of conservative Brahmins. Fortunately educated enlightened Brahmins stood for progress and they won. It was very tiring and exhausting work. At the end Ambekar considered converting to Sikhism, which encouraged opposition to oppression and so appealed to leaders of scheduled castes. But after meeting with Sikh leaders, he concluded that he might get second-rate Sikh status, as described by scholar Stephen P. Cohen.
Instead, he studied Buddhism all his life. Around 1950, he devoted his attention to Buddhism and travelled to Lanka to attend a meeting of the World Fellowship of Buddhists. While dedicating a new Buddhist Vihara near Pune, Ambekar announced he was writing a book on Buddhism and that when it was finished, he would formally convert to Buddhism.
He twice visited Burma in 1954; the second time to attend the third conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhists in Rangoon. In 1955, he founded the Bharatiya Bauddha Maha Sabha, or the Buddhist Society of India. He completed his final work, The Buddha and His Dhamma, in 1956 which was published later after his death.
After meetings with the Sri Lankan Buddhist monk Hammalawa Saddhatissa, Ambekar organised a formal public ceremony for himself and his supporters in Nagpur on October 14, 1956. Accepting the Three Refuges and Five Precepts from a Buddhist monk in the traditional manner, Ambekar completed his own conversion, along with his wife. He then proceeded to convert some 500,000 of his supporters who were gathered around him. He prescribed the 22 Vows for these converts, after the Thun Sarane and Five Precepts. He then traveled to Katmandu, Nepal to attend the Fourth World Buddhist Conference. His work on The Buddha or Karl Marx and Revolution and counter-revolution in ancient India remains to be published.
Fight against tyrannies
Conservative Brahmins still use their influence to cover the collaboration of Periar and Ambekar. Periar or EVR as he was known met and discussed with Ambekar Three Times: As pointed out, EVR first met Ambekar at Bombay on 06-04-40, 07-04-40 and 08-04-40. At that time, they discussed about the creation of separate States for Muslims, Hindus, Depressed classes and Dravidians. Second time, he met him at Madras on 21-09-44, when Ambekar came there officially as a member of Viceroy Council.
At that time, there were two groups in Justice Party and one was opposed to EVR. Third time, they met at Rangoon, Burma during the Third International Buddhist Conference on 05-12-44. At that time, Ambekar revealed that he had decided to convert to Buddhism and urged EVR to convert. But, EVR replied that as long as he was in Hindus he could criticize it, but when he left, he could not. Therefore, he wanted to be in Hinduism to fight against the tyrannies.
It is clear that these leaders discussed the unity of India on the basis of equality, autonomy and the right of self determination. Yet they became respected leaders of India. We have to learn from the struggle in India for unity in diversity. Some things are still in the dark, but struggle is not over.
Are we Lankans going to march forward with a constitution with similar aims and objectives Speech of Ranil was very positive and clear. If that is the view of the government then we can be hopeful. Already the Movement based on all organisations that brought this government to power are preparing for a SATYAGRAHA on August 15 opposite Viharamahadevi Park at 3 p.m. to press the government to go forward to implement the programme promised during the last presidential elections.
Also, it is a mobilization against the racist and chauvinist forces who are preparing to overthrow the government by violence and terror. Such opposition is basically opposed to a new democratic constitution, as they alleged it is against the rights of Sinhala majority. They try to mobilize the Sinhala village youth on this sectarian majoritist theory. For this, they have created a bogey of privatization of education. They oppose the general freedom now exist for private universities to operate under the supervision of the University Grants Commission and the Ministry of Education!

Usain Bolt in numbers - Why the Jamaican is the greatest
A glorious sporting career is coming to an end. Usain Bolt, an eight-time Olympic champion, the fastest man in history, will retire after the IAAF World Championships in London, which run from August 4- 13.
He is a sprinter who has broken records and left a legacy. We look into the numbers which make the 30-year-old Jamaican the greatest sprinter to have lived.
All four of the fastest 100m times in history belong to Bolt. Known in his early years as a prodigiously talented 200m runner, he burst onto the 100m scene by breaking the world record in New York (9.72) in 2008.
Eleven weeks later, in Beijing, he improved on his time, clocking 9.69 as he claimed his first Olympic title.
He has dipped under 10 seconds in the sport's blue riband event 50 times -- putting him fourth on the sub-10 seconds all-time list.
But Bolt, who last lost in 2013, is a man who peaks for championships. Three of his quickest times have been achieved on his way to winning either Olympic or world gold.
His times have been in decline over the years and the days of him breaking world records are clearly over.
The gold-medal winning times aren't what they used to be -- from 9.58 in Berlin to 9.81 in Rio last year.
Only once this season has he gone below 10 seconds, though he should add to that tally in London this weekend.
Men of Bolt's size aren't usually speed freaks. His frame is meant to be an obstacle in an event which requires explosive power out of the blocks.
"We never saw prior to Usain Bolt a sprinter who is 6'5 running the 100m," former Olympic champion Michael Johnson tells CNN Sport. "Typically, that type of athlete would not be able to get out of the blocks and get through the drive phase in the first 30m or so when short, powerful, massive pressure and power is what's required."
With his height and weight, the world record holder would not look out of place on the basketball court. He is notably taller than his rivals, as well as the greats of the past.
Christian Coleman, the fastest man in the world this year, stands at 1.75m, while his long-time rival Justin Gatlin is 1.85m.Scientists have been studying the secret of Bolt's supersonic speed for years.
He hit a top speed of 44.7.8 km/h between 60m and 80m during his world record 100m sprint in Berlin and is almost as explosive as smaller sprinters in the early stages of a 100m race.
Once out of the transition phase, his height comes to his advantage -- the Olympic champion needs only 41 strides to cover 100 meters while other elite runners need 43 or 45.
And once he has reached top speed, he is able to maintain his momentum more efficiently than others, which is crucial in a race won not by the person speeding up at the end but slowing down the least.
Bolt -- who since 2008 has contributed to 40% of the country's medals at Olympic Games and World Championships -- is as cherished as the late singer Bob Marley in his homeland.
Over 30,000 watched him run his last race on home soil in June. But Bolt is also universally loved.
Not only is he one of the wealthiest sportsmen on the planet -- according to Forbes he is 23rd on the list of the highest-paid athletes in 2017 -- but he is also one of the most popular too, with over 7m Instagram followers and 4.7m on Twitter.  CNN

Whitewash least on Kohlis mind
PALLEKELE: While a 3-0 whitewash beckons Virat Kohlis team the Indian captain does not want such distractions to affect his players and lose focus on what they should be doing.
For us its about playing another Test match and trying to win another Test match. We have already won the series. But as I said it doesnt mean that we can be complacent or afford to be complacent. It is another Test match that we are going to try and win, said Kohli at the pre-match press conference yesterday.
You cannot look at these things and go into a game, thats certainly not what we think. I know none of the other team members are also thinking about this because I personally feel that its just a distraction that causes people to be over excited and that causes people to look too far ahead of what might be the outcome of this particular game. We need to stay in the present and treat every session with respect to win a Test match, and thats exactly what we want to follow, he said.
Having won the first two Test rather convincingly and sealed the three-match series India are unlikely to make any changes to their winning combination with the exception of replacing Ravindra Jadeja who has been suspended by the ICC for this match on disciplinary grounds.
We have to understand that to play consistent cricket obviously you need to make sure that people are playing on a regular basis. Those who are performing and those who are doing well should continue in more games than not and to be a consistent side I think we need to have continuity as well unless the situations where things are not controllable arise, said Kohli.
We certainly dont want to take anything lightly. We want to play the same kind of cricket that we have and hopefully retain the team that played the last game as much as we can. So we are certainly not thinking of too many changes at all, especially in this format because you dont want to start taking things for granted and lose that momentum. We certainly are not thinking on drastic chances at this stage, he said.
Kuldeep Yadav who bowls left-arm chinaman is expected to take Jadejas place.
A guy like Kuldeep, when you hand him the ball he is willing to bowl in any situation, willing to bowl with attacking fields, willing to throw the ball up towards the batsmen, he believes in his own ability and believes in deceiving the batsmen with the skill that he has thats his biggest quality, said Kohli.
He has proven himself in Dharamsala which was not such a spin friendly wicket and it was quite flat in the first 2-3 days of the Test match. He turned the game around for us so he has ability, which is very rare to find. A chinaman bowler is always something which is an x-factor in a team and I would say his confidence is his strong point. He has a great chance of playing tomorrow and I wish him all the best.
Although India could not get a full session of practice in the last few days due to bad weather Kohli didnt mind his team taking a few days off.
We are certainly better placed to be able to afford a couple of days. Yesterday (Thursday) we took an off voluntarily and today it just happened to rain but the day before that we had a good practice. Also what you need to understand in places like Sri Lanka it is very hot and humid. People sometimes end up doing too much at practice and then maybe you dont recover for a game, said Kohli.
It might just be a good thing for those who needed more rest especially the bowlers who have massive workload during Test matches. For us I feel its more of a positive thing than a hindrance that we didnt have practice a day before the game because we are in a good zone. Everyone is playing good cricket and everyone is bowling well. So we feel absolutely comfortable going into the Test match even though we didnt practice today.
