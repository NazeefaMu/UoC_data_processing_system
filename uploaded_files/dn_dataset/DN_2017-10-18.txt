External pressures constrain SLs credit
Moodys Investors Service says that Sri Lankas (B1 negative) significant borrowing requirements and heavy reliance on external and foreign-currency funding expose the sovereign to material liquidity and external financing risk, which weighs on the sovereigns credit profile.
Despite a recent increase in foreign exchange reserves, reserve coverage of external obligations remains low.
Unless reserves rise still further, reserve coverage will weaken and external vulnerability will increase from 2019 when large international debt repayments are due. How the authorities prepare for and manage these risks will be critical to stabilizing the external financing position. Reforms that continue to advance fiscal consolidation and exchange rate flexibility, along with implementation of an effective external liability management strategy, would mitigate external risks and help support Sri Lankas credit profile.
Moodys conclusions are contained in its just-released report on the Government of Sri Lanka, External pressures constrain credit profile.
Moodys assesses Sri Lankas external vulnerability as Moderate, reflecting its view that sudden shifts in external conditions could weaken the sovereigns credit profile. This external vulnerability stems from the structure of the countrys government debt, with large shares of external financing and foreign currency debt combining to heighten the governments susceptibility to changes in financing conditions.
As of 2016, total external debt (local and foreign currency external debt of combined public and private sectors) was about $47 billion (about 57% of GDP), of which approximately 68% was public sector debt.
Meanwhile, the governments foreign currency-denominated debt was about 43% of total general government debt in 2016 and about 34% of GDP. Moodys notes that Sri Lankas foreign currency reserves fell to a low of $4.1 billion in April 2017 from a peak of just over $8.1 billion in August 2014, but by August 2017, reserves had been rebuilt to $6.7 billion.
Despite this improvement, reserves adequacy remains relatively weak and Sri Lanka has several large external debt repayments due between 2019 and 2022. The bunching of these future external liabilities, which will average $3.6 billion per year, raises rollover and external vulnerability risks. Meanwhile, the debt-financing of Sri Lankas persistent current account deficits adds to future external financing needs.
Sri Lankas current account deficits, at 2.4% of GDP in 2016, are driven by large structural trade deficits and add to external financing requirements. Annual net foreign direct investment (FDI), which was 1.2% of GDP in 2016, does not fully fund the deficit. Hence the current account deficit will continue to be partly financed through debt inflows, leading to further accumulation of debt liabilities. At the same time, reforms could help to reduce Sri Lankas external vulnerability, but their impact is not fully clear yet.
Moving forward, sustained fiscal consolidation and a more flexible exchange rate will have a credit positive impact by reducing external borrowing requirements and preserving foreign exchange reserves. However, the design and implementation of an effective and transparent external liability management strategy remains incomplete. How these multipronged reform areas combine and shape external vulnerability will help determine Sri Lankas credit profile.

Investors are coming to Sri lanka without fear. Thirty two hotels in the Batticaloa district will be constructed and over 10,000 direct employment facilities will be created. In addition, the Trincomalee district too will be developed and the Government of Japan will assist Sri Lanka in this regard. On the other hand, China will assist the Hambantota development projects, he added.

I must note that the TNA played an active and positive role at the constitutional council meetings, he added.
An Indian delegation is to arrive at Sri Lanka and the Prime minister had requested to prepare a development plan to hold discussions with them. Under the North Eastern road development plan, roads from Jaffna to Mannar, Mannar to Vavuniya,Vavuniya to Trincomalee and Trincomalee to Jaffna will be developed.

May the light of Deepavali lighten hearts: Presidents Deepavali message

President Maithripala Sirisena, in a message issued for Deepavali, which falls today, said he hoped the light of Deepavali would lighten up the hearts of all individuals.
Just as lighting a lamp eliminates the darkness, may the light of Deepavali lighten up the hearts of all individuals with collective yearning for reconciliation and may that be the common wish of every human being belonging to all civilizations, the President said.
The full message is reproduced below:
I am very pleased to send this message of greetings on the occasion of the festival of Deepavali celebrated by the Hindus throughout the world, symbolizing the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, good over evil, and hope over despair. They celebrate this with much joy and happiness by lighting lamps and illuminating their homes and places of worship.
The ardent desire of every human being on this earth is to make efforts to dispel ignorance through gaining knowledge. Since ancient times, human beings depended on light and their lifecycle was adapted accordingly. The knowledge is important for the spiritual life of a human being as well as for their material life.
Just as lighting a lamp eliminates the darkness, may the light of Deepavali lighten up the hearts of all individuals with collective yearning for reconciliation and may that be the common wish of every human being belonging to all civilizations.
When harmony has become essential for the existence not only of our country but also of the entire world, we should be totally committed to build a deep bond and mutual understanding based on the coexistence and reconciliation, avoiding the divisions of race, religion, caste etc. The cultural ceremonies such as Deepavali are immensely helpful to bring forth the message of harmony. I wish all the Hindus in Sri Lanka and abroad who celebrate Deepavali with utmost devotion and fervour be bestowed with happiness and prosperity and illuminate their lives with wisdom.

Alleged plot to kill Maldives President by Sri Lankan
The Ministry of Justice through Police has sought Colombo Chief Magistrate Courts permission to record a statement from a Sri Lankan in connection with an alleged plot to assassinate the incumbent Maldives President Abdulla Yameen in 2015.
The Ministry of Justice had made a request from Colombo Chief Magistrate that the Colombo Crimes Division be granted permission to record a statement from Yassari Danushka Perera regarding the incident.
The Ministry of Justice in Sri Lanka had decided to initiate a magisterial inquiry into the incident following a request by the government of Maldives in terms of section 10 (1) of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act No.25 of 2002.
When the case came up before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the counsel who appeared on behalf of Yassari Danushka Perera told court that his client was not present in Court since he is currently receiving treatment at a private hospital in Colombo. President Abdulla Yameen narrowly escaped injury when a blast struck the boat he was using to return home from the airport on October 20, 2015.

Amarasekara urges Mahinda Rajapaksa  to quit Constitutional Assembly
Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekara urged Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa to get away from the process of preparing a new constitution since it would be a severe threat to the countrys territorial integrity.
He was addressing the media yesterday at the Federation of National Organisations (FNO) office, Rajagiriya.
On behalf of the FNO, Amarasekara urged Rajapaksa to quit the Constitutional Assembly.
Journalist Mohan Samaranayaka addressing the media said the unitary government was not mandated by people to prepare a new constitution. He said the on-going constitution making process was illegal.
The prepared draft for the new constitution contains harmful clauses to the territorial integrity and the unitary status of the country. It was prepared to carry out the hidden agenda of international forces including certain western countries and organisations Once the new constitution is implemented, disputes would arise among ethnicities in the country. Therefore, the entire process should be given up, he said.
He said that no one should be allowed to destroy peace by bringing a new constitution.
No one asks for a new constitution, but the Government is attempting to introduce a constitution by force. It is clear that certain segments want to obtain federal status through bringing the constitution, he said.
He said the Constitutional time bomb should be defused to protect the country from division.

Aviation fuel pipeline from Muthurajawela  to Katunayake
Laying of the Jet A-01 Aviation fuel delivery pipeline from Muthurajawela to Katunayake Bandaranaike International Airport will be expedited during the next few months, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said.
Addressing a progress review meeting held at the Ministry auditorium yesterday, Minister Ranatunga said, earlier plan was to lay the pipeline along the Hamilton Canal through Nugape-Bopitiya up to Pamunugama and from there to Katunayake parallel to the Colombo Katunayake Expressway. Since this was an arduous task as the plan was to cut across roadways, the RDA has agreed to lay it parallel to the Expressway due to the successful completion of the feasibility studies. The general international practice was to ensure a service corridor when building Expressways. Although Expressways had been built earlier without due thought to that practice, they had the possibility and room to build such a corridor, Minister Ranatunga added.
Meanwhile, a Ministry release said the countrys main aviation fuel supply dump is situated at the Katunayake Airport. At present, Aviation fuel is transported by train from the Kolonnawa Petroleum installation to Katunayake. At times bowsers are also deployed for this job. But according to present calculations, operations from Kolonnawa alone would not be able to meet the daily requirements. The present daily demand of 1.6 million litres is expected to increase to 2 million litres in 2020 and to 3.5 million litres in 2030.
As such, it is hoped to transport fuel from the Muthurajawela installation too to Katunayake in future. The pipeline from Muthurajawela to Katunayake would facilitate this. According to the earlier plan the pipeline length would have been 23.3 kilometers.
The length of the pipeline would be reduced by 3.5 km under the latest decision to lay it parallel to the Expressway. The number of bends too had been greatly reduced. As such, more than 200,000 kw hours of electricity could be saved annually in pumping fuel.
At present the Katunayake Aviation fuel terminal had received the good grading according to the Joint Inspection Group Grading. The grading may be upgraded to Excellent once the new project was completed.
Ranatunga said, due to the cost reduction in transport, Sri Lanka would gain the opportunity to supply aviation fuel at competitive prices in the region.
Ranatunga said, it was public money that was being used for projects of this nature and they were duty bound to use that money profitably without unnecessary wastage.

Requests President to extend warrant period
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury Bond issue yesterday completed recording evidence which began on February 21, 2017.
Commission Chairman, Supreme Court Judge, Justice K.T. Chithrasiri stated that in the event any new material is identified and the Commissioners are of the view that such evidence should be placed as formal evidence, further hearings will be held.
Justice Chithrasiri said hearings continued for 120 days with 63 witnesses giving evidence before the Commission.
Chairman Justice Chithrasiri also stated that the Commission of Inquiry has forwarded a list of questions, in the nature of interrogatories to the Prime Minister requesting him to provide his answers by way of an affidavit.
Upon receipt of the affidavit, the Commission of Inquiry will peruse its contents and, if necessary, request the Hon.Prime Minister to attend a hearing of the Commission of Inquiry to give evidence or request the Hon.Prime Minister to provide further clarification, as this Commission of Inquiry considers necessary, the statement further said.
Chairman Justice Chithrasiri also said that they are compelled to request from the President to extend the warrant period of the Treasury Bond Commission, considering that the Commission is now at the complex, arduous and time consuming exercise of preparing the report of the Commission which needs careful studying and analysing of all the oral and documentary evidence received by the Commission. The Commissions mandate period will end on October 27, 2017.
The Commission commended the Attorney Generals panel for the assistance they gave to the tribunal. The statement further said that They have worked long hours and have demonstrated sustained dedication to their task of presenting evidence, which has to be gathered from a very large amount of documents and after consultation with many persons.
The Commission appreciated the contribution of other legal counsels who assisted the Commission, the CID officers attached to it and to the Commission Secretary S. Udugamasuriya.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera expressed his gratitude to the Commission and thanked the CID officers who were very much dedicated to unravel crucial information in the investigation. He also commended the team from the Central Bank who assisted the Attorney Generals Department in the investigation.
ASG Kodagoda said there would be more witnesses and evidence unearthed and requested the Commission to consider these new evidences as well. While pointing out the findings of the Commission at present is like a half baked cake, ASG Kodagoda observed that it is the duty of the Commission to give a properly baked cake to the public. ASG Kodagoda also alleged that PTL, with the evidence before the Commission, is a criminal organisation doing insider trading, bribing and destroying evidence.
Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) owner Arjun Aloysiuss Personal Assistant Steve Samuel yesterday testified before the Commission. He was supposed to testify before the Commission last week. However, his legal assistant informed the tribunal that he has had a cardiac arrest and was hospitalised.
The Commission, after finding out that Samuel was discharged requested his legal representative to appear before the Commission to testify.
Senior State Counsel Dr. Avanti Perera who lead evidence for the day, questioned Samuel on several text messages he has sent to his boss Arjun Aloysius. He was also questioned on two files maintained under the headings AM and RK.
A text message sent by Samuel to Aloysius, on November 8, 2017 says, next meeting at 7 a.m. with Ravi K. Another message on November 22, 2016 says Yes, I do have it on my notes for today-RK/TO DO LIST. And also we have the A.Mahendran  To Do LIST. Another message on January 3, 2017 says Reminder-Meeting at 10pm with RK/New to do list file/and AM to do list will be sent home. Another message said, GM Chairman. Hope you had a good meeting with RK. Just update me when you and I meet before you leave tonight.
SSC Dr. Avanti Perera asked Samuel who RK, Ravi K, AM and A Mahendran are. Samuels denied any knowledge of who RK he was referring to when he sent the messages. However, Samuel understands A. Mahendran to be Anjalee Mahendran, his bosss wife. SSC Dr. Avanti Perera asked did not AM mean Arjun Mahendran. Samuel said he never corresponded for Arjun Mahendran. He also said he was not exposed to any files under the headings of AM or RK. According to Samuel the documents he received were usually enveloped and sealed.
SSC Dr. Avanti Perera: So, it your position that you dont know who RK is
Steve Samuel: No, I dont know.
SSC: But you refer to a good meeting (she is referring to the content of a certain message)
SS: I usually greet him so. It could be a Good Morning, Good Day. It is a normal thing I do as a PA.
Justice Jayawardena: Now, Mr. Samuel it would be good if you cooperate. Obviously your boss would know about the RK and AM. Perhaps, Arjun Aloysius would have been in the habit of meeting then finance minister Ravi Karunanayake for various reasons.
SS: He does not tell me about his meetings. I have never gone to any of his meetings. I dont sit in his office.
JJ: You obviously would have known this meeting is important.
SS: I must have reminded about the meeting to him.
JJ: So who is this all important RK
SS: I was not informed about it.
JJ: Are you still an employee of Perpetual Treasuries Limited
SS: Yes.
While, SSC Perera was carrying the witness through several more messages and repetitively questioned as to who RK and AM are, Justice P.S. Jayawardena observed that Samuel has taken a position to give answers in such nature so that it is better to put the questions to him, receive his answer and move on with the questioning.
At this instance, Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda rose to observe that the witness is speaking falsehood. This man who has punched these text messages into his phone now says he does not know or cannot remember about them. Are we to blindly accept that he sent these messages without knowing about these people he exclaimed.
Justice Jayawardena: It is very clear to us that he knew exactly who he was referring to when he typed these messages.
ASG K: This man is lying! He is blatantly lying and misleading the Commission
JJ: I do not want to be accused of pre-judging but the conclusion of his evidence is very clear.
SS: (states that he is not lying)
JJ: At the time you were sending text messages, you knew exactly who you were referring to. But now you claim you cannot remember.
SS: Yes, I cannot remember.
Samuel was also asked questions on several more text messages where he mentions a person called Saman Indika Kumara. While Samuel denied knowing the said person, Dr. Avanti Perera asked if the person he was referring to was Indika Saman Kumara who was the Chief Dealer of the Employees Provident Fund. Samuel said he has never seen this person.
Samuel was also questioned on an email of which the subject says Meeting Boss-RK/Reminder Proposed auction for the Week. The email has been generated on March 29, 2017. Samuel again denied knowing as to who RK is. Dr. Perera pointed out that there was in fact a bond auction the same week the email was sent.
When asked on files under the headings of AM and RK, Samuel again denied knowing what is meant by RK and AM. He said that he does not maintain these files and said he does not know as to who maintain the said file. Samuel said I am not doing anything other than what is told.
Meanwhile, Samuels broke down and cried in the witness box when his legal representative questioned on his mothers condition. Samuel said that his mother is at ICU at present in a coma.
The Assistant Director of the Department of Supervision of Non Banking Financial Institutions of the Central Bank P.S. Sedara gave evidence before the Commission as well.

UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday categorically denied that he addressed a letter to Court requesting it to reject the bail applications made by suspects involved in the Hambantota Protest Campaign against the Mattala Airport project.
Mahinda Amaraweera in a statement issued yesterday said, a group led by Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa addressing the media after their release on bail on October 16 alleged that he (Amaraweera) had sent a letter to Court requesting that they be refused bail and the court totally disregarded and threw the letter away.
This type of allegation which is a complete travesty of the truth was a calculated effort to tarnish his clean political image, he said.
The Minister said he would not consider this as a trivial thing. It was the responsibility of the Attorney Generals Department to ascertain the truth regarding this allegation.
As such, he lodged a complaint with the Attorney General and requests him to ascertain the truth about this issue as it could be deduced as contempt of Court on the part of those who leveled this false allegation.
Amaraweera said he hopes to take suitable legal action against the unfounded allegation.

The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka hosted a delegation from the Guangzhou municipal Government headed by Tu Hongze, Vice Counsel are in Colombo on a fact finding visit to evaluate the possibility of enterprises from Guangzhou formally known as Canton, investing and trading with Sri Lanka.
The visit was co-ordinated by Shanika Dissanayake Sri Lankas Consul General in Guangzhou.
Tu, the leader of the delegation spoke of the importance of Guangzhou in China. The city is third largest in China after Beijing and Shanghai, with a very large land area and gross domestic product of US$300 billion. Tu stated that if Guangzhou were to have been a separate state, it would have the 14th largest economy in the world.
We are looking at opportunities. We have learnt a lot from the presentation done by the BOI and are keen to send the message that Sri Lanka is an ideal tourism destination which combines beaches, nature and historical sites, Tu added. We are from the Government of Guangzhou. Whilst this is first our visit to Sri Lanka,it has provided an opportunity for us to study the business climate of the country, we are also appreciative of the fact that there are very close ties between the Governments and the peoples of Sri Lanka and China.
The Chinese Government is keen to do the large projects in Sri Lanka and is looking at investment opportunities notably in the tourism sector.
Currently there are 1.4 million tourists travelling annually from Guangzhou and I am confident that in the future there would be more who will opt for Sri Lanka as a holiday destination. I also believe that this is the ideal time to engage in investment in Sri Lanka and with Free Trade Agreements that Sri Lanka has entered into with India, Pakistan and in future with China, in addition to the return of the EU GSP+ facility,thanks to enhanced market access, Sri Lanka will become a very attractive destination for future investments.

The Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) yesterday criticised the appointment of North Central Provincial Councilor Ananda Sarath Kumara as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Organiser for the Anamaduwa Electorate.
Ceylon Teachers Union General Secretary Joseph Stalin said in 2014, Sarath Kumara was sentenced to two years Rigorous Imprisonment suspended for seven years by the Puttalam Hight Court and ordered to pay compensation amounting to Rs.300,000 for forcing a female school teacher to kneel before him. He was also ordered to pay a fine of Rs.50,000 and in default, serve a prison term of six months.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa refused to grant nominations to him and President Maithripala Sirisena too cannot justify by appointing him.
President Sirisenas decision to reappoint Ananda is a major threat to the public service.Asking a female school teacher to kneel down was not a minor incident. We were surprised by the Presidents decision and urge him to reconsider it or we would have to take stern action over the matter, Stalin added.

Deepavali Messages: Brings us closer to divinity
"Deepavali signifies the victory of good over evil, from darkness to light. The light empowers to do good things which brings us closer to divinity. On the day of Deepavali we spread light in every corner to dispel darkness," Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama says in his Deepavali message.
"Its a festival of lights. The word Deep means light and the word avali means row; that is row of lights. It falls on the day of Amavasya, when moon does not rise and there is darkness all around.
"For the Hindus, darkness represents ignorance and light is compared to knowledge. Lighting lamp symbolizes the destruction of all negative forces or vices through knowledge. It is through light the beauty of the world is revealed or experienced. In the path of bhathi when the demons under the leadership of Naragasuran started harassing and committing lot of atrocities to the deities who made a complaint to Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna killed Naragasuran and gave victory to the deities over devils. This day is celebrated on Deepavali as a memorial of victory over the vices for the people in the modern age as well as in ages in the past.
"Deepavali is a festival where people from all age groups participate. They express their happiness by lighting lamps, decorating their houses, putting fire crackers and inviting relations to their house to take part for a meal.
The lighting of lamps is a way of praying to God for attainment of health, wealth, knowledge and peace. It is one time in the whole year that the children volunteer to leave their beds long before the day begins and have traditional oil bath early in the morning.
They get themselves dressed with new clothes and get into their festive attire, light up oil lamps and scented sticks. This express the purity level even at the path of bhakthi.
"May this festival of lights bring lots of light into your lives and along with that may it bring joy, happiness and prosperity for you and your family," the Governor stated.

"I am privileged and pleased to extend my greetings to the Hindu devotees on this joyous occasion of Deepavali, one of the most gracious celebrations of Hindu devotees worldwide," Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga in his Deepavali Message said.
"According to sacred Hindi texts distressed people who underwent unbearable torment at the hands of demonic narasuras pleaded with Lord Visnu to rid them of the evil elements which Lord Vishnu obliged by defeating the demons at war. Liberated people in thanksgiving celebrate Deepavali with utmost reverence while performing religious rites and engaging in fasting.
The word 'Deepavali' is made of two words; deep (lamp) and avali (row), which means a line or a row of lamps. Hindus around the world have been celebrating Deepavali from time immemorial on a religious note and with sublime adoration receiving divine blessing which illuminate their lives," the Minister stated.

Deepavali messages: May Deepavali light up  all hearts: President
I am very pleased to send this message of greetings on the occasion of the festival of Deepavali celebrated by the Hindus throughout the world, symbolizing the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, good over evil, and hope over despair. They celebrate this with much joy and happiness by lighting lamps and illuminating their homes and places of worship, stated President Maithripala Sirisena sending a message marking Deepavali.
The message added: The ardent desire of every human being on this earth is to make efforts to dispel ignorance through gaining knowledge. Since ancient times, human beings depended on light and their lifecycle was adapted accordingly. The knowledge is important for the spiritual life of a human being as well as for their material life.
Just as lighting a lamp eliminates the darkness, may the light of Deepavali lighten up the hearts of all individuals with collective yearning for reconciliation and may that be the common wish of every human being belonging to all civilizations.
When harmony has become essential for the existence not only of our country but also of the entire world, we should be totally committed to build a deep bond and mutual understanding based on the coexistence and reconciliation, avoiding the divisions of race, religion, caste etc. The cultural ceremonies such as Deepavali are immensely helpful to bring forth the message of harmony. I wish all the Hindus in Sri Lanka and abroad who celebrate Deepavali with utmost devotion and fervour be bestowed with happiness and prosperity and illuminate their lives with wisdom.

Jain and Hindu believers celebrate Deepavali with the sacred light of truth that wins over the darkness of evil.
The true meaning of Deepavali is found in overcoming lies with the truth, hatred with love, evil with goodness and defeat with victory, stated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his message marking Deepavali.
The message added: Deepavali also signifies the re-entry of Prince Rama and Pandyan Princes from hiding into the light, triumphantly overcoming the evil ones.
Jains believe that Deepavali celebrates the occasion when their teacher Mahaweera entered Moksha. They believe that Deepavali, therefore, heralds in love and compassion for all. May this Deepavali be the occasion to light a thousand lamps in our hearts and to drive away the darkness of hate.
May it be the opportunity to restore lives, rebuild relationships and pave the way for harmony and healing.
I wish all a happy Deepavali.

'Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia record decrease in dengue cases'
The dengue eradication programme carried out by the Local Government Authorities was a proven success. The most successful was the one carried out in the Dehiwala, Mount Lavinia areas, Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry Secretary Kamal Pathmasiri said.
He was addressing the media in Colombo recently.
He said hotels, factories, traders would be asked to pay a levy for the garbage disposal scheme.
We have appointed a committee to look into that because local authorities charge different rates for the garbage disposal, he said.
The Secretary said Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia recorded 90 percent reduction in dengue cases this year when compared to the figure recorded in the last year..
Dehiwala Medical Officer S. M. R. Oddyar said the areas reported 490 dengue cases by July and the figure has dropped to 38 in September and has reduced to 20 in October.
The present number was the lowest reported from a Municipal Council in the Colombo District," he seaid.
We expect a slight increase in dengue cases in December. If we take necessary action we can control it, he said.
Dehiwala-Mt Lavania Municipal Commissioner Dammika Muthugal said his officers had carried out a successful dengue control programme together with the officers of the Dehiwela-Ratmalana Divisional Secretariats, Medical Officers, Police and members of the public.
The Dehiwala-Mt Lavania area has the least number of dengue cases in the Western Province.
Everyone says rainy season increases dengue. We are researching in this regard. We must appreciate workers who provided their services in numerous ways to control the disease. Some workers contracted respiratory diseases. Some wanted to resign.
We were able to win over the disease since we worked as a team," he said.
Several under-developed sites in the area are breeding grounds for dengue mosquitoes. We intend to acquire them under the Public Nuisance Act, he said.

Delay in provincial polls irks election watchdogs
Election Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya who is in receipt of a draft gazette notification on the much anticipated Provincial Council polls, said the Commission cannot act on its own to declare the elections until the Provincial Council and Local Government Ministry decides to do it first.
Speaking to the Daily News, the Commissioner who had met with election watchdogs said they were irked at the delay and repeatedly questioned the reason as to why the Election Commission was not proactive on the matter.
Although I have a draft, it is the responsibility of the Minister to publicize the gazette notification, after which we will issue one declaring the number of days that would be needed before the elections are held. This, he said, can be between 50-75 days at most.
He added that there were no hindrances to holding the election before Thai Pongal which falls on January 14 next year. My only concern is that we cannot have elections during the Ordinary Level Examinations or during the last four days of the year since we will not be able to dispatch public servants for official election duty, he said. After that, any day is fine with us.
The Election Commissioner met with several election watchdogs including Transparency International, Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL), the Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFEE), National Polls Observation Centre (NPOC), Movement for Free and Fair Elections (MFFE) yesterday, to discuss the impending local provincial polls.
They have questioned me repeatedly on the delay to which the only answer I have at the moment is that we too are waiting on the Minister to publicize the gazette. Nothing can be done until such time.

Distribution of funds for agro-well reconstruction
The Yahapalana government has no problems regarding political parties constituting it. The two main parties are following a new political journey in unity, endeavouring to rebuild the country. People should be provided maximum facilities possible. However, we will face the forthcoming local government elections separately.
Then we can fight on dogmatic issues and conduct a campaign based on principles by eschewing political thuggery, said SLFP General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
He was addressing a meeting to mark the distribution of funds for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of agro-wells in Anuradhapura district under the Food Production National Program recently.
A government grant of Rs. 200,000 is made under this program for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of each agro-well and an easy loan up to a maximum of Rs. 200,000 is given for the purchase of water pumps and pipes at 6 percent interest.
Rs. 150,000 was distributed among a batch of 400 farmers as the first stage of the program on this day.
Minister Dissanayake said the balance money needed for the rehabilitation of agro-wells would be given in stages.
The Minister said that we should prepare our strategies to face future climate changes. The agro-wells project was launched to prepare in facing any possible drought.
Farmers gathered at auditorium to receive their cheques for Agro-well reconstruction.
The Minister said the country did not receive the expected rainfall during the last two years, while unexpected rainfall was experienced during unwanted periods causing damage to crops. These climate changes were common to all countries in the world, but we should not neglect agricultural activities in the face of such catastrophes, he added.
The Minister said they would invite all house holders to cultivate some sort of food crop or vegetable in their home gardens so that they could relieve the burden on their purse strings. It is hoped to develop 500,000 home gardens throughout the country with the help of womens organisations.
Plans would be implemented to rehabilitate 1000 tanks in the country. This rehabilitation project would be genuine and not a farce as done during the previous regime where contractors raked in millions of rupees by doing a roughshod job.
A sum of Rs 5 million had been provided to each DS division to rehabilitate agricultural roads. It had been planned to cultivate coconut on 10,000 acres in the NCP. All parties in the government had joined hands to develop the country without any political or other differences.
Parliamentarian Chandima Gamage Mahindasoma, former Minister W. B. Ekanayake and several local politicians and officials participated.

Lufthansa said it hoped to establish a new Alitalia, but was only interested in parts of the existing business.
EasyJet said it had submitted an expression of interest but also only wanted certain assets of a restructured Alitalia.
Europe's airline industry is fiercely competitive, with Monarch and Air Berlin failing in recent weeks.
On Monday, the last of 110,000 Monarch customers who were abroad when the airline collapsed were flown home, according to the UK aviation regulator.
Ongoing competition from budget airlines, terror attacks in popular holiday destinations, and rising fuel prices have made it difficult for some airlines to keep going. Alitalia said it had received seven offers by the 17:00 GMT deadline on Monday and would now assess them. The Italian government has postponed the deadline for making a final decision over the Alitalia sale from 4 November to April 2018. The government also announced a further 300m (267m) in loans on Friday to keep the carrier flying. (Gadgets)

Hawaii judge blocks Trump's latest travel ban

A federal judge in Hawaii has blocked President Donald Trump's revised travel ban one day before it was set to take effect.
Judge Derrick Watson said the travel ban -- Trump's third version of the policy -- "plainly discriminates based on nationality.
" The President's executive order "suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor: it lacks sufficient findings that the entry of more than 150 million nationals from six specified countries would be 'detrimental to the interests of the United States,'" Watson wrote.
The second version of the travel ban, issued in March, had barred residents of six Muslim-majority countries -- Iran, Syria, Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen.
The new restrictions that were set to take effect Wednesday cover eight countries -- Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Somalia and Yemen. Tuesday's ruling does not impact the restrictions on North Korea and Venezuela. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders called the ruling "dangerously flawed."
"The entry restrictions in the proclamation apply to countries based on their inability or unwillingness to share critical information necessary to safely vet applications, as well as a threat assessment related to terrorism, instability, and other grave national security concerns," Sanders said in a statement.
Judges turn to extreme remedy to block Trump administration Judge Derrick Watson said the travel ban -- Trump's third version of the policy -- "plainly discriminates based on nationality."
The President's executive order "suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor: it lacks sufficient findings that the entry of more than 150 million nationals from six specified countries would be 'detrimental to the interests of the United States,'" Watson wrote. The second version of the travel ban, issued in March, had barred residents of six Muslim-majority countries -- Iran, Syria, Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen.
The Justice Department will "appeal in an expeditious manner," spokesman Ian Prior said.
"Today's ruling is incorrect, fails to properly respect the separation of powers, and has the potential to cause serious negative consequences for our national security."
Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin celebrated the order. The state has been fighting each version of the travel ban.
"This is the third time Hawaii has gone to court to stop President Trump from issuing a travel ban that discriminates against people based on their nation of origin or religion," Chin said in a statement.
"Today is another victory for the rule of law. We stand ready to defend it."

India Diwali: Delhi acts against pollution menace

India's capital is enacting a plan to curb combat hazardous smog, as air pollution in Delhi hits "very severe" levels.
The plan, which includes traffic restrictions and the shutdown of a major power plant, was announced after Delhi saw severe pollutionlast year.
The measures, which were ordered by a Supreme Court mandated panel, come days before the Hindu festival of Diwali.
The court has already banned the sale and distribution of fireworks in Delhi.
Diwali, the most important Hindu festival in north India, celebrates the victory of good over evil.
However in the last few years, celebrations have seen air pollution rise to hazardous levels after many firecrackers were set off.
The winter months in Delhi already see high pollution levels due to farmers in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryanaburning stubbleto clear their fields, and the burning of rubbish in the city.
These are some of the major changes that have come into effect:
A major power plant will be shut until 15 March
The Badarpur power plant, located in south Delhi, will be closed until March 2018 before permanently shutting down in July 2018.
According to a 2015 study by the Centre for Science and Environment, it is the most polluting power plant in India.
The plant contributed just 8% of the city's electric power but produced more than 80% of Delhi's particulate matter pollution from the energy sector.
It was shut down temporarily last November to alleviate air quality during the Delhi smog but was reopened in March this year.
Officials told reporters that the plant was supposed to close on 15 October, but that was delayed as it was supplying power to the stadium hosting Fifa under-17 World Cup matches in Delhi.
The panel will also monitor emissions from power plants located close to the city.
Restrictions on vehicles
Vehicular emission is one of the main reasons for air pollution in Delhi, and there have also been past efforts to discourage people from using private cars.
The panel has said that if air pollution worsens further, parking rates inside the city will see a fourfold increase. It currently costs about 20 rupees an hour ($0.30; 0.20) to use municipal car parks.
It may also bring back a car rationing scheme which will see cars with even and odd number plates only being allowed on alternate days.
The panel has said it will also look at increasing the frequency of the city's metro trains and buses.
A ban on private generators
Diesel generators are often utilised by private homeowners and businesses in an effort to combat Delhi's often erratic power supply.
Many of them are, however, poorly maintained which causes them to emit large amounts of smoke and fumes.
The measure, which will be in place until March, is likely to have an impact on weddings, which often use generators to power lights and music for celebration.
Several small business owners have told reporters that they are unhappy with the decision.

Indian economy on solid growth track, says IMF chief Lagarde
The Indian economy is on a solid growth track in the medium and long term due to the structural reforms undertaken by the government, and the current slowdown due to implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetisation is short term, International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Christine Lagarde has said.
The IMF recently lowered India's growth forecast for 2017-18 to 6.7% from its earlier estimate of 7.2%, citing lingering impact of demonetisation and transition cost to GST. But, India is expected to regain the fastest growing major economy tag next year when it is forecast to grow 7.4% (slower than earlier estimate of 7.7%), higher than China's 6.5%. IMF also expects the Indian economy to grow 8% in the medium term on the back of reforms undertaken so far.
"We have slightly downgraded India. However, we believe that India is on a growth track for the medium and long term, that is much more solid as a result of the structural reforms that have been conducted in India in the last couple of years," Lagarde told a news conference in Washington, DC.
"Now, of course the demonetisation that took place, of course collapsing 40 different taxes into one single GST is a monumental effort and given the implementation associated with, it is hardly surprising that there is a little bit of a short-term slowdown as a result but for the medium term we see a very solid track ahead of the Indian economy," she said.
Lagarde was confident that jobs would be created in India on the back of reforms unveiled by the government.
The Narendra Modi-led government has faced criticism after growth slowed to a three-year low of 5.7% in the June quarter, prompting the PM to slam critics for spreading what he called was "pessimism".
"The (fiscal) deficit has been reduced, inflation is down significantly and the structural reforms will deliver jobs the Indian population, particularly the young Indian people, expect in the future," the IMF chief said indicating a strong support for the government's reforms agenda.

Main focus of budget should be to alleviate poverty
The budget for the next year is scheduled to be presented to the parliament in next month.
A budget that estimates income and expenses of the economy says economic direction of the country, as it decides on financial ups and downs in different industries which create employments for the nation.
The budget 2018 is very crucial, by all accounts, because the budgets that the good governance government, since its inception, has presented before the parliament, has been criticized constructively as well as maliciously.
Hence, the government is expected at this time to address problems arising from the neglected areas and thereby main focus should be to alleviate poverty in the country.
Poverty alleviation has to be the top priority for any government, as the voters that elected the government suffer from the poverty, without any ability to claim for a good living standard.
Whatever said or done, the final outcome must be to alleviate poverty. Be it export development, reducing imports, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) attraction, private sector encouragement, tax imposition or reduction, embarking new development projects and finally any kind of economic policy, they are directly or indirectly connected with poverty alleviation strategies, creating cash inflows to the country, building infrastructure facilities and creating employments which ultimately increase peoples purchasing power and mitigate poverty.
Poverty
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) refers to poverty as a deprivation of essential assets and opportunities to which every human being is entitled. Furthermore, the Copenhagen declaration at the world summit on social development described poverty as a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education and information.
The same situation in rural areas can be called rural poverty. According to Head Count Index 2012/2013, urban poverty was 2.4%, rural poverty was 7.5% and estate poverty was 6.2%.
Many people considered poor, belong to the rural parts of the country. Basic statistics 2017 issued by Asian Development Bank says that 6.7% of the population live below the poverty line in Sri Lanka.
Investment
Even if it is true that investments pave the way for employments and economic development, there have to be savings to be turned into capital. Thats why; Sri Lanka, as a country, is always keen on attracting foreign investments.
The government is expected to make necessary proposals to attract foreign investors, while encouraging local investors, as that is one of the best options to accelerate economic growth by increasing production and exports.
Consequently, employment opportunities in the private sector go up in comparison to those in public sector which of course have become a huge burden which every citizen has to shoulder, especially irrespective of where they are employed. More investments mean more business expansion causing more employments.
Tax
Tax is a compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the government on workers income and business profits, or added to the cost of some goods, services, and transactions. How taxes are imposed and what are going to be done with tax money is of the significance, as it has a serious impact on personal wealth, business operations and the economy at large. It is needless to say that higher taxes decrease purchasing power, resulting in low consumer demand which then means low profit for companies. It is with low profits and higher levies that companies are likely to decide on reducing cost and postponing business expansion. The smooth cycle of the economy can be obviously broken by imposition of higher taxes, putting people into poverty.
When it comes to government revenue, non-tax revenue comes first. Hence, government must focus their attention to further increase non-tax revenue by restructuring State-owned enterprises (SOEs), in order that government enterprises can make a significant contribution to the economy, while tax revenue can also be increased by bridging the gap between direct and indirect taxes via new Inland Revenue act.
These are directly related to poverty alleviation, since higher government revenue can be allocated for building infrastructure facilities which enable people, particularly in rural areas to transport their goods to the market and industrialists to set up their factories in remote areas where cheap labor is available.
Expectations
This budget has to be prepared giving priority to economics, not to politics. The cultural fault is that people are used to expecting budgetary reliefs rather than seeking sound economic proposals to boost economic development.
An election seems to be held next year. Accordingly, it is up to the government to draft the budget without being politically motivated.
What could be observed for past few decades was that rulers prioritized politics more than economics, as they aimed at elections, not at development. This time, the government is expected to present an economically sound budget, not popular budget, as it brings only cost. In conclusion, main focus of the budget should be to alleviate poverty.

Over 3,000 teachers to get transfers
Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) Secretary Joseph Stalin said the Education Ministry had taken measures to transfer over 3,000 teachers, who had served in National Schools for over 10 years. There are 38,000 teachers in 353 national schools in the country and nearly 12,000 teachers had served in the same school for more than 10 years.
They hope to implement the transfer scheme to enhance the efficiency by utilising valuable human resources in the education system through optimum teacher allocation.
In order to address this situation, the Ministry has decided to transfer 3,000 Advanced Level teachers, as a first step.
The second phase of this programme will get underway in January 2018 where it is planned to transfer 9,000 teachers from grades one to eleven. All school teachers are subject to transfers after completing five years in service.

Govt. has provided 21,305 undergrads loans to purchase laptops:Minister Grero
Nearly 21,305 undergraduates have been granted the Rs 75,000 loan facility to buy laptops and the Government has so far spent Rs 112 million to settle their interests to the Peoples Bank and the Bank of Ceylon, Higher Education State Minister Mohan Lal Grero said.
He was responding to a question by Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday.
The MP queried as to the the progress on the 2016 Budgetary proposals with regard to providing WIFI facility to state universities and provisions of laptop computers for students studying in them.
The State Minister said the Budgetary proposals were being implemented under several phases, adding that the Sri Lanka Bikshu University, Buddhist and Pali University, Colombo University Indigenous Medicine Faculty, Vavuniya Campus of the Eastern University, Sri Pali Campus, Kilinochchi Engineering Faculty of the Jaffna University and Gampaha Wickramarachchi Ayurveda Institute, etc., have already been provided with the WIFI facility.
COPE Chairman submits National Audit Bill draft to Parliament
JVP MP and COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti yesterday in Parliament, submitted the draft National Audit Bill as a private Members Bill.
Deputy Secretary General Neil Iddawela accepted the Draft Bill on behalf of the Secretary General of Parliament Dhammika Dassanayake at the Parliamentary Complex.
MP Handunnetti told the media that the Draft Bill had been prepared in all three languages and that he hoped it would soon be included in the Order Book of Parliament.
The National Audit Bill is a pre-election pledge of the Government that was even included in the 100-day work programme. However, the Governments waiting game had delayed the Bill for two and half years. This is a vital piece of legislation to curb public sector corruption. As the Government is dragging its feet, we in the JVP have decided to come forward and present it to the House, Handunnetti said.
The first draft of the National Audit Bill was formulated in 2004 and ha been revised 22 times. The National Audit Commission which had been set up following the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, has been inactive for two long years due to absence of legal provisions.
Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe, convening a special press conference last month, urged the Government to gazette the drafted National Audit Bill, while observing that the inordinate delay in passing legislation had hampered the work of his Department.
The AG observed that several CAOs (Ministry Secretaries) and Ministers had reportedly objected to the surcharge provision of the Bill. The powers for surcharge means a recovery of an amount overpaid to a public servant, or a recoupment of any loss caused to the Government for which he was held responsible.
Govt. presents Note on supplementary allocations totalling Rs. 25.2 billion
To cover various additional expenses in August
The Government yesterday in Parliament, presented a Note on the Supplementary Allocations totaling to Rs 25.2 billion made to cover various additional expenses in August, which included Rs 1 billion to meet the expenditure on flood and drought relief.
It also included another Rs 3.5 billion to meet the expenditure on rehabilitation work due to disasters in May 2017 in Hambantota, Matara, Kalutara, Ratnapura, Kegalle and Galle districts.
In addition, it has also made an additional allocation of Rs 967.2 million to meet the expenditure on constructing 806 houses for flood victims in the Kalutara District as per a Cabinet decision. Another Rs 500 million had been provided to the Disaster Management Ministry to meet the expenditure of drought relief to the people who are suffering from severe drought conditions.
The Health Ministry had been provided with Rs 300 million to meet the expenditure of the National Dengue Control Programme.
It has made an additional allocation of Rs 90 million to meet the operational expenditure of the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital as per a Cabinet decision.
Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Ministry has been provided an additional allocation of Rs 36.2 million to meet the transport expenditure of MPs appointed to monitor development projects of the Government. An additional allocation of Rs 90 million had been provided for the Information Department to meet the expenditure of media publicity on the Government's development projects.
The Note of Supplementary Allocation presented to the House by the Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, also included Rs 364 million additional allocations for the Port City Development Project.
It also shows that Rs 17 million has been sought to meet a shortfall of provisions for foreign travelling of the Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development and a sum of Rs 100 million to cover the shortfall of provision for foreign travelling expenses of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Note of supplementary allocations was referred to the Public Finance Committee.
MEP Leader demands special sitting to take up NCM
MEP Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday in Parliament, demanded for a special sitting before November 9 to take up the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told the House that he had already informed the Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella to provide an early date for the NCM submitted by the Joint Opposition which had already been included in the Order Book. MP Gunawardena, observing that the Leader of the House was dragging his feet to fix a date for the NCM at the Party Leaders meetings, requested the intervention of the Speaker in this regard.
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake pointed out that the argument of Kiriella at the Party Leaders meeting was that the NCM could not be taken up as it had mentioned a file number of a court case. The Speaker consulted the Attorney General and the motion was amended according to his advice. The amended motion had been pasted on the Order Book as per the instructions of the Speaker. Therefore Kiriellas argument did not hold water. As the Budget and Constitutional Assembly sittings are approaching, the NCM could be delayed till January.
"We need the Speakers intervention to get priority for the NCM, he said.
MP Dissanayake raising a question under Standing Order 23 (2), brought the attention of the House to the drawn-out SAITM issue, adding that 8,000 medical students have been boycotting classes for a period of nine months at present.
Higher Education State Minister Mohan Lal Grero, replying to the question, said the Government expects a final and durable solution to the problem when the Supreme Court announces its verdict on the appeal relating to the SAITM issue.
The State Minister pointed out that asking to close down the SAITM as the ultimate solution was an unfair demand.
False rumours spread, protests held to mislead people: Minister Amaraweera
Hambantota protest:
There are false statements being spread regarding the incident that took place in Hambantota recently.
Protests are being held misleading the people, while there was a political agenda behind these protests, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and Mahaweli State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
He made this statement in Parliament yesterday, in response to allegations levelled by Joint Opposition MP Prasanna Ranaweera who was present in Parliament despite being further remanded in connection with the Hambantota issue.
There are false allegations spread regarding the Hambantota incident. We have so far not taken any agreement to sell the Mattala Airport.
The revenue generated by this airport is insufficient to even pay the the wages of the workers.
The Cabinet has been notified regarding the need to find an investor who would turn this airport to good use.
Under such a scenario, the Joint Opposition is trying to hoodwink the people by spreading lies and protesting.
There is a political agenda behind these protests and the effigies they burn are of me. Yet I am not the Aviation Minister nor am I the Defence Minister. There are powerful ministers who are joining us and the people are attracted towards the SLFP.
Hence they have made up this story claiming that Mattala is to be sold.
They created a situation and tried to get a person killed. I dont have such degraded politics.
The people of Hambantota are confident that Mattala would not be sold.
The people are not so gullible to believe such lies. We need to bring in investment and create more industries. We need to bring in foreign investment.
There is no benefit to anyone by revengeful acts. What we need is to engage in a mechanism that would develop this country and usher in prosperity, Minister Amaraweera said.
countries develop To day based on digital progress:Minister Ranawaka
We have lost out on three periods of industrial revolutions. Hence, we should join the fourth industrial revolution. This is the only way to progress from a mid-income country to a high income country. Countries develop based on digital progress, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
Minister Ranawaka said so in Parliament yesterday, joining the Second Reading debate on the Electronic Transactions Bill.
He said, "today the world is witnessing the fourth industrial revolution, while a vital component is digital governance. This Act is a pivotal step in that direction. People have brought about technical differences. During the past, they created an environmentally friendly development system. The first industrial revolution was known as an era that human labour was multiplied. It was America that set the stepping stone for the second industrial revolution.
With the introduction of computers, satellite technology too developed. The era of information technology commenced. Then the fourth industrial revolution began.
The dawn of the brave world dawned. Facebook lacks editors.
This is the end of the intellectual era. Now we are seeing an era that acts on emotions and not on facts and debate. Therefore states are facing a grave dilemma.
Further today, with the development of robotic technology, there would be a great revolution in the future.
The fourth industrial revolution would be one that far exceeds our comprehension. Hence, old trades and professions would be lost and new professions would arise. Hence, we need to bring governance to a new digital platform, the Minister said, initiating the debate.
''some political parties using students for their disruptive political motives'
State Higher Education Minister Mohan Lal Grero, expressed sadness over the boycotting of lectures by a few students who had become victims of several political parties who were using them for their disruptive political motives over the SAITM issue.
Grero made this statement in response to a question raised by Chief Opposition whip MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake under Standing Orders 23 (2) on the SAITM issue in Parliament yesterday.
SAITM Institute commenced in 2009 as an institution that directed students to pursue Russian degrees. Then in 2011, the University Grants Commission had given them approval to register local students.
Around 850 students were thus enrolled to pursue their education at this institute. This institution that commenced during the tenure of the previous regime and no request had been made for its close down during that time.
The government had presented many solutions to resolve the medical students issues during their protests. Some of the proposals are currently being implemented. The government had identified the student protests staged for over nine months as a grave issue. The government has also invested heavily towards the establishment of new medical faculties within the next three years. Hence, it is sad that under these circumstances when the government has taken so many positive steps, these students are engaged in boycotting classes based on the misguidance of these political parties who are using them for their political agendas.
While a considerable investment had been made towards education, those instigating these students towards such destructive behaviour and these students who have become pawns of these political parties, are to blame for this current predicament. The government however is not going to do anything that would aggravate this situation, while every possible measure would be taken to resolve this issue and bring about a solution that would be favourable to all parties involved in this issue.
Therefore, the government has made several proposals in this respect. He pointed out that demands by some parties to close down SAITM claiming that it is the only solution to resolve this issue, was nothing but a one sided solution and would not resolve the problem.
Sri Lanka heading towards knowledge based economy: Minister Harin Fernando
Is Sri Lanka heading towards a knowledge based economy by 2025 and if so, it is essential that a digital economy be implemented. Through the Electronic Transactions (Amendment) Act it paves the way to sign a foreign agreement electronically, said Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando.
He said so in Parliament yesterday, joining the debate on the Second Reading of the Electronic Transactions (Amendment) Act. The Electronic Transactions (Amendment) Act gives legal recognition for electronic signatures and facilitates the use of electronic records and electronic signatures in government institutions and statutory bodies.
We should be proud as Sri Lanka has been commended for introducing laws that have brought us to 74th place among 174 countries with the E-government concept. Among the countries that provides internet services, Sri Lanka is in the 37th place. At present, people need not run to the bank for all their transactions. Now online marketing is also in use on par with the rest of the world.
There are more mobile phones than the population. Further, over 6.2 million people use Facebook.
It is through electronic transactions that the fourth industrial revolution has emerged. By January or February, all Advanced Level students would receive a Tab, while all school children would receive computers to be used at school.
We need to progress and make things easier. We are heading towards a digital economy and we need to ensure digitalisation in our import and export sector. This Act would enable the signing of international agreements electronically. Electronic signatures would be established. We intend to provide tabs to about 7,000 Grama Sevaka officers and also equip family health workers with tabs to store their data for easy access.
Hence, we need to pave the way for a digital economy if we are to make the country a knowledge hub by 2025. This Act would be instrumental in making Sri Lanka a country with a strong economy, added Minister Harin Perera.
Govt. decides to take away private ownership of SAITM
The government has decided to take away private ownership of the Malabe Private Medical Faculty or SAITM, while it would be transformed into a non profit institution and a multi ownership institution, said State Higher Education Minister Mohan Lal Grero.
No increase in fuel prices: Dy Minister Anoma Gamage
The Government has no intention of increasing fuel prices, said Deputy Minister of Petroleum Resources Development Anoma Gamage in Parliament yesterday.
She said, Although Lanka IOC had notified the Government of their intention to increase fuel prices, I dont think they too would increase the prices fuel.
Minister Gamage was responding to a question posed by MP Lucky Jayawardena in Parliament yesterday.
She further added that currently, there were around 1,252 fuel stations across the country, while 212 have been privately owned.
She further added that of the number of fuel stations, 204 of them are currently non-operational.

Parties want new amendment included in gazette notification  : Creation of Ambagamuwa polling  division delays LG gazette notification
The delay in the publication of the Gazette notification pertaining to the upcoming Local Government election, is due to the creation of a new polling division within the Nuwara Eliya Electoral district, officials told the Daily News.
We have received a request from political parties calling on the Ministry to create and enlist Ambagamuwa as a new polling division within the Nuwara Eliya Electoral District, Provincial Council and Local Government Ministry Secretary Kamal Pathmasiri said.
We have taken these requests into consideration and have proposed several recommendations,he said.
Pathmasiri said within the Nuwara Eliya Electoral district, Ambagamuwa is densely populated with more than a 100,000 registered voters, which he said is a huge number for a single Divisional Secretariat.
There is a need to break this and since the request is from the political parties, the Ministry is considering it. Any amendment will need to be incorporated in the gazette notification, which is why there is a slight delay.
Usually a polling division would have around 50,000 voters, but since this is a congested and densely populated area, parties have made the request to create a new polling division. There are four polling divisions presently within the Nuwara Eliya electoral district, this includes Hanguranketha, Kotmale, Nuwara Eliya-Maskeliya and Walapane. According to the Census and Statistics Department, in 2012 the population of Ambagamuwa was 205,723 and had a ratio of 47.4% male and 52.6% females respectively.

Release all prisoners detained under PTA: Sampanthan
Opposition Leader R.Sampanthan yesterday in Parliament urged the Government to release all prisoners detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) without further delay.
Moving an Adjournment Motion, the Opposition Leader questioned the rationale behind detaining prisoners held under the PTA which the Government itself admits as a draconian and obnoxious piece of law.
The Sri Lankan state has made several commitments both domestically and internationally that the said law will be repealed and that a new law will be enacted in keeping with acceptable domestic and international norms. The Sri Lankan state is yet to fulfill this commitment.
he only evidence available against most of these persons is confessions extracted from them against their will under the PTA which would be inadmissible against them in a normal court of law. Almost all of them have been in custody for very long periods of time. The families of these persons have suffered very long periods of time, he said.
While also highlighting that the persons who were arrested during the JVP insurrection had been granted amnesty and released, the Opposition Leader said it is hard to understand as to why the same principle cannot be applied in regard to these prisoners.
He further pointed out that there is a political dimension to the issue of these prisoners, adding that not releasing them is a strong impediment to reconciliation and restoration of goodwill and harmony. Sampanthan also pointed out that the transfer of some cases from Vavuniya to Anuradhapura has further complicated the issue. He pointed out the transfer could deprive the accused of the opportunity of legal assistance and a fair trial. TNA MP M.A.Sumanthiran seconded the motion.

Royal baby: Duchess of Cambridge's due date announced

Britain's Prince William and his wife Catherine have revealed that their third child is due in April next year.
"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to confirm they are expecting a baby in April 2018," Kensington Palace's official Twitter feed posted on Tuesday.
Kate's pregnancy was announced by the palace last month.
At the time, she was said to be suffering fromhyperemesis gravidarum, severe levels of nausea and vomiting, a more serious health risk than the morning sickness many women suffer during early pregnancy.
The duchess was affected by the same condition during her two previous pregnancies.
The newest addition to the royal family will be William and Kate's third child, a brother or sister for Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 2.
The baby will become fifth in line to the throne, behind big sister Charlotte, bumping William's brother Prince Harry farther down the line of succession.
A change in the law after William and Kate were married in 2011 gave women the same rights of accession to the throne as men.
The child will be Queen Elizabeth's sixth great-grandchild.
The Cambridges moved back to London this year so that they can take on more royal duties on behalf of the Queen and her husbandPrince Philip.
The 96-year-old prince retired from public duties in August.
PrinceWilliam, 35, had been workingas an air ambulance helicopter pilot for the past two years. It was the first time a royal who is in direct line to the throne had taken a civilian job; he donated his salary to charity.
Since 2014, William and Kate have used Apartment 1A at Kensington Palace in London -- whichunderwent a $7.6 million overhaulin 2014 -- as their official residence.

Sexual abuse and gender-based violence is common in IDP camps and similar environments, the Sri Lankan Family Planning Association (FPA) Medical Director Dr. Harischandra Yadandawala said. He was addressing a media workshop held at the FPA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday.
Four percent of women are always pregnant in any given group of population such as the internally displaced, refugees, etc. Out of this number, 15 percent face fatal health complications, the doctor said.
According to Dr. Yakandawala, people have more sex when they are under various pressures. They have sex with their own partner or someone else and there are lot of unwanted pregnancies occurring at IDP camps etc. due to this situation.
Transmission of Sexually-Transmitted Diseases (STD) such as HIV etc. also increase at IDP camps and similar environments. Relief providers should pay special attention towards not using male workers for relief programmes and should use both male and female persons to distribute relief, he added.
When providing relief, the organizers should pay special attention towards providing sanitary pads, underwears, fully-covered places to change clothes etc. to women and children. Covered places can be created using cupboards etc. Male and female IDPs should be kept and handled separately. Separate temporary toilets, bathrooms etc. should be provided for them and 20 persons should have one toilet. One IDP should be given 20 litres of water per day, he added.

Sri Lankans are easily deceived - JVP General Secretary
It is very easy to deceive our people who are living in a big myth, JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said.
Eventhough former President Mahinda Rajapaksa pretends to be a good patriot, he was the one who sold many lands to foreigners.Our people were silent when the former President sold four acres of land in the Galle Face green to Shangri-La hotel. Although Mahinda Rajapaksa appeared to be a great Buddhist, he permitted car races in front of Sri Dalada Maligawa. He even gave a ministerial portfolio to Karuna Amman who bombed the Dalada Maligawa. Then, how can he be called a good Buddhist However, people do not accept this reality and they are living a myth. People tempted to believe politicians after they build their images.
He was addressing the gathering at the 19th annual convention of the Ceylon Teacher's Services Union held in Colombo last Friday.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena is also acting like the former President."Although he promised not to spend money for cut-outs, lots of cut-outs are displayed everywhere.There was a Vap Magul ceremony spending huge state expenses. Our people should be educated on the fact that they have been deceived.Teachers of the country can play the biggest role in this regard by making attitudinal changes of the people,"Silva said.

The UKs key inflation rate hit its highest for more than five years in September, driven up by increases in transport and food prices.
The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) climbed to 3%, a level it last reached in April 2012, and up from 2.9% in August.
The pick-up in inflation raises the likelihood of an increase in interest rates next month. The figures are significant because state pension payments from April 2018 will rise in line with Septembers CPI.
Under the triple lock guarantee, the basic state pension rises by a rate equal to Septembers CPI rate, earnings growth or 2.5%, whichever is the greatest. (BBC)

Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister Sumeda Jayasena said people at Wellawaya and suburbs were earning a good income by cultivating rose flower plants and asked youths who attempt to earn additional income to engage in the venture.
She said the country would have to import rose flowers from India if the plant was not grown here. A rose flower can be sold at Rs. 35 to 40 and it enjoys a big demand in foreign countries, the Deputy Minister said.
She said the Department of National Botanical Gardens launched a programme to encourage the flower plant cultivator and Wellawaya will be a hub for the programme. "Another was launched in the Moneragala district and cultivators would be provided with flowerpots and other necessities to improve their income," she said.
The Deputy Minister said the jobless youth could be self-employed in flower plant cultivation without being a burden to their elders. She said 3,500 flower plant cultivators were registered, but the country has about 6,500 unregistered flower plant cultivators. She said new technology would be introduced to flower plant cultivators.
She said Sri Lanka earned US dollar 13.6 in 2016 by exporting flowers.

S. A. Premalatha, a woman jailor attached to the Prisons Department with 40 years service, has returned a sum of Rs 2.4 million accidentally credited to her savings account at the Bank of Ceylon Borella branch and earned plaudits from the bank staff for her sincerity and honesty.
Two months ago, she had received a short message on her mobile phone saying a sum of Rs 1.2 million had been credited to her savings account. As she got ready to visit the bank to ascertain the source from which she had received the money, she had received another text saying a sum of Rs 1.2 million had been credited once more to her account.
Thereafter, she had paid a random visit to the bank and met the Bank Manager to check the outstanding balance in her passbook. To her bewilderment, the Manager had informed that a total sum of Rs 2.4 million had been credited to her account and asked whether she wanted to withdraw the money. Premalatha had said the money did not belong to her and that she had come to see how such a large sum of money had been credited to her account.
When the Bank Manager summoned a lady officer attached to the cash department, it transpired that the money belonging to another customer had been mistakenly credited to her account. Bank staff had been unaware of the mistake until Premalatha made inquiries about it.
S. A. Premalatha, a resident of Mulleriyawa, Angoda is a mother of three, married to a fellow jailor. She said she had not received a promotion despite her 40 years' service. She was promoted sergeant at last on the day of her retirement.
