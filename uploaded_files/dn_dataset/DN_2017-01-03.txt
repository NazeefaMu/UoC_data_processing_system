Chinese FDI to Sri Lanka still very low
Although China has been a major FDI source and lender to Sri Lanka in recent years, FDI is still very low compared to Chinese FDI to other Asian countries, said The LKI Working Paper series done by LKI Research Director, Ravindra Deyshappriya, on Sri-Lanka China Economic Relations in Comparative Perspective: Ample Room to Grow says that, similarly, although China is now the second largest source of tourists to Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka does not rank among even the top 25 outbound destinations of Chinese tourists.
While a flood of imports from China and sluggish exports to China have resulted in a dramatic trade deficit of Sri Lanka, imports from China remain vital for Sri Lankas garment industry, which drives Sri Lankan exports. This relative gap, together with Sri Lankas status as a founding member of the newly-established AIIB, indicates that Sri Lanka has potential to seek and attract more investments, grants and loans from China.
Sri Lanka is currently not even among the top 25 tourist destinations of China, although China is the fastest growing source of tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka and the share of Chinese tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka is just 0.06 percent of Chinas total outbound tourists, and it is drastically lower than the number of outbound Chinese tourists to other Asian countries.
For more beneficial economic relations, the paper recommends that Sri Lanka needs to develop new export products that are increasingly demanded in Chinese markets, and which have lower or no tariffs applied to Sri Lankan exports.

Chinese doctors bring brightness  to Sri Lankan  cataract patients
Darkness fell in Sri Lankas capital city Colombo. Kalutara General Hospital stood quietly in the cool winds after a monsoon season.
The lights in the hospitals two operating rooms remained on. Several Chinese doctors and nurses were still busy carrying out cataract surgeries for local patients.
During their one-month stay in Sri Lanka, the Chinese medical team, from the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH), has successfully completed 503 cataract surgeries, as part of their first overseas charitable mission.
It is not so easy to carry out surgery to a group of local patients in an exotic hospital and a country we are not familiar with. We need to overcome many difficulties such as hot weather, language communication barriers, and the most terrible thing -- power cut during surgery, the youngest doctor of the delegation, 35-year-old Dr. Zhao Chan told Xinhua.
Not only that, the humid air also made the equipment and machines from China not function well in the hospital.
The Chinese team provided consultations to more than 500 patients on their second day in the hospital, when a doctor-strike took place across the whole island, Zhao said. The programme was titled Brightness Action, under which the Chinese doctors helped low-income Sri Lankans to successfully recover their eyesight.
According to Zhao, the majority of patients could regain normal vision, even up to 1.0 degree only one week after surgery.
Patients queued to shake hands and pray for us, to express their thankfulness to our team, Zhao added.
All the staff ... put a lot of manpower as the workload in both the out-patient clinic and the operating room greatly increased , Zhao said.
The delegation is part of Lifeline Express, Chinas only mobile eye hospital specializing in charitable medical activities.
The medical team, which consists of eminent eye physicians from PUMCH with modern medical equipment and instruments, also offered a technical training and exchange programme introducing advanced ophthalmology surgical techniques to local doctors and nurses.
All medical services provided by Lifeline Express were free of charge.
In daily communication and exchanges, the China-Sri Lanka relations are the main topic.
Almost all Sri Lankan doctors and nurses are aware of Chinas help to Sri Lanka. The driver who is with us every day, also knows a lot about the donation projects from China to Sri Lanka, such as ports, roads and airports, Zhao said.
Cui Li, deputy director of the China National Health and Family Planning Commission, said at the opening ceremony of Brightness Action that, the Chinese medical team is undoubtedly contributing to the development of China-Sri Lanka relations.
The medical treatment carried out by Chinese Lifeline Express in Sri Lanka for the local people, not only benefits local people, also makes something meaningful for the bilateral relations between two countries, Cui said.
In July 1997, in order to celebrate the return of Hong Kong to China, Hong Kong compatriots proposed an initiative to build and donate the first China Lifeline Express to provide sight rehabilitating operations for patients with cataract. - Xinhua
Cataract
A cataract is a clouding of the eyes natural lens, which lies behind the iris and the pupil.
Cataracts are the most common cause of vision loss in people over age 40 and is the principal cause of blindness in the world. In fact, there are more cases of cataracts worldwide than there are of glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy combined, according to Prevent Blindness America (PBA).
Types of cataracts include:
A subcapsular cataract occurs at the back of the lens. People with diabetes or those taking high doses of steroid medications have a greater risk of developing a subcapsular cataract.
A nuclear cataract forms deep in the central zone (nucleus) of the lens. Nuclear cataracts usually are associated with aging.
A cortical cataract is characterised by white, wedge-like opacities that start in the periphery of the lens and work their way to the center in a spoke-like fashion. This type of cataract occurs in the lens cortex, which is the part of the lens that surrounds the central nucleus.
Cataract Symptoms and Signs
A cataract starts out small and at first has little effect on your vision. You may notice that your vision is blurred a little, like looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting.
Hazy-looking landscape.
Hazy, blurred vision may mean you have a cataract.
A cataract may make light from the sun or a lamp seem too bright or glaring. Or you may notice when you drive at night that the oncoming headlights cause more glare than before. Colours may not appear as bright as they once did.
The type of cataract you have will affect exactly which symptoms you experience and how soon they will occur. When a nuclear cataract first develops, it can bring about a temporary improvement in your near vision, called second sight.
Unfortunately, the improved vision is short-lived and will disappear as the cataract worsens. On the other hand, a subcapsular cataract may not produce any symptoms until its well-developed.
If you think you have a cataract, see an eye doctor for an exam to find out for sure.
What causes Cataracts
The lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eyes focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.
The lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it.
But as we age, some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, making it harder to see.
No one knows for sure why the eyes lens changes as we age, forming cataracts. But researchers worldwide have identified factors that may cause cataracts or are associated with cataract development. Besides advancing age, cataract risk factors include:
Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources
Diabetes
Hypertension
Obesity
Smoking
Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications
Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol
Previous eye injury or inflammation
Previous eye surgery
Hormone replacement therapy
Significant alcohol consumption
High myopia
Family history
One theory of cataract formation thats gaining favour is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This is supported by nutrition studies that show fruits and vegetables high in antioxidants may help prevent certain types of cataracts.
Cataract Prevention
Though there is significant controversy about whether cataracts can be prevented, a number of studies suggest certain nutrients and nutritional supplements may reduce your risk of cataracts.
How smoking harms your vision.
One large, 10-year study of female health professionals found that higher dietary intakes of vitamin E and the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin from food and supplements were associated with significantly decreased risks of cataract.
Good food sources of vitamin E include sunflower seeds, almonds and spinach. Good sources of lutein and zeaxanthin include spinach, kale and other green, leafy vegetables.
Other studies have shown antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin C and foods containing omega-3 fatty acids may reduce cataract risk.

Another step you can take to reduce your risk of cataracts is to wear protective sunglasses that block 100 percent of the suns UV rays when you are outdoors.

The Guru and the Disciple
The Bangladesh cricket team toured Sri Lanka in 2012-13. I was fortunate to witness the Second Test of this series played at Kettarama Stadium, with a friend of mine called Ravi who was holidaying here in Sri Lanka. Ravi and we had a friendship dating back to our College days at Ananada in the late sixties. He was and still is a diehard cricket fanatic and a wonderful photographer to boot. It was interesting to note that the journey we took from my digs at Mt Lavinia to Kettarama by bus was interesting to say the least, Ravi was so trigger happy; that even before we reached the stadium he had finished half his quota of photographs.
He was obviously fascinated by the dust, grime and squalor which pervaded the areas on that route. Once we reached the nearest bus halt to the stadium we extricated ourselves from the crowded bus and we were lucky to disembark in one piece. Ravi was fortunate to realise that his pocket was not picked in the melee.
Such was the situation that was prevalent in Sri Lanka at the time and now worse still.
By the time we reached the stadium the scenario changed completely to calm after the storm and the guru Sangakkara and the disciple Dinesh Chandimal treated us to a feast of Cricket lovely Cricket.
Kumar Sangakkara and Dinesh Chandimal soaked up two sessions of absorbing cricket at the R Premadasa Stadium, on day two of the second Test Match between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
It was a treat to watch the veteran Sangakkara shepherding young Chandimal, thus enabling Sri Lanka to get out of a rut at 60 odd runs for 4 wickets.
The pair added 195 priceless runs to the Sri Lankan cause. Sangakkara played an innings that reminds us of the old world charm, his shot selection was exquisite and he punched holes in the region between between mid wicket and mid on at will, when the Bangladeshi bowlers fell short of the mark. He also paced his innings to perfection, smothering the Bangladeshi spinners who time and again kept on pegging on a good length. His innings was all the more valuable since the track at R.Premadasa was not conducive to flamboyance, which is a hall mark of Sangakkara's batting.
Chandimal on the other hand, was the more aggressive of the two especially during the early part of the partnership.
He was never short of ideas when to score runs, at times coming out of his crease like a panther to hoist spinners over deep mid on and deep mid-off and also laying back on the back foot and steering the ball square on the off side. Already young Chandimal has scored consecutive centuries during the present Test Series with Bangladesh. He obviously has shown us that the latent talent of his, plus the runs on his score book has enabled him to come top of the pops among the young talent, which we have in abundance.
Coming back to the partnership it was noted that when Sangakkara reached his eighties he switched roles and became the aggressor playing pleasing drives through mid off and mid on to reach a well deserved century, thereby completing a third century in ten days.
This was Sangakkara's 33rd Test hundred which put him in 7th place in the all time list one behind Gavaskar and Lara.
The Guru that is Sangakkara still must be having ideas of surpassing a few milestones as he chugs along the road to stardom. As for the disciple that is Chandimal, who tends to take the bull by the horns, has the correct attitude, in my book.
After the days play, Ravi and I was observing the reactions of the crowd, a few were sloshed to their gills with beer, complete strangers were showing unusual camaraderie some were heading for places where their high spirits would end up doing the Kabaraya.
The fans of Sanga and Chandimal were seen to be in high spirits most of them losing their way to the exits in the process.
Ravi who has a fair complexion by nature was looking florid after the roasting he got from the Sri Lankan sun.
After tucking in many photographs he turned to me and said he thoroughly enjoyed the match as we passed the exit gate.

Real Estate trends in Colombo and investor preferances
As Sri Lankas fastest growing city and its capital, Colombos real estate sector has attracted the attention of investors from far and wide.
Sri Lankas property market has grown immensely since the declaration of peace and it now attracts locals, foreigners and expats alike. Leading property portal Lamudi proclaims that a number of these individuals and organisations go on to invest in the developing nations residential and commercial sector.
Luxury projects such as Altair, Shangri-La, Avic Astoria, Cinnamon Life, and many mid-range projects make Colombo a successful hub for property. Lets look at some facts and figures and examine the trends for property in Colombo.
Colombos buyers prefer houses to apartments
In general, property seekers looking to purchase in Colombo prefer purchasing houses rather than purchasing apartments. The reason for this could be that those who are only spending part of their week in the city (and who return home at weekends) are looking for a small crash pad and dont necessarily want to buy.
Those who are willing to make the commitment to buy are likely to want a larger home, and this is why houses are more popular among this type of property seeker. Many home buyers are also considering the suburbs, thanks to improved public transport networks and the expressway, making it easier than ever both to commute and to get around the city.
Most popular areas
Overseas Realty Chairman S.P.Tao with Minister Sarath Amunugama at the opening of the Havelock City commercial complex recently.
In terms of the most popular locations for home buyers, Colombo 5, 7 and 15 come out on top. This is because they have easy access to all necessary amenities. Immediate suburbs such as Dehiwala, Maharagama, Homagama, and Sri Jayawardanapura Kotte are also extremely popular.
For workers who want a crash pad apartment near the CBD, districts 3, 4, 5, 6 and 13 are much more popular, especially among those who are keen to purchase a place near the citys commercial district (which takes up districts 1-4).
Purchasing a house in the CBD is unaffordable for the majority of the population, and this is why those who buy in the CBD mostly choose a more compact space. Those who start out living in the central business district often move to a house in the suburbs once they have a family. It is also true that since the city is undergoing so much change, areas that are less popular now are likely to become more popular in the future, meaning that house prices will surely rise everywhere.
High competition for purchasing land in Colombo
Many developers and investors are keen to purchase land when they move to a new area. Buying a plot in Colombo itself is not an easy task since empty plots are quite scarce within the city itself. Thus, the demand for land is quite high both from developers and buyers all over the city. Particularly popular areas for purchasing plots include Maharagama, Dehiwala and Sri Jayawardanapura Kotte.
Mid-range properties are still the most popular
The majority of buyers and renters currently looking for property in Colombo are focused on mid-range properties. Data analysis carried out by Lamudi highlights that two and three bedroom properties are currently the most sought-after.
Prices for property in this category range between Rs. 5 Million (USD 33,334) to Rs. 25 Million (USD 166,667). However, as developments increase in number and as the country attracts increasing numbers of visitors, demand for luxury property is also increasing. Luxury apartment living is looking to become especially popular in suburbs such as Dehiwala and Battaramulla, where many potential foreign investors are keen to rent before they buy somewhere.
Rental prices in Dehiwala for a luxury apartment start between Rs. 100,000 (USD 667) and<U+2028>Rs. 150,000 (USD 1,000) per month and go up to Rs. 400,000 (USD 2,667) for the most high-end apartments.
Colombo is rapidly becoming the most exciting city to live in in this region. Investors are picking up the pace in the hope of snapping up the best properties and building on the best land. A report with all the details on trends and data for purchasing and or property in Colombo is currently available for sale.

Chosen Comedy
You have seen it all right, already. That poster with a peculiar Sinhala wording, Balloth Ekka Be (which could be loosely translated into English as Its Impossible with the Dogs), has been a familiar sight in Colombo streets with its cast staring right on to you. That peculiarity of the title has earned much wrath in the traditional Sri Lankan theatre.
Despite wrath and brickbats, the play will be heading to its 800th show on January 7 at the Lionel Wendt. Its director, Ravindra Ariyaratne, does not mind a touch of criticism. Survival is impossible, he notes, without criticism. However, there is a but for him too.
But the thing is criticism does not come from the audience. Our audience consists of intellectuals and scholars such as doctors and engineers. Some of them have watched the play quite a number of times, Ariyaratne justifies his position.
The irony is yet to come: the criticism comes from those who have not seen the play.
The reason is simple. Some of our fellow dramatists take pleasure in criticising plays of this nature. Let whatever come from whoever, but one thing is certain. We cannot take the audience for a ride. If the audience was unhappy, then we could not have come this far. Strange enough, we get to watch adaptations of Ray Cooney and Dario Fo. They are hailed as great plays. But when someone comes up with an original comedy, almost everyone in the field tends to look down at it. The adapted plays are recognised even at the state award ceremonies.
As Ravindra Ariyaratne emphasises, Ballot Ekka Be is a comedy, but not the third-class category. You would not get to see silly jokes. The humour springs from two planes: characters hiding and overlooking the trivia. The situations are twisted to create humour.
At times Ariyaratne opts to go beyond the usual theatrics to create humour out of politics and the current political crisis. Ballot Ekka Be is also a comedy production with a commercial purpose. If the traditional rules cannot be violated, there is no use of art. From time to time, Ariyaratnes team introduce fresh changes to the play. This comedy, which could also be called a political farce, has timely as well as universal themes. Ariyaratne identifies it as an example of free theatre, deeply rooted in folklore and its creative influence.
All that happens one day when a particular country holds an election to choose their next government. The politician, the main protagonist starred by Dayadewa Edirisinghe (earlier Vijaya Nandasiri), throws a grand party at his residence on the election night. But then, quite the unexpected comes to pass as the politician was losing the election big time. That makes him vulnerable to his opponents too. He decides to flee with his secretary.
But escape is not possible due to curfew declared. Walking on the road, they see a couple of statues. Left with no other option, they get into the statutes. And thats where Ariyaratnes comedy of errors takes off. While the politician and his secretary struggling silently inside the statues, a host of other characters come to the fore. A prostitute comes looking for her prey. A make-up artiste happens to stop over. A home-bound election duty officer walks into a tavern to sip a glass full of ambrosia before the day is over. And so on for two hours.
Any product and service should have a price. Theatre is no exception. Even in theatre, comedies earn more than serious plays because of the public attraction. However, in Sri Lanka theatre does not enjoy a fully privileged market as yet, Ariyaratne observes.
Ariyaratnes next attempt is Charita Horu Aran (Character Stolen), another peculiar title. He calls it a comedy of darkness based on surrealist themes. The lead character, a mayor, wakes up to forget who he is. Having forgotten everything, he walks by dreamily.
One thing the Colombans may never forget is the familiar face on the Ballot Ekka Be posters: Vijaya Nandasiri. He had been the lead actor of the play since its inception in 2009.
We really miss Vijaya Nandasiri. He was the best actor we had for comedy. It is really difficult to find someone equipped with such a skill in dialogue delivery. It is such an amazing skill. He breathes a unique meaning to the dialogue. He takes his own time to deliver the lines. That time management is bravo! But even Maname had to continue without him. So we have to continue without him, sadly. His replacement, Dayadewa Edirisinghe, is a seasoned actor with years of experience on the stage, Ariyaratne notes.
The playwright also observes that the audience behaviour matters very much in the theatre.
Sadly, the schoolchildren do not know how to enjoy a drama. It is not their fault. They have not been taught that. During our school days, we did not have a separate subject for the theatre. But we were alert when a drama group was in town. We would go to the theatre well before they start their job. Even when the drama is over, we used to go offstage and ask them various questions. But now the schoolchildren have a hectic schedule with a syllabus burdened on them to pass the exams.
Even the third ring of the bell would not stop the schoolchildrens noise in the audience. In such situations, Ariyaratne takes a few minutes to teach the audience how to enjoy theatre in silence. Following that lecture, of course, the audience is silent.
Ballot Ekka Be and Charitha Horu Aran will be staged at the Lionel Wendt Theatre on January 7 and January 8 at 7 pm.

Just chill out!
Music and acting has always been a part of his life. The nickname Thilanka Vidusha says that the nickname 'Chillie' has been his lucky charm.
His songs 'Obagen Tharam' and 'Mage Sitha Ridawa' topped the charts recently. He has also ventured into the acting arena and had acted in several movies. A few of his films are ready to be released in theaters soon. He hopes to begin work on a new movie next year and is composing a some new songs as well.
Q: What is your take on criticism
A: I have been in this field for a long span now. As artistes we get bouquets as well as brickbats. That is the nature of this profession. We too are human beings and can make mistakes. I have been praised for my work at one time. The next instance I get criticized for something. This is the price of fame. I have learnt to face such situations by now.
We too are human beings and we can become emotional when we are faced with various situations. Since we are public figures whatever we do get highlighted in the society.
Q: We hardly see you acting now.
A: There are several films due to be released. They have been on queue at theaters for some time. There are ongoing discussions for a new movie too. I am not into teledramas especially because of the time factor. That is why I am not constantly seen on screen.
Q: Describe your music style. 
A: My music is a mixture of Sri Lankan tunes and modern RnB. It used to be quite westernized when I stepped into the industry but now I have Lankanized my music a lot more to suit the modern music enthusiasts' tastes. Now it is more towards the classical side. I am a pop singer as well. 'Heena Tahataketa' became immensely popular because I moved away from my usual style.
Dancing is also a part of my act. This coupled with my singing is my success formula.
Q: What is the best and worst thing about being Chillie
A: (Laughs) There is more of the best than the worst... The best thing is that there are many people who are not known to me who love me immensely. They feel sad for me if I face some misfortune and also cry on behalf of me. I believe that they began to adore me not only because of my songs but also because of the way I behave. They would sacrifice a lot for me.
The worst thing is that you are consistently on the hot seat because you are a public figure. Since my fans love me so much they also notice my faults. They forget that I am also a normal human being like them. They keep judging me and this can be hurtful.
I am a simple human being. I have built a lifestyle which is convenient for myself. Though I engage in acting and singing I do not let these hamper my freedom. I take criticism in a positive manner and try to amend my faults.
There are also some who cannot reach the position that I am in the field today. Such people tend to act out of jealousy. Some follow me and try to be like me too. It is nice to be admired but it is best to make your own mark by absorbing the positive qualities of the people you admire. I have had idols but I am above them now.
Q: Who is your role model
A: There is no such person at the moment. I used to admire Bollyowood stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Hollywood actors like Russell Crowe, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio while I was schooling but I never tried to make myself be like them. Chilie is his own person. I do not want to become an imprint of another!
Q: Are you an outdoor person or an indoor person
A: Though I have to spend a lot of time outdoors my heart is at home with my family. I love spending whatever free time I have with them. I also love to spend time alone by myself. I would either read a book or watch a movie then. I am also a good planner. I plan everything before stepping out of the house.
Q: If you could give life to any historic character in a film, who would you like to portray
A: Gosh. That question needs some thought... (Thinking hard for a few minutes) I would love to give life to the Indian emperor Ashoka. He was one of the most powerful rulers in history but he gave it all up and took up Buddhism. That was quite a selfless act because he dedicated himself to popularizing Buddhism later. He was also a fearless warrior.
Q: What was your worst experience on stage
A: (Laughing) There are quite a few instances. I have lost my voice on stage a couple of times. I once fell on stage during an act. However such moments cannot keep me down. I was back on my feet and performing again. Since we perform at late night shows we lose sleep so all this happen due to that reason.
Q: What is your favourite and least favourite food
A: I love tasting new dishes from other countries. My favourite is the Thai cuisine. I am also a great fan of biryani. I love food but can control my appetite without any difficulties. (Laughs) I am not into sweet stuff much though.
Q: Three things you cannot do without.
A: Money, my phone and a vehicle.
Q: If you were given a chance to write your autobiography, what would the title be Why
A: Huh Oh I need to think that over... (Thinks for ages) Probably 'A Simple Man' because that is who I am. I do not like to crowd my mind with unnecessary issues. I like to chill out. I do not want to be 24 hours on the sets acting for movies or 24 hours at the studio composing music. However I do not let such characteristics hinder my journey. I make steady progress in my own pace.
Q: What is the nicest thing that someone had said about you
A: Some elderly aunts and uncles have told me that I am a very good son. Those comments really touched me.
Q: Is there something you do as a habit
A: Not really but I do hit the gym quite a lot. If I cannot make it to the gym I workout at home.
Q: What is the best advice you have gotten
A: It was given to me by my parents during my childhood. My father had advised me to face life in the best possible way I can without envying others. That has been my motto in life.
Q: Fifty years from now, how do you like to be remembered
A: I would like to be remembered as someone who has been much loved by the society. They would treat me like a hero then and as a genius in the field. I want to be known a rare character. I wish to be remembered as a very different person from all the rest even after my death.
Q: Isn't it about time you tied the knot
A: (Grinning sheepishly) I do have a fiance but I think I am not ready for marriage yet. I want to remain single for at least two or three more years.

ADB in 2016: the Year in Review

The Asian Development Bank has formulated a review on 2016 which highlights key landmarks of 2016 on a monthly basis.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) began its 50th anniversary celebrations in 2016. Over the last five decades, ADB has mobilised more than $250 billion in infrastructure, research, and knowledge sharing to expand opportunities and build prosperity across Asia and the Pacific, contributing significantly to the region's historic global rise. Yet, many challenges remain, including widespread poverty, urbanization, an aging population, and climate change. 
February 
In February, ADB President Takehiko Nakao approved the establishment of the Respectful Workplace Policy Review Working Group to reinforce respect in the workplace. 
March 
In March, ADB released the 2016 issue of the Asian Development Outlook (ADO). According to the report's findings, growth is slowing across much of developing Asia as a result of the continued weak recovery in major industrial economies and softer growth prospects for the People's Republic of China (PRC). This will combine to push growth in developing Asia for 2015 and 2016 below previous projections. 
ADB forecasts gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 5.7% in 2016 and 2017 for the region. In 2015, GDP growth was 5.9%.ADO is ADB's flagship annual economic publication.

Three new transaction advisory mandates were received to prepare and structure public-private partnership (PPP) infrastructure projects. Support continues for ADB's flagship PPP project, the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India Pipeline (TAPI).

A tumultuous year:  the 2016 global economy in 10 charts
With the Dows Trump-fuelled rally, the pounds Brexit-led tumble, golds surge and Italys high youth unemployment  the year 2016 hasnt been short of drama according to a year review by The Guradian.
They had identified 10 key points for 2016.
1 Oil prices have risen more than 50%
The price of Brent crude tumbled below $30 per barrel for the first time in 13 years at the start of 2016 as worries over a supply glut intensified. The lifting of sanctions on Iran in January meant the oil producer could ramp up crude exports into a market already awash with supplies thanks to high production from US shale oil and the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec). But prices recovered as the year progressed on signs of diminishing stocks and on growing expectations Opec would limit output. An agreement to cut supplies was reached at the end of the year between Opec and a number of non-members, sending oil to a 17-month high above $57. The price is up 54% over the year.
2. US rate rises dent gold's worth
A tumultuous year in global politics boosted demand for gold  seen as a safe haven in troubled times  and sent its price soaring for much of 2016. Appetite for gold was also boosted by low interest rates. Investors could get little or no return on cash and other assets that pay interest and so instead sought out investments such as gold. The precious metal lost some of its shine after markets digested Donald Trumps victory and the prospect of big government spending and interest rate rises in the US. As the US dollar and bond yields eased off in the final days of 2016, gold got a small fillip, ending slightly higher over the year as a whole.
3. Sterling's fall helps the FTSE
The pound has tumbled since the EU referendum, hitting 31-year lows this year. A US interest rate rise in December led the dollar to extend gains against sterling. The pound is down around 17% against the dollar since the Brexit vote. Conversely, the FTSE 100 share index has soared to record highs. Much of the FTSEs rise has been down to the pounds weakness: many of the firms listed report in dollars and so their earnings are flattered by the currency movements. The weak pound also encourages international investors to pick up UK-listed stocks and other assets such as property.
4. Dow Jones hit new highs as Wall Street welcomed Trump
The US stock index has soared to new highs in 2016, flirting with the 20,000 level. Worries about a potential wave of protectionism under president-elect Donald Trump have been more than offset by Wall Streets hopes that huge infrastructure spending and deregulation will boost the US economy  in the short-term at least. Since the election, banks have been among the top risers on US stock markets, helped by rising interest rates and expectations that Trump will relax regulations.
5. Baltic Dry's recovery points to cautious optimism on trade
The Baltic Dry index is looked to for early warning signs of trouble for the global economy. It measures dry freight costs for commodities such as coal, rice and wheat and, when it drops, economists start worrying about a slowdown in world trade and, by extension, in global economic activity. February was one such moment, when the index hit a record low of 290 points. It recovered as the year went on, with a spike in November after Trumps victory but, at 961 points, it remains well below its peak of 11,793 points in May 2008.
6. China's economy continued to slow
The year began with fresh concerns about the extent of Chinas economic slowdown, sending shockwaves through global markets. Economists expect GDP growth for the full year to come in at under 7% again and fall further next year, in a marked contrast to the expansion of 14% experienced a decade ago. The slowdown was widely expected as Chinas economy matures but the nature of its growth has worried investors. As growth falters, Beijing has turned to debt-fuelled stimulus. That government spending drive combined with soaring property prices and record bank lending has prompted warnings about Chinas debt mountain.
7. Trump's threats hammered the Mexican peso
Mexicos currency had the dubious honour of acting as a barometer for Donald Trumps chance of victory in the US presidential race. After the Republican candidate threatened to build a wall between the US and Mexico and to scrap or rejig trade deals, the peso came under repeated pressure and slumped to an all-time low against the dollar after Trumps win. More recently, the peso has steadied as Trump appears to rein in his campaign trail rhetoric but analysts warn the Mexican currency faces more volatility once the new president is inaugurated in January.
8. Japan's banking shares got a lift as central bank policy shifted
Low interest rates make it harder for banks to make a profit on the difference between the rates that are paid on savings and the rates that can be charged on loans. For evidence of what that means for banks share prices, look no further than Japan in 2016.
Japanese banking stocks were already under pressure from years of electronic money printing by the central bank and tumbled further early in the year as the Bank of Japan imposed negative interest rates on them to encourage lending to businesses. But in September, the bank changed tack from its aggressive stimulus programme and shares across the sector staged a recovery on hopes the pressure on their profitability will now ease.
9. Eurozone inflation edged up but remains way off target
The European Central Bank has taken unprecendented measures to bolster anaemic growth in the currency bloc and to push up stubbornly low inflation. Despite ultra-low interest rates and a vast programme of electronic money printing, inflation remains well off the ECB goal of below, but close to, 2%. Economists also point to core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as energy, and has stuck around just 0.8% since the summer, suggesting there is little underlying upward pressure on prices. The ECB recently announced it was curbing the amount of stimulus it provides but its president, Mario Draghi, insisted the central bank remained ready to beef up its support if inflation fails to pick up.
10. Italy and France continue to suffer from high youth unemployment
The crushing defeat for the Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi in a referendum on constitutional reform in December came amid stagnating living standards and one of the highest unemployment rates in the eurozone (pdf), at 11.6%. The situation among under-25s is worse still, with youth unemployment at more than 36%, compared with 29% five years ago. France has also experienced a rise in youth unemployment in recent years  the latest figures put it above 25%  a trend expected to influence voting patterns in the 2017 presidential election.

Theres no Spice Girls reunion set in stone
Melanie Brown has cast serious doubt that the Spice Girls reunion will take place in 2017.
In the summer, Mel confirmed that members of the chart-topping group the Spice Girls were planning to mark the 20th anniversary of their hit single Wannabe with a reunion tour. While Victoria Beckham and Melanie Chisholm decided against joining the celebrations, Geri Horner, Emma Bunton and Mel B made an announcement under the moniker GEM on their website spicegirlsgem.com, revealing they planned to thank fans with a party.
According to Britains The Sun newspaper, Geri, Mel and Emma set a tentative date to perform in Londons Hyde Park next July.
However, in a particularly tetchy interview with The Guardian, Mel admitted that there were no concrete plans.
I cant tell you anything cos nothings been set up yet, she said. Thats all up for discussion. Until weve actually got together and got a foundation of what were doing, theres nothing much to say about it really.... Theres no reunion set in stone. Until there is, theres not really much I can say about it.
Since they first proclaimed their intention to throw a party for their fans, Geri has announced that she is pregnant with her second child. Lip Sync Battle U.K. host Mel also dismissed the GEM moniker the trio previously adopted.
When asked about GEM, which is also used on the trios official website, she responded: Nooo  were still the Spice Girls. Its Geri, Emma and Melanie.... Its the press that have called it that. Were still the Spice Girls as far as were concerned.
But theres no GEM. Its you lot that have decided that. Were just us three. Thats it. Music News

Big Rumble  over a shock  political tumble
his is a script for a teledrama sitcom. The cast includes a family, the father, a leading Colombo lawyer Vijay Gansabhapathi PC, the mother Vimala, a housewife, and son Harin, a university student. A busybody next door neighbour, Rasawathie Ginipella. The Ginipella husband (not in the cast but is often referred to) and wife are portrayed as political opportunists, who sway with any favourable gust of political wind. A smaller cameo role is intended for a Mrs Gutiweera, a battered opposition activist seeking legal help from Mr. Gansabhapathi following a beating. The script, although edited because of space constraints is too long for this regular newspaper column. As such, it will be continued in the same Last Laugh column on Tuesdays.
Script: By Gaston de Rosayro
Continued from last Tuesday:
Vijay: This is quite a serious matter. If the police are refusing to take action against him then we seem to have a pretty good chance to file a Fundamental Rights Violations case.
Rasawathie: Thats why I brought Gutiweera to you. I told her you are a ferocious lawyer. Vijay Gansabhapathi PC. Presidents Counsel not Police Constable. You are not afraid of anybody. Ask her Those are the same words I told her. You are fierce like a lion. Also that you also refused various high posts they told you to come and take even though you did not work for any party. But nothing for my Gini after he is working like a dog. Thats the way with them. Very ungrateful rascals. No guney aney!
Vijay: I have already filed two petitions against this man and his cohorts for other clients. I believe this time he has gone too far. I will instruct my juniors to prepare a case in the morning. The TV coverage of the fracas will be used as evidence for the prosecution.
Vimala: Yes, this man seems to be going too far. He imagines he is above the law. He has got away with it once too often and now seems to be pushing his luck. Vijay, I think he should be put in his place. Mrs. Kehelmalla told me he is also in cahoots with the underworld.
Rasawathie: Thats the right word. Some of his thugs are like real kahuttas, thin like ekels. If you blow pfooh they will fall. But because they only have guns and knives people are keeping quiet and getting hammered.
Vimala: Why does everyone tolerate his antics
Rasawathie: You know Vimala, this Maraman Keliya is a real yakka fellow. Real gamaya. No proper education even, no manners. Not even house-trained. Dont know how to eat with fork and spoon. Cant speak English even. Pretending he knows, but you can laugh when he opens his big fat mouth. I told Gini, I will entertain anybody but not that idiot in my house! Never, never, never.
Vimala: Thats a good thing. You cant have people of that calibre walking around your home. All your decent, respectable friends and relatives will shudder at the thought of your ever entertaining such a person.
Harin: Spot on Amma. People of that calibre know only about the caliber of the weapons they carry.
Rasawathie: (Ignoring Harin and addressing Vimala) No Vimala. Never. Never. Never. I will kick his dirty shadow all the way to parliament if he comes near my door again. I told Gini dont bring him to my house and ask to give whisky and soda and cream crackers and cheese.
Harin: Aunty instead of threatening shadow boxing I think you will be doing everyone a favour if you are brave enough to give him a cracker on the ear. He certainly deserves it!
Vijay: Its really all our fault. Many among us expect to get something from these politicians. So we pander to their egos by running after them to secure favourable business deals and seek high postings. It is a malaise of the times. Ours has become a sort of sick system. Sadly, we have lost our sense of values. Frankly, we know that many of them are charlatans and crooks of the highest order milking the state coffers. Yet we make a huge hullabaloo of anointing them and entertaining them in our homes.
Rasawathie: Madness! I told you, never, never, never. If he comes again I will show the broomstick.
Harin: And you can tell him that it is your usual mode of transportation. I always easily imagine you riding a broomstick!
Rasawathie: Cheeky boy. I am sure he is meaning something dirty! Vimala, see he is saying I am riding on a broomstick. Must have learned all these val jokes from those university gamaya kollas no
Vimala: Putha, thats enough!
Harin: I cant imagine how the sons and daughters of these political chaps face up to the world. How can they go out into decent society when everyone knows what type of person their father is. As for me I might jump into a bus or three-wheeler, but I can still hold my head high, while these politicians brats whiz past me in their luxury vehicles. Truly, I am proud of my parents and am grateful for the decent values they have instilled in me.
Phone rings interrupting the conversation. Harin gets up answers and summons Rasawathie.
Harin: (Calls out to Rasawathie): Aunty. Its Uncle Gini. He says that minister Maraman Keliya will be coming over to your home in 45 minutes. He wants you to come immediately and arrange drinks and dinner. Shall I tell him that you will not sight the place and will never entertain a yakka politikka thug
Rasawathie: (Excitedly) Madness! Are you mad chile Dont, dont you tell anything. Maraman Keliya is coming to our house True ah All lies, no What to do. Must run and arrange drinks and everything.
Powerful people, no! How to tell not to come also. Bad for hospitality. Must run now and change my clothes. How to be seen like this, men Rasawathie makes a hurried exit to the door. The conversation ceases as the others look on perplexed. Ten seconds pass. Rasawathie returns suddenly, quite agitated. Turns to leave and again faces Mrs Gutiweera.
Rasawathie: (Shamefaced and with hands clasped). GutiweeraAney, please dont tell anyone I brought you here. Dont misunderstand, ah. That man Maraman will be very angry with me. You know him, no Anyway what to do We must also live. We are poor business people only. Later I will speak to Maraman and see if he is willing to give you some compensation. He is steamrolling in money.

Durdans unveils dedicated Neuro and Stroke Centre
According to the latest WHO data published, Stroke is the second leading cause of death among Sri Lankans and the leading cause of adult disability in Sri Lanka. With the population standing in at 21 million, it is predicted that by 2020, around 20% of the population in Sri Lanka will be older than 65 years of age. As stroke commonly occurs in the elderly, there is thus an impending epidemic of stroke in Sri Lanka.
When compared with the other countries in the South East Asian region, while Sri Lanka has shown a marked progress in stroke services over the last one and half decades, there is vast room for improvement of its services for needy stroke patients. The lack of organised stroke care facilities (i.e. stroke units) in public as well as private healthcare establishments is a major problem for the country at present.
Durdans Hospital remains at the forefront of cardiovascular disease treatment, stroke care and prevention in Sri Lanka. The dedicated Durdans Neuro and Stroke Centre, provides specialised care to our patients and their families. Another important part of Stroke care at Durdans Hospital, is that it involves multidisciplinary teams of neurologists, neurosurgeons, interventional radiologists, clinical nurse specialists, registered nurses, therapy and rehabilitation professionals who use multiple clinical possibilities to reduce disabilities and impairments.
We now can confidently treat stroke patients with the 24/7 coverage at Durdans Neuro and Stroke Centre said Dr. Nilaksha Kumarasinghe, Consultant Neurosurgeon at Durdans Hospital.
Durdans hospital is a premium tertiary care provider in the private sector which is equipped with all the expertise and equipment for stroke care as well as other Neurosurgical treatments including spinal procedures.
About 90% of strokes that occur in Sri Lanka are ischemic strokes, caused by an obstruction within a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain. In the absence of oxygen, the brain cells in the immediate area begin to die. Understanding risk factors and learning to recognise symptoms can potentially save lives and limit damage.
When patients come to our emergency department with stroke symptoms, they are quickly evaluated by a neurologist to determine if they are a candidate for acute therapy, added Dr. Stravinsky Perera, who is also a Consultant Neurosurgeon at Durdans Hospital.
In the past few years, we have dramatically improved our process and we now consistently treat patients with Tissue Plasminogen Activator treatment (rtPA) clot-busting medication in less than an hour from their arrival to Durdans Hospital. We have already updated our protocol so eligible patients can be treated as quickly as possible.

China central bank adviser calls for flexible 2017 growth target
The Chinese government should set a more flexible target for economic growth this year to give more space for reform efforts, a central bank adviser told the official Xinhua news agency in comments published on Sunday.
China's economy grew 6.7 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier and looks set to achieve the government's full-year forecast of 6.5-7 percent, buoyed by higher government spending, a housing boom and record bank lending.
However, growing debt and concerns about property bubbles have touched off an internal debate about whether China should tolerate slower growth in 2017 to allow more room for painful reforms aimed at reducing industrial overcapacity and indebtedness.
Huang Yiping, a monetary policy committee member of the central People's Bank of China and Peking University professor, told Xinhua that China's GDP growth target range should be 6-7 percent for this year, compared with 6.5-7 percent in 2016.
"The 6.5 percent target is just an average rate," Huang said. "As long as employment is stable, a slightly wider growth target range in the short term will reduce the need for pro-growth efforts and give policy makers more room to focus on reforms."
A Chinese steel worker helps load steel rods onto a large truck for transport at a plant on April 6, 2016 in Tangshan, Hebei province, China.
This year's growth target will determine the government's monetary policy, Huang said.
"Large-scale monetary loosening is unlikely, while the possibility of tightening cannot be ruled out," he added, citing inflation concerns, higher U.S. interest rates and a weakening yuan.
While the yuan is under pressure from U.S. interest rate rises in the short term, Huang said the yuan's exchange rate will be "largely unaffected by investors' expectations about China's economic growth," Xinhua said. As Chinese people diversify their investment portfolio, capital outflow will "last only for a certain period" in future, Huang added.
In 2016, the yuan posted its biggest annual loss against the dollar since 1994, making it the worst performing major Asian currency during the year.

Samsung Galaxy Note 7 probe results to be released this month: report
Samsung Electronics Co Ltd will announce this month the results of an investigation into what caused some of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones to catch fire, the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper reported on Monday citing unnamed sources.
The South Korean firm said in October it was examining all aspects of the phone, suggesting there may be a combination of factors that contributed to one of the costliest product safety failures in tech history.
The world's top smartphone maker warned of a $5.1 billion hit to its operating profit over three quarters following its decision to permanently halt Galaxy Note 7 sales in October.
Investors and analysts have said it is critical for Samsung to identify the root cause of the fires in order to rebuild consumer trust and avoid repeating the same mistakes.

Smartphones in 2017: where we are now and what the future holds
This past year has been great for smartphone buyers trying to spend as little as possible.
It is now quite difficult to find a smartphone with a screen resolution lower than 720x1280 even at the bottom end of the low-cost segment. Apart from that, falling manufacturing costs mean that overall quality has improved, which makes movies, games, and even pages of text look good. RAM capacities have jumped, with 2GB now the accepted minimum and 6GB not unheard of. Similarly, we now see 32GB and 64GB options at prices where 16GB would have been considered good value last year. You can also find offers of unlimited cloud storage for all your high-res photos and videos.
Unfortunately, demand and supply gaps are projected to push the cost of flash memory upwards throughout 2017, so dont expect that trend to continue. Theres also the issue of diminishing utility, as weve seen with processor speeds and core counts - things like fingerprint readers, fast charging, premium materials and camera quality will be what sets one phone apart from others at any given price level, rather than gobs of RAM and screens that are sharper than they need to be.

Volkswagen breaks ground for plant today
The ground breaking on the much publicised and long overdue Volkswagen assembly plant will break ground in Kuliyapitiya today under the patronage of the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Volkswagen AGs local joint venture partner is Senok Automobiles and the total investment will be US$ 26.5 million. Out of this US$ 21.5 million will be invested in fixed assets within a period of 24 months, the Board of Investment said.
The company will initially assemble vehicles in the 1000cc to 2000cc category and these vehicles will be diesel powered and include passenger cars, Sport Utility Vehicles (SUV), Multi Utility Vehicles (MUV) or commercial vehicles.
The agreement to assemble cars was signed by BoI Chairman Upul Jayasuriya and Senok Automombiles Chairman Noel Selvanayagam in April 2015.
The uniqueness of the project in addition to bringing investor confidence for Sri Lanka and FDIs it will also bring in advanced German automobile technology into the country and create job opportunities for the local youth.
Volkswagen, the second largest car maker in the world had strived since 2008 to start up a business to manufacture cars in Sri Lanka for export,but did not succeed for various reasons.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also earlier noted that as part of new administrations ambitious plan of creating a social market economy, it is ready to discuss such projects which will give high paying jobs to workers and raise household income levels.
Volkswagen which rose from the ashes of World War II was one of the firms that contributed to the so-called German economic miracle of the countrys social market economy.The company revenue was Euro 197 billion in 2013 and is best known for iconic models such as Beetle, Golf and Passat.
Volkswagen also announced that is to start producing cars in Kenya and Rwanda and start a ride-hailing service in Kigali, as the German carmaker expands pay-per-use transportation business models in markets where rival Uber has not gained traction.

CICT surpasses two million teu milestone in second year of operation
Colombo South Terminals incremental volumes contribute to overall growth of Port of Colombo
Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) has reported a throughput of 2 million teus for the 12 months ending December 31, 2016, achieving impressive YoY growth of 28 per cent in volume.
This new volume has enabled the Port of Colombo to register overall incremental growth in the three consecutive years since CICT came into operation, the company said.
Announcing the milestone achievement, CICT said ULCCs (Ultra Large Container Carriers) and VLCCs (Very large Container Carriers), many of a size that only the Colombo South Terminal is capable of handling, had contributed 70 percent to the volumes it achieved in 2016.
The incremental volume handled by CICT was one of the contributors to the overall throughput of the Port of Colombo growing by an estimated 11 percentin2016, the company said. The overall growth achieved by the Port of Colombo bears out the rationale for CICTs successful operation, CICT CEO Ray Ren said. CICT General Manager - Commercial and Marketing Tissa Wickramasinghe added: It must be emphasised that this historic achievement of 2 million teus was made possible mainly by the synergies developed through our parent company China Merchants Port Holdings (CMPH). The ability to access the CMPH global network was the key factor in gaining and attracting new transhipment volumes to the Port of Colombo.
With the introduction of new services and new shipping lines, CICT has set the trend for the Port of Colombo to stave off international competition for the highly sensitive and volatile transhipment cargo, in a depleted global shipping market.
In 2015, its first full year of operation, CICT 2015 handled 1.561 million teus, with the ULCC and VLCC segments making a 67% contribution to this volume.The benefit of these mega carriers calling at the port cascades down to the other terminals and reinforces Colombos status as a major transhipment hub.
Over the past two years, CICT has brought some of the largest vessels plying the Asia-Europe routes to Colombo. Of these, MSC Maya at 19,224 TEU the worlds largest container vessel, the MV Mogens Maersk (18,300 TEU), MSC New York (16,652 TEU), CMA CGM Marco Polo (16,020 TEU), YML YM Wondrous, Edith Maersk and EMC Thalassa Hellas (each 14,000 plus TEUs) and their sister vessels are now regular callers at CICT.
Besides its significant contributions to the growth of the Port of Colombo in volume terms, CICT is also responsible for several firsts in service innovation and eco-friendly operations. In early 2016, the company launched a US$ 10 million programme to convert its fleet of diesel operated rubber-tyred-gantry cranes to electricity driven rubber-tyred gantry cranes (E-RTGs) which have zero carbon emissions.
CICT was also the first terminal in the Port of Colombo to introduce electronic boat notes, breaking new ground in efforts to reduce paper in export documentation, as well as the first to launch a mobile app for the purpose of keeping track of containerised cargo at the terminal.
The concluded year also saw CICT winning the prestigious Highly Commended award in the Port Operator category at Lloyds List Middle East and Indian Subcontinent Awards, and being cited as one of the factors in its parent company - China Merchants Port Holdings (CMPH) - being adjudged Port Operator ofthe Year at the Lloyds List 2016 Global Awards.

Hence they have to take off early in the morning and have to land to while away the time; they have to land in Mattala and be grounded for three hours.We will offer a free meals for passengers while they are at the Mattala Airport.This will cost the airline and additional US$ 50 million, a source from SriLankan said.

Sri Lanka not utilising  benefits of Buddhist  philosophy: Rajitha
Former US President Bill Clinton used `meditation to heal himself having a heart disease. According to Buddhism, the developed mind can heal over 75 percent of diseases in the body, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Dr. Senaratne, the same philosophy can be used to heal all diseases.
Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie had both her breasts removed due to the danger of getting breast cancer. She made her mind up to do so using Buddhism. This is what the West and Europe see and we do not see in Buddhism, he said at a ceremony at Kaldemulla recently.
Senaratne said although dialogue on Buddhist philosophy is taking place worldwide, it is not happening in Sri Lanka. Foreigners engage in meditation programmes in the evening after work to achieve mental peace. Around 12 churches in London have closed down as more Europeans convert to Buddhism, he said.
Sri Lanka practices pure Theravada Buddhism which is a treasure. We, Sri Lankans can sell it to the world. Our Sri Lankan Buddhist Bhikkus should pay attention to this. It is much better than tourism projects.
I would have done more to promote Buddhism if I did not have bonds. I will do a complete study on Buddhist philosophy when I retire from politics, he added.

However, wildlife officers in Sigiriya refuted the claim and said the car would have been damaged badly after hitting the wild elephant crossing the road at this point since the elephant had retreated to the jungle after the incident.
The injured driver was identified as Tuan Hitley Mohamed of Kohuwala.
He had however claimed that the elephant had attacked the vehicle. Sigiriya Police investigating the incident said they had put up sign boards along this strip warning drivers to be aware of wild elephants crossing the road at night.

Recovering stolen public funds
Special Projects Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama has vowed to introduce a Bill in parliament, not only to punish those who had plundered public funds, but also to enable the government to recover the entire loot. While the Minister's pledge would no doubt be applauded by the general public, it is certainly going to be a herculean task to unravel the stolen billions, as the government has only just found out to its utter embarrassment, while attempting to unearth the hidden assets of former VIPs. Today, as is only too well known, the stolen public funds by politicians have been converted into immovable assets, lying here or abroad, in the form of luxury hotels or real estates. What should be done is to halt the flight of the stolen billions from the country.
Hence before bringing in laws to recover stolen public funds, what the Minister should do is to take measures to plug in the loopholes in the existing laws that allow the plunderers to cover their tracks sufficiently on the trail leading to the accumulated loot. It should take a leaf from Singapore in this respect.That state, as is well known, has zero tolerance for corruption and have advanced in development as a corollary. Here, in Sri Lanka, a lot of noise is made periodically on tackling corruption by politicians, but the canker continues to eat into the vitals of society as a whole.
True, what Dr. Amunugma says makes sense. Merely punishing the culprits by throwing them into prison will not bring the stolen money back into the state coffers. A mechanism should be put in place for the recovery of the plundered money, even by liquidation of the assets. But this is a long drawn out process, as seen from the Golden Key matter. Hence, a more comprehensive piece of legislation should be introduced facilitating the prompt recovery of stolen assets of the state. Today, the focus is on the public funds stolen by politicians. But all transactions where public funds have been callously frittered away should come into the equation and steps taken to recover the money from all the parties involved. Dr. Amunugama would surely have the infamous Hedging Deal as an excellent example to fall back on in his quest for introducing a law to recover public funds that were criminally flushed down the drain.
Be that as it may, today, the government has run into a virtual brick wall in its investigations into the monumental plunder of public funds carried out by the leading lights of the last regime, chiefly due to the lack of stringent laws, leaving the culprits to dare the government to even unearth a single dollar stashed away in foreign banks on pain of severing their own necks. Nay, today those charged for corrupt acts, such as money laundering, and paraded before the courts have taken upon themselves the liberty to act as heroes, brandishing their manacled wrists before the public. And indeed they are being treated as heroes, as demonstrated by their cheering supporters, conveying the message that corruption pays in this country.
What is more, the big fish, against whom serious allegations have been made, are not only breathing the air of freedom but also portraying themselves as the wronged party and pointing the accusing finger at government ministers - all because the laws are bereft of sufficient teeth to rope in the rogues. Hence, as can be seen, those who swindled public funds can afford to be smug, knowing the wheels of justice will grind, oh so slowly, if at all.
While the minister speaks of bringing laws to recover the stolen public funds there is one particular former MP, who also doubled as a Monitoring Minister, well known for his wheeler dealings involving public funds, and who for a brief period was a guest at the state run lodge, is today not only roaming about freely but is also hobnobbing with functionaries of the present government in which Dr.Amunugama is a minister. This worthy, as is now being revealed has been using public funds, running into billions, with gay abandon, with the blessings of the then rulers. What, if ever, steps will the minister take to recover these monumental sums
What has the minister got to say about one time ministers of a previous government who robbed the state but are left alone once they switch sides to the ruling dispensation Sauce of the Goose should be Sauce for the Gander. It is time that the whole issue of corruption involving state funds be tackled in earnest. Not just government ministers and officials who manipulate tenders, but the other parties involved in the transaction should be roped in and brought under the scope of the law to be introduced by the minister. A good example in this regard is the numerous unsolicited proposals accepted by the last government, without demur, where astronomical sums were paid to the powers that be as commissions. Down the line it is the public who are made to pay for the kickbacks by way of inflated costs.

Unity  in diversity
This writer believes in plural societies where there is respect for diversity which does not cause internal upheavals and wars, hence the call for secularism. What does it mean to say that we live in a secular age Secularism inhabits twin strandsone simply strives to control religion; another, more composite view, allows plural views on faith to coexist.
One understanding of secularity then is in terms of public spaces. as we function within various spheres of activity  economic, political, cultural, educational, professional, recreational  the norms and principles we follow, the deliberations we engage in, generally don't refer us to God or to any religious beliefs.
Inescapable in earlier centuries in Christendom. If we go back a few centuries in our civilisation, we see that God was present in the above sense in a whole host of social practices  not just the political  and at all levels of society. In those societies, you couldn't engage in any kind of public activity without encountering God in the above sense. But the situation is totally different today.
Secularity in this sense is a matter of the whole context of understanding in which our moral, spiritual or religious experience and search takes place.
Secular options
One view, secularism is mainly concerned with controlling religion. Its task is to define the place of religion in public life and to keep it firmly in this location. This doesnt need to involve strife or repression, provided various religious actors understand and respect these limits. But the various rules and measures which make up the secularist regime all have this basic purpose.
The other view the main point of a secularist regime is to manage the religious and -philosophical diversity of views (including non- and anti-religious views) fairly and democratically. Of course, this task will include setting certain limits to religiously motivated action in the public sphere, but it will also involve similar limits on those espousing non- or anti-religious philosophies. Religion is thus not the prime focus of secularism.
Managing diversity
Managing diversity involves a complex requirement. There is more than one good sought here. We can single out three, which we can class in the three categories of the French Revolutionary trinity: liberty, equality, fraternity. 1) No one must be forced in the domain of religion or basic belief. This is what is often defined as religious liberty, including, of course, the freedom not to believe. This is what is also described as the free exercise of religion, in the terms of the US First Amendment. 2) There must be equality between people of different faiths or basic belief; no religious outlook (religious or areligious) can enjoy a privileged status, let alone be adopted as the official view of the state. And, (3) all spiritual families must be heard, included in the ongoing process of determining what the society is about (its political identity), and how it is going to realise these goals (the exact regime of rights and privileges).
We might add a fourth goal: that we try as much as possible to maintain relations of harmony and comity between the supporters of different religions.
If we look at the three goals above, they are concerned respectively, with (1) protecting people in their belonging and/or practice of whatever outlook they choose or find themselves in; with (2) treating people equally whatever their option, and (3) giving them all a hearing.
The point of state neutrality is precise to avoid favouring or disfavouring not just religious positions, but any basic position, religious or non-religious.
If we move, however, beyond such originating contexts, and look at our situation todayat the kinds of societies we are now living in the Westthe first feature that strikes us is the wide and growing diversity, not only of religious views but also of those which involve no religion, not to speak of those which are unclassifiable.
Points to reflect
A state must not discriminate on grounds of religion in the distribution of active citizenship rights. Second, in keeping with the spirit of inter-religious equality as well as equality of citizenship, a fully secular state extends rights to minority religious groups.
Secularism is grounded in notions of equality  equal concern and respect  and therefore goes far beyond the notion of inter-religious tolerance. Respecting other religions as equals does not entail their blind acceptance or endorsement. Indeed, it is precise because respect is consistent with difference and critique that the idea of equal respect for all religions is closely linked with the proposal for an inter-faith dialogue.
We have managed respect and relations between religions fairly well. However, we have also seen the rise of religious intolerance for close over two decades in our country. The world is being torn up in some settings based on religious beliefs of the believers. We are not immune from such dangers. It is for those reasons this piece argues to look closer, for greater, consistent, informed, respectful dialogue, picking up on emerging points of conflict early and ensuring full respect for the celebration of faiths we so often see in Sri Lankan where not only do religious icons of different religions find place in one location of prayer but also where people of different faiths pray in places of worship of more than one religion. The spiritual leaders and theologians amongst them must play a sustained role in this endeavour.

Go tough with  tuk tuk!
Minister of Transport Nimal Siripala de Silva recently confirmed that a national policy is being formulated to regulate the three wheelers in the country. With more than 1.2 million three-wheelers in regular service around the country, this was a long overdue measure.
The Minister also added that series of driving regulations for three wheelers will be introduced to ensure the safety of both the passengers and road users. This is also a laudable decision since up to end November last year, 325 three-wheelers met with fatal accidents causing 348 deaths.
History
According to the All Island Three-wheeler Drivers and Owners Association President, Sudhil Jayaruk, the attempts to regulate the three-wheeler industry has a long history. The regulations regarding three-wheelers were proposed back in 1999. He adds that during the past six years, several transport authorities have suggested and made plans to make it mandatory for all hiring three- wheelers to fix mileage meters, but none of these plans has been successful.
A Motor Traffic Act with all necessary regulations for three wheelers was drafted as far back as 1998, but it was never implemented. In 2013, the Western Provincial Council gazetted its Motor Traffic Act which consisted enough regulations to control three-wheelers but none of these has been implemented.
When it came to regulating three-wheelers, the Governments-in-power during the past had not taken the initiative to go ahead with the implementation even when the related trade associations were in favour of it.
Adverse effect
Three-wheelers are considered as an appropriate mode of transport for the developing countries. Although many see the three-wheeler as the ideal escape vehicle on congested city roads, studies done by some traffic analysts have revealed that there is the serious adverse impact on lane discipline by this mode of transport.
Results of these studies emphasise the disorder caused by three-wheelers on streamline flow of vehicular traffic in congested towns and resulting unsafe situations. It also shows that it is not only bad driving practices by three-wheeler drivers, but incompatibility of the three-wheeler itself with other vehicles creates dangerous and hazardous conditions in the city traffic.
Blessings
On the other hand, other traffic analysts suggest that three-wheelers should be the preferred personal transportation mode and be encouraged in urban areas provided they run on LPG/CNG or four stroke petrol engines equipped with catalytic converters. They believe that three wheelers can play an important role as para-transit modes in most cities and therefore treat them as public transport vehicles which can easily get passengers from point to point in a hurry.
They also point out that greater use of three wheelers reduces the need for big parking places. A three wheeler just needs one parking place in the city and if it does 10 trips a day, it reduces the need for nine parking places. According to them, a three-wheeler is preferable to a car for a number of reasons. First, as compared with a car, three-wheeler can carry the same number of people on average and takes one-third of the parking area and one-half of the space on the roadway. Second, since its weight is one-third of that of a car, it is responsible for less deterioration to the road, requires less tire/rubber use, and takes one-third the national resources to produce. Therefore, three wheeler usage should be encouraged as much as possible in urban areas.
Suggestions
Whether we like it or not, three wheelers have already become a key part of Sri Lanka's public transport network. They have become important in city sector for short hauls and in urban and rural areas they transport a significant number of people to places where other forms of public transportation, such as buses or trains do not run. More importantly, they provide employment opportunities for thousands of drivers, and livelihood opportunities to even more people.
The role and importance of three-wheelers as important modes of transport in many of the Asian cities was highlighted during an event organised before the Better Air Quality workshop held in Bangkok sometime back. The discussions brought out the following recommendations:
I. Three-wheelers must be recognised as important modes of urban transport, now and in the foreseeable future.
2. In order to improve the overall system efficiency, steps need to be taken to (a) improve their operational efficiency through rationalized traffic engineering and management with particular reference to road and intersection designs, (b) revise classification of roads and vehicles for better access to mobility, (b) improve their energy efficiency and reduce pollutant emissions through progressive technological improvements, (c) improve the driver quality and efficiency through proper selection and training.
3. Three wheelers need to be promoted as the transport mode providing the last mile connectivity in the urban transport system. (Last mile connectivity is a term used in transportation planning to describe the movement of people and goods from a transportation hub to a final destination in the home.)
The workshop also recommended that the three wheelers are ideal as intermediate public transport (IPT), a feeder system for public transport in large cities. A successful public transport system with high ridership requires a good network of three wheelers.
Safety
As the Minister Nimal Siripala revealed, one of the major problems the new regulation for three-wheelers should aim to address is the commuter and public safety. Therefore, the regulation mechanism should ensure that the commuters and public are protected from undisciplined and unscrupulous drivers and that their safety is assured.
There are a number of other issues also which need attention:
(1) Electronic fare meters should be made mandatory for all three-wheelers about one and half years ago. Yet, we still come across vehicles that either do not have meters or have defunct meters that do not work.
(2) Another point requiring attention is to find out why school leavers see the three-wheeler industry as a unique sub-culture to gain employment. They choose the easy option of buying a three-wheeler on credit. Some do have even the license.
(As accidents involving three wheelers have reached an all-time high, the three wheeler community itself has been shocked to the core. In fact, they were the first to demand that three wheeler licenses should be issued only to those above 35. This proposal has been taken into consideration for the new National Policy.)
(3) While there isnt any conclusive research on how many three-wheelers had been used in criminal activities, it is estimated about 10 percent of the drivers are drug peddlers. This prompted the Dangerous Drugs Control Board to submit a proposal to the President to bring in a law limiting the issuance of three-wheeler licenses only to persons over matured age.
(4) Three-wheeler parks near road intersections cause negative effects for the road users and on the traffic flow. If a park is really necessary near intersections and if sufficient widths of the roads are available, the parking area should be at least 100 meters away from the intersection along the minor road. Municipal councils and permit issuing institutions should develop reasonable guidelines and regulations when issuing permits for locating three-wheeler parks.
(5) Most important of all, we need to discipline the three-wheeler drivers. Today they are considered as a menace to safe road traffic. There are many factors that contribute to reckless driving of three-wheelers: (a) driving without licence and insurance, (b) either not aware or show callous regard to road and traffic discipline, (c) overloading the passengers, (d) dangerously speeding and reckless driving, (e) disregard zebra crossings (j) parking at unauthorised places, (k) involvement in the transportation of illicit drugs and liquor and become facilitator for causing crimes by others. Deterrent punishments should be meted out to violators by both Police and Courts.
(6) Finally, it should be made mandatory for all three wheeler owners/drivers to be registered in an Authority recommended by Ministry of Private Transport Services. A Code of Conduct should also be prepared with the collaboration with the Three-Wheeler Associations. The Authority must be empowered to take necessary action against the violators of the Code.
For the goal of economic development, improvements in the transport sector are important and to make effective improvements, studying the transport sector is necessary. By approaching the regulation of three-wheelers from the perspective of the drivers and the public and by making a distinction between self-regulation and state regulation, an analytical study of three-wheelers will contribute to public debates on informal public transport.

Sad  sojourn  in the  Promised Land
Professional negligence is a bane to the society. Lack of proper care and attention and careless behaviour of the professionals of a country can cause calamitous situations. The electronic and print media are heavily laden with news of such situations almost on daily basis. Medical negligence tops them all. Drivers seem to have become street monsters. The inferior building materials entrap the engineers and other workers in the worksite hazards. The victims have to seek help at the court at great expense with the help of a legal eagle. The clerical system of the country keeps the innocent public in never-ending queues. The health workers are no exception. The road workers are also added to this list of culprits. The nurses sometimes are made scapegoats for physicians negligence. The general public has to bear the brunt.
The writers concern here is not any category of the public servants in the aforementioned list, but the noble profession of teaching. In the case of negligence, teaching is a silent killer. It all started when the government service succumbed to political meddling. The old generation of genuine politicians died a natural death and all kinds of miscreants took the reins of public administration. Almost all the departments and public institutions came under the direct political influence and the deterioration of the public service began. The worst types of miscreants crept into the yet noble profession of teaching and the pristine glory faded away. The half-baked politicians had a free hand of giving teaching appointments to their henchmen without having an iota of foresight and the profession destined to be doomed.
It seems a Herculean task for the incumbent minister of education to take the profession out of the treacherous bog of deterioration due to miscellaneous obstacles and bureaucratic blunders of the hierarchy. To make the situation worse, professional negligence of the teachers is raising its ugly head again in an unprecedented manner.
Lukewarm attitude of present generation
This gloomy situation could be attributed to the lukewarm attitude of the present generation to the profession. Most of the teachers seem to have forgotten the noble parametres in which they have to perform their duties. The good image of the teacher that was maintained by the teacher of the yesteryear has been eroded irreparably by the unbecoming miscreants into the professions. The constantly volatile situation of the country in every sphere of public life make the circumstances worse for the teacher to perform his divine duty to the nation. The teacher is said to have been burdened with a heavy workload that he finds it difficult to shoulder. The routine bungling of some teachers invites a bad name to the whole lot. Arrears of their salaries, long distance travelling, family burdens, social obligations,
Career advancement difficulties, political pressure at the grass root level, and heterogeneous factors contribute to the frustration of the teachers. Thus the teachers emotional wellbeing is unbalanced. The writers experience in the Maldives as a teacher compels him to mention here our counterparts there enjoy better working conditions and are in good spirits. The system there does not allow the teacher to neglect their duty. In juxtaposition, our teachers suffer a lot here, very poignantly indeed. It is the teacher who is duty-bound to mould the character of the tender child. Yet the character of some teachers is not worthy to be followed by children. Once the writer listened to a Buddhist sermon over the radio and learned a few lines that could be emulated by our teachers for the good of both teachers and students alike. They are as follows:
Wealth is lost, nothing is lost
Health is lost, something is lost
Character is lost, everything is lost.
The writer earnestly hopes that these lines would bring some insight to the teacher if they would read them. Very ironically, todays teacher is not in the habit of reading the newspaper, but wasting most of the time in gossiping and the male teachers having a fag at the school canteen and arguing on unworthy political matters to show off their wisdom to others like ZIMRIS. The vigilant child with a vacant mind observes all these behaviour patterns of the teachers very keenly, lo and behold! This ongoing situation in the sacred precincts of the school is the ugliest in the school system. The professional negligence of not being a role model teacher is very hazardous to the whole country as a whole in the long run.
Teachers wrong behaviour
This risk has to be arrested at the earliest before this noble profession further being eroded.
The evaluation procedure of the school system has to be necessarily redesigned and come under strict supervision for further improvement. The writer has many a time witnessed very wrong allocation of marks to the students on favouritism posing a direct challenge to the gifted child. It is an indelible scar in the school system passing down from generation to generation. Negligence on the part of the teacher in this regard would earn the wrath and curse of both the student community and the parent. Another matter of great importance is that some teachers are not up to the required standard to teach the subjects that are assigned to them.
Teaching English literature in schools deserves the attention of the authorities. Most of the teachers seem to not having the knowledge of the subject matter. Some teachers do grave crimes against the writers by interpreting their lines in poetry very wrongly. They not knowledgeable enough to expand on the hard titles anthologized in their syllabus and make laughable mistakes ruining the interest of the students. They fail at the examinations and the best part is that educational authority finds fault with the teachers without guiding them on the correct track. Due to lack of wide reading and experience in handling classical literature, the student suffers at the receiving end. Some of the veteran teachers even do not know the use of toward/towards specially/especially many/many a thus the students are penalised. In some cases, the students are far ahead of the teachers as the proverbial The schoolmaster is abroad tells us. Teachers, beware the writer repeats the same in capital letters in order to put you on a good pedestal to do a better job this year. Your negligence in this regard would further erode the good name you have established in the mind of the learner.
Professionalism in teaching ought to be at the helm. In this light, even the slightest blunder a teacher would do would be followed by the learner to the letter. There is a strong possibility that a child is irreparably wrecked owing to the drastic effects of a teachers wrong behaviour.
Ruin dignity of the learners
The diction used by some teachers in anger is quite inappropriate and has to be condemned in toto. They often use the names of animals to address the children. They take up the lineage of the children and ruin the dignity of the learners. A doctors negligence would kill a man, yet the gravity of the situation regarding that of the teacher is, this is killing in silence.
Wounds by words cannot be healed
It is expected at the school level, a punishment ought to be a deterrent. Yet, most of the members of the teaching fraternity take it as a privilege. In some teachers, it is a satisfaction of a sadistic desire. Miss Havisham comes to my mind. In Charles Dickens gallery of immortal characters, there is a woman by that name who kept a beautiful girl by the name Estella to break the hearts of the boys in order to revenge from men. In the tapestry of English literature, she is the most sadistic woman character for us to cite an example. In my fortyfour-year teaching career here and abroad I have observed some Havishams in angelic resemblance. The writer is in a strong view that severe punishment should come to a dead halt, yet a well-planned corrective method at the national level seems indispensable. Development of the affective domain with the cognitive skills of the child would minimise student violence, thus professional negligence in teaching would fade away to a certain extent.
There is so much to ponder on
Spare the rod and spoil the child.
Ultra active intelligence of the learners could be exploited to arrest their casual heartlessness. Ultimately their childhood pranks would be lesser. It would be a soothing balm to the school system and professionalism of the teacher would remain positive.
Luke warm attitude of the teacher towards professional ethics seems to be another stumbling block to arrest the downward trend of professional erosion in teaching. The teacher is a prominent agent of social change. The teacher is duty bound to envelop the child in a spiritual enclosure until he or she is under his or her guardianship.
It is an unavoidable professional obligation. To minimise professional negligence, a teacher should essentially adhere to it. When the child puts the best foot forward to school this year, the school should become his second home; the feeling of a home away from could be a good maxim. Annihilation of professional negligence in the sphere of teaching could propel the island nation towards the Promised Land.

Great pitched  battle
An Analysis of the Buddhist Scholarly Contribution towards the Success of Panadura Vadaya in 1873
Although the Kandy convention of 1815 said that, in its very words, The religion of Boodhoo professed by the chiefs and inhabitants of these provinces is declared inviolable and its rites, ministers and the places of worship are to be maintained and protected, with the march of time, became a dead letter. In other words, Buddhism in then current Ceylon was in great danger. The patronage, reverence and sponsorship which had been bestowed upon the Buddhist dispensation by the ancient Ceylonese kingship, was no longer existent under the British imperialism. Christianity was given the place of Buddhism to the utter regret of the Sinhalese Buddhists who were the clean majority.
In this background a legendary debate took place in 1873, commonly known as Panadura Vadaya. As Stephen Skuce puts it The controversy at Panadura or Pandura Vadaya, which had its beginnings in 1873, may be considered a cornerstone of the modern society in which we live today.
It is not a symbol of fanaticism but a land-mark in the social transition which this island has undergone. According to the available literature, the immediate reasons for the aforesaid debate in Panadura in 1873 were the publications by Rev. Daniel Gogerly and a series of sermons preached by Rev. David de Silva insulting and criticising Buddhism in public in Panadura Methodist church. Having heard this, Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda thera, being an eminent spokesman for Buddhism, took exception to those sermons and bravely challenged Rev. Silva to defend his remarks by means of an open debate.
Well attended debate
As agreed by both Buddhist and Christian parties, this Panadura Vadaya held on 26th and 28th August in 1873 in a bungalow located at Dombagahawatta in Panadura. Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda was the chief orator from Buddhist fraction and about 200 Buddhist monks are said to have graced the occasion along with several erudite Buddhist monks who were famous as Buddhist scholars both locally and internationally. Representing the Christian fraction, Rev. David de Silva, a Ceylonese Methodist minister and Rev. F S Sirimanne, an Anglican lay evangelist partook the event along with a number of Christians.
As expected by the many, this debate proceeded further without any palpable disturbances with a participation of a crowd of over 7000 in number. This debate was originally reported by a learned Christian gentleman called Mr Edward Perera by the request of John Capper, the editor of the Ceylon Times and later on, it was compiled into one booklet by J M Peebles, a traveller and a famous scholar from America, and it was distributed in Europe.
Having had the opportunity to read that text of Panadura Vadaya, Colonel Henry Olcott came to Sri Lanka in 1880 and embraced Buddhism. His arrival to Ceylon fuelled and ignited the Buddhist revival in the country and he initiated a number of progressive movements in pursuit of the guard, ward and protection of Buddhist dispensation.
The main purpose of this paper is not merely to present a detailed account of Panadura Vadaya with its general information, but to discuss several unanswered questions, in other words some points of possible controversy, giving a special attention to the Buddhist scholarly contribution towards the success of Panadura Vadaya.
It is common knowledge that debating is not an easy thing to exercise, for people who are not of a sound knowledge about the subject that they wish to debate upon. On the other hand, one should have a fairly sound knowledge about the background of ones opposition and their strengths and weaknesses as well, especially when it comes debating. As mentioned before, the most valuable human resource for the Buddhist fraction to Panadura Vadaya was Ven. Gunananda Thera. He was acclaimed as a debater of a very high order after this debate and his personality deeply affected the resurgence of Buddhism which was to follow. He was described as "the boldest, most brilliant and most powerful champion of Sinhalese Buddhism" and the leader of the Buddhist revival.
Ven. Gunananda Thera
Although he was the golden voice of the debate, it was not a feat played alone.
There was a squadron of erudite Buddhist scholars who continuously supported him behind the screen giving a great deal of confidence and encouragement by means of academic knowledge and other necessary counselling, throughout the debate.
Some of them were namely most Ven. Hikkaduwa Sri Sumangala, Ven. Weligama Sumangala, Ven. Walana Sri Siddhartha, Ven. Battaramulla Sri Subhathi, Ven. Dodanduwa Piyarathana and Ven. Rathmalane Dhammalaka etc.3. Not only that, all the other four famous debates which were held before Panadura Vadaya, namely Varagoda Vadaya (1865), Baddagama Vadaya (1865), Udamvita Vadaya (1866) and Gampola Vadaya (1871) were participated by the Buddhist debaters under the supervision and guidance of the above mentioned learned Buddhist monks.
Buddhist Pali Canon is pregnant with a large number of texts that belongs to three baskets namely Sutta, Vinaya and Abhidhamma. When we look at the sources of subject material used by Ven. Gunananda to defend Buddhism from the verbal crusade came from the Christian camp against Buddhism, we observe that, most of the time, he had referred to the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the higher teaching of the Buddha, in comparison to other sources.
As the history records it, there were no appointed judges to give the final judgement of Panadura Vadaya. However, although he was not a Buddhist, the editor of Times of Ceylon newspaper, John Capper, had been very enthusiastic towards this debate. As a result of it he had requested an English learned lawyer called Edward Perera to record the whole debate in English as accurately as possible. Although a number of people had recorded the same from both parties, it is said that nobodys recording had been as successful as the English translation of Mr Edward Perera as he did it genuinely and impartially in his level best.8 Later on Mr Capper published the entire debate in his newspaper enabling the general public to read and understand. Afterwards, having had the opportunity to read the same, it was compiled into one booklet by the famous traveller and scholar Dr J M Peebles. But as the both Buddhist and Christian parties were trying to claim victory over each other, no one was clear as to who they should call winners.
Impact on religious harmony
W J T Small, a historian of Sri Lankan Methodism, once had said The results of the debate were, from the nature of the case, inconclusive. In other words they didnt like to admit the defeat straightaway. What he had tried to elaborate was, although it was acknowledged in the eyes of the many that Buddhists had defeated the Christians, by means of the debate, Christians had the opportunity to present clearly the gospel to many thousands of Buddhists.
In that same volume, Small goes on saying that But the net result was very small, except that relations were more strained than ever.
The Christian Church continued to grow, but not as a result of the controversy. Through making the above statements what he meant was that this debating encounter did not lead to any harmonious relationship between the two religions but it made the situation worse.
Again Moscrop and Restarick, in their book Ceylon and its Methodism make a remark on Panadura Vadayaas it was a Great pitched battle. In the same volume they goes on saying about Panadura, the town where the controversy took place thus; an intensely Buddhist centre, where opposition has often become persecution, where controversy has often been bitter. By that statement they had tried to convince the society that the setting of the great debate was far more favourable to the Buddhist fraction, which didnt make any sense at all at that time in the minds of the many.
Apart from this, except few other books, the Ceylonese Christian literature had not worried too much to write on Panadura Vadaya any longer.
Since it was a decisive verbal battle fought to safeguard the Buddhism from its rivals, it is needless to say that Ven. Migettuwatte used the sharpest, most reliable and well-founded basket of the Tripitaka, the Abhidhamma, along with other sources in that feat. However the Buddha had not ever preached that Buddhism or His Dhamma is meant for debating. But the encounter that we witnessed in Panadura Vadaya exhibits that, if challenged, Buddhism can face any other theistic religion with ease.
The main reason behind the success of the Buddhism is, there is an inherent nature of Buddhas doctrine that the more it is revealed, become open, the more it shines forth and become luminous unlike some other prevailing faiths. The problem of the final judgement of Panadura Vadaya does not arise any longer, as it was, with all due respect, given by an erudite Christian scholar himself. So should we worry on that anymore Certainly not.
Apart from few references made briefly, we do not find any comprehensive and a detailed account of information from the Ceylonese Christian literature on Panadura Vadaya.

All in all, we have all the luxury to claim that it was not another sheer clash between two religious groups roused by narrow political interferences as we experience today, but a formal and philosophical debate which was highly instrumental for the remarkable revival of Buddhism in ancient Ceylon in the late ninetieth century.

Pranksters change iconic Hollywood sign to Hollyweed

US: The famed Hollywood sign high in the hills over Los Angeles got a little higher on Sunday, when someone altered two of its letters to make it read Hollyweed.
Police said unidentified thrill-seekers had climbed up and arranged tarps over the two letter Os to make them look like Es, CBS affiliate KCAL reported.
Each letter is 45 feet (13.7 meters) high, so the feat would have required not just bravado but considerable athleticism.
The daring act may have been taken in celebration of a measure approved in November, when California voters passed an amendment legalizing recreational use of marijuana.
A police spokesman said surveillance cameras might help them identify the culprit or culprits; the act was being treated as a case of misdemeanor trespassing.
It was not the first such incident since the sign was first erected in 1923 -- at the time as Hollywoodland -- to advertise a local real estate development.
Perhaps not coincidentally, the same lettering change to the sign was made exactly 41 years ago, when a California law relaxing penalties for marijuana use took effect.
That alteration turned out to be the work of a college art student, one Danny Finegood.
Along with friends, he later returned to the sign on Easter Day 1976 to make it read Holywood, and they changed it again in 1990 to read Oil War in protest of the Persian Gulf conflict.
Finegoods original handiwork, which he considered an act of environmental sculpture, was done for an art class project, the Los Angeles Times reported. Using $50 in sheets and ropes, he and three friends made the change -- and Finegood received an A from his art teacher.
But while he might have inspired the latest act of hillside mischief, Finegood cannot be blamed for it.
He died in 2007, aged 52. Largely because of his work, however, Los Angeles officials increased security around the sign, installing a fence, alarms and eventually a closed-circuit surveillance system.
It is not clear how someone made it through those barriers Sunday, but Danny Finegood might well have admired their work.

Time for adopting  community-oriented policing: IGP
IGP Pujith Jayasundara said it is time for the police to adopt a community-oriented policing. He said Sri Lanka Police had to adopt a mission oriented reactive in the war times.
The IGP also said officers should abide by the recently introduced code of ethics.
The IGP was addressing police officers at a ceremony in the Police Headquarters, Colombo yesterday morning.
In political rebellions and terrorism in the 70s and 80s, Sri Lanka Police had to change its ordinary ways of policing. We had to adapt to a mission oriented policing. But now the war ended, a great demand for a sense of freedom is coming from the public, Jayasundara said.
The police needs to adopt a humanitarian approach in operation, IGP said. He also said SL police should become an absolute professional entity thriving to create a peaceful environment for the citizens for them to live with confidence, free from crime and violence.
It is only the Sri Lanka Police that will be able to grant public wish for freedom and security, Jayasundara pointed out.
Fulfilling the demand for a free and secured society is a great challenge to us. The police is striving hard quantitatively and qualitatively to reach this goal. We are doing our level best to keep law and order and prevent all sorts of crimes and corruptions. We are to establish and strengthen a common ground to work with people. General public assistance is very important to the police, Jayasundara said.
The IGP said the police has adopted a mobile community police service wining much popularity among the public to create such a common ground.
The mobile community police service focuses on six areas: religion, culture, health, education, sports, and Sharamada service, the IGP explained. The mobile service operates in selected Grama Niladhari divisions, he said.
People want us to continue with the mobile police service. Unfortunately, it is practically impossible. We have assessed financial value of sharamadanas being carried out by the mobile police service. It is worth over Rs. 370 million, Jayasundara said.
The IGP said every police station has solved 70 percent of crimes in their respective areas. Seventy percent of property related crimes and 80 percent personal offences are solved last year, he said.
The IGP said the target for 2017 should be to solve 75 percent of reported cases.

Sixteen Army personnel including Officer In-charge of Horowpathana Army Camp were arrested and suspended from service on Saturday for inappropriate behaviour.
This was followed by a quarrel between two drunken groups who attended a Musical Show that night in Horowpathana. A security officer of the Horowpathana Army Camp was also in the incident, and he was rescued by the Officer In-charge.

It was reported that around 12 personnel from the Army Camp behaved inappropriately in front of the Horowpathana Police station on Sunday. They also had created a fuss by shooting at the sky in the town. Horowpathana Police are investigating.

Sand fly infection likely to spread island wide: Dr. Wickremasinghe
A sandfly has infected 2,500 people in the North Central Province and the Southern Province. It can be spread to other region as well, according to the Peradeniya Medical Faculty Parasitology Department Head Dr. W.D.S.J. Wickremasinghe.
He said the infection, first reported in 1992, is now rampant in the Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Hambantota, and Matara districts. This sand fly called leishmaniasis is identical to the dengue mosquito. It feeds on human blood. The skin infection it caused is difficult to cure. Although it only affects peoples skin in Sri Lanka, it had harmed peoples inner body parts in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.
Few such cases including several deaths caused by the infection were reported here as well.
Sand fly is much more difficult to be destroyed than that of dengue mosquito and the best way to safeguard is to cover the body as much as possible and use a mosquito net when sleeping.

The Uva Province cattle owners say their buffaloes are on the verge of extinction.
They say the main reasons for this is the use of modern machine for agriculture and the new generation's refusal to engage in animal husbandry.
The cattle owners further said they have very few lands for buffaloes for grazing as the lands were being filled up for constructions. Besides, some people sell buffaloes to slaughter houses, they said.
The remaining buffaloes are straying in jungles. If the curd production were started, it would help improve the situation, they said.
But still the Agriculture Department and the Uva Provincial Council have not taken any measures in helping the cattle owners.

JO to agitate against move to sell Hambantota port

The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said they would continue to agitate against a move by the government to sell a majority of shares in the Hambantota port to a Chinese company.
MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara told journalists in Colombo that the JO will launch protests as well as take legal action in this regard. He said the pending legal case in courts filed by the JO against the move by the government will bear fruit.
Nanayakkara said the government was planning to sell several other key state assets.
Nanayakkara said that if the port is incurring losses, the governments mismanagement causes it. He said the Hambantota port had a vast potential, and it was governments responsibility to harness that instead of selling it to foreign countries.
Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga in recent times refuted JO accusations saying that under the new arrangement, the port will operate as a joint Public-Private Partnership venture of Sri Lanka and Chinese investors.

India, Sri Lanka agree to set SOPs to solve fishermen issues
India and Sri Lanka agreed to a set of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to expedite the release and handing over fishermen in each others custody on completion of respective legal and procedural formalities. The SOPS was agreed at the ministerial level talks held on fishermen issues yesterday in Colombo. Indian Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Radha Mohan Singh met with Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera. The talks followed the first meeting of the Joint Working Group (JWG) on fisheries in New Delhi on December 31, 2016. The JWG, constituted in pursuance of the decision taken at the ministerial meeting in New Delhi on November 5, 2016, was co-chaired by Secretary (Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries), India and Secretary (Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development), Sri Lanka.
The ministers exchanged views on possible mechanisms to help find a permanent solution to the fishermen issues. The co-chairs of the JWG briefed the ministers on the outcome of the first JWG meeting to consider the ministers and further directions to take the process forward.
The immediate release of the fishermen presently in custody was announced following the ministerial level talks.
As part of the Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) agreed to by both sides, it was decided to intensify cooperation on patrolling and to institute periodic interaction between the Coast Guard of the two countries. An understanding was reached to ensure that there was no physical harm or loss of life while apprehending fishermen by Navy and Coast Guard of the two countries. It was agreed to explore the possibility of introducing effective tracking systems for the fishing vessels and making the use of onboard communication equipment mandatory.
The ministers appreciated the efforts taken by the JWG in operationalising the Hotline between Indian and Sri Lankan Coast Guard, which would ensure quick decision making and response.
Both sides discussed the issue of releasing fishing vessels in each others custody. The Indian side requested for the immediate release of Indian fishing vessels. The Sri Lankan side agreed to consider the request in view of the progress being made by the JWG.
The Sri Lankan side reiterated that the practice of bottom trawling needs to end at the earliest. The Indian side assured that bottom trawling would be phased out in a graded time-bound manner within a practicable timeframe keeping in mind the capacity building of the fishermen who have to be diversified into deep sea fishing as well as other coastal fisheries activities including mariculture, pearl farming and seaweed culture, among others. The Sri Lankan side was briefed about the measures already instituted including the decision to construct a new fishing harbour at Mookaiyur in the Ramanathapuram district of Tamil Nadu, and the capacity building programme for Indian fishermen on deep sea fishing that commences tomorrow at Chennai and Kochi. The next JWG meeting will be held in Colombo in April 2017 to review the progress made in addressing the fishermen issues in a comprehensive manner.

High Drama At Delimitation Committee Report Presentation: Faizer Refuses to Accept Report
Says Two Committee Members Had Not Signed:
Chairman Says Report Valid:
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha refused to accept the much- awaited Delimitation Committee report yesterday pointing out that the report had not been signed by all five members that he appointed to the Committee.
I appointed five members to the Delimitation Committee. Now two members have not signed.
I request the chairman of the Committee Asoka Peiris to inform the other two members in written form to explain the reasons for not signing it, he said.
A press conference was summoned at the Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry yesterday and the media was informed that the Delimitation Committee Chairman Asoka Peiris will hand over the report to Minister Mustapha.
However, Minister Mustapha refused to accept the report and added that he has to look into the legal provisions whether he can accept the report without the signature of two members among the five member Committee.
Peiris contradicted the statement made by the minister and added that the report can be accepted if it has been signed by a majority in the Committee.
Last Friday, all five members of the Committee decided to submit the report to the minister on Monday. However, only three members signed the report on Saturday and we decided to submit the report to the minister as the majority signed it. The other two members said that they need to go through the report again before signing it, he said.
The Delimitation Committee is headed by the former Commissioner-General of Lands, Asoka Peiris, with four other members representing political parties; the United National Partys A.S.M. Misbar, the United Peoples Freedom Alliances K. Saliya, Janatha Vimukthi Peramunas Upul Kumaraperuma and the Tamil National Alliances Professor B. Balasundarampillai.
According to Peiris, Misbar and Saliya refused to sign the report.
On a request by Minister Mustapha, Peiris also agreed to inform the members in writing.
Meanwhile, Minister Mustapha denied comments made by Peiris to a newspaper.
He said he cannot accept the report if all five members have not signed it and added that the report has been formulated sans political interference. Peiris noted that the report has been completed as mandated by the ministry.
The report is available in all three languages. There are three parts to the report; the whole report is available in the form of a book, the details of the new electorates are available with the demarcated boundaries and there is also a CD with detailed maps, he said.
Responding to a question by a journalist whether Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had discussions with Peiris, Minister Mustapha said there are no issues in the Prime Minister having
discussions with committee members.
The committee was appointed under the directions of the Prime Minister. This report is a need of the country. Therefore, there are no problems in the Prime Minister discussing it with the officers, he said.
When the minister was questioned whether the members who have not signed the report represent major political parties, he said the committee and the views of political parties they represent are two different aspects.

The Presidents vision for the Sustainable Era initiative for Sri Lanka 2030 was launched at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday.
The vision which outlined key areas that needed to be accounted for when undertaking development in Sri Lanka, seeks to develop Sri Lankas own Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in line with the 17 SDGs adopted by the UN in September 2015.
Sri Lanka as a member country signed up to the SDGs but it will be implemented in a way that it is suitable to our own country. We take the global vision and make a programme that is in line with our national policies, President Maithripala Sirisena said as he outlined his vision at the launch.
The plan for Sri Lankas SDGs however would be designed by an expert committee who will be working together with government agencies and other stakeholders draft goals Sri Lanka needs to prioritise and meet.
Prof. Mohan Munasinghe, founding chairman of the Munasinghe Institute for Development and senior advisor to the government was appointed as the first member of the expert committee.
We will ensure that the committee will be well represented by all ethnicities, experts from different subjects and would be gender equal, Prof. Munasinghe told the Daily News.
The SDGs have 17 aspirational goals with 169 targets and include ending poverty, hunger, improving health and education, making cities more sustainable, combating climate change and protecting oceans and forests. The President said in addition to making 2017 the year to alleviate poverty, Sri Lanka would also focus on food security, development and mechanisation of local industries and the introduction of modern technology to agriculture while protecting traditional practices as part of its own plan.
We will also incorporate this vision to our five and 10 year development plans and all government agencies and ministries will have this vision in their own development targets, President Sirisena said.

India will phase out bottom trawling: Amaraweera

The Indian central government has given an assurance to phase out bottom trawling within a practicable time frame, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said. He also said that the Indian Central government is focused on capacity building of the fishermen who have to be directed into optional fishing methods or new industries.
The minister was addressing the media after the second round of the bilateral discussions held between the Indian and Sri Lankan government officials.
Minister Amaraweera also said that both governments have discussed the issue of releasing fishing vessels in each others custody. The Sri Lankan government, he said, agreed to consider the request depending on the future progress of the Joint working Group
Amaraweera added that the Indian central government accepted the fact that bottom trawling is damaging to the sea bed.
The minister pointed out for the first time in the history of discussions on this issue.
We have arrested all the illegal fishing boats trespassing our boundaries so much so that our fishing harbours are filled with them. We are adamant not to allow illegal fishing in Sri Lankan waters, Minister Amaraweera said.
The Indian government has already directed 92 boats to use different fishing methods such as deep sea fishing and other coastal fishery activities such as seaweed culture, mariculture, pearl farming and so on, Minister Amaraweera said.
A joint statement was also issued after the conclusion of bilateral talks yesterday.
The joint communique is a successful outcome of the Indo-Sri Lanka bilateral talks, Minister Amaraweera said, briefing the media on the progress of discussions.
TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran, when asked about the patrolling between the Coast Guard of two countries, said that both parties are confident that joint patrolling will work when the necessary facilities are arranged.
The available resources for joint patrolling is a minimum. Sri Lanka only has around seven boats for patrolling in the concerned areas. We hope the joint patrolling to operate well, after these problems are overcome, Sumanthiran said.
A Hotline is to operate between the two Coast Guards. Asked on its purpose, MP Sumanthiran said that the communication system will prevent fishing vessels from crossing boundaries.
One Coast Guard will be able to alert the other party, when a vessel cross the boundaries. Perhaps, a Coast Guard can also signal their respective vessels that cross boundaries to turn back before they are arrested by the opposite coast guard. Sumanthiran said.
Indian Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh along with a delegation of 11 representatives participated in the discussion.
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, State Fisheries Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi, Northern Provincial Council Fisheries Minister B. Deniswaran, Uva Provincial Council Estate Infrastructure Minister Senthil Thondaman, Defense Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi, along with Fisheries Ministry and Sri Lanka Navy officials represented the Sri Lankan delegation.
The next round of discussions is to be held in Colombo in April 2017 to review the progress made in addressing the fishermen issues in a comprehensive manner.

IGP calls  for hefty traffic fines

Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara yesterday called for hefty fines and penalties to control the surge in driving offences.
Endorsing the governments decision to impose strict fines and penalties for traffic offences, the IGP said an increase in penalties and fines were mandatory to maintain road discipline and save lives. Addressing officers at the Police Headquarters during an official ceremony to commence work for the New Year, the IGP also urged his subordinates to ensure a corrupt-free and people-friendly service.
I would like to say an increase in traffic fines is a must. This traffic fine will affect only the ones who do not abide by traffic laws. Others will not be affected by these laws. It is a well known fact that all developed countries strictly implement the law to rein in errant motorists, he said. IGP Jayasundara also said that high speeding in modernised roads and careless driving have increased road accidents.
The police alone cannot regulate this situation. A dialogue on traffic issues is already taking place under the directions of President Maithripala Sirisena and Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe and the minister-in-charge. Police are a key contributor to this dialogue as well. Government officials, intellectuals, experts and the private sector are all in this dialogue as well, the IGP said.
He said the Parissamen Gihin Enna prevention awareness campaign carried out along with Rupavahini Corporation was a major success.
This term Parissamen Gihin Enna prevention awareness campaign, was very popular. It had a cultural value to it. I would like to request our officials of all ranks to adopt this term into their daily conversation with the public. It will infuse a sense of care and positive outlook when you reach the general public. We are planning on continuing with similar prevention campaign programmes together with the private sector as well, he said.
While noting that the police were responsible for the strict implementation of the law, he added that however, the police officers should remember to professionally deal with the public, speak kindly, use proper wording and be respective.
According to police reports, nearly 3,000 people have died in traffic accidents last year, making Sri Lankan roads among the most dangerous in the world.
The government recently decided to impose a Rs. 25, 000 minimum fine on seven traffic offences which prompted an island wide strike by private bus operators.

Beijing and Shanghai-bound SriLankan Airlines flights will be diverted from the Bandaranaike International Airport to the Mattala Airport starting Friday for two-and-a-half hours before continuing to China.
This situation is due to scheduling problems resulting from the closure of the BIA runway from 8:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. from this week.
Our flight to Beijing normally goes at noon, but since the runway will be closed, we have changed it to 7:35 a.m. The flight will go to Mattala and then to Beijing, and this arrangement will continue until April 6, SriLankan Airlines spokesman Deepal Perera said. The flight to Shanghai will leave
Colombo at 7:25 a.m. The Shanghai and Beijing airports are unable to accommodate our changed flight times, so we have no alternative but to divert the flights to Mattala for two-and-a-half hours, he added. Flights from Beijing and Shanghai to Colombo will not be diverted to Mattala and will arrive at BIA as scheduled.
Only flights to China will be diverted to Mattala, as other airports were able to accommodate Sri Lankan Airlines altered flight times.

Herath keeps pressure on South Africa
Cape Town: Opening batsman Dean Elgar hit a career-best century to guide South Africa out of trouble on the first day of the second Test against Sri Lanka at Newlands on Monday.
Elgar made 129 before falling to the second new ball. South Africa were 297 for six at the close after being sent in to bat.
The left-handed Elgar batted imperturbably while wickets fell at the other end, with Sri Lankas seam bowlers taking advantage of a well-grassed pitch and overcast sky.
Stephen Cook, man of the match in South Africas 206-run win in the first Test in Port Elizabeth, was out to the fourth ball of the match before a run had been scored.
Two more wickets fell to teenage fast bowler Lahiru Kumara with the total on 66 and South Africa were still struggling at 169 for five when Elgar was joined by Quinton de Kock.
Elgar and De Kock shared a 103-run partnership for the sixth wicket. With the sun coming out during the afternoon, South Africa were getting on top when Elgar pushed at a ball from Suranga Lakmal and was caught behind.
It was a rare false stroke in a 230-ball innings which included 15 fours. It was Elgars sixth Test century and two runs better than his previous highest Test score, made against Australia in Perth in November.
De Kock was unbeaten on 68 at the close. On 41, he reached 1000 Test runs in 23 innings. Only four South Africans, led by former captain Graeme Smith on 17, have reached four figures in fewer innings.
Kumara, 19, who replaced Dushmantha Chameera in one of two changes from the side that lost in Port Elizabeth, took three for 86 and bowled with pace and aggression.
Playing in only his third Test and sixth first-class game, it was the first time he had taken more than two wickets in an innings at first-class level.
His first victim was Hashim Amla, bowled between bat and pad by an in-swinger for 29. Five balls later JP Duminy gloved a legside catch to a diving wicketkeeper Kusal Mendis. Later he had Temba Bavuma caught at deep square leg.
Sri Lanka were hampered in mid-afternoon when opening bowler Nuwan Pradeep left the field with an apparent muscle injury and was unable to take the second new ball. AFP

Indian court orders removal of BCCI chief
New Delhi: Judges ordered the dismissal Monday of the Indian cricket boards president over the failure to enact a series of recommended reforms, plunging the games most powerful body into turmoil.
In a shock ruling, a panel of Supreme Court judges said Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Anurag Thakur and its number two Ajay Shirke must stand down immediately.
Thakur said he would respect the decision, while voicing bitterness at the court for siding with a retired judge who had been demanding the shake-up in the BCCIs governance.
The Supreme Court passes an order directing the BCCI president and secretary to desist from any board functions from hereon, said the ruling.
The order comes after judges slapped restrictions on the BCCIs accounts last year over its failure to implement a series of reforms recommended by a panel headed by a former top judge, Rajendra Mal Lodha.
Crickets massive popularity in India has helped the BCCI become by far the wealthiest of all of the sports national boards, netting massive money from sponsorship and TV deals.
But it has also been embroiled in a series of scandals, including accusations of corruption and match-fixing that tarnished the Indian Premier League (IPL) -- the boards lucrative Twenty20 competition.
A corruption and match-fixing scandal in the sixth edition of the IPL in 2013 brought about the downfall of the boards then-president Narayanaswami Srinivasan after his son-in-law was accused of betting on matches.
The elevation of Thakur and Shirke had been seen as representing a break with the past.
But the boards reluctance to implement Lodhas recommendations, which included age limits and term limits on office-bearers, had triggered a number of legal battles.
The recent series against England was nearly cancelled on the eve of the first Test as a result of the funding restrictions. In a video message posted on social media, Thakur indicated he would abide by the verdict while expressing bitterness at the decision.
For me, it was not a personal battle. It was a battle for the autonomy of the sports body, said Thakur, who is a lawmaker for Indias ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.
I respect the Supreme Court as any citizen should. Supreme Court judges feel that BCCI could do better under retired judges, I wish them all the best. I am sure Indian cricket will do well under their guidance.
Lodha said Thakurs removal was an inevitable consequence of the boards foot-dragging.
One should understand that when the order of the Supreme Court, which is the highest court of the land, has come, it has to be obeyed by all. It is the law of the land. Nobody can escape it, Lodha told reporters. AFP

Misbah to captain Pakistan in Sydney
SYDNEY: Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq said Monday he will lead the side in the third Test against Australia in Sydney, dismissing suggestions he is about to retire.
Misbah, 42, raised the possibility following his teams abject innings defeat in the second Melbourne Test last week to lose the series, when he said he would contemplate his future and may even retire before Tuesdays final Test.
But Pakistans most successful skipper on Monday appeared at the captains media conference before the Test to hose down speculation of his imminent retirement.
Misbah, who has scored a total of 20 runs in four innings in the series, said his comments after the innings and 18-run defeat in Melbourne were triggered by frustration.
That was 2016 -- now its 2017, he told reporters. That is gone, that is gone.
You have to fight as a sportsman and thats important for me also.
Im happy that Ive got a very good family, all the team. The way they supported me (was appreciated).
Everyone, from the support staff to the players -- and theyre up for that (fight), so Im also up. I need to play at my best. Misbah said he was not thinking about the end of his international career that started in 2001, although well-placed sources said he would make the final decision about his playing status once he returns home to Pakistan.
Misbah now concentrates only on Test cricket and retired from one-day internationals after Pakistans defeat to Australia in the World Cup quarter-final in 2015.
After the Australia Test series Pakistan do not have any Tests scheduled until April, when they will tour the West Indies for a four-match series. Misbahs most immediate assignment after the Australia series will be in the United Arab Emirates in the Pakistan Super League with Islamabad United, which starts on February 9. AFP

The Right to Disconnect and other new laws go into effect in France

PARIS  If the world does not envy the French enough already for their generous vacations, universal health care and fine food and wine, the arrival of 2017 brings this: a newly created right to disconnect.
Though ridiculed in some quarters as a ban on work-related email after hours, it is not quite that. But it is born of the enlightened view that it is actually beneficial for people not to work all the time, and that workers have the right to occasionally draw the line when their employers demands intrude on evenings at home, treasured vacations or Sundays with friends and family.
Employees are more and more connected during hours outside of the office, Myriam El Khomri, the minister of labor, said last year in justifying the need for the law.
The boundary between professional and personal life has become tenuous, and cases of burnout are becoming more prevalent, she said.
The measure is one of a raft of new laws that took effect with the beginning of the new year and that exemplify the search for compromises between preserving French traditions and making concessions to the realities of the modern world.
The new provision in the labor law does not ban work-related emails, but does require that companies with more than 50 employees negotiate a new protocol to ensure that work does not spill into days off or after-work hours.
Some consultants have recommended that employees and managers avoid the reply all function on emails to groups so that only one person is being asked to read an email and respond, rather than half the office.
Another approach recommends setting a time each evening after which employees are not expected to reply  several firms have designated the 10 hours between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m., others the 12 hours between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m.
As a country with Catholic roots, but also a commitment to personal liberties, France has had an ambivalent approach to divorce. It has long been legal, but not necessarily speedy. A new nod to modernity in French laws eases the rules for people who want to divorce.
While historically France has been far more flexible than Ireland or Italy, it still required a judge to rule on each divorce. The procedure routinely took as long as a year, and sometimes far longer, because cases were backed up awaiting the judicial signature.
Now, if both members of the couple agree on the divorce, lawyers can draw up the divorce agreement, jointly sign the papers and have them notarized. No judges need be involved.
Smoking is another area in which French habits have changed relatively little in recent years  27 to 28 percent of the population still lights up  but the country is now following many others in requiring neutral packaging for tobacco products: Instead of advertising a brand, cigarette packs sport only health warnings and photos of illnesses caused by smoking.
At least two new laws demonstrate the countrys gradual move toward more sustainable products.
Instead of thin plastic bags, French supermarkets and fruit vendors must substitute either bags made with a plant-based synthetic called amidon that is mixed with plastic, a thicker type of plastic bag that could be reused, or paper bags. At Monoprix, a supermarket chain, paper bags have won out and stacks of them perch precariously on stands at the ends of fruit counters.
More radical is the edict that went into effect on Sunday banning the use of pesticides in public gardens and along public highways. It promises to make public green spaces safer for birds and other small animals, which are especially vulnerable to the poisons used in pest killers.
It will not be easy for the gardeners employed by cities to turn to more sustainable methods. When the city of Lyon abandoned pesticides voluntarily nine years ago, it took quite some time to change the culture, although Lyon is now considered a model.
In 2019, the antipesticide law will expand to include amateur gardeners  a challenge not only for the French with backyard rows of dahlias and daisies, but also for those who nurse roses in their window boxes.
A new food-related law is sure to please the French because it plays to their immense pride in local comestibles: It allows prepared foods, like frozen dinners, to be labeled produit origine Franais only if the item is made with 100 percent French meat or milk.
Any product with more than 8 percent foreign meat must say where the animal was born, raised and butchered. A product with more than 50 percent foreign milk must say where it was collected and turned into the product being sold. It seems that the French version of Made in America is Raised in France.

Benjamin Netanyahu questioned in corruption probe

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was interrogated Monday night on suspicion of corruption in a criminal investigation authorized by the nation's attorney general.
Netanyahu is suspected of having received benefits from businessmen, according to Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld and Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit.
Netanyahu was questioned "under caution on the suspicions of receiving benefits," said Rosenfeld.
The term "under caution" refers to the questioning of someone suspected of having committed a crime, with the warning that anything they say or decline to talk about could be used against them in court proceedings.
Police and Mandelblit declined to release any further details of the three-hour questioning.
'There is nothing'
Netanyahu has repeatedly denied the allegations against him, saying they are politically motivated.
On New Year's Day, the Prime Minister posted on his Facebook page, "Unfortunately you'll have to be disappointed this time as well, like you were disappointed in previous affairs. As usual, there will not be anything because there is nothing. Try replacing the Prime Minister at the ballot box -- as is customary in a democracy."
Netanyahu was investigated by police amid allegations of fraud and breach of trust in the late 1990s during his first term. He was never indicted.
Netanyahu is in his fourth term. He has often had a combative relationship with the media, which have speculated for days about when the criminal investigation would officially begin and what it would entail.
At a holiday event in late December, Netanyahu quipped that "It's fun" to spar with Israeli journalists on social media.
Yair Lapid, a Knesset member who is one of the main political threats to Netanyahu, urged caution and a quick investigation.
"If two Prime Ministers in a row fall for corruption, it will be very difficult to rehabilitate the public's trust in government," Lapid said on Facebook, referencing Ehud Olmert, who served before Netanyahu and is now in prison for corruption. "At the same time, for the benefit of the State of Israel and the people of Israel, [the investigation] must be fast."
Investigation ongoing
Until now, the inquiry was an examination. It did not reach the level of a criminal investigation, and Netanyahu was not suspected of having committed a crime. That changed as a police car pulled into his residence on Monday night, marking the beginning of the criminal investigation.
The inquiry into Netanyahu began in mid-July, the attorney general said. But the specific accusation that led to the criminal investigation surfaced three months ago. Police investigators searched for the evidence to support the suspicion, and last month, found the evidence to warrant an investigation.
Mandelblit would not elaborate on what the suspected crime was, instead ruling out any link to investigations that have since been dismissed. Those include two issues related to the 2009 elections and primaries, and two issues related to receiving flights and benefits overseas.
Netanyahu does not have to step down if he is suspected of committing a crime. He is only required to step down if he is convicted and that conviction is upheld by Israel's high court. However, if he is indicted, he could face enormous public and political pressure to step down.
Other Israeli prime ministers have been investigated, including Ariel Sharon, Ehud Barak and Olmert.

Meteor shower Quadrantid visible in Sri Lanka tonight

The Sri Lanka Planetarium said a shower of meteors, known as the Quadrantid, would be visible in Sri Lanka around 8-9 p.m. tonight or early tomorrow (4) morning.
Sky watchers may get a good view of the meteor shower between around 4-5 a.m. tomorrow, the official further said, adding that the meteors could appear anywhere in the sky.
The Quadrantid is an above average shower, with up to 40 meteors per hour at its peak.

Mark Zuckerberg says hes no longer an atheist

For years, Mark Zuckerberg identified as an atheistat least on his profile page. But in aholiday message posted on Dec. 25, the Facebook CEO nods at a potential return to religion.
Zuckerburg wished his friends a Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah from Priscilla, Max, Beast and me!, to which one user replied Arent you an atheist
No, Zuckerberg responded. I was raised Jewish and then I went through a period where I questioned things, but now I believe religion is very important.
The Facebook founder has alluded to his spirituality in the past. During a trip to China in 2015, Zuckerberg offered a prayerfor peace and health for the world and for my family in front of Wild Goose Pagoda in Xian. Buddhism is an amazing religion and philosophy, and I have been learning more about it over time, he wrote on Facebook at the time. I hope to continue understanding the faith more deeply.
Atheism ison the risein America: According to the Pew Research Center, the number of people who identify as atheist, agnostic, or religiously unaffiliated rose to 22.8% in 2014, from 16.1% seven years earlier. Last month, the 1998 Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act, which safeguards religion minorities abroad, was amended to include Americans identifying as atheist. And in 2013, Pope Francis gavean impassioned homilyhighlighting Gods unconditional love, even the atheists.
In that same homily, Pope Francis referenced the Golden Rule: treating others as youd like to be treated. The impact people have on one another has always fascinated Zuckerberg, and was part of what drove Facebooks creation way back in 2004.
May the light of your friendships continue to brighten your life, Zuckerberg wrote at the end of his holiday message, and our entire world.
