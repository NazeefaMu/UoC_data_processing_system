A tribute to a gentleman of par excellence - Deivanayagam Eassuwaren
It is with profound sorrow that we record the demise of one of our well respected past Presidents of the National Chamber of Commerce, Deshabandu Deivanayagam Eassuwaren held in very high esteem by the Chamber, who did a yeoman service in his tenure of service to the Chamber and to the public at large. During his tenure, he brought up the concept of conducting Ayurveda Expo by the Chamber which are being continued to date by the Chamber.
Affable, gentle, kind and charming, late Eassuwaren leaves a mark of that genre of gentlemen of a past era, leaving a trail for others to follow. He was a genial head of his organization who never admonished his subordinates for any misdemeanor, but advised them gently as to their requirement.
He was a well respected and recognized Business leader amongst the business community and headed a premier Tea export Company, founded by his father, V. T. V. Deivanayagam, Eswaran Brothers, establishing their humble beginnings in 1964 with their first export of 300 chests of tea to Somalia.
He received many accolades in his lifetime including the prestigious Deshabandu National Honor Award from President Maithripala Sirisena only last year. He held many important posts - former Honorary Consul of the Republic of Mauritius, Trustee of the Varatharaja Vinayaga Temple, Former President of the Kanban Kalagam Literary Association, Trustee of the Manitha Neyam Trust among many others. He was also a philanthropist, providing facilities to less privileged schools.
A special significant quality in Eassuwaren was that, being a devout Hindu, he generously contributed to the Buddhist community and culture at large, including the construction of the 70 feet tall Samadhi Buddha statue in Rambadagalla, which is a famous landmark today, and to many other Buddhist institutions and other causes of the needy.
The large gathering of Buddhist clergy from various temples, chanting and partaking at the last rituals, was a testimony of his harmony with the Sinhala Buddhists.
We pay solemn tribute to our dear departed President, Deshabandu Deivanayagam Eassuwaren and pay silent homage to his memory.

Jan-Nov apparel exports surpasses entire 2016
Sri Lanka is reporting a surge in latest apparel exports-and so upbeat on apparel performance for Y2017, it even forecasts the overall returns for the year.
Our apparel revenues from January to November last year (2017) has exceeded Sri Lankas entire apparel exports for 2016 which was $ 4.3 billion said the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen on January 16 addressing the launch of ninth Apparel Industry Suppliers Exhibition (AISEX) 2018 by Lanka Exhibitions & Conference Services in Colombo. The latest apparel export total from January to November last year (2017) is now reported by Sri Lanka Apparel Exporters Association at a strong $ 4.36 billion. In that our apparel revenues from January to November last year (2017) has exceeded Sri Lankas entire apparel exports for 2016 which was $ 4.3 billion. Therefore we now expect that the final total apparel exports for entire 2017 would clearly exceed the exports of 2016, and expect it to be in the range of $ 4.7 billion.
Even the November 2017 monthly apparel exports of $ 406 Million is an 11% increase in comparison to November 2016s $ 364 Million said Minister Bathiudeen.
I praise Sri Lanka apparel industry and the exporters for this great performance. As you may already know Textile and Apparel are almost half of our total annual exports of all products. Our largest apparel export market is the US at around 42% followed by the EU at around 38%. What is more important is that two-thirds of the apparel workforces are women and therefore this sector is a major industry supporting the development of our female labour force. Therefore it is clear that events such as AISEX help strengthen our apparel sector in many ways.
First held in 1998, today AISEX has become a major industry event in Colombo for apparel export manufacturers and industry suppliers of Sri Lanka and abroad.
The expo is scheduled to be held in Colombo in mid-May 2018.
The two major export destinations for Lankan apparel showed a positive trend In January-November 2017.
In this period, the total apparel exports to US was $ 1.959 Bn (slightly up from 2016 Jan-Novembers $ 1.94 Bn), export to EU was at $ 1.84 Bn (up from 2016 Jan-Novembers $ 1.80 Bn).

Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha  to be remade
If there is anyone who can be dubbed as the king of good slapstick comedy, it is Mubarakan director Anees Bazmee. Famous for his films focusing on humour and having a great recall value due to the nature of its comedy, the director has made himself a place in every familys favourite film watchlist.
After his film Mubarakan starring Arjun Kapoor  Anil Kapoor in the lead roles won the hearts of his fans yet again, Bazmee has now turned his head towards another project. And this one is going to amp up the excitement level of his fans tenfold.
Ajay Devgn  Kajol starrer Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha (1998) was an iconic film when it released, and Anees Bazmee thinks it a great idea to bring the story back to the big screen, as per a report in Deccan Chronicle.
People are asking me to remake this film, and I am shocked at how even after so many years, people want to see the same story again on celluloid, Anees says.
Im proud that it was my second film which was such a huge hit. Id love to take it ahead. People want me to keep the same storyline, and I am also keen to do that. I will direct the remake, but I am looking for the right script, he adds.
However, while this project is on the cards, there is another project in line, and it will see Arjun Kapoor and Anil Kapoor reprise the roles they did this year.
I will be working with Anil and Arjun once again. I will be making Mubarakaan 2, since the film got so much appreciation. I want the two together since the film will be incomplete without the uncle and nephew duo, said Bazmee. India Today

Reports on DHF showing abnormal behaviour unfounded
Recent reports on Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) showing abnormal behaviour is unfounded, said Negombo Dengue Clinical Management Centre Clinical Head Dr. LakKumar Fernando.
Social media users recently circulated posts which stated that DHF was showing a new strain and that it affected children who showed abnormal disease behaviour, making it a challenge to detect and manage the disease.
Dr. Fernando said the pattern of the disease had not changed, but it was the norm to have diseases display unusual manifestations in a small minority of any population.
All diseases and biological events have a classical presentation that affect the majority and have somewhat unusual manifestations occurring in a small minority. Clinicians should identify these and treat accordingly to the best of their ability, he said speaking to the Daily News.
Treatment can also turn the disease to be unusual, and with the best treatment, most patients could be saved, he added further. The doctor also said the best method to avoid dengue was for the public to improve their own behaviour and protect themselves from mosquito bites, and for doctors to improve their clinical management practices, than blame the virus for unusual behaviour.

Access Engineering successfully completes and commissiones three flyovers
Access Engineering PLC, the pioneers in the flyover construction in Sri Lanka successfully completed the construction of three flyovers as a solution to lessen the heavy traffic congestion in the areas of Rajagiriya, Ganemulla and Polgahawela.
The construction works of the said flyover projects were initiated by the Road Development Authority under the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways during mid 2016 year due to the heavy traffic congestion which has long been a point of the contention among the daily commuters in the respective areas.
The projects were funded by the Government of Spain and the design and the supply of the superstructures were entrusted to; Centunion S. A of Spain as the main contractor and the design and construction of substructure, on-site fabrication, the installation and erection of the steel superstructure were subcontracted to Access Engineering PLC.
Rajagiriya town administered by the Kotte Municipal Council is situated about 10km away from the Capital of Colombo. Rajagiriya is identified as one of the heavy-traffic areas in suburbs of the City and three closely situated road intersections at Rajagiriya creates highly saturated continuous traffic congestions towards Battaramulla, Parliament road, Kalapaluwawa, Borella and Nugegoda.
More than 75,000 vehicles are plying daily through Rajagiriya inclusive of large number of public and private transport buses.
The flyover 363m length was built to accommodate four traffic lanes on two individual decks where width of a lane is 3.5m.The flyover now takes the daily commuters amassed at 4+800 km near Victoria Home up and over the flyover to the Sri Jayawardenapura Mawatha at 5+570km close to Buthgamuwa Road Junction near Fuel Filling Station. Polgahawela Railway Station is located at an important railway junction where the main railway line from Colombo branches off to Jaffna in the North, Trincomalee and Batticaloa in the East and Kandy and Badulla in the upcountry.
Around 130 trains travel to and fro through the Polgahawela rail junction necessitating continuous shunting of trains which leads to long gate closures for approximately 400 minutes per day at the level crossing located along Polgahawela - Kegalle road (A19). And this causes severe traffic congestion by the sides of the level crossing.
As a permanent solution to solve the situation at hand, an erection of a 234m long steel flyover which is comprised of 3.5m wide two lane carriageway and 1.5m wide two pedestrian ways was proposed.
The flyover was built on a six span steel superstructure of which the maximum span is of 45m length.
The approach road system comprises of 3.5m wide two-lane carriageway and 1.2m wide raised foot walks for pedestrians. The alignment of the flyover takes a detour around the existing level crossing to improve the overall road geometry while eliminating the need for extensive land acquisitions and utility re-locations.
Ganemulla Town was also recognized to be an area with high traffic congestion.
It is located 9 km away from the Kadawatha Town and is mainly developed around Ganemulla Railway Station.
The town spreads about 250m and 500m towards Kirindiwita and Kadawatha directions respectively from the railway crossing. Numerous public utilities are spread along the Kadawatha  Ganemulla (B58) road centralizing the Ganemulla Railway Station and level crossing.
Around 125 trains traveling to and fro Colombo  Badulla, Kandy, Jaffna, Trincomalee, Mannar and Batticaloa pass Ganemulla Railway Station necessitating the closure of the rail gates quiet frequently causing severe traffic congestions by the sides of the level crossings.
To remedy the situation in hand, 256m long flyover was built with 3.5m wide two lane carriageways and 1.2m wide two pedestrian ways.
The flyover is built on a pile foundations and a seven span steel superstructure. The steel components of the super structure including piers, girders and decking were imported from Spain through the main contract and were installed by the construction and engineering team at Access Engineering PLC.
All three flyovers are now completed and commissioned to public, we feel accomplished to see that all three projects come to fruition at once while contributing for better transportation, for the economy as well as for the quality of life among people in different corners of the country, said Jeewaka Dahanayake, Project Manager of all three flyover projects.

ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup:
Afghanistan seal quarter-final berth with win over Sri Lanka
WHANGAREI: Rain usually is one of the more annoying facets of this beautiful game.
But on Wednesday (17 January) at the Cobham Oval in Whangarei, it turned what seemed a regulation victory for Afghanistan into a street-fight that kept both teams interested till the end overs. Eventually, Afghanistan prevailed, winning by 32 runs on the DLS Method.
Afghanistans mammoth 284/7  thanks to half centuries from Ibrahim Zadran (86 off 112), Ikram Ali Khil (55 off 89) and Darwish Rasooli (63 off 44)  had looked beyond Sri Lanka after they lost early wickets, but when rain enforced a revision of their target to 235 off 38 overs, Sri Lanka sensed a chance.
They resumed at 114/3 in 25 overs, with Kamindu Mendis and Jehan Daniel, but the latter holed within five balls of the restart. It was a blow for Sri Lanka  having been reduced to 11/2 earlier, Daniel and Krishan Sanjula had steadied the innings with a 76-run stand. Sanjula (41) holed out off Qais Ahmed before the rain-break, and with Daniel (48) walking back as well on resumption, Sri Lanka needed something special from their captain.
He seemed very likely to provide that. With Ashen Bandara for company, Mendis made a good fist of it.
The two went after every ball, and connected with a fair few, resulting in boundaries of Mujeeb Zadran, Azmatullah Omarzai, Zahir Khan and Naveen. Zahir was even taken over the fence by Bandara, as 30 quick runs were added for the sixth wicket.
For a while, it seemed Sri Lanka could hope to sneak this one. However, given Sri Lankas enterprise, Afghanistan sensed a wicket every ball, and kept at it. The conditions  overcast, windy and slippery  didnt help matters, but Afghanistan took their chance when it came, Mendis (32) not getting much behind his pull off Omarzai that ended up with the fielder at midwicket.
Thereafter, it was a steady slide, with Omarzai scalping Bandara (38) before Naveen dismantled the tail.
He was the pick of the Afghanistan bowlers with 4/35, although there were a couple of catches dropped off him. He wont mind. Hes led the team to the quarterfinals.
Earlier, Naveen had stated his wish for a 250-plus total after being put in, admitting he had wanted to bat first anyway. Rasoolis belligerent knock in the death overs helped Afghanistan do so.
Sri Lanka had begun the day well with Thisaru Rashmika trapping Rahmanullah Gurbaz in front for a 17-ball 7 in the seventh over. Thereafter, they were pumped, with the bowlers sending in the short stuff even as the fielders threw themselves around. Zadran and Ali Khil rode the storm though, and gradually put the pressure back on the Sri Lankans with a 115-run stand for the second wicket.
Ali Khil eventually walked back when he holed out off Mendis, and Zadran followed suit four overs later after a knock that comprised five hefty sixes. Afghanistan were 172/3 in the 38th over, but Rasooli then single-handedly propelled the innings.
His long, powerful arms allowed him to thwack the ball like few can at this level. While he was in the middle, Sri Lanka were staring at a total in excess of 300, but his unfortunate dismissal  a run-out  put the breaks on Afghanistan. Nisar Wahdat looked to take charge, but holed out for a 20-ball 25, while the likes of Azmatullah Omarzai (20) and Qais Ahmed (10) ensured Sri Lanka would still need a special effort to emerge winners. They couldnt quite find that.
Sri Lankas losing captain Kamindu Mendis said: We played a good match, it was a great fight back from us. Im happy about our performance.
They got 280-odd runs, and if we could have kept them down to around 250, it would have been a good score for us to chase. Credit goes to them, they batted really well.
Our next match is against Pakistan, we hope to learn from our mistakes and win that match and go through to the semifinals. I dont think well have to change too many things. We did a lot right today. If we can change a few small things, I think itll be good for us.
A deligted Afghanistan captain Naveen ul-Haq said: It was a good game for us, it came down to the last few overs, and Im glad the boys kept their heads down and performed well.
Were now through to the quarter-finals. Well do our best in our last group match against Ireland.
Im most pleased with our batting, the way we finished the innings. We had started slowly, but our finish was quite good.
DLS usually favours the batting side, and once the score was revised, it was 50-50. But our main bowlers had some overs left, so we were quite confident.

Aluthgama riot victims compensation after LG polls
The payment of compensation to the victims of the 2014 riots in Aluthgama will be made after the completion of the Local Government elections, according to the sources at the Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry.
Speaking to the Daily News, the Media Secretary to Minister D. M. Swaminathan, said the Cabinet paper submitted by the Minister had received approval and the Treasury had approved the funds as well. The process was delayed due to the upcoming LG elections. However, he noted that as soon as the elections are over, compensation would be paid to the victims.
Houses and property of a large number of Aluthgama residents were destroyed during the violence that erupted in Aluthgama and Beruwala in 2014. Many houses and businesses were set ablaze, while others were looted or damaged.
However, the National United Front Chairman and the SLFP Colombo CMC Mayoral candidate Asath Sally told the Daily News that the victims who lost their lives in the Aluthgama riots will be paid Rs. 2 million each as compensation, while those who sustained injuries during the clashes would receive Rs. 500,000.
There were around 12 persons who either lost their lives or injured in the riots. A further Rs. 188 million has been allocated for the payment of compensation for those who suffered property damage or whose houses were completely destroyed, he noted.
The Aluthgama residents welcomed the measures taken by the government regarding the payment of compensation despite the delay. Meanwhile, Security Force Headquarters-West (SFHQ-West) of the Sri Lanka Army had previously completed 95 percent of the rebuilding and renovation of houses and businesses damaged in the riots in the Aluthgama, Beruwala, Adikarigoda and Seenawatta areas at a cost of Rs 115.3 million. In the Aluthgama area including Beruwala, Athuthgama town, Adikarigoda, Seenawatta, Darga town, Thunduwa and Walipana, the Army had restored 295 houses and 96 commercial buildings, while two mosques were also built.
The army stated that these constructions were carried out using high quality materials.

Bangladesh exports await a blow graduating from LDC
Bangladesh is likely to lose about $2.7 billion in export earnings every year once it graduates from the Least Developed Country bracket, where it has been for 43 years.
Upon graduation from the LDC status, exports will be subjected to 6.7 percent additional tariff as duty-free and quota-free benefits from different countries and trading partners will be withdrawn.
The disclosure came in a paper prepared by the Economic Relations Division on the challenges and opportunities related to transitioning from LDC.
The study comes as a United Nations panel, the Committee for Development Policy, is expected to put Bangladesh in its graduation list this year as the country meets all three criteria: Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, Human Assets Index (HAI) and Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI).
The CDP will review Bangladesh's progress in 2021, and after a three-year transition period official graduation from the LDC category will take place.
At present, Bangladesh is a major user of duty-free and quota-free market access, with shipments under this facility accounting for 72 percent of the total exports in fiscal 2015-16, the ERD report said.
Bangladesh enjoys preferential market access to more than 40 countries in varying degrees, said the Centre for Policy Dialogue in a similar study in March last year. The private think-tank came to the same conclusions as the ERD.
Regional trade agreements and bilateral initiatives cover about 90 percent of the total exports, and thus preferential market access is of special significance, the ERD report said.
Of note is the preferential treatment by the EU, where 54 percent of Bangladesh's shipments are headed. After graduation, Bangladesh's exports will face 8.7 percent tariffs, according to the CPD.
Undoubtedly upon LDC graduation, products made in Bangladesh will become more expensive to buyers and consumers in key export markets, said the ERD report that will be presented at the two-day Bangladesh Development Forum that begins in Dhaka today.
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development estimates Bangladesh's exports may decline 5.5 percent to 7.5 percent.
The preference erosion in major exporting countries will thus have implications for export competitiveness and export earnings, and consequently, GDP, employment and poverty, the CPD said.
On the one hand, we will lose some opportunities. But on the other hand, new avenues of opportunity will be opened, said ERD Secretary Kazi Shofiqul Azam at a press conference on Monday ahead of the BDF.
The ERD report recommended the commerce ministry take initiatives to make policy arrangements for exporters and manufacturers to support them during and after graduation from the LDC category.
Alongside increasing domestic resource mobilisation, the report advised the government to improve road, power, and port facilities to offset the effect of lost preferences in export markets.
Heightened efforts are necessary to diversify exports in order to reduce vulnerability of Bangladesh economy, it said.
It is not just in export markets, as the country will also be hit when it comes to foreign aid.
Concessionary financing from the International Development Association, the part of the World Bank that helps the world's poorest countries, and multilateral assistance with special benefits will also not be available upon attaining the middle-income status.
The benefit of technical cooperation and other forms of assistance such as fund support for scholarship, fellowship, participation for special training as well as for research will be pulled out.
Many of the fast-track projects under the Prime Ministers' Office such as the Matarbari Power Hub, Dhaka Metro Rail and Karnaphuli River Tunnel will require external borrowing and might not be financed from traditional concessional borrowing.
As per the WB's criteria, if the country's per capita income remains above $1,400 for three consecutive years, the rate of interest would become about 2 percent in contrast to 0.75 percent at present.
While Bangladesh has a solid track record of prudently managing its public debt and debt service payments, there is a risk that the foreign debt burden may increase due to the phasing out of the concessional facilities, the ERD report said.
Subsequently, the current strategy of prudent utilisation of concessional borrowing should be emphasised. But Finance Minister AMA Muhith at Monday's press conference dismissed such concerns.
Bangladesh's foreign aid dependence has declined substantially: it accounts for 1.3 percent of the country's gross domestic product, he said. So, there will be no problem in implementing programmes for attaining Sustainable Development Goals, Muhith said, adding that there are $37 billion of foreign loans in the pipeline. The ERD report said under-nourishment could also remain a concern after graduation. So, activities related to social developments, including health and education, should remain the core area of the development policy along with increased coverage of the social safety net programmes to address extreme poverty. Risks like high poverty and inequality, low human capital and weak economic governances have to be tackled effectively and be minimised to a reasonable level.
Emerging risks like climate change, violent extremism and managing shock and vulnerabilities like Rohingya crisis are to be managed with extreme care and attention.

Basils predictions a farce - SP Chief Minister
If the statistics put forward by former Minister Basil Rajapaksa were true and correct, Mahinda Rajapaksa should have remained President of this country to date. Basil's statistics are not only farcical, but also incorrect, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijeyalal de Silva said.
The chief minister was addressing an election meeting held at the residence of former urban council member Berty Ranasuriya in support of SLFP candidates contesting the Ambalangoda Urban Council and Pradesheeya Sabha elections recently.
Shan Wijeyalal de Silva said no one contesting an election would concede defeat until the final counting of the votes cast. During the last Presidential election campaign, former minister Basil Rajapaksa claimed that Mahinda Rajapaksa would win all districts except two. He produced statistics too to prove his claim. But what was the final outcome, de Silva asked.
The common candidate Maithripala Sirisena won the election convincingly as no one expected. Today, Basil Rajapaksa was making predictions about the forthcoming local council elections too. The people would not get misled by them because they knew that his predictions and statistics were a farce.
Although people attend political rallies in large numbers, they vote differently according to their conscience on voting day as proved at the last Presidential election. The outcome at the forthcoming election would also be the same because the UPFA was now way ahead of other parties in comparison to its showing at the start of the campaign.
President Maithripala Sirisena is a pragmatic politician who did not distinguish among people according to their party, community or social status. That was why even the majority of impartial people had joined hands with the SLFP to ensure its victory. The action taken by the President regarding the Bond issue had been acclaimed by the people, the Southern Province CM said.

Chatara grabs four as Zimbabwe edge SL
DHAKA, Wednesday: Fast bowler Tendai Chatara claimed four wickets to help Zimbabwe edge Sri Lanka by 12 runs in the second one-day international of the tri-nation tournament in Dhaka on Wednesday.
Chasing 291 for victory, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 278 in 48.1 overs despite a fighting 37-ball 64 by Thisara Perera. Opener Kusal Perera top-scored with 80.
Zimbabwe batsmen Hamilton Masakadza and Sikandar Raza set up the win with half-centuries that took the teams total to 290-6 after being put into bat first.
In reply, Thisara Perera, hitting five fours and three sixes, fought a lonely battle after Sri Lanka slipped to 181-5, but his departure spelt doom for the islanders.
Chatara, who returned impressive figures of 4-33 in 8.1 overs, ran through the Sri Lankan tail including the prized wicket of Thisara Perera.
Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews made 42 and Dinesh Chandimal added 34 runs to show some fight but Zimbabwe bowlers made regular breakthroughs to keep them in the contest.
Earlier, opener Masakadza gave Zimbabwe a solid start with his 73-run knock before middle-order batsman Raza added an unbeaten 81 off 67 balls - his second successive ODI fifty.
Raza, who hit eight fours and a six during his innings, also took one wicket after opening the attack with his off-spin bowling for Zimbabwe. He was named man of the match.
Skipper and leg-spin bowler Graeme Cremer and paceman Kyle Jarvis took two wickets each to contribute to Zimbabwes comeback win after losing the opener to Bangladesh.
It was Zimbabwes fourth win over Sri Lanka in their last six matches. Sri Lanka now face hosts Bangladesh in the third ODI in Dhaka on Friday. AFP

COAL POWER PLANTS - A CORRECT DECISION
It is gratifying to read that Minister Sarath Amunugama has taken charge of the policy decision regarding the use of coal for electric power generation. There seems to be feverish activity by the anti-coal lobby led by Eng Parakrama Jayasinghe, Dr Ranil Senanayake and Dr Janaka Ratnasiri to scuttle this wise move.
What I would like to point out is that at last Sri Lanka is aligning itself to what nearly every country in the region is doing. Which is going for the coal option to ensure dependable electricity production Our neighbour India already has over 500 coal fueled plants and plans to add 486 more.
India which is also a signatory of the Paris Climate Change Protocol is reneging on compliance and adding coal power plants, not LNG. The Chairman of Indian Electricity Board Verna, said my first priority is to supply electric power to the people, justifying his decision to go ahead with 486 new coal plants in addition to existing 559.
His claims that the CEB has gone out against the Coal Option is also false as clearly stated by G A D Srimal.
Our neighbour Tamil Nadu generates nearly 10,000 MW of Coal-fired Electric Power. I could not find a single new LNG Plant.
And now Dr Janaka Ratnasiri writes that we are in the Bullock cartage if we resort to coal power as opposed to LNG.

The citronella oil industry in Hambantota district that brought a colossal sum of money to the country in the form of foreign exchange is facing a deep crisis now. A bottle of citronella oil that fetched Rs.7,500 in the recent past now fetches a price of Rs.1,500 only.
The small scale citronella growers and citronella oil industrialists said that 700 kilograms of citronella leaves are necessary to distill eight bottles of citronella oil.
According to a citronella oil distiller at Katuwana, a loan of Rs one lakh was disbursed to women who engage in the citronella oil industry when a bottle of citronella oil fetched a price of Rs. 7,500. These women are now indebted to banks and other lending institutions due to the deep crisis in the citronella oil industry.

CONSERVING THE FLYING MAMMALS
Aimed at wildlife enthusiasts and those interested in conservation, A Field Guide to the Bats of Sri Lanka is the 13th segment of the Dilmah Conservations Field Guides Series. The culmination of three decades of research and study by Prof. Wipula Bandara Yapa, this field guide delivers an all-encompassing view of the 30 species of bats known to inhabit Sri Lanka. Coupled with vibrant photographs and precise illustrations that enable the easy distinction between the species, this guide is comprehensible and invites the reader to sample its pages.
title: A Field Guide to the Bats of Sri Lankaauthour: Prof. Wipula Bandara Yapa
Identified as pests that terrorize gardens and fields, bats are not the most favoured mammals in Sri Lanka. They are the second largest mammalian order in number of species and exceed other groups in overall abundance, as presented in the field guide. Through the publication of this book, Dilmah Conservation hopes cultivate an interest in the flying foxes among the youth of Sri Lanka and inspire them towards the conservation of these airborne mammals.
Authored by the Prof. Wipula Bandara Yapa, a leading chiropterologistwho heads the Zoology Department at the University of Colombo, this field guide is systematically divided into four descriptive sections titled Introduction and Evolution, Diversity Habits and Habitats, Conservation and Importance of Bats and Bats of Sri Lanka.
Introduction and Evolution
This section first gives a brief introduction to Bats, describing two of their specialized features that set them apart from other mammalian species and birds  echolocation and their capability of sustained flight. It then moves on to give a concise analysis into their evolution which began about 50 million years ago. Delving into the historical evolution of the species, the use of complex terms requires some sort of familiarity with scientific terminology for complete understanding. While useful for those who wish to truly understand the evolution of bats over the years, it is likely to be skimmed over by those not well versed in science, osteology and palaeontology.
This section also functions as a guide to the classification of the diverse species of bats and focuses more on the identification of bats based on familial interconnections and molecular phylogeny. This section again is for the more intense enthusiasts who are accustomed to scientific diction.
Diversity, Habits and Habitats
This section of the guide comments on the morphological diversity of the species discussing body size, wing span and colour and even presents illustrations through which to identify different tail, nose and ear structures.
It then describes the reproduction and social lives of the species drawing attention to the general gregarious nature of bats. Not unlike humans, they too exist in congregations  some of which exceed several millions of individuals as presented in the field guide with the mother and her pup as the basic social unit. This part of the guide is informative, providing details into the social organization and reproductive specializations. The pictorial representations of the mother carrying its young and the nursery colony are quite effective. The roosting habits and habitats of bats too are represented in this section showcasing the adaptability of bats to roost in diverse locations from tunnels to trees to houses. The use of graphs to explain the adaptation to fluctuations in humidity and temperature are presented clearly and show how different species are able to coexist. The activity patterns of bats are represented via graphs highlighting their movements at sunrise and sunset showing that while most bats are nocturnal, few species are diurnal. The echolocation systems of orientation used by bats is explained in great detail and is likely to engross the readers and the use of diagrams to depict the sound pressure levels exhibited by certain animals or objects. The use of such diagrams, graphs or pictures is always useful to attract and sustain the interest of the reader throughout the book.
The diet of bats is of great use to any reader. Especially those who wish to identify the species that haunt their gardens and wreak havoc on their fruit trees. It depicts the ways that bats obtain nutrients and proteins through the accidental feeding on insects and the deliberate chewing of leaves.
Conservation and Importance of Bats
The third main section of the guide is dedicated to breaking down the various human perspectives of bats in Asian and European arenas. Dismissing the false concept that bats feed on human blood it straightens out the categorization of vampire bats as creatures to be feared and despised.
Emphasizing the economic importance of bats to agriculture via essential eco-services such as pollination with over 450 economically significant species of plants relying on bats for pollination, the guide also considers the negative impact of bats as they consume huge quantities of fruits and spread rabies. The guide provides measures to undertake when handling bats and steps to follow in the event of being bitten by a bat while assuring that the odds of dying as a result of a bat borne disease are unlikely.
The guide stresses the importance of actively participating in the protection of these creatures keeping in mind the slow population recovery rate of bats owing to the fact that a female only gives birth to a single infant or twins per year. It presents the ways the reader can help contribute to the conservation of bats and raising public awareness on the need for conservation.
Bats of Sri Lanka
The rest of the book is dedicated to the identification and classification of bats in Sri Lanka. Easy to reference and extremely detailed it provides information on the national conservation status, physical structures, colour, distribution, geographical locations, breeding, roosting and dietary habits of bats. They are distinctively sorted into fruit bats, horseshoe bats, leaf-nosed bats, false vampire bats, evening bats, sheath tailed bats and free tailed bats.
This section is followed by a key and glossary to facilitate the complete understanding and ease of reference to the reader.
Overall Review
The book is extremely comprehensive and easy to use. With an abundance of photographs and illustrations it is designed to capture and sustain the attention of the reader. It caters to the intense and not so intense enthusiasts and acts as a suitable guide for tourists interested in the distribution of bats and the local perspectives on bats in Sri Lanka.
The section on the importance of conservation and the ways in which to facilitate the protection of bat species is most useful especially to its target audience as the guide aims at kindling a sense of responsibility and interest amongst the younger generations.
Although it is slightly overwhelming with scientific terminology in some sections, overall it succeeds in captivating the readers and would definitely be a useful reference to those interested in bats and their conservation.

Criticism on President unfair - Minister
Investment Promotion State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardene emphasised that President Maithripala Sirisena had done much to rid the country of corruption and that undue-criticism levelled against him is uncalled for.
Many of these politicians who are out criticizing him, also know that matters like the Bond Commission and the committee to investigate Mihin and SriLankan Airlines werent initiated by any political party but out of his will and desire to create a future free from corruption, he said. That said, if there are members of the SLFP who also feel this way, I ask them to stand up and voice their concerns now.
The Minister mentioned the issue over the gazette notification rescinding an amendment which allowed women to purchase and work at liquor stores, stating that the President had every right to revoke an amendment which goes against the countrys culture and societal norms. He doesnt deserve to be criticised for that. He was acting in his capacity as President to revoke an amendment which he felt was wrong, Abeywardene said.
When asked if the President could legally and rightfully rescind an amendment, he stated that while the President voiced his opinion, the Finance Ministry has now repealed the law.The State Minister reiterated that the criticisms against the President were on petty issues when the good that has been brought on by this government has been largely forgotten.
The media enjoys the freedom to report as they wish, commissions have been appointed to bring corrupt individuals to book, other sweeping measures are being taken. All of this has been forgotten,the Minister said.
Referring to the upcoming Local Government Elections, Abeywarnene said the SLFP is contesting for 343 LG bodies and has teamed up many political parties based on the electorates. We are certain of an SLFP victory, he said. Referring to the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) which is contesting under the Pohottuwa (Flower Bud) symbol, he said that this upcoming election was also the end of the political road for them. Theres only so far that they can carry this political campaign forward. This is easily their last straw, he added.

Cultural norms preserved: Minister
Cultural preservation reigned supreme in the decision to re-impose the ban on the sale of liquor to women, said Co-Cabinet spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday as he stressed that he was one of the Ministers who asked that the ban be re-imposed.
Until this Gazette was revoked, no one knew of this law. I opposed this in the Cabinet for two reasons; it was a bad idea to bring it during an election and the second reason is that we are trying to create a country free of alcohol and drugs - so we cannot encourage women to drink, said the Minister addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing.
The Minister noted that the Finance Minister had revoked the ban not having consulted the Cabinet and his argument that the law was discriminatory could not be accepted.
We cannot have the same laws as the West. Gender equality is good for women in Colombo and England, not here, remarked Minister Senaratne further.
An equally forceful Co-Cabinet spokesperson, Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara quipped that women in rural areas did not want the ban revoked and that 90 percent of women in this country lived in the villages.Article 12 of the 1978 Constitution, however, prohibits the state from discriminating against any citizen based on race, religion, language, caste, sex, political opinion, place of birth or any one of such grounds. Hence, the ban on the sale of liquor to women is a violation of the principles set out in the Constitution.
Minister Jayasekera, however, insisted that the culture of the country should be protected above all and Minister Senaratne added, Why do women need to buy alcohol when they dont drink

Dont listen to close friends, SAITM parents union tells President
All Presidents should be careful about their very close friends and not distant enemies. It is the same for the current President when it comes to solving the SAITM issue, SAITM Medical Student Parents Union Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Organization of Professionals Associations auditorium in Colombo on Tuesday, he said that the union appeals to the President not to listen to his close friends because their sole objective is achieving private targets.
According to Wijeratne, the parents of SAITM students will never leave anyone alive if the students destroy their lives because of the SAITM issue which has dragged on for years.
All parties had agreed to accommodate all qualified SAITM students at Kotelawala Defence University (KDU), but Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva stated that there isnt adequate space at KDU even without discussing the matter with KDU authorities, he added.

Meanwhile, the public residing in the coastal areas of the Ampara District have requested the Health Department officials to eradicate the mosquitoes which are fast spreading especially after the rains. Immediately after the rains, the low laying areas in the coastal belt are inundated with water which is conducive to the propagation of Dengue mosquitoes.
Garbage have been dumped in the wayside drainage and the flow of water in the drainage channels is blocked. The water in the drainage is not flowing which results in stagnation.
The public in these areas request the Health Department to eradicate the spread of Dengue mosquitoes without further delay.

Ex-LTTEers death anniversary used in election propaganda
A group of TNA candidates in Pudukudiruppu had made use of a commemorative ceremony to mark the 25th death anniversary of former LTTE deputy leader Kittu to promote their election campaign, recently.
This was despite warnings given to all parties to desist from using LTTE images and other memorabilia for the local government election campaign in the North.
At the commemorative ceremony attended by a large gathering, some people who are not related to Kittu paid homage to him by garlanding some of his portraits.
Even children present on the occasion were encouraged to garland some of Kittu's portraits.
Some of the TNA candidates who addressed the gathering had said the TNA was dedicated to achieve the liberation of Tamils and win over their demands as expected by Kittu and other past LTTE leaders. As such, people in the North should ensure the victory of the TNA in all local councils in the North.
However, security sources in the Mullaitivu said the use of children to garland portraits of LTTE leaders had grave overtones much more than using LTTE images and memorabilia for election propaganda.

eZ Cash launches first phase of ATM machines in North
One of Sri Lankas Mobile Money and Payment Service, eZ Cash, launched its first phase of its mobile operated ATM machine to selected retailers from the Northern Province.
The initiative in collaboration with Australias Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) was launched last November in Jaffna and will roll out in phases to expand across 200 ATM locations in Sri Lankas Northern Province.
The eZ Cash ATM machines were handed over to empower merchants and stimulate new business opportunities for entrepreneurs and small retailers with a special focus on women retailers. The eZ Cash based platform will also extend more facilities and cross offers that will empower merchants and provide facilities for utility bills and insurance to be paid at corner stores. Merchants will also receive the necessary training and parallel digital literacy programs introduced to expedite adoption.
The ATM machine has been developed in collaboration with the University of Moratuwa Mobile Communications Research Laboratory and will perform the function of cash withdrawals and cash acceptance. Customers across Dialog, Etisalat and Hutch networks will be able to withdraw money via eZ Cash across a wide network of corner stores and ATMs by simply using their mobile phones.

Minister Mustapha said that there were some parties with a religious label which said one thing to the public while having a hidden agenda and were trying to mislead the public. These racist parties were selling religion and were involved in a massive fraud against the innocent population and will finally join the government after obtaining money.
Such politics was of no use and religion was a purely personal matter and has nothing to do with politics.
Under the leadership of Anwer as done in the past, we can develop this district further. so I therefore request you to support Anwer in this election, the Minister said.

Bond issue report finds:
Former CB Governor acted in collusion with PTL
The long awaited report of the Central Bank Bond issue has found the former Central Bank Governor, Arjun Mahendran to have provided Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PTL)with inside information and acted in collusion with them for the benefit of the latter.
The report also found that the former Governor through his actions, lost the government Rs. 688,762,100 at the auction held on February 27 2015. The Commission recommended that legal action be instituted to recover this loss from Mahendran and PTL.
Though the report studied the issuance of bonds after 2015, the Commissioners also noted that there was adequate evidence to form the view that there may be some irregularities in the acceptance of Direct Placements by the Public Debt Department during the period 2008-2014.
They asked that investigations be carried out to identify the officers responsible, both in the Public Debt Department and in the senior management of the Bank and into primary dealers and those responsible apprehended.
Further the report also highlighted that management of the Central Bank prior to 2015 should be studied and the reasons for the losses incurred by the Bank in the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 and the transactions entered into by the EPF on the Colombo Stock Exchange during the period 2010 onwards looked into.
President Maithripala Sirisena having submitted the report prepared by the Commission of Inquiry to Investigate, Inquire and report on the issuance of Treasury Bonds from February 2015-March 2016 to the Speaker yesterday morning, had the report uploaded on the website of the Presidential Secretariat, thus making it public.
On February 27 Mahendran directed that Bids of the value of Rs 10.058 billion be accepted for the improper, wrongful and malefide collateral purpose of enabling Perpetual Treasuries Ltd to obtain high value of Treasury Bonds at that Auction, at low Bid prices and high yield rates and that Mahendran provided Inside Information (Price Sensitive Information) to Perpetual treasuries Ltd which they used to its benefit at the Treasury Bonds Auction held on 27 February and Mahendran acted in collusion with Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, stated the recommendations of the report.
The Commission has also recommended that the Commission to Investigate Acts of Bribery or Corruption and other agencies look into whether Mahendrans action constitute corruption.
We recommend that the Attorney General and other appropriate authorities consider whether Perpetual Treasuries has used and gained and benefitted from inside information at the Treasury Bond Auction held on February 27, the reported stated further.
They recommend that PTL be prosecuted under the provisions of Section 56A (1) of the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance and in the event of a conviction being entered by a learned Magistrate after Summary Trial in such a prosecution, charge PTL with a fine twice the value of the aforesaid sum of Rs 688,762,100/ or such other amount determined by Court.
In addition to the February 27 2015 auction, PTL has also been found guilty of obtaining inside information during the March 29 2016 auction. The amount earned during this auction however would need a forensic audit, state the Commission and they asked that it be conducted and thereafter PTL be charged a fine twice of that amount.
The Commission has also recommend that the Attorney General investigate into whether Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena are parties to and directly responsible for the commission of an offence.
Given the complete breakdown of trust within the Central Bank system, the Commission recommends that the Monetary Law Act set out criteria when appointing the Central Bank Governor and members of the Monetary Board rather than depending on the discretion of the Finance Minister and President for these appointments.
The Governor of the CBSL is a key official who holds enormous responsibilities and that he must be a person of integrity and ability and also have the required knowledge and experience to effectively perform his duties in the best interests of the Nation and its people, note the Commission.
They have also asked that a code of conduct be issued to monetary board members and the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance and Local Treasury Bills Ordinance be examined with a view to repeal and enact more suitable legislation keeping with the times.

How old are you, INSIDE
Its true. Three months a year I live in the green hills of Nuwara Eliya. Its also true that I am often asked if the best of my work is written in the lush surroundings of the Pidurutalagala mountains. Alas, No. I write amidst the heat and dust of Colombo often late into the night with only the stars to keep me company. But apparently, Im doing it wrong. For, Toni Morrison who won the Nobel Prize in 1993 does it the other way around. She writes at 4am.
Morrison who turns 87 this February has many literary laurels in her name including a Pulitzer in 1988 for Beloved, the Nobel in 1993, and, in 2012, the presidential medal of freedom, from her friend Barack Obama. Being Americas most venerated living writer does not, however, stop a person wanting to look good in pictures. As an interviewer from the Guardian describes her in an article written in 2015, Of all the mantles that have been foisted on Toni Morrisons shoulders, the heaviest has to be the conscience of America. Its both absurd-sounding and true. For almost half a century her subject has been racial prejudice in the United States, a story that she has told and retold with a steadiness of rage and compassion. Her latest novel, God Help the Child, is her 11th and when I arrive at her apartment in Tribeca, Lower Manhattan, Americas Conscience is having her eyebrows drawn on. For the photographer, she explains with a chuckle. Later, she tells the photographer: We did makeup for you. I have eyebrows and everything, then add: You lose all that stuff   The implied second half of that sentence is when you reach my age.
And, it is natural that beauty and the concept of self-image are on her mind as at the centre of her new book is a striking, dark-skinned woman called Bride who tries to shield herself from her own past with surface beautification. A love story unfolds, precariously, between her and Booker, a scholarly young black man adrift in grief for a dead brother. He tells her: scientifically theres no such thing as race, Bride, so racism without race is a choice. Taught, of course, by those who need it, but still a choice. Folks who practice it would be nothing without it.
It was a similar belief that began her publishing career 45 years ago. She has always talked about her first novel with disarming simplicity: it was the book she wanted to read and that did not exist. So, as a single working mother of two small sons, she rose at 4am every day and wrote it. Published in 1970, The Bluest Eye is the story of Pecola Breedlove, a young black girl who prays for blue eyes. Morrison wrote in a 2007 foreword that she wanted to focus on how something as grotesque as the demonisation of an entire race could take root inside the most delicate member of society: a child; the most vulnerable member: a female.
Describing her writing schedule which begins early in the morning she says writing before dawn began as a necessity. I had small children when I first began to write and I needed to use the time before they said, Mamaand that was always around five in the morning I always get up and make a cup of coffee while it is still darkit must be darkand then I drink the coffee and watch the light come. And I realized that for me this ritual comprises my preparation to enter a space that I can only call nonsecular . . . Writers all devise ways to approach that place where they expect to make the contact, where they become the conduit, or where they engage in this mysterious process. For me, light is the signal in the transition. Its not being in the light, its being there before it arrives. It enables me, in some sense.
She adds, I tell my students one of the most important things they need to know is when they are their best, creatively. They need to ask themselves, What does the ideal room look like Is there music Is there silence Is there chaos outside or is there serenity outside What do I need in order to release my imagination
Most writers claim to abhor labels but Morrison has always welcomed the term black writer. Im writing for black people, she says, in the same way that Tolstoy was not writing for me, a 14-year-old coloured girl from Lorain, Ohio. I dont have to apologise or consider myself limited because I dont [write about white people]  which is not absolutely true, there are lots of white people in my books. The point is not having the white critic sit on your shoulder and approve it  she refers to the writer James Baldwin talking about a little white man deep inside of all of us and denies she has one. Well I never really had it. I just never did.
She thinks this is because she grew up in Lorain, where the neighbourhood was racially mixed: Poles, Italians and Jews as well as African Americans. But others think its less to do with demographics and more to do with her own supreme self assurance. It was this that propelled her to Howard University and then on to Cornell, where she completed a masters in literature. It was this self assurance, too, that gave her the courage to split from her husband when she was pregnant with her second child and, that made her such an iconoclastic force as an editor at Random House where she propelled works by black writers into the mainstream. Finally, of course, she herself became one of the publishing houses most cherished names.
Some time ago, when Morrison was interviewed by her friend Hilton Als, the writer and critic, she told him that now shes in her 80s, there are three things she gets to say. One is No. The other is Shut up. And the third is Get out. In other words, she has earned her right not to do what she doesnt want to do. That includes writing a memoir, even though she signed a two book contract with Random House that included one. But then I cancelled it, she says. My publisher asked me to do it, but theres a point at which your life is not interesting, at least to me. Id rather write fiction.
Some people just close when they get old, she explains further. But if youre open, if you have been, you can rely on the lived wisdom of the elderly. Its not the book learning, its the lived wisdom. I ask friends of mine, How old are you, inside, and they always know. I know that I am 23. Theres a moment when you just arrive. Or rather, to quote Alison Flood, in Toni Morrisonss case, there are many moments  at 84 going on 23, she continues to arrive.

Kandy-CH expect a lung-buster
As the pendulum swings mightily this weekend there are bound to be a few tired bodies and concerned management calculating furiously
As mentioned before, injuries and rehab, probably as important as breathing for recovery ...and a half decent plan to survive the last legs of the league and some bubbling ambition about the Dialog knockouts ...looming large in the psyche and quite the topic of animated discussion..in the city by the sea.
Round two....is all about the business end of this Dialog league in sunny Sri ,and essentially a stark statement..about the survival of the fittest island wide.
All club warriors nursing niggles, impact injuries and known ailments, still hungry and a ton of opportunities to showcase their skills, a good deal indeed..!
It is attitude more than anything else that will assure them a good shot of stepping up to the next level.
Kandy have hit cruise control and run out with pride each week 'game ender'.
Looking sharp in the boiler house with Udangamuwa, having a crack response season in the middle.
Heartening to see the likes of these breakaways and Kandys blessing at no.8 ..an absolute curse to all other boiler house units in the league.
His workrate in both attack and defence, quite the charm you want leading your pack.
Irrespective of all the Sri Lanka rep players in the start up and warming that Kandy bench ...this Saturday's CH bruiser ...is going to be just that. A total lung buster from kickoff to full time.
Skipper Gayan Weerey..certainly packs a ton of experience and skill vs the enthusiasm, courage and drive that captain Rohita Chi Chi Rajapaksa packs ....what Gayan has in experience, Rohita makes up in work rate and pushing this Maitland Crescent club beyond their skins.
CH have nothing to lose ..bar their pride and individual status ..so Saturday will give fans plenty to talk about and impact tackles that will echo louder than the Kandy market support.
I am a worshiper and absorb disciple of self belief ...and if CH can sort their injuries and run their full digits for 65mins ...it's going to be a bloody and bruising battle up at the Nittawela cauldron of pain.
What an adrenaline crackerjack it promises to be.
Keys on the day for the lions ..Weeray jnr at 9, Udangamu 8, Wiliweera 11, skipper Gayan 12, Ranjan 13 will cast the biggest shadows on the Maitland marauders...
For CH, expect courage, guts and heaps of skill from Sasanka, Saranga, Satya, and the unstoppable Yoshita..whose work rate impacts the whole team.
Samuel will be calm to boot anything he is presented with and Keegle will run his petrol around all defenders, despite reputation and national colours!
CH need to get decent ball and pressure the lions in their own half ...expect craft and big hearts for coach Lagga to appreciate and coach Taylor back in Sri for Kandy, might get a little nervous, when he realizes that CH will not give up anytime soon.
As the game ticks by the refs shrill to manage the30 warriors will be critical ..but most significantly, it will be the deafening silence as CH run the ball and threaten that Kandy line ...that will be so satisfying to absorb...CH tries will be absolute quiet from the Nittawela faithful. ..face paint and all!
Havelocks and Navy the other two sides with incentives on offer ...finish as close to Kandy as possible and ....few chances left in the final round.
Saturday games are all 4pm starts ...CH in Kandy, Air Force in Ratmalana, Police at Police Park, and Navy run out in Welisara...

Kandy SC keep stranglehold on league title
Kandy Sports Club recorded their tenth win in style on Saturday thumping CR & FC 50-15 at the NIttawela grounds to get closer to retaining the Dialog league title for yet another year. Kandy has won all their games convincingly to maintain their stranglehold in the league.
They had a good plan and great preparation, and they played the best rugby.
Kandy went on a romp on hill countrys fine weather from the kick off to beat CR.
The first quarter CR & FC went hard, and matched their opponents play, but from there onwards the match wasnt that great for the CR & FC that saw too many handling errors, and some shocking kicking resulting in their loss. Kandys win set them up for next weekends clash with CH & FC.
Kandy started the game at full throttle, attacking from deep and putting pressure on the CR. Every CR mistake they capitalized on, not with anything fancy but simple fundamental skills to put the ball over the line.
Kandy completely dominated the proceedings as they collected their points from 5 goals and 3 tries and CR responded with 1 goal, 1 try and 1 penalty. Having taken a commanding 21-3 lead Kandy had more or less sealed the win by halftime.
Kandy have some quality players and some big ball carriers pretty handy and skillful backs and in the forwards some solid tacklers. They did plenty with the ball. The best fly-half in the country today Fazil Marija continued his excellent play, proving the catalyst for his sides impressive win.
He controlled distribution and the midfield in equal measure, and then the centers skipper Gayan Weeraratne, Danushka Ranjan, wingers Richard Dharmapala, Danush Dayan and fullback Nigel Ratwatte played with a lot of passion and a lot of heart.

Unilevers iconic brand Lux, which has been a household name for generations and has a 75year old presence in Sri Lanka, with a range of beauty soap and the latest eight hour long lasting fragrance of Magical Spell body wash, has now introduced a premium, perfumed soap, The Lux Perfumed Bar Collection to local users.

For decades, Lux has won the hearts of every Sri Lankan woman and has become a favourite household brand that has understood and celebrated the intricate nuances of the modern woman. Lux celebrates the everyday womans extraordinary power through perfume. Shes more today than she was yesterday - and wed like to remind her of that tomorrow, and for every moment thereafter, said Category Head Skin Cleansing and Baby of Unilever, Dinusha Ekanayake.
Welcome to an immersive fragrance experience that brings perfume alive said Sharmila Bandara, the Marketing Director-Personal Care at Unilever. It is essential for the modern woman, to express her femininity unapologetically and consistently, and we encourage her to explore it every day.
That is why Lux, is perhaps the worlds most recognizable and iconic beauty brand.
Since its humble beginnings in the early 1900s, Lux has been the favourite amongst iconic women.

Today, Lux champions every woman to be iconic  to be a star that is unapologetic in her femininity and her charm.
The new Perfumed Bar Collection is premium to others in the marketplace, and above even the core Lux range.

Malaysia, a major market attraction post-Brexit
IT has been more than a year since the British voted to leave the European Union (EU), dubbed Brexit. Despite the predictions of an impending recession after June 23, 2016, the United Kingdoms economy appears to have weathered the storm and is poised to perform better this year.
After the first phase of the UK-EU negotiations completed, the British economy seems to have a brighter prospect, with the second stage of talks currently underway. The UK economy is expected to grow at a reasonable rate of 1.5 to two per cent.
This will still be one of the lowest economic growth rate among the Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, but, it is still way better than the prediction of a base case scenario of the economy, which pointed to negative territory for two successive quarters in a row.
Inflation rate is expected to recede this year, relative to last years November figure which was recorded at 3.1 per cent. This will boost the income of UK households as last years rapid devaluation of the sterling is expected to be moderate this year after some progress in the Brexit talks. After a decade of stagnant wage growth, many economists anticipate a rise in UK wages this year.
The fall in net immigration into the UK further supports such wage growth.
As for the monetary policy, while it is clear that the Bank of England has reversed its post-referendum rate cut, the policy movement for this year is still ambiguous on whether monetary tightening will take place and by how much, as a hike might prematurely dampen the positive economic momentum. But, the uncertainty posed by Brexit remains a key challenge to the British economy as many business investments are still waiting for clarification of direction, especially on what it will be like in a post-Brexit scenario.
There are three possible scenarios. The first is the Norway option, which entails almost full participation in the single market by allowing free movement of goods, capital, services, and people.
This seems unlikely as it defeats the purpose of Brexit. The second, the Canada model, appears to be what the UK government wants. In fact, UK Brexit negotiator, David Davis, has advocated for a Canada plus plus plus, suggesting a similar and better deal than the EU-Canada trade deal, known as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA).
And, the third possible outcome is the WTO option, also known as hard Brexit, where Britain will revert to a third country status as far as the EU is concerned.
This would mean that the imposition of tariffs against UK goods and a rise in barriers to UK service exports will take into effect.
But, regardless of what the UK-EU trade ties will look like in the future, it is crucial for the UK government to diversify its export markets moving forward.
And, in this regard, an analysis conducted by the Financial Times (FT), which was recently published, has shown that fast-growing nations, primarily Malaysia, will gain more importance for UK export markets after Brexit.

MATHS CRACKING MANTRA!
Numbers strike fear for many. Mathematics reminds us of a giant monster with uncountable symbols and formulas floating around our head all the time. However when it comes to the Mathematical Olympiad, the monster tends to grow bigger.
For Neathan Fernando doing maths is a passion rather than a penance. The year nine student of the British School in Colombo cracked some profound maths problems and managed to rank as number one among the Upper Primary awardees in the South East Asia Maths Olympiad (SEAMO). Neathan won a Gold medal at the event which was held in November 2017. Students from around 10 countries: USA, Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Mongolia, India and Sri Lanka took part in the event.
I got the opportunity to take part in the event through my school. This was the first time that a school from Sri Lanka took part in SEAMO. Around 50 of us from the British School in Colombo and Elizabeth Moir School were chosen to take part in SEAMO 2017. We were picked after assessing our grades from our report cards. The students with the best grades made it to the competition, Neathan said. 
Incepted in 2016, SEAMO is aimed at promoting interest in mathematics and logical reasoning among primary and secondary school students by assessing their practical knowledge. The SEAMO syllabus is developed based on the Singapore Mathematical Olympiad curriculum. It is a comprehensive syllabus which exposes students to in-depth, stimulating and interesting mathematical problems. They are requested to solve 25 mathematical problems in 90 minutes. It gives them the opportunity to identify their mathematical talents through creative challenges.
The competition was held at the British School in Colombos examination hall. Neathan says that around 15 Sri Lankan students sat for the exam in the Upper Primary category.
The exam consisted twisted mathematical questions in multiple choice format. Students are given space to assess their talent and improve their mathematical skills, Neathan explained.
He says that though their exact score was not revealed they were informed about the their output.
The first problems are the easiest, and the problems get progressively more difficult until the end. The SEAMO examination comprises of six papers for Lower Primary, Middle Primary, Upper Primary, Junior, Intermediate and Senior sections.
The last part of the exam paper was the toughest bit. Some of the word problems were tricky to solve, noted the enthusiastic, innovative and committed young learner.
He says that what he enjoys most about maths is the kick you get when you solve a problem.
This is especially true when it is something you have been thinking of as impossible for a long time, and it suddenly becomes obvious. That a-ha moment  its fun, he enthused.
Handing over the first copy of his book to the Principal of the British School in Colombo Dr. John Scarth
Since the question paper is the same one which is distributed in all the countries which took part in the competition, the level of difficulty of the exam is the same. Thus the Olympiad sets a clear benchmark for Sri Lankan students about their performance as compared to international students.
Mr. Bala, Ms. Chandini, and Mr. Jose helped me prepare for the Olympiad. I am also grateful to Richard Hester for setting the foundation for the subject. I started to love maths because of the way he taught me in the primary school. The British School in Colombo guided and motivated me on my success, he said.
Neathans father is the well known film producer and scholar Dr. Arosha Fernando. His mother, Dr Madhu Fernando, is a leading project management scholar. He has two younger sisters Neve and Nikol who are also studying at the British School.
Neathans ambition is to become a software engineer. He says that he chose that profession because IT will have a bigger role to play in the world in the future.
Apart from being a maths prodigy, Neathan is also into world history. Greek and Roman history has a special place in his heart and he was inspired by the Olympians and the Greek war heroes in writing his first novel Apollo and the Return of Ouranos. The book was published in September 2016. He is currently penning his second book, a detective novel. It will be launched soon.
My debut novel deals with a story which brings Greek mythology to the modern world. Though Greek and Roman history is not exactly a part of our school syllabus I have a special interest towards the subject. Greek and Roman myths intrigue me and I am a fan of movies like the Percy Jackson series, Neathan said adding that he has always scored an A plus for history.
He is also an ardent reader and loves spending whatever free time he has with a book he loves.
With his family
Neathan says that SEAMO is a unique platform which provides resources for students of various levels to hone their problem-solving skills and to prepare for more challenging mathematical competitions in the future such as the International Math Olympiad. He encourages more students to try their hand at taking part in the SEAMO competition.
Do not be afraid to take on challenges. Do not hesitate to take part in events of such caliber and prove your worth, he concluded with a smile.

Minister Kiriella slams media outlets indulging in fake news
Certain media institutions were fabricating fake news and misleading the people, said Minister of Higher Education and Highways Lakshman Kiriella, at the ceremony to vest the Polgahawela flyover with the people, yesterday.
Addressing the gathering, the Minister said US President Trump could win the election despite false propaganda by 99 percent of the American media. But Donald Trump explained the false propaganda by the media using the term fake news and he won the election.
He further said that certain media outlets ought to function within limits and should not unduly cross that line. The people will teach some media outlets a lesson on February 10 at the local government elections.
Minister Kiriella further said that he had commenced three flyovers in Rajagiriya, Ganemulla and Polgahawela in 2016 as Minister of Highways. These flyovers were given to these areas after careful study. Although some ministers prefer to give development projects such as flyovers to their own electorates, as a minister he allocated such projects to the areas which badly needed these projects. Polgahawela needed a flyover long ago and the present government fulfilled that requirement.
We may get assistance to construct another ten flyovers from the government of Spain this year, Minister Kiriella said. Government hopes to construct a flyover at Yangalmodera where there was a serious accident recently. Every district will have a 75 km carpet road.
Referring to the local government elections, the Minister said that President and Prime Minister had decided to allocate more funds for development projects in local government authorities. The present government will continue definitely till 2020 and government needed fullest support from the people.
Ministers and MPs of the area were also present.

New  butterfly  discovered
The Shiva Sunbeam (Curetis siva), a species hitherto unrecorded in Sri Lanka but found in India, has been recently discovered by our butterfly expert Dr. Michael van der Poorten.
Although earlier misidentified as a seasonal form of another butterfly, the Indian Sunbeam (Curetis thetis), Dr. van der Poorten has now confirmed the existence of the species, Shiva Sunbeam (Curetis siva), in Sri Lanka as well.
The adult butterfly can be seen flitting through the canopy of trees in the wet zone forests and is generally encountered around Nadun trees which are one of its larval food plants. The males occasionally settle on moist soil, much to the delight a photographer.
This brings the total number of butterfly species thus far recorded in Sri Lanka to 248, of which 31 are endemic. In 2016, Dr van der Poorten and his wife Nancy published their landmark , Butterfly Fauna of Sri Lanka, ,wherein they documented the habitats, distribution and adult behaviour of all 247 species in the island at the time.
Dr. van der Poorten, with over 40 years of experience as a Lepidopteristin Sri Lanka and Canada, also discovered a new butterfly in Sri Lanka in 2008, Catopsilia scylla, which is native to Australia, Singapore and Malaysia. In addition, he is credited for discovering the butterfly Cephrenes trichopepla, also a native of Australia, in the same year. Both butterflies are now quite widespread across the country.

Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said on January 16, the newly opened Sandharani research centre in the premises of Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration will undertake the research as its first assignment to probe into the
reasons behind various allegations made against public servants including inefficiency and delay in the work.
The Minister addressing the gathering said that public servants have to face both allegations and praises when they perform their duties.
The main allegation against them is the delay in the work. "We have to find reasons and solutions for this issue urgently and that is why we have established this research center to look into the matter", he said.
The Minister said that many public servants do a very good job, but there are others who do not perform their duties up to the level expected by the public. "These officers always try to show the
financial regulations and establishment codes as the reasons for the delay. When there is a delay in work, it can be led to frauds and corruption. Therefore, we must take immediate steps to resolve the problem, he added.
"Public servants should do their utmost contribution for the development of the country. They must learn to work with new technology in order to achieve this target. We will expand technology programmers for the betterment of Grama Niladhari officers. Many public institutions have good conduct, but there are some institutions where bribery and corruption are rampant. Our main aim is to introduce anti-corruption strategy to all government institutions, he said.
The Sandharani research center consists of Sanshravani lecture theater and e-library.

North Korea crisis: South to continue talks with 'clear eyes'

South Korea says it will continue high-level talks with North Korea with "clear eyes" amid global warnings that Pyongyang might be playing for time to continue its nuclear-arms programme.
"We have to make the most" of the opportunity, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told the BBC.
The two Koreas earlier agreed to march under a "unified Korea" flag at next month's Winter Olympics in the South.
The talks come as the US and its allies vowed to keep pressure on the North.
On Wednesday US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said sanctions were "really starting to hurt", expressing confidence that the pressure would eventually force the North to the negotiating table over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Last year,US President Donald Trump said that America would destroy North Korea if forced to defend itself or its allies.
Also on Wednesday, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said the world should not be blinded by Pyongyang's recent "charm offensive".
What is Seoul's negotiating stance
Kang told the BBC: "I think we understand North Korea better than anybody, having dealt with North Korea for decades, having had series of discussions off and on.
"We haven't had any significant engagement in the recent past - but this is an opportunity.
"You can have all kinds of theories of why there are here (at the talks). There are, obviously, calculations going on the part of the North Korea decision-makers as to their actions.
"But in the end we have to make the most of it.
Kang also said South Korea and its allies were "very much on the same page" regarding the longer term - the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
And the foreign minister said Seoul wanted more humanitarian aid to be sent to North Korea as sanctions were beginning to take effect.
What has been agreed about the Olympics
If the plans are realised, a hundreds-strong North Korean delegation - including 230 cheerleaders, 140 orchestral musicians and 30 taekwondo athletes - could attend the Winter Olympics.
It will mean the opening of the cross-border road for the first time in almost two years.
The two countries have also agreed to field a joint team for the sport of women's ice hockey. It would be the first time athletes from both Koreas have competed together.
The Games will take place in February in Pyeongchang.
The North has also agreed to send a smaller, 150-member delegation to the Paralympics in March.
The agreement will have to be approved by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting on Saturday, because North Korea has missed registration deadlines or failed to qualify.
South Korea will also need to find ways to host the North Korean delegation without violating UN Security Council sanctions outlawing cash transfers to Pyongyang and blacklisting certain senior North officials.
What has the reaction been in South Korea
South Korea's hockey coach and conservative newspapers have expressed concern about the prospect of a united hockey team, saying it could damage South Korea's chances of winning a medal.
Tens of thousands of people are said to have signed online petitions urging President Moon Jae-in to scrap the plan.
But the liberal leader told South Korean Olympic athletes on Wednesday that the North's participation in the Games would help improve inter-Korean relations.
How did the deal come about
The talks came after tensions on the Korean peninsula reached their highest point in decades.
This is because North Korea has made rapid advances in its nuclear and conventional weapons programmes in recent years.
Its latest ballistic missile test, in November, sparked a series of fresh sanctions from the UN targeting petrol shipments and travel.
Soon afterwards North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he was "open to dialogue". In a New Year speech, he said he was considering sending a team to the Winter Olympics.
The breakthrough announcement that the North would be sending a delegation came on January 9.
It was also agreed that a military hotline between the nations, suspended for nearly two years, would be reinstated.

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, addressing a special press conference at the Parliamentary Complex after the receipt of the reports from the Presidential Secretariat, said all the reports will be tabled when Parliament meets on January 23.
The Presidential Secretariat handed over 26 copies of the Bond report and a copy of the PRECIFAC final report containing 34 volumes to Parliament Secretary General Dhammika Dassanayake yesterday morning.
The report of Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Bond Issue contains 1,400 pages and only the English copy is available. Both reports were handed over by the Presidential Secretariats legal officer Muditha Dissanayake to Parliament yesterday. The report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) runs to over 10,000 pages and only the Sinhala copy is available.
Speaker Jayasuriya said tabling the reports in all three languages is the usual practice of Parliament as per the Standing Orders. Therefore we informed the Presidential Secretariat on the need of translations of these copies as soon as possible. The Presidential Secretariat has entrusted the task of translations to the Official Languages Department, he said.
The Speaker also told the media that the Presidential Secretariat has informed that the Bond Commission report has been uploaded to its official website.
Soon after the press briefing the Speaker met the Government Printer to get 300 copies of the bond report as soon as possible to distribute among the 225 MPs and the media. The Speaker said he has requested more copies of the PRECIFAC report from the Presidential Secretariat as the only copy now in possession of Parliament could not be sent to other institutions as it has a responsibility to make sure that the content would not be altered.
The Speaker said a Party Leaders Meeting has been scheduled at 9.30 am on January 22 to decide on a date to debate the reports.
Responding to a question as to how MP Ravi Karunanayake has received a copy of the bond report before the other MPs, the Speaker said the report was not sent to Karunanayake through Parliament. Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumanthipala replied that the Presidential Secretariat has sent a copy to MP Karunanayake as his name has been mentioned in the report.
Asked as to what disciplinary action Parliament intends to take on the MPs who had been named in the Bond report, Sumathipala said Parliament does not have to assume the role of the courts of law. He added that the legal process would determine what actions to be taken.

Past winners recall the most memorable moment in their lives
The Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year awards show, over the past four decades of its cherished history, has produced many Sri Lanka star players who have made their mark in the international arena.
Undoubtedly, all of them name the day they had got on to the mega stage as the most memorable day in their cricketing careers.
Winning an award at the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year mega show is a lifetime experience for any schoolboy.
Honouur received at such glamorous platform would not only an appreciation and encouragement for their achievements during the season but would also elevate them to a higher level as future Sri Lanka material.
That is preciously why that all those who had been privileged to experience that great honour commend the mega show and Sunday Observers role to foster school cricket for four decades.
Many legendary Sri Lanka cricketers feel that the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title they had won had been the most memorable award in their lives and its inspiration to go places in the big league. Ever since its inception way back in 1978/79, the contest has produced many top Sri Lanka cricketers who had made their mark in international cricket.
That includes several legendary Sri Lanka cricketers including the worlds highest Test wicket taker Muttiah Muralitharan, World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga and ICCs Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle.
In their recent interviews on the Obsever-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year, many past winners of the countrys premier school cricket awards show, which has now turned out to be the Mother of all Shows, have commended the role played by the contest.
The first ever recipient of the mega title - former Royal, NCC and Sri Lanka captain RANJAN MADUGALLE says that the Lake House and the Sunday Observer should be complemented for keeping the show going for all these years.
Sponsors are essential to keep the show going. In the past, most of the winners of the top awards came from Colombo and its suburbs, but now, the outstation schools have come in a big way and it is a positive sign for the game. May the show continue for many years to come, says the ICC Chief Match Referee.Sri Lankas world cup winning captain turned Cabinet Minister ARJUNA RANATUNGA, who had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year twice in 1980 and 1982, said it is the dream of any schoolboy cricketer to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award.
Its great to conduct the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Contest since 1979 to encourage the budding schoolboy cricketers. I was particularly happy to see that the Northern Province joining with the others in the competitions at the contest, he said.
I am happy at the improvement of outstation cricket as the game has spread far and wide in the country. Many Sri Lankan cricketing giants of the past and the present are those who have either won the prestigious and coveted Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Award or won other awards at the contest, Ranatunga added.
Former Nalanda captain, Sri Lanka cricketer and present manager of the national team ASANKA GURUSINHA, the winner of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 1985, had this to say: When Roshan Mahanama, from my school team, won this award twice in 1983 and 1984, I felt how prestigious it is to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award.
It is not an award that everybody could win. One has to perform exceptionally well and be consistent right throughout a season to win that  work really hard to reach the pinnacle of school career.
The Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year show has not only produced top cricketers but some international level umpires such as Kumar Dharmasena who serves in the ICC elite panel Gurusinha said.
A star ingredient of Sri Lankas successful recipe to 1996 Worls Cup victory SANATH JAYASURIYA, who had won Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year  Outstation title in 1988 said that it is hard to express that great feeling.
Not only me but also my parents, brother, relatives, coaches and school masters, they all enjoyed that cherished moment.
It was a great feeling. All past winners before me, be it the All-island or Outstation, had made their mark in Sri Lanka cricket.
So, when I won the title, I felt that I am getting closer to earning a place in the national squad, Jayasuriya said.
Former Nalanda captain KUMAR DHARMASENA, the winner of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award in 1989, said that it was one of the greatest moments in his career as a cricketer. Winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title was a big inspiration. That helped and encouraged me to play for Sri Lanka.
Winning such a mega award gives a huge image and confidence to a schoolboy cricketer to go places. We were determined to reach the top of the ladder and did so with dedication, said the ICC elite panel umpire who had now competed 50 Tests as umpire.
Former Sri Lanka captain MARVAN ATAPATTU, who won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in the very next year after Dharmasena, said that he considers the mega title he won in 1990 as a certification or a guarantee that he would play for Sri Lanka. When I had been performing well and scoring constantly for Ananda as a schoolboy cricketer, many considered me as a future Sri Lanka prospect.
Although I too had felt that I had a chance, there was no guarantee. All those who had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title before me had gone on to play for Sri Lanka with distinction.
So, when I won the title, I knew that I too could join that select band, he said.
Sri Lanka cricketer NIROSHAN DICKWELLA, who had won the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 2012, feels proud to step into the international arena though the Mega Show.
It gives me great pleasure to learn that the contest has lasted for four decades.
This has produced a galaxy of star cricketers in the All Island and Outstation competitions. Most of the recipients are doing well in their chosen professions may be cricket or otherwise.
My best wishes for a successful run of the contest in future. Winning the award was a great encouragement for me, Dickwella said.
The national mobile service provider, Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel continues to provide that smart connection to the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Contest, which continues to enjoy the longstanding association of the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) and the Sri Lanka Cricket Umpires and Scorers Association under the blessings of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC).
Meanwhile, the mportant first term matches of the inter-school first X1 cricket season are in top form before the traditional big matches starts in two months time. At the same time, the race for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contests too have attracted thousands of schoolboys who support their favourite cricketers.

PM initiates Johanns Everest summit climb campaign
Let us back Johann Peries to be the second Sri Lankan to scale the summit of the Mount Everest which he attempts to make in April 2018, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Premier Wickremesinghe said that Peries made a wise decision to return during his first attempt due to the technical fault and he is here today to make the second attempt while Jayanthi Kuru-Uthumpala made it to the top in April 2016. He added that Johann is firm with his decision to summit the Mt Everest and let us all back him to take up the challenge.
I have been the first sponsor for one of the steps and I put the pin at the very top, the Premier said. You can fill it from the bottom up to that and then he will have all the support and the sponsorship he needs to get there.
 I call on every one in Sri Lanka to help him with this second attempt to reach the summit of Mt Everest.
He made these observations yesterday at the Blue Hall of the Hilton Colombo at the launch of the Climb with Johann campaign launched to support Johann Peries for his second attempt to summit Mt Everest. The premier also launched the website www.johanneverest2018.com
Johann dedicates this expedition to all Sri Lankans and everyone will get an opportunity to be part of the climb by sponsoring each step of the challenging climb. Every Sri Lankan Can sponsor each step that john takes on the mountain for Rs 100 and be a part of this exhilarating climb. The total cost of the Everest Expedition amounts to USD 58600. However during his first attempt Johann manages to reach a height of 8,400m a mere 448 short of reaching the summit before technical difficulties forced him to descend.
Johann Peries said that people kept on asking him as to why he was going back. There are lots of sentiments that have come my way and its something very personal, Johann said. I think people who are fascinated about doing things always want to achieve their goal and finish what they started. And that is what is for me as well.
He added that he had a fabulous partner with him last time and that would be the lack this time by his side. I have the strength to do this, Johann said. I ask everybody to join me in this climb with me. I will take you to the top of the world.
Johann Peries and Jayantha Kuru-Uthumpala also spoke. Prof. Maithri Wickramasinghe and former MP Rosy Senanayake were present.

President was hurt by certain remarks - Rajitha
Co-cabinet spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday clarified that the President had merely voiced his displeasure against certain remarks made against him by some members of the UNP.
He rejected claims that there was animosity within Cabinet, as reported in the media.
The President was hurt because the attacks came from within, Minister Senaratne said. The Prime Minister promised to speak to these MPs and ministers and sort out the matter, he added addressing the weekly cabinet media briefing at the Government Information Department.
The co-cabinet spokesperson further observed that the government has been put in a difficult spot because most of the criticism was coming from within, and that their challenge was not from the Mahinda Rajapaksa faction but from within the government itself.
The national government has brought two staunch enemies together.It is not easy to keep them together and many within the government have forgotten that it is a national government and dont know how to act within it, Senaratne said.
Co-cabinet spokesperson, Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara also observed that the Bond Commission was not appointed to attack the UNP, but due to public demand.
Minister Senaratne also denied reports that the President had stormed out of the cabinet meeting.
Co-cabinet spokesperson, Gayantha Karunathilake who also echoed the views of the former two, said a meeting called by the UNP working committee last night had nothing to do with the events that took place in Cabinet on Tuesday morning.
The Prime Minister appointed a JVP member as COPE chairman to investigate into the Bond issue, he wouldnt have done that if he wanted to bury it. At the same time, the President rightly appointed a Commission to investigate it. So the government is not trying to bury the issue,Senaratne said.
Those who dont agree with the government should leave, he added.

Qatar Sheikh detained in UAE flies to Kuwait
QATAR: A controversial member of Qatar's royal family who accused the United Arab Emirates of detaining him has flown to Kuwait, his family said on Tuesday.
Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali Al-Thani, who emerged as a key figure in the dispute between Gulf states in the weeks after Riyadh and Abu Dhabi cut ties with Doha last June, left the UAE with his daughters.
My father is on his plane to Kuwait with his two daughters, said his son Ali bin Abdullah Al-Thani.
After arriving in Kuwait and checking his health, he will decide to return to Qatar or travel abroad for treatment.
Sheikh Ali added that his father's health was not stable and he was suffering from heart disease and diabetes.
Sheikh Abdullah, seen by some as a potential challenger to the Qatari leadership, had posted a video online on Sunday saying he was detained in the UAE and afraid something could happen to me that will be blamed on Qatar.
The UAE denied Sheikh Abdullah was being held against his will, with state news agency WAM reporting he was in the country at his own behest.
It also said he was free to leave.
In August, Sheikh Abdullah met powerful Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to mediate on reopening a land border to allow Qatari pilgrims to perform the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.
It was the first public high-level encounter between the two nations since the diplomatic crisis erupted.
The spat over Sheikh Abdullah was the latest row in the ongoing political crisis between rival Gulf states.
Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain severed ties with Qatar on June 5 over allegations it supported Islamist extremists and had close ties to regional rival Iran.
Doha denies the accusations.
Kuwait is one of the Gulf states to remain outside the conflict and has acted as a mediator during the eight-month long dispute.

Revoking of alcohol Gazette: 11 women file FR in SC
Eleven female citizens including popular actress Samanalee Fonseka yesterday filed a Fundamental Rights petition in Supreme Court seeking a declare that Ministry of Finance or the State are not entitled in Law to revoke the Excise Notification dated January 10, 2018 in a manner which directly or indirectly prevents a female from lawfully being employed at a place of production and sale of liquor.
Petitioner Nishanthi Bandaranayake, M.D.J.B. Fernando, Samanalee Shanika Fonseka, M.D. Chandima Ravini Jinadasa, Deepanjalie Abeywardana, Attorney-at-law Sabrina Esufally, Sharanya Sekaram, Randhula de Silva, Meneka Galgamuwa, Sujatha Gamage and Visakha Tillekeratne had cited Minister of Finance & Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera, Ministry Secretary Dr. R. H. S Samaratunga and Attorney General as respondents.
The Petitioners state that by Excise Notification No.02/2018 dated 10th January 2018, the Minister of Finance has inter alia revised the Excise Notification No. 666 by inter alia repealing paragraphs 5(v) and 11(c) of the said Excise Notification No. 666.
The petitioners said Paragraph 11(c) indicates - Persons to whom Liquor is not to be sold or given - No liquor shall be sold or given.. (c) to a woman within the premises of a tavern
The Petitioners state that this prohibition was a draconian measure that was arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable and discriminatory to female citizens of the Republic.
The Petitioners state they were reliably informed that at a media briefing, a member of the Cabinet of Ministers, Mahinda Samarasinghe has declared that at a meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers ostensibly held on January 16, 2016 the Cabinet of Ministers has purportedly decided to revoke the recent Gazette allowing women to purchase alcohol which the Petitioners verily believe refers to the said Excise Notification. The Petitioners state that the above circumstances gives rise to a reasonable apprehension regarding an imminent infringement of the Petitioners right to equality and equal protection of the law guaranteed to them by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution in as much as-
(a) Any revocation of the said Excise Notification would be unreasonable.
(b) Any such measure would deprive the members of the female gender who have attained the requisite age specified by Law from being lawfully employed at places of production and sale of liquor.
(c)Any such measure would deprive the members of the female gender who has attained the requisite age specified by Law from lawfully purchasing liquor which is a legal product that can only be manufactured, distributed and sold with the express regulation and control of the State.
(d) An imposition of a prohibition applicable to members of only one gender would tantamount to an unequal treatment of the members of such gender.
The Petitioners state that the above circumstances gives rise to a reasonable apprehension regarding an imminent infringement of the Petitioners right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of their sex guaranteed to them by Article 12(2) of the Constitution.
This petition had been filed through counsel Thisya Weragoda and Thamali Dinushi Perera.

The college was initiated as a collegiate school 167 years ago, when it was founded by Rt. Rev. James Chapman D. D. on February 3, 1851 in Mutwal. The school was later relocated to Mt. Lavinia on January 26, 1918, after it grew into a prominent boys school in a short period of 67 years.
Rev. Billimoria further said there would be a special thanksgiving service at the Chapel of the Transfiguration on the anniversary date, along with a special general assembly at the College hall. Six special speeches would also be delivered by distinguished old boys of the school, he added. The release of two books; Bishop Chapmans Memoirs and Poems and Prose on S. Thomas College, would also be held alongside the assembly, he said. The Thomian Parade, which is to be held on January 27, would be the largest school parade ever in Colombo, with the participation of a crowd exceeding 8,000 from across the country, Rev. Billimoria said. He expressed his gratitude to the old boys of the school and the Wardens Special Event Team, for their commitment in organizing a grand celebration for the college.
Having completed a 100 years at Mt. Lavinia, we look back with a sense of pride and achievement, because during those 100 years, we have achieved quite a lot; not only academic life, sports, and other extracurricular activities, but also in the number of students who have turned out who have gone into the world of men and had an impact on Sri Lanka. Over the years, the college has achieved much and contributed largely to this country, and it is those achievements and contributions that we want to celebrate, so that modern generations of Thomians would realize their heritage, Rev. Billimoria said.
Meanwhile, a representative of the Wardens Special Event Team, Bertal Pinto Jayawardena speaking to media, said the ultimate goal of the anniversary celebration events, is to find funds to develop the school. He added that the net proceeds of all the events would be allocated for the development of the school.
Suren Dayaratne, the representative of the Special Events Team by the Old Thomian Cadets Union, said the Thomian Parade  2018, would go with the themes Safety First and Going Green. A Cycle Parade of 200 cyclists completing a 100-km ride, would commence from Christ Church, Mutuwal, as a part of the parade, he added. The cyclists would join the main parade from Milagiriya to Mt. Lavinia along Galle Road, which would be participated by S. Thomas College students, parents, old boys, retired staff, branch schools from Gurutalawa, Kollupitiya, and Bandarawela, and other invitee schools with well-wishers, he added. He added that they would not include elephants to the parade, as environmentalists have raised concerns to the sensitive issue. School Warden Rev. Billimoria said S. Thomas College always adheres to a strict environmental policies.
Senaka De Fonseka, a member of the Wardens Special Events Team, speaking to media, said the Gala Dinner and Life Time Achievement Awards event would take place at the Galle Face Hotel Grand Ball Room on February 17, as a part of the 100-year anniversary celebration. Fonseka added that the tickets for the Gala were sold out one month prior to the event. S. Thomas College Sub-Warden Asanka S. Perera was also present at the press brief.

With this new consortium, it is planned to achieve set targets of the industry thereby come up with strategic and proactive initiatives to identify pain points, then to act as a best solution provider for Sri Lankan make rubber products.
EDB which is currently in the process of developing the National Exports Strategy targets US$ 13 billion export target this year, Malwatte said adding however, as per the regional data, Sri Lanka total exports are likely to reach US $ 15 billion. Sri Lanka has also set an export target of US $ 20 billion by 2020 and according to Malwatte Sri Lanka is well on its path to meet this target.
Rubber Products Industry is a key sector contributing 6.9% to exports in 2016. The major markets are USA, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Canada, UK, and Brazil. Sri Lanka supplies to major international brands such as Continental, Solideal, Wonder Grip, Mapa, and Safety work, Tesco, etc. Companies in the rubber industry use state of the art technologies for manufacturing the above international brands.

Supreme Court clears ambiguities
Controversy and uncertainty reigned in the corridors of power last week, with all major political parties scrambling to peruse the Constitution and consider different political strategies. The reason for the hullabaloo was a decision by President Maithripala Sirisena to seek a determination from the Supreme Court regarding the duration of his term of office.
Early last week, the President wrote to the Supreme Court, as was his prerogative. The question posed by President Sirisena to the highest court in the land was: whether, in terms of Provisions of the Constitution, I, as the person elected and succeeding to the office of President and having assumed such office in terms of Article 32(1) of the Constitution on 9th January 2015, have any impediment to continue in the office of President for a period of six years from 9th January 2015, the date on which the result of my election to the office of President was declared.
The confusion about the exact tenure of the President appears to have arisen because of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. This amendment, which was passed by an overwhelming majority in Parliament on April 28, 2015, reduced the term of office from six years to five years. It also imposed a two term limit on an individual holding the office of President.
The key question for which President Sirisena was seeking an answer to was whether these restrictions applied to him too. That is because the 19th Amendment was enacted after his assumption of office and there was an opinion, at least in some quarters, that it could not have retrospective effect.
Subsequent to the Presidents request, the Registrar to the Supreme Court wrote to the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) informing the BASL that the matter would be listed in court on January 11. This allowed interested parties to make submissions to the Court.
Making his submissions on the issue, Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya argued that the tenure should be six years. The 19th Amendment commenced on May 14, 2015. By that time President Sirisena had already commenced his six year term. The 19th Amendment has no provision that says that it is applicable retrospectively, he noted.
The thrust of Attorney General Jayasuriyas submissions was that any change in the Presidents tenure would amount to an interference with the peoples sovereignty, as they had elected him for six years. The President is elected by the people. The term of office will be that provision in force at that time. The retrospective provision on this issue will have to be approved by the people besides ratification by Parliament. The sovereignty of the people enshrined on Article 3 of the Constitution cannot be alienated, he submitted.
19th Amendment
Opposing the Attorney Generals view was Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva. The incumbent President could have invoked the Supreme Court under Article 121, soon after the enactment of the 19th Amendment to clarify his rights. He didnt do so. The President could have challenged his rights as a citizen then. He did not do that. He could have challenged the reduction of his term. He did not do it soon after the 19th Amendment was passed in May 2015, de Silva argued.
Counsel K. Thiranagama, also objecting to the submissions made by the Attorney General, said that the 19th Amendment had reduced the term of office of the President from six years to five years with the approval of parliament and political parties. It flows obviously that the people approved the reduction of the term, he submitted.
In fact, it was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who had flagged this issue first. In a recent statement, Rajapaksa noted that the next President was required to be in office by January 2020. For this, Rajapaksa had pointed out, nominations for the next presidential election had to be called in late 2019. As such, there were only a little over one and a half years between the local government elections in February 2018 and nominations for the next presidential poll, he argued. It is unclear as to whether Rajapaksas forewarning of events precipitated the presidential request. Whatever the reason, it certainly ruffled a few feathers several political parties.
The leadership of the United National Party (UNP) took the Presidents request in its stride and refrained from making public comment. Nevertheless, some UNPers were disappointed that the question had been posed without taking the party into confidence first. They noted that the UNP was the single largest contributor in terms of votes towards President Sirisenas election in January 2015 and as such, the party should have been extended that courtesy. Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella was to concede that the reference to the Supreme Court had caused uneasiness among the allies of the government.
Other UNPers were less diplomatic. State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe claimed that the President was indulging in politics while Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was busy developing the country. Colombo district UNP parliamentarian S.M. Marikkar also lashed out, noting that it was the UNP that was responsible for the Presidents election to that office.
Predictably, the Joint Opposition (JO) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) were extremely critical of the Presidents move. Rajapaksa took upon himself the task of questioning the Presidents decision to refer the matter to the Supreme Court. If it is the Presidents contention that the five year restriction does not apply to him, Rajapaksa told the media in response to questions, then the two term limit for holding office as President should also not apply to former President Chandrika Kumaratunga and himself, Rajapaksa declared.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva stated that the President was attempting to secure power in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). He should have referred the matter to the Supreme Court when the 19th Amendment was introduced, Silva said. President Sirisena did respond to the criticism that was levelled at him. Addressing a meeting at Akuressa, he stated that he had sought the decision from the Supreme Court as opinion was divided on the issue. He said that he would accept the Supreme Court determination whatever it might be on his term of office and was ready to leave the Presidency even immediately.
Eventful political drama
Meanwhile, legal pundits were analysing the issue and the majority was of the view that the five year term will prevail. This was mostly because of the transitional provisions included in the 19th Amendment, where Section (49)(1)(b) states that: For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that the persons holding office respectively, as the President and Prime Minister on the day preceding April 22, 2015 shall continue to hold such office after such date, subject to the provisions of the Constitution as amended by this Act.
The Supreme Court did convey its findings to President Sirisena on Sunday. On Monday, the Presidents Media Division announced that the Supreme Court had determined the term of office of the President to be five years.
Thus the curtain came down on an unexpected and brief but eventful political drama that will however continue to have its implications. Foremost among them is the indication given to other political parties by this process that President Maithripala Sirisena would be inclined to seek another term of office. The UNP, the JO and the JVP will no doubt now go back to the drawing boards to formulate their strategies, knowing that another presidential election is very likely in less than two years.
Even if President Sirisena himself is undecided on what course of action will be most prudent, the decisive factor would be not what transpired last week but the outcome of the forthcoming local government elections- and that is a verdict that will be awaited with greater anticipation than the determination of the Supreme Court.

Three member UNP Committee to study Bond report
The UNP Working Committee had decided to appoint a three member committee to study the Presidential Commission report on the Central Bank Treasury Bond issuance, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim said.
Addressing a press conference at the Sirikotha UNP Headquarters yesterday, he said this three member committee would study the report thoroughly and it is found that any member of the UNP is involved in the issue, they would be punished, irrespective of their position.
Responding to the media, he said he had yet not gone through the report by last evening and said he was not in a position to comment on its content.
However, I must add that from what we have heard of the report, although many were accusing the UNP of being involved in this scandal, no one from the UNP has been implicated in this report.
According to Hashim, when the government is being praised, then all parties want to take credit for it, but when something goes wrong, then it is called a UNP government.
As far as the UNP is concerned, yes we are a UNP government and we will take responsibility if we do something wrong and we are not afraid to apologize and correct ourselves. At the same time we will not stand aside in a crisis and try to blame others.
Hashim noted that it was the UNP headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who initially requested the COPE Committee report on the Central Bank Bond transaction to be handed over to the Attorney General in 2016. However, a presidential commission was appointed to investigate this transaction and even this report has now been sent to the AG for legal action.
This is what we proposed in 2016. We are not afraid and we have always been very open. If this investigation was done during the previous regime, then these committee members would perhaps not be alive by now,Hashim said.
He said many people have come up with varying figures with regard to the bond issue, and the losses caused to the country.
But it is termed a deemed loss, which implies that there may or may not be a loss. As far as we know what is stated in the report is that Perpetual Treasuries may have made may have made unlawful gains.
"As the UNP we have and will give our fullest cooperation in this investigation, he said.

Tips for soft and sexy feet
Dry, cracked feet are not sexy as it can drastically spoil your overall look. Especially if you like to wear strappy sandals, rough looking feet can be embarrassing. Even though most of us deal with this problem on a daily basis, for some it can just be a seasonal hazard.
But regardless whether you face this problem all throughout the year or just once in a while, you just can't ignore it. So, if you love wearing open-toed-shoes but your crusty feet, toes and nails prevent you from doing so, you need to read this.

Go for a shower 



When you go for a shower, give importance to your feet as well. Make a shower ritual of cleaning your feet thoroughly. Scrub them well with the soap or body wash you are using. This is the basic thing, which all of us can do and it will take hardly any time.
Make sure you wash your feet every night before going to bed to get rid of the smell and dirt. Dirty feet are as bad as cracked feet and can make you feet look very unattractive.
Indulge in some milk therapy



Buy an extra 250ml of milk and soak your feet into it, at least once a month. The milk should be warm whole milk.
Doing this will benefit yours feet as the lactic acid will remove all the rough spots and make your skin extremely soft.
If dropping your feet into a bowl of milk is a little difficult then apply some milk on your feet with a cotton ball once a week.
Soak your feet




Feet shower is just not sufficient to get soft feet. Besides, the shower ritual, soak your feet in warm water at least for 5-10 minutes. This method will help you to get soften your crackled and dry feet making it easier to get rid of dead cells. Avoid soaking your feet for too long.
Get rid of the dead cells with pumice stone

Take a pumice stone and gently scrub your heels, toes and soles at least twice a week. This method will help to remove dead cells as the Pumice stone will make your feet softer and silkier. Spend two minutes on each foot focusing on the areas where the skin is rough and dry. Avoid scrubbing too harshly to prevent skin tear and irritation.

Shape your toenails

Take your nail clippers and get rid of extra toenails. Shape your toenails when you are just done with your feet shower therapy. If you have any rough edges, file them. Long toe nails can be a host to dirt and bacteria which can cause infections.

Let your shoes breathe


Air out your shoes for at least a day before you wear them again especially sneakers and boots.
If your sneakers stink, toss them out or get them cleaned. Wearing smelly shoes can also amage to your feet. Hence, before you wear your shoes next time, do a smell check to keep your feet healthy.

Moisturize your feet


Slather your feet with some moisturizer and put on clean cotton socks. It's best to do this before you sleep cause then the moisturizing effect will be greater. You can also use vegetable oil instead of cream.

Wear proper shoes

Wear proper fitting shoes. A good fitted pair of shoes can drastically reduce the chances of getting cracked heels. Comfortable footwear can feature heels but they should be wearable. The footwear has to sit comfortably on the foot without causing pain during walking.

Rest is essential


Cracked feet can be caused by long hours of standing or walking. It is important to give your feet rest to prevent cracked heels and soreness.
Give a nice foot massage 


Foot massage will improve the blood circulation of your feet and will also relieve strain. The exfoliation and oil used during the treatment will ensure that your skin will feel softer and refreshed.

Towards a well-planned economy
The lender of last resort, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, is under heavy fire now, due to the release of extracts of the report on the Bond Commission appointed by the Head of State. The report submitted by the commission is expected to come before the Parliament.
Therefore, it is our duty, as students of economics and political science, to evaluate scientifically the origin of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, its gradual evolution, varied functions and performance, lapses and also to arrive at a judgment whether it has fulfilled the expectations of its founding fathers and the high degree of faith kept in/on it by the people of Sri Lanka.
A Central Bank is an independent national authority that conducts monetary policy, regulates banks and provides financial services, including economic research, covering every aspect and wide corners of an economy. For performing all these assignments, it has earned the prestigious name, The Bankers Bank. A Central Bank is expected to stabilize the nations currency, keep unemployment low and prevent inflation.
Central Banks stimulates economic growth by controlling the liquidity of the financial system. To control this liquidity they are fully armed with three sharp weapons. First and foremost, a Central Bank can set a reserve system/a reserve requirement. It has the legal authority to tell the network of commercial banks, how much cash they can possess each night. This ceiling can put a limit to a banks lending.
The second strategy of Central Banks is to use the open market operations to buy and sell securities from member banks. It changes the amount of cash in hand, without changing the reserve requirement. It is said that the European Banks manipulated this tool during the 2008 financial crisis. Further, it is pointed by financial experts that private and commercial banks bought government bonds and mortgage-back securities to stabilize the banking system. The third strategy used by the Central Banks is to set up definite targets on interest rates they charge from their member banks. By using this method, they guide rates for loans, mortgages and bonds. It is well understood, that raising interest rates slows growth, preventing inflation. This theory is well known as contractionary monetary mechanism.
Sweden, established the first Central Bank THE RISKS-in 1668. The Bank of England, came next in 1694. Napoleon created the Banquet de France in 1800. Congress, opened the Federal Reserve in 1913. In Canada, the Bank of Canada entered the banking field in 1935 and the German Bundesbank, joined the queue later.
Active, robust monetary policy
After gaining political Independence from the British Raj in 1948, The Central Bank of Ceylon was set up in Sri Lanka by the post independence government, taking into consideration the importance of an active, robust monetary policy and a dynamic monetary sector to support, enhance and promote economic growth in all spheres of economic life.
The Currency Board System that came into being, under the Paper Currency Ordinance No: 32 of 1884, looked after the functions of banking prior to the inauguration of the Central Bank in Sri Lanka. On setting up of a Central Bank in Sri Lanka, the then Government of Ceylon requested the services of the United States Government for technical, structural and financial advice. As a result of this request, the US Government appointed John Exter, a reputed economist of the Federal Reserve Board of the U.S.A. to shoulder these responsibilities and assignments for the government of Sri Lanka.
After studying the financial sector in Sri Lanka and her responsibilities towards achieving sustainable development, John Exter submitted a very comprehensive report to the government in November 1949. Based on the recommendations of this report, The Central Bank of Ceylon was established by the Monetary Law Act of (MLA) of No: 58 of 1949 and commenced operations on August 28, 1950.
It was renamed the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in 1985.
The main objectives of the Central Bank were enumerated as follows by the MLA of 1949.
01. Maintenance of Price Stability(Stabilization of domestic monetary values)
02. The preservation of the par value or the stability of the exchange rate of the Sri Lankan Rupee(sustainable maintenance of exchange rate- stability)
03. The promotion and maintenance of a high level of production, employment and real income in Sri Lanka.
When analyzing the different tasks of the Central Bank and its relevance to the Sri Lankan economy, it is our duty as students of economics to turn to the pages of the doctoral theses submitted by Prof. H A de S Gunasekara to the London School of Economics on the subject of From Dependent Currency to Central Banking in Ceylon-An analysis of Monetary Experience 1825-1957. In his well-researched thesis, Professor Gunasekara has underlined the fact, that the Central Banks performance during the first years of its existence has not been fully successful to prevent the volatility of money supply originating from fiscal deficits and export fluctuations.
Even the present day economists who have done in-depth studies of Central Banking performance from 1949 to date vindicates Professor Gunasekaras findings and is of the opinion, that the analysis outlined by Professor Gunasekara that the limitations of the Central Bank in a developing economy, saddled with the twin objectives of economic development and stabilization, still remain valid.
Economic or social targets
In a planned economy or when there is a definite economic plan for a country, the tasks of a Central Bank is much smoother than in an unplanned economy. In a well planned economy, the economic or social targets are well set for a definite period, for five-seven years. A Central Bank operating within this set course, knows the ambitions and objectives of the government in power and the welfare options it intends to undertake within this period. But in a market orientated economy this assurance is absent.
Therefore, in a market orientated economy, where the demand and supply theory dominates the relationship between the government and the Central Bank varies from a country to country.
There is a general consensus, that the Central Bank in a country should be allowed to handle its affairs completely free, without any kind of impediments blocking its freedom. The rationale behind this argument is that when there is direct or indirect political interference, the Central Bank will fail to conduct sound monetary policies aiming at price stability. There is another point of view, which elaborates that the Central Bank should be under the control of the government.
However, in practice Central Banks in market orientated economies operate between these two extremes and it is observed that they enjoy different layers of independence in different countries.
In parliamentary democracies, where the voice of the people is given priority consideration to satisfy the political constituency, the general tendency is to incur government expenditure for various populist welfare measures such as handouts, subsidies, and income transfers to households. Without pragmatic plans in store, job creation will also be undertaken in certain sectors and the final result will be surplus of employees, hindering the economic performance of the particular institution.
Economists who have researched this aspect of financing, point out, that this is one of the main reason for the prevailing and on-going budgets deficits. To finance these ongoing deficits, borrowing is the only alternative. In situations like this, the government in power expects the Central Bank to come into its rescue and the Central Bank will have to print money to uphold the unfinanced portion of the deficit. Further, there will be budgets and interim budgets.
In a situation like this, only an independent Central Bank can advice the government in power to refrain from power-hungry solutions. The function of price stability should be the prerogative of the Central Bank.
The yahapalanaya government which took over the political administration of the country in 2015, decided to transfer the subject of Central Banking and monetary policy from the Finance Ministry to the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry, headed by the Prime Minister.
During the last regime, an outsider who did not posses any Central Banking experience was appointed as its Governor, although there were several Deputy Governors rich in experience and sterling qualities. Arbitrarily, their due promotions were neglected and suppressed. A former Governor is also alleged to have been involved in bidding for the commonwealth games and lobbying for his political masters lavishly spending ratepayers money. The bond scandals that have come up reveal that there had been established precedents from 2008 and the present regime also followed the same course by appointing a foreigner to the top position of the CBSL and allowed him to use its position lavishly for the benefit of the kith and kin, ignoring the long-term national interests.

UNP to launch election campaign today
The United National Party (UNP) election campaign for the upcoming LG election, would commence from Kandy, under the patronage of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, today. Currently, the organizing mechanism from grassroots level is underway, but the main election rallies would commence from today.
Addressing a press briefing at the Sirikotha UNP Headquarters, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim said it has been the UNP that wanted to hold the elections without delay. Over the past one and a half years, we have been asking for the elections to be held without delay. However, certain factions did not want it, as they wanted to wait until they were politically-prepared to face the election. The UNP is not afraid to face an election and is always committed to give the people their rights. Even when we were in a disadvantageous position, we still wanted the elections to be held on time, as it is the peoples right, he said.
Some political parties were looking for the best time to hold the election to suit their own agendas, he said. It is regrettable that they are concerned about their own desires, and not that of the people.
Hashim added that certain candidates who are now making all sorts of pledges to the people, were those who had over 15 years to fulfill the needs of the people, but had failed. They had been in power for 15 years as Provincial Council Chairmen and MPs, but they neglected all the needs of the people. Now, they shamelessly return and ask to be elected back into power. When they first came before the people, they arrived on push cycles and promised to work for the public, but instead of keeping their promise, they only worked for themselves and now, are driving around in Prados and Monteros. Yet, having made their lives comfortable without caring for the people, these same individuals are back, asking for peoples votes and pledging more promises, he said.

UNP members barred from criticising President
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday informed the membership that they should not criticise President Maithripala Sirisena in public for any reason.
Presiding over a UNP Working Committee meeting, the Prime Minister informed the party membership to contact him if they had any problems.
He said politicians belonging to the party including all Ministers and Parliamentarians should refrain from criticising the President whatever crisis existed politically.
At this meeting, it was emphasised that the Bond Commission report had been used to sling mud against the UNP. Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva pointed out that Perpetual Treasuries Ltd had earned unconscionable profits by purchasing bonds and selling them to the EPF.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said a programme should be devised to educate the public about the Bond issue.
Minister Harin Fernando who explained UNP plans to win the local elections in the Uva Province said the UNP could not allow others to dance the merry devil after winning power through a long and protracted political struggle.
Some members pointed out that the SLFP seniors such as Susil Premajayantha and Dilan Perera had been directly targeting the Prime Minister in their criticisms.Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said correct information should be given to the people if there had been any fraud involving the Bond issue.
All Parliamentarians were also advised to get directly involved in the UNP election campaign both in their electorates and other areas in the country.
The behaviour of certain media institutions in targeting the Prime Minister also came up for discussion and it was decided to take appropriate action against such unfounded criticism.

Veteran athlete Yoga felicitated for 50 years of service
Veteran athletic coach Yogananda Wijesundera was felicitated for his 50 years of untiring service for Sri Lankan athletics during a ceremony participated by his contemporary coaches, athletes and sports association officials at the Olympic House yesterday. The event was organized as a part of Save the Sport organizations annual felicitation program for veterans who have contributed immensely for the betterment of Lankan sports. Sri Lankas 1996 cricket World Cup winning team captain and Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga was the chief guest at the occasion.
It was a great inspiration to athletes as 73-year-old Yoga who is feeble delivered a moral boosting speech after receiving the Save the Sports felicitation plaque from Arjuna Ranatunga. Yoga revealed that his knowledge in other fields has immensely helped him to become a great coach for over five decades.
A coach must be a knowledgeable person. Not just on sports, he must be aware on fields such as politics, geography and history. Discipline and personality are paramount. It takes a long time to earn fame, but ill-fame will come in a flash. Sports have become an art, but it can differ according to the coaches viewpoint, Yoga explained.
Yoga also went on to say that two kinds of people are engaged in sports at present, those who work for the betterment of it and those who are depending on it. The latter he mentioned were people who have ulterior motives to earn money tarnishing the true spirit of sports.
He thanked Ranatunga for taking the initiative to felicitate sporting greats at a time the Sports Ministry was failing to do this national task.
Ranatunga recalled how the advices and opinions Yoga revealed during TV programs helped him to mould his cricket career as well as his personal life.
Our country is badly in need of coaches of Yogas calibre at present. Unfortunately we dont see such coaches coming up. Sports veterans and former champions are getting distanced from sports day by day with no proper mechanisms. Sri Lankas cricket success was mainly based on former Minister Gamini Dissanayakes short, medium and long term plans. But today not only cricket but also other sports are facing a retreat. Temporary solutions will not solve the problems, we all have to join hands to take Lankan sports on the right track, Ranatunga said.

Voter under siege
I remember elections to the national legislature from the time a by-election was held for the Avissawella Seat in the late forties. This election was to elect a member to the State Council to fill the vacancy resulting from the unseating of Phillip Gunawardena. I have forgotten the reason. Scion of the family of the famous Boralugoda Ralahamy, Phillip a born fighter, courageous and university educated was a constant irritant to the colonial rulers.
The Police being the most visible instrument of colonial rule, his bte noir had been the ASP of Avissawella. Sydney de Soyza who in his own right was a leader of the Salagama community. The constant clashes between Philip the intrepid politician and Sydney the arrogant policeman are legendary. They were both honourable men of sterling character, qualities that stand out as the profound difference between such men of today and yesteryear.
At this by-election, an important booth of Battaramulla was in the CMS Boys School located within the St. Mathews Church premises at the Ganahena Junction. The above mentioned being about 150 metres from my ancestral home I was able to observe the behaviour of the candidates, their supporters and the ordinary voters. There were three candidates as far as I remember. Bernard Jayasuriya, Josephian Cricketer and father of Gamini Jayasuriya; Harry Gunawardena, a sibling of Phillip Gunawardena; and Forrester Obeysekera, a leading member of the aristocratic Obeysekera clan of the Siyane Korale. They were all cultured men of honour from the Western Province.
Election symbols
These candidates did not have election symbols but had been allotted different colours. Voters were guided by ballot boxes of the colours of the respective candidates. I remember Bernard Jayasuriya visiting the polling booth dressed in a green shirt and green cap, Harry Gunawardena dressed in a red shirt and red muffler and Forrester Obeysekera dressed in a full white suit with a brown tie. All these gentlemen who were honourable in every respect had untainted reputations. The men who escorted them were also decent looking, not the drunken rowdies that throng round politicians today. Importantly, every voter of whatever conviction had an educated, honourable candidate with a high reputation to unhesitatingly vote for with pleasure.
There were no indications of the emergence of a scenario where party leaders would be able to nominate buffaloes, rogues and idiots, make asses of all of us, giving us no chance whatsoever of voting for a decent man or woman to enter Parliament. It did not take long for buffaloes and idiots to take Centre Stage!
The entire nation tuned to the electronic media on January 10 in a state of shock and awe were compelled to see Sri Lanka being disgraced before the entire world by her so-called leaders. Without question, the day of this dirty brawl will go down as one of the dirtiest days of Lankas recent history. The epitaph on the tombstones of each of these buffoons is bound to read, Here lies the remains of a rowdy and thug who with several others on January 10, 2018 annihilated the dignity of Parliament and plunged the nation to disgrace and shame.
Rowdies and thugs
With the offspring of these rowdies and thugs smacking their lips and waiting to succeed, to see an epitaph of this nature would indeed require a long and inordinate wait. By that time the rampant treasure hunters enjoying political patronage would have decimated the graveyards of the country!
Why has politics gone to the dogs today Given that modern Democracies function with the party system as the piston that drives the engine the deterioration of the quality of leadership of political parties in Sri Lanka has had a damning impact on the politics of the country. The trend that began in the late seventies has today reached an alarming state. With no love for the country, interested only in gaining power or remaining in power so-called leaders have become prisoners in their respective parties. No party leader has thrown out the rogues and riff-raff from his or her party; and there are no party leaders who refrain from accepting rejects!
Our political parties are in a woeful state. The few men of integrity are overshadowed by the corrupt many. When the integrity of leaders themselves become suspect what hopes can the people entertain Leaders who have lost their moral right to lead their parties must be considered as having sacrificed their right to aspire for national leadership.
To party leaders craving for power and power alone it is only numbers that matter. Corrupt idiots making up the numbers are preferred to good people. Leaders also care for people with money. These are the people who can win elections. Often the moneyed people are serving parliamentarians or former parliamentarians or their offspring. To these corrupt politicos, this is the best investment. Enter parliament or a local body, make money, spend on the next election and make double the amount spent. This unending process goes on, shutting out the deserving from politics.
The people have endured these dirty ways of our politics for several decades now. Our leaders have taken us for fools for long enough. If they can present to us over and over again only the same individuals with proven track records for corruption, something different has to happen. The known devil is better than the unknown devil theory is beginning to be questioned. Perhaps the country is expectantly waiting for an acceptable unknown devil!
Having seen and even worked under political greats and gentlemen of the calibre of SWRD Bandaranaike, Dudley Senanayake, N.M. Perera, Phillip Gunawardena, Pieter Keuneman, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Lalith Athulathmudali, Gamini Dissanayake, Felix Dias Bandaranaike, Laksman Jyakody, I cannot think of a present-day leader who can even get close to anyone of these stalwarts of the past mentioned.
Future elections
The burning question at future elections is daily becoming more and more obvious. For how long more will corrupt dictatorial types and tin-pot buffoons be able to shape our lives. Sri Lanka has a proud history. The people will not like to be ruled by pathetic leaders who publicly shout Hora Hora at each other! This discredited brigade, will sooner than later be thrown out lock, stock and barrel. That will herald the beginning of a better Sri Lanka! I for one together with a large slice of the population of this country have been political fools for long enough. The time is nigh for this label to go.
If party leaders who nominate candidates cannot think beyond known rogues, they are not leaders but accomplices aiding and abetting criminals. The country expects party leaders to act with responsibility recognizing and respecting the intelligence of the people.
As the editorial of The Island of the 13th January quite rightly observes, Voters are in a dilemma. They know all these political parties for what they really are, dens of thieves.
The editorial further states, Those who brawled so shamelessly like a bunch of ruffians, turning Parliament into a fish market of sorts, the other day are elected representatives.
Here, I tend to disagree. The people have had no choice but to elect these ruffians nominated by the party leaders for reasons that I have elaborated earlier in this article. If three political parties nominate a buffalo, a donkey and goat respectively and if the goat is elected is it fair to apportion the blame to the voters
As you say, looking at the nomination list for the forthcoming L.G. elections there are hosts of unsavoury elements who deserve to be behind bars; and the onus is on the people to handpick the decent candidates in the fray. But Sir, if we strike off the rogues, rapists, chain snatchers, kasippu dealers and brothel owners, will there be anybody left The dilemma of the voter is indeed becoming more and more complex.

Waiting for Godot
Some Joint Opposition stalwarts, it appears, are on cloud nine after the Supreme Court determination that President Maithripala Sirisenas tenure would be confined to five years. For the likes of MPs Keheliya Rambukwella and Wimal Weerawansa, both against whom there are serious corruption cases pending before the courts, the verdict has become a countdown of sorts before Dday in early January 2020. Rambukwella addressing the media stated that they had withstood all difficulties and harassment of the government for three years and waiting another 18 months was no big deal.
Weerawansa, on the other hand, has decided to make the countdown from the day the pohottuwa wins the local government elections, at least in the mind of the Colombo district MP. He said, from February 11, after the results are announced, government administration will cripple, with government employees refusing to take orders, the police similarly ignoring instructions and the military personnel turning their backs on the directives issued by their superiors. For WW, therefore, the whole process of sending the Yahaplanaya Government packing and installing Mahinda Rajapaksa back on the throne is going to begin with the pohottuwa victory on February 11. The likes of Weerawansa and Rambukwella, no doubt, are holding fast to the belief that the present conundrum in which the government has found itself in has sounded its the death knell and brought about a finality of Yahapalanaya rule.
The duo being seasoned politicians cannot be unaware that a lot can happen in politics during the course of 18 months, as certainly a lot can happen between now and February 10. Politics is known for its ebb and flow and fluidity. Situations that obtain today can drastically change tomorrow and those sitting pretty one day can plunge into the abyss of despair, as is the nature of politics.
The UNP government of JRJ, in 1987, had to contend with humongous opposition to his rule, with daily street protests and general agitation, the norm, over the signing of the Indo-Lanka Accord. Hundreds were shot dead opposite the Janadhipathy Mandiraya, itself, at the time of the signing and the entire country was engulfed in flames, with lengthy curfews imposed to control the situation. At the time, like now, the constant refrain of the critics of the government was betrayal of the country rata paava deema, to India. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was rifle butted by a naval rating during a guard of honour inspection prior to the latters departure from the country, suggesting that the armed forces as a whole were set to turn its guns of the government, that saw two Indian warships dropping anchor just off Galle Face. To say the popularity of the government was at its worst nadir would have been an understatement, what with even senior ministers like Gamini Jayasuriya resigning and Prime Minister Premadasa and Lalith Athulathmudali boycotting the reception accorded to the visiting Indian Premier.
Yet, hardly one year following the turmoil and turbulence in the country, where anti-Indian feelings ran high, and the government squarely blamed for surrendering the countrys sovereignty, the UNP won the Provincial Council elections including in the south, notwithstanding that the PCs were an Indian creation aimed at devolution of power to the Tamils.
Not only that, the Premadasa era that followed was marked by even worse conflagration, with the second JVP uprising unleashing a bloody campaign by both the insurgents and the government that saw mutilated dead bodies strewn on streets and a rash of student protests ala the SAITM campaign. The tail end of the Premadasa regime also saw the Grand Old Party disintegrating, with the exit of Lalith, Gamni and Co.
However, the UNP prevailed at the PC elections held the same year following Premadasas assassination, winning four of the six Provincial Councils in the south.
Hence, the Joint Oppositions celebrations at the expense of the governments, obviously, temporary setbacks, at present, is premature. The picture could well change by the time the main elections are due, if not in the coming days. True, the Bond saga has had its negative fallout, damaging the governments Yahapalanaya credentials.
But the public are aware that positive action has been taken by the government to deal head on with the complaint. Ministers were hauled before the Commission and the Prime Minister, no less, summoned to clarify issues arising out of the alleged fraud.
In contrast, they are aware that Mahinda Rajapaksa swept all swindles, corruption and sleaze under the carpet, and, what is more, protected the crooks, rogues and the plunderers.
The JO campaign to rouse the public that the end of the Yahapalanaya is nigh is bound to lose steam once the details of reports on the 34 acts of corruption, now with the President, comes to light. The boot then would be on the other foot, with the JO worthies implicated in these swindles, running for cover. There are only 18 months, as Rambukwella and Weerawansa say, they have to wait. It certainly is going to be a very interesting 18 months, without doubt.

Where do Sri Lankans learn about sex
Watching pornography in Sri Lanka is illegal. But like many things in Sri Lanka that are illegal on paper, it turns out its actually quite popular. Pornhub.com, the largest pornography website in the world, released its global viewership statistics at the end of 2017. Sri Lanka ranked high on the list of countries with the greatest increases of watching pornography over the previous year: Sri Lanka came in eighth place, following Belarus and Vietnam.
On average, according to Pornhub, Sri Lankans are watching pornographic videos for 96 seconds longer than they did last year.
In terms of sheer traffic, Sri Lanka moved up 23 slots, tying the country with Pakistan.
Some who advocate for better sexual education believe this trend is worrying. Because Sri Lanka does not have a comprehensive sexual education programme in schools, for many young people, this online exposure to sex is the first and only context they have about physical intimacy.
A young man in Colombo, speaking to the Daily News anonymously, summed it up succinctly: People think porn is the reality.
Pornography without education
Sarah Soysa, a programme and advocacy coordinator at Doctors of the World in Sri Lanka, said that at a recent meeting with other medical professionals, the conversation turned towards whether depictions of violence in pornography were leading adults and young people towards dangerous ideas about sex.
A study from the journal Violence Against Women found that out of more than 300 pornographic videos chosen from some of the most popular websites, more than 88 percent displayed physical aggression. Almost 50 percent showed some form of verbal aggression.
Soysa said she suspects, although cant confirm, that such videos might support violent conceptions about sex.
What a lot of people, medical professionals, health professionals, the INGO community, what they said was: maybe its triggered by watching porn, she said. Because (pornography) shows gang rape as something very enjoyable all the time.
Maybe theres a link or connection there, she added, although we havent studied it.
An unofficial survey by Bakamoono.lk, a website devoted to encouraging sexual education, showed that some people in Sri Lanka are searching specifically for violent content. Out of 800 anonymous responses to the survey, almost 180 respondents said they searched for gang bang.
Top searches for men included the terms Sri Lankan, teen, and homemade, both aware of and not aware of, being filmed.
The website, which is run in part by The Grassrooted Trust, warned that the responses should be taken with a grain of salt.
Because the survey was filled out anonymously, it was not possible to distinguish if the respondents were being honest, the authors wrote.
Because the act of watching pornography is so private, its difficult to gauge its effect on society.
But sometimes anecdotes bubble up to the surface. Soysa said that as part of her work with Doctors of the World, she helps conduct sexual education workshops around the country, where the subject of pornography occasionally comes up.
When we have conversations with women, sometimes they start opening up about issues and sometimes they start talking about the man doing different things.
For them, its like weird things, she said. They say things like: the man asked us to do this, and we dont really know what it is, they watched it in porn.
One of the Bakamoono respondents wrote that I dont really like watching porn and only do occasionally as my husband insists. I feel sorry for the people in them since I cannot imagine they enjoy having to do that particular act for money.
Misconceptions about sex
What is known is that in the absence of sexual education, many people do turn to the Internet to answer their questions.
When we do trainings, the first question we always ask is, 'How do you get information (about sex)', Soysa said. What people mostly say is the Internet, and then friends and magazines.
These answers are the same in both major cities and rural villages and estates, she said. Almost all young people have access to mobile phones, she added.
As a consequence, Soysa often finds herself dispelling basic myths about sex and intimacy.
For girls, its virginity, she said. ( I get) questions like, does everyone bleed I ride bicycles, how does that affect me
Theyre really stressed about it, she said, because there is so much cultural value attached to virginity and so little access to informed education about sex.
For boys, (the stress) is mostly and always about penis size, she added. Doctors of the World is working with the government to develop a sexual education curriculum in the North. Other organizations, like the Family Planning Association, do their own sex education trainings. Bakamoono.lk posts articles about topics like HIV and sexuality to their website.
We all do different efforts in different areas, but nothing is centralized, Soysa said. Thats the problem.
Government tackles sex education
Last year, the Parliamentary Monitoring Committee on Women and Gender started a pilot project in the Western Province to introduce a sexual education curriculum above Grade 6. Dr. Thusitha Wijemanne, Chairperson of the Parliamentary Committee, said that based on the success of that programme, they are trying to expand it to every province.
We recognize the importance of awareness of sexual education to reduce child abuse, early pregnancies, and sexual harassment, she said in an interview.
In the Western Province, a group comprising the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Women and Childrens Affairs, The Family Health Bureau, the National Education Institute, and the National Child Protection Authority developed a three-month curriculum regarding reproductive and sexual education. It addresses topics like menstruation and contraception.
We have already started this programme, this teacher training programme in the Western province, she said. At the moment however, we dont have enough staff for the teachers training programme (islandwide), she said.
In addition, Dr. Wijemanne said that there is a cultural barrier to sexual education. Most of the teachers are reluctant to teach this subject, she said.
Instead, most of these teachers ask children to study on their own. They must be trained not to do that.
She also added that the committee is putting a special focus on the North and North Central Provinces, which she said were more high-risk areas.
The goal is to minimize the sexual harassment, she said. (These students) need sexual education in the adolescent stage. Be cause if they dont have the education in school, they will go look for it somewhere else. That much is clear.

Wife seeks army support in probing ekneligoda case
Sandya Ekneligoda, the wife of disappeared journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda has handed over a letter to Army Commander Lt. Gen Mahesh Senanayake requesting his assistance in the probe into the disappearance of her husband.
In the letter Sandya Ekneligoda noted that its been eight years since her husband had disappeared on January 24, 2010, but had received little or no help in tracing what had happened to Prageeth Ekneligoda. She accused the system of favouring the guilty while continuously penalising the victims.
In her letter she said she respected the security forces as a disciplined force, where the image of the entire force should not be tarnished by the actions of a handful. Therefore, she urged the Army Commander to assist in the continuation of the investigations and help to bring those responsible to book.
Army Commander Lt. General Mahesh Senanayake told Daily News that the army will certainly continue to assist in any investigations without bias.
However, he noted that the investigations had commenced in 2015, and at that time he himself was out of the army. But, he said while those responsible should be brought to book, one should bear in mind that a soldier is not in a position to question an order that has been given.
Therefore it is not the soldier, but the person who gave the order that should be held responsible and punished. That is why the CID should continue the investigations and find out those responsible. The army works on teamwork. Therefore, if an army person, be it a lower ranker or upper ranker, has done something wrong he will be punished. I cannot run an army of thugs, the Commander added.
The case pertaining to the disappearance of Prageeth Ekneligoda was taken up in Court on Tuesday, but as the army had asked for further time for the investigation, it was postponed to February 8.

Yala National Park administration under heavy criticism
The administration of the Yala National Sanctuary has come under heavy criticism due to various reasons.
Yala National Park has gained wide popularity among tourists around the globe. The visitors to the park said that food such as short eats and other consumer items at the restaurant are sold at exorbitant prices for local sightseers, animal lovers and foreigners. The visitors said that two Wades and two bottles of milk are sold at Rs.1,000. A bottle of water which is only Rs. 50 is sold at Rs.150. Although there are no proper toilets, wash room facilities and sanitary facilities, the visitors are compelled to pay Rs 100 to Rs. 200 to use them. The safari jeep drivers said that they have to wait in long queues for their turn for hours.
Efforts of this correspondent to inquire about these allegations over the phone proved futile.
