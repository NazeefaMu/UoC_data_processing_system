## Date: Thursday, April 12, 2018 - 01:12
BRIBES EXCEEDED LEGITIMATE TRAFFIC FINES
The Ceylon Motorcyclists Association alleges that the amount spent by motorists to bribe police officers far exceeds the amount paid for traffic fines.
Speaking to the Daily News, Ceylon Motorcyclists Association President Chirantha Amarasinghe said due to the hassle in paying traffic fines, people find it easier to bribe the police officer and leave.
Sri Lanka is internationally noted as a country where people prefer to bribe rather than take the trouble to go through the process of paying the fine.
He said as a percentage, when the government receives Rs.500 as a fine, over Rs. 800 goes into the hands of police officers by way of bribes. Amarasinghe said the published government revenue from traffic fines in 2015 was Rs. 2.1 billion, while in 2016 it was Rs. 2.2 billion. Based on these figures we projected that the amount that would have been paid as bribes could be around Rs. 3.2 billion. In fact, when we requested for the figures from the police, they refuse to give us the relevant information. Due to the police accepting these bribes, it is difficult to maintain proper road discipline and safety. Those who commit road traffic offenses often get away by bribing the police, he said.
The association also pointed out that a great number of complaints had been received pertaining to impractical laws being implemented during the festive season.
They claim that on average the number of complaints per day is around 10 to 20 but during the New Year and Christmas season the number of complaints shoot up to around 50 to 60.
He said the police dont allow motorcyclists to have cameras fixed on their helmets.If these cameras are fixed then it is a form of evidence if the rider commits or does not commit an offence. But I dont understand the basis on which it is not allowed, but the police simply disallow it. Around 70 percent of the vehicles on the roads are motorcycles and three wheelers, adding up to around 4.8 million vehicles in total, Amarasinghe added.
Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara denied these allegations noting that there was no basis for the estimates arrived at by the Ceylon Motorcyclists Association. Bribing is wrong and as much as it is an offence to accept a bribe, it is also an offence to offer one. Therefore, people who bribe are also at fault. Instead of bribing as a means of escaping an offence, people should complain if a police officer asks for a bribe so that this system could be changed.
SP Gunasekara told the Daily News that instead of levelling charges based on speculation, the Ceylon Motorcyclists Association should gather these complaints and make a complaint at the Bribery Commission. I would accept their allegations if they have complained and nabbed any police officer who was demanding a bribe, he said.
Meanwhile, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) Director General Sarath Jayamanne said the Commission intends to establish special units to monitor and bring to book the bribery cases of the various state institutions in the near future. He said currently there is no provision to separate the numerous cases but added that once the new recruitments are made and the new units established, they will have information on the separate institutions.

Cabinet approves Standard Packaging for tobacco products
Cabinet this week approved the introduction of Standard Packaging for tobacco products, to reduce the appeal of smoking.
The Cabinet paper submitted by Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, requested that the standard package have only two colours; black and white and no other picture or mark aside from the trade and product names, quantity of products and information or a mark determined or made compulsory by the government such as health warnings.
In order to adopt this change, the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act No. 27 of 2006 would have to be amended and Cabinet directed the Legal Draftsman to make draft the necessary amendments.
Tobacco smoking is estimated to kill 25,000 persons every year and the government from time to time, had introduced pictorial health warnings, restriction of smoking in public places, banning of advertisements and promotions, rationalisation of the tobacco tax structure and nationwide information and education programmes to discourage smoking among the general populace.
The minister, in his paper, pointed out that cigarette consumption by adult males had decreased from 29 percent in 2011 to around 24 percent in 2015 as a result of the above measures and that his target was to reduce it to 15 percent in next four years. Australia and the UK, which had adopted plain packaging or standard packing together with pictorial health warnings, have shown that these steps have contributed to a decline in smoking during the last three years.

Cabinet nod for Family Doctor concept
The Health Ministry had received Cabinet approval to strengthen the primary healthcare system in the country by promoting the Family Doctor concept.
Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing, said, "As we face an ageing as well as increasing population, it is necessary to bring the health service closer to the people."
Improving primary care curative facilities closer to home, would also reduce the current burden on tertiary care facilities, the minister added.
At present, a network of 970 primary level curative hospitals that operate under provincial health services, are largely bypassed by patients, resulting in overcrowding of healthcare facilities at a tertiary care level. A large number of people also visit private hospitals and specialists, Dr. Senaratne said.
The government had suggested that general practitioners (GP) be used in the primary care system and have one or two doctors cater to 5,000 patients.
Patients would then need a recommendation from their GP, to consult a specialist, rather than going straight to one. A series of consultations had also allowed the ministry to come up with a detailed programme of implementation to improve primary care facilities.

The failure to offer the Opposition Leader post to the Joint Opposition, which is the largest single party with 57 members in Parliament, is a breach of people's sovereignty, Parliamentarian and Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said.
He said the Speaker should be ashamed to keep the leader of a 16-member party propped up by the government, attempting to use the Opposition as its pawn by pampering it with undue privileges.
MP Gunawardene expressed these sentiments addressing a press conference held at the MEP head office at Elhena Road, Maharagama.
He said he hoped that the outcome of the No-Confidence Motion would at least help the Speaker to face reality and offer the Opposition Leader's post to a party with majority membership in the Opposition.
He said the government had suffered a breakdown with the results of the local government elections. This would not be glossed over by merely effecting a Cabinet reshuffle. Although the government attempted to survive the remainder of its term with money and pledges inimical to the nation's interest, the government would be short-lived.
No one was able to forecast the government's lifetime. Although it tried to contain inflation by printing money, it would only exacerbate the problem. Greece too faced a similar situation, recently, Gunawardena said.
MP Gunawardene said that the country was heading towards an economic depression.

Civil society groups pen letter to Facebook CEO:
Criticised for failure in controlling hate speech
As Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg appears for questioning before a Senate committee in Washington, D.C. this week, a group of Sri Lankan civil society groups has released an open letter criticizing his companys failure to control hate speech online.
Facebook is under heavy scrutiny in the West after a technology firm, working for then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, allegedly obtained the personal data of millions of users.
However, in Asian countries such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, advocacy groups accuse the company of contributing to spread hate speech that promotes and enflames ethnic violence.
We remain deeply frustrated when reporting Facebook posts and pages perpetuating everything from gender-based violence and violence against the LGBTIQ community to hate speech, with little to no support from your platform, the authors wrote.
This is particularly so for content in Sinhala, one of Sri Lankas national languages, and widely used on Facebook by around the six million monthly active users of the country, they added.
The letter was signed by 13 civil society groups, including the Centre for Policy Alternatives, Bakamoono, and the Youth Advocacy Network Sri Lanka.
They demanded swifter action in reviewing and taking down posts flagged for inappropriate content and alleged the companys response is especially poor for posts written in Sinhala or Tamil.
According to the authors, a post from March, which was written in Sinhala and advocated violence against Muslims, stayed up for six days after it was first reported for hateful content.
Later, Facebook said the post did not breach any guidelines, the authors alleged.
But the companys own rules prohibit any written attacks on people based on their Race, Ethnicity, National origin, (or) Religious affiliation, according to their website.
At the very least, the company should make clear the number of moderators assigned to deal with user-generated reports around content in Sinhala, in which the Facebook office or time zone they are located in, as well as their gender, is specified, the letter said.
There should also be a clear commitment to look into and resolve user-generated reports within a specific time period, which during heightened violence, must be further reduced, the statement continued.

Dematagala tank slated for renovation
A programme for the renovating dilapidated tanks and canals will be undertaken by the Anuradhapura District Secretariat office with the support of the irrigation, forest conservation, wildlife and other departments.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that under these programmes special attention has been focused on the ancient Dematagala irrigational project located in the Palagala DS division. The programme will be implemented in two phases. Under the first phase, it is proposed to fully renovate the Dematagala tank which was constructed with a dam across Moragolla Oya. The water capacity of the Dematagala tank is 1000 a.f.
Wanninayake said that under the Dematagala tank, 32 smaller tanks could be provided with water. Under the second phase of the project, the ancient anicuit across the Hawan Ela is to be renovated and a feeder canal of nearly 5 km from this point up to the Dematagala tank is to be constructed.
Once the work is over, 1,380 acres of paddy could be cultivated in the Maha season, while during the Yala season, 500 acres could be cultivated with paddy and additional crops. Nearly 1,800 farmer families will benefit.
It will help to minimise the human - elephant conflict which has been developing in this zone. Rajangana irrigation engineer's office will coordinate the project and estimates for the construction work in relation to the project are being prepared. Anuradhapura Zonal Irrigation Director Prasanna Silva said that the wild elephant threat is to be addressed before start the project.
He said that one has to walk nearly 3 km through thick forest from Kahalla to the Dematagala tank area; as such the first step will be the construction of a suitable approach road from Kahalla junction to the Dematagalla tank site.

Eighty percent samples, toxin-free
The Government Analyst's Department recently inspected selected fruit and vegetable samples from all 25 districts in the country and assessed that 80 percent of those samples were toxin-free. The rest of the samples (20 percent), had chemicals below the danger (approved) level, Deputy Director General (Public Health) Dr. Lakshman Gamlath said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo, yesterday, he said that although majority of the public believe that there are toxins such as pesticides and insecticides in fruits and vegetables available in the country, it was not so. Fruits and vegetables are safe to consume. But this inspection would continue island-wide, in order to ensure the safety of food consumed by people.
According to Dr. Gamlath, this year, arrangements would be made to test all fruits, vegetables, rice and other common food items from all parts of the country for pesticides, insecticides and heavy metals. Therefore, food safety could be ensured. The required standard had already been certified for a total of 101 food items.
"There are four current laboratories in the country that test food. The laboratory located in Anuradhapura tests food for heavy metals, while the laboratory at Kalutara tests for chemicals. The Government Analyst's Department tests food for insecticides. Through the recent inspections, the safety of food has been ensured under Food Act Number 26 of 1980," he added.

Fresh cabinet by April 14
A new cabinet under the theme of One Leader, One Program and One Government will be sworn in by April 14, Co-cabinet spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
He added that this would not be just another reshuffle.
Addressing the weekly cabinet media briefing at the Government Information Department, the Minister explained that some ministries would be restructured in a scientific manner but it would be difficult to do so for all.
The Secretaries to the President and Prime Minister, Minister Senaratne said were working together to restructure these ministries.
The main changes in cabinet however would take place in the portfolios currently held by the six SLFP ministers who voted against the Prime Minister at the recently held No-Confidence Motion (NCM), added the Minister.
He said the President had informed them that the six SLFP ministers had decided to leave cabinet and that their posts would be filled with six other SLFPers to form a new cabinet.
Our stance has been that those who voted against the Prime Minister, cannot continue to remain in the cabinet.
This week, SLFP Cabinet ministers boycott the meeting and according to Minister Senaratne, they had done so, in order to come to a collective decision on the way forward for the party.
The SLFP Central Committee is expected to convene this evening (11) and take a decision on what they will do as a group. We are awaiting their decision, he added.

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) had made plans to meet President Maithripala Sirisena in order to hold a discussion on the need to maintain the current Glyphosate ban, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing the media in Colombo, yesterday, he said a second illegal Glyphosate stock had arrived at the Colombo Harbour and that Glyphosate should not be allowed to be brought into the country again, on any grounds as Sri Lankan tea would face losses in the International Market.
No one knows what had happened to the Cabinet Sub-Committee appointed to make rec commendations, Aluthge said, adding that tea should be cultivated using the same methods that were implemented prior to the arrival of Glyphosate and other toxic chemicals.
Attention should also be paid to the pollution of water resources due to the use of Glyphosate. More and more Sri Lankan people, especially children, suffer from cancer and kidney diseases due to the consumption of food containing such toxins. Therefore, such chemicals should be banned, he added.

Health DG seeks special committee on security for avurudu
It is advisable to appoint a special committee to ensure the safety of the public, in addition to the organizing committees of Avurudu festivals to be held island-wide in the coming weeks, Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo, he said the organizers of Avurudu festivals should ensure the safety of all participants. They should check the breaks and tyres of bicycles that take part in races, reduce the height of the grease pole, place spring mattresses or similar material on the floor below the greasy pole and other places where Avurudu sports such as pillow fights take place.
There should be a first aid team with the required first-aid in every place where Avurudu festivals take place, he said.
According to Dr. Jasinghe, buses running on short distant routes should not be used for long-distance routes or to go on trips. Such buses may have technical faults and drivers of such buses are not familiar with unfamiliar long distant roads. Such reasons lead to road traffic accidents. Adults should be careful when lightning firecrackers and handling them with children. No one should drive under the influence of liquor, he added.
Since there had been a slight increase in dengue during the last few weeks, families visiting their hometowns should pay special attention to clean them, especially the mosquito breeding sites, he said.

Investors need swift project approvals - Speaker
Investors will come into the country only if quick approval is granted to their project proposals, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
For instance the Shanghai Investment zone in China provides a one day service for project proposals. A project proposal submitted in the morning gains approval the same afternoon. I did not believe in it at first. But later I realised that seeing is believing, Speaker Jayasuriya said addressing a meeting after inaugurating the third stage of the Sethsiripaya development scheme of the Megalopolis Development plan.
It was initiated by the UDA under the Megalopolis and Western Development Ministry yesterday.
The Speaker said as opined by Megalopolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawake, people everywhere had a right to obtain an efficient service to them. When people visit a hospital they should receive an expeditious service including the issuing of drugs.
Similary, people visiting a railway station or bus station should be provided with a efficient service to travel to their destinations.
If people having railway season tickets cannot reach the station to board a train on time, it was a denial of their fundamental rights. According to available reports thousand or more strikes and demonstrations had been conducted last year for frivolous reasons. The Speaker said government servants in Sri Lanka had only 250 working days per year. Sri Lanka was a country enjoying the largest number of public holiday per year in the whole world.
In foreign countries there was a single government servant per every 250 people. But in Sri Lanka there was a government servant per every 15 members of the population. The people had a right to obtain a quick service when they visited a government office.
He said they hoped to bring all independent commissions under one roof at Sethsiripaya soon.
The government objective was to provide an apolitical service to the public. The independent Commissions were rendering a praiseworthy service to the people.
The Right to Information Act had hoped to eliminate waste to a large extent.
The Speaker said Sri Jayawardhanapura will regain its ancient grandeur with the completion of the development projects undertaken by the Ministry.
The Megalopolis and Western Development Minister said the Parliament building had brought a new vista to the ancient Kotte Kingdom which is now called Sri Jayawardhanapura.
Their intention was to shift all government departments to the Sri Jayewardhanapura city, Already 40 institutions had applied to shift into the city. Several buildings have been planned to accommodate them. He had been able to transform the UDA into a financially strong independent institution during the last two years.
The entire investment of Rs. 15 billion in the building project launched yesterday would be borne by the UDA.
They also hoped to build several new road networks this year. This would include a light rail network from Kaduwela to Pettah. US$ 1.4 billion funded by Japan, Secretary Megalopolis and Western Development Ministry Nihal Rupasinghe, UDA Director General Sumedha Ratnayake and other officials were also present.

Addressing the media yesterday at the JVP Headquarters, JVP Propaganda Secretary Tilvin Silva said most countries celebrate International Workers Day, often referred to as May Day. It is a celebration of labourers and the working class that is promoted by the international labour movement.
This years Vesak falls on May 1, the same day as May Day. Therefore, due to practical reasons, we have decided to hold our main May Day rally in Colombo on May 7. However, respecting the May Day traditions, we have decided to hold a May Day rally in Jaffna to commemorate International Workers Day, he said.
The Propaganda Secretary charged that some political parties hold May Day rallies by completely neglecting May Day traditions in order to fulfill their narrow political objectives.
He further charged that the UNP, SLFP and Mahinda Rajapaksas party have no ethical right to hold May Day rallies and that only the left wing political parties and the labour force have the right to celebrate it. They just hold party rallies by hoisting flags with their party colours and not the red flag or hammer and sickle. They have completely distorted May Day traditions, he said.
The May Day rally of the JVP will be held on May 7 at the BRC grounds with the participation of more than 50,000 JVP activists, he added.

This was the first time that a CBA was conducted in the Indian Ocean Region by the Self-Defense Force.
The aim of the seminar was not only to strengthen the Sri Lankan militarys capability in maritime search and rescue through sharing the JMSDFs knowledge, but also to reconfirm the importance of values such as the Safety, Openness and Transparency in the maritime domain, which is the foundation for regional and world peace and prosperity. Japan attaches importance to the maintenance of stability, based on the rule of law in the Indian Ocean region, which is a strategic area connecting Asia and Africa.
The Japanese government would continue defence cooperation with Sri Lanka through activities such as CBA, the JMSDF ships goodwill visit, people-to-people exchange and consultations in order to promote maritime security in the region.

A group of 64 farmers attached to the Bandagiriya Farmers Association No. 3 who lost their Yala cultivation in 2017 due to restoration work on the Bandagiriya Wewa have been further inconvenienced by the alleged failure on the part of Bandagiriya Agrarian Service officials to provide their fertilizer subsidy on time for the 2017-2018 Maha season.
Farmers said although they had cultivated their lands this season and are about to harvest the crop, officials had still not provided the fertilizer subsidy due for the season.
Farmer W.A. Willington said they submitted their applications for the subsidy to the agricultural research and production officer in the area on December 12, 2017, but they had still not received the due subsidy although they are close to harvesting their crop.
They made representations to the government agent too and he promised to look into it soon, but as yet there has been no remedy. Hambantota District Agriculture Director D.C.A.

Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray, addressing the gathering subsequently to the swearing in of the Acting Chief Minister, said only a general election could resolve the present political crisis in the country.
"There is a crisis within the government, Cabinet and the leading political parties today. These problems cannot be solved within the current political framework. Any solution found within the existing political framework, is most likely to be feeble. This is a socio-political crisis and it is difficult to find a solution, unless a general election is called for," Governor Cooray added.
He further said that it was not the fault of a single individual, but rather, the fault of the entire political structure. The issue could not be resolved by changing individuals.
It is difficult to change the existing system as many politicians think that they will be there forever. It is rare to find politicians who want to do something for the country, Cooray said.
He said, President Sirisena received a large number of votes from United National Party (UNP) supporters during the previous Presidential Election and he is also the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Leader. He has to consider both those facts. But ideally, he has to think about the country first.
My personal opinion is that if any party wants to leave the government, it is best to leave instead of making baseless allegations, he added.

Over 250 killed in Algerian plane crash
Two hundred and fifty seven passengers have been reported killed, after a military plane crashed near the Boufarik airbase outside the Algerian capital, Algiers, media reports said.
Algerian state radio reported on Wednesday that at least 100 passengers were killed in the crash.
The plane, an Ilyushin Il-76, was carrying scores of military troops, according to the reports. Algerie24, a local news website, said the plane was heading to the western Algerian city of Bechar.
Images posted on an Algerian website showed thick smoke billowing from the site of the crash, as several people rushed to help.
The crash at Boufarik would be the worst in Algeria since 2003 when an Air Algerie jet crashed shortly after takeoff from Tamanrasset, killing 102 people. In 2014, more than 70 off-duty military personnel and their family members were killed when a C-130 plane crashed into the Djebel Fertas mountain shortly before it was to land in the northern city of Constantine.
In December 2012, two military jets conducting routine training operations collided in mid air near Tlemcen, in Algerias northwest, killing the pilots of both planes.
A month earlier, a twin-turboprop CASA C-295 military transport aircraft, which was carrying a cargo of paper for the printing of banknotes in Algeria, crashed in southern France.
That plane was carrying five soldiers and a representative of the Algerian central bank, none of whom survived. - AL JAZEERA

Padaviyas thrifty water management yields bountiful harvest
Farmers in Padaviya have been able to combat the prevailing drought by thrifty water management during the Maha season and reap a bountiful harvest.
Around 141,000 farmer families have faced the drought for three consecutive seasons in the Anuradhapura district.
Residential project manager, Padaviya, N. Wasantha, himself a farmer, told the Daily News that the 6,500 farmer families who come under the Padaviya colonisation project succeeded in cultivating the full irrigable landscape of 13,500 acres, despite the prevailing drought, getting a yield of 150-220 bushels of paddy per acre. This commendable achievement was announced by Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake at the recently Anuradhapura district agriculture committee monthly meeting. Padaviya reservoir's water capacity is 85,000 a.f.
The irrigable landscape under the tank is 13,500 acres. Padaviya is located 100 km from Anuradhapura city. The colonisation scheme began in 1950.
The reservoir has no other alternative water supply than rain water. After the crop failures in previous seasons, the farmer families at Padaviya were very discouraged as the water capacity in the tank was at 5,500 a.f., sufficient only to cultivate 1,000 acres out of 13,500 acres. Wanninayake authorised the Padaviya project management committee comprising farmers organisations, officials representing irrigation, agriculture, agrarian service development and the Divisional Secretary to take decisions regarding the water management for cultivation.
We decided to cultivate every inch of the 13,500 acres giving top priority to preserve every drop of water in the tank, irrigating the land at the minimum level, with no conflicts allowed. Even though we faced many challenges, we didn't change our water controlling methodology, having understood the occasions when the paddy plant required water and we provided it in a thrifty manner, Wasantha explained. In a cultivation season with a low rainfall period, 6 acre feet of water is required for cultivating one acre.''
''But under our self-imposed and self-taught water management methodology, we used only 2.1 acre feet per acre. It worked, giving an unexpected paddy harvest, which our farmers never obtained during normal cultivation seasons earlier, Wasantha said.
He said that hereafter the same water management system will be followed at the Padaviya scheme even when the tank is full.
The district agriculture committee headed by Anuradhapura GA has decided to submit a detailed report to the government regarding the Padaviya water management strategy which is exemplary.

Standard packaging for tobacco products
Cabinet this week approved the introduction of Standard Packaging for tobacco products to reduce the appeal of smoking.
The Cabinet paper submitted by Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister, Rajitha Senaratne asked that the standard package have only two colours; black and white, and no other picture or mark can be displayed other than the trade name, product name, quantity of the production and information or mark determined or made compulsory by the Government such as health warnings.
In order to adopt this change, the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act No 27 of 2006 would have to be amended and cabinet directed the Legal Draftsman to make draft the necessary amendments.
Tobacco smoking is estimated to kill 25,000 persons every year and the government from time to time has introduced; pictorial health warnings, the restriction of places where smoking is allowed, banning of advertisements and promotion, rationalization of the tobacco tax structure and nationwide information and education programmes to discourage smoking among the general population.
The Minister in his paper pointed out that cigarette consumption by adult males had decreased from 29 percent in 2011 to around 24 percent in 2015 as a result of the measures above and that his target was to reduce it to 15 percent in next four years.
Australia and the UK which have adopted plain packaging or standard packing together with pictorial health warnings have shown that these steps have contributed to a decline in smoking in the last three years.
