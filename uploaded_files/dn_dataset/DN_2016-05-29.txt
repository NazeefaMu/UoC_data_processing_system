Sri Lanka asked to follow on


Sri Lanka were bundled out for 101, and England has no hesitation in enforcing the follow-on early on the third day of the second test in Durham on Sunday.

The visitors resumed the day on 91 for eight, but 17 minutes later, they were all back in the hut, with Stuart Broad picking up his fourth wicket and James Anderson his third.

Sri Lanka -- trailing the three-match series 1-0 after a humiliating loss inside three days at Headingly last weekend -- are facing another massive loss as none of their top-order batsmen could come to grip with the hosts' fast bowlers and the swinging ball.

Chris Woakes and Broad both finished the second day with three wickets each -- Woakes was especially miserly, conceding only nine runs in his seven overs.
