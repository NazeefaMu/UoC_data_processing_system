Govts policies in resolving power  crisis should be implemented
Policies of the government to resolve the power crisis should be implemented to find solutions to the increasing demand of power without being subjected to the CEB officers arbitrary decisions, Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA) Chairman Ashoka Abayagunawardena yesterday said.
He was delivering a lecture on solution for the power crisis held at the SEMA auditorium.
He said the country would face a severe power issue in March next year provided that ample rain would not fall to the catchment areas of the hydro power plant reservoirs. He said power crisis would be severe by 2023 as major power plants are not being constructed to provide 5 percent annual increase of power demand.
He said the Government has policies to set up renewable energy power plants, mini hydro power plants and so on as solution to the power demands. They have been prevented by the new General Manager bringing about legal points, Abeygunawardena said.
The government should implement them without being subjected to CEB officials arbitrary decisions.

Politicians demagogic  approaches should be defeated
People should defeat the attempts of power hungry Muslim politicians to rouse communal feelings and create clashes in their community, the Patriotic Muslims Brotherhood Organisations Secretary M.H.M.Rizvi said.
He said the aim of several Muslim politicians is to grab Muslim votes to strengthen the political power to carry out their business.
He said the Muslim community must be aware of the situation and join hand with Sinhala and Tamil patriots to build the motherland.
"If all the communities and religious groups want to live in amity in the country, they should feel and act like Sri Lankans forgetting pretty differences, he said. Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said Muslim leaders like T.B. Jayah, Macan Makar, Siddi Lebbe, Razixk Fareed and Alevi Moulana were noble people who respected all communities.
They never criticised others as extremist tribal politicians. Sinhala and Tamil people never called Muslim people as violent extremists in the past," Rizvi said. He said all ethnic groups were living in the country peacefully.
The situation changed with the emergence of power hungry Muslim politicians who turned politics into a business rousing communal feelings for the attraction of Muslim votes.

Re-examine under-utilized tax  incentives to promote R&D
Sri Lanka needs to re-examine and modify under-utilized tax incentives that were put in place a few years ago to promote R&D while encouraging domestic high net worth individuals and firms to enter into angel and venture financing, Rohan Samarajiva, founding Chair of LIRNEasia said.
Sri Lanka needs to foster a mindset conductive to innovation and larger-than-Sri Lanka thinking while enabling closer university-industry collaboration wherein multiple firms in the same industry would work with selected academic units.
He also explained that it is necessary to establish magnet demonstration schools at the secondary level sponsored by associations such as the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and SLASSCOM that will demonstrate innovation-focused learning.
Samarajiva further urged the need to encourage foreign entities with expertise to consider Sri Lanka and legislate to permit a company to have more than 50 shareholders to enable effective crowd-funding platform similar to Kickstarter and Indiegogo.
According to him, Sri Lanka could easily emerge as a regional leader in innovation, home to Sri Lankan and global firms in diverse industries who research, design, innovate and test world-class products and services in a highly competitive business environment.

40 years on
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be felicitated by parliament today to mark his completion of 40 years in politics. The Public Gallery, no doubt, will be packed by well wishers, particularly old UNP supporters of Wickremesinghe, from the Biyagama electorate, to bid him success and many more years of service to the nation. There will also bound to be reminiscence and nostalgic memories of the happenings 40 years ago, when, Samanthurai, the first result announced, heralded the UNP avalanche that ended with the Grand Old Party winning 140 of the 168 seats on offer and an unprecedented five sixth majority.
Much water has flown under the bridge since the fresh faced youth of 28 entered the old parliament by the sea, having won the Biyagama seat by a majority of over 6,500 votes. Young Ranil was immediately thrust into a position of responsibility by being appointed Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs to apprentice under senior stalwart A.C.S. Hameed. He also had the opportunity to work and move with giant figures of the UNP who had been in the legislature when he was just a kid, such as E.L. Senanayake, E.L. B. Hurulle and of course JRJ himself and the knowledge and experience gained, no doubt, stood him in good stead for the long career in politics he embarked upon, since.
Of course it was not a bed of roses all the way. To say that Ranil's was a chequered political career would be a monumental understatement. Forty years is a long time in politics and to survive that long in the game, traversing a path strewn with myriad obstacles, vicissitude and emerge unscathed to adorn the helm of affairs speaks a lot for the resilience and resourcefulness of Premier Wickremesinghe. He was of course adept at taking the rough with the smooth, as demonstrated by the many comebacks he made after being written off as a has been and consigned to history. He also demonstrated that he was not a man in a hurry and bided his time until the beckoning of destiny. The dividends no doubt paid off, given his gradual emergence as a matured politician with the passage of time and now a leader of international stature.
There was no leader in Sri Lanka who was insulted, reviled, ridiculed and slandered as Ranil Wickremesinghe, in the post independence Sri Lanka, but showing true leadership qualities and displaying the patina of a true Buddhist he took them all with equanimity and philosophically. He displayed his cultured upbringing and rich pedigree by respecting the views of others and not resorting to abuse of his opponents, however much provoked. His responses were always measured, often laced with wit and humour during parliament debates. A true gentleman to the core, he always held himself with calm dignity, showing the true qualities of a leader.
No doubt Ranil Wicremesinghe occupies a special place in the post independence history of Sri Lanka as an innovative leader with modern thinking and vision for the country, especially its youth. Calm and composed as always he never lost his cool even amidst the gravest provocation which perhaps riled his opponents even more than anything else. Known for his integrity, fairness and honesty, even his worst critics will concede that Wickremesinghe is above board in matters of propriety and never compromised his values and ethical standards.
He is today the Lankan politician who held the office of Prime Minister the most number of times.
Of course prior to the present one, all his tenures were truncated ones. The first occasion was a period of one and half years following the demise of President Premadasa. Though elected to office again as Premier in 2001, parliament was terminated by CBK after two years. He was sworn in again as PM in 2105 with the victory of President Sirisena and was elected to parliament in August that year to be made PM once more.
His opportunity to become the Executive President was thwarted twice, on both occasions curtsy the LTTE. The first time was when an LTTE female suicide bomber blew herself up at Town Hall blinding Chandrika in one eye and in the process unleashing a wave of sympathy in the South. The last occasion was when Prabhakaran engineered a voter boycott in the North and East in 2005, paving the way for Mahinda Rajapaksa to be President.
Premier Wickremesinghe, though, was unfazed by these setbacks and typically took them in his stride, not blaming the other side or making wild allegations, which, no doubt, went a long way towards enhancing his political stock.
Monumental challenges confronting the country lie ahead which needs the statecraft and undoubted skills of the Premier. President Sirisena will depend heavily on his PM to resurrect the country from the economic quagmire it has been consigned to by greedy politicians. With four decades of experience behind him Premier Wickremesinghe, no doubt, will be up to the task to ensure a turnaround of things soon, taking the country on the road to progress and prosperity.

77 Indian fishermen released by Sri Lanka arrive in Tamil Nadu

Seventy-seven Tamil Nadu fishermen, arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy in separate incidents this year on charges of poaching, arrived at the Karaikal port early today after their release by the island nation.
Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar, Handlooms Minister O S Manian and family members and relatives of the fishermen were among those who received them at the port, official sources said.
The fishermen belonged to Pudukottai, Ramanathapuram, Nagapattinam and Karaikal districts.
The Sri Lankan Government had on July 28 agreed to release the fishermen.
The Sri Lankan Navy handed over the fishermen to Indian authorities near the International Maritime Boundary Line yesterday.
Escorted by the Indian Coast Guard, the fishermen reached the Karaikal port early today, the sources said.
On March 8, Sri Lanka and India had agreed to release fishermen held in each other's custody after a high-level discussion between the two sides in Colombo in a bid to defuse the tension following the killing of a 22-year-old fisherman belonging to Rameswaram allegedly by the Sri Lankan Navy.
The fisherman, Bridgo, was shot dead on March 6 while he was fishing in a mechanised boat at a short distance off Katchatheevu islet. (Economic Times)

Arts can help recovery from illness
GPs prescribing arts activities to some patients could lead to a dramatic fall in hospital admissions and save the NHS money, according to a report into the subject of arts, health and wellbeing published after two years of evidence gathering. The report, published on Wednesday, includes hundreds of interviews and dozens of case studies showing how powerfully the arts can promote health and wellbeing.
Co-chaired by former arts ministers Alan Howarth and Ed Vaizey, the all-party inquiry contends that the arts can keep people well, aid recovery from illness, help people live longer, better lives and save money in health and social services.
Lord Howarth said it was a comprehensive review of evidence that had never been produced before. Sceptics say where is the evidence of the efficacy of the arts in health Where is the evidence of the value for money it can provide We show it in this report.
The arts can help people take responsibility for their own health and wellbeing in ways that will be crucial to the health of the nation.
The report was welcomed by the arts minister, John Glen, appointed five weeks ago. He pledged to act on its recommendations, saying: This sort of work isnt window dressing, please dont be cynical about it. It gives a dataset and some real stories that we can use as we go through the treacle of Whitehall.
The case studies include an Artlift arts-on-prescription project in Gloucestershire where patients with a wide range of conditions, from depression to chronic pain to stroke, were referred to an eight-week course involving poetry, ceramics, drawing, mosaic or painting.
A cost-benefit analysis showed a 37% drop in GP consultation rates and a 27% reduction in hospital admissions. That represents an NHS saving of 216 per patient. -.theguardian.com

Batsmen expose frailties in Lankan bowling: Pujara, Rahane bat India  into dominant position
Cheteswar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane scored unbeaten centuries apiece and batted India into a dominant position on the opening day of the second cricket Test against Sri Lanka at the SSC grounds yesterday.

The pair came together at the fall of Indian captain Virat Kholis wicket for 13 at 133-3 and was still there together at the close when India finished on 344 for three wickets after winning the toss and batting first.
What these two batsmen have exposed is the limitations in the Lankan bowling attack which they played with ease during their 308-ball liaison unfinished stand of 211 that is just 20 runs shy of the highest ever for the wicket at the SSC. Although there was some assistance from the wicket which seemed two-paced at times with certain balls taking off from a good length and others turning sharply Sri Lanka simply didnt have that extra edge in their bowling to exploit the pitch which as the day went by has started to slow down. It would be interesting to see how the Indians bowl on it.
When Shikhar Dhawan was at the crease one could feel the run rate racing, but even without him India still managed to maintain a rate of nearly four runs an over with Pujara and Rahane batting with such serenity that one hardly felt that they were scoring runs. It was suddenly when you look up at the scoreboard that you see how quietly and efficiently they had racked up the runs without much fanfare.
The afternoon session India ran up 137 despite losing the wickets of Lokesh Rahul run out for 57 over a bad mix-up with Pujara and Kohli, and in the final session 106 without losing a single wicket. This was Test cricket at its best with the number one ranked team laying the foundations to build a huge first innings score that is always vital for the end result. At Galle India batted first and ran up 600 and won by 304 runs, a similar score is likely here with only three wickets down.
How comfortable the Indian batsmen played the Lankan bowling can be gauged by the fact that no catches came to hand but several edges fell short of the close-in fielders.
The way Pujara and Rahane negotiated the Lankan bowling was a lesson for the Lankan batsmen that once you have got your eye in you dont simply throw away your wicket but go for a big score. Both these batsmen are set to continue today from where they have left off.
Pujara is unbeaten on 128 scored off 225 balls (10 fours, 1 six), his 13th Test century, third against Sri Lanka and second at the SSC and, Rahane is 103 not out scored off 168 balls (12 fours), his ninth Test hundred and second against Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka who went into this Test with just one frontline fast bowler Nuwan Pradeep suffered a mild shock when he was forced off the field clutching his left hamstring after bowling just four balls of the second new ball. The over was completed by left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara who on his debut finished with figures of none for 82 off 19.2 overs.
The danger here is whether Pradeep will be able to resume bowling in the match today as Sri Lanka have no back-up seamer having gone into this Test with a three-prong spin combination.
The two successful bowlers for Sri Lanka were the other two spinners Rangana Herath who accounted for Kohlis wicket and Dilruwan Perera who dismissed the dangerous looking Dhawan for 35 off the first ball he bowled in the innings.

CB Governor says: INVESTOR  CONFIDENCE  strengthened
Revamped BOI focused on attracting anchor investors
Strengthening of government auction system viewed positively
People keen to invest in Sri Lanka, will understand that a lot has been done in strengthening the government auction system and the EPF operations, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said.
The Task Forces on the eight pillars on Ease of Doing Business and a revamped BOI more focused on attracting anchor investors for identified sub-sectors in Sri Lanka, he said will also boost investor confidence. He hoped that investors will look to more than newspaper headlines.
Investor confidence has not been shaken by the Treasury Bond issue, Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said yesterday in answer to fears that the long drawn out issue might have hampered and discouraged foreign investments into the country.
Addressing the media on the recent Monetary Policy Review of the Central Bank, the Governor explained that during his visits to road shows in March this year, the issue had not been raised as a concern by the business community.
Investments however have been slow to come in and despite a good fiscal performance and improving macroeconomic conditions, the Central Bank said they only expected modest recovery in the domestic economy in the period ahead.
As the Central Bank chose to continue with its present tight monetary policy, Dr Coomaraswamy said they did not expect to raise interest rates at a time when growth was below potential and he expected economic growth to be no more than 4.5 percent by the end of this year.
We need investment for economic growth and there are no short cuts for that. We need to create an investor climate and build investor confidence, said the Governor as he stressed that the domestic private sector needed to be more robust for growth to pick up.
There are signs and some of our perception indices are beginning to show that there may be a bit of upturn in business sentiment, he further explained but this sentiment was higher among foreign investors than local,
When you take foreign investors, we have got USD 388 million flowing into our government securities and another USD 246 million into our Stock Exchange. When the ISB was floated in March, it was seven times oversubscribed.
These are positive changes, he said but added that we were yet to see significant FDIs coming in to the country.
The short term money is coming in and that is a good start, next step is for people to be comfortable enough for FDIs to come in, explained Governor Coomaraswamty as he expected a positive outlook with the initiation of the Colombo Port City and Hambantota Port Agreements.

Bond Commission to sit sans vacation
The Commission investigating the bond issue will be sitting without a vacation to conclude proceedings.
Perpetual Treasuries will commence evidence on August 8. The court vacation begins on August 11.
However, the commission decided yesterday that it will continue to sit throughout the period with no vacation.

CB holds policy rates unchanged
The Monetary Board, at its meeting held on August 2, was of the view that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate and decided to maintain the policy interest rates of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka at their present levels.
In arriving at the above decision, the Monetary Board took into consideration current and expected developments in the domestic and international macroeconomic environment and the need to maintain inflation at mid-single digit levels over the medium term.
The outlook for global growth appears to be firming according to the latest update of the World Economic Outlook of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in July 2017. The Sri Lankan economy is expected to record a modest recovery in the forthcoming quarters following the low growth witnessed in the first quarter of 2017.
The recovery of the agriculture related activities and the positive performance of the industry and services related activities together with the reinstatement of GSP+ facility are expected to contribute to economic growth.
The Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100) and the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100) based headline inflation (year-on-year) moderated at a faster pace in the recent months, in spite of supply side disruptions encountered in May 2017, mainly on account of the floods.
A similar trend was observed in core inflation as well during this period. Inflation is expected to ease further towards the end of 2017 and stabilise thereafter due to the tight monetary policy stance maintained since the end of 2015 and the dissipation of the one-off impact of the tax structure on inflation. However, monetary expansion continued to remain high in May as well as in June 2017.
Meanwhile, private sector credit that was growing at an elevated level during 2016 and early 2017, indicates clear signs of deceleration in recent months, although at a slow pace.
In view of high nominal and real interest rates prevailing in the market, it is expected that growth of monetary and credit aggregates would moderate further during the remainder of the year.
In the external sector, export performance continued to improve in May 2017 led by agricultural exports.
However, the continued increase in expenditure on imports has caused a further widening of the cumulative trade deficit.
Tourist arrivals and earnings from tourism improved in June 2017, albeit at a slower pace, while workers remittances continued to slow during the first half of 2017 on account of prevailing economic and geopolitical uncertainties in the Middle East. Nevertheless, the capital market, both government securities and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), witnessed a noticeable influx of foreign funds (on a net basis) from March 2017.
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka received the third tranche of the IMF-Extended Fund Facility (EFF) amounting to US dollars 167.2 million. Reflecting these developments, gross official reserves stood at US dollars 6.7 billion as at end July 2017.
Renewed investor confidence and anticipated direct investment inflows are expected to further strengthen the external sector outlook.
Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated against the US dollar by 2.6 per cent by end July 2017.
The Monetary Board decided to maintain the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank at their current levels of 7.25 per cent and 8.75 per cent, respectively.

Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transport  held its 15th John Diandas Memorial lecture
The Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transport, Sri Lanka held its 15th John Diandas Memorial Lecture on July 28, 2017 at the Institute of Engineers, Sri Lanka.
The lecture was presented by Rodolfo Martinez who elaborated on the progress of the current study funded by the Asian Development Bank.
He outlined the current status of the suburban network, traffic forecasts and went on to present the engineering details of the project. The first phase would be 70 km section from Panadura to Veyangoda will have 23 stations.
He also revealed that the station to station commercial speed would be around 40 km per hour, once modernized and electrified.
Railway electrification in Sri Lanka has been mooted over several decades by transport professionals and engineers alike.
In recent times, the CoMTRans study funded by JICA also endorsed railway electrification, followed by the validation study by the University of Moratuwa in 2015 which even recommended the possibility of new railway lines to be electrified such as from Kelaniya to Kosgama. The Megapolis Transport Plan also confirmed electrification.
Martinez presentation was followed by a panel discussion where I was joined by Palitha Samarasinghe, Project Director, Railway Electrification Project and Dr. Tilak Siyambalapitiya, Member of Institution of Engineers Committee on Railway Electrification.
The audience raised many questions on the details of the project and made a number of constructive suggestions for consideration in the next stage of the detailed feasibility study and design.
The discussion included the consideration of the freight services and infrastructure required especially for the movements of port related cargo, the consideration of railway station development as integrated transit oriented development with private sector participation, the improvement of access to the stations and the calculation of future demand under a low, medium and high growth scenario so that investment can be justified.
Samarasinghe said that some of these factors could not be considered under the current scope of study and agreed that they can be included in the feasibility study and design stage.
He also revealed that the ADB is to mobilize another study to investigate the modernization of the railway network in suburbs of Kandy.
Funding was also sought for station development. There were also inquiries from the audience on the adequacy of the electricity supply and on the potential for using renewable sources for back-up power stations.
Dr. Siyambalapitiya responded stating that the railway electrification would require only around 1% of the current supply and that renewable sources could only be used as a supplementary source of power.
It was stated that the electrified railway serving five different corridors in Colombo will have the potential to carry over 1.4 million passengers per day by the year 2035 and that additional tracks would be necessary in some sections as the demand grows.
The electrification project also proposes to ensure modernization of the railways including modern carriages, electronic ticketing, improved signaling and communications etc. Railway crossings would also be made safer.
The seamless rail, improved track and ballasting will ensure a much more comfortable ride. Railway electrification is seen as the long term solution to road congestion with the modernized railway being able to attract private vehicle users to a higher quality service.
This project scheduled to enter the construction phase in 2018 would be a major boost to modernizing Sri Lankas urban transport and a primary means of positioning public transport to manage road congestion.

China celebrates PLA day
China will celebrate the 90th Anniversary of the Founding of the Peoples Liberation Army of China on August 1. In line with this, Chinese Embassy in Colombo held the PLA Day reception recently at the Galle Face Hotel with the participation of the state minister of defence, Ruwan Wijewardene.
The Peoples Liberation Army of China was formed on August 1, 1927 and at that time was called the workers and peasants revolutionary army. In 1927, the struggle between the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist Party of China reached its climax. Those who disagreed with the Chiang Kai-sheks policy, formed a revolutionary communist bloc rousing the people to revolt in Nanchang.
The Communist Party of China upon establishing its authority decided to immortalize this day in history, awarding it a status of a national holiday. In 1946 the workers and peasants army was renamed into the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army. At present the PLA consists of the air and naval as well as ground forces, and also engineering corps of China. Pictures by Sulochana Gamage

Comment on allegations against Ravi UNPs responsibility: Minister Musthapha
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha yesterday, declining to comment on allegations against Minister Ravi Karunanayake, said that it is the responsibility of the UNP to react to them.
Minister Musthapha, responding to questions by journalists at a press conference at the SLFP Headquarters, said the SLFP would articulate its stance on the findings of Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on the Bond issue once its proceedings are over.
The commission is still sitting. I am a lawyer and Presidents Counsel by profession. It is not ethical for me to make any statement at this stage. Lets wait till the commission concludes its inquiry, the minister said.
Finding himself in a swirl of questions, Musthapha replied, In any government, there can be thieves. It has been the case with all successive governments in the country.
Asked what would be the SLFP stance if a No Confidence Motion against Karunanayake was presented, Musthapha said it would be decided at that time.
The minister, however, highlighted that it was the Presidents initiative to set up the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) which paved the way for the latest revelations.

The Constitutional Steering Committee will finalise the Interim Report during their next round of meetings from August 8 to 10, a senior member of the Steering Committee told the Daily News yesterday.
He said they went through 90 percent of the draft at the last weeks meeting and decided to attach differing views on certain sections in the Interim Report as annextures so that they can be addressed at the next level of discussions.
Hopefully, we can wrap up the process by the next round of deliberations, the senior member said.
The members and parties that are holding different views other than what has been proposed in the interim report will be given an opportunity to so as not to drag the process. However, he said the SLFP holds on to the opinion that the Executive Presidency should be retained.
They are ready to scale down some of the executive powers enjoyed by the office of the President, but insist that he should be directly elected by the people.
The other leading parties in the Constitutional Assembly, including the UNF JVP and the ITAK are of the view that the Executive Presidency should be abolished. The President must be selected by Parliament. But they agree that the President should have certain powers over the Provincial Councils.
This is unfortunate and could serve as a stumbling block to the future of the Constitution making process, he said.

He said that the reason they invested on a new warehouse in Sri Lanka for export consolidation operations. We also see an upward trend in our growth in Sri Lanka and this will continue in the future as well
He said that globe trade is now moving to Asia and said that both India and China would play a major role in this regard. This too would boost the logistic sector in Sri Lanka.
The Warehouse which is located in Ja-Ela, in close proximity to the Katunayake Free Trade Zone will operate as the primary export consolidation center for local Garment manufacturers who supply to Global Brands such as Nike, Walmart, Tesco, Adidas etc. The warehouse has a capacity receive, store and consolidate export cargo up to 2000 Pallet positions at a given time.

Death of doyen of  swimming Tara Bolling
Tara Bolling a name synonymous with swimming in Sri Lanka passed away at the age of 76 on Wednesday. Her funeral will take place at the General Cemetary, Borella today at 4.30 pm.
The name Bolling and swimming are intertwined. It was Tara who set the platform for swimming to make a landmark in the countrys history - a practice which her three sons Jeremy, David and Julian pursued with distinction.
The daughter of former Sri Lanka cricket captain F.C. de Saram and Needra de Saram, Tara was educated at Bishops College but her interests did not lie so much with education but in swimming where at an early age she was coached in Australia.
Tara represented Sri Lanka (Ceylon then) in the 400 metres freestyle at meets held in India and at the Asian Games in Tokyo and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff.
After quitting from competitive swimming she continued in the sport as a coach. The hall mark of her coaching was discipline which she instilled in her three sons who were successful swimmers as well as coaches. Julian was the most celebrated of the trio going onto win 15 gold medals at the South Asian Games and representing the country at three Olympic Games. Tara was married to late Ralph Bolling.
In 1988, Ralph Bolling along with Tara Bolling, and David founded the Rainbow Swimming Aquatic Club at the Army Pool where David coached the senior swimmers. In 2001, Julian and David started the Rainbow Swimming Academy (Pvt.) Ltd at the NCC. The Bollings continued to expand their coaching programs by commencing a Learn to Swim Program at the NCC, CH & FC (CCC), Austasia and at the Premadasa Riding School.

Dis IT bag

First, there was the Kelly bag, named by Hermes after Princess Grace of Monaco in 1977. Then in 1984 came the Birkin, the Hermes tote designed for English actress Jane Birkins busy life as film star, mother and fashion icon.
After that, couture houses largely stopped naming bags after glamorous clients  until Diana became a truly international star in the Nineties.
Two brands are still making fortunes from the bags she carried: Diors Lady Dior and Ferragamos Lady D chain-strapped shoulder bag are classics  and remain marketed in her name.
Diana was always a bag connoisseur. As a young bride-to-be, she loved the informal quilted bags in sunny Provencale prints sold by fabric shop Souleiado on Londons Fulham Road, once buying five in different floral designs for 30 each. Later, she followed the example set by the Queen  the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret, too  whose day bags, made by Royal Warrant holder Launer, stand as a symbol of monarchy.
The rule here was the co-ordination of an outfit. As the Sloane Ranger Handbook summed up in 1980: Any well brought-up girl tends to think, as she was taught to, in terms of matching shoes and bags.
At first, this formal way of dressing proved a daunting task. Designer David Sassoon recalls Diana arriving in tears at his Bellville Sassoon studio after her 1981 wedding rehearsal at St Pauls: Its all too much! she wailed.
Shed ordered her going-away outfit from him, but realised she didnt have a bag to go with it. Sassoon set about making one.
But Diana was a quick learner, and as a young princess she complied with the matchy-matchy royal rules. To get a precise colourmatch, her discreet evening envelope-style bags were often made by her dressmakers rather than designer handbag firms.
Yet in 1990 she began buying from Italian brand Salvatore Ferragamo. Diana had more than 20 calfskin Ferragamo bags with distinctive gold-hooped Gancio clasps, retrospectively named the Lady D.
By the mid-Nineties, an emboldened Diana side-stepped royal protocol completely by wearing foreign couture labels. Her bag wardrobe took in Dior, Versace, Chanel and Gucci. It was among these labels that the Bag Wars of the 2000s were launched.
If Launer represented established royal protocol  a brand Diana perhaps pointedly never carried  the glossy European status bag was a symbol of independence after her separation from Prince Charles.
Chanel - her first foreign label
As the most famous of Parisian fashion houses, Chanel was one of the first foreign labels Diana was able to wear.
Royal protocol  which normally demanded she sport British-made bags and clothing  allowed the Princess of Wales to wear Chanel as a tribute to her hosts on a visit to France.
She was seen in a red coat with classic, quilted chain-bag from the fashion house, on her official visit there in 1988.
Though she looked self-conscious that day, Chanel bags, especially those which had a chain strap, remained very much a part of her own private wardrobe, particularly in the post-Charles years.
For one of her final public appearances, left, speaking in support of the Red Cross landmine campaign in Washington in June 1997, she chose to wear a white quilted top-handle Chanel bag with her business-like lilac Versace suit.
And her shoes Chanel, of course.
Versace - A mark of friendship
Forward to the mid-Nineties and Diana was moving in different circles. Surrounded by fashion sophisticates including Liz Tilberis, editor of U.S. Harpers Bazaar, Vogue photographer Mario Testino and designer Gianni Versace (whom she met through her relationship with Elton John and their work for Aids charities) Diana began to epitomise pared-down chic.
It was the beginning of a new international jet-set aesthetic that still prevails today  simple, colour-blocked clothes, worn with luxe hero bags.
Now, her accessories didnt have to match all of the time  in fact, they often looked cooler when they didnt.
Her glossy Versace bags, for example, often lifted her sleek tailoring. She was carrying a black version, left, when she went to the Duomo in Milan for Gianni Versaces memorial service. Her friend had been murdered in Miami in July 1997  just over a month before she lost her own life in Paris.
Dior - Lady Dior just for Diana
Originally a diplomatic gift from a visit to Paris in 1995, the Lady Dior bag was a major score for the French LVMH luxury company.
If not exactly designed for her, the cane-patterned, patent bag with its gilt hardware and double handles was a prototype only Diana could initially be seen with.
Rather than being simply delivered by a Christian Dior PR, however, the bag was presented to Diana by Bernadette, wife of French President Jacques Chirac, at the Grand Palais in Paris.
It was the fateful year of Dianas Panorama interview and her marriage was well and truly over. Any qualms she once had about being seen with foreign-made fashion brands were fast fading.
When Dior speedily rolled out the bag to its stores, Diana stocked up with plenty more. She is seen above with a black one in 1996.
The popularity of the bag, now re-christened Lady Dior, skyrocketed, and it became a best-selling house classic. It is still available for about 3,000 today.
D Clutch
Dianas bags were deployed as protective devices.
As her evening wear necklines got lower and sexier, she worked out how to dip out of cars with what she called her cleavage bag clutched across her chest to avoid any unfortunate photographs.
The young designer she called on to create them was Anya Hindmarch. They were in satin, Anya remembers. We embroidered a D inside for her.

Do your homework before investing - Iconic Developments Executive Director
Sri Lankas real estate sector is entering an unprecedented new phase in its development as residential and commercial properties spring up across the island, concentrated primarily in the Colombo district.
However, faster paced growth brings with it many notable challenges for the wary investor or aspiring home owner.
Delving into the varied opportunities and risks associated with the Sri Lankan market, Iconic Developments Ltd. Executive Director, Pranav Desai sat down to discuss how a cautiously planned investment can yield enormous value and some key areas to watch out for when entering the Sri Lankan real estate sector.
Q: What is your outlook on the Sri Lankan real estate sector
A: We at Iconic Developments are very bullish on the real estate sector in Colombo. We strongly feel this is a great time to buy, particularly given that the Government has removed tax benefits for real estate firms which will almost certainly drive prices upwards, particularly on developments that havent yet commenced.
Colombo has an inherently strong demand for quality affordable luxury housing and so the trend towards vertical living will continue and it is fundamental strengths in the Sri Lankan market like this that drove us to recently launch our second development in the country in the form of Iconic Galaxy at Rajagiriya.
When investing however, we would advise buyers to really do their homework and pay careful attention to the credentials of a developer.
This is a crucial factor for investors and there are certainly examples even over the recent past of less credentialed developers hastily constructing properties and compromising on quality and unfortunately, sometimes even safety standards.
The growth that the Sri Lankan market is currently experiencing means that there will be a period of time over which the quality of these kinds of developers will be tested and eventually, only those which are able to truly demonstrate quality in their work will survive.
However in the time it takes for this initial period of risk to dissipate, prices are sure to rise. Hence we believe that the Sri Lankan market is truly at a unique point in its development.
Q: What are some of the key factors that a smart investor should look for when choosing a property to invest in
A: Some of the key factors that should first be considered would be the location of the property, price for the size and amenities offered and of course, the credibility of the developer.
When making an investment, a home owner or an investor has to essentially put their faith in the developer for a product which in truth, will only be developed and delivered over an extended period of time.
This gestation period - which is inherent to every real estate development project - means that the credibility of the developer is absolutely crucial when considering an investment into any real estate project.
Taking ourselves as an example, Iconic Developments is a subsidiary of ANPG, which was established in 1947. We have strong roots which spread out into a diversified range of sectors including transport, logistics, shipping, hospitality and education.
Over the years, our real estate arm has carried out numerous projects across the globe spanning luxury residences, commercial and office developments, clubs and hotels. Iconic Developments is a company which is incorporated in Sri Lanka and we have already successfully completed one of Rajagiryas most impressive residential properties in the form of Iconic 110 Parliament Road which sold out 172 apartments within the span of just two years.
We were the first in the market to provide luxury at an affordable price and Im pleased to say that our home owners and investors earned great return on their investment.
Our record is the best evidence that we can provide to show that we are passionately committed towards establishing the highest quality vertical living option in Colombo and it is factors like these about a developer's record which must be carefully evaluated prior to investing.
Given the relative lack of maturity in the Sri Lankan market when it comes to extensive real estate development, I would also recommend that investors also take the time to learn more about how smart financing strategies can also help streamline the investment process.
Q: How do you think high interest rates will affect the real estate sector
A: Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for owners as well as the developers, which can have a constraining effect on the real estate market. Fluctuations in real estate that are tied to interest rate movements are of course something that is typical in any market.
That being said, we are also aware that higher interest rates will not last long and this too shall tide over in the coming years.
Given ANP Groups extensive experience in this industry across the globe over the past seven decades, we are of course well acquainted with these macroeconomic scenarios and have built up the capacity to absorb the disparity of the volatile market trends. Similarly, we have also worked to assist potential home owners and investors tide over this high home loan rate through a unique 30:70 payment plan.
The potential home owner needs to put in 30% as a down payment and pay the remaining 70% on completion of the project and this is just one of the steps which we have taken towards mitigating current conditions for our buyers.
Q: Given that this type of plan has not really been offered in Sri Lanka as it has in other markets you operate in, could you explain how the 30:70 works
A: For any investor, this is an ideal deal, as they need to pay only 30% upfront and balance 70% only on completion of the project. Thus, the investor remains stress free from multiple payment plans and has actually locked an asset at a fraction of the cost. At just 30% investment he has created an asset and balance 70% is payable only when the project is completed.
He is free from financial stress and can use his extra money for other investments. The investment is safe, secure and the risk is limited to the initial down payment.
To explain this better - lets take a hypothetical scenario in case of Iconic Galaxy home owner, where Mr. X, a home owner, takes a home loan.
He would need to pay 30% of the amount upfront and the balance 70% is disbursed by the bank as per the payment plan which is usually linked to the slab construction. As soon as the first installment is disbursed, the bank starts charging an interest even though the project would take four years to complete.
However, with our 30:70 scheme, Mr. X would be paying only the 30% amount upfront and would feel the need for a home loan only towards the completion of our project, as his 70% payment is due on completion.
In this case, he can push his home loan requirement need by four years. This helps him save on interest costs and gives him enough time to plan and rebuild his finances before the EMI starts.
Q: Overall, how would you compare your experience as a developer in Sri Lanka as compared to other markets around the globe
A: The Sri Lankan market certainly presents its own unique challenges and especially compared to markets like Singapore and the Middle East, it can be challenging from a regulatory standpoint.
However, we also have extensive experience working in the Indian market and having established a strong foothold in the Sri Lankan market with Iconic 110 Parliament Road, we believe we are gaining a much greater familiarity with the local market.
This combined with the inherent strengths that Colombo has to be a truly unique, vibrant, international city means that over the medium to long term, people could well be asking us about our experience as developers in Sri Lanka as a case study for what to do correctly. It all depends on execution and quality.

EKHO ROYAL LAKE TOUR
Juliet Coombe goes bird watching early morning on the Sea of King Parakrama, one of the largest man-made lakes in the world and as the early morning mist lifts like a magic curtain she is rewarded with birds dancing over the islands where the royal summer palaces sit.
EKHO Lake House Polonnaruwa overlooks the huge tank of water built in the 12th century and on the other side of the hotel is the medieval capital dating back to the 6th Century. King Parakramabahu The Great reigning from 1153 built this giant lake that has made the area so famous and an excellent way to see it is to go fishing and bird watching on what can only be described as a vital source of water to the surrounding farms.
A few stylishindulgences
Today this splendid man made lake built by King Parakrama provides water for the worlds largest elephant gathering in the dry season, many species of birds including the cormorants and the playful monkeys that live inside this historic site, now very well known due to the highly successful Walt Disney film, as the Monkey Kingdom. Built as both a moat to protect the royal citadel from intruders and to provide an advanced irrigation system with one aim to make the area totally self sufficient and an example to the world on many different subjects from medicine to engineering.
EKHO Lake House say it is no wonder the royal wish of Queen Elizabeth 11 on her visit in 1954 shortly after being crowned Queen was to stay here, where Kings audience halls, council chambers and bathing ponds are within eyesight of this wonderfully situated property.
With EKHO Lake House wings named after past kings of this ancient city, Parakramabahu, Nissankamalla and Vijayabahu, it is reminiscent of how surrounded by Royalty you are when you book the hotels top selling room the Royal Suite. From the moment you arrive you are treated like royalty, which ever room you book, and nothing is too much trouble for this dynamic and inspiring team. So pick from the portfolio of 14 elegantly re-furbished rooms and enjoy the magic of this lake civilisation to the full by staying four or five days.
Of course for that special event nothing beats the room Queen Elizabeth herself stayed in, which overlooks the lake on two sides and still has the royal bathtub in dull gold, and now half a century later the group has added a few stylish indulgences like an outdoor Jacuzzi so you can sip champagne under the stairs and enjoy the lake in all its glory at anytime of the day.
A great chance
The best way to see King Parakramabahus fabulous garden city is at water level by going out with the fishing community in a rowing boat. You can either enjoy bird watching early morning combined with seeing some of the ruined palaces on the islands dotted around the lake or spend a few hours doing a spot of fishing on a catamaran, which can be combined with learning to cook royal dishes in the plot to plat special experience for those that love hands on foodie experiences.
After the fabulous boat ride around the lake you will be taken around Dishans fishing village on the opposite side of the lake, see a Catholic church, buy some fresh fish to cook in the evening from one of the local singer fishing bike sellers, and eat breakfast fit for a King and freshly prepared in a typical home garden setting. It is a great chance to ask about life around the lake, ancient traditions, and just how do the community live along side the wild elephants that drink from the lake daily early morning and late afternoon. One fisherman amused us with stories of how one elephant smelt wood apple and swam out to get some from his boat. He was terrified as the elephant loomed over his fishing vessel larger than life and thought his number was up, but luckily not that day.
Whether you end up playing cricket with the staff on the beach below the hotel as the sun sets over the lake, or indulge in a unforgettable cream tea while sitting on the rocks where they made the columns for the royal palaces. Every curated experience is excellent and includes unique personal touches like a flute player serenading you from a boat in the evening, live piano music while you enjoy a four course fine dinning experience in the restaurant named Rasa Musu. This simply means a blend of perfect aromatic spices and ingredients like lake fish sprinkled with flawless finishing touches. Soul satisfying cuisine that is not only delicious but feeds the mind with the beauty of the lake that is poetically described as of such a width that it is impossible to stand upon one shore and view the other side.

The far-reaching impact of investment treaties on intellectual property
Investment Treaties on Intellectual Property (IP) are agreements between countries to attract foreign direct investmentsby exploiting IP while providing benefits which are subject to the agreed terms and conditions upon them. In other words, investment treaties are encouraging investment between states and non-government organisations.
There are many types of investment treaties including bilateral, multilateral and regional ones. This article discusses the impact of Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) and Regional Investment Treaties (RITs) upon IP. BITs are made between two countries whereas RITs are made among several countries within a region.The Latter may sometimes have been referred as investment chapters of Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs). BITscould sometimes exist in the form of a free trade agreement (FTA) like US-CanadaNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement(CETA).
Although intellectual property rights are territorial, investment treaties could lift them up to create bilateral and regional economic relationships to have competitive advantages by mutual exploitation of innovations. Sri Lanka has become party to number of investment treaties on IP including 2001 India-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (FTA), 1993 USA-Sri Lanka BIT on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, 1991 USA-Sri Lanka BIT on Agreement on the Protection and Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), 1982 Japan-Sri Lanka BIT on Concerning the Promotion and Protection of Investment. In addition, we are party to several Regional Economic Integration Treaties such as 2006 Agreement on South Asian Free Trade Area, 2004 Framework Agreement on the BIMST-EC Free Trade Area, 1989 Global System of Trade Preferences among Developing Countries, 1985 Charter of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and 1976 First Agreement on Trade Negotiations among Developing Member Countries of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.
The advantages accruable fromsuch treaties
There are many advantages of Investment Treaties on IP for both developed and the developing countries. For instance, if USA and Sri Lanka have a BIT on a patented pharmaceutical drug, the latter couldseek price benefits while the former could insist to prohibit compulsory licences during the agreed period. First, the developed countries could use BITs not only including the provisions based on agreement on Trade-Related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)but alsoTRIPS-plus provisions to maintain a higher standard in which they are interestedand bring significant revenue by exporting IP.Secondly, developing and the Least Developed Countries (LDC) couldachieve significant benefits from investment treaties because they depend on many innovations generated in the developed world to satisfy their basic needs like public health, agriculture and genetic resources.
On the other hand, innovations are created by using inventors resourcesby following specific inventive steps. Therefore, it would not be unreasonable for the developing countries to accept any reasonable terms and conditions in BITs in order to gain access to essential IP products and services in the developed countries. Although investment treaties are mainly focused on patents, they could also be created to exploit copyrights because the right holder could outsource the publishing work to a publisher in abroad and generate royalty.
Furthermore, when considering the effect of free movement in European Union (EU), it is apparent that it conflicts with the territorial IP rights. Investment treatiescould provide a solution to this by providing certain restrictions or exemptions among the members. In addition, when considering the health sector such treatiescould support more for developing an effective vaccination on diseases like Ebola which had substantially affected on many LDC s. When considering RITs in African countries, they provide numerous benefits among members by expanding market and resources.Not only developing countries, but also developed countries could use investment treaties to create protection of IP for different areas. For instance, in the case of Anheuser-Busch, IncVsBudvar case,the advantages of a BIT between Austria and Czechoslovakia in terms of protecting a trademark was considered in depth.
The negative impact
There would be no significant issues if all the investment treaties contained only minimum standards laid down by TRIPS. Unfortunately, this does not seemto happen at the moment because most of the developed countries tend to insert TRIPS-plus provisions such as providing exclusivity for data, extending patent terms, creating links between patents, prohibiting parallel importation and restricting compulsory licences. For instance, most of the FTAs between EU and the developing countries contain provisions to extend patent terms for medicines.Under these circumstances, number of issues could be found in the area of investment treaties on IP.For instance, the implementing of substantially higher economic standards, has adverse impact on the harmonization of IPand has an adverse effect on the public health among member countries.
First, these treaties may maintain substantially higher economic standards which consequently adversely influence even the non-signatories ofthosetreaties. Consequently, importance of multilateral negotiations under the umbrella of World Trade Organisation (WTO) could be undermined. In addition, despite the long term economic disadvantages, there is a tendency that many developing countries accepting BITs including TRIPS-plus provisions due to short term benefits. For instance, EU and USA have imposed higher patent protection on LDC s in Africa by including TRIPS-plus provisions in investment treaties.
According to the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) principle for the purpose of IP protection, any benefit granted by a WTO member to another shall be accorded immediately and unconditionally to the others. In other words, this principle equalises the granting of privileges among member nations. For instance, if USA and Sri Lanka signs a BIT on IP protection, the same benefits should be offered to the other WTO members subject to the terms and conditions provided in the agreement. When considering the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)and The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), both contain the MFN principle along with an exemption to it.
However, TRIPS does not expressly provide any exemption to the MFN principle, although it was formulated to achieve the principles of GATT. Therefore, such TRIPS-plus investment treaties lead to spread economically higher terms and conditions among the countries which are not signatories of thosetreaties. For instance, a string of investment treatiessigned by developed states like USA and EU could establish new IP standards which consequently prevent the developing countries and LDC srelying on the flexibilities provided by TRIPS. This is not what was truly expected from the TRIPS. For instance, in terms of compulsory licensing in copyrights the licensee has a right to deny the payments on the grounds of unfair terms in the licence.A BIT containing a higher economic standard may sometimes deprive such rights and open a forum for unfair terms. Consequently, entities like Patent Trolls may sometimes try to take advantage from the conflicts arising out of BITs.
Furthermore, it could be harmful if a BITwas created in the manner it could prevent the application of domestic competition laws. As a result of that, set of anti-competitive terms and conditions suchas unfair price fixing, limiting production, the avoidance of selling to potential buyers could be included in the BIT. In addition, there could be a substantial adverse impact if such BIT falls within the scope of Technology Transfer Block Exemption (TTBE) which provides exemption for the agreed parties to avoid any effect from the competition law.
Secondly, investment treatiescouldhave an adverse impact upon the harmonization of IP. The TRIPS agreement has taken an effort to globalize the general principles of IP. According to TRIPS, a balance must be struck between the right holders and the beneficiaries when protecting and enforcing IP.For instance, compulsory licencescould be granted if the patentee refuses to issue a licence on reasonable commercial terms and conditions. In addition, although patentee has a right to commercial exploitation of patent, once it expires anyone could exploit it. These general principles were established by the TRIPS to enable flexibility in the process of harmonization of International IP Law.
However, the investment treaties which contain TRIPS-plus provisions could significantly damage the fundamental character of the aforesaid general principles of IP laid down by TRIPS. For instance, TRIPS-plus agreement might contain a provision to extend the duration of a patent beyond twenty (20) years which would ultimately prevent the public interest to exploit the patent after a reasonable period. The purpose of patent law is not to give an eternal absolute monopoly but to offer a time limited exclusive right to the patentee to commercially exploit the patentand conclude licensing contractsand assignmentssubject to a public disclosure. This limited monopoly is a kind of a reward to encourage him.Therefore, it is expected that the public has a right to commercially exploit the patent without any restriction from the patentee after the patent expires. However, that objective wouldnt be achievable in case where a BIT hadTRIPS-plus provisions which could give a discretion to a state to extend the patent continuously and dominate the market as long as they expected. Consequently, such imbalance status of IP protection would be extended as a global standard because of MFN principles.
Thirdly, investment treaties could negatively effect to the public health among member countries. Right to access essential medicine is a part of human right of physical and mental health. However, due to TRIPS-plusinvestment treaties, a negative impact had been created against this human right. For instance, although there is a scarcity of essential medicine in Sub-Saharan Africa they are not contemplating upon the flexibility provided by TRIPS.This could be attributed to the political pressure and risk of economic sanctions.
In terms of public health, compulsory licensing system has become a vital component of IP especially in the case of LDCs and also in the developing world. Although TRIPS, has not provided specific limitations for issuing the compulsory licenses, BITs have created rigid limitations. For instance, in US-Vietnam BIT, compulsory licensing is limited to the emergency situations, antitrust remedies and public non-commercial use. This is not compatible with the Doha Declaration which has givenan absolute freedom to determine the grounds upon granting compulsory licences. For instance, in the UK, compulsory licences could be granted if the patentee had not exploited the patent within three years from the grant. In NatcoPharma Ltd Vs Bayer Corporation case, a compulsory licence has been granted by the patent controller to NatcoPharma to commercially exploit cancer cure in India. The ground for granting this licence was a refusal made by Bayer Corporation to issue a licence to Natco on their request.
Thus, if a developing country or a LDC become a party to a BIT with a developed country, then that country has to follow the conditions set by the BIT which would sometimes ultimately restrict the IP rights of the latter to keep the former ina dominant position. This has become a noteworthy issue especially when importing patented pharmaceutical products because BITs could sometimes unfairly prevent or control the access to essential medicine.In addition, certain long-term BITs could define highly restrictive conditions with respect to the compulsory licensing of drugs. Consequently, this would create an unfair monopoly and always keep the developed country in an unapprovable dominant position.
Generally, LDCstend to seek benefits by adopting at least the minimum standards of TRIPS while developing countries preferred to adopt it with slight modifications. For instance, in India, an innovation is patentable only if it is remarkably different in terms of properties with regard to efficacy. The rationale behind such provision is to increase the availability and accessibility of medicine to the large number of population. In the case of Novartis Vs Union of India case, court held that when designing the patent law, a special reference must be given to the economic condition of the country, scientific and technological advancement and its future needs. This approach is consistent with basic patentability standards laid down in TRIPS.
However, such flexibility could be diminished by the investment treaties if they seek to force implementation of higher economic standards preferred by developed countries to keep them in a dominant position. This situation could have been different only in case where the patent owned by a developing country which holds the upper hand. However, it could be rare because most of the developing countries in general need to adhere to the terms and conditions impose by the developed countries in order to have access to preferential market.
A desirable practice
Both less control and too much control over IP could cause problems. Therefore, a balance must be struck between the agreed parties in investment treaties. According to David Vaver, although balance is not a universal solvent it emphasizes the need for equal treatment and respect. This point must be considered when preparing investment treaties on IP. When considering the pharmaceutical industry, investment treaties should not impose high restrictions on compulsory licensing especially on Anti-Retroviral Drugs because such licences are an effective method which could open up the doors to those drugs without any hindrance. Investment Treaties should not restrict the Principle of Exhaustion, because this principle could assist developing countries to enjoy the benefits of parallel importing of IP especially in the realm of essential medicine. A sound example is the African RTAwhich has significantly improved parallel importing of drugs within the designated free trade zone.
To achieve a successful balance between intellectual property rights and public interest, investment treatiesshouldbe streamlined. For instance, desirable practices like MPI principles introduced by Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition (MPI) may be of assistance in this regard.According to these principles, parties to investment treaties should develop own proactive agenda and evaluate the impact of it against the public interest. This would be a significant strategy for the developing country like Sri Lanka to do an impact assessment about the long-term implications to the status of our national economy and the public health sector especially in terms of pharmaceutical industry. MPI principles insist that that the terms and conditions of an investment treaty should go through a public negotiation process and the agreement should be subjected to previous international obligations.
One of the main issues with respect to investment treaties was the effect to the public health because of higher limitations on compulsory licensing and restrictions on parallel imports. Such issues could be avoided by applying MPI principles because it guides to be consistent with the general principles laid down by TRIPS on Public Health. In addition, if a MFN exemption could be introduced in TRIPS, then itcould avoid the adverse effects of BITS over non-signatories of those treaties. Also, it would avoid spreading higher economic TRIPS-plus standards throughout the world. The TRIPS flexibilities such as parallel trade and compulsory licensing could be put forward by the RTAs between Sri Lanka and other developing countries to achieve a balance between public interest and the pharmaceutical patent holders.
The bottom-line
Despite the prospects of many advantages for both developed and developing world by being party to investment treaties on IP, one cannot overlook the disadvantages as well. The negative impact has reduced the value of flexibilities provided by TRIPS, and therefore has an adverse effect upon the developing countries and LDC s rather than developed countries. It is necessary to strike a balance between the right holder and the public interest as a solution to utilize investment treaties in a more effective manner. In this regard providing compulsory licences, parallel importing of IP and the principle of exhaustion are significant. Finally, MPI principles may be used as a sound set of guidelines which are likely to assist in striking a balance between intellectual property rights and the public interest.

India flagging concerns on  fishermens detention - Swaraj
New Delhi, Aug 3: External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Thursday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has consistently flagged Indias concerns over the detention of fishermen with the Government of Sri Lanka.
The fishermen matter was raised in each meeting of the Prime Minister Modi with Sri Lankan President and Prime Minister. Same has resulted in the release of 42 boats and 251 fishermen, Swaraj told members of the Rajya Sabha yesterday.
Communist Party of India leader and Rajya Sabha member of Tamil Nadu D. Raja questioned Swaraj as to what measures the government is taking to release Indian fishermen arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy.
He also asked the number of fishermen arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy.
Whether it is fact that Sri Lankan Navy continues to arrest Indian fishermen and they have lately arrested fishermen from Mandapam and confiscated their two trawlers on charges of engaging in bottom trawling. What is the number of fishermen and trawlers in their custody and what measures are being taken to get them released, he asked Swaraj.
Last month, at least seven Indian fishermen were reportedly arrested by the Sri Lanka Navy for trespassing Sri Lankan waters. The fishermen from Mandapam near Rameswaram were fishing at Neduntheevu Island in the Palk Straits, close to the island nations coast. (Outlook India)

Inflation to stabilise by end 2017 - CB Governor
Sri Lanka will have an economic growth rate of around 4.5% by the end of the year said Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy.
Speaking at the monetary policy review meeting yesterday, he said that one of the main reasons for this was the drought and several other weather-related issues, which resulted in the import of large quantities of rice and sugar.
In addition, the geo-economic policies in the Gulf and other countries also resulted in the reduction of foreign remittances.
He said that these may result in the increase of inflation, but it would settle down towards the end of the year and even fall lower early next year.
The Governor said that with the signing of the Hambantota Port deal, Sri Lankan foreign direct investments would receive a major boost, as there would be over US$ 400 million from it.
He also said that Sri Lankas Central Bank has purchased US$ 800 million from forex markets boosting forex reserves to US$ 6.7 billion by end July 2017.
Dr Coomaraswamy said that the pressure on the rupee too would settle down soon.
He said today Sri Lankas economic fundamentals are getting into place and even the Board of Investment has being restructured and the new board would be more focused.
Asked by the Daily News to comment on the request by the Chinese Ambassador, Yi Xianliang in Colombo for the direct use of Chinese currency RMB rather than the US dollar in its bilateral trade with Sri Lanka, he said the Central Bank has no objection. However Chinese businessmen prefer to deal with US dollars.
The Governor said that Chinas international business is growing and in five to six years time, Chinese currency would be very strong.

Limit on election campaign financing: PAFFREL, CMEV hand over draft Bill to Minister Mustapha
The Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) together with the Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) yesterday handed over a draft Bill aiming to limit election campaign spending to Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Mustapha.
PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi speaking to the Daily News said it was a result of discussions held within the Cabinet Sub-Committee appointed to look into the amendments to the Local Government Act.
We had wide consultations with the Elections Commission (EC), political parties and civil society organisations to draft the Bill, said Hettiarachchi who has also sent a draft to all Members of Parliament for consideration.
Minister Mustapha, he said had agreed to present the Bill to Cabinet and to Parliament for approval. The minister will discuss the Bill with the President and Prime Minister soon, he said.
One of the key changes the Bill has proposed is to have all candidates open a separate bank account when contesting an election and have all funds for a campaign directed to it.
Candidates have to audit the account and submit its accounts to the Elections Commission after the election. There should be a mechanism for the Elections Commission to monitor the accounts prior to that too," Hettiarachchi said.
PAFFREL and CMEV have proposed that the EC set a maximum limit a candidate can spend depending on the population of his/her electorate. They have suggested that Rs. 50 per voter be allowed for Local Government elections and Rs. 100 per voter for Parliamentary elections. Every five year period, the EC can review this limit," he said.
The Bill has proposed that limits be placed on the types of businesses that can donate to campaigns and to decree the maximum amount a donor can make to a campaign.
This is not an easy thing to do. Even if we do manage to make it law, it will be difficult to implement the law.
The Election Law states that candidates cannot distribute any form of gift among voters, but we know through experience that it happens anyway," the PAFFREL Executive Director said.
Hettiarachchi said the Bill was a positive step in the right direction.
Campaign finances have been a controversial issue for political parties with the Prime Minister stating that there needed to be a control and transparency in political financing. Increasing expenditure during elections also means that only the rich or those who are able to raise large amounts can contest for public office, he said.
A Local Government member would earn a maximum of Rs. 500,000 for his full term, but he would spend around Rs 1-10 million to get elected. It is not surprising that there is corruption," Hettiarachchi said.
PAFFREL and CMEV are determined that a Bill on campaign finances be passed and said that if Minister Mustapha failed to present it to Parliament, they could lobby the MPs to present it as a private member Bill.
We have 26 MPs who have pledged to stand for clean politics, so hopefully, one of them will do this. This is not a perfect Bill, but it is a good start," Hettiarachchi said.

CEO Award for Excellence and CEO Award for Commitment to Responsible Business
The London Stock Exchange Group  Sri Lanka (LSEG SL) was feted with two prestigious awards at the recently concluded Annual LSEG CEO Awards, taking top honours in the categories for Responsible Business, and Excellence.
A cross functional team from LSEG Sri Lanka won the CEO Award for Excellence for their exceptional contribution to generate high volume, speed, and quality to support the opening of LSEGs new technology facility in Sri Lanka.
LSEG opened its new state-of-the-art technology facility in December 2016. Headquartered at Trace Expert City in Colombo, the new technology hub was opened by the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and LSEG Chairman, Donald Brydon. Through this new facility, LSEG will directly employ 400 personnel in high-technology jobs, with an additional 1200 employed indirectly to provide technical support services for the Group's global network.
Winning the CEO Award for Commitment to Responsible Business was MillenniumITs team Mahoga for their launch of Mahoga: the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) platform.
Winner of the CEO Award for Excellence  Team Mahoga: Jayaruwan Mannapperuma, Isuru Herath, Dewmal Anicitus, Kishan Navaratne, Chris Corrado, Ishan De Silva, Shanaka Abeywickrama, Rukshan Abeyratne, Ramila Hettiarachchi (Absent in the picture: Dinu Kumarasiri, Supun Vithana, Thusara Jayasinghe)
The project was recognised for its potential to be a major force in driving charitable involvement and fundraising, embodying the Groups corporate responsibility objectives.
Mahoga is a web platform designed to match a social investor with a beneficiary that is in need of resources and support. With a reputation for powering over 40 stock exchanges and trading venues across the world, the team took up the challenge to create a platform that could match donors with beneficiaries to achieve a long-term, sustainable impact. Through Mahoga, the LSEG SL CSR team intends to bridge the existing gaps in the corporate responsibility domain and facilitate the allocation of resources in the best way possible to drive transformative CSR projects.
This year, over 150 nominations were accepted across seven categories. They were then reviewed by a cross-business, cross-regional judging panel chaired by the Group heads of Human Resources and Communications. Judges were then selected from across LSEG's Leadership Team to ensure representation across businesses and geographies.
LSEG believes the annual CEO Awards play an important role in recognising and rewarding employees at all levels of the organisation. This year multiple category awards have been won by teams, indicating a strong culture of collaboration which has contributed to the Groups success and helped fuel growth.

National protest day a success: GMOA
The national protest day was conducted on Wednesday with the collective effort of trade unions in the country, Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) General Secretary Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing the media at the GMOA Headquarters yesterday, he said the national protest day was conducted to request the government again to abolish the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM). Aluthge said a trade union action would be conducted islandwide if a favourable response would be received from the government within a week in relation to the request to abolish SAITM.
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Politburo Member Lal Kantha said the governments aim would be to convert the medical degree into a commodity.
Lal Kantha said it would be a threat to free education and to the middle and lower class people in the country. He said they would battle against SAITM until it would be abolished. Medical Faculty Students Action Committee Convener Rayan Jayalath said, SAITM is an organisation which contributes for corruption.
It can never be standardised to provide quality medical education, he said. Ceylon Teachers Services Union General Secretary Mahinda Jayasinghe and Inter-University Students Federation (IUSF) Acting Convener Sanath Bandara also participated.

NCE dismayed over moves to remove cess on imports
The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) the premier private sector Chamber which exclusively serves and represents Sri Lankan Exporters, has expressed dismay by apparent moves of Government Authorities to remove Cess on imported products hitherto imposed as a protective measure for local enterprises.
The Chamber which has over 600 Export Oriented Enterprises in its membership across all product sectors and many services, which are represented by over 40 Sectoral Heads in its Council, has engaged their serious concerns, since it is understood that moves are afoot remove Cess on imported products, as a part of policy reforms related to free trade.
The Chamber is concerned that in spite of assurances given at various times by the Prime Minister and the relevant subject Ministers, that the private sector will be consulted before making any significant policy changes, the purported move to remove Cess across the board on imported products, will have severe adverse consequences on local enterprises in many sectors, which need a certain amount of protection for their sustainability and growth. In the above context the Chamber is strongly of the view that an opportunity should be provided for the various Sectorial Heads to assess the implications of such a move on local enterprises in their particular sectors, and make suggestions regarding remedial measures before any action is taken to remove the Cess on imported products, which have a direct consequence on local products.
It is understood there is a similar suggestion to remove the Export Cess imposed currently on exports of certain basic raw materials, which encourages value addition domestically.
The Chamber proposes to conduct a Brainstorming Forum in the near future with representatives of the relevant product sectors to discuss this issue, with a view to propose remedial measures, and urges the concerned State Authorities to defer any moves to remove the existing Cess on imported products, as well as the Export Cess imposed on the export of certain raw materials without proper consultations with the private sector.

New  amendment to mixed  electoral system
The newly introduced mixed electoral system for the Local Government bodies will undergo another Amendment shortly to make the First-Past-the-Post (FPP) representation 60 percent and Proportional Representation(PR) 40 percent.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha said the Government would present an Amendment Bill to the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to this effect in Parliament next week.
The minor parties were insisting to increase the allocation for proportional representation. Accordingly, the Government has now decided to bring down the FPP representation from 70 to 60 percent and increase the proportional representation from 30 to 40 percent, the minister said.
The minister said the total number of LG councilors would be 8,542 as per the new Amendment. Out of that 1,400 would be female councilors. The number of candidates elected from the FPP will be 5,092. The Minister further said an amendment bill to provide for holding elections for all Provincial Councils on a single day would also be presented to Parliament shortly. The Amendment received Cabinet approval. The practice of holding Provincial Council elections separately paves the way for misuse of public property and abuse of ruling power, thus distorting the peoples mandate. The Election watchdog bodies are also in agreement with this position. This is not an attempt to delay the elections, he insisted. He said as per the draft amendment, a specific date would be fixed for holding the elections for all Provincial Councils.
This date has to be decided collectively by Parliament. The resolution in this regard will be presented either by the Leader of the House or me on behalf of the Government, he said.
The minister, observing that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has already received a large number of applications to contest for the upcoming LG elections, said the party would give priority to educated and intelligent individuals with clean hands.
The new hybrid system sans preferential votes would help community leaders and individuals with clean hands to come to the fore. The peoples mandate was not properly reflected in the preferential vote system. Only the affluent could afford to enter the election fray. A change in electoral system is a timely need of the country, Musthapha opined.
We need new faces in our political landscape. The SLFP accepts this challenge. Teachers, engineers, doctors and community leaders are among those who have sent us applications for LG nominations, the minister said. The minister said increasing the quota for women is a progressive move by the Government, adding that the studies have revealed that corruption is lower and efficiency is high in administrative bodies where women are in.

Our critics have  no credentials
New Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe has been compelled to face a tough state of affairs with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Trade Union actions instigated by the Hambantota Port Agreement. All the same, the senior minister assures that the agreement with China will not compromise the countrys economic independence and sovereignty.
The original agreement, Minister Samarasinghe emphasises, has already been amended to safeguard the countrys interests. The clauses were added to enable variation of the agreement with reference to future requirements and exigencies both foreign and domestic.
Q: Several Trade Unions of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) launched a strike against the leasing out of the Hambantota Port Tank complex and Trincomalee Petroleum Tank complex to China and India. Yet, the unperturbed government gave the green light. Will this action not lead to any aggravation of the situation
A: Initially, as a former Labour Minister, I must say that I have a high respect for Trade Unions. Throughout my public life, I have encouraged open and frank dialogue with them. They have an interesting and valuable perspective on matters of public policy and governance. When I took office as Ports and Shipping Minister in May, I took special efforts to ensure that our dialogue with the Unions was a candid, healthy and mutually respectful one.
That said it is the Governments ultimate responsibility to ensure economic security and development. Sometimes, we have to decide what the best available option is to strengthen the economy and cater to the welfare of the people as a whole. Mind you, sometimes these are inescapable options that are the legacy of the previous era. We have to address and redress the shortcomings of yesteryear and look ahead to ensure the rights and aspirations of future generations of the Sri Lankans. That is the onerous duty cast on any responsible government. We cannot step down from that responsibility in the face of the trades unions or any other group. It is our duty to take decisions, sometimes tough ones, and make a call based on current needs and priorities.
We took a long close look at the draft concession agreement based on the framework agreement concluded last year. It went through several iterations since the beginning of the decade. We consulted stakeholders and our chosen foreign partner and we worked out the best possible solution available at the present juncture. Moreover, we kept the Cabinet of Ministers, the sovereign legislature, and the public informed of the new clauses introduced to protect Sri Lankas national interests. Just last Tuesday I enlightened the public by way of a media conference of the salient features of the agreement. I think this level of transparency is very rare, if not unprecedented, in modern Sri Lankan history when it comes to an agreement of this nature.
Q: Other services have also warned that they will join the CPC workers if a favourable solution would not be offered by the government. Any precaution to attend to this matter
A: President Maithripala Sirisena has given us a clear mandate. His principle and overriding concern is not to compromise Sri Lankas economic independence and sovereignty. In line with the Presidents thinking, we have done our utmost to safeguard the national interest and to make this vast investment a going and a viable concern of direct benefit to the people of this country. I outlined the numbers involved last Tuesday.
It is relatively easy to criticise some governmental action or another. However the pre-existing alternatives are unthinkable. The situation was rapidly becoming unsustainable. As it stood, the financial viability of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority was challenged by the huge debt burden. Now we will see a turnaround in the short space of time and the realisation of the vast potential of Hambantota in particular.
At this moment I think this is the most favourable solution that can be devised. I do not think that a debt repayment of Rs. 9.1 billion annually and a consolidated loss of Rs. 46.7 billion from 2011 to 2016 is a very favourable scenario to maintain. If the trade unions want to see the most favourable outcome, they should study the entire picture.
Q: The Opposition claims that the Government is selling out the strategically important state assets to foreign counterparts to salvage a badly managed economy. What is your response to this
A: That is laughable. At no time did we ever agree to sell one square centimeter of territory. Indeed we have reduced the extent of land to be governed by the agreement. Those who spread these canards for their own narrow political ends are doing a great disservice to the country. The Sri Lankan people are well aware of who planned to alienate sovereign territory and what a long-term commercial lease is, by comparison. I have explained in detail the extent of the rights and obligations arising out of the agreement. Nowhere does it contemplate sale of any assets  movable or immovable. Even the operational assets will be owned by two Sri Lankan companies and will be subject to Sri Lankan law.
Q: President agreed to accommodate the demands of the Trade Union Collective by way of amendments to the Hambantota Port Agreement. Will there be amendments to the agreement
A: As I said, there could be variations to the agreement signed by the principal parties at any point in the future. If and when any such amendment is deemed necessary, proper negotiations must be conducted with a formal consensus reached.
That is how international commercial relations work. If we, as a small island nation, wish to take full advantage of the economic and other benefits of such partnerships with international players, we have to guarantee certainty and sanctity of contractual obligations. Investors and partners look for stability as a precondition for entering a market.
We have prior experience of such arrangements being disrupted due to short-term political needs. We cannot go down that road any more if we are to be taken seriously as an investment destination and be considered a viable international partner.
Our approach must be serious, well-informed and professional. It applies to all future governments of this country.
Q: It was reported a few months back that the Government has already scaled down the Hambantota Agreement in the face of trade union protests
A: We consulted as many stakeholders as we could. We modified the agreement in consultation with the foreign partner. I dont think any pressure group, political formation, trade union or any other party had influence on this process. We have a vision and want to see that vision brought to fruition.
However, we are also a responsive administration in keeping with the tenets of good governance. We listened and accommodated whatever we could without compromising the letter and spirit of the overall consensus. It is no secret what we have done.
The national legislature  consisted of the elected representatives of the Sri Lankan people - is fully aware of what the scope and content of the agreement entails.
Q: You have been made to face a tough situation as the new Ports and Shipping Minister.
A: I welcome the challenge. As long as we are guided by the President and Prime Minister and their clear and positive vision for the future, I am certain that we in the administration can deliver what was promised.
After all, what we are doing today will only amount to the benefit of future Sri Lankans who dream of a safer, more secure and more prosperous future. I am happy to face any difficulty and work towards making a worthwhile contribution to ensure that dream comes true.

Perils of forgotten contract
Representative government is a type of social contract in which the elected representatives enter into a contract with the people to carry out agreed reforms to benefit the people. Hence, its existence could be justified only to the extent it honours the contract. Sri Lankan experience, however, is that once elected the representatives of the people forget the contract and begin to act on their own and carry out programmes more on consideration of electoral benefits more than peoples interests.
On matters of economic management they tend to heed more the voice of international financial institutions such as the IMF, World Bank and the WTO more than the voice of the people. For example, the Government that came to power in 1977, which promised to provide 8 Kg of grain to every person, cut the rice subsidy and increased prices across the board, removed most subsidies for the poor. Its programme of divesting state owned enterprises in the private sector was considered as too hasty even by World Bank experts. SLFP led governments since 1995 embraced and perpetuated the executive presidency that they promised to abolish on coming to power.
Some countries have provision in their Constitutions to recall elected MPs and Presidents midway in their term of office. It would be advisable to include such a provision in drafting the new Constitution by the present Constitutional Assembly. Even if not recalled governments have a tendency to subvert or rig the electoral process or use violence as well as large-scale corrupt practices such as bribery and impersonation of voters.
National reconciliation
The performance of the Yahapalana Government seems to be not much different from that of its predecessors as far as honouring the social contract entered on January 8, 2015, despite certain positive outcomes. Exigencies of maintaining power or other interests have compelled it to take momentarily popular or advantageous decisions compromising its own long term benefits. For example it has displayed a tendency to compromise on certain issues affecting its own policy of promoting national reconciliation by taking a defensive position when communal forces began an offensive against it. The hesitation to act promptly when certain interested groups launched a wave of attacks against Muslim establishments and certain Christian religious establishments is an example.
Contrary to the promise to formulate national policies on major issues or aspects of government policies the government has failed to work out a single national policy for the last two and half years. Instead ad hoc reforms are being contemplated implemented piecemeal.
Lack of strategic planning and a holistic approach to development has resulted in certain expensive development projects causing unforeseen damages as happened in the case of the Uma Oya project. Neglecting expert advice in proceeding with the Nilwala Ganga Scheme and halfway-stopping of the same caused untold damage in Matara district during recent floods. Patch-work repairs being implemented even now have the potential of causing still greater damage, as residents point out.
SAITM issue
The adverse effects of the present drought could have been avoided had enough disaster preparedness was in place. The necessity of maintaining adequate buffer stocks of rice for such a contingency could have been foreseen. A more rational and less wasteful use of electricity could have reduced the need for power-cuts.
Nowhere does the impudence and foolishness of the rulers is seen than in the case of SAITM issue. Lack of transparency and political procrastination and intransigence shown in settling the issue has led to a stalemate. The government seems to be oblivious to the fate of nearly 7,000 Medical undergraduates as it refuses to deal with them by any means other than repression.
The effect of their street action on their education and its repercussions on the state healthcare services and professional development of existing cadre is forgotten even by the Minister in charge of health who with the Education Minister and few others seems to teach the students a lesson by confining them to the streets.
The fact that the former President and his opportunist band of the JO is supporting the agitation by the GMOA and Medical students need not make them blind to the issues raised by them. It would be foolish to conclude that the entire student body or the fraternity of doctors is inspired by the former President. In doing so they are pushing a large mass of voters into the lap of the former President or other opponents of the regime. Any government with a modicum of intelligence would try by civilized means to win them and keep the majority of them as its supporters.
Striking petroleum workers
As stated in this column earlier Government keep on repeating that there is too much democracy. Recent talks about devising means of preventing street protests on the pretext of inconveniencing the public could then be an attempt to curb democratic space opened up in January 8. Taken in conjunction with the sadistic attack on striking petroleum workers it is apparent that the Yahapalana government has taken a leaf from the handbook of the former autocratic regime.
The manner in which government spokesmen try to re-define the role of trade unions and other civic organisations confining them to economic issues only shows that they are not even willing to recognize their rights to freedom of expression and association recognized by bourgeois liberal democracy while claiming to profess social democracy.
It is also regrettable that the government has taken a hundred and eighty turn with respect to fighting bribery and corruption. The exposures at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on the Central Bank Bond issue points to distinct attempts by leading figures in the present government to cover up the scam.
While these politicians enjoy the privileges of government and the security provided by state law enforcement agencies they could only ignore at their own peril the fact their Judgement Day would inevitably come in 2020, if not earlier.

Political parties should  reveal their stand  on election  postponement: CaFFE
The Campaign for Free and Fair Election (CaFFE) yesterday said that all political parties should divulge their stand on the postponement of elections by the government.
According to (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon, the Incumbent President can hold the office until December 9, 2019.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said the Presidential Election is the only election in the country that cannot be postponed.
Nominations should be called for the next Presidential Election on December 9, 2019 according the law. He said the government is trying to postpone all elections until October 8, 2019, the day, the term of Uva Provincial Council ends, Tennakoon said.
People's Action For Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said the previous government took an advantage by holding elections part by part. The present government is postponing elections with a well formulated plan.
The Elections Commission said democracy is being heisted. Holding the Local Government election is in the hands of the Political party Leaders, he said.
Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) National Coordinator Manjula Gajanayake said the postponement of elections is one of the main signs of the destruction of democracy. The government said it postponed the Provincial Council elections to hold them within one day. It takes two days to pass the amended Act in Parliament, he said.
National Coordinator of the National Polls Observation Centre (NPOC) Rasanga Harischandra said when a government folded the elections map, the country became a pool of blood. Local Government elections of over 60 LG bodies can be held without any issue. The Prime Minister presented a Cabinet paper to postpone the PC Elections.
Shashi de Mel from Transparency International Sri Lanka said her organisation is disappointed over the postponement of PC elections by the government stating that it needs to allocate a quota for women candidates.
Public engagement is essential for such a move. If the government had a sincere wish to increase women's representation, it could have been started the process just after January 8, 2015.
Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Alternative (CPA) Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu said elections should be held as scheduled.
The people should have the right to select their representatives through elections. The country had bad experiences when elections were postponed, he said.

Pollution threatens Chithramala Ella
Chithramala Ella also known as Hakurudola Ella or Wavul Ella situated near Marukanda close to Nedurana along Eheliyagoda - Idangoda Road is threatened by pollution.
Illicit gem mining along the upper stream and paddy fields of both sides of the stream pollutes water becoming a serious environmental problem.
This immaculate white cascading waterfall not only provides drinking water for a large number of people but also supplies water for hundreds of acres of paddy fields. It generates 350 kilo watts of electricity which feeds into the main power lines.
Chitramala Ella derives its name from a clever artist who drew frescoes on the walls of a vihara and drowned while bathing. As the scenery is breath-taking, this area can be developed as a tourist attraction, nature lovers said.

Programme to dig wells in Anuradhapura
The Divisional Secretaries in the Anuradhapura district were instructed to dig common wells in tank beds, reservation lands and other suitable locations where underground water could be available.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that this programme is being implemented according to the directives given by President Maithripala Sirisena during his recent visit to Kebithigollewa to gather first-hand information about drought-hit farmer families.
The Government Agent said under the first phase, 50 wells would be dug and the first 15 wells would be in Padaviya and Kebithigollewa DS Divisions.
It is observed that the underground water level in many jurisdictions had been decreasing. The water supply of the community based rural water supply schemes are also disrupted due to the prevailing drought.
We are now planning to distribute water through bowsers. However, we face difficulties in finding suitable water sources close to affected areas.
At present, around 60,000 people in 12 DS division in the district are being provided with drinking water through bowsers, the Government Agent said.

Ranil Wickremesinghe: Revolutionary architect of  modern Sri Lanka
On his State tour to Australia in February this year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was honoured by Deakin University with an honourary doctorate at the graduation ceremony held on the Geelong Waterfront Campus.
Although honoured with a doctorate, Premier instructed his staff never to use the tag Dr before his name. That shows the man and his character. It firmly affirms that he is a No Show Man.
In his address at the graduation ceremony, he told the crowd of Deakin alumni and their families to be persistent in the current climate of technological change.
Start as a follower. Always be humble and learn from the others, especially from the mistakes. Be prepared to lose. In life, you face both success and disaster. Learn to face these setbacks.
According to the Deakin spokesperson, Premier Wickremesinghe was honoured for modernising laws and legal institutions to drive foreign investment in Sri Lanka.
One of the most seasoned politicians in Sri Lanka today, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe holds the office for the fourth time. He is hailed as the pioneering figure of modern Sri Lanka with a new political culture.
He took the courageous decision to work with President Maithripala Sirisena. He had sincere desire to resolve many issues. By doing so, he had set an example by encouraging the countries that face similar situations.
The world leaders have expressed their appreciation for showing positive signs in resolving the issues, which the world might term as impossible by taking the other option against all odds and working out methodically and intelligently putting the country before the self or preference for the country in other words.
In fact, the United Nations has praised Sri Lanka's new government for speeding up efforts towards reconciliation with the ethnic minority, Tamils.
Samantha Power, the US Permanent Representative to the United Nations who visited Sri Lanka in November last year, said that the UN recognized the commitment of the Sri Lanka Government shown for reconciliation with the steps taken towards returning the land to rightful owners, efforts making to find people gone missing, in terms of Prevention of Terrorism, and implementation of accountability.
While the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) leader Maithripala Sirisena gives leadership in running the affairs of the country, UNF Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, as promised at the election rallies to form an All Party Government, joined the President without any hesitation and formed the Good Governance Government now in operation. This he did although he could have easily formed a pure UNF Government with the help of a few other MPs.
Presidential Election
Ranil Wickremesinghe is a gentleman in the true sense of the word. He willingly sacrificed positions that could have been his own. He gave way to Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to run for the 2010 Presidential Election and to the former Health Minister of the UPFA Government Maithripala Sirisena who came forward to the 2015 Presidential Election. This was his positive response to the advice he received from the Maha Sangha. He was not selfish.
Although he was castigated by his rivals with that mud-slinging slogan Ranil is incapable, he did not go to that low level to attack his opponents by casting aspersion or to shout back, at them. He did not fall into that low level. His unruffled behaviour, being, very calm and quiet, and the way he acts, manifested well his maturity and also very much proved the saying that people aim and hit the tree bearing fruits.
He had shown the signs of a good leader. He had the patience to bear in silence all that said to provoke him.
Reading through the events that had gone by, he underscored the importance of running an all-party Government. That was why he told the constituents at each political rally that he needs to form an all-party Government.
Giving his first interview to The Hindu newspaper immediately after assuming Premiership, Wickremesinghe said: We have tremendous issues to resolve, more than our personal political rivalries. We will first have to get the country moving -- that's the priority.
Actions taken by the Government in resolving issues prove that what was said in the interview were not mere words but words brimming with motivation and action.
The United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party are the two major political parties come together to form the government of Good Governance, although the duo fought from the rival camps to gain the power to govern the country.
With the final results of the 2015 General Election were out, paving the way for the UNF to form the next government, UNF Leader Wickremesinghe moved by the genuine desire to resolve the divergent issues pestering the country for decades invited non-member political parties of the UNF, to put away all differences and join the Government for the sake of the country.
The signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two major political parties in the country took the world by surprise and today the concept of Good Governance is moving as a reality, towards achieving the goals the parties in the UNITY GOVERNMENT agreed upon to achieve.
Good Governance Government
The rival parties, opposed to this unity government, are hell-bound to break the unity. They want to create chaos in the country. They try all their tricks to create fractions within the rank and file of the Unity Government, knowing well that their future is doomed, if the Good Governance Government were to continue. They fear that their evil hopes and aspirations would be shattered and the end results would be most critical, unpredictable and unimaginable. So they keep on trying.
Ranil Wickremesinghe served the country as Prime Minister from 1993 to 1994 being appointed to succeed Prime Minister D B Wijetunga who assumed duties as the Executive President of Sri Lanka after the assassination of Ranasinghe Premadasa on May 1, 1993.
Winning the General Election held in the year 2001, as the UNP leader, he formed the United National Front Government and served the country as the Prime Minister for the second time, from 2001 to 2004. The country was governed by President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
With the successful conclusion of the Presidential Election on January 8, 2015, the Opposition Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena was elected as the Executive President of this country with the UNP backing. Immediately after taking his oath, before the Chief Justice K Sri Pavan, the UNF Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in as Prime Minister for the Third Time, being appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena.
During his interview with NDTV, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that the Unity Government was in agreement in principle to abolish the Executive Presidency and to fully implement the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lanka Constitution, to resolve the ethnic issue which had eaten into the very fabric of society.
Born on March 24, 1949, just one year after Sri Lanka gained independence from the British Empire, Wickremesinghe, is truly a leader of the new independent era. He, a lawyer by profession, was elected at the age of 28, to the Sri Lanka Parliament at the year 1977 General Election, as the UNP Member for Biyagama Electorate, in the Gampaha District of the Western Province.

Romance on the Tennis Court
Remembering some of the most cherished moments of world history when wedding bells tolled and two people united in love in magical surroundings
They first met as opponents in a mixed doubles tennis tournament in August 1957. For more than two years, a small army of newsmen had watched the bachelor prince like hawks, taking careful note of his feminine tennis partners, who were usually members of noble families and consequently suitable prospective brides. But they paid scant attention to the girl on the other side of the net on that fateful day in August  she was not an  and missed witnessing the first petals of love opening under the summer skies.
On that August afternoon, Michiko Shoda (the daughter of a businessman who owned a flour-milling company) and Bobby Doyle, her American tennis partner, eliminated their mixed doubles opponents  Crown Prince Akihito and his partner. It took more than two hours for the Shoda-Doyle team to win. The game over, the four went to the benches.
It was a long match, wasnt it  said Akihito, speaking for the first time to Michiko. But the only indication that he took more than a passing interest in the girl was the fact that he opened his camera and snapped a picture of her.
Some months later, Akihito had the photograph enlarged and framed, and secretly presented it to Michiko through a friend. He also invited her to a private tennis match arranged for the brother of the shah of Iran, who was then visiting Tokyo.
Wisely, Michiko breathed not a word of the princes interest to anyone but her parents and to Mother Elizabeth Britt, president of Sacred Heart university in Tokyo, where Michi, an English literature major, was at the top of her class.
Both her parents were strongly opposed to her engagement, and she herself declined the honor of being Prince Akihitos wife, more than once. The main reason was that members of the imperial family lead cloistered, artificial lives. But the Prince refused to give up, and love triumphed in the end. The wedding was set for April 1959.
From time immemorial, the Emperor has been considered by his subjects to be the Son of Heaven. He and his family, according to belief, dwell above the clouds. Many previous emperors had, chosen commoners as their concubines, but the engagement of Prince Akihito and Michiko Shoda marked the first time in Japans 26 centuries of history that an heir to the throne had  descended from the clouds  in search of a bride. And when Akihito fell in love with Michiko, another precedent was broken. For the first time, a royal heir had become engaged as the result of romance rather than of a per-arranged court decision.
Of course, what went on between Akihito and Michiko can hardly be called a romance, by western standards. Until their engagement was officially announced by the imperial household, the two were never alone together. They did not hold hands or exchange confidences. It was purely through furtive glances that they were able to communicate their feelings to each other. They did talk over the telephone, but usually with somebody else listening in.
As time went by, the young couple had gained wide public support. That support also came from the ruling political class. Additionally, everyone showed affection for the young Mitchi who had become the symbol of Japans modernization and democratization (the media at the time hinted at the phenomenon of a Mitchi boom).
The wedding that broke with tradition  Prince Akihitos bride of choice was the first commoner to marry into the Japanese Imperial Family, finally took place at a traditional Shinto ceremony on 10 April 1959. The wedding procession was followed in the streets of Tokyo by more than 500,000 people spread over a 8.8km route, while parts of the wedding were televised, thus making it the first imperial wedding to be made available for public viewer ship in Japan, drawing about 15 million viewers. In accordance with tradition, Michiko received a personal emblem: the white birch of Japan upon admission to the imperial family.
Dr. Shinzo Koizumi, who supervised the Crown Princes education for many years, said of this marriage: The Crown Prince chose her, and so did we.

Rupee hits over 2-year high after  RBI cuts repo rate
The Indian rupee strengthened to its highest in more than two years amid heavy selling of dollars by foreign banks, with the central bank decision to cut interest rates having only a limited impact, according to traders.
Indian rupee surged to a two-year high of 63.60 against the dollar before closing at 63.70. The dollar had briefly touched a 15-month low against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday, though it bounced modestly on Wednesday.
The move in the rupee was magnified as the Reserve Bank of India refrained from intervening to cap broader gains in the domestic currency, traders said, adding they were unsure why the central bank had stayed away.
The RBI typically intervenes through state-run banks by buying or selling dollars whenever the rupee moves sharply either way.
"Today, the lack of buying dollars by RBI has made the rupee fly off," said Sajal Gupta, head of forex and rates at Edelweiss Securities.
The rupee rose to as much as 63.59 per dollar, its strongest level since July 22, 2015, from its close of 64.0750 on Tuesday. It ended trade at 63.69.
Traders said the RBI decision on Wednesday to cut the repo rate had only a limited impact, given the decision had been widely expected. The central bank said any future action would depend on economic data.
The benchmark 10-year bond yield rose 2 basis points to 6.46 percent, with some traders saying they were disappointed by the RBI's cautious tone.
"The document lacked any guidance. There is no indication of future rate cuts," said a dealer at a foreign bank.
In share markets, the broader NSE index closed down 0.33 percent, while the benchmark BSE index ended 0.30 percent lower. (Business Today)

Russia blasts  US sanctions as  economic war
RUSSIA: Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev lashed new US sanctions as a full-fledged economic war on Moscow, saying they crushed hopes for repairing ties and demonstrated President Donald Trumps total weakness ... in the most humiliating way. Trump reluctantly signed off on the new sanctions Wednesday, bowing to domestic pressure after the White House failed to scupper the bill or water it down.
Medvedev warned the move would have consequences, saying it ends hopes for improving our relations with the new US administration. Second, it is a declaration of a full-fledged economic war on Russia, Medvedev said on his Facebook page.
Taunting the notoriously thin-skinned US president, Medvedev added: The Trump administration has shown its total weakness by handing over executive power to Congress in the most humiliating way.
Trump signed the legislation behind closed doors and his reluctance was on full display in an angry signing statement in which he called the legislation significantly flawed. In its haste to pass this legislation, the Congress included a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions, he said, including curbs on the presidents ability to negotiate with Russia.
I built a truly great company worth many billions of dollars. That is a big part of the reason I was elected. As president, I can make far better deals with foreign countries than Congress, Trump claimed.
The legislation -- which also includes measures against North Korea and Iran -- targets the Russian energy sector, giving Washington the ability to impose sanctions on companies involved in developing Russian pipelines, and placing curbs on some Russian weapons exporters.
Iran, too, reacted angrily, saying the new sanctions against it violated its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, and warned it would respond appropriately. With regards to Russia, the sanctions notably constrains Trumps ability to waive the penalties -- a statement of mistrust from the Republican-controlled Congress, which remains unsettled by Trumps warm words for President Vladimir Putin.
In his statement, Trump said: The Framers of our Contitution put foreign affairs in the hands of the President. This bill will prove the wisdom of that choice. In a searing rebuttal, maverick Republican Senator John McCain said: The framers of our constitution made the Congress and the President coequal branches of government. This bill has already proven the wisdom of that choice. I hope the president will be as vocal about Russias aggressive behaviour as he was about his concerns with this legislation.
The sanctions seek to penalise the Kremlin for allegedly meddling in the 2016 US presidential election and for Russias annexation of Crimea.
Trump said he would honour some of the bills provisions, but stopped short of saying it would be fully implemented.
The White House said only that Trump would give Congresss preferences mere careful and respectful consideration. I am signing this bill for the sake of national unity. It represents the will of the American people to see Russia take steps to improve relations with the United States, Trump said.
Trump had received the legislation at 1:53 pm on Friday, but waited until Wednesday to sign it.
The delay had raised speculation that Trump might veto or try to somehow shelve the sanctions, which were approved in a 98-2 Senate vote.

Sara Netanyahu grilled  in fraud probe
Israeli police grilled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's wife for two hours on Wednesday on suspicion that she diverted public money for private housekeeping expenses, local media said.
The interrogation came as a new threat loomed over the premier in his own long-running battle with corruption suspicions, as his former chief of staff reportedly considered an offer to turn state's evidence.
Israeli public radio said Sara Netanyahu was interrogated at National Fraud Squad headquarters near Tel Aviv over allegations she used public money for personal housekeeping expenses at the couple's official and private residences. As during previous rounds of questioning of both the premier and his wife, police issued no statement on Sara Netanyahu's questioning. But it was her husband's tribulations that grabbed the front pages of all of Israel's major dailies -- including the pro-Netanyahu freesheet Israel Hayom on Wednesday. They reported that justice officials were nearing a deal with his former chief of staff, Ari Harow, in which he would give evidence against his former boss in exchange for immunity from prosecution for his own acts. - AFP

Sniff the Scents and Smells..!
Every morning after a brisk walk and a jog, I come home and take my dog for his stroll. We saunter down to a field and I allow him to sniff the different scents and smells while I sit on stone and wait. Today I suddenly allowed myself to sniff the scents and smells too. I smelt the trees, the ground and then I looked for the first time at plants breaking into the world, trees with new fruit and heard the sound of birds welcoming a new morning.
There was such sense of peace.
These sounds and smells and sights were there everyday, it was just that I had not taken them in. had never enjoyed the moment.
An Italian journalist, Renato Giuntini, once visited the great pianist Arthur Rubinstein. When leaving, the musician gave the journalist a box of his favourite cigars.Ill keep them all my life, said the newspaperman.
Dont, replied Rubinstein. You must smoke them my friend. These cigars are as exquisite as life. You dont conserve life. You enjoy it to the full. Theres no joy without loving and enjoying the moment!
Arthur Toscanini, the Italian conductor was celebrating his 80th birthday when a friend at the party asked his son, Walter, what his father considered as his most important achievement.
Walter replied, For him there can be no such thing. Whatever he happens to be doing at the moment is the biggest thing in his life  whether it is conducting a symphony or peeling an orange!
And heres one for parents.
The neighbours always buy their children solid unbreakable toys, said a woman to her friend, so when I went for my Christmas shopping I was wondering whether I should do the same.
But my husband had other ideas; he wanted toys that our children could play with and even break. Theyll love them, he said. So we gave our children breakable toys.
And to tell you the truth, the woman concluded, I havent seen happier children!
Luigi Tarisio was found dead one morning with nothing of comfort in his home except 246 violins which he had been collecting all his life. They were crammed in an attic. The best of the lot were found in the bottom drawer of an old rickety cupboard.He deprived the world of all that music those instruments could have produced while he hoarded and treasured them in his cupboard!
What do you and I do with precious moments
Do we hoard them out of sight, keep them carefully like unbreakable toys or enjoy the moment by smelling the trees, enjoying the rustling wind, watching a child at play
Do we watch a romping dog, exchange smiles with friends
Enjoy the moment, sniff the scents and smells..!

SriLankan on-time in 2017

SriLankan Airlines has recorded a consistently superior on-time performance during the first six months of this year, in comparison with its peers.
The latest statistics by the global flight data tracker Flightstats.com ranks Sri Lankas national carrier as the fifth most punctual among 40 of the worlds leading airlines.
SriLankan Airlines CEO Captain Suren Ratwatte said: We are delighted with the performance of every member of our team at SriLankan, who has raised the bar of professionalism to an extraordinary level in order to achieve such a consistent and long-term success. I feel certain that our passengers, who benefit most from this effort, would be absolutely delighted, as they know that they can count on SriLankan to be on-time, all the time.
SriLankans flights were on-time 86.49% ahead of the time, far ahead of the average 78.33% achieved by the 40 airlines Flightstats monitors.
These include many of the finest carriers in the Middle East, Europe, Far East, Australia, North America, South America and South Asia.
SriLankans consistent performance over the entire first half of 2017 resulted in it being ranked in the top ten of these airlines for four of the last six months, with on-time ratings of 81.52% in January, 85.88% in February, 83.67% in March, 85.21% in April, and 85.36% in May.
The high on-time performance is particularly impressive when taking into account the congestion and stresses that arose during the runway re-surfacing at Colombos Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), which is SriLankans home base, during January to April 2017.
SriLankans Ground Handling (GH) division, which has a policy of never compromising on the safety, security and global award-winning service levels to its passengers, is the sole provider of ground handling services in Colombo.
Its performance has led to consistently favourable comments from its airline customers as well as passengers.
SriLankan GH handled approximately 9.5 million passengers on over 57,000 flights of all airlines at BIA during the financial year 2016/17.
SriLankans on-time performance is monitored by a Punctuality Improvement Committee that oversees the performance of its airport passenger service staff, cargo handlers, pilots, aircraft maintenance personnel, flight despatchers, security staff and many others.
It is extremely challenging for any airline to achieve such high levels of punctuality. Many of the elements that affect performance are beyond its control such as weather, air traffic control issues, Customs and Immigration control formalities, bird strikes, airport congestion, etc.
The airline industry defines a flight as being on-time if it arrives or departs within 15 minutes of its scheduled time.
Airports and airlines are rated for flights arriving and departing throughout their hub airports and global networks on this basis.
SriLankans route network presently covers 105 cities in 47 countries with a sophisticated all-Airbus fleet that has been modernized recently with the induction of brand new A320neo, A321neo and A330-300 aircraft.

State Minister Dr Sudarshani Fernandopulle yesterday registered her strong opposition to the proposed Amendment to Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to bring down the first-past-the-post representation to 60 percent.
Her resistance came immediately after Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha told the media at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo that the said Amendment would be presented to Parliament next week.
Fernandopulle, who addressed the same press conference, pointed out the new Amendment would lead to a reduction of female representation in LG bodies.
As the leader of SLFP Womens Front I strongly urge Minister Musthapha not to present this Amendment to Parliament. If presented, I will use my vote against the Bill.
The women will be denied of 25 percent quota if this Amendment is adopted, Fernandopulle insisted.
Minister Musthapha reacting to her comments maintained that the problem could be resolved through negotiation.
I respect her views. We will consider them. Hopefully we will be able to reach a common ground, the minister responded.

## Title: The Thing about E.T.

The Thing about E.T.
Today, I am going to break another promise. I wanted to feature one English movie and one alternative language movie every week, but this time, I could not resist the temptation of featuring two Hollywood movies whose central character is an alien  one loveable, the other terrifying.
The two movies in question are Steven Spielbergs E.T. The Extra Terrestrial and John Carpenters The Thing. Both directors were at the top of their game when the two movies came out within weeks of each other in the summer of 1982. That was incidentally a golden year for movies, with Poltergeist, Road Warrior, Conan the Barbarian, Tron, Rocky III, Star Trek: Wrath of Khan and Fast Times at Ridgemont High also playing at cinemas around the world.
Everyone loved the cuddly alien in ET, left behind on Earth by his parents and cared for by Eliot (Henry Thomas) and his friends. The public reception to ET was so warm that the shape-shifting, utterly evil alien in The Thing had no chance. The movie was a box office bomb and a disaster with the critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times even asked filmgoers to watch Howard Hawks 1951 B & W movie The Thing from Another World instead. But over the years, the magic of home video and fading memories of the adorable alien from ET transformed the perception of The Thing in the eyes of cinemagoers. First on VHS, then Laserdisc, DVD and finally Blu Ray, The Thing gained a wider following, critical acclaim and ultimately, cult status. Today, it is generally regarded as one of the best science fiction and horror movies ever made. Carpenter, director of the acclaimed Halloween, was just unlucky to see his film released just three weeks after ET. Time can indeed be kind even to shape shifting, absolutely revolting aliens.
The Thing (1982)
The Thing is a re-imagining of Howard Hawkes The Thing From Another World, which in turn is based on John W Campbells award-winning novella Who Goes There (1938). Whereas the 1951 movie depicted The Thing in humanoid form, Carpenters version stayed true to the source material and portrayed the alien as a shape-shifting organism that can literally take the form of any animal or human.
The story is fairly simple  a team of 12 researchers led by R.J. MacReady (Kurt Russell) in Antarctica finds an ancient alien spaceship buried deep in ice, from which a terrifying alien wakes up. That alien infects their dogs (it initially takes the form of a dog) and one or more of the humans. At this stage, it becomes a terrifying guessing game  are you human or not . It becomes a matter of trust and friendship, but even the best of relationship can falter in the face of unspeakable evil. Yes, The Thing seems to be a creature movie, but deep inside, it is a study of human bonds and the limits of trust in a claustrophobic setting. The men are engulfed by paranoia, distrust, and outright fear of one another and everything around them. You simply cannot this kind of terror in Antarctica.
This is one movie whose special effects (done mainly by a very young Rob Bottin) still stand up very well after 35 years. They are not easy to watch even now. A head that walks on legs like a spider does  You got it. A stomach that opens to reveal jaws-like teeth  The Thing has it. And those are just two examples. And helping the movie along is a great score by Ennio Morricone and excellent camerawork by Dean Cundey. One little fact  this is an all-male movie, with no female characters. A bit Politically Incorrect today, but back in 1982 it was not much of a problem.
This is one movie which gained a very wide following on home video. If you have the 1998 Pioneer/Universal Signature Collection Widescreen THX certified Laserdisc with Dolby Surround Sound, keep it at all costs. The next best thing is the Collectors Edition DVD from 2000, which I have. But if you do not have the movie on disc, there are two new options available. Arrow Video will release a brand new The Thing Blu Ray from a 4K restoration in October this year in the UK, but this is already sold out. The next best option is a 2K restoration released last year by Shout Factory in the USA , which is reported to be the best home video version of the movie so far and is widely available. This disc has three audio commentaries including the one from the laserdisc by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell, John Carpenter's The Thing: Terror Takes Shape documentary, The Making of The Thing, Requiem for a Shapeshifter featuring John Carpenter being interviewed by Mick Garris and The Men of Outpost 31 featuring interviews with several of the supporting players. If you like the musical score, just try the soundtrack on CD or Vinyl. If you like The Thing, also check out the Alien and Prometheus movies, John Carpenters They Live, Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Slither. One final fun fact  whats the German title for The Thing  Das Ding, of course.
E.T. The Extra Terrestrial (1982)
Who has not seen ET  I confess I did not see it in 1982, but I saw it VHS a few years later. Captivating audiences of all ages, this timeless story follows the unforgettable journey of a lost alien and the 10-year-old boy he befriends. Join Elliot (Henry Thomas), Gertie (Drew Barrymore) and Michael (Robert MacNaughton) as they come together to help E.T. find his way home.
The story is timeless  a little alien is left behind on Planet Earth and a group of human friends help to phone home so that he can get back to his home planet. But it is not so easy  Federal agents want the creature dead or alive and ET and his friends have to find ingenious ways to evade capture. You are not human (or alien) if you do not shed a tear while watching this masterpiece. In the words of one critic E.T. remains as funny, thrilling, touching and powerful today as it was in 1982, and it would be tough for anyone -- young or old, boy or girl, newcomer or longtime fan -- to come away without having laughed, gasped, cried or cheered, for the first time or the hundredth. Yes, it is that powerful and emotional.
But before we get carried away, suffice to say that ET is a rousing adventure for all times. Note that Spielberg did make a few changes to home video editions, such as replacing the Feds guns with walkie talkies, but unlike his friend George Lucas who has meddled so much with Star Wars that he himself cannot remember the changes, Spielberg provides both versions on home video.
Talking of home video, hold on to your Signature Collection and THX certified Dolby Surround Laserdisc or the Universal Collectors Edition DVD if you have them. I do, and it has both the digitally manipulated and original versions. But if you are new to the movie, it is better to opt for the 4K Ultra HD Blu Ray, which will be out on September 12 this year. This special gift set features premium packaging, includes a re-mastered CD soundtrack of the original Grammy Award-winning album, is packed with over three hours of bonus features and includes a collector's booklet with behind-the-scenes stories and rare images from the archives.
E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial 35th Anniversary Limited Edition retains all the excitement, drama and warm-hearted humor that made it an instant worldwide classic. Among the special features are: The E.T. Journals - Retrace the day-to-day experience of creating E.T from never-before-seen, behind-the-scenes footage shot by Academy Award-winning cinematographer John Toll; Steven Spielberg & E.T. - Watch an interview with Steven Spielberg, as he reflects back on the film and discusses his experience working with the actors, as well as his overall and current perspective on E.T.; The Music of E.T.: A Discussion with John Williams - Interviews and footage focused on the long-standing relationship between John Williams and Steven Spielberg; The E.T. Reunion - The cast and filmmaker reunite to discuss their thoughts on the impact of the film. If you like E.T., do checkout Starman, coincidentally directed by John Carpenter.

Think out of the box in digital age,  FCA President tells chartered accounts
Addressing the FCA Convocation at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka), its President Lasantha Wickremasinghe said that they should take greater responsibility in shaping the profession to meet with increasing stakeholder expectations.
Chairman of the CA Member Relations Committee Thivanka Jayasinghe delivering the welcome speechChairman of the University Grants CommissionProf. Mohan de Silva speaking at the event
The distinguished FCA designation was conferred to 201 chartered accountants by the institute, elevating them to the highest stratum in their professional career. The new fellow members of CA Sri Lanka included high profile corporate leaders.
The world we live in is moving fast and amidst this fast paced change, we are also witnessing a technological revolution, and this revolution is having a great impact not only in the way we live, but it also impacts all professionals, including ours, he said.
Wickremasinghe said that gone were the days when everyone relied on conventional ways to carry out operations and the technological revolution has changed everything, including the way business is done and the manner in which people communicate.
This revolution has also had an impact on our accounting profession, where certain methods which were considered an inherently human process, are today being automated, he said.
He explained that this was why it was important for chartered accountants, including the new fellow members to think out of the box and be ready to embrace change, as well as know how to convert challenges into opportunities and continue to be at the helm, in driving organisations to success. Chairman of the CA Member Relations Committee Thivanka Jayasinghe, said that the fellow status, more commonly known as FCA, is given to members as its highest level of membership. This premier status of the accounting profession in Sri Lanka will provide you with greater responsibility now. The professional standards that are expected of a chartered accountant, are extremely challenging and I am sure the FCA status will give you even more strength to maintain this standard, he added.
University Grants Commission Chairman Prof. Mohan de Silva disclosed that the Independent Quality Assurance and Accreditation Authority Bill will be submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers for approval and this would be the way forward to develop Sri Lankas higher education future.

Tribute: Elaine Fernando : A sister par excellence
A sister is a gift to the heart, a friend to the spirit, a golden thread to the meaning of life. This quote wonderfully describes what my eldest sister Elaine meant to me, when my darling Mummy entered Eternal Glory to be with her Maker.
My sister Elaine was the eldest of the family with three younger sisters and two younger brothers. She was always a loving and caring sister to whom we always looked up to.
I was her youngest brother and being 14 years younger to her, most naturally, I enjoyed a special love where much of her loving attention was showered on me. It developed in to an affectionate and strong bond between the two of us.
When my Mother was stricken with cancer and bedridden for nearly three years, she nursed her along with my other three sisters.
My part was to massage her legs and arms when I returned home after school.
My mothers death made a vast impact on my father's curriculum of work as Magister Magistorum and a legend of Royal College Colombo. My sister Elaine stepped in and quite rightly provided my father with the comfort and solace needed both at school and at home.
Elaine was educated at Princess of Wales College, Moratuwa. She studied up to the Senior Cambridge and participated in the school's activities. She married Christopher Fernando, who was teaching in a school at Tangalle. He too hailed from Moratuwa and finally came to live with us when he got an appointment to teach at S.Thomas College Mt. Lavinia.
Elakka lives with her son and daughter-in-law, while her daughter lives in Canada. She is blessed with five grand children and eight great-grand children.
Elakka, my eldest sister has touched the lives of many relatives and friends whenever her services were needed because of her altruistic attitude in life. She gave her compassion and kindness to each and everyone who moved with her and her inspiration and courage at every moment of their lives.
It is said that there is no better friend than a sister and she is a friend to me whose memories I will always cherish in my heart.
Elakka continues to focus on Jesus Christ at all times.

Unique Characters!
For the thespians of Dharmaraja drama has been a process of maturation. Dramatic Moves features the English Literary and Drama Association of Dharmaraja College Kandy where drama has enabled one to become a man of the world.
Teacher in Charge of the English Literary and Drama Association (ELDA), Shanthi Kumari Navaratne feels that drama teaches you lesson for life.
According to my knowledge, The English Literary and Drama Association of Dharmaraja started sometime back in the 1930s. Ive seen some pictures in the archives. In a paper cutting from the British Bulletin, I saw the committee there, and the year was 1932. I
dont know whether it was started in 1932 or long before that, but the picture says 1932. So it has a very long history and still we are functioning very well. Our students take part in the competitions and go for national levels and they win places, said Navaratne.
Navaratne feels that the biggest thing students gain from drama is Exposure.
We encourage children to take part in extracurricular activities. When children work in teams and when they go for competitions what they get is exposure and a stage to showcase their talents. I have been in the profession a long time and this is my 39th year. My reward is, when my past pupils ( I have been working in girls school as well) come and talk to me, and tell me that they are doing well and they have learnt so much from school, that is my reward, explained Navaratne.
Putting together a production is hard work and takes a lot of effort.
We used to get help from professionals as well. But during the last few years we couldnt do that. We work as a team. We have a lot of English teachers here. So we used to get professional helps especially for Shakespeare dramas, added Navaratne.
Navaratne believes giving the students freedom can bring out the best in them.
Suppose we are practicing for a drama, we give them the script and give them the freedom as well. When meeting a deadline for a performance of course discipline is involved as well, said Navaratne.
Whatever the lessons they learn in school, drama or their academic subjects, what they learn is lessons for life. The experience and exposure I have got from my school is a lesson for life, pointed out Navaratne.
Navaratne recalls that in 2000, they did Romeo and Juliet for Shakespeare and they won the Best Outstation School Best Actors Award and felt that it was really unforgettable!
Not black or white
President ELDA, Sasanka Yakandawala feels that they have gained insights into the gray areas of life.
When it comes to the drama culture at Dharmaraja there is a lot of enthusiasm and there is a lot of talent when it comes to acting. We may not have taken part in many of the drama competitions as of late, but there is great talent and great enthusiasm at Dharmaraja, said Yakandawala.
We have great actors and great orators at Dharmaraja. Most of the youngsters in Grade 5, 6 &7 are very keen on acting. Some of the aspects we have delved into are love and the realities of life. It is not black or white out there. There are lots of shades of gray as well. Drama is another way of looking at life - What is outside, explained Yakandawala.
When preparing for a deadline for a competition, the boys have a meeting with the teacher in charge and the executive committee as well.
We then prepare a plan and a timeline. There are great teachers here who are great at directing and making scripts as well. We get the help of the students as well. We formulate a plan and execute it, meeting the deadline, said Yakandawala.
Yakandawala felt that it is a novel way of teaching.
Drama is another way of looking at life. As I said before, it is not just black and white but there are a lot of shades of gray as well. It is a good way of teaching students what life is really about without giving them a lecture. It is a more enjoyable way of teaching students as to what life is, elucidated Yakandawala.
Yakandawala feels that Les Miserables is one of his favorites and feel that the characters are definitely interesting.
With the modern trend of tuition and high competition to get into Universities, students are drifting away from drama and other extracurricular activities. I think that is the main challenge we have. They dont have the time to invest in these things. So we need to find a way to circumnavigate. That is the main challenge. Even on Sundays they have classes. We have a wealth of talent but they dont have the time, pointed out Yakandawala.
When considering the Drama circuit Colombo and Kandy are pretty competitive.
If you do drama you acquire a lot of skills. You get skills just by observing. It is not like watching a movie. In a drama you have to interpret it on your own. Several people may have several different interpretations of the same drama. So that is a very good way of developing your skills, informed Yakandawala.
Getting into the skin of a character comes to you naturally once you read the whole script and practice it.
Now you have youtube and you can watch it. So you can get an idea about how to get about it. My whole family is really supportive of what I do. Integrating as a group can be quite hectic with different mindsets and opinions. We need to find a clear path, taking all of them together. But you need to have one goal and one mindset. It is quite hectic, but it is also good. It gives you a great deal of tolerance and develops team work, said Yakandawala.
Practice, practice and practice!
Secretary of the ELDA, Vishwa Pathirana believes practice make perfect!
When enacting complicating roles I would say Practice, practice and practice! However we tend to let our actors be a bit flexible with their characters, so that they can add a little bit of their individual flair to the characters that their playing. We dont insist on them playing the characters by memorizing the scripts, but by actually understanding the character itself. So a lot of research about the characters like Julius Caesar is done, explained Pathirana.
Pathirana, like the President feels that there is a lot of enthusiasm when it comes to drama.
There is a lot of enthusiasm. Especially the younger students in grades 6, 7 and 8, although there was a very low point in drama at Dharmaraja about 2 -3 years ago, interest is now picking up once again, said Pathirana.
Drama has been a source of great maturation for Pathirana.
I believe that I am more mentally mature than when I was a beginner in drama. I believe that drama has also given me a range of perspectives about the world and life, added Pathirana.
Pathirana feels that preparation varies from character to character.
As I stated earlier we conduct a lot of background research about the character, the society and life at the time to get a more in depth knowledge about the character. Also we obtain recordings of great performances and derive inspiration from them as well, pointed out Pathirana
Drama at Dharmaraja is in good hands.
We rejuvenated the drama sector at our school which was experiencing a low point and have recognized great actors at our school and we have trained them as well as we could, shared Pathirana.
For Pathirana, drama has affected him deeply and profoundly.
Sometimes Ive found that drama has given me answers and has given me refuge especially during times of grief and heartbreak. Integrating as a group is exhilarating and at times confusing. There are so many different ideas, mindsets and agendas in a group but, weve always managed to put aside our differences and work towards a common goal, explained Pathirana.

University Education: What We    should do in future : Education  the pathway to success
We live in a time when knowledge is ever more vital to our societies and economies,in a world where there is a rapidly circulating capital and people and revolutionary communication technologies. Our universities need to help drive forward the economy of the nation, and funds we invest in our teaching and research need to be transformed into highly skilled graduates that contribute to the economy. And our research should lead to innovation. Knowledge is replacing other resources as the main driver of economic growth, and education has increasingly become the foundation for individual prosperity and social mobility. Higher education generates broader economic growth as well as individual success. In the world many universities earn much money and send their graduates to serve in other countries (export of knowledge). Our universities should support our strength.
We have 15 public universities operating in the country. It is true that university education has been gradually expanded by various governments. At present, we have matured universities as well as young universities. When our society proceeds, we need to look into present failures and omissions. Also, we should improve the quality of our education and look forward to the dynamics of education. This article makes an attempt to fill this gap.
Education
Sri Lanka is famous for public welfare and hence for free education at all the levels from grade one to university, technical colleges and other vocational institutions. When education is taken as a single service or a good, it is an investment in people, a basic social service, known as a merit good, and a source of human capital. An individuals earnings are related to his cognitive skills. Education also promotes the entrepreneurial skills of people as well as technology. It is a strong weapon that can be raised against poverty and enhances capability of people who receive it. World Bank says that knowledge, an output of education, illuminates every economic transaction, revealing preferences, giving clarity to exchange and informing markets. By so doing, education strengthens a market system. Moreover, education enriches human rights, which enrich labour and capital, make the land resource conducive for production, enhance the efficiency of the government, and which provide ultimately a friendly environment for the competition and the smooth functioning of the market.Also, education is a part of the distribution branch of the government.
Thus, education increases income level of people in an economy while it keeps inequality in income distribution low. Even if education brings about a lot of advantages, in our country contribution of education to the nation needs to be reviewed. Education is popular, but percentage of people who receive higher education is still absolutely lower. Therefore, ranking of the country according to human capital index is also lower. Negative aspects of the society is also higher according crime rate, road accidents and corruption (see table below).
What are the purposes/functions of universities
Universities are known as: Institutions dedicated to the learning and personal development of their members, especially students. It is the obligation to equip graduates so that they can obtain viable employment;Sources of expertise and vocational identity. The role of universities as repositories and generators of knowledge, Creators, testers, and sites for the evaluation and application of new knowledge (creation of knowledge); Contributors to society and nations.The obligation to offer rational and timely criticism in areas of public policy and social and economic life.
In short, universities are meant for creation and dissemination of knowledge.
According to Eric Thomas, a former Vice Chancellor of the University of Bristol, the main functions of higher education and universities are predominantly two-fold. One is as educational establishments and the second as generators of knowledge and technology. As educational establishments, their function is to provide able, self-directed learners that are independent and confident, and will go out into society and give their service to the society through leadership or through civic duties. As knowledge generators, they are research institutions which provide new knowledge, to change paradigms, to aid society in its development and in meeting new challenges as they come along.
A former Vice-Chancellor of University of Leeds explains the main function of the university as making a significant contribution to civil society. Obviously, the education that we provide to our students, preparing them for their contribution to society is a key function. We create new knowledge.
That is a key and important part of any research-led intensive university. The link between the two is particularly important to us. We think they feed off each other, and of course, interpreting all of that into things that are of use, and that have an impact on society. Those, to us, would be the key functions of any university.All these views on education are consistent with the functional theory of education which explains that education enriches the society by creating human capital. In addition, universities can be used to earn foreign exchange.
What should we do in our universities
Our university has now called for applications for the post of Vice Chancellor. Those who apply for this post should explain what he/she will do for in the university in the case of being appointed. As a university teacher, I propose as follows.
1. Ranking of the university should be improved
Sri Lankan universities are still ranking at lower levels. Therefore, on one hand, improving the ranking of our universities makes education market attractive in neighbouring countries. On the other hand it promotes quality of university education. This can be partially achieved by improving both research quantity and quality. In addition to current arrangements, establishment of research panel in each faculty and among faculties will be helpful for this.
Broadening research contacts with government research institutions will also be a subsidiary strategy in achieving this objective. Finally, to raise or to maintain research quality it is better to have the best scholars in positions of power - the Dean, the Head of Department and the course coordinators.
2. Quality of education needs to be improved
In our country, education has not significantly contributed to growth and development. It should be corrected. We still have to improve teacher quality and teaching quality. Some teachers have limited scope to manage with English.
This is usually seen in faculties of humanities, social sciences and management. Due to that their research output is also very low. To achieve this end we have to modify the practice of recruitment and promotion. In general, recruitment on favours to academic staff of universities is substantially rare. However, there are some irregularities in some promotions, especially to professorships. For both recruitments and promotions there are some circulars issued by the UGC. However, promotions to professorships are offered to underqualified members and sometimes qualified members are not promoted. Sometimes those who have not published even a single journal article and do not hold doctoral degrees have been promoted to the professorship. Now this type of professors work as subject experts of other applicants who apply for the professorship.
University professors should be academics who are familiar with university education in foreign universities and they should be accepted by foreign universities. However, this type of under qualified professors do not belong tothat group. Only thing is, when somebody applies for a promotion to professorship, even if a subject expert proposes unqualified applicant or does not propose a qualified applicant for the promotion to a professorship, in the existing system, such experts are not/cannot be questioned about that.
In addition to recruitment and promotions, competition among teachers needs to be promoted further. Sometimes we need to have a behavioural change in our academics. In addition to present programs for academics, we need to have a system of annual assessment for teachers.
When we look at the problem of having qualified academics (or retaining experts in the country), we can look at the problem from the other side of the pipe. Universities as well as the public sector (and sometimes the whole society) are responsible to retain qualified academics. Salary alone is not an attractive reason for these people.
We can observe outward skilled labour migration in Sri Lanka. Recently in a newspaper, it was published that 38 academics in our university (university of Sri Jayewardenepura) went abroad have disappeared. Many experts leave the country with the view of having a friendly and healthy environment to live and seeking better educational opportunities for their children.
Many experts who leave the country say and ask us can we safely drive a vehicle in this country, can we get something done by a public institution, can a young girl go alone somewhere out of the residence and come back safely, can we enroll our kids in a public school without offering a reward and so on. To overcome this problem our public sector needs to be made more efficient and human culture in the country needs to be changed. When we take school education into account, even if the student-teacher ratio is too low in our country,almost all students enrolled in public schoolsare not satisfied with teaching in their schools and hence they go to private tuition classes. We know very well regarding the hardships we have to undergo when we go to a public school to enroll our kids. Once our media revealed that the public school education is the most corrupted sector in this country. Thus, retainingqualified academics is not only a duty of universities but our culture and the whole society are also responsible for it.
In universities knowledge is mainly distributed in the classroom. It should further be conducive for learning. At present, continuous assessment of students are not implemented as proposed. Assessment of students needs to be modified. For examples, there should be a minimum pass mark level for continuous assessment for the students and assessment needs to be diversified in respect of each module i.e abrupt interviews, written tests, take home assignments etc. Adoption of easy learning methods is another strategy. Generally a lecture note in software form is provided to the student before the beginning of the lecture (sometimes several days before the lecture). Better if these be policies in the universities.
3. New faculties
University of Sri Jayewardenepura has now seven faculties with the newly established two faculties namely Engineering and Technology. The university is now turning to be the biggest university in the country. The newly established two faculties have to be developed along the avenues that may contribute to growth and development of the country. In these faculties, when departments are created and degree programs are designed we have to be careful about the requirements of present and future national economy as well as global economy. We essentially should be careful about international trade and foreign direct investment.
4. Postgraduate education needs to be developed
In the case of medicine, only Colombo University offers postgraduate professional programs. If one more postgraduate institute is established more medical experts can be produced for the country. In the case of other faculties, we do not have full-time postgraduate students. By encouraging students to register for postgraduate programs, just after completion of their first degrees this can be partially achieved.
5. Additional steps
No gain without pain. Therefore, to promote competitionthere should be a performance-based additional allocation of funds for departments and some faculties and some other times to universities. Sometimes, universities can stretch their helping hands to lower level educational institutions namely schools. University leaders should have good academic relations with government authorities, and other relevant institutions at home as well as in overseas. This is not easy as it is proposed. However, attempts can be made by several activities. Firstly, public and private authorities can be invited for lectures in the universities. Secondly, university academics and students can visit private and public organizations from time to time.
Many of the ideas discussed above are consistent with the functional theory of education and this short note reaches to its end by stating an idea given to me by one of my friends in the legal profession. When someone thinks poorly, he works poorly.
Ultimately, his performance is also poor. We think poorly and work poorly. That is why we still remain underdeveloped. Now time has come for us to think efficiently.

We allowed India to get  momentum back  coach Pothas
With India three down for 133 the game was evenly balanced at one stage but by the end of the day the visitors had taken the advantage when they finished on 344-3.
From that point onwards we didnt perhaps execute as well as we had done up to that point. We just released the pressure a little bit. That was the turning session. India got momentum back, said Sri Lanka coach Nic Pothas at the end of the first day of the second Test at the SSC.
We were probably a fraction short on that wicket. The wicket is very slow and once the ball becomes old you dont have many weapons as compared to a harder ball. We dont have to watch the TV and say that, he said.
We know (Cheteswar) Pujara scores on the leg-side. Thats what he has done throughout all his career. We were little bit guilty in not getting the ball into other areas and bowling to his strengths. But thats Test match cricket and thats why he is a quality cricketer. (Ajinkya) Rahane came and played very well very positive which is what you expect. This is day one and its Test match cricket. Its about how you bounce back.
On the question of how well India plays spin Pothas said, We just finished playing Zimbabwe and the plan they came up with is quite different from what the Indians came up with against spin. This is Test match cricket. The strength of the players is how well they adapt. Our guys have done it very well. The Indians have played well too. Its like a game of chess. They make a move and then we make a move. The difference is that you dont get much time to make that move.
Reflecting on Sri Lanka batting at Galle Pothas said, We are very honest in our change room. We sat together as a group and the batters themselves said that they were disappointed.
The length of time we exerted pressure on the Indian bowlers. Thats something that all the teams in the world want to do. Thats something that we want to improve on. When a team makes 600 and 3 wickets down declare, you would expect that. We are a very close family in that change room and the discussions are very honest.
Rahul not disappointed over run out
Indian opener Lokesh Rahuls whose innings of 57 was rudely cut off by an unfortunate run out over a misunderstanding with his partner Cheteswar Pujara said that he was not upset by the incident.
I wasnt upset with him. Run outs happen, it could have happened with anybody. It could have been him who got run out and it could have been my mistake. I wasnt disappointed about that. I was disappointed because I have been away from the game so long and I didnt want to get out at all, said Rahul.
I wanted to be in the middle, play as many balls as I could. I was disappointed about that.
I was looking good and just after lunch, a crucial time as a batsman you can capitalise and get a lot of runs during in that session. I was disappointed that I got out at that time, he said.
Commenting on the SSC pitch, Rahul said that he expected it to turn from the bowlers footmarks as the match progressed.
It's completely different from the one we played on the last time around.
When we saw the wicket a couple of days ago, we did expect the wicket to be the same as last time, but today we turned up and the wicket was different, said Rahul.
It was on the slower side and I think it will take turn as the days go. The more the footmarks, the more turn and purchase Ashwin and Jadeja can get.
It has crumbled a bit. But like I said a little bit on the slower side but with the footmarks, the ball will do something.
