The boy I knew has become a man - Drogba on Lukaku
When I look at what Romelu Lukaku is doing at this World Cup, I am so proud.
Romelu is a player and person I have a special relationship with. I have known him for seven years, since he first came to Chelsea at the age of 18 in 2011, and we are really close.
He is more than my very good friend, he is a kid I love and he is like my younger brother - someone I have always tried to help.
I know things have not always been easy for him but the reason he is doing so well in Russia is down to the character he has shown throughout his career and the hard work he has put in to get here.
Of course, Belgium are creating lots of chances for him - if you have Eden Hazard, Kevin de Bruyne and Dries Mertens behind you, then as a striker you know they will provide food for you. But the rest is down to him. I had service like that at Chelsea, and I always thought to myself: 'If you don't eat well now, then you are the one responsible.'
What I mean by that is if you have got people delivering good balls to you then if you miss it is your fault - and that is the mentality Romelu has got too.
As we have seen, he is not missing now - he has scored four goals from five shots in the two games he has played so far - and I would put that down to the fact that, as a player, he is a perfectionist. If you have a desire to always improve like he does, then in the end it pays off.
'AT THE START HE WAS RAW - HE HAD TO WORK ON EVERYTHING'
The first time I spoke to Romelu, he was a young boy and still at Anderlecht.
My friend Vincent Kompany put him on the phone and Romelu told me he was a big Chelsea fan and I was his idol - he had my name on the back of his shirt, and a poster of me on his wall.
A few years later, the boy was with us, sitting next to me in the Chelsea dressing room.
I got him that space, because he was supposed to be the next Chelsea striker, so I wanted him to feel comfortable, to learn and understand the spirit of the team from me.
I wanted to pass on to him my advice and experience of the club - that is why he was there.
Right from the start, he had to work hard. I remember when he first came to the club he was not doing the full training sessions sometimes - they would take him to one side and make him work on his first touch, his passing - everything. When he was young he was very raw. Powerful and physical, yes - always.
I always challenged him and told him that he needed to get leaner and he would be a different player - faster, and more agile at moving and turning.
He has done that. When I look at the player he is now and the one he was seven years ago, there is a big difference. If you go through the different parts of his game, there is quality everywhere.
'HE DOES NOT LACK CONFIDENCE, HE JUST WANTS TO IMPROVE'
It did not work out for Romelu at Chelsea but we have stayed in touch all this time, and we still speak a lot. I'm pleased that he says I was able to help him.
He would always call me for advice, or to ask how to do things differently, but that was never down to a lack of confidence - just his desire to improve.
As I said in my TV analysis after he scored twice against Tunisia, we have talked a lot about the runs he makes, the angles he takes and his footwork when he is through on goal.
The short steps he took before he scored his first goal in that game were just like the ones a tennis player takes just before they hit the ball, and they give you more accuracy.
That was great to see but, when I talked to him after Belgium had played Panama, we spoke about one of the chances he had and I told him what he could have done better in that situation than the touch he took with his left foot.
Romelu explained he was trying to beat the defender but I said you need to focus on your first touch so it would have been better to control with your right and then get in front of the defender that way.
He watched it again and said: "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah - you were right."
There is an example of how much he wants to learn. When you hear that, you can tell he is going to reach the top. He is not there yet, but he is almost there.
'MOURINHO UNDERSTOOD THE BOY HAS BECOME A MAN'
I have heard Romelu say his determination to win is the most important thing he has learned from me, and I think it is a big part of him as a player.
Like I always say, you can be at 70% of your potential but you still have to give 100% of that because it can be enough to win a game.
Part of that is your attitude. For me there was always a difference between being in the dressing room and being around the lads - joking and having fun - and the moment I stepped out on the field.
I changed, and I think he noticed that when he watched me when he was young. He respected that and I can see he is the same now too. He showed that at Manchester United last season.
I also know United manager Jose Mourinho well, of course, from our time at Chelsea and I can see why he got the best out of Romelu at Old Trafford.
I think Jose understood when he signed him for United last year that the boy has become a man. He was mature and ready for a challenge like playing for a club like United.
Romelu did so well because he has got the confidence of the manager, but also because he is at the age where he knows how to pay that confidence back.
'WITH LUKAKU IN FORM, BELGIUM HAVE A CHANCE'
I am still challenging him, for example to get more goals for United next season than the 27 he got last season, and to get the Golden Boot at this World Cup too.
We do not always talk about work, though. I have been to see him at Belgium's training camp in Moscow and we did not speak seriously then.
I know his team-mates Eden Hazard, Marouane Fellaini and their assistant coach Thierry Henry as well, and it was nice to speak to them all about everything and nothing.
It was just normal chat between friends, making jokes about players and watching Croatia's win over Argentina at the same time.
We were just having fun and it was clear that Romelu and the Belgium squad are in a good place, not just playing well and winning games.
That is one of the reasons I am backing them to do so well at this tournament, and with Romelu in this sort of form, they definitely have a chance. - BBC

Apartments account for only 1.7% of Colombos residential facilities
Apartments currently account for only 1.7% of Colombos residential facilities despite the scarcity of land to cater to rapid urbanisation, an industry leader disclosed.
Representing Altair as a Director of the iconic development and the Condominium Developers Association of Sri Lanka (CDASL) as its Chairman, Pradeep Moraes told the Sri Lanka Investment & Business Conclave (SLIBC) that even after the 12,000 apartments currently under construction are completed over the next three to four years, this figure would only rise to about 4 to 5%.
In contrast, apartments account for as much as 70% of living accommodation in central Kuala Lumpur, 80% of central Bangkok and 90% of central Mumbai, Moraes said.
He said that condominium living was the only solution to increasing urbanisation in areas like Colombo. To page iv
He pointed out that if the area occupied by the Altair project had been allocated for houses, it would have been able to accommodate 54 minimum-sized units at most, whereas the developments twin towers offer 400 spacious luxury apartments, with as much as 45% of total space set aside for public areas, which is much more than the industry average.
The presentation, titled Residential Condominium Market - Sri Lanka targeted principally at foreign delegates attending the conclave, highlighted both the emotional arguments and the business rationale that underpin the attraction of the property development sector in Colombo, the fastest growing city in the MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index of 2015.
Moraes also disclosed that 90 per cent of luxury condominium purchases are equity based, and that on average, 65% of purchases are by resident Sri Lankans, 27% by expatriate Sri Lankans and 8% by foreigners.
Quoting the findings of the global real estate services firm Jones Lang Lasalle he said 98% of completed luxury condominiums projects in Colombo are sold out, while on average, 47% of projects under construction are sold out.
These findings are supported by statistics from RIU (Research Intelligent Unit) whose corresponding figures are 99% and 49% respectively. In the case of Altair, more than two thirds of its apartments have been sold.
Altair was the Platinum Sponsor of the 2018 SLIBC, themed Partnering for Prosperity was organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in association with BOI, the EDB, the Department of Commerce and the Sri Lanka Conventions Bureau.

Enterprise Sri Lanka will foster entrepreneurship: Minister
Entrepreneurship should be made the Engine of Growth in Sri Lanka and the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme will foster entrepreneurship found in the genes of Sri Lankans, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The Minister addressing the gathering at the 175th anniversary celebrations at the Matara St. Thomas Boys School said the world was achieving such rapid progress today that technology might make accountants and drivers many become superfluous in the future. But today we were languishing with an examination pattern centred on the examination system.
Out of nearly 250,000 students sitting the Advanced Level examination only about 25,000 qualified to enter universities. Some others seek education abroad depending on their parents financial abilities.
The tradition today was to consider the rest of the students as incompetent. But the truth was otherwise. They could never be described as incompetent.
We should confirm that this segment comprised competent people.Through the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme, the government was trying to support the entrepreneurship of this segment. The government was granting loans for this purpose and the entire interest or part of it was borne by the government.
History proved that Sri Lankans had displayed skills and talents as efficient entrepreneurs rather than the agriculture industry. Archaeological excavations conducted in areas such as Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa have unearthed coins belonging to foreign countries Therefore our duty was to provide strength on behalf of the youth generation to develop entrepreneurship skills embedded in our genes.
Our prime objective is to create 100,000 new entrepreneurs by 2020. The government has already taken steps to strengthen democracy and harmony needed for it.
Samaraweera said what was required was to create development upon those strong pillars to make entrepreneurship the engine of growth.

Japan nearly slayed the giant - cheers to tears for despairing fans
TOKYO, Tuesday: From Tokyo bars to a Buddhist temple, for millions of Japanese football fans the emotions were the same -- pinch-me optimism to crushing disappointment, all in the space of 25 agonising minutes.
As dawn broke over the country, during the closing stages of Japans last 16 match with Belgium in Rostov-on-Don, the Samurai Blue were 2-0 up and on course for their first World Cup quarter-final.
But by the final whistle, substitute Nacer Chadli had scored in injury time as Belgium fought back to win 3-2, stunning Japans packed bars and viewing areas into silence.
Im so frustrated, Ryota Iwakiri said bitterly at a bar in Tokyos Shinagawa business district, as others tried to hold back tears.
The game was like a roller-coaster. They let us dream of a victory at one point. They really had good momentum, said Yuki Kakishita, an employee at a real estate agency.
Fans at the bar, some dressed in their teams blue strip and with Japanese flags painted on their cheeks, had exploded with joy when Takashi Inui scored the teams second goal.
We were so excited when Japan took the lead. But Belgium were so tough, said Shimon Otomo, a businessman still wearing his suit and tie. Many fans at a public screening held their heads in their hands as Japans campaign came screeching to a halt.
At one Zen temple in the central prefecture of Shizuoka, hosting a public viewing event for the first time, the chief priest led fans in chanting a Buddhist sutra after the game.
We asked visitors to watch the game calmly but everyone, myself included, couldnt help but jump and shout when Japan scored, the priest, Taiko Ishida, told AFP.
It was a dramatic ending. The result was so regrettable, he added.
THEY SHOCKED THE WORLD
The result was painful despite the dire pre-tournament predictions for Japan, who dumped their coach in April and had not been expected to make it out of their group.
New coach Akira Nishino was also bitterly criticised for ordering the team to run down the clock in their final group stage match, knowing a 1-0 loss to Poland was enough to advance.
Former Japan international Daisuke Ichikawa believed Belgium enjoyed a big slice of luck with their first goal, Jan Vertonghens looping header from 20 yards, while ex-captain Ryuzo Morioka said: They (Japan) shocked the world.
Many fans also consoled themselves with the fact that the team made it so far, and got so close to an unprecedented quarter-final spot.
Japan nearly slayed the giant.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took to Twitter to praise the team, saying the entire country had been deeply moved by watching you do your best until the final second.
World Cup fever has gripped Japan despite a time difference that meant Mondays match aired from 3:00am on Tuesday local time.
In Tokyo, as the result sank in, people began to drift out of bars, heading into the subway where early-bird commuters were already making their way in to the office.
It was worth staying up late to watch it, said Otomo, polishing off a cocktail and straightening out his suit.
Ill have to go straight to the office now though, time to work hard again.  AFP

ADB to invest in lankas Healthcare Sector
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has agreed to invest $10 million of equity in DCDC Healthcare Services Private Limited (DCDCPL), a company providing dialysis and ancillary services to end stage renal disease, to help enable the establishment of critical healthcare infrastructure in India and Sri Lanka.
ADBs financing will also include a $5 million equity investment made on behalf of the Leading Asias Private Infrastructure Fund (LEAP), one of ADBs cofinancing vehicles dedicated to private sector infrastructure in Asia and the Pacific. The Japan International Cooperation Agency supports LEAP, launched in August 2016, through a $1.5 billion equity commitment.
The agreement was signed by ADB Principal Investment Specialist for Private Sector Operations Mayank Choudhary and DCDCPLs Founder and CEO Aseem Garg at a ceremony in New Delhi.
Founded in 2009, DCDCPL offers dialysis care at its public-private partnership (PPP) centers in government hospitals, along with its centers at private hospitals and two standalone clinics.
It is the second largest operator of PPP dialysis centers in India, and currently has close to 100 centers in operation with a total capacity of more than 800 dialysis machines. ADBs investment will allow the company to expand its network to more than 180 centers and increase its geographic presence by covering more states in India, as well as starting a network of centers in Sri Lanka.
ADB will also assist DCDCPL in capacity building, including developing human resources, improving systems and processes, and standardizing care quality.
We are pleased to invest in DCDCPL, which will enable it to expand its dialysis care infrastructure in India and Sri Lanka. This expansion will enhance access to critical dialysis care for a larger section of the population and enable them to continue to lead productive lives, said Choudhary. Supporting quality healthcare providers targeting provision of affordable health care is central to ADBs private sector strategy in India.

## Title: Advent of  Nattukottai  Chettiar  community
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Wednesday, July 4, 2018 - 01:00
Advent of  Nattukottai  Chettiar  community
Originally the Nattukottai Chettiar community hailed from a city called Chettinad in Tamil Nadu. Basically, they belong to one of the outstanding wealthier business communities in South India. It was said that originally Chettinad consisted nearly ninety-six villages, but with the passage of time, due to the emigration of the Chettiar population from the Chettinad land, the total number of villages in the Chettinad was reduced to seventy-five.
Despite its glory and prosperity, the land belongs to the dry zone which must be one of the major drawbacks for the occupants of the land. Maybe this is one of the major causes which might have forced this particular community to take refuge in different parts of India as well as in the neighbouring countries. This particular community with the passage of time migrated from their native South Indian city of Chettinad to numerous other regions of South India and other South East Asian countries. During the 19th century, they migrated to Sri Lanka, Burma, Java, Sumatra, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam.
Two towns
Devokoatti and Karikudi are the two major towns in the Sivaganga District in Chettinad. It is stated that the majority of the Nattukottai Chettiar community migrated to Sri Lanka from the above mentioned two towns in the 19th century. This particular community not only played a significant role in the economic and social spheres of Sri Lanka but also played a considerable role in the religious and cultural spheres.
Generally, the members of the Nattukottai Chettiar community are ardent devotees of Lord Murugan.
It is worthwhile to mention here that wherever they migrated they never failed to carry their distinct culture, tradition and religious faith with them. But it should be remembered that wherever the Chettiar community migrated they always maintained their strong links with their native homeland Chettinad.
They especially preserved their cultural and matrimonial ties with their own native villages in Chettinad. Their migration took place mostly in the early part of 19th-century and wherever they migrated they carried their religious and cultural footings in the alien lands.
Wherever they settled they had the habit of building magnificent Lord Murugan temples with excellent Dravidian architecture. Still, this evidence could be witnessed at the Colombo Sea Street.
In yesteryear, the Sea Street of Colombo was generally called Chettiar Street. The present location of Colombo Sea Street is referred to as Chettiar Theru in Tamil by the Tamil population.
The term Chettiar Theru means that the majority of the dwellers or the occupants of the street were Chettiar community. It is one of the noteworthy facts to be mentioned here that this particular community deeply cherished the Hindu religious and traditional values.
The Chettiar community cherished the Murugan cult in Hinduism. They had the habit of building a chain of Murugan temples in their migrated lands. Most of the excellent Hindu temples which are presently seen in Pettah were built by the Nattukoatti Chettiar community of yesteryear.
Strong evidence
The majority of the Nattukottai Chettiar community left Sri Lanka during the period of the 1950s, but the temples built by them stand as strong evidence for their immeasurable contribution to Hinduism in Sri Lanka. According to certain historical evidence, the Chettiar community first of all came and settled in the Galle District, but later shifted to Colombo and other parts of the country. The Nattukottai Chettiar community is also known by another name Nakarathar community. Among the local population, they enjoyed a prestigious position.
One of the outstanding features of the Nattukottai Chettiar is wherever they migrate; they adjust themselves with the local population and become an integral part of that society.
This wealthy community has the capability of establishing themselves with the existing local population. They usually establish strong links with different sections of the local public. The main intention and aim of the Chettiar community are to strengthen and secure their business interests in the migrated lands.
As far as Sri Lanka is concerned, they established themselves in different parts of the country such as Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Jaffna, and upcountry, Tissamaharama, Galle and Colombo.
Money business
The main profession of the Nattukottai Chettiar community was money lending on nominal interest rates.
In other words, they were the first to introduce the money lending business to the people of Sri Lanka. The tactics of Nattukottai Chettiar community in money management was unique. With the passage of time, they gradually gained popularity among the local population of Sri Lanka.
They also introduced the pawning business to Sri Lankans even before the establishment of commercial banks.
The methods they adopted in financial transactions got much more recognition and popularity among the local population. Gradually they gained more popularity among the local population of Sri Lanka, especially during the 19th century.

Behind  every mask
Lucien Bulatsinhalas childhood ended in 1956. He grew up in a coastal village known as Wedikanda in Rathmalana where fishery and Sea sand business was done and it was his childhood kingdom. Amongst his poor coconut leaves sheltered houses stood one Bangalow, where a high ranking officer of the Postal Department, a good Tamil gentleman by the name of Doresunderam lived.
All those around, who didnt know English including my father finally went to Doresunderam to get a government letter or a telegram read. We wanted to associate with his son Kumar and the daughter Rani but the class difference did not allow us to do so. But, we got the opportunity to talk with the family at the annual almsgiving held at the Bungalow where almost everyone in the village attended, Bulatsinhala reminisces.
At that time there was no ethnic or religious division like Tamil, Muslim or Burgher, but there was something called class difference. Sri Dharmaloka College, a Government assisted Buddhist College where Bulatsinhala studied in Rathmalana had in his class, a Tamil boy called Wellaiah and a Muslim girl by the name of Leela. But after 1956 because of the anti-Tamil movement co-existence vanished. Many families including Doresunderam family just disappeared.
We too had left Rathmalana when ethnic riots broke up in 1958. But, as an adult when I joined the State Clerical service in 1963 I had the opportunity to meet many Good Tamil and Muslim officers. Administrative officer K.C. Nithyanandan is one such person who is still in my memory.
Velupillai Arumugam helped him at a very decisive era in Bulatsinhalas life becomes second only to his parents.
When I joined the Government Clerical Service, I was registered as an external student at the Peradeniya University. My first appointment was to the District Agricultural Extension office at Nuwara Eliya. I pleaded before many Sinhala  Buddhist officers asking for a transfer to Head Office of the Agricultural Department in Peradeniya. I was given a transfer, not to Peradeniya but to Animal Husbandry Farm in Ambewela. Here again, I did not give up my struggle with the transfer. Velupillai Arumugam was the Manager at the Animal Husbandry Farm in Ambewela at that time. He was well aware of the struggle I was making, as all my correspondence requesting a transfer were referred to head office through him.
Before making his minute Velupillai Arumugam questioned Lucien Bulatsinhala.
What is the reason they are refusing to give the transfer
They are unable to find someone to replace me here at Ambewela
Is that the problem
The officer made the minute in English. Taking into consideration this young officer's university education, transfer this young officer to Peradeniya immediately. If it is difficult to find a replacement to send to Ambewela I will take responsibility to make arrangements to cover his duties.
If he did not do that kind minute on that day, a Lucian Bulathsinhala would not have emerged. That Lucian would not have had the opportunity to associate with one Bandula Jayawardane, Professor Sarachandra, Wimaladharma Diyasena, H.H.Banara, Wasanatha Kunara nor one G.W.Jayantha. Remove the mask" is my latest drama created in commemoration of all those good Tamil and Muslim people including that great person Velupillai Arumugam.
Bulatsinhalas play Ves Muhuna Galavanna (Remove the Mask) is centred around Colombo after the war.
Antique dealer Gamini Kalawarnes son Saliya is an entertaining, generous and a good young person. He is in love with Asokamala- a Karaoke singer in a nightclub. But Asokamala refuses his love. Saliyas best friend is the son of a Minister. He comes forward to help his friend who has been rejected and thereby insulted by this girl. He wants to win her for his friend even by force.
Asokamala and Saliya meet. She reveals to Saliya that she is a Tiger soldier in disguise as a Sinhala girl. Unable to bear the internal conflicts and cruelty within the Tiger Army she tried unsuccessfully to run away to India and is in a very destitute situation at present. Her intention is to migrate to Australia or India and continue her interrupted education. She says.
She further says that she has been brought up with the Sinhalese from her childhood and has been disappointed with the unreasonable treatments from the Sinhalese governments again and again which led her to join the Tiger army.

Brandix honoured as Lankas largest corporate blood donor
The Brandix Group has been recognised as the largest corporate blood donor in Sri Lanka for the eighth consecutive year, following the selfless contribution of over 4,000 pints of blood from inspired employees to the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) in 2017-18.
Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne presented Brandix with a special plaque of appreciation at a national ceremony on 14th June - World Blood Donor Day - in recognition of the Groups contribution. Significantly, the accolade was accepted on behalf of Brandix by the highest individual donor from the Group and a representative of the highest contributing factory from among the 26 Brandix locations that participated in the Group-wide blood donation drive.
Brandix has organised annual blood drives in collaboration with the NBTS for the past 11 years, during which, the Groups Associates have donated 28,534 pints of blood in total.
A commitment that has spanned over a period of 11 years is truly an inspiration to the corporate sector as well as our nation, and is representative of the kind of Inspired People that help make Brandix what it is today. As an organisation that is driven by its credo of Inspired Solutions, continuing our commitment to provide a solution to the nation to address the need of blood amongst our fellow citizens year on year has now become a calendar event at Brandix. We not only look forward to continuing this endeavour with the invaluable support of the NBTS in the years to come but will also continue to increase the number of pints of blood donated year on year, said Ishan Dantanarayana, Chief People Officer of the Brandix Group.
According to the NBTS, donations of this scale over a significant period of time are necessary to meet the establishments blood supply requirements. By being geographically widespread, the Brandix campaign increases supplies of blood in many areas, including those that do not often receive donations of a higher volume in comparison to areas like Colombo. Brandix blood donation campaigns are also conducted on weekdays instead of the general norm of weekends, which is particularly helpful in sustaining blood platelets that have a lifespan of five days, for use during the course of the week.

Bring on Brazil, say Belgium after late Japan drama
ROSTOV-ON-DON, Russia, Tuesday: Belgium passed a test of character with a display of true grit that bodes well for a World Cup quarter-final against Brazil, coach Roberto Martinez said after they came from 2-0 behind to beat Japan 3-2 in injury time.
In the World Cup you want to be perfect  but its about getting through, its about winning, said the Spaniard, who was hired after a side packed with English Premier League talent collapsed against Wales in the Euro 2016 quarter-final.
This is down to the personality, to the focus, to the desire, to the never-give-up-attitude of this group of players, said Martinez after substitute Nacer Chadli slammed home four minutes into stoppage time on Monday, breaking the hearts of Japan fans whose side scored twice early in the second half.
It was a test of character and you see the reaction of our subs coming on to win the game, he said. It tells you everything about this group of players. His other substitute, Marouane Fellaini, scored Belgiums 74th-minute equaliser.
Run ragged at times by the skilful and determined Samurai Blue, who are 58 places behind them at 61st in FIFAs world rankings, the Red Devils will look hard at their defensive frailties and difficulties in turning pressure into goals before they face Brazil in the quarter-final in just four days.
No negatives today, it was about getting through, Martinez insisted, offering the highest of praise for Japans skill and tactics. It is a day to be very proud of these players.
Keep believing in Belgium.
For the Brazil game, he said, his side would draw on the lessons of Rostov, when after an apprehensive first half as heavy favourites they had to attack with nothing to lose to get back into the match.
Against Brazil, who Martinez believes are the best side in the tournament, no one will expect too much from Belgium and the players are relishing that opportunity to try and cause an upset.
Captain Eden Hazard said that at 2-0 his side were having flashbacks to their humbling defeat by Wales two years ago.
But the reaction today was huge, Hazard said. Maybe this was the kind of game we needed, he added. Now, he said, playing Brazil is a dream.
Goalscorer Chadli called his winner a goal for an entire nation.
Martinezs 65th-minute substitutions, putting on Chadli for Dries Mertens and Manchester Uniteds towering Fellaini in the centre in place of Yannick Carrasco on the left, paid off.
At times his decision to rest almost his entire first team in a largely meaningless final group win over England on Thursday had looked questionable as Belgium struggled to find each other in the face of buzzing Japanese defence across the park.
But, as Japan coach Akira Nishino conceded, the strength in depth on the Belgian bench, well blooded after beating England 1-0, was to make the difference in the last 25 minutes.
The substitutions worked well, Chadli said.
Were all here to give it our all ... The bench told us to just go for because we were just not in the game.

Cabinet paper to provide suspended salaries submitted
A Cabinet paper proposing to provide postal workers whose weeks worth of salaries were suspended due to the recent strikes, had been submitted for approval, Posts, Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Minister Abdul Haleem said.
The minister was addressing a ceremony held yesterday at the Postal Headquarters to hand over appointment letters to the regional drivers of the department.
The postal strike lasted for two weeks prior to its conclusion on June 26. However, by June 19 we issued a notice urging workers to report to duty, adding that if they failed to comply, the department would consider them to have relinquished their posts. Hence, the issue is the workers not getting their salaries on those seven days, the minister said.
However, if Cabinet approval is received, we would be able to provide them their lost salaries, he added.
Meanwhile, the Postal Trade Union Alliance said they would commence another postal strike if the Postal Department failed to provide the salaries. Alliance Convener Chintaka Bandara said 26,000 workers were facing difficulties due to the issue and therefore, a strike would be called if the demands were not met by today. He added that all the post halted during the previous strike had been distributed.
Minister Haleem said the Postal Department had faced a total loss of Rs. 150 million due to the strike.

Cancer drug prices to be reduced in July
Prices of expensive cancer drugs will be reduced this month (July), Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne had stated that he will reduce the prices of expensive cancer drugs and the maximum price of the least expensive cancer drug will be Rs. 64,000. The Minister was speaking at the opening of the new Nutrition House in Ingiriya yesterday.
Minister Senaratne said that the price of a cancer drug which cost Rs. 285,000 in the past has been brought down to Rs. 144,000.
In the past, cancer patients died because they did not have money to buy the required drugs. But people thought they died because there were no drugs. In the past, only a limited amount of money (Rs. 1.5 million) was spent on one cancer patient, but now there is no such limit, he added.

Chamara Lakshans funeral today
The funeral of Resa and Silumina Editor-in-Chief Chamara Lakshan Kumara (39), will be held at the Indigodatenna cemetery in Mathugama at 5.00 p.m. today. Cortege leaves residence No:05 Athulathmudaligama, Mathugama at 4.00 pm.
Hundreds of journalists from ANCL and other print and electronic media houses paid their last respects over the last two days to Chamara, who revolutionised local print journalism with his innovative ideas. Among those who visited his residence to pay their last respects were ministers, politicians, artistes, academics and professionals. President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera had expressed their condolences.
Chamara had a circle of friends within an outside journalism who admired his down-to-earth attitude and easygoing personality. Chamara was the founder Editor of the nascent Resa newspaper, the latest venture of the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited.
Before joining the ANCL a couple of years ago, Chamara had worked for Lakbima and Rivira newspapers, where the respective managements noticed his innate journalistic brilliance. Chamara was given the reins of Resa after a brief stint with ANCL flagships Silumina and Dinamina.
Just a few months into his tenure at Resa, Chamara was appointed as Editor in Chief of Silumina, which went through a revolutionary change under his command. There was positive feedback from the readers to the redesigned and launched newspaper and surveys revealed that he had managed to attract young new readers to the Silumina for the first time in many years. Resa too carved a new niche in the local journalism arena, having given the other morning newspapers a run for their money with 16 pages of informative and entraining reading material. Chamara had a way with words which permeated to the two newspapers and he encouraged the young journalists working under him to explore new frontiers and go boldly in search of the truth. He was a perfectionist who demanded and got the best out of his young teams at Resa and Silumina.
Chamara not only had a way with words  he had a way with pictures, though he was not a photographer per se. He turned even the most mundane of news pictures into extraordinary revelations simply through his brilliant captions and picture headings. This was one of the Unique Selling Propositions (USP) of Resa and Silumina under his editorship. These incisive captions drew the reader to the (bigger) picture and the story.
Chamara was a repository of knowledge on politics, arts and sports, in no particular order. He had a remarkable memory for people, places and events, a fact that was not lost on his fellow journalists. He could describe historical incidents in detail without missing a beat. This surprised even many academics well versed in these subjects. He was not an avid note taker at press events, but when it came writing the story, he could often write from memory before the other journalists did. He had many plans to further develop Silumina and Resa newspapers.
Chamara will be missed by all at Lake House and other media houses. It will not be easy to find a replacement for Chamara, a man of many abilities. Chamara is survived by his wife Dinupa Dilhani and their son.

CIABOC is not a political tool - DG
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC) cannot be a tool in the hands of the political system. We need systems in place to make it work regardless of party or politics, said CIABOC Director General (DG) Sarath Jayamanne.
Addressing a gathering of media and civil society on the formulation of a National Action Plan to Eliminate Bribery and Corruption at the Movenpick Hotel on Monday, Jayamanne explained that complaints of bribery and corruption usually were only made soon after a regime change took place.
It is then that people remember all the large-scale corruption. Then the public starts to view the Commission as a tool in the political system of the country. People have been asking me if the Commission is only used for politicians on either side to bring down their political opponents.
The DG pointed out that apart from complaints, no politician has come forward to speak of establishing systems or legislation which would prevent and deter corruption.
He said the Bribery Act had not been amended in the last 30 years, the Asset Declaration Act was outdated, and laws on conflict of interest and gift rules were yet to be legislated. Current asset declaration laws also only require the person to declare their assets on March 31 of every year and do not show the transactions of that year. Further, there is no institution to collect the declarations or review them to ascertain their credibility.
We cant undertake investigations in accordance with the political machinery of the country. Investigations cannot only be done when regimes change. We need a system that is beyond this. Chasing after wrongdoers after a crime is committed is just one method. Another method is to introduce legislature that will deter crime, said the DG.
The Commission is to hire 50 new officers, some of them graduates, for the first time in the Commissions history, to set up a Prevention Unit and the National Action Plan which is to be finalised in the next three months will look at ways to deter corruption at every level of society. More importantly, they will target children in teaching them the importance of living a life of integrity, Jayamanne said.
He said Hong Kong has agreed to train CIABOC officers in preventive legislation. If we can deter corruption, people will not keep asking when we are going to arrest the corrupt. We will be able to nip it in the bud.

Ciaboc says 25% public officials are corrupt
Surveys done on the public sector by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) had revealed that 25 percent of public sector officials are corrupt.
CIABOC Commissioner Neville Guruge addressing the media and civil society members at an event held at Movenpick Hotel, on Monday (2) night said the remaining 75 percent were clean but their voices were drowned by the 25 percent, They have been cornered, the clean have not been given a place in the public sector, he said.
The event was held to gather views of the media and civil society members on the drafting of a National Action Plan to Eliminate Bribery and Corruption.The proposal to formulate one received Cabinet approval recently and the CIABOC stated that they expected to prepare one within the next three months.
We also see that in any institution where there is rampant corruption, there are weaknesses in the leadership.If the head does not lead by example, if he or she is not strict about curbing it in their respective institutions, the situation is bad, Guruge said.
He further explained that of the 25 percent who are corrupt, 15 percent can be reformed, but the remaining 10 percent were so entrenched in such practices that only legal action worked, This 10 percent does not want to change, they are not interested. Legal action must be taken against them. Honesty is not only refraining from taking bribes. It is a wide subject. If someone is taking a salary but is not working, he is shirking his responsibilities.Simply coming to work on time and leaving early having done nothing is also being dishonest.
The CIABOC which is expected to focus on awareness and preventive methods to curb bribery and corruption, said they have launched several programmes in schools to mould the mindsets of children. Integrity clubs have been planned in schools to instill values of integrity and honesty, We have to start from the beginning. Otherwise we will also lose the next generation to this menace, Guruge said.

Geda - The monkey
This Chinese monkey, apart from predicting winners of multiple World Cup matches in 2010, also predicted Donald Trumps presidency. He was asked to pick between two bananas placed beside life-sized cut-outs of Trump and Hillary Clinton. After much contemplation, the mystic monkey chose Trump, and even planted a wet kiss on his cardboard likeliness.

Dirty Harry - The crocodile
Harry, a saltwater crocodile living in Australia, correctly predicted that Julia Gillard would become the prime minister in 2010. He also predicted that Spain would win the 2010 World Cup, beating the Netherlands in the finals. Harrys prediction method involved choosing between two suspended chickens, each of which had photos or flags attached to it.

## Title: Compilation of GDP complies with international standards: DCS
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, July 4, 2018 - 01:00
Compilation of GDP complies with international standards: DCS
The following is a clarification issued by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) on certain matters related to the compilation and revision of National Account Estimates.
National Account Estimates are compiled by the DCS quarterly and annually, with a time lag of 75 days. National Accounts Statistics compiled by the DCS includes Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by production, Income and Expenditures approaches, Gross National Income, Gross National Disposable Income, and Gross Savings.
National Accounts Base Year
The National Accounts base year is the year used as the base period for constant price calculations in the countrys National Accounts. It is recommended that the base year of constant price estimates be changed periodically to reflect changes in the economic structure and relative prices and this process is commonly known as rebasing.
Need to revise base year
Rebasing of the National Accounts series is the process of replacing an old base year used to compile GDP at constant prices with a new and more recent base year or price structure. Economies are dynamic in nature: they grow, shrink, new economic activities emerge, new technologies are used, and consumer behaviour and preferences change over time. Rebasing is used to capture these changes so as to give an accurate picture of an economy.
Most recent round of rebasing
In the history of compiling National Account Estimates of Sri Lanka, the base year had been revised to years 1958, 1963, 1975, 1990, 1998 and 2002. Rebasing is an extensive exercise and needs a few years to complete as it involves several activities including inclusion of emerging economic activities, making data available through new surveys, censuses, and administrative records, etc. In 2011, the work related to moving the base year from 2002 to 2010 with technical assistance from international agencies including the Asian Development Bank and International Monitory Fund commenced. Rebasing activities were completed by the end of 2014. Releasing National Account Estimates with respect to the new base year 2010 commenced from the first quarter of 2015. Since then, the base year for National Accounts released by the DCS is 2010.
Revision of published National Accounts Estimates
For compiling National Account Estimates, data is needed from a broad spectrum, through various sources covering all the economic activities of the country. For instance, in each quarter, administrative data are collected from about 250 organisations. Apart from that, data are also collected through, censuses, surveys, administrative reports, annual reports, research reports, etc. However, there are instances where the required data are not available at the time of releasing the National Accounts Estimates. For certain economic activities, it takes a year or more to obtain the finalised data required for calculation of National Account Estimates.
For example, there are two paddy cultivation seasons in our country - Maha and Yala. Harvesting of the Maha and Yala seasons takes place from February to April and August to September respectively. However, the sowing periods of the Maha and Yala seasons span from September to March and April to August respectively. The value added of rice growing is estimated and used in the respective quarters in GDP Estimates as final production statistics are not available for the respective quarters. Final real output or production data will only be available when the harvesting is over in the entire country. Only the final quarterly and annual value added of the rice growing sub-economic activity can be calculated in the respective quarters.
Accordingly, provisional data are used for some economic activities in compiling National Account Estimates. Therefore, the National Accounts Estimates already released need to be updated or revised for no reason other than the final data becoming available. If not revised, the true scenario of the economy may not be captured correctly.
Revising GDP estimates is an internationally recommended practice and is being practised in many countries. National Accounts Estimates cannot be analysed in the future if final National Account Estimates are calculated and recorded when the final data become available.
Revision policy
As per International National Accounts Guidelines and like many other National Accounts compiling countries, DCS introduced a revision policy for Sri Lanka during the last rebasing exercise, which was published in the second quarter of 2015. According to this published revision policy, the National Account Estimates issued for a particular quarter or year can continue to be revised as explained below.
According to the revision policy of National Account Estimates, provisional estimates are prepared and published 75 days after the respective quarter. These estimates are based on quick estimates or provisional data obtained from different sources. Similarly, in 75 days after completing a year, annual estimates and fourth quarter estimates are released with the revised estimates for the first three quarters of the same year and for the previous two years. These estimates are known as revised provisional estimates. After receiving the final data for the year, final Quarterly and Annual National Accounts Estimates are released. All the revisions are published in the Revision Triangle, under the National Accounts section of the DCS website.
Many countries which prepare National Account Estimates in a proper manner use a revision policy for compilation and publishing of National Account Estimates. For example, according to the National Accounts revision policy of the United States of America (USA), there are provisions to revise the GDP estimates even up to 20 times each quarter per year. USA and Great Britain and almost all other European countries follow similar revision policies.
Revision of GDP and updating growth rate
In general, the economic growth rate is the rate at which a nations GDP changes or grows from one year to another. Similarly, economic growth rate of a quarter is calculated as the percentage change of the real GDP of a quarter compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Therefore, it is clear that the revision of GDP of a quarter or a year leads to updating the corresponding growth rates.
For example, the published provisional estimate of real GDP for the first quarter of 2017 was Rs. 2,161,770 million. As per the revision policy, by now it has been revised four times. The estimated GDP of the first quarter of 2017 at the first, second, third and fourth revisions were Rs. 2,161,735 million, Rs. 2,164,747 million, Rs. 2,154,971 million and Rs. 2,155,247 million respectively. These revisions were done on June 15, 2017, September 15, 2017, December 15, 2017, March 20, 20180 and June 18, 2018, respectively. According to these revisions of GDP, the growth rate of the first quarter of 2017 was revised as 3.8, 3.8, 3.95, 3.35, and 3.37 respectively on the above dates. (The GDP of the first quarter of 2016 was also revised several times for reasons explained above.)
The latest estimated growth rate for the first quarter of 2018 (released on June 18, 2018) was 3.2 as the percentage change from the most recent GDP estimates of the first quarter of 2017 of Rs. 2,155,247 million to Rs. 2,223,856 million, that of first quarter of 2018. In calculating growth rates, most recent estimates of real GDP of both years should be used and not revised values of previous rounds.
Compiling estimates using data from two base year periods
No National Accounts Estimate can be compiled using data under the base year 2010 and data under the previous base year periods together. The main reason for this is that during the last base year revision, parallel to moving the base year from 2002 to 2010, a number of improvements for the National account compilation process were introduced. Those improvements include methodological changes, coverage expansion of production boundary, adaptation to latest classifications and SNA  2008.
GDP deflator
By complying with internationally recommended procedures, GDP is calculated at nominal (current) and real (constant) prices. After compilation of GDP, a number of macro-economic indicators are prepared. One of the very important such indicators is the GDP implicit price deflator which is a measure of the level of prices of all new domestically produced final goods and services in an economy. The GDP implicit price deflator considers all the economic activities of the entire economy and serves the purpose of measuring inflation of the country. This is one of the indicators used to measure the changes in the price levels of finished goods and services at a particular period of time.
The GDP deflator is calculated by dividing Nominal (current) GDP by Real (constant) GDP. Accordingly, the GDP deflator is compiled after compiling GDP, but not the other way around.
Impact of revision of GDP on GDP deflator
Obviously as the GDP is revised as per the Revision Policy of National Accounts, the GDP implicit price deflator too get revised since the GDP deflator is the rate calculated by dividing nominal GDP by real GDP. Therefore, the GDP implicit price deflator is a byproduct of the National Accounts compilation process. Before compiling the GDP deflator, thousands of calculations need to be done in a number of worksheets to compile GDP Estimates. Therefore, it is almost impossible to carry out backward calculations to obtain GDP with pre-decided GDP deflators, and it is not an internationally accepted practice of estimating National Accounts Statistics.
Publishing National Accounts Estimates
All National Account Estimates compiled by the DCS, including all revisions, are published in the DCS website - www.statistics.gov.lk. These numbers are quoted and published by some other institutions in their publications. However, estimates published in their publications may not necessarily be the most recent revisions. Therefore, it is recommended to use the DCS website to obtain the most recent statistics.
Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI)
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an indicator that measures the weighted average of market prices of a selected basket of consumer goods and services. The CCPI is calculated and published monthly by the DCS, on the last working day of the month. It is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them. Market prices, not provisional prices of these goods and services are collected from 14 selected markets in the urban areas of Colombo District to calculate the CCPI through a price survey. Therefore, there is no need to revise the published Colombo Consumer Price Index as the prices used were actual prices. Contrary to this, GDP estimates need to be revised as the value added of certain sub-economic activities is estimated using provisional data.

Federer, Serena breeze through Wimbledon furnace
LONDON, Monday: Eight-time champion Roger Federer and seven-time winner Serena Williams shrugged off 30-degree heat to breeze into the Wimbledon second round Monday.
Federer, the defending champion and seeking a 21st major, marked the start of his 20th successive Wimbledon with a new look and a comfortable 6-1, 6-3, 6-4 win over Serbia's Dusan Lajovic.
Williams, like Federer, 36-years-old but chasing a 24th Slam title, enjoyed a hard-fought 7-5, 6-3 victory over Holland's Arantxa Rus.
It was the American's first match at the All England Club since lifting the 2016 title.
She missed the 2017 edition as she prepared for the birth of her first child.
Top seed Federer marched out on Centre Court dressed for the first time in gear designed by Japanese giant Uniqlo in a deal reported to be worth $300 million after a two-decade association with Nike.
But everything else was familiar for the Swiss star who cruised past world number 57 Lajovic in just 79 minutes.
It was the second successive year that Federer had knocked out the Serb at Wimbledon. "I'm very happy, I felt good from the start too which was nice and that was not the case last year against him. I remember I struggled early on a lot," said Federer.
After just 20 minutes to complete the first set, Federer went on to fire 35 winners past Lajovic, breaking serve five times, setting up a second round encounter against Lukas Lacko of Slovakia.
Out on Court One, Serena, seeded 25 this year despite a ranking of 181, had too much power for Rus, the world 107.
Williams, looking to move within one title of Martina Navratilova's Open era record of nine Wimbledon titles, fired 23 winners past Rus.
Victory was sealed on a fifth match point and next faces Bulgarian qualifier Viktoriya Tomova.
"I don't know if I'm relieved, more motivated, but I am happy to get through that," said Williams, whose return to Slam tennis after pregnancy at Roland Garros last month ended in a fourth round injury withdrawal.
US Open champion and fourth seed Sloane Stephens became the tournament's first big name casualty when she slumped to a 6-1, 6-3 loss to Croatia's world 55 Donna Vekic.For Stephens, fresh from making the French Open final last month, it was her second successive first round loss at the tournament.
"There isn't too much I can do -- I'm not going to go and cry. Life goes on," said Stephens, who was followed out of the tournament by Bulgarian sixth seed Grigor Dimitrov.
The 2014 semi-finalist was stunned by three-time Slam winner Stan Wawrinka 1-6, 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/5), 6-4.
Wawrinka, whose ranking has slumped to 225 after knee surgery, had lost his last four matches against Dimitrov.
But at the same tournament where he played what proved to be his last match of 2017, the 33-year-old was rejuvenated.
"It's a great feeling to win like this on Centre Court," said Wawrinka, twice a quarter-finalist at Wimbledon.
Also making a first round exit was Ukraine fifth seed Elina Svitolina, beaten 7-6 (7/3), 4-6, 6-1 by Germany's Tatjana Maria, the Mallorca grasscourt champion last week.
Third seed and 2017 runner-up Marin Cilic enjoyed a 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 win over Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka.
Second seed Caroline Wozniacki, who has never got to the quarter-finals at Wimbledon, built on her Eastbourne title at the weekend with a 59-minute, 6-0, 6-3 win over Varvara Lepchenko.
Venus Williams, a five-time champion and runner-up last year, made the next round with a 6-7 (3/7), 6-2, 6-1 win against Johanna Larsson of Sweden.
Serena's fellow tennis-playing mother, Victoria Azarenka, a former world number one and two-time semi-finalist, defeated Ekaterina Alexandrova of Russia 7-6 (7/4), 6-3.
Ivo Karlovic, 39 and the oldest man in the draw, made the second round by seeing off Mikhail Youzhny, just three years younger, 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (9/7), 6-3.
But Karlovic's Croatian compatriot Borna Coric, who defeated Federer for the Halle title last week, was a first round loser against Russia's Daniil Medvedev 7-6 (8/6), 6-2, 6-2.
Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska, the 2012 runner-up, then supplied the late night drama, saving six match points to beat Romanian qualifier Elena-Gabriela Ruse 6-3, 4-6, 7-5.  AFP

Finch revels in record as Australia smash Zimbabwe
HARARE:Australia captain Aaron Finch revelled in his record-breaking innings against Zimbabwe, saying it was up there as one of the best innings he has ever played.
Finch powered his way to 172, beating his own world record high score in Twenty20 Internationals.
Finch and fellow opener DArcy Short put on 223, another world record.
Australia reached 229 for two, the highest total ever scored against Zimbabwe in a T20 international as a slew of records were broken during Australias 100-run victory.
Its nice to break my own record, said Finch. Satisfying. Its something that Ill look back on when Ive finished playing and be really proud of. Finch cracked his first six in the fourth over of the morning, and with his third he brought up a 22-ball half century - his fastest in Twenty20 internationals.
Australia took 75 from the Powerplay, with Finch doing the bulk of the scoring while fellow opener DArcy Short was content to turn the strike over to his big-hitting partner.
Finch brought up his second T20I hundred at the end of the 14th over, taking just 50 deliveries. AFP

Fitch rates Commercial Bank of Ceylons Basel III Sub Debt Final AA-(lka)
Fitch Ratings has assigned Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLCs (CB, AA(lka)/Stable) proposed Basel III-compliant subordinated unsecured debentures a final National Long-Term Rating of AA-(lka).
The final rating is the same as the expected rating assigned on February 14, 2018 and follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received.
The debentures, totalling Rs10 billion, have maturities of five and 10 years, carry fixed coupons and will be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. The notes include a non-viability clause and will qualify as regulatory Tier 2 capital for the bank. The bank plans to use the proceeds to strengthen its Tier 2 capital base and support its loan book expansion.
Fitch rates the Basel III Tier 2 notes one notch below the banks National Long-Term Rating of AA(lka) to reflect the notes higher loss-severity risks compared with senior unsecured instruments due to their subordinated status and higher loss-severity risks relative to senior unsecured instruments.
The notes would convert to equity upon the occurrence of a trigger event, as determined by the Monetary Board of Sri Lanka.
CBs National Long-Term Rating is used as the anchor rating because it reflects the banks standalone financial strength. Fitch believes the banks standalone credit profile best indicates the risk of non-viability.
Fitch has not differentiated the notching on the notes from the notching on CBs legacy Tier 2 notes, as it is assumed that the authorities would step in late, moving the point of non-viability close to liquidation.
Fitch has not applied additional notching to the notes for non-performance risk, according to our criteria, as the notes have no going-concern loss-absorption features.
The rating of the notes will move in tandem with CBs National Long-Term Rating.

Foreign exchange reaches Rs. 92.117 bn during past 21 months
After the European Union (EU) lifted the ban imposed on fish imports from Sri Lanka, the country had earned foreign exchange valued at Rs. 92.117 billion during the past 21 months. It was achieved through the exportation of 58.578 kilotonnes of fish.
The ban, which was imposed in 2015 due to local produce failing to meet the standards of the EU, was lifted in 2016 following discussions conducted between the union and President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. In 2014, fish exports reached 26.320 kilotonnes and while the ban was effective, that is, the 18-month period from January 2015 to June 2016, 26.129 kilotonnes of fish were exported, earning foreign exchange valued at Rs. 2.103 billion.
According to information received from the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Ministry, following the ban, a large number of fish-processing industries were closed down.

Former Malaysian PM Najib arrested
Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was arrested by anti-corruption investigators on Tuesday afternoon in a development likely to lead to the former leaders charging with corruption offences.
A source with knowledge of the inquiry into Najib said that investigators had arranged for the former PM to hand himself into the anti-corruption agency on Tuesday.
Last month, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said authorities were seeking to bring embezzlement and bribery charges against Najib after an inquiry into the suspected theft of billions of dollars from the state-run fund 1MDB.
US Department of Justice civil lawsuits are seeking to seize $US1.7 billion in real estate, art works and other luxuries allegedly bought with money looted from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) state fund, over which Najib exercised significant control .

Gentlemen put to shame
The recent event of ball tampering by the captain of the team is indeed a disgrace to the country. The gentlemen's game introduced by the British provided recreation to the players and entertainment for the public.
With the increasing sponsorships and millions of rupees changing hands the game has been degraded. Politicians now rule the roost. Greed pervades the scene as rogues enter the arena. The worst effect is the shame inflicted on the country with the noble game reduced to disaster as the humbugs rule the roost.
The Cricket Board encroached by opportunists is controlled by a gang of rogues and their proxies who manipulate the Board. Due to the manipulators being politicians in power it is utilized to mask the wrong doings. Heavy money buys votes as cricket clubs and associations are organised by these crooks to cover up the misdeeds. In order to end these manipulations it is sad but necessary to take sterner action by withdrawing some of the perks and companies cutting down sponsorships. It will be unfortunate but now very necessary to set in motion strict regulations including that of imposing life bans on the players and officials who are proven guilty.
The country is undergoing severe strain and shame by acts of match fixing, ball tampering, pitch tampering and God knows what not. Sri Lankans will be scorned by the whole world and labelled as a bunch of crooks! Do we need such a label

A gift for special  educators
Handunaganna Ma (Sarasavi 2018) denoting a wide interpretation that goes as Identify Me as written by Rohana Deva Perera encompasses a wide range of resource material on the subject of understanding the group of humans known as disabled or differently abled is skilled as a teacher and a researcher in the area of special education.
Rohana Deva tries to approach the subject from a creative understanding laying down medical and psychological material in the simplest possible manner. Rohana Deva and his wife, Ramani Damayanthi, have been instrumental in the founding of a school for the disabled young girls and boys over a period of three decades.
The school is known by the acronym: Thidora (Theatre Institute for Disability Oriented Research and Advocacy). Both of them had gained experiences at home and abroad in the field of creative communication with emphasis on disability-oriented individuals. They happened to learn quite a number of learning and teaching factors as taught at West London College of Theatre in Hammersmith and Amici Dance Theatre Group and in various other places.
Emphasis on disability
Having come to Sri Lanka, they managed to form their own theatre group laying more emphasis on disabled children. In this manner, I find that the husband and wife have quite a rich repository of material collected over the years that go into the making of a resourceful Sinhala booklet on the subject.
At the outset, the book triggers off with the opening chapter on the different forms of communication with a subtitle: Exchange of mutually understood symbols. The writer attempts to cover aspects of areas such as intrapersonal communication, interpersonal communication, group communication and mass communication. These areas help the reader, supposedly the teacher, with the opportunity of perceiving the fact that they lay embedded in human behaviour patterns.
Rohana Deva tries as far as possible to visualise the need to understand the behaviour patterns in order to proceed for the teaching for those known as individuals possessing physical and mental disorders.
Human communication
From here onwards, he embarks on the first step in special education titled as Sensory Motor Function. This concept is related as an extension of the human communication patterns as normally observed. He grades them into three groups that go as Sensory Registration (SR) Sensory Modulation (SM) and Sensory Integration (SI). Each of these areas is further interpreted by way of diagrams and examples drawn from behaviour.
A reader may not feel tired on the exemplification as they carry examples in the simplest possible clarity of expression. This leads to the understanding of the much-discussed syndrome known to the world of medicine as autism. Though many books have been written on the subject area, the explanations in the work are laid down as sensitive observational notes of a creative artiste.
In these findings, a number of types of autistic behaviour are underlined as additional findings. As a reader, I found that they look more like case studies on individuals kept over the years for research purpose. The chapter titled as attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) is an extension of the previous material treated from a different point of view.
These materials give way to the sensitive understanding of the need to pay attention to taboos and prohibitions laid down as donts and dos on the part of adults on the behaviour of small and adolescent in various families. Furthermore, a teacher of special education may have to pay heed to a child in a milder manner.
Handicapped individuals
The chapter titled Learning Disability underlines some of the salient points so far discovered in the field of mentally handicapped individuals. Retaining some of the social ethics, the learned writer goes on to explore the chief factors such as disability due to genetic inheritance.
A second factor is found as accidents occurred during the pregnancy of the mother. Then there are several other factors such as the undergrowth of a child since seeing the light of the day.
A child could be seen as possessing a good hearing and good seeing. Yet, he or she may not grow up mentally due to various other reasons yet to be discovered by researchers in the field. But the most important factor is determined as hidden or latent skills of a child since birth. This is the skill that should be discovered by the teacher of special education.
Followed by the explanation of the various types of mental retardation, the writer tries to explore the concept of the gifted child denoted as special skills possessed by the children when growing up stages. In order to clarify the meanings attributed the writer present several case studies, which the reader feels closer to come into groups with the subject. He states that some children could be discerned as gifted as a result of the questions they ask in order to develop their skills. In this direction, some are gifted of technology knowledge, some of painting, dancing and theatre arts.
Gifted children
Some become good imitators in the learning process. This is nothing but a gift. Some gifted children are seen becoming geniuses on growing, up to the adult stage of their lives. This factor is presented in the presentation of several profiles of persons such as Helen Keller, Einstein and Edison. Approaching the theatrical techniques such as teaching methods, the writer helps the reader to an exposition into the use of theatre arts such as therapy and the effect of dancing and music as amalgamated uses. All in all Handunaganna Ma is a text that could be recommended for general reading as well as a resource to the special education.

GMOA warming up again
The GMOA, after a brief silence, has once again jumped on its hobbyhorse of poking its fingers in matters that are well outside its remit. With the SAITM matter now losing steam, and, perhaps, buoyed by the eighth consecutive election victory of its President, Anurudhdha Padeniya, the GMOA may now want to open another flank against the government.
In this respect Padeniya himself has taken the lead. Soon after his victory, the GMOA President, among other things, stated that the Professional National Front (PNF), led by his organisation, would prepare an action plan, devoid of party politics, to draft a national trade policy for the country and immediately contradicts himself when he says that the GMOA would conduct a one-day workshop at the Bauddha Mandiraya on national policy to expose the government's bogus trade policy. After this statement does Padeniya expects any sane person to believe that he is not without political prejudices
Padeniya, it was, who, opposite the Fort Railway station, not so long ago, blasted the present government, singling out two ministers for special attack, during the height of the SAITM issue. He got so carried away with his attack on the government that he ventured to even cast aspersions on the courts for which he is now arraigned for contempt. How can the GMOA President take a dispassionate view on things, politically speaking, when he was seen in the front rows among the audience at one of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa's Professionals gatherings It is plain now that the GMOA is functioning as an appendage of the Joint Opposition and working overtime to re-enthrone the Rajapaksas. This was clearly seen during the special clinics set up by GMOA members for the recent flood victims, where the patients were examined to the accompaniment of the same musical strains that commonly accompanied Mahinda Rajapaksa's appearances at events, as seen on certain TV channels.
Padeniya and his GMOA are welcome to support a political party or a politician of their choice. Their members are also free to attend meetings and forums of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. They are also entitled to engage in trade union action over real or perceived grievances, even at the expense of the poor patients. But they should steer clear of matters that does not come under their purview. Dictating to the government how to run the economy or what trade policy it should follow is none of their business. The government, we are sure, have enough professionals and experts in this field. What makes Padeniya and his lot think that, they, as medical men, are also qualified to pontificate to the government on matters of trade
By-lateral and multi-lateral trade agreements are nothing new to this country. Similar trade pacts existed even under MR. Why such agreements did not warrant close scrutiny by the GMOA is understandable. Besides, no country can survive on its own in this day and age where the global village concept has brought about increased connectivity in trade and economic partnership. Padeniya and Co. cannot be ignorant of this. All that they are bent on is rocking the boat to facilitate the return of the Rajapaksas back to power.
This meddling has to stop. The authorities should tell this doctors trade union where to get off. Not stopping at trade, there is no knowing where the doctors campaign will end up. With major elections close at hand, the GMOA are sure to make inroads into other areas too, far removed from their calling. The massive war chest of the Rajapaksas, built over the years in power, could draw in other sectors too to cause disruption. Already schools are in ferment, with teachers threatening to go on strike, with a vernacular newspaper backing the Rajapaksas proclaiming in bold headlines that all schools will be closed today (04), a report that drew a sharp response from Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam. Crafty politicians will not care if they even have to drag schoolchildren onto the streets if that serves their narrow ends, as recent history shows. The government should be alert to all possibilities and contingency plans put in place.
Roy de Silva
We pen this words, albeit belatedly, to salute yet another stalwart of the Sinhala cinema who commenced his acting career in the sixties which is still hailed as the golden era of the Sinhala cinema, whose remains were laid to rest on Monday. Roy de Silva may not have been the glamour boy of the local silver screen. That appellation, no doubt, went to messrs Gamini Fonseka and Vijaya Kumaratunga. But Roy carved out his own niche and commanded a considerable fan club among the younger cinema goers of his day. Perhaps, he was the only actor, after the celebrated duo, who can be credited with box office hits. Films like Geetha and Sujeewa, as old timers may recall, ran to packed houses well exceeding 100 days screeing regarded as the benchmark to gauge the success of a film. With his passing goes the last of the stars that shone during the golden era of the Sinhala cinema.

As his melodies demanded more attention than any small segment of a song can address, they were crying for a separate feel and a texture only a dedicated instrumental song can do justice to. Songs such as Infinity, gods legend and before I die became instant hits.

Heart  beating with humanity

When some become leaders they tend to think of themselves as all-powerful. We tend to think that we are superior. If we cant soothe another person there is no point in becoming a leader. You should be able to make your followers good leaders,
Head Prefect of Princess of Wales Moratuwa, Shehara Isham believes that winning the hearts of people can have a very positive influence on society and make a huge difference in everyones lives. Perfect Prefects features Isham, who believes in touching hearts.
Isham believes that one form of love is the act of giving a future of stability and security to children. A Future where children can enjoy life. A future that they, in turn, can pass on to future generations.
A leader should always be focused on the welfare of the younger generation. A leader should embody the very characteristics the young should embody  humanity, kindness and love. This is so we can build a better tomorrow. This is what the youth should stand for. A leaders focus should always be this, said Isham.
Understanding the circumstances
Apart from natural disasters, many problems originate amongst humans. But more than winning conflicts winning hearts is important.
Dealing with humans is not like dealing with machines. Humans possess emotions. Understanding the circumstances they might be living in and understanding their hearts is important. We cant understand the circumstances a person comes from by judging by outer appearances. He or she might be facing a great difficulty or he or she might be in mental distress. I need to talk to that person carefully and accurately assess and understand the situation she is in. Leading people is not bossing them around. Leading is being friendly to a person and understanding them, explained Isham.
Becoming Head Girl was not unexpected for Isham. However, she has always had a genuine desire to help the school that has given her so much and be a role model to children.
I really believe in loving people. This is evident from what I say and do. I have always maintained cordial relationships with my fellow students. Being obedient to the teachers and staff have also been a priority of mine. I have also given equal importance in educating myself in addition to my extracurricular activities. I enjoy reading poetry and reading novels and watching movies that won Cannes or Oscars, stated Isham.
Isham has been to other schools but Princess of Wales is where she found her true family.
Special bond
Princess of Wales is where I settled down at. It is celebrating 142 years of existence. This is where I found myself. I have a special bond with this school. From day one I was guided by my teachers. I have been taught proper moral values through my school and I have also learnt to be good and kind. Everything has been given to me by my school.
It has moulded my character in many ways. It has really empowered me. Even though I have been reprimanded, I have always been reminded that I am loved. I have learnt leadership qualities from my school, pointed out Isham.
Amongst the leaders she admires is Dr Martin Luther King. Kings compassionate leadership has made quite an impression on Isham.
He brought people together and that was something that was really hard to do. He had this special quality within him that enabled him to bring people together, said Isham.
Ishams ambition in life is to become an oncologist. She is currently doing bioscience and would like to pursue higher studies at Otago and Harvard.
Biggest change
I understand that cancer patients are in distress and that really hits me hard. If I can fulfil my dream of being an oncologist, I am willing to help those who are too poor to pay for their treatment, said Isham.
Isham believes that 7 billion hearts beating together can create the biggest change in this world. It is a force that cannot be underestimated.
Though we as individuals differ from each other, I believe in being compassionate and influencing those around me, effecting change for the greater good. There are 7 billion hearts in this world but there are only a few that beat into others. We have to become a society that wants to help others. People need to live in the real world without living in a dream world.
We need to be down to earth. Poverty, Diseases and Mental Stress are issues that concern me the most in this world.
When a person is undergoing mental stress he or she should be helped out. I really feel for them, explained Isham.
Leadership is more than leading from the front with bravery, intelligence and a bit of luck. Sometimes you need to be able to heal.
When some become leaders they tend to think of themselves as all-powerful. We tend to think that we are superior. If we cant soothe another person there is no point in becoming a leader. You should be able to make your followers good leaders, said Isham.
Becoming Head Girl will be a day that will always remain special to her and of course school is the place she loves the most. As Head Girl, I have a lot of responsibilities. Pressure can come from many areas of my life. But as an individual, I have always kept away from doing wrong- harming someone else or lying. Knowing that my intentions are noble, I handle the pressure that way, said Isham.

LHD offers world-class standards in laboratory testing
Whether as a preventive measure or to facilitate treatment, diagnosis forms the cornerstone of every medical procedure. Situated on the 7th floor of Lanka Hospitals, Lanka Hospitals Diagnostics (LHD) sets the record of being Sri Lankas first-ever medical reference laboratory. Equipped with the best ultramodern medical equipment, LHD explicitly fulfills the growing need for the most accurate and reliable medical testing procedures. A fully owned subsidiary of Lanka Hospitals Corporation PLC, LHD now showcases a portfolio of over 1,100 lab assessments, including a large number of exclusive tests currently not available elsewhere in the country.
The vacuum that existed in the market for internationally accredited reference laboratory testing was evident when Sri Lankans travel overseas to get their tests done, spending large sums of money, stated Chief Executive Officer of LHD, Pradeep Edward. Upon its launch in 2014, LHD was foremost in identifying the need to have high quality diagnostics in this country. Apart from tens of thousands of locals who patronize our services, we see a multitude of foreign patients especially from the Maldives and Seychelles along with expats who now frequent our Lab services he further added.
The resounding success of LHD is also attributed to its global accreditation standards. LHD set the benchmark for supreme quality by stepping up to the gold standards of the laboratory accreditation program certified by the College of American Pathologists (CAP). This international accreditation has given LHD its prestigious standing as the only CAP-accredited laboratory in the country.
A comprehensive quality management procedure with a regular proficiency testing (PT) program spanning over a 6-month period was advocated within LHD by CAP prior to granting the said accreditation in 2017. The process involved the most scientifically customized checklist, inclusive of regular testing of samples for the entire range of patient diagnostics. Furthermore, the layout of the laboratory, quality of equipment, reagents, qualification of staff were extensively monitored along with all documentation and processes.
With CAP accreditation, LHD has experienced a leap in Turnaround Time (TAT) with higher accuracy in test results; a process which is also made viable due to our high standards of technology and machinery made to meet European and CAP benchmarks Edward reiterated. In order to serve the Sri Lankan population better, LHD opened up regional laboratories in Kandy, Wellawatta and Negombo. With several more regional and mini labs in the pipeline, LHD has also spread its wings offshore to Seychelles, with plans underway to expand to the Maldives in the near future.

Low cost method for Provincial Council elections
It is reported in the press that notwithstanding a difference of opinion that has arisen at a party leaders meeting regarding the forthcoming Provincial Council (PC) elections, it has been decided to revert to the Preference Voting (PV) system. It is tantamount to a patent reversal of the much avowed Election promise given by all political parties at the last Presidential and General elections. Pertinent it is, to note that the main plank of the late Ven. Sobhitha Theras campaign was the abolition of the despicable PV system.
Whither Electoral Reforms
The writer has submitted a comprehensive package of proposals on Electoral reforms several times during the recent past through the press with copies to Public Committee on Constitutional reforms, Constitutional Assembly, Election Commission, Presidents office, PMs office, a few concerned Party offices, Civil Organizations and individuals. The package addressed several important national imperatives triggering from our emerging political culture, which were not adequately dealt with even under the Mixed Voting system which went in to disarray due to several reasons.
A simple method
Since the issue at hand is the PC elections I quote below the relevant extract from my package of proposals.
Wasteful and unproductive electoral system to be replaced by simple, cost and time saving electoral reforms such as, substituting Preference Voting system with District wise party merit lists carrying names of political professionals selected under robust eligibility criteria leading to avoidance of Bi-elections, Hung-Parliament and Cross-overs et al.
Under the proposed system, the number of seats won by each contesting party will be determined by applying proportionate arithmetic to the total number of seats allocated to each District in a Province by the Elections Commission. This will ensure that every single valid vote will carry an equal value epitomizing the basic tenet of a liberal democracy.
Key success factor
The key success factor of this proposal as mentioned above is based on proper identification and selection of candidates in merit order by the contesting parties against a set of eligibility criteria laid down by the Election Commission in consultation with voters organisations such as Paffrel and Caffe. The first step in this direction was taken by Paffrel in the form of March 12th Declaration at the last elections. Now it is only a matter of improving on those criteria and regularizing them as specific eligibility criteria for all candidates. In this regard, a Citizens wish list by the writer titled Criteria for selecting election candidates was also published by the press and copies were sent to the concerned organizations.
Accordingly, the contesting parties will be required to establish and execute a robust, transparent and structured interview procedure to select their candidates in merit order for each District so that the oft repeated claim that the party leader will select his henchaiyas can be avoided.
Additional advantages
Readers will appreciate that in addition to benefits arising from the removal of PV system, the following key advantages will accrue to the candidates, system and the country at large.
1) Simplification of the work-load of the Elections Dept. paving the way for Election results to be announced before mid-night resulting in a tremendous saving of time, manpower and money.
2) Since the selection of candidates in merit order is fully entrusted to the parties concerned, the campaign funds will have to be channeled through the Party in a transparent manner and the candidates will be prevented from raising funds for their individual campaigns thereby absolving them from undue allegations of bribery and corruption as alleged in the infamous list of 118!
3) The Election Commission will find it easy to monitor the campaign expenditure of parties than of individuals.
The above proposals constitute a Model of our own anvil with Social equality, Justice, simplicity and passion for high productivity forming its Boiler-Plates. Therefore, looking for examples from other countries is superfluous.
We appeal to all sensible citizens, academics, politicians and civil activists to carefully study the above proposal with an open mind and persuade the authorities to stop breeding more unprofessional politicians draining the resources of our country already burdened with a colossal debt portfolio and low productivity.

LTTE raising its head once again:JO
Joint Opposition members speaking to the media after Parliament was adjourned due to the protest staged by them, passed the blame on the incident to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
In a hurriedly convened press conference at the Parliament complex, they alleged that Speaker Jayasuriya shirked his duties.
JO MP Keheliya Rambukwella said that former President JR Jayewardene introduced the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution to prevent MPs promoting separatism and now a UNP MP had done so violating the Constitution. We hoped that there would be no more LTTE after 2009. But the LTTE is raising its head again after 2015. State Minister Maheswaran made that statement in the presence of Foreign Minister and the Home Affairs Minister. Such statements go to the international community too. Maheswaran acted in a manner violating the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution. The Speaker should have conducted an investigation on the statement. We staged a protest because the Speaker failed in his duty. We demanded two minutes of Parliament time to condemn that statement by the State Minister. The Speaker did not give us that time. He should accept full responsibility for what happened in Parliament today, he stated.
MPs Prasanna Ranaweera, Ranjith de Zoysa and Padma Udayashantha Gunasekera also addressed the Press conference.

Maithri Panagoda conferred with  Order of Australia
Lyrical lawyer
Since leaving Sri Lanka in 1975, he spent all my energy in raising a family and building a career in law. It was not an easy task, first in England, and then in Australia. He neglected what he enjoyed most as a teenager, creative writing. By the time the children had grown up, and he had managed to find his place in the world, he was in his late fifties. He wanted to get back into creative writing but felt that he had left it for too long. His Sinhalese vocabulary was almost empty. I had difficulty in expressing in poetic Sinhala the thoughts and feelings that came to mind. It was a frustrating experience and I was ashamed of myself. However, my determination was stronger than my ability at that time, muses Maithri Panagoda, who teaches law as an adjunct professor at the University of Notre Dame in Sydney. Panagoda is also one of the few Lankan born Australians bestowed with Australia's Highest Award Order for Citizens and Professionals.
His poetry collection titled Hada Mumunana Handa and CDs titled Mahamera Se and La Hiru Res will be launched at Sri Lanka Foundation Institute on July 11 at 4 pm. Saman Athavudahetti will compere the event while Tillakaratne Kuruvitabandara and Sunil Sarath Perera will deliver the speeches. The vocalists who will sing Panagodas lyrics include Professor Sanath Nandasiri, Jagath Wickramasinghe, Rohana Siriwardana, Chamika Sirimanna and Sachintha Panagoda.
Q: You have been writing and publishing poetry and lyrics since the 1970s. Some of your early lyrics have been sung by prominent Sri Lankan artists such as late Maestro Amaradeva, and Pandith Sanath Nandasiri. Some of your lyrics/songs with patriotic themes were playing in the SLBC's morning show in the 70s. Then why did you leave your native country and settled down in Australia, and why Australia and why not UK where you had your postgraduate work or USA
A: I entered Colombo University in 1969. During my undergraduate days, I used to contribute to Sinhalese Sunday newspapers and various magazines. I took part in radio programmes. I was among the young crowd that responded to the appeal for patriotic lyrics that came from the SLBC. I was fortunate that late Premasiri Khemadasa, the musical genius took a liking to my lyrics and arranged for young artists such as TM Jayarathna, Visharada Neela Wickramasinghe, HR Jothipala, Niranjala Sarojini, late Abeywardene Balasuriya to sing my songs. Although I studied law and was admitted to practise law in Sri Lanka, my ambition was to be a journalist. It was to follow a course in Journalism that I left for England in 1975. However, the realities of life meant that I was destined to be a lawyer first and a writer second.
Q: Since you settled down in Australia I understand that you have been heavily involved and continued your lyric-writing in addition to your contribution to community work in Sydney. Could you provide information on some of your work with the Sri Lankan community in Sydney
A: After six years in England, during which time I learnt the facts of life the hard way, and collected postgraduate qualifications and experience, entered married life and welcomed a baby son, I migrated to Australia in 1981. I worked as a lawyer for indigenous Australians which taught me a lot about the inherent unfairness in the legal system, racism, and the need to do more for the disadvantaged and marginalised members of the society. I was also privileged to be able to serve the Sri Lankan community in New South Wales.
Q: Why are you still writing in Sinhala and how do you find time as you are a very busy legal professional
A: I believe that I have gained "lost ground" and that I am almost back to where I would be had I not taken a break from writing following my departure from Sri Lanka in 1975. However, time remains my biggest obstacle in getting back into serious writing. My natural inclination is to write poetry and songs in Sinhalese. However, I have started jotting down some autobiographical notes in English. I do want to attempt to engage in creative writing in English at some future time.
Q: Perth-based poet Sunil Govinnage opines that you are one of most successful Sri Lankan domiciled in Australia. Plus, you are one of the few Sri Lankan born Australians bestowed with Australia's Highest Award Order for Citizens and Professionals. In which areas of work have you contributed to Australian society Do you have a plan to serve either literary or community work in Sri Lanka
A: I guess success is a matter of opinion and a subjective point of view. I am happy about my work in the legal field in Australia. I have had the privilege of being involved in some landmark cases. I was probably in the right place at the right time. I have every intention to continue my work in Australia while trying to spend more time in Sri Lanka.
Q: I understand that Sydney is the most vibrant Sri Lankan cultural centres compared to other States and Territories. It is home to well-known and talented writes such as Yasmine Goonaratne, Sunil Govinnage, Palitha Ganewatta, Laxman Koddituwakku, Saman Dissanayake and Michelle de Kretser writing and publishing in Sinhala and English from Sydney. Would you please share your thoughts on the literary activities in Sydney
A: Melbourne is a place of high volume Sri Lankan cultural activities. Other states produce a sprinkle of creative from Sri Lankan expats. Sunil Govinnage from Perth is a giant among us minions. I think he has produced more publications than any other Sri Lankan living in Australia. Sydney has a number of notable writers who are a better-organised group. The Writers Guild is an active group who meet regularly and make a significant contribution to the maintaining and harnessing of the available talent pool.
Q: Do you think that both Sri Lankan and Australian governments should look into the cultural exchange programs through a formal policy benefiting both countries
A: This is an issue that needs to be taken up at ministerial and diplomatic levels in the two countries. It will definitely be beneficial to the expats, their children and of course the writers living in Sri Lanka.
Q: What are your literary plans or work in progress
A: I am still a practising lawyer and there are constraints in my time. On the plus side, my children have grown up and my family responsibilities are much less. While experiencing the joy of spending time with my four grandchildren, I intend to attempt at some serious writing in both languages. I have had the privilege of representing litigants in some landmark Australian cases. The Kuru V State of NSW is one such case that went all the way to the High Court (which is the highest court in Australia, similar to the Supreme Court in Sri Lanka). I represented a person who was a victim of police brutality. We were successful and the client received a substantial amount of damages/compensation. The case is being studied in law schools and it defines certain police powers in the State of New South Wales. I have also represented indigenous people in a number of deaths in custody matters. The most significant area is Stolen Generation Litigation where I have successfully represented over 200 Aboriginal people. This has never been achieved in Australia before.

Martinez hails Belgium character after stunning World Cup win
ROSTOV-ON-DON, Russia, Monday: Belgium coach Roberto Martinez said he was deeply proud after his team hit back from 2-0 down to beat Japan and claim a place in the World Cup quarter-finals.
Substitute Nacer Chadli slotted home in the fourth minute of injury time to complete a memorable comeback and seal a 3-2 win in the last-16 match in Rostov-on-Don.
Belgium were stunned after Genki Haraguchi and Takashi Inui gave Japan a two-goal advantage early in the second half.
But Jan Vertonghen and Marouane Fellaini pulled them level and Chadlis winner means they will play Brazil in the last eight.
That was a test for the team and its character, said Martinez after Belgium become the first team in 48 years to overturn a 2-0 deficit in a World Cup knockout match.
We survived it, we have gone through and that is the most important thing.
No negatives today, it was about getting through, Martinez added. It is a day to be very proud of these players. Keep believing in Belgium.
In the World Cup you want to be perfect but its about getting through, its about winning.
I couldnt be prouder of them and everyone in Belgium needs to be proud of these players.
Martinez, the former Everton manager, also said Japan deserved credit for presenting his team with such a tough test.
Lets congratulate Japan, they played the perfect game. They were clinical on the counter and so solid, said the Belgium boss.
It was a test of character and you see the reaction of our subs coming on to win the game. It tells you everything about this group of players.
Physically, we finished the game really strong, the third goal was almost a powerful counter attack which saw us cover the pitch in six seconds.
The Spaniard denied under-estimating Japan after his side went 2-0 down early in the second-half.
We didnt underestimate them, we gave the players a lot of details about what Japan could do, said Martinez.
Their first goal was a fantastic counter attack and the second one was a wonder strike from them down to brilliance.
Mentally we had to be very strong, I felt the players always had the belief, but we never underestimated Japan.
Martinez singled out Romelu Lukaku for praise in the build-up to the winning goal after the Manchester United striker let the ball roll to the unmarked Chaldi to score, rather than claim the glory for himself as he was marked.
Lukaku was aware and showed great selflessness to allow Nacer to score, beamed Martinez.  AFP

Nearly 70% of Colombo City Centre Residences sold out
Nearly 70% of all residential units at the Colombo City Centre have already been sold, said Devadharshan Jayadeva, CFO of Colombo City Centre.
In addition to the growing high and middle income urban Sri Lankan residents, a number of professional Sri Lankans living abroad have also invested in our residences. We also recently returned from the UK where an international sales campaign generated a significant amount of interest among potential buyers.
With several high-rise developments taking shape, the capital appreciation rate of luxury apartments in Colombo is estimated to have exceeded 10% in recent years, emphasising the preference of Sri Lankans to invest in real estate over other assets. Likewise, The Residences at Colombo City Centre are a prime example of a modern investment opportunity and has already earned a reputation as an attractive asset to own in the future.
2-bedroom apartments, 3-bedroom townhouse style residences, and 4 or 5-room penthouses begin from the 18th floor.
A 7% rental guarantee for 2 years adds a promising dimension to these investments, while the project is also able to offer a higher internal rate of return (IRR) due to its integrated offering, which includes the establishment of Sri Lankas first international shopping mall.
A highly anticipated addition to the capitals fast-developing skyline, Colombo City Centre is Sri Lankas first BOI-approved mixed development project, slated for completion in early 2019. The USD 180 Million joint venture between local retail giant, Abans, and Singapore-based Next Story Group is one of Sri Lankas largest foreign direct investments in recent times, and rises 47-storeys above the heart of the city.

EXPOSURE ON MR CAMPAIGN FUNDING in 2015:
New York Times concerned over threats to Journalists
The New York Times releasing an official statement yesterday called on the Sri Lankan authorities to ensure the safety of the Sri Lankan journalists who contributed to the recent Times article on the Hambantota Port.
New York Times, International Editor, Michael Slackman releasing a statement on twitter said, A group of Sri Lankan Parliamentarians allied with the former President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, held a news conference to publicly criticise two journalists who contributed logistical assistance to a rigorously reported and accurate New York Times investigation into the Hambantota Port, published on June 26.
Slackman added that the actions of the Parliamentarians to intimidate the journalists was unacceptable and was intended to silence critics and curb press freedoms and ultimately deprive Sri Lankans of information in the public interest.
He further asked that if Rajapaksa had issue with the article, he was welcome to contact the senior editors at the New York Times, rather than intimidating Sri Lankan journalists.
The New York Times in their article had alleged that the former President received USD 7.6 million from the Chinese Company China Harbour Engineering Company during the 2014 Presidential campaign.
The article also alleges that the Chinese by funding Rajapaksas campaign and his other activities managed to get him to sign over the Hambantota Port to them.
The Joint Opposition has strongly rejected the above claims and questioned the credibility of the article and the journalists involved.

Neymar unfazed by critics after sweet and sour display downs Mexico
SAMARA, Russia, Monday: Brazil superstar Neymar brushed off his critics after firing the five-time World Cup winners to victory over Mexico on Monday and into a quarter-final showdown with Belgium.
Neymar scored one goal and created another as his increasingly impressive Brazil side overpowered the Mexicans 2-0 in sweltering conditions.
But Neymars sparkling performance was tarnished by yet another example of his tendency to overreact to seemingly innocuous challenges.
The latest chapter in a bulging catalogue of histrionic behaviour came in the second half, when Mexico midfielder Miguel Layun appeared to step on his ankle as he lay prone. Neymar writhed around and convulsed as if he had received an electric shock.
I think its a shame for football, Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio lamented afterwards, saying Neymars antics had wasted precious time.
We wasted a lot of time because of one single player ... we lost our style in the second half, because of the referee.
This is a very bad example for the world and the world of football.
ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC
As social media platforms exploded with fans angrily accusing Neymar of cheating, former England striker Alan Shearer described the Paris Saint-Germain star as absolutely pathetic.
There is no doubting the ability of him. He is a magnificent player, said Shearer, who is working in Russia for Britains BBC.
But it really is pathetic when he is rolling around as if he is in agony.
Yet Neymar shrugged off the criticism after his man-of-the-match performance, claiming it was motivated to undermine me.
I dont care much for criticism, or praise, because this can influence your attitude, he said.
In the last two matches I didnt talk to the press because I dont want to. I just have to play, help my teammates, help my team.
Brazil defender Thiago Silva meanwhile heaped praise on Neymar, who only returned to playing shortly before the tournament following an injury layoff of more than three months.
Its magnificent how hes playing, especially after three and a half months on the sidelines, PSG teammate Silva said. Its very difficult to come back the way hes done.
Against Mexico, Neymar burst into life after Brazil weathered early pressure from opponents determined to end a 32-year wait to reach the quarter-finals.
The 26-year-old talisman struck the opening goal on 51 minutes to Brazil 1-0 up.
The Brazil talisman drew several defenders as he ran across the edge of the area with the ball at his feet, before passing to Willian and continuing his run into the box.
Willian duly returned the favour and Neymar was on hand to poke the Chelsea midfielders superb delivery past Guillermo Ochoa.
As Mexico lost heart, Brazil could have added more as probing counters carved open Mexicos defence, Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro notably testing Ochoa with a drive the keeper blocked. The result was settled when Layun lost possession in the dying minutes. Neymar went on a counter-attack that drew Ochoa from his goal before finding Roberto Firmino with the finest of touches from the outside of his right boot. With only two goals, Neymar is lagging well behind England star Harry Kanes tournament-leading tally of five goals.
But Silva is hoping Neymar emulates the recent feats of other Paris Saint-Germain clubmates Edinson Cavani and Kylian Mbappe on his way to taking Brazil further.
Its true, I said this before this match, added Silva. I hope he listens to me in the quarter-finals.  AFP

Not poetry alone
Gratiaen Prize winner Jean Arasanayagam is not merely a fantastic poet but also a social critic and a great teacher. Everybody who is interested in English literature knows her both here and elsewhere. There is no point in making hosannas about her or her writing. Her prize-winning poetry book The Life of The Poet comprising 46 poems, short and long are found within 122 pages in the book published by Sarasvati Publishers.
I am not wrong if I suppose her writing is elitist ad would be greatly understood and appreciated by scholars and serious lovers of literature. Academic critics will have something positive in their evaluations.
In an email interview Jean Araanayagam, my dear friend, had given to Anshita Deval of the University of Rajasthan in Jaipur, India, the readers can read the poets mind and vision and her style of expression. Please read her lengthy replies given to only five questions. They are awe- inspiring and perceptive.
We must first understand what the author wants to say in her or his work before we pass judgement on the work. This helps us why we appreciate or dislike a work and do justice to the writer. It is easy to criticize a work but difficult to create or write. So, I leave it to your judgment.
What I can do is to select at random some of her lines which I find pregnant with deeper meaning and exquisite presentation.
In the title poem she writes:
No, the true poet is never the victor, never seeks the cheers of vociferous voices or the applause surging crowds owning the voice of spontaneous utteranceThe life of the poet is made up of fragments that create a mosaic patterning of words on the walls of temples, sanctuaries, cathedrals filled with the symbolic language that only the initiate can decipher, a second map that guides the searcher on the journey through passage after passage, the tortuous mazes and labyrinths of history.
Please read the rest of her stanzas to relish on the words she uses to mesmerize our thought process. It reminds me of classical poetry of the Greek dramatists through Shakespeare to Eliot, Yeats and the contemporary poets.
In another poem titled Maps of Self-Discovery, the poet bemoans with assurance of the present.
Recalling that past, of what use is it, those people who engendered me have vanished long, long go. The architecture of their abodes built with nostalgia to resemble the old country, have no longer significance to me, I do not wish to be incarcerated in the past What could be the poets inner self wants Look here:
My true self cloaked in magical mystical disguise walks freely on the crowded streets of the world
I strive, journey on in that exodus to the Canaan land of milk and honey to reach my own visionary lands of the mind, the imagination Here are more captivating phrases and lines in her poetry: Memory, buried in the incinerators of the mind.
Hope remains, everlasting, that vanquishes all evil that has escaped from Pandoras mythic box. Wrench birth from the unyielding womb of nature, a poem awakening into light, dispelling darkness. Flowering and fruiting in the private arbours of the mind It no longer matters that the garment of my skin that clothed my flesh, grows dull and faded We are all poems we read in each other faces, I create and read in your faces
Jean Arasanayagam is not merely a creative poet but also a commentator on social issues. Please read her to find out the truth.

Commencing in true Oriflame style, the participants were given a memorable welcome, escorted by the management and the staff of the Company in a spectacular motor bike parade. Adding to the delight of the Oriflame leaders of Sri Lanka, was the arrival of their Vice President South Asia, Sergei Kanashin and Sales Director South Asia, Pradnya Deshpande.
In addition to them were also the Local Managers, D. D. Samanthilake and Kalana Perera who enlivened the event by arriving on bikes to greet and welcome those who have been responsible for successfully spreading Oriflames presence in Sri Lanka.

Oriflames Senior Vice President for South Asia, Sergei Kanashin reiterated the global dynamics and growth potential of Oriflame in Asia, which has experienced a rapid year-on-year growth with a dramatically increased market share.

Referring to the exponential development of Oriflame Sri Lanka, Area Manager Sri Lanka D. D. Samanthilake said that the leaders have performed exceptionally thus far in 2018, with a significant growth spurt compared to last year. He then went onto outline Oriflames plans to expand its market potential in Sri Lanka, while creating an innovative outlook in the near future.
The highlight of the first day was launch of the brand new Top 15 Leaders for 2018-2019 and the Australian themed night. This was followed by the programme for Day Two, which commenced with a yoga session which enhanced the participants level of concentration.
They were then privy to learning testimonies and informative sessions which maximised their growth potential to a vast extent. Day Two also gave the participants an insight into the exciting and unique launches lined up for the forthcoming quarters.
The euphoric atmosphere culminated in the most exclusive celebratory event in which all the top leaders achievements were recognised on grand scale. The highlight was the official handing over of the project contract for the proposed building of a fully furnished library for the Wetakoluwagama Kanitu Viduhala to its Principal Upali Ekanayake. The grand finale was the launch of the newest product range NovAge Men which was showcased by Oriflames handsome models on stage.
Our aim for the following year is to celebrate Oriflames growth with the highest participation and more title achievers. With the support of all players, were committed to making Oriflame Sri Lanka a Diamond Bliss to the world, affirmed Local Managers, D. D. Samanthilake and Kalana Perera.

Painter in a  retrospective plain

Born in 1947 at Weligama, Matara, S H Sarath is one of the remarkable painters who emerged in Sri Lanka. His works of art are unique and extremely meaningful. Sarath belongs to the post-independent generation of Sri Lankan artists. After completing a five-year course in painting at the Government School of Fine Arts (1968-1973) he followed postgraduate studies in art at the Silpakon University in Thailand under a UNESCO fellowship. Thereafter he completed a course in printmaking at the University of South Australia, Adelaide, in 1995.
Sarath's art is impressive. He reflects thousands of thoughts through a single painting. Once again he is going to exhibit his talents. Sarath has come up with a new collection of his paintings which carries out some provisional social themes and issues. Sarath's drawings are full of social consciousness, satire, sarcasm, irony and multi-religious philosophy. Each and every drawing portrays a thematic content which is very topical. He tries to highlight aspects of the prevailing society through his paintings. He has held a large number of both international and local painting exhibitions.
Sarath's inborn talent is marvellous and very unique. His art ranges from 18th century's traditional Sinhala art as well as those of contemporary Western art. At the beginning of his career, he has worked as a costume designer and a make-up artist as well.
Saraths latest painting exhibition titled Retrospective will be held at the JDA Perera Gallery on July 4 and 5. The painting exhibition marks 50 years of Saraths career as a painter.

Dont act like hooligans, Speaker warns MPs Weerawansa, Ranaweera
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya strongly reprimanded Joint Opposition MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Prasanna Ranaweera in Parliament yesterday, over their unruly behaviour.
MP Weerawansa was seen leading the JO group in the Well of the House shouting slogans and hurling abuse at the Chair. Both Weerawansa and Ranaweera repeatedly defied the orders of the Speaker and behaved in an aggressive manner, pointing their fingers at the Speaker.
You cannot threaten the Chair. I assure you that I will take appropriate action. Let me do that following the due procedure. I would like to remind MP Weerawansa that statements such as bombing or setting fire to Parliament had also been uttered in the past. We have to continue the days business as there is important legislation before the House. Weerawansa tried to play games. There has to be discipline in the House. If you continue to disturb the proceedings, I will have to name you. You spoke in filthy language and behaved in a very demeaning manner. This behaviour is a disgrace to the House, the Speaker warned MP Weerawansa.
Miffed by repeated abuses hurled at him, the Speaker thoroughly warned MP Ranaweera, stating, Be careful. You cannot act here as you did in at the Kelaniya PS. This is Parliament. Your behavior is like that of a hooligan,  he said.
The Speaker came to a head when MP Ranaweera, who was repeatedly hurling abuse at the Speaker, tried to grab the Mace and run. The Serjeant-at-Arms Anil Parakrama Samarasekara, his Deputy and Assistant, prevented the MP from running away with the Mace. UNP members Thushara Indunil, Lucky Jayawardena and Nalin Bandara also rushed to the Well of the House and blocked MP Ranaweera. The Speaker at this point named MP Ranaweera and ordered him out of the House. As MP Ranaweera remained in the House, he ordered the Serjeant-at-Arms to remove him, but Parliament was adjourned before the order was executed.
MP Ven Rathana Thera also objecting to Vijayakala Maheshwarans statement, called on the Speaker to take serious action. He was seen approaching the Speakers chair and demanding for disciplinary action, to which the Speaker replied that he had already assured the House that he would hold an inquiry.

He made these observations in answer to an oral question raised by JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, with regard to investments done by the University Grants Commission in the Central Bank Treasury bonds.
JVP MP Jayatissa also urged Parliament that a special investigation be carried out on investing University Provident Funds and the Mahapola Fund in Treasury bonds. He proposed that the Committee on Public Enterprises be permitted to carry out investigations. Jayatissa went on to say that the UGC had failed its academic and non-academic staff due to these losses incurred from investing in the questioned Treasury bonds. He also quoted a recent statement by Dr. Nirmal Ranjith Devasiri who had said that he had lost Rs. 1 Million due to these losses.
In answer to MP Jayatissas request, Grero said that he was in full agreement of such an investigation. This matter is directly relevant to the Treasury bond scam investigation. So, an investigation on the misappropriation of these funds could also be linked to the main investigation, Grero said.
Further, speaking on the matter, Grero pointed out that the matter was related to the Treasury bond issue which happened in 2015. The UGC investment was Rs. 1 Billion. With such irregularities that took place in the relevant bond issuance, the UGC had incurred losses around Rs. 100 Million. It is a gigantic loss. There is no argument that whoever was responsible for the losses, should be brought to task. There is always a risk in investment. We invest looking for profit, but sometimes we have to endure losses as well.
Following Greros answer, MP Wimal Weerawansa alleged that the former Higher Education Minister should be held responsible for the investment. According to Weerawansa, tha Higher Education Minister at that time was Minister Lakshman Kiriella. However, JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake rose to point out that in fact it was Minister Kabir Hashim who held the said portfolio.
Minister Kiriella in answer to Weerawansas allegation, said that the UGC had its funds in an NSB account, while that money was invested in Treasury bonds.
Meanwhile, in answer to JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissas initial question on the number of vacancies for lecturers serving in government medical faculties as at June 30, 2017, Grero said that there are 350 vacancies in the permanent cardre and 272 in temporary the cardre.
Grero also said that the Medical Faculty of the Moratuwa University would be opened in 2019. He also said that the government in a historic move was taking 160 medical students in to government universities in the years 2017/2018. Accordingly, 75 medical students would be taken into the new medical faculty in the Wayamba University and another 75 to the Sabaragamuwa University.
In relation to vacancies for lecturers, Grero pointed out that most lecturers only wished to work in universities closer to urban areas. He requested the lecturers to work in universities located in rural areas at least for one year. He also pointed out that lecturers are granted an extremely beneficial package including a 135% -140% academic allowance and vehicle permits for every five year.
Bill to amend Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act inconsistent with Constitution -SC
The Supreme Court (SC) has determined that two clauses of the Bill to amend Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act are inconsistent with the Constitution, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament yesterday.
The Speaker, making an announcement at the commencement of sittings, said the SC in its determination sent to Parliament after concluding the hearing of petitions challenging the Bill, has stated that Clause 5(3) and 5A are inconsistent with the Constitution.
The SC had ruled that the Bill either had to be passed with a two thirds majority in Parliament, or be amended as per SCs recommendations to make it consistent with the Constitution.
The Bill was presented for First Reading in Parliament on June 5. The Bill broadens the scope of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act to include tracing of crimes committed via internet, information communications technology, cloud computing, blockchain technology and the trading in of any digital currencies.
The Act provides for combating transnational crimes and strengthening the prevention of crimes. The amendment had included new sections to provide for the facilitation of video conferencing technology and joint investigations for the above purposes.
The Bill had expanded the grounds of refusing assistance by including instances where the criminal investigations or proceedings have commenced in Sri Lanka. It has provided provisions to expedite the process of taking evidence or receiving documents or articles for investigations.
A new part had been added the Act, to provide for the assistance in relation to findings of bribery of foreign public officials or officials of public international organizations.
NIE higher education qualifications to teachers from training colleges
The National Institute of Education (NIE) will take necessary steps to grant higher education qualifications to teachers who pass out from teacher training colleges, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
They will not only able to receive a degree level qualification, but also they can study until post graduate level, Minister Kariyawasam said.
Minister Kariyawasam also said that 2100 applicants have been interviewed for schools in the estate sector.
He agreed that there is a shortage of Science and Maths teachers in government schools.
We have called for vacancies but the number of applicants is a minimum. We may have to find other options to solve this issue, he said.
Former Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara questioned Minister Kariyawasam on the cancellation of an allowance granted for Acting Principals.
Minister Kariyawasam pointed out there are many political appointments in the Acting Principals category.
Because of them we are not able to appoint the officers in the Sri Lankan Principal Service who were selected through a government examination. We were able to appoint only 500 of the selected 4000 Principals. If we give the Acting Principals another allowance, they will never leave their posts. Minister Kariyawasam pointed out.
Minister Kariyawasam also said that the government has instructed to give the Acting Principals, Deputy Principal post when they leave their present post.

Pathfinder Foundation Conducts Seminar on Maritime Security
Centre for the Law of the Sea at the Pathfinder Foundation headed by Admiral Professor Jayanath Colombage, conducted a three-day national level seminar/work shop on International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code) at Mahapola Ports and Maritime Academy of Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) for stakeholder participants.
The Pathfinder Foundation commenced its Centre for the Law of the Sea (CLS) at Riverpoint, Peliyagoda first week of January this year and officially released an Occasional Paper containing a draft Code of Conduct for the Indian Ocean. This draft Code of Conduct is open for public discussion and is accessible on the Pathfinder Foundation website: www.pathfinderfoundation.org.
Admiral Prof. Colombage is a pioneer member in ISPS Code implementation in the country and certified by the IMO as a trainer in ISPS Code. He has been the main subject matter expert in conducting national level training programmes on ISPS Code and training stakeholders from SLPA Security personnel and naval personnel in maintaining ISPS Code.
The training program of ISPS Code was organized by Director of Port Security, Major General (Retd.) Gamini Hettiarachchi in liaison with Chief Training Manager of Mahapola Ports and Maritime Academy, Sarath Dayananda. Director Human Resources of SLPA, P. Ranathunga was the chief guest at the inaugural session of the seminar. 175 participants representing SLPA security, operations, planning and other divisions from the ports of Colombo, Trincomalee, Galle and Oluvil; Sri Lanka Navy, Colombo International Container Terminal(CICT), South Asia Gateway Terminal(SAGT), Colombo Dockyard Limited(CDL), Tokyo Cement, Master Divers, Colombo Port Power Barge and Ceylon Grain Elevators took part in the three-day national seminar.
This seminar was to familiarize participants with concepts and principles of maritime security as specified in the ISPS Code. The ISPS Code came to be effective since 01st July 2004 and Sri Lankan ports led the ISPS compliance in the region at that juncture. After the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York on September 11, 2001, there was a renewed focus on maritime security.
A ship arriving in a commercial port carrying a weapon of mass destruction capable of destroying the port and adjacent population centers was considered a possible threat scenario and a major security concern. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) at a diplomatic conference held in London in 2002, decided to adopt a new maritime security regime called the ISPS Code.
The main objective of the ISPS Code is Prevention and Suppression of Acts of Terrorism Against Shipping. The ISPS Code was launched as an amendment and a new chapter to the Safety of Life at Sea 1974 (SOLAS) Convention. The ISPS Code together with other security measures, such as Mega Port Initiative (MPI), Container Security Initiative (CSI) and Code of Conduct for security in Ports contributed immensely to safeguard the Port of Colombo, which was a high priority economic and military target of the terrorists until 2009. The ISPS Code paved the way for implementing cooperative and collaborative security measures with positive contribution from all stakeholders in ports.
Sri Lanka Navy was instrumental in conducting risk analysis and Port Facility Security Assessments and drawing up Port Facility Security Plans for all commercial ports in the country, conducting security audits, training drills and exercises, and maintaining security as per the ISPS Code SINCE 2004.
Even to-date, Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy is the designated authority and all Port Facility Security Officers (PFSO) are active duty senior naval officers, including the new port at Hambantota. Director General Merchant Shipping is nominated as the administrator as per the ISPS Code.
The presentation of certificates at the end of the seminar was chaired by the deputy Chief Training Manager of Mahapola Ports and Maritime Academy, S H Thilakapala.

Postal strike likely to recommence
The postal trade union alliance would commence another postal strike if the Postal Department is unable to pay the salaries of workers for the month of June, said convener Chintaka Bandara.
We held discussions with the Posts Minister, Postmaster General and the Postal Secretary, but they have failed to respond to our demands, he said. According to the convener, 26,000 workers are facing difficulties as they have not received their salaries. Therefore, he said, a strike would be called if the demands are not met by today. When the Daily News inquired about the previous demands which led to the previous postal strike for 16 days, the convener said authorities had acted on it. However, they have not been able to solve the issue with regard to the expectations of the postal trade union alliance.
Our strike to be convened on July 4 would only be with regard to salaries. He added that the posts, which were halted during the strike, were distributed.

Potter invisibility cloak almost a reality
Scientists have long believed the key to an invisibility cloak, as featured in Harry Potter , is the manipulation of light. The fundamentally new approach overcomes critical shortcomings of previous attempts.
It offers hope of securing data transmitted over fibre optic lines, thwarting eavesdroppers, and improving technologies for sensing, telecommunications and information processing.
The concept, theoretically, could also be extended to make 3D objects invisible from all directions, said the researchers.
The spectral cloak operates by selectively transferring energy between certain colours of the light wave.
After the wave has passed through the object, the device restores the light to its original state. When viewing an object, what you are really seeing is the way in which it modifies the energy of the light waves that interact with it.
Luis Romero Cortes, a student in the lab who specialises in quantum optics, explained: Conventional cloaking solutions rely on altering the propagation path of the illumination around the object to be concealed.
This way, different colours take different amounts of time to traverse the cloak, resulting in easily detectable distortion that gives away the presence of the cloak.
Our proposed solution avoids this problem by allowing the wave to propagate through the target object, rather than around it, while still avoiding any interaction between the wave and the object.
The study, published in the journal Optica, used a technique that rearranged different colours of broadband light so the wave propagates through the object without actually seeing it.
To do this, the spectral cloak first shifts the colours toward regions of the spectrum that will not be affected by propagation through the object.
For example, if the object reflects green light, then light in the green range might be shifted to blue - so there would be no green light for it to reflect.
Then, once the wave has cleared the object, the cloaking device reverses the shift, reconstructing the wave in its original state.
The team demonstrated their approach by concealing an optical filter, a device that selectively transmits different wavelengths of light, after illuminating it with a laser.
The cloaking device was constructed from two pairs of commercially available components called an dispersive optical fiber and a temporal phase modulator placed in front of the filter and behind it.
The former forces different colours of a broadband wave to travel at different speeds. while the latter modifies the optical frequency.
This showed the spectral cloak was able to transform the light waves in the range of frequencies that would have been absorbed by the optical filter, then completely reverse the process as the light wave exited the filter on the other side.
It made it look as though the laser pulse had propagated through a non-absorbing medium.
The device could also find applications beyond invisibility cloaking. For example, selectively removing and reinstating colours in the broadband waves could allow more telecommunication data to be transmitted, reducing logjams.
Prof Azana said it should be possible to make an object invisible under illumination from every direction.

Powerful, Miracle, Invisible Third Eye
Yoga & Hypnotism Therapist, Counselor
When you open your third eye or activate your pineal gland, it raises the level of insight and intuition in you.
Your level of consciousness increases. You can see the unseen.
You must have heard about "Third Eye" in Hindu mythologies (also known as Anja, Brow, chakra). The great Lord Shiva used to open his third eye when he was angry and burnt things into ash.
So don't get confused when asked about your eyes and their count. "Two" as a reply would be wrong in the sense that your "Third eye" is the most powerful part of your body that possesses actual reality.
It's not a perception but sheer truth. In modern times, it signifies enlightenment, pre-recognition, and freedom from out-world experiences.
What Is Third Eye
Your third eye is always available but invisible, unlike our other eyes.
It gives us insight, knowledge, and wisdom about what happened in the past, what is currently ongoing in the present and what is going to occur in future.
It acts as an intuition i.e. it sees the unknown, unseen and feels unfelt. Have you ever been suddenly stopped by your mother from taking your bike out This is her intuition that is nothing but her third eye energy. This power comes from her higher dimension of love and devotion towards you. This factor is called the sixth sense.
You may sometimes find yourself watched by someone or may feel the presence of someone behind your back. This is nothing but the truth, which deals with the presence of spirits around you. I won't go that far inside as some people might get scared, but one thing for sure is that your third eye makes their presence felt.
The things you want to know are already based on you. You just need a kick to take it out. Meditation can be that source of punch, providing you with a particular path to harness that energy. You don't have to visit your Psychic or depend on your zodiac sign. Just try to access your intuition through deep meditation.
The man is always held together by his daily virtues of emotions and stress. Try to control them through your consciousness that will help you to become self-confident and self-controlled about your awareness skills. This will develop your 'sense' and 'sight'. Once you become aware of your intelligence, you'll try to expand them.
Advanced consciousness, makes the world a small place. Meditation not only helps you in becoming conscious but also develops new passions inside you.
You can easily deal with all ongoing earthly tensions, and your anxieties will reduce gradually. This will make you a man on a mission.
Another third eye beauty is that it suppresses your negative thoughts and thinking. It's in human nature to be worried and anxious about the tasks to complete.
This results in negative thoughts. But once it goes, a clean conscious energy takes its place. This can be achieved with regular meditation.
The third eye helps you to get rid of bad imaginations and vague dreams. People always tend to dream of things that they are presently dealing with; a lower vibration can make these dreams bad and inconclusive.
Anything about your lifestyle, relationship, job and goals can give you nightmares if left unanswered. But they can be avoided with 'third eye' i.e. with a clear vision through meditation.
How To Open Your Third Eye
Your third eye is symbolized by the colour' indigo.' It is present between the brows and associated with time and light.
Eat dark bluish fruits, liquids, and spices; wear purple clothing to get the feel of your third eye.
Start meditating and try to make yourself calm and composed.
I will explain you a simple step to open your third eye.
Sit in a calm room where no noise effect can reach.
Close your eyes and slowly try to feel your inhalation and exhalation to calm your nerves.
While inhaling, bring your focus to a particular energy form.
Now focus this energy on the third eye chakra.
Start imagining a purple ball of energy which grows bigger and bigger with each breathes, at the location of your third eye.
Release all your negative thoughts, anxieties, fear and stress while exhaling.
Continue until you feel yourself light and free from all worldly attractions, resulting in warmth in-between the brows.
Once you feel this warmth, your third eye opens.
Another simple way can be while taking a head bath or shower in water, which is neither too hot nor cold.
Feel the water falling on your head. Imagine the water molecules absorbing all the negative thoughts from your body.
Try this continuously. After few days, you'll feel relaxed, and this will help in building up new energies inside you.
Benefits Of Awakening Third Eye
Your intuition increases (sense of future)
It makes you more aware and conscious
Increased Astral travel
Telepathic motions
It increases self-confidence and self-trust
It improves your spiritual qualities
It helps in understanding the universe
It helps in finding your answers from the surroundings
It improves your interpreting power
It reduces anxiety, pain, and fear
It takes you beyond analysis, reasoning, and rationalization.
It helps you in making better decisions
It acts as a guide in your path of life
It increases your skills and abilities.
It helps you communicate with higher and lower dimension
My Experience
I practised 3rd eye meditation, two weeks in India.
Then after returned I trained some children below 15 years old. The practice of 03 days, their 3rd eye opened and they could do some abnormal activities when covered their eyes a piece of Cloth.
Example of some activities.
1. Reading Books
2. Identify colours
3. Identify their relations with other people.
4. Can recognize an unknown person by their name.
5. Identify the owner of some equipment
These activities are in primary level to Indian high spiritual people but this is a very expensive training course in India in China, Japan they practice the 3rd eye activation to their young generation because they know the benefits of this activity.
For Sri Lanka, I started the training sessions of 3rd eye activation recently, especially under 15 years.

Private equity financing crucial for SME development
Private equity financing could play a crucial role in the development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and social enterprises in Sri Lanka, Chairman, Lanka Impact Investing Network, Chandula Abeywickrama said.
Private equity investors could help to create, deepen and expand growth of small and medium enterprises. In addition to capital, private equity investors bring knowledge and expertise to the companies in which they invest, Abeywickrama said.
Speaking at the launch of a report on Status of Social Enterprise Sector in Sri Lanka 2017 last Friday in Colombo he said, SMEs operating in Sri Lanka are more likely to be credit constrained and are paying significantly higher interest rates. However, in the last five years, there has been a surge in social entrepreneurship across Sri Lanka following the end of the war.
Nevertheless, social entrepreneurship cant be powered unless there is conducive landscape for investing culture. Furthermore, entrepreneurship cannot be blossomed under a heavy debt culture in the country. We need to surpass that level where a high rate of interest regime moves to an impact investing culture.
Abeywickrama further said that genuine SMEs have not been able to utilize World Bank, International Finance Corporation (IFC) or Asian Development Bank (ADB) financed SME refinance credit schemes due to various reasons.
He said a 70% of these funds are channeled through commercial and corporate businesses.
According to a social enterprise sector report in Sri Lanka, there is an estimated 6, 000 to 15,000 social enterprises in the country covering major sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, cultural, creative and environmental protection sectors.
In addition, about 41% of social enterprises direct their surpluses towards achieving collective social or environmental aims and also there is a striking gender gap in social enterprises with 31% women in leadership roles in social enterprises compared to men which account for 69%.
The majority of the social enterprises have drawn upon external funding sources in their business ventures with 24% having accessed loans, 21% having received donations and another 21% report having received grants.
The report highlights some of the biggest barriers facing social enterprises as lack of awareness and understanding of social enterprises among the public, lack of targeted support for the sector from the government and other influential organizations in the areas of technical, managerial and financial support.

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam condemned the measures taken by several trade unions (TU) attached to the Education sector to hold strikes as it was an movement to destroy the countrys education system.
The said trade unions were attempting to impede the plans implemented by the Education Ministry to promote 1,011 teachers and principals who had faced injustice during the previous regime.
However, the trade unions claimed that the ministry was going to promote political henchmen instead and as a response, Minister Kariyawasam said all promotions would be carried out through an impartial and transparent legal mechanism, adding that no unsuitable or disqualified persons would receive any promotions.
The minister condemned the claims of several trade unions, while stating that they were baseless accusations. He also condemned the behaviour of a print media organisation and said that the said paper published false media reports for narrow political gains.
Could a newspaper close the schools within a country Decisions with regard to schools are taken by the Education Ministry, not by a newspaper, the minister said.
He added that 6,000 teachers were promoted sans any transparent mechanism during the previous regime, but the current government had received Cabinet approval as well as approval from the State Service Commission for the aforementioned purpose.

Progress in SL significant but slow: U.S. Ambassador nominee
In her June 28 testimony for confirmation by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, nominee for Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Alaina Teplitz praised the progress on reform and justice in the country, saying, Sri Lanka has come a long way since voters in 2015 rejected the corruption, strife, and repression of the past and threw their support behind a reform, reconciliation and accountability agenda.
At the same time, she referred to the anti-Muslim riots in March as a painful example of how the work of mending inter-ethnic and inter-religious fissures remains incomplete.
Overall, Teplitz had a hopeful outlook for the future of U.S.-Sri Lankan relations, describing a shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, and affirming that the U.S. supports the growth of Sri Lankas capacity to make greater contributions to regional stability while protecting its own sovereignty and national interests.
In contrast, Teplitz had bleak assessment of the situation in Maldivesa nation of atolls that faces serious challenges, from the spread of extremism and environmental threats such as encroaching seas, coastal degradation, and national disasters, to the curtailment of freedom of expression and other democratic rights under the current government.
In part because of the starkly different scenarios she depicted in her testimony, Teplitz seemed to suggest that Sri Lanka would become an increasingly more significant U.S. ally in the region: if confirmed, I will work in both Sri Lanka and Maldives to advance U.S. values and a shared vision of good governance, transparent economic development, free navigation and commerce, fair and open investment environments, and a stable, rules-based regional order.

Putting the countrys cricket back on track  Sports Minister has to take the initiative
When iconic cricketers such as Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara, Muthiah Muralitharan and Roshan Mahanama who have served for over a decade and brought honour and distinction to the country through cricket turned down a formal request made by the national selectors through the Minister of Sports to serve in the capacity of consultants to help resuscitate the countrys dipping fortunes, there has to be a very good reason for it.
The reason these cricketing legends gave was that they had no trust in the system.
What that means is that the recent current cricket administration cannot be trusted and as the past two years have proved it has only brought Sri Lanka cricket down to its knees.
Why these players have refused is not that they are turning their backs on the countrys cricket but with a change of administration and with the right people in place they would certainly extend a helping hand. They do not want to tarnish their good name by being tagged with the present set of administrators many of whom have several question marks against their names.
Coming on the heels of that rebut is a letter sent to the Minister of Sport signed by several past presidents of Sri Lanka Cricket urging him to appoint an interim committee to clean up the mess that the countrys cricket has fallen into.
The saddest part of interim committees is that they cannot run for a long period of time as the ICC does not encourage government appointed committees.
Also, when the interim committee has put the administration back on track elections are called for and all the good work done is brought to naught when the elected officials go back and repeat the same mistakes that had led to the appointment of the interim committee itself. This scenario has become part and parcel of the countrys cricket history.
One of the signatories to the letter calling for a change of administration is Rienzie Wijetilleke the first chairman of the interim committee that was appointed in 1999. It has to this day proved to be one of the best that has served Sri Lanka cricket.
But as has been the fate with all interim committees this committee with a wealth of knowledge and experience in cricket and in administration comprising Wijetilleke, Michael Tissera, S Skandakumar, Sidath Wettimuny, Ashantha de Mel and Kushil Gunasekera sadly didnt see eye to eye with the then Sports Minister SB Dissanayake that led to their resignation.
During their short tenure the Wijetilleke interim committee put forward a proposal that recognised the rights of the stake holders namely the clubs and affiliated associations to elect the office bearers annually. But what was most important was that it recommended in addition the creation of a Board of Governors (BOG) above these office bearers to ensure accountability.
The argument was that it was not prudent to leave it in the hands of honorary office bearers who get elected or rejected annually, the deployment of millions of dollars without sufficient checks and balances.
To be fair by the system it was also recommended that the Board of Governors should comprise partly of men with experience in the management of the game. A minimum of three past Chairmen/Presidents of IC/SLC were recommended to hold office on a rotation basis of say 2 to 3 years. Their familiarity with the affairs of SLC was an obvious advantage. At its end a further three members will be appointed on the same basis while the incumbents step down.
That Board will be further strengthened by a financial head of high standing and a judge of equal repute.
Over a period of time this proportion can be adjusted as required. The honorary office bearers will NOT be permitted to incur any expenditure above a specified limit without the approval of the BOG. All policy decisions will be referred to the Board for concurrence in effect creating a structure of accountability like in the private sector.
The BOG will meet every fortnight with special meetings convened when required and most importantly the decisions of the Board of Governors will be final and the Sports Minister will NOT interfere in their function.
It is doubtful that any radical changes will be forthcoming and quite unlikely that the Sports Minister would give up his hold on the game. What should be considered is a structure for accountability within the current system.
This is food for thought for the present Minister of Sport and one hopes he not only listens but acts meaningfully if he is really serious about uplifting the countrys cricket fortunes that at present is at low ebb.

Senior lawyer Dayasiri offers free services to defend those taking Vijayakala to Court
Senior Attorney-at-Law Gomin Dayasiri has offered his services free of charge to whomever who wished to take State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran to court over her recent comments with regard to the LTTE.
The State Minister of Child Affairs in a speech delivered on Monday (2), stated that the Tamils needed to the LTTE if they are to live freely in the country. She stressed that women and children were safer under the terrorist organization.
Through my example, I wish to teach a lesson to young lawyers that they can offer their services free to the nation and the soldiers who rendered a great service by eradicating terrorism in the country; with their lives, blood and limb to the cause, Dayasiri said.
As lawyers we have a responsibility to come forward. People like H.L.de Silva, S.A.Wickremanayake, H.S.Gunasekara appeared free in cases; in the question of merger-demerger of North East, the question of increasing powers of the Chief Minister of Northern Province, P-TOMS case and in the last case of getting all land distributed to the periphery by court orders of Shirani Bandaranayake and Sarath Silva back to the Central Government, he further said.
Dayasiri explained that the laws in the country did not allow a government minister to support a banned terrorist organisation or to propagate terrorism in the country, The President should take steps to remove her. It is bad for the country and party.
It was the Tamil people in the North who suffered most by terrorism in the North, he added. The State Ministers own husband, the late Uma Maheswaran too was killed by the LTTE.

Severe action against Maheshwaran, a must - JVP
JVP yesterday, urged Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and the Government to take action against State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran concerning her controversial speech made recently on the necessity of the LTTEs return.
At a press brief held at the Parliament premises yesterday evening, the JVP urged Speaker Jayasuriya to call upon the Parliament Privileges Committee to investigate into the matter.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath said that his party vehemently denounces the statement made by Deputy Minister Maheshwaran. He also demanded Deputy Minister Maheshwaran to apologize to the nation for uttering such a statement.
This situation cannot be gone unpunished. It would set a wrong example if it was not checked right now. As parliamentarians, we are bound by an oath never to support the separating of this country directly or indirectly. Maheswaran, with her statement, has violated that oath by calling the LTTE to return back. This is very disgusting and a violation of the Constitution as well. Therefore, we urge both the Speaker and the Government to take necessary action against her according to the Law, MP Herath said.
We have all suffered due to the LTTE and calling for the revival of a terrorist outfit was unconstitutional and against the oath she had taken as an MP. The Speaker should refer the matter to the Privileges Committee and hold an inquiry against the deputy minister. If she is found guilty, she should then be removed from the post of MP, he further added.
MP Herath also demanded the governments stand point over the matter as the statement was made in the presence of External Affairs Minister and the Internal Affairs Minister.
MP Herath said that there was an anarchy prevailing in the country owing to the increased underworld activities, drug cartel operations and killings. That was the reason people are calling for a Hitler-type leaders and the LTTE. The government which did nothing while the country was sliding towards anarchy, should now take responsibility, he said.
Herath also said that yesterdays disruption of Parliament sittings could have been avoided lest the government took action against the Deputy Minister immediately.
JVP MPs Bimal Ratnayake and Sunil Hendunnetti were also present.

Singer Fashion Academy offers csd validated courses
Singer Fashion Academy has recently become the first Sri Lankan institute to receive Validated status for courses from the Chartered Society of Designers (CSD), UK within CSDs Course Endorsement Programme (CEP).
The Chartered Society of Designers UK is the worlds largest Royal chartered body of professional designers with members in 33 countries and is unique in representing designers in all disciplines. The Society is internationally recognised as the professional body for designers and authority on professional design practice.
CSD believes Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is essential for professional designers practicing in the dynamic world of design.
In keeping with this belief and within the ethos of its Course Endorsement Programme, the Society has endorsed the award of CSD Validated Course to the Singer Fashion Academys; Diploma in Scientific Dress Making, Diploma in Machine Embroidery, Certificate in Basic Scientific Dress Making, Certificate in Machine Embroidery and Certificate in Saree Blouse. This validated status licence is for the next five years.
CSD Validated Course status is awarded to CPD modules, training courses and online study programmes that comply with the high standards set within CEP.
As the first local body to receive any form of validation from CSD, the Singer Fashion Academy now offers an internationally recognised academic path for its students to scale greater heights within the global design industry, said Asoka Pieris, Group CEO, Singer Sri Lanka.
Singer Fashion Academy students who follow a CSD Validated Course can easily apply for Student Membership status from the Society with no application or joining fee and they will also enjoy clear progression to other membership levels offered.
CSD Student Membership offers a host of benefits including credibility, networking, online portfolio, directory listing with public profile, professional development, up to date news from the design industry, etc,.
Singer Fashion Academy students also gain access to digital content such as magazines, reports, advice columns, book reviews, portfolio galleries and much more.
Helping students gain knowledge on the latest international fashion trends, the Singer Fashion Academy, has initiated and enabled access to the Burda Style, the fashion magazine of international repute, for all students.
Importantly, the Singer Fashion Academy courses are also now listed on the CSD main website providing global recognition for the local institute.
Previously, access to a globally recognised certificate in fashion and design has been limited to a few in the Colombo suburbs. However, with Singer Fashion Academy conducting classes at over 70 locations island-wide, it no longer poses a restriction for current and prospective students to enrol and benefit from CSD Validated Course status.
Inclusion in the Societys programme also offers an advantage to all students when seeking employment as the validation enhances the status of designers locally as well as on an international stage.
This collaboration is a significant development in our programme which seeks to establish international understanding and cultural relationships within the design sector for the benefit of the profession and society, noted Frank Peters, CEO CSD.

## Title: Sir John Kotelawala in retirement

Sir John Kotelawala in retirement
A man who practised what he preached; Kotelawala was such a pleasure-seeker that people did not take him seriously. After being a minister for 23 years and Prime Minister for three and a half, he lost the general election in 1956, and preferred not to involve in serious politics at the age of 61, but remained an MP for a few more years, till his life became essentially a private and contented retirement, shuttling between Kandawela and Kent.
Born with the proverbial silver spoon in the mouth on April 4, 1895 General Sir John Kotelawala was a soldier and politician, who served as Prime Minister from 1953 to 1956. John Kotelawala Snr, the tough policeman who became very popular after raiding notorious gaming dens of Nainage Sooduwa fame 100 years ago, was his father. JK (senior) retired as a senior police officer to engage in running wifes property. Prosperous planter and arrack renter from Madapatha, Piliyandala, Mudaliyar DCG Attygalle had three daughterseldest, Alice Elizabeth who carried a dowry of 2,058 acres of cultivated coconut and rubber plantations and a share of Kahatagaha plambego Mines (M Roberts-1979) married our third PMs father who was a police constable at the time and also from Madapatha. (There are unconfirmed reports or village gossip on this unusual union.)
Young John Lionel attended Royal College, Colombo, before he went on a trip to England and France, and finally attended Cambridge Universitys Christ's College to study agriculture.
On retirement, Sir John divided his time between motherland and England; this legendary socialite, spend his best months of the English summer in a garden paradise at Brogues Wood, his country home in Kent; and the rest of the year in Kandawela, where he has an estate often described as a Garden of Eden.
In England, the running of his farm took up much of his time. Here in Sri Lanka he lived amid 150 acres of rolling lawns, landscaped gardens and artificial lakes set among woods. After a strenuous game on a fine tennis court, he did cool off in an indoor swimming pool. His stables gave him unending pleasure; in the first few years of his retirement, he enjoyed riding horses, both in England and here.
He loved so much sitting down, after a vigorous game of tennis in the sun-drenched verandah of his mansion sharing reminiscences with old friends of his days who held high office. He was a wonderful teller of anecdotes arousing vulgar or indecent wit and humour which sometimes caused confusion in his political prime, but in retirement, he freely and harmlessly displayed to the enjoyment of his listeners.
International politics
He followed international politics even in his retirementon Vietnam, he declared, If America pulls out within a few years China will over-run South East Asia. Discussing life in general, my own belief he said, is quite simple, what a man sows he reaps: karma, if you wisheither in this life or in the next of his own life he added, I have had a very good innings, and have never regretted a single action. I hope when the end comes I pass away without suffering. I am not afraid of death.
His stories lead one through the great capitals of the globe with spicy illustrations which holds his listeners spell-bound.
He did not have a rigid blueprint for living and believes in no isms. On religion, he said, one must never be fanatical. We cannot say one religion is better than another. I use religion as a guide not as a way of life. But whether he was in Kandawala or Kent his day dawned with Pirith followed by yoga. Almost every other day when in Kandawala he went to Mt Lavinia beach and swam in the sea.
With carefully selected meals, avoiding rice, bread and other starchy foods, he did a daily check on sugar levels and weekly weight check. While he encouraged guests to feast on exotic dishes, he ate salads and cheese. A traditional walk around the estate after breakfast for feeding the pets, black swans, peacocks, deer, elephants, tropical fish, squirrels and birds. And at Brogues Wood, the geese, the mallards, wallabies and goats. They were as much a part of his life like his regular guests, his parties, his afternoon siestas and the convivial drink before meals.
During his political life, he acquired enemies as well as supporters. In his retirement, his circle of friends widened and he enjoyed the status of an elder statesman, shorn of personal ambition and removed from the political fray.
How did he come to terms with himself How could someone formerly so energetic and ambitious subdue the frustrations of public inactivity The answer is he had his own philosophy. no man what we quoted at the beginning of this note.
Sporting activities
If a mans sporting activities are any indication of his age disposition then Sir John must surely be the youngest and happiest national leader in retirement. In his own words: I enjoyed good health and fortune had been kind to me. I use the fortune to enrich my health because without it life is of no value.
Let me conclude this piece with a real happening which the writer himself was involved, without which Sir Johns life after retirement is incomplete. Time, the late 1960splace, Kollupitiya head office of multinational Shaw Wallace & Hedges.
The writer joined them as a trainee and was posted to the foreign liquor division. The company was the agent for most of the popular brands of scotch & cognac from Europe. It was the usual practice for Sir Johns driver cum butler to call over in one of Sir Johns cars that bore registration 5-SRI-5 once a month for two or three cases of Black Label whisky. The citizens of my vintage will remember, that since the SRI series was introduced by the Bandaranaike government in the mid-fifties, the first in the series, 1- SRI -1, a Cadillac, and 2 -SRI-2, 3 -SRI -3 etc. was always registered under Sir Johns name as a special favour by Bandaranaike to his friend.
On one fine day, the writer was climbing up the stairs to meet his manager, when he bumped into the driver of Sir John on the staircase. Guessing that he had come for his Black Label he greeted him and asked, How many cases of Black Label are you ordering today, as our friend ignored him and just grinned away, he repeated the inquiry. Prompt came the reply surprising the writer, No, todayits not Black Labelbut the Fair Label and walked away. Being puzzled by his remark, he related this to his senior colleague, who clarified matters.
I say you are too new to this place young man; we sell not only your divisions stuff to Sir John for which he comes only once a month but more often for the Fair label and that is so and so, and he mentioned the name of a young attractive lady, a junior secretary at this European conglomerate. I guess Sir John was in his early seventies then.
Lionel to his close friends, the former bachelor PM who started the day with Pirith, ended it with Scotch down the drains!
In his last-will, this great son of Sri Lanka left to the country for setting up a defence academy, his Kandawala Estate. He suffered a stroke and passed away on October 2, 1980.

SL has come a long way after rejecting corruption: Incoming US Ambassador

Sri Lanka has come a long way since voters in 2015 rejected the corruption, strife and repression of the past and threw their support behind a reform, reconciliation and accountability agenda, incoming US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives Alaina Teplitz said.
In her testimony to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on June 28 as President Trumps nominee for US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives, Teplitz said, however, the pace of progress on reform and justice has been slow in Sri Lanka.
As anti-Muslim riots in March so painfully demonstrated, the work of mending inter-ethnic and inter-religious fissures remains incomplete, she said. She said Sri Lanka and Maldives are important to the wider security and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region.
Both nations are positioned astride key shipping lanes that connect the Straits of Hormuz and Malacca, the free navigation of which is vital to US economic and security interests. We must also be mindful of the economic and commercial opportunities each country affords, and the importance of working with them to maintain a rules-based international order, she said.
Teplitz, who is the current US Ambassador in Nepal, said the US would continue to support Sri Lankas efforts to make good on its commitments to its people to come to terms with its past, implement justice and accountability measures, and secure a peaceful, prosperous future.
We also support growth of Sri Lankas capacity to make greater contributions to regional stability while protecting its own sovereignty and national interests. Sri Lankas success in this endeavor will make it a stronger partner to the United States and contribute to our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, she said.
If confirmed, Teplitz said she will work in both Sri Lanka and Maldives to advance US values and a shared vision of good governance, transparent economic development, free navigation and commerce, fair and open investment environments and a stable, rules-based regional order

Slaughter of a leopard
And yet there should have been some feeling in Chaudhuri (Nirad) that he had come from another, more primeval world. Every year in his village (and everywhere in Bengal and India) there was celebrated the Durga Puja, five days of prayers and rituals ending with a horrible sacrifice of goats and a water buffalo. Chaudhuri describes the sacrifice lyrically, and it is correct for him to do so since that was how the ritual appeared to him as a child in his village. The poor bleating goat was fixed in a vice; one servant pulled hard on its forelegs, another pulled hard on his hind legs, to make the little animal taut, and then the knife came down on the neck. The head came off and the blood ran, and the priest who had used the knife, wasting no time, put the head with some of the blood in a big plate and offered it at the feet of the goddess Durga- India Again, the Mahatma and after
- VS Naipaul
It was getting towards noon, the height of a hot June day. In the distance, the skies were turning ominously dark, threatening another monsoonal downpour. The heat was terrific. We moved towards the grateful shade of the Nuga tree by the Good Market, for a quick chat.
If Peter finds himself in Colombo on a Saturday he will not miss the Good Market, the citys popular craft, farmers and street food bazaar. After holidaying for nearly two months in Sri Lanka he was booked on a flight to Canada that evening.
I like the atmosphere at the Good Market, clean and orderly, not overcrowded; sometimes you can pick up the odd souvenir of a good quality. Here I can gather my thoughts, ready myself for the long flight, maybe even pick up a good book from Kanages, the bookseller, Peter said sipping his fresh pineapple juice from a long paper cup.
He loves the country, visiting the island at least once every year. It is so different, exotic I would say; easy going people, chaotic environment; there are no firm rules or even thoughts, most things are open to negotiation; connections, influence means a lot. If the correct influence is called upon, any rule can be stretched. Maybe the rule was unfair anyway. They are not institution builders. From what the people tell me, it seems nearly all institutions have lost credibility in this country, failure in one form or the other.
Peter probably is unaware of how deep the deterioration goes, not only does influence get action; the fact is that without influence there will be no action at all! We dont need to look far to see the general breakdown of the institutions we have come to rely on. The underperforming institutions; the ministries, local governments, hospitals, universities, police service, transport services, the list is endless; in daily life, there is no escaping them. Corrupted and politicized, they only distinguish themselves by being an ever heavier charge on public funds every year.
It can be said that the above institutions are based more or less on foreign models, primarily British. In 1978, we made a play at creating institutions on our own; an autochthonous constitution and a somewhat new concept of an executive presidency. (Different in important ways to the presidency of both the US and France, two countries much referred to during the drafting).
In the relatively short period since wide-spread disillusionment has led to so many amendments to the constitution that it is now almost unrecognizable.
The institution of the Presidency is even more controversial. So diminished an office it has become that every incumbent foreswears it-promising to abolish the office no sooner sworn in, only to succumb to its trappings and temptations. And of course, when true greatness cannot be claimed, power structures call upon meaningless pomp and pageantry, which abounds here.
Changing party allegiance
According to our constitution the office of the Prime Minister, apart from being first in a line of succession to the President, plays a key role in the system of governance. His official residence is Temple Trees, the sprawling colonial-era bungalow in Kollupitiya. During the previous government, the President occupied both the Presidents House as well as Temple Trees. So topsy-turvy is our governing mentality that nothing is certain or inviolable, even to the level of location. The Prime Minister could be here, there or nowhere!
We do not know what the country will eventually become, but certain things are in a state of flux all around, incomplete, confused. What is right or wrong, good or bad depends on the circumstances, particularly on whose fortunes are in ascendency then. Today, a Parliamentarian may call himself a social democrat (as the idea is understood generally); concepts like social justice, liberal interpretation, and strong government involvement are bywords of his philosophy.
Tomorrow, todays social democrat can easily become an ultra-conservative or even the very opposite -a Marxist, not because the guy has seen the light, but only because he can become a minister of the government by changing his party allegiance. There are justifications for the jump; I could serve my community, I want to strengthen the hand of the President, so on. As to what he would do the day after, is anybodys guess! There is no sense of a betrayal of self, being untrue is a profitable lifestyle!
Unlike previous farewells, this day I sensed certain sombreness, unease in Peter.
You know last night on TV I watched the slaughter of that leopard in Kilinochchi. It was one of the most shocking scenes of brutality I have witnessed. The animal, fierce it may be, is a national asset of your country. It is a rare and endangered species. Everybody knows that animals live by instinct; they do not have human ways of thinking. Due to deforestation wild animals sometimes stray into human settlements. All over the world, these situations are handled humanely and intelligently. The animals are captured and released into the jungle. Slaughtering the animal is not the answer. What those men did to that wild, beautiful and majestic leopard shook me to the core.
I have met many recent immigrants to Canada from that part of Sri Lanka. We opened our doors for them when the situation in Sri Lanka was rather bad. By and large, they are pious, law-abiding and dutiful. Although Sri Lanka has now returned to normalcy, they have no idea of returning to their land of birth. Refugee status is no longer a political necessity. But having experienced something better; a conscious decision has been made by them to assimilate into that culture, enjoy what life in Canada offers. My interest in these new Canadians made me visit Kilinochchi and other Northern areas. I wanted to see the country they have left behind, how their people live in the native setting.
The land, claimed incrementally from the jungle is mostly flat and arid. Kilinochchi is not large, walking distance to the North or one hundred kilometres East or West you probably will hit the ocean. The inhabitants have developed basic agriculture and several small industries; nowhere near the scale or advancement of Canadian agriculture, but they have learnt to live with what they produce. It would not have been easy. Everything is so difficult in this country; they work on their small farms for crops only slightly above subsistence level. Scrimping, making do with the little they have, there is such an austere quality to everything about them. Then, they had the war, which went on for nearly thirty years.
Shameful moments
The slaughter of the leopard went viral, sickening audiences all over the world. Viewers could hardly believe that in an age with so much awareness of all creatures great and small, an animal of such uncommon grace and strength is destroyed in that manner by a frenzied crowd. Their behaviour was so ugly to watch that it could be said they diminished the idea of humanity by their conduct. We are said to be the only self-conscious species, aware, capable of both observing and judging our own actions. Can the members of that mob, ever watch those shameful moments when they beat to death a cornered leopard with every conceivable weapon they could grab Anyone watching those small immature faces exulting in the thrill of the kill can only reconcile it with crazed savages taken leave of any claim to what is good and noble.
It is not only in northern Kilinochchi that basic instincts rule men. When an accident happens in this country, particularly if there is a fatality or even injuries caused, the gathering, even strangers to the victim, let their fury lose on the vehicle involved! Of course, the smashing of the vehicle destroys the scene of the accident. But it does not worry the mob. It is not taking the offender to justice that is important, but the immediate release of their pent-up instincts.
In recent times, several detainees accused of killing policemen have met sudden death in police custody. Invariably, a deadly weapon ends up in the hands of the prisoner, his guards reacting to the threat posed, shoot the prisoner dead. There is no trial before the law. Yet justice is done.
Was it justice being meted out to that leopard Or did a fearful and cowardly mentality spur the large mob to corner and massacre that single leopard in that manner
I saw the immigrants from Sri Lanka as peaceful and pious. They have also brought something of their country with them to Canada in the form of temples and cultural events. On special days they indulge in many rituals, some of which look arduous. They fast regularly and forego other comforts in the name of god. I am an atheist. In the West, many questions the faiths they were born into. Surely, the truth cannot be determined by the accident of birth.
Nevertheless, I admire the piety and devotion of immigrant cultures. When I came to your country I expected to see a spiritualism that transcends rituals, an awareness that penetrates the appearance. Now, I am not too sure whether it is the other way around, rituals overwhelming everything. I also expected to see a depth of understanding and seriousness of purpose, only to meet a lot of superficiality and frivolity. It is a dilemma how a land of such piety also carry so much failure, anger and violence.

Effie Awards Sri Lanka,organized by SLIM and celebrating its 10th milestone this year is all set to make an indent in the pages of Effie history, by introducing a series of new prerequisites in line with the Global blueprint, that will make a significant impact to this years Awards.
A noteworthy initiative is the eligibility period for Effie 2017 which has been extended from the usual 12 months to 15 months, enabling participants to become prepared with latest results. Accordingly, the new cutoff period would be the end of December 2017.
The number of individuals that can be listed for credits for a winning entry is extended from 6 to 8, counting up to two lead agencies and two clients, especially in the case of joint ventures and joint projects. The number of contributing agencies remain up to 4, as previously.
Another vital addition for this years Effie Awards criteria is the list of new categories introduced. They are Brand Experience, Business to Business (B2B) marketing initiatives and Positive Change - Social Goods. The new categories are listed in the 2017 entry kit which can be accessed via http://www.effie.lk
A series of new standards have also been introduced in the process of judging and evaluation. As per directions from Effie Global, two parallel judging panels will carry-out the judging process in the preliminary round. Thus, the number of entries per judge will be reduced, which would undoubtedly eliminate fatigue, and as a result, enhance their productivity.
Further, according to the newly introduced guidelines, there will be a stringent entry screening process by an eminent panel of marketers prior to judging, to ensure that all entries are qualified as per the entry requirements, which also determine that they are entered into the correct categories.
Speaking about Effie 2017, President SLIM, Pradeep Edward, Chief Executive Officer Lanka Hospitals Diagnostics (Pvt) Limited said, As one of the hallmark events of the marketing industry, widespread participation from both agencies and marketers is imperative to the success of the awards. SLIM is mandated to encourage greater competitiveness and promote inspiring communication campaigns that focus on results allowing the Sri Lankan Advertising industry to showcase work that can compete in the International arena.
The Head of Jury, Tharaka Ranwala, DGM  Consumer Banking, Sampath Bank PLC said, Effie entries are evaluated and scores are allocated to the four key pillars  Strategic challenge / Marcom objectives, Big idea, Bring it to life (execution), and most importantly, Results. The highest weight-age in scoring is attributed to the last pillar, as effectiveness is measured based on this aspect.
He further mentioned A thumb rule in the contest is that a single case can be entered into only one Product and Service category. However, there are no limitations in the number of entries which can be submitted under specialty categories, provided that applicants can correlate the efforts of the campaign to the context defined by the category.
Effie sets itself apart by its benchmark that all submissions are required to be Agency-blind making the whole process unbiased and transparent. Project Chairman, Gayan Perera, Senior Brand Manager, Singer Sri Lanka, said, It is mandatory for agencies not to indicate agency details in any of the entry material. Those who do so even inadvertently will be disqualified. This is an important rule for all those who vie for the awards.
Gayan said, The deadline for early bird entries is 9th July, and we expect most of the entries to flow in before that. Other important deadlines will follow, but it is wiser to prepare ahead and submit entries on time rather than rush at the eleventh hour. This would benefit both the contestants as well as the judging panel.

VIJAYAKALAS speech IN JAFFNA:
Speaker informs AG, PM to hold inquiries
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will hold inquiries on State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwarans statement in Jaffna over LTTE reorganising, Parliament was told yesterday.
Following the uproar in Parliament, the Speaker has written to the Attorney General to take appropriate legal action after investigating as to whether Maheshwaran with her statement had breached any provisions in the Constitution or existing laws.
Parliament heated up yesterday as Government and Opposition members strongly condemned Vijayakala Maheshwarans statement while urging tough action against her.
The Speaker said he would hold a disciplinary inquiry after perusing the video tapes related to the incident.
He said he has already called for reports on the incident and that he would meet the PM and discuss.
Let me follow the required procedure and take appropriate decisions at a Party Leaders Meeting. I am not an authoritarian and I cannot rush through the process. This is a serious issue. The relevant Party has to take a decision, he said.
Speaker Jayasuriya and Leader of the House and Minister Kiriella told the House that the Prime Minister informed that he would hold a special inquiry into the matter and take necessary steps.
The Speaker was forced to suspend and then abruptly adjourn the sittings around 2.25pm following a tense situation created by Joint Opposition members, who stormed into the well of the House, shouting slogans and hurling abuse at the chair.
The concerns on Maheshwarans statement were first raised by UNP MP S.M. Marikkar who questioned what the UNP and Government stances were over it. Maheshwaran has made a traitorous statement that violates the Constitution.We condemn it, he said.
Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, in his capacity as the UNP General Secretary, stated that the UNP completely rejects that statement, adding that he over the phone inquired from Maheshwaran over it. She told me that it was a sudden remark out of her grief over the murder of a six-year old girl in Jaffna. For JO members who are shouting at her remark, I would like to remind that it was no different to the recent Hilter remark, he replied.
MP Marikkar at this point said that it was better to ask her come and obtain treatment at Angoda hospital meant for mental health if she was suffering from shock and grief rather than making such inappropriate remarks. You can directly say it to Maheshwaran replied Kariyawasam.
NFF Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa said Maheshwaran had openly violated the MPs oath by promoting terrorism. She no longer has any right to represent this House he added.
MP Dayasiri Jayasekara, who represents the SLFP Group of 16, called on tough action against her after holding a CID inquiry. She should be banned from coming to Parliament. She was making statements supportive of divisions in the country, he said. UNP MP Asoka Priyantha stated that they were of the opinion that Maheshwaran could not hold any position in the Government after making such a statement. We have suffered immensely due to a brutal war. She should resign from her portfolio, he noted.
The JO members together with MPs of the SLFP 16 Group stormed into the well of the House at this point demanding immediate action by the Speaker against Maheshwaran. MP Weerawansa was leading the JO Group shouting slogans demanding the PM to come to the House and reply to the concerns raised.
The Speaker suspended sittings for 15 minutes amidst chaos. Despite the efforts by the Speaker to proceed on the days business, the JO continued their protest even after the House resumed forcing the Speaker to adjourn sittings till today.
PM Wickremesinghe was seen entering the Chamber at the same time Speaker Jayasuriya announced that the House was adjourned. Parliamentary officials told the Speaker that sittings cannot be resumed after the adjournment and that the Mace was already taken out. The PM had a brief discussion with his group before leaving the main Chamber.
Maheshwaran was not present in Parliament yesterday.

Sweden book place in World Cup
SAINT PETERSBURG: Sweden reached the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time in 24 years after Emil Forsbergs deflected shot earned a scrappy 1-0 win over Switzerland on Tuesday.
This was far from a classic at the Saint Petersburg Stadium and if Colombia or Englands players were watching on from Moscow, they could be forgiven for feeling bullish about their prospects in the last eight.
Switzerlands Michael Lang was sent off in injury-time for a last-ditch push on Martin Olsson and referee Damir Skomina downgraded his penalty to a free-kick on the edge of the area. But the game was already up.
Forsbergs second-half strike, which deflected off the unfortunate Manuel Akanji, means Sweden are through to the World Cup last eight for the first time since 1994 in the United States.
Their route to the quarters has not been easy and, what they have lost in the individual brilliance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, they appear to have gained in grit, determination and collective spirit.
Their next opponents would be foolish to take them lightly.
The one blemish on the victory was a yellow card for defender Mikael Lustig, who will now be suspended for the quarter-final in Samara on Saturday.
Both sides had been hampered by suspensions here too, with Switzerland more badly affected. They were without both Fabian Schaer and captain Stephan Lichtsteiner at the back, prompting Johan Djourou and Lang to come in.
For Sweden, Gustav Svensson replaced Sebastian Larsson in midfield.
After back-to-back penalty shoot-outs, Brazil versus Mexico and Belgiums pulsating comeback against Japan, there was always a danger this last-16 tie would struggle to deliver, even on low expectations.
It was a contest that lacked quality, particularly in the final third, where both teams were often painfully imprecise.
Victor Lindelof slipped on the ball in the first 10 seconds and that set the tone for the first half, which was largely a collection of mishit passes, heavy touches and skewed shots.
There were chances and Sweden had most of them. Marcus Berg blasted over when set free early on and then saw his finish blocked following a poor clearance by Swiss goalkeeper Yann Sommer.
After a slow start, and Lustigs foul on Josip Drmic, Switzerland grew in confidence and should have scored when Blerim Dzemaili snatched at Steven Zubers pull-back.
At the other end, Albin Ekdal was even closer, and completely free, when he sidefooted Lustigs cross over.
Rather than let loose, both teams tightened after the interval, and Forsbergs goal came out of the blue. With space on the edge of the box, his dummy did for Granit Xhaka before the shot was helped in by the outstretched foot of Akanji.
Switzerland twice went close to grabbing an equaliser, as Djourous header dribbled agonisingly across the goal-line and substitute Haris Seferovic drew a late save from close range. AFP

Teachers to fall sick today
Around 241,000 teachers of 14 trade unions around the country will go on strike today (4) against alleged political appointments to the education sector of the country. Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) General Secretary Joseph Stalin speaking to Daily News said they had held discussions with the Prime Minister yesterday evening over the stopping of these political appointments but he had stated that he would have to discuss matters with other parties, before making a decision.
Teachers as a result will go on sick leave today (4) and a protest march from Buddhadasa Stadium in Kaduwela to the Isurupaya Education Ministry in Battaramulla has been organised at 9.30am.
We admit there were those who were politically victimised by the former regime. But they can be given compensation, why are they being given appointments above their grade Teachers are being promoted as principals without a proper exam. We cannot allow the Education sector to be politicised, said Stalin. He further explained that the Education Ministry had planned to make 4,200 political appointments of their supporters soon, They have already received Cabinet and Public Service Commission approval.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam condemned the trade union action stating that several politically motivated trade unions in the education sector are trying to destroy the education system.
These trade unions are going to boycott reporting for duty against the Education Ministry measures to promote 1,011 teachers and principals, who have been subjected to political revenge during the last regime, he said.

Teachers say trade union action is politically-motivated
No one can violate the fundamental rights of students by refraining from educational activities, since students have the right to receive an education, several educationists pointed out with reference to the call for trade union action by some educationists.
Thousands of teachers and principals are expected to report for duty today as usual. Most teachers and principals stressed that they will report for duty, despite a narrow-sighted trade union action calling to boycott duty. They said they do not want to be a cats paw of politically-motivated trade unions, which act on a hidden political agenda.
Responding to some media reports that trade union action is scheduled to take place today against the decision taken by the Education Ministry to promote several education officials, allegedly on the basis of political revenge, many teachers said, according to their knowledge, the teachers are to be promoted after an impartial and transparent procedure.
Speaking to the Daily News, most moderate teachers pointed out that they are duty-bound to educate students and not hamper their education.
If there are issues to be rectified, unions should choose better ways rather than hampering the education system. Moreover, trade union action to boycott duty is a violation of the fundamental rights of students, a female teacher, who serves in a leading school in Colombo, said.
Another male teacher in the Mawanella Education Zone, who requested for anonymity, said many teachers, including the principal, will report for duty today as they dont want to adhere to politically-motivated trade unions.
Meanwhile, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam urged not to sabotage the countrys education system by politicizing it. Refuting some media reports, which claimed that all government schools will be closed today due to trade union action, Minister Kariyawasam confirmed that schools will not be closed today and education activities will be carried out as usual.
All promotions have been done through a proper legal procedure by a committee and only 1,011 officials have been selected from 12,000 applications, said the minister.

THAILAND: Its a scene of joy and relief across Thailand after 12 boys and their football coach were found after being trapped for nine days in a flooded cave.
Relatives who had for days been gathered outside the cave waiting for news cheered as they heard the group had been found by British rescue divers in the Tham Luang cave complex.
Thousands of people have also used social media to celebrate with a hashtag that simply says: 13 Survived.
More than 1,000 people were involved in the extensive search operation, which saw naval divers, military officers and rescue workers band together in the region of Chiang Rai.
Im delighted. I dont know how to describe it in words... its unimaginable, the father of one of the boys said when he heard the news.
Ive been waiting for 10 days. I never imagined this day would come... I just want to see my son and hug him, thats more than enough. Across social media, there was an outpouring of relief and thanks, with many posting with the hashtag #13Survived. Meanwhile, rescuers braced for a long and difficult evacuation for 13 members of a Thai youth football team found alive in a cave nine days after they went missing, as food and medicine was shuttled to them though muddy waters on Tuesday. The 12 young boys and their football coach were discovered rake thin and hungry on a mound of mud surrounded by water late Monday, ending the agonising search that captivated a nation.
But the focus quickly shifted to the tricky task of how to evacuate them safely from the still-flooded caverns. Much-needed food and medical supplies -- including high-calorie gels and paracetamol -- reached them Tuesday as rescuers prepared for a prolonged extraction operation. The Thai military said it is providing months worth of food and diving lessons to the boys to help them out of the waterlogged Tham Luang network in the countrys monsoon-drenched north. (We will) prepare to send additional food to be sustained for at least four months and train all 13 to dive while continuing to drain the water, Navy Captain Anand Surawan said. He refused to say how long they might be trapped, but experts said it could take weeks or even months.
The boys were discovered at about 10:00 pm Monday by British divers some 400 metres (1,300 feet) from where they were believed to be stranded several kilometres inside the cave.
In the video, posted on the Thai Navy SEAL Facebook page, one of the boys asks the rescuers to go outside.
In response the British diver says: No, no not today... many, many people are coming... we are the first, in reference to the vast and complex rescue operation that has taken over the mountainside.

TISL calls for four key amendments to National Audit Bill
The Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) met with key legislators last week to present the legislative brief on the National Audit Bill detailing key amendments to be made in committee stage, ahead of the debate on the Bill, which will commence in Parliament on Thursday (5).
Author of the legislative brief, Attorney-at-Law Maheshi Herat, presented the document to State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne, MP Sunil Handunnetti, the Chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprises and MP Dinesh Gunawardena, the leader of the Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group.
The legislative brief highlights four key areas of concern with the provisions of the existing draft of the National Audit Bill, which have been identified following extensive scrutiny and consultations with stakeholders. These concerns surround the lack of accountability in the surcharging procedure, weaknesses in the appeals process, provisions which curtail the investigative powers of the Auditor General and provisions in contravention of the Right to Information Act.
The National Audit Bill has three key provisions. First the power of surcharge to impose personal financial responsibility on individuals who have caused financial loss to a State entity through fraud, negligence, misappropriation or corruption; second the power to examine bank accounts in which the Auditor General believes that monies belonging to a State entity have been fraudulently, irregularly or wrongfully deposited; and third an independent budgeting mechanism designed to safeguard the independence of the prospective National Audit Office.
The TISL strongly believes that if these amendments are incorporated in the final Act, this will significantly strengthen fiscal accountability in the public sector. The legislative brief can be accessed through www.tisrilanka.org and contains detailed analysis of the issues and suggested amendments.

UNP calls for immediate removal of Maheshwaran
UNP back benchers called on the Party hierarchy to remove UNP State Minister Wijeyakala Maheswaran from her post, owing to her statement that LTTE rule should return to the North.
Convening a press conference immediately after Parliament was adjourned yesterday, UNP MP Heshan Withanage along with MPs Thushara Indunil Withanage and Chaminda Wijesiri, said that the UNP leadership should take swift action.
They collectively condemned Maheswarans statement. We vehemently denounce the shocking remarks made by MP Maheswaran. It is unacceptable that a Parliamentarian, let alone a Government State Minister, made such remarks. Such a person should not be a member of an esteemed party such as the UNP, MP Withanage said.
However, the MP went on to charge that the Joint Opposition was using this incident to shield themselves from the repercussions of the recent New York Times article revealing Chinese funding for former President Mahinda Rajapaksas 2015 Presidential Election campaign.
We condemn the Joint Opposition for attempting to use this issue to protect themselves from the fallout of the New York Times article. They have grabbed this opportunity to distract the masses from their wrong doings, MP Withanage said.
MP Thushara Indunil, observing that MP Prasanna Ranaweera tried to grab the Mace and run, requested the Speaker to take disciplinary action against the MP as per the new Standing Orders of Parliament. The provision to impose eight weeks suspension on any member who touches the Mace during sittings had been included into the new set of Standing Orders adopted since April 15.

Minister Harin Fernando speaking at Sirikotha yesterday said that it is only a personal statement by the State Minister and not the view of the UNP.
The Party Chairman has informed that a disciplinary inquiry will be carried out against the State Minister, Fernando said.
He said that Maheshwaran will address a media briefing on Friday and reveal the reason behind her statement and what she really expected by making such statement.
Both a Hitler from the South and a Prabhakaran from the North will be repudiated by the UNP as they are unwanted, UNP media spokesman Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando said.

Voice  on the  canvas
Priyantha Abeysundara is a voice on Canvas. A voice reminding the modernized youth of Sri Lanka of their unique cultural heritage. Abeysundara calls himself An Observer of Traditional Culture. A picture is worth a thousand words and his portraits provide us with valuable insights into the beauty and simplicity of us islanders. It captures the reality of life and its details and offers us a chance to look back in time at the village and its serenity.
The exhibition is called Swabaavie 3, which is my third exhibition. My paintings are very simple, which has an attraction to many people. This exhibition includes oil paintings, acrylic paintings and line drawings. The themes of these paintings have really nothing to do with modernity, in fact, the paintings feature that which has been lost in Sri Lankan society, specifically from village society and culture. So in doing these paintings, I want to remind and educate the youth of the coming generations of their beautiful heritage. So this is what I will be featuring in my exhibition, said Abeysundara.
Community traits
It could be simple scenes like people farming, gathering at the marketplace or participating in festivals or rituals that we take for granted. These cultural and community traits seem to be disappearing with all these new technological innovations.
It can be simple things like gathering at the well in the village. That has a unique culture of its own which has many facets. This is something we seem to be fast losing in these times. Now, this feature of society is quite a rarity when we look around the environment we are familiar with. This is all fast disappearing even from the villages. These are memories of my childhood that I try to bring on canvas, memories of what I have seen and done as a child. For example, the memory might be of a paddy field in the night, with the bulls working in it, illuminated by the light of the lamps. Remembering this gives me great pleasure, explained Abeysundara.
There is much diversity in Abeysundaras paintings. He goes further and further back in time. To a time very different from Sri Lanka today.
Most of the themes of my paintings revolve around the beauty of Sri Lanka, drawn from my visits to many locations in Sri Lanka. Also, there are certain incidents that have taken place during the times of our kings we have not seen but they have come down through word of mouth. So I bring all of this onto the canvas in the form of paintings, stated Abeysundara.
Canvas process
In the Mahavamsa it says that King Dutugemunu built Ruwanweliseya. Abeysundara has read on this extensively, and on canvas, he takes us through the processes on the site.
My father, Lionel Abeysundara was in this field having worked at Lake House at one time. So I looked at my father when he was drawing, but I must say that I have never studied under him. Possibly this talent of mine is genetic. I must say I did not take studying art very seriously when I was at school. I was much better than all the other students. At school, I was taken in the direction of painting and very soon I fell into that track, it was not something I asked for. So that habit started to become a lifestyle for me very soon.
Then I went to Aesthetic University. I learnt and I learnt well. And then I started to teach there. I was quite skilful and this was evident at my stay at the Aesthetic University winning debates even with my Professors! In 2008, I left and worked as a freelance artist. I did commercial paintings and must have drawn a huge amount of pictures. At a National level, I even proposed that we create 50 sculptures of ancient battles between kings inside a memorial in Tangalle, pointed out Abeysundara.
The only thing greater than his need for Art is his conviction that we have a purpose upon this earth.
Duty and responsibility
I feel we have been born in this world and have been given a certain talent to fulfil a certain need in society. To perform a certain duty and responsibility before we die. Bring a certain balance to the environment, said Abeysundara.
Abeysundara confesses that he likes artists who capture reality. That appeals to him greatly. He has one message to any aspiring artist.
There has to be a certain level of maturity in any good artist. All the great artists have all amassed knowledge and developed their skills through a proper training, mastering the basics and proper techniques. Art should not be about passing exams. It is a vocation. It is about understanding and understanding perspectives. Do it the right way, said Abeysundara.
The exhibition will take place at the Lionel Wendt opening on July 6 and continue till July 9.

West Indies set for two-Test clash with Bangladesh
ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA, Tuesday: West Indies and Bangladesh commence a two-Test series on Wednesday with the hosts expected to continue the trend of greener, bouncier pitches and a pace attack seeking to put the visitors on the back foot from the outset.
Having dropped below the Bangladeshis in the Test rankings to number nine, there is additional incentive for Jason Holders team to win the series which begins in Antigua and move back up to number eight at the expense of their Asian opponents.
With the second Test to follow at Sabina Park in Jamaica a week later, the tourists would have noted carefully the quality of the playing surfaces for the just-concluded three-Test series against Sri Lanka, which ended on a bowler-friendly pitch at Kensington Oval in Barbados.
The Sri Lankans fought back to achieve a series-levelling four-wicket win, the first time a day/night Test was played in the Caribbean and the first time that a team from Asia had ever won a Test match at that famed venue.
Without ace seamer Mustafizur Rahman, who is still recovering from a toe injury, Bangladesh lack the firepower to match what the West Indies are expected to unleash over the two matches.
Shannon Gabriel, who topped all bowlers in the Sri Lanka series with 20 wickets, including a record-breaking 13 in the second match in St Lucia, will spearhead a pace line-up that will also include Holder, who took nine wickets in the defeat at Bridgetown, and the experienced Kemar Roach.
While Devendra Bishoo will again fill the role of specialist spinner, it is felt that all-rounder Keemo Paul will get the nod over the incumbent Miguel Cummins for the fourth and final seamers spot.
In contrast, Bangladesh are relying on the experience of Rubel Hossain to challenge what has proven to be a very vulnerable West Indies top-order batting. It remains to be seen if the uncapped Abu Jayed is given the opportunity to share the new ball in conditions which may actually be encouraging for the 24-year-old.
There is no doubt though that the Bangladeshis main bowling strength at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium will rest in the spin department in the shape of captain and all-rounder Shakib al Hasan, off-break bowler Mehidy Hasan and off-spinning all-rounder Mahmudullah.
Shakib and Mahmudullah are among six players of the present Bangladesh squad with happy memories of their first visit to this part of the cricketing world in 2009 when they dominated the Tests and One-Day Internationals against a West Indies team severely depleted by a standoff between the premier players and the regional administrators.
Their last visit to the Caribbean though, in 2014, was a huge disappointment as the team led by Mushfiqur Rahim was no match for a full-strength home side.
This tour, which also incorporates three ODIs and three T20s, therefore represents an opportunity to show on foreign fields if they have really made meaningful progress after what has generally been a long and trying apprenticeship at the top level of international cricket.
Former captain Rahim, now relieved of wicketkeeping responsibilities, and opener Tamim Iqbal represent the fulcrum of the Bangladesh batting along with Shakib and Mahmudullah.
For the West Indies, the recall of opening batsman Devon Smith after three years off the international scene for the Sri Lanka series proved a failure and he is expected to make way in the final eleven for the first Test for Shimron Hetmyer to return at the number three spot. Kieran Powell is likely to move back up to open the batting with vice-captain Kraigg Brathwaite.
After they were routed for just 93 in the second innings in Barbados  their lowest-ever Test innings total at Kensington  the West Indies batting remains a source of major concern and could be exposed yet again by a varied Bangladesh attack that comes into this series confident that they have the quality to curb the Caribbean batsmen.
Whether their own batsmen can cope effectively with the West Indies pace battery is likely to be the critical factor over the two matches.
Teams: WEST INDIES (probable)  Jason Holder (captain), Kraigg Brathwaite, Kieran Powell, Shimron Hetmyer, Shai Hope, Roston Chase, Shane Dowrich (wicketkeeper), Keemo Paul, Devendra Bishoo, Kemar Roach, Shannon Gabriel.
BANGLADESH (probable)  Shakib al Hasan (captain), Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Mominul Haque, Liton Das (wicketkeeper), Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah, Mehidy Hasan, Taijul Islam, Rubel Hossain, Abu Jayed. - AFP

Worlds largest causa
Two universities in Peru have set a new Guinness World Record for the largest causa, a traditional Peruvian dish that typically contains potatoes, egg, shrimp and avocado.
The schools, Universidad San Ignacio Loyola S.A. and Universidad Nacional de San Antonio Abad del Cusco, worked 12 hours together to complete the causa, which weighed in 590.65 kilograms or 1,302.16 pounds, beating the minimum by more than 100 kilograms.
The causa also contained carrots, peas, beans and was garnished with hopped pepper, slices of olives and parsley. The base featured a mixture of yellow potatoes and cornmeal.
The causa was served on a stainless steel tray that was five meters long and 1.5 meters wide. An event was held where attendees finished the food within hours.
We are truly proud to have achieved this record for Cusco and for Peru. With this activity we seek to promote the consumption of Peruvian potatoes on all continents, a food rich in energy, with multiple nutritional properties and diverse uses, Ral Diez Canseco Terry, founder and president of Universidad San Ignacio Loyola said in a statement.
The school previously broke the Guinness World Record for largest serving of quinoa, largest serving of rocotos rellenos and largest olive salad. UPI
