007 Spectre coming in November
James Bond returns and he's welcome back to Sri Lanka anytime! "Spectre" opens in cinemas in Sri Lanka on November 6 same day with USA.
Audiences in Sri Lanka have always loved James Bond ... from Sean Connery in Dr. No to Moonraker with Roger Moore right up to Skyfall with the ever so dangerous and seductive Daniel Craig. There's been a following on this island that would rival anywhere else in the world! As 007 returns, you know "Spectre" will play out to packed theatres of Bond fans around the island.
This movie is brought to you in Sri Lanka by Liberty Lands and Development who have been appointed by Tanweer Group, a leader in theatrical content distribution.
"We always go to any lengths to get the best of international movies for our audiences in Sri Lanka. We believe it's crucial to have these movies in theatres on same dates as international launches so as to keep our enthusiastic viewers happy", Liberty Lands and Development Managing Director Imthiaz Cader stated.
Cader elaborates that the movie going culture in Sri Lanka is one that craves every next global release with the hype for Spectre already evident on social media.
Spectre promises to be brimming with excitement. A cryptic message from the past sends James Bond played by Daniel Craig to Mexico City and Rome, where he meets the beautiful widow played by Monica Bellucci of an infamous criminal. After infiltrating a secret meeting, 007 uncovers the existence of the sinister organization SPECTRE. Needing the help of the daughter of an old nemesis, he embarks on a mission to find her. As Bond ventures toward the heart of SPECTRE, he discovers a chilling connection between himself and the enemy he seeks.
As with every Bond movie, expect those nail-biting elements that keep you frozen in front of the screen from cracking great chases on difficult terrain to treacherous enemies that use every weapon to terrorize and loyalties that won't die. As he destroys the most daunting threats, James Bond, this character of Ian Fleming's imagination surpasses any other we have ever known.
Actors Andrew Scott, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Director Sam Mendes, Lea Seydoux, Daniel Craig, Monica Belluci, Christoph Waltz, Ben Whishaw, Dave Bautista and Rory Kinnear pose for photographers at the announcement for the new Bond film, the 24th in the series, at Pinewood Studios in west London, Thursday, December 4, 2014.

Al-Jazeera journalists walk free in Egypt after Sisi pardon
EGYPT: Two Al-Jazeera journalists walked free after being pardoned Wednesday along with scores of others by Egypt's president, following criticism of his government for jailing opponents.
The release of Canadian Mohamed Fahmy and colleague Baher Mohamed was welcomed by their supporters, with Al-Jazeera saying it was "delighted" and Fahmy's lawyer Amal Clooney calling it "a historic day".
The 100 prisoners pardoned by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi included women activists Sana Seif and Yara Sallam, the president's office said, in a goodwill gesture on the eve of a major Muslim holiday.
The move came a day before Sisi is due to head to New York to deliver a speech at the UN General Assembly. Within hours of the announcement, Fahmy and Mohamed were dropped off by authorities in the upmarket Cairo suburb of Maadi in their blue prison uniforms.
They told an AFP correspondent on the spot that they were looking forward to being reunited with their families.
"I'm feeling ecstatic knowing that I don't have to worry about lawyers, police officers following me all over the place and knowing that I'm going to share my apartment tonight with my beloved wife," said Fahmy.
"Now we're free, me and (my wife) Marwa are going to celebrate. We're going to go back to Canada and travel and... get on with our lives."
Mohamed said: "We're very, very happy. But we're a bit surprised about how it was done.
"I can live a normal life with my family, with my children. The whole nightmare is over finally. Thank God." - AFP

Bring back the HANGMAN and the WHIP
The latest gruesome rape and murder of this young child has indeed shocked our nation. This horrible crime MUST be avenged for its own sake and also for the security of our people. Those responsible have no right to live till the end of their days eating and living at our expense in prison serving life terms; believe me - I was the Chairman of a Prison Inspection Committee, these despicable scoundrels who have been sentenced to death for murder but not been hanged lead a good life inside - a life they no right to after having taken the life or lives of others.
Not a day passes when we do not read of some horrendous murder or of a child being molested or a woman being raped and murdered and of horrific murders at times of whole families (the murder of the Harmer family of Dehiwela by contract killers is just one such instance); the convicted killers are happily living in jail being fed, clothed and maintained at our expense, like a few hundred others. The wretched man convicted of being a party to the murder of the great Neelan Tiruchelvam when asked by me, when he was an inmate of the Kalutara prison, as to whether he regretted that he was a party to the murder of a great man, he laughed, he had no regret and we continue to allow him to live and pay for him to live!!. Are we not ashamed that such things are happening and that the situation is getting worse by the day.
War against crime
No one can deny that there had been an almost complete breakdown of law and order in our country. We have never had such a situation before and this reflects badly on us all, yes it is a sad reflection on the people and the country which boasts of a two thousand five hundred year old civilization.
Why is it that our neighbours such as Singapore and Malaysia do not face this unfortunate situation In the first instance it is because both countries have retained the death penalty and have punishments to fit the crime. The death penalty is indeed a deterrent. Both countries are also free of the drug menace which has ruined our society with political leaders being drug barons and acting with impunity.
Should not our new government not act NOW. Yes let us act now and not postpone, this should be the motto of our new government if it wishes to make our country safe for us from criminals, but the government cannot do this alone our religious leaders, our school teachers, parents most importantly and all other social groups and most importantly the media should join in this war against crime, we have duty by our country to do this.
Hang the killers
When a court of law orders the death penalty and after the appeals are over, the final order to carry out the sentence must NOT be passed on to the President, the Supreme Court (a bench of three Justices) should order the execution and set the date and time for it; a citizens group could ensure that the Supreme Court order is carried out. If hanging is considered gruesome let us introduce the Syringe as is the practice in many States of the US and in some other countries, those who have taken the lives of others MUST pay with their lives. Today killing a human being is given out to contract killers --- we must put an end to this horrific practice and there is only one way of doing this ---hang the killers.
As for the child molesters and rapists, public lashing is not the only appropriate punishment they must be castrated and one hand amputated so that the public would recognize a rapist when they see one and our Judiciary should have no compunction in ordering such a punishment for fear and shame are indeed deterrents. Let us also have the death sustenance as in Malaysia, Singapore and some other countries for the Drug kings who are poisoning our youth in particular.
The progeny of those who committed the most atrocious mass murders in our countries during the colonial period and more recently in the world during the first and second World Wars, dropped Atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing thousands of innocent civilians and are today setting the Middle East on fire to sell their weapons and to control the oil reserves, are preaching to us to do away with capital punishment, let us tell them in no uncertain terms that we were civilized over 2500 years ago when their ancestors were living in caves and that we do not need their advice to manage our affairs.
Here's hoping that our new President, the Prime Minister and his Cabinet and Parliament along with the Judiciary will act now without any further delay to save our country from disaster.

[Cross Currents]
Of crime, politicians and mafia
The murder of six year old Seya Sedewmi has stirred the conscience of the people. Demonstrations calling for the speedy arrest and maximum punishment for the offenders have sprang up in many localities including the Capital city.
This is not the first of such horrendous crimes. Unfortunately it may not be the last too. Similar demonstrations took place after the serial killing of women at Kahawatta, Ratnapura and the rape and murder of schoolgirl Sivalogan of Jaffna. Usually such public anger and public demonstrations wane off with the passage of time and the incidents are forgotten. Politicians and law enforcing officers also make bold pronouncements loaded with good intentions and a bit of blowing their own trumpets. As usual the story ends there.
Prison officials
Such incidents should be an eye-opener to look deeply into the escalation of horrendous crimes and their links with the political hierarchy and state apparatus, especially with the law-enforcement officials.
Just take a quick look at some of the recent news reports. A high-ranking police officer was taken into custody for providing security to treasure hunters. Several prison officials were interdicted after it was established that they have provided an outsider facilities to visit a drug offender inside the lock-up at the Courts Complex at Hulftsdorp, Colombo. Several army and police officials are in custody over abductions and intimidation of persons. Public perception is that only 10 percent of narcotics are nabbed by Customs and 90 percent escape being detected, apparently due to negligence or collusion with drug lords. Unfortunately narcotics and other drugs confiscated and handed over to the police get evaporated into thin air and only a fraction of the confiscated amount reaches the Courts.
Another disturbing factor is the collusion of local as well as national politicians in criminal activities. The number of politicians arrested or charged with such crimes as assault, rape and intimidation are countless.
The unfortunate phenomenon is that such politicians are never punished by their respective parties and they obtain nomination for subsequent elections. Strangely enough they get elected, even heading the preferential votes pointing to utter indifference of the public to the morality of the candidates. It is as if the public too have lost their conscience or sold it for a mess of porridge.
Politico-underworld link
A keen observer could also witness a nexus between the underworld mafia and the politicos. Corrupt politicians provide a climate of impunity to the criminals and the hapless public can do nothing except keeping their mouths shut in fear of reprisals from the offenders.
This politico-underworld link has a direct influence in corrupting the state officials to become willing partners in covering-up many a serious crime.
If such is the case in ordinary crimes one could imagine how far more complex the nexus between politicians, criminals and corrupt state officials would be in case of large-scale economic and financial crimes. In this situation the lethargy shown by officials in proceeding with investigations against highly placed politicians, especially those of the last regime and the lame excuses given by persons in authority for their inaction does not give any confidence to the public that justice will be done. Many have already lost hope as most of those against whom there are allegations have secured important Cabinet and other portfolios that enable them to influence the investigations.
The present government as well as some of its predecessors have time and again pointed to the shortcomings in the criminal justice system that facilitates criminals to take advantage of such shortcomings. However, legal reform is a slow process. Due to its elitist and technical nature the intricacies of the legal system are beyond the comprehension of the ordinary public and hence there is no public agitation for legal reform. This factor alone contributes to the conservatism and inertia in the legal system. The Government must without delay initiate a process of legal reform so that international pressure on it could be considerably reduced.
One could recall in this context the conclusion arrived at by the Human Rights Council of the United Nations now sitting in Geneva that the Sri Lankan judicial system is not adequate to inquire into serious allegations of human rights violations that are supposed to have taken place during the civil war in the country. One has to admit that this conclusion is true, even though political motivations may have prompted its authors to arrive at it.
The Human Rights Council comprises States parties and each State party has its own national agenda and national interest. We cannot blame them for acting thus. However, the Sri Lankan State too must act on its own national agenda and national interest. In assessing the national interest it is not sufficient to consider only the internal situation. The international situation and primarily, Sri Lankas role as a responsible member of the international community must be taken into account.
International inquiry
As regards the issue under consideration by the Human Rights Council it is best that Sri Lanka investigates on its own the allegations made in the Council Report. It is in the national interest to do so since an international inquiry would erode the sovereignty of the State. To investigate and punish the offenders and establishing norms of conduct that bar any repetition of such incidents is the only way of achieving national reconciliation and stable peace. In view of the above mentioned deficiencies in the Sri Lankan judicial system it is apparent that international assistance may be required to update it to modern global standards, especially with regard to protection of victims and witnesses. However, the question of how far one can go in involving foreign jurists in any domestic investigative mechanism has to be tackled with care so as not to transgress national sovereignty.
The exact nature of the resolution that would be passed by the UNHRC is yet to be seen. The more resolute the Sri Lankan delegation in pursuing the national interest without being cajoled by powerful States the easier it would be to implement it.

Instagram tops 400 million users
US: Instagram has rocketed past the 400-million-user mark, with more than 80 million pictures shared daily at the Facebook-owned service.
The number of people sharing pictures and videos each month using Instagram soared from 300 million at the start of this year and tops the number of people using Twitter monthly by nearly 100 million.
"While milestones like this are important, what really excites us is the way that visual communication makes the world feel a little bit smaller to every one of us," Instagram said in a blog post.
"Instagrammers continue to capture incredible photos and videos from all corners of the Earth (and even the solar system)."
More than half of the last 100 million people to join Instagram live in Europe or Asia, with Brazil, Japan, and Indonesia seeing the strongest growth, according to the service.
The list of high-profile new Instagram users who quickly won legions of followers included David Beckham, Caitlyn Jenner and footballer Toni Kroos.
Earlier this month, Instagram unveiled plans to expand its offerings to advertisers, opening up possibilities for global marketing efforts on the photo-sharing network.
The expansion is intended to allow advertisers to launch global campaigns in a variety of formats including video ads of up to 30 seconds.
Instagram, which was acquired by Facebook in 2012, has had only limited advertising opportunities up to now.
In 2013, it began with a small number of "sponsored" posts by well-known brands such as Michael Kors and Adidas.
The new system could help Instagram generate considerably more revenue.
Instagram also introduced a service called Marquee, a "premium" advertising product aimed at driving mass awareness in a short time-frame for events like movie premieres and new product launches.
Industry tracker eMarketer estimates that Instagram's worldwide ad revenue this year will grow rapidly, hitting $600 million. - AFP

Ivanovic launches Pan Pacific campaign
Defending champion Ana Ivanovic survived a brave challenge from Italian Camila Giorgi on Thursday at the Pan Pacific Open, managing a tough 7-5, 6-2 victory.
The victory put the Serb second seed in a quarter-final against Dominika Cibulkova in a rematch of the US Open where Ivanivic was ousted by the Slovak.
In Tokyo, Ivanovic struggled to keep full control of the match particularly during the first set when she suffered five double faults, as Giorgi fired a succession of big serves and deep returns to keep their gap within close margins.
In the second set, Giorgi led 2-0, as the world number-12 Ivanovic vented her frustration.
Later, however, Ivanovic snapped back winning the next six straight games and the set 6-2 in one hour and 39 minutes.
"I am very happy to have the victory because it was a very, very tough match," said Ivanovic, who won the Tokyo event last year by beating Caroline Wozniacki in the final.
The Dane is also here to regain the trophy that she lifted in 2010 and is the top-seed this year.
"She (Giorgi) has been playing very well, hitting the balls very deep. I had to stay low and she generated a lot of power on ground strokes as well as serves," Ivanovic said.
The Serb said she was eager to fight Cibulkova after the US Open.
"I really feel like I am ready for revenge. I had great preparation. I really did everything possible to get in shape," she said.
"Hopefully, I can get the better of her this time," she said.
In other matches, Agnieszka Radwanska, 2011 Pan Pacific winner, cruised by Elina Svitolina with a 6-4, 6-1 victory.
In a quarter-final, the seventh-seed Pole will face fourth-seed Czech rising star Karolina Pliskova, who beat Kurumi Nara of Japan 6-2, 6-4.
Radwanska won all of their three previous matches.
Cibulkova beat sixth-seed Carla Suarez Navarro 6-4, 6-4. AFP

Matale Thomians take on S. Thomas' Mount Lavinia in hockey Big Match
The hockey town of Matale will go gay on Saturday (September 26) when the inaugural schools hockey big match between St Thomas College Matale, and S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia sponsored by the Nations Trust Bank is played at the Edward Park, Matale at 4.30 pm. This will be preceded by the Thomian Walk from the Matale Thomians School to the venue of the match.
The Matale Thomians known for their prowess in hockey should have the edge but the Mount Lavinia Thomians famous for what is known as the 'Thomian grit' will fight every inch of the way. For the record the Matale boys ended up as the losing semi finalist at the recently concluded National School Games Hockey championship 2015.
Hockey is the forte of the Matale Thomians while the boys from the school by the sea are reputed for cricket, rugby and other games like table tennis and badminton.
The exact date of introduction of hockey to Matale is not known and the 'doyen of hockey' in this country P Thyangavelu told this correspondent that this game was introduced in the thirties by late P T Rajan, late M S Jainudeen and himself. The game took wings and flew high under late George Mant a bus magnate whose love for hockey knew no bounds. Of the trio P Thangavelu is still with us almost 90 years of age. The first hockey ground was constructed in 1957 when Edward Silva was the Mayor of Matale and the 2nd Hockey Nationals was staged there.
A little history about the two schools. St Thomas Matale was founded in 1873 A D initially it had on roll 75 boys and 17 girls. Emmanueld was its first head master and the school was run with the funds from the Church. The staff had just four members.
Three years later a major change was brought about and the school was separated with a Girls section started named St Agnes Convent. In 1897 the school gained the status of Assisted school from the Government. The main hall of the school was built between 1901 and 1924.
The school took a giant step forward when that legendary figure Charles Robinson was appointed Principal in 1923. In 1936 the game of hockey was introduced.
Charles Robinson served as Principal of the school for 35 years till his retirement in 1958. A tall figure clad always in coat and tie was seen even after his retire taking his constitutional walk from Hulangamuwa to Matale town. Since then many Principals had served the school. In the early sixties the school was taken over by the State. The present Principal is Dampi Wanasinghe.
St. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia is an Anglican Church School which was founded by the first Bishop of Colombo Rt. Rev. James Chapman D D. It was his foremost vision to build a College and Cathedral for the new Diocese of Colombo of the Church of Ceylon. The school was founded in 1851 and named St Thomas College and was a private fee levying school. It has one of the most beautiful school campus in Sri Lanka.
In the sphere of sports the Mount Lavinia Thomians have made giant strides. It built the first swimming pool in the country, which was a gift from Dr R L Hayman in 1933. It has two playing fields known as the Big Club and Small Club. Over the years the school introduced cricket, rugby, hockey, soccer, athletics, volleyball, basketball, tennis and swimming. The sports complex was completed in 1996 to house table tennis, badminton and three glass back squash courts coupled with a most modern gymnasium.
The annual big match (cricket) against Royal College is the oldest in the island and perhaps one of the oldest in the world. Rowing also takes a high place in sports.
Over the years some of the national hockey players produced by the Matale Thomians are the famous Wijekoon brothers, Herbert, Ranjith and Chandra, Dr R Mahendra, G H Rupasinghe, G H Jayatissa, M Rajanathan, S Selvakumar, A Costs, Ranjith Alahakoon just a name a few from the long list.
The Mount Lavinia Thomians have produced the Abeynaike brothers, Isha, Sahabdeen, J D Bandaranaike, Michael Tissera, Dr Jayantha Seneviratne from the long list.

Mount Lavinia Hotel partners with CMF once again
Mount Lavinia Hotel is the chosen venue once again for the 27th Country Roads concert organised by the Country Music Foundation. Riding on the success of the show last year, the organisers are keen on staging one of the best country music concerts of the year.
"We are pleased to join CMF as venue sponsors for one of South Asia's longest running musical events for children. Throughout the years, the funds from Country Roads has brightened the lives of many a child and we are obviously proud to be part of it. Our Team is dedicated in going into detail to re-create the ambiance befitting the concert," Mount Lavinia Hotel Resident Manager Harinda Weerasinghe stated.
MLH, the ideal venue with its old-world charm will be transformed into the rustic country ranch atmosphere complete with stabled horses, old Western tavern-like bars, and cowboy outfits.
In addition, the hotel will also be home to two of the main performers, the German group the Mavericks and British country singer Astrid Brook, throughout their stay in Sri Lanka.
The signature event would be the exclusive charity dinner hosted by Country Music Foundation and Mount Lavinia Hotel on the preceding night where guests will be entertained by some of the performers over dinner as they share their passion for country music and their contribution to the betterment of children through their association with CMF.
"The Mount Lavinia hotel with its old world charm and spacious ballroom is our home for the third time. What makes the hotel on the hill an excellent venue is its team striving to make every country show better than the previous one and, once again this year, working in sync with the Country Roads team to make the show memorable", Country Music Foundation President and Co-founder Feizal Samath stated.
Organised by the Country Music Foundation, the Country Roads concert series has, to date, raised several million rupees for Sri Lanka's needy children. From mother and child friendly initiatives related to clean water, dengue prevention (mosquito nets) and plantation workers, to funding libraries, schools and child-friendly courts, this concert series has passed on all its proceeds to many child-related causes over its 27 years. Tickets are available at Mount Lavinia Hotel.

Obama, Pope unite for action on migrants, climate
US: President Barack Obama and Pope Francis married their political and spiritual power to urge action on immigration and the environment Wednesday, during the popular pontiff's maiden White House visit.
America's first black president offered the first Latin American pope a stately and effusive welcome on the South Lawn, praising his moral leadership on issues that politics have struggled to address.
"I believe the excitement around your visit must be attributed not only to your role as pope, but to your unique qualities as a person," Obama said, praising Francis's humility, "embrace of simplicity" and generosity of spirit.
Though Pope Francis has inveighed against the materialism that the United States seems to embody like no other country, he is also a potential political ally for Obama, sharing many of his progressive goals and bringing along many of America's 70 million Catholics.
Speaking in fluent, if accented, English, the 78-year-old Argentine pontiff returned the warm blessings of his host and addressed Washington's bitter debate about immigration reform.
"As the son of an immigrant family, I am happy to be a guest in this country, which was largely built by such families."
Francis said he would address Congress "to offer words of encouragement to those called to guide the nation's political future in fidelity to its founding principles."
Obama lauded Francis for reminding the world that "the Lord's most powerful message is mercy."
"That means welcoming the stranger with empathy and a truly open heart, from the refugee who flees war-torn lands to the immigrant who leaves home in search of a better life," Obama said. That joint message may also resonate strongly in Europe, which has been convulsed for months by an ongoing refugee crisis. And as many US conservatives question the very existence of man-made climate change, Francis and Obama made a de facto joint appeal for action on the issue.
"Holy Father, you remind us that we have a sacred obligation to protect our planet, God's magnificent gift to us," Obama said. Francis took up the call.
"Accepting the urgency, it seems clear to me also that climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation," Francis said.
"When it comes to the care of our 'common home,' we are living at a critical moment of history."
He also invoked Obama's hero Martin Luther King Jr, saying, "We have defaulted on a promissory note, and now is the time to honour it."
The pope was afforded a full ceremonial welcome and a 40 minute one-on-one meeting with Obama in the Oval Office.
Obama himself had made an exceedingly rare ceremonial trip to the airport to meet the Argentine's plane Tuesday, bringing his wife, daughters, Vice President Joe Biden to underscore the special welcome. - AFP

Obama, Xi must do more than agree to disagree - Jimmy Carter
US: Former US president Jimmy Carter has said that Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama must use their meeting later this month to do more than simply agree to disagree on many issues.
I was governor of Georgia when president Nixon made his historic visit to China in 1972, and was disappointed when no additional moves were made to establish diplomatic relations between our two countries, Carter wrote in an article for the People's Daily.
I set this as a high priority when I became president, and initiated high-level negotiations with Chinese leaders. These efforts became successful when Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping and I announced on December 15, 1978, that full mutual recognition would take place at the beginning of the next year, he said.
Deng Xiaoping announced three days later that dramatic reforms would take place in his country, and that it would be opened up. Few people anticipated how these two decisions would so drastically affect the global community, said Carter.
Since leaving office, I have made regular visits to China, and have been welcomed by its top political leaders, those in the private sector, and by private citizens in many communities.
The Carter Center has been asked by the government to perform important duties, including the implementation and assessment of fully democratic elections in Chinas 600,000 villages, which include almost two-thirds of the population. Carter is the founder of the non-profit Carter Center, which works to advance peace and health worldwide.
During my four visits with President Xi Jinping in recent years, he has stressed, like Deng Xiaoping before him, the need for our political leaders to respect each other in spite of the dramatic differences in our history, culture and political systems, the former US president said.
It has always been clear that in both countries there are potential political leaders who, for their own benefit, have blamed the other country for domestic problems and tried to exacerbate the inherent differences that always exist.
Like the US, China is facing many serious domestic challenges.
China is struggling to shift from a relatively burgeoning economy based on exports to one that is accommodating increasing dependence on domestic consumers.
Unlike in the past, its political and economic impact is felt in almost every corner of the globe, he said.
China has remained at peace with its neighbours and others for the past 35 years, but its expansion of influence has brought it into contention, especially relative to its southern and eastern seas.
Although many of my successors as president have made negative comments about relations with China during their campaigns, almost all of these have been moderated when they were elected to our nation's top office. I am sure the same situation has existed in China. THE NEW INDIAN EXPRESS

Open Day and Home Economics Workshop
The Open Day of the Colombo Academy of Hospitality Management (CAHM @ SLIIT) was held on last week where the students and lecturers of the Academy geared up to show the public the facilities at CAHM and the benefits of joining the world of hospitality.
This day was filled with demonstrations and stations from napkin folding to wine tasting and the general public who attended the event had a taste of the food and drinks the students made; they were escorted around the campus and was educated with the courses that are available here at CAHM. There were past students who attended the event and they spoke to people who had queries and simply wanted to know about student life at CAHM.
There was quite a turn out as the main attraction for the day was the Culinary Arts Competition, organized by the CAHM kitchen. The objective of hosting such an event was in order to send one out of twelve students who participated to Kolkata, India to take part in the "Young Chef Olympiad Competition 2016" to represent the country. We at CAHM are proud to be the only hospitality institute that will take part in this well celebrated competition.
The esteemed judging panel comprised of Gourmet Circle Editor Narmada Muller, DIF Chairman and Managing Director Danu Innasithamby, CAHM CEO Steven Bradie-Miles and CAHM Past student Harsha Alahakoon who represented Sri Lanka at the "Young Chef Olympiad Competition" in 2015.
The students are introduced to the Culinary Arts aspect of the curriculum in the Certificate IV stage. Twelve students from Certificate IV, Diploma and Advanced Diploma took part in the Culinary Arts Competition where Weenu Winfried Braun from Certificate IV won first place and the opportunity of representing Sri Lanka and CAHM in Kolkata, India. In second place Geema Wijeyasiri from the Diploma batch received an award and in third place from the Advanced Diploma batch Johanne Rodrigo won an award.
The students who took part in this competition are completely new to the art of cooking but they have been guided by Chef Kapila Jayanetti and Surene, both lecturers at CAHM. A Culinary Arts Competition will mould a student in growing up to be professionals for themselves, as a team and also to the industry as a whole. Taking part in competitions such as "Young Chef Olympiad" is an experience of its own to aspiring chefs of the future as it increases creativity and brings opportunities to experiment with new ideas and products whilst sharing and gathering concepts.
The 10th Home Economics workshop was held at the Colombo Academy of Hospitality Management (CAHM) where the Academy invited the following schools - St. Anne's Wattala, Bandarawatta Mahavidyalaya Gampaha, Sri Seevali Mahavidyalaya Gampaha, Sri Rathnapala Mahavidyala Wattala, Karunaratne Buddhist College, Chandrajyoti Mahavidyalaya, Anura Mahavidyalaya Yakkala, Good Shepherd Balika Mahavidyala, Heenkenda Mahavidyalaya Ragama, Bandarawatta Parakrama Mahavidyalaya, Embaraluwa Mihindu Mahavidyalaya, Yashodara Devi Balika Vidyalaya Gampaha and Keerthipola Mahavidyalaya Minuwangoda as a CSR initiative to educate them on Hospitality and the Tourism industry.
This session was for over hundred students from schools in Wattala and Gampaha.

Keep it Simple
Passionate take on home ware
Have you ever wanted to work a full-time job and simultaneously make money out of your passion If you think this is not possible, think again. This is exactly what Dinusha Gomez did. A full-time working mom, not only does she manage a household with two toddlers but also an online concept store that sells exclusive home ware.
Dinusha notes that her concept store, "Keep it Simple" was one that was purely driven by passion. The store, which offers a range of home ware products, is showcased via her social media pages, including facebook.com/keepitsimplelk.
"I have always been passionate about decorating. Keep it Simple, as it is today, began when I was organising some events and realised that I was unable to get hold of the items I wanted and even when I did, it was not within the budget I had in mind," Dinusha said.
Keep it Simple primarily operates through social media channels, Instagram and Facebook. Most of the products are very minimalist and either sourced from travels or made in Sri Lanka.
Dinusha, as an aspiring entrepreneur herself is keen on contributing towards uplifting lives of new, budding entrepreneurs and smallholders. She explains that in future, she ideally expects to employ women and mothers who have specific skill-sets and are capable of creating crafts and decorative items.
"The main reason why I would want to employ women who are mothers is because, as a mother with two toddlers, who has a full-time job, I know how difficult things can get trying to manage everything at work, home and doing what you love. I would want to employ mothers who can work during the day while the kids are at school and have them leave for the day by the time school's over," she added.
At present, she already has collaborated with women who design and create home ware, decorative and other creative products that align with the store's minimalist style. She also goes on to say that while she does have big plans for the store, having a physical store is not a priority.
Dinusha explains that if she were to have a physical store, overheads will considerably increase and thereby, she will not be able to maintain the prices she has now, as they too will subsequently increase. She also goes on to say that having a store will remove the distinct quality of the products being unique and one-of-a-kind. She explains how besides the mason jars, which are forever in constant demand, nothing else comes in bulk.
Dinusha's inclination towards interior design is an inherited one. Not only does she do a fair share of event styling and party planning along with her Mother who runs a small but delicious home bakery, "Aunty Maureen's Cakes and Bakes", but also has a Father who is a creator and builder himself and what's more, is married to a creative from the advertising industry as well.
The success of Keep it Simple, a little less than a year in operation has been positively contagious. Dinusha explains that the responses have been encouraging and a majority has turned into recurring customers.
Apart from quality and unique home ware products, the site also provides services in home styling, designing, and even party and event planning. If unique, minimalistic products are what you have in mind, visit Dinusha's instagram page on instagram.com/minimal.simple or give her a call on 0773002274.

Photographer worked for 66 years and never took a sick day
US: The top of Timothy Hyman's desk is barely visible, with piles of head shots of current and former state employees scattered across it. Enlarged photos of highways, bridges and intersections throughout the state of Maryland are taped to his office walls.
The pictures are just a few of the thousands taken by Hyman, the staff photographer for the Maryland State Highway Administration for more than a half-century.
Hyman, who will turn 78 next week, retires this month as the state's longest-serving employee. For 60 years, Hyman has focused on Maryland history in the making, documenting the construction of roadways, snapping pictures of more ribbon-cutting ceremonies than he can remember and capturing on film (and, more recently, digitally) the state's changing transportation landscape.
Gov. Larry Hogan honored Hyman this month for not only his years in state government but also his commitment to his job. In his 66 years of working for the state, Hyman never took a sick day.
"Tim Hyman is truly an inspiration to us all," Hogan said as he presented Hyman with a proclamation for his retirement at a Board of Public Works meeting on Sept. 16. The relics of six decades in state government fill Hyman's small corner office in a state office park not far from Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport.
Taped to the wall near his door is a copy of a 1963 photo of President John F. Kennedy participating in a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Interstate 95, near the Delaware line, with Maryland Gov. Millard Tawes and Delaware Gov. Elbert Carvel. The photo was taken days before Kennedy's assassination.
Packing up his belongings one recent day, Hyman pulled a file from his desk drawer that contained a program for the Eastern Region Military-Civilian Safety Conference at the Statler Hilton of Annapolis. It was dated 1969.

Pressure on Argentina to beat Georgia
Argentina will bid for their first World Cup victory in a bid to nail down second place in Pool C when they take on Georgia in Gloucester on Friday.
The Argentinans pushed champions New Zealand all the way before falling to a 26-16 defeat in their opening match, the All Blacks expected to run away as winners of a pool also featuring Tonga and Namibia.
Georgia, however, kicked off their campaign with an impressive 17-10 win over Tonga, meaning the pressure is on the South Americans to confirm their status as the pool's second favourites behind the All Blacks.
Argentina coach Daniel Hourcade made three changes from the side that lost to the champions.
Matias Alemanno replaced injured lock Guido Petti, who suffered a head knock in scoring a try against the All Blacks, while back-row forwards Facundo Isa and Juan Manuel Leguizamon have come in for Leonardo Senatore and Pablo Matera respectively. Argentina captain Austin Creevy said "it will be a big battle in the scrum and the mauls".
"They are very strong and we have got to impose rhythm and dominate the game with our fowards to offer up some clean, quality ball for our backs."
Georgia coach Milton Haig, whose last encounter, in 2013, with Argentina ended in a 29-18 defeat agreed that his team were the underdog against the Pumas, just as they were against Tonga.
"The difference between the Tonga and Argentine side is that Tonga were ranked 12th in the world whereas Argentina are ranked eighth, and they play in the Rugby Championship every year and have got some very good quality players," said Haig, a Kiwi.
"I'm not saying that Tonga don't, but Argentina will be a different kettle of fish."
Haig added: "It's a nice opportunity for us this time because there's no pressure on Georgia, all the pressure is on Argentina.
"I think that's how we'll look to play, we'll just go out and play our game with no pressure on us."
Haig agreed with Creevy that it would be a battle royale up front, something the Gloucester supporters in Kingsholm will surely cherish.
"It's going to be a battle of the forward packs there's no doubt about that, because they are both big and strong, both scrumming lineouts are very good," Haig said. "But I think it's going to be the other parts of the game that will determine who wins - who attacks the best and certainly who is able to create opportunities for themselves.

Reintroduction of death penalty greatest folly
Contemplating the reintroduction of the death penalty, the willful taking of life, thinly veiled in judicial respectability, is hideous at best. Such musings which have no place in any civilised society, are even more preposterous in a Buddhist nation that professes the sanctity of all life and abhors its wilful destruction. To present this extreme punishment as a viable deterrent to crime, in a country where political interference has destroyed any semblance of judicial independence and integrity, where there exists a de facto two-tier justice system favouring those with wealth and political power, where the instruments of law can be bought, applied and wielded at will, and where a chief justice can be arbitrarily ousted without due process, is beyond folly. The very idea, however fleetingly contemplated, is utterly deplorable and morally bankrupt.
Judicial murder can never be the answer, however heinous the crime, because we as members of civilised society should never have the power of life and death over any other human being. It is not a right we can claim through judicial ritual or by evoking eye-for-an-eye vengeance. Understanding of the sanctity of life, even the life of the most despicable and depraved, is what defines civilisation.
Buddhist teaching
A society that celebrates and revels in the achievements of its most promising, must also accept a duty of care to its most aberrant. As Sri Lankans, the detailed and profound understanding of what entails wilful and premeditated destruction of life, as articulated in Buddhist teaching - the first of the five precepts - is what defines us as a Buddhist society. Surely we cannot lay claim to any philosophical and moral superiority if we are so easily seduced by an almost primal urge for revenge. To silently condone the death penalty or openly bay for it, is to say that we as a society are willing to sully our hands with murder - judicial murder.
Justification for institutionalised murder is often presented as righteous and necessary for the protection of wider society - as the ultimate deterrent to criminal activity. But surely such justifications are spurious if they are merely based on whim, political expedience or populist belief rather than tangible evidence that proves a causal link between the death penalty and a reduction in heinous crime. The truth is, no such evidentiary link is apparent, and there is no reliable proof that such a link has ever existed. Studies on this subject bear testament to the folly that is capital punishment. Therefore if we chose to ignore this crucial fact, and forge ahead with the reintroduction of a death penalty, we must concede that our true reasoning is merely to seek retribution - a determination to kill off less desirable members or our society.
Violent retribution
As compassionate human beings who profess to cherish the virtues of metta, karuna, mudita, and upekkha, premeditated killing should be condemned not only because of the suffering of the condemned, but also, and perhaps more importantly, the suffering it inflicts upon the families of those we collectively kill.
Even if these vile offenders have had the benefit of a fair trial and are beyond our pity, surely we have no right to tell a mother, who has committed no crime, that we will take their child to the gallows and hang them because our system demands its pound of flesh. In doing this we fail her and we fail ourselves. Such barbarity is not life affirming, it only serves to cheapen human life, and strip us of our humanity.
The criminal's crimes certainly have already destroyed lives, but our violent retribution will only bring more misery and suffering to a land that has seen an unfair share of carnage.
Any decision to reintroduce the death penalty in Sri Lanka, while ultimately rubber stamped by a President and Cabinet, will in reality, be a decision made by Sri Lankans, by virtue of our action or indeed our inaction. Reintroduction of the death penalty is something each and every Sri Lankan must consider deeply.
It requires some serious soul-searching - more so for every Buddhist in the country who proclaims they live in a dharmadveepa, for where in that Buddhist philosophy or great Theravada tradition of compassion is such barbaric, premeditated judicial murder sanctioned If we truly value Buddha's teachings rather than merely pay it lip service, then we cannot in all good conscience condone this most fundamental of breaches. What's more, we must not remain silent or indifferent. Hiding behind politics and a collective anonymity will not keep the blood from our hands. Our failure to object will make hangmen of us all.

Solar Sunbathing - You can make a difference
When you go to a Jetwing hotel like Jetwing Lagoon not only do you get the best possible leisure experience along with stunning views of the lagoon on one side and the Indian Ocean the other, you also get to rest your mind and soul on the peaceful understanding that you're at one with your environment through your tacit investment in a hotel that has strong respect for and commitment to preserving it for generations to come.
Blissfully unaware
When you arrive at the hotel to the sound of pounding waves from the beach opposite the entrance with a sunset to die for and then enter through its gates to a view of the longest pool in Sri Lanka surrounded by beautiful landscaping and a range of wonderful accommodations. You become blissfully unaware of the considerable efforts that are being made behind the scenes to make your stay not only a healthy and rejuvenating experience with its new ayurveda treatment rooms, but also a rare one to be proud of in terms of your comparatively mouse-like carbon footprint.
The oasis-like swimming pool, which you can lounge in for as long as your heart desires, due to its amazing natural disinfection system using the separation of natural salt via electrolysis, whilst seeming extravagantly large at 100m long, is actually superbly efficient.
The use of local salt pans both negates the need to expensively import artificial chlorine from the Orient whilst also being kind to your eyes and saving your skin from dryness and irritation and in fact being healthy for your skin in much the same way as the Dead Sea. Five bags of salt per week are poured into the balancing tank, hidden under the garden right next to the pool, through the most unobtrusive hatch, by the highly trained team of the local staff who support the hotel and its customers in numerous ways, always taking care of their charges, that will be you, and the environment, your environment during your stay, in equal measure.
Solar panels
The pool, its bar, the Sundown bar by the beach one side and the incredible Blue Lagoon restaurant are illuminated using efficient and effective LED lighting that lasts longer and draws less energy from the 20KW array of solar power units carefully mounted on unseen areas of the beautiful terracotta roofing. This array of panels is also used to charge a large bank of batteries for lighting the hotel after sundown. Another 10KW array of solar panels are used to heat the water you bathe and wash in. Whilst the lovely cool air you feel on your shiny, maybe a tad sweaty, face as you enter your beautifully designed room is paradoxically generated by steam pressure generated by the inconspicuously sited large biomass boiler that is continuously fed luscious smelling sustainably supplied cinnamon wood from Sri Lankan farms. This boiler is less than a third of the price of a diesel generator and costs a fraction of the price of diesel to run despite needing three locally trained shift-workers to feed it 24/7. It is also used to heat water for all the site's needs after sundown when the solar panels cease to generate heat.
As you lie out next to the pool, walk its length or amble around the gardens in front of the lagoon, take a thought for the greenery around you and how its kept that way using your room's waste water recycled through a natural three stage filtration system and pumped around using solar energy.

Back in your room again, you will find delicious sustainably sourced fruits, such as passion fruit and bananas that help local farming. The hotel does not use fruits that it would have to import. Jetwing Lagoon was restored to keep the Geoffrey Bawa architecture built around nature and added bigger windows to use mostly natural lighting and inside the rooms plastic has been removed all together and only recycled bottles re-filled with pure water whilst toiletries are kept in rustic material cloth bags. As you leave your room again and remove your key from its holder, a timer is triggered to turn off all but the most essential services to the room.
In the restaurant you will see stunning art work on large canvases, which is made from recycled beach rubbish beaten red, blue, orange and gold into amazing abstracts. We don't expect that you will leave much of your food as it is so delicious but if you find your eyes bigger than your mouth - you need not worry as the leftover food is composted into fertiliser to grow vegetables and bananas.
High standards
The hotel hires only staff who are very highly trained to make your stay as special as possible and more than 60 percent of them live within 10km away from the hotel, so reducing the wider impact of the hotel if staff were taken from further afield. When it comes to transport, the drivers are provided with quarters when going home would be pointless, so reducing the amount of fuel wasted when commuting and ensuring a more efficient service to guests.
They also hire a full time environmentalist responsible for maintaining the high standards already achieved whilst also constantly looking to develop new ideas. In addition to this the management team looks constantly on how to think internationally, drawing on local green ideas to lower their footprint. If ever the government shuts down, Jetwing can carry on with its self sufficient systems that if other hotels adopt the same standards, it will make Negombo the green capital of Sri Lanka. Now that is worth aiming for and you the traveller can refuse to stay at places that do not set this as their primary initiative. In the end each one of us can make a difference and leave a travel footprint for future generations to follow.

Sri Lankas UN journey
Fifty years on, it is easy to forget that John Lionel Kotelawela was Prime Minister when Sri Lanka (then, Ceylon) negotiated its way into UN membership. He had many endearing qualities but is rarely cited as an expert in foreign policy. Professor S.A. Pakeman has pointed out, however, that Kotelawela was far more interested in world politics than his two predecessors, the Senanayakes. (Ceylon, London, 1964). This interest, combined with irritation over the game of mutual veto that the superpowers were playing in New York, made him determined to break down the barriers that held the country back from UN membership. To achieve this goal, he conscripted Lake House publisher Esmond Wickremesinghe as a special envoy with the single assignment of securing UN membership for Ceylon.
Wickremesinghe had an innate feel for international relations, which was supplemented by almost encyclopaedic knowledge. He was, moreover, charming, polished and relentlessly persuasive. Supported by R.S.S. Gunewardene, Sri Lanka's ambassador to the US, he crafted a package deal that could enable a number of countries which had previously been denied the welcome mat to join the UN together. He then did what was considered almost impossible: he negotiated full support for the package from both veto-wielding superpowers. He was back in Colombo when Sri Lanka was formally admitted to the UN, and was the first to inform Kotelawela. An elated Prime Minister promptly offered Wickremesinghe a knighthood which the latter equally promptly declined. The knighthood went to Gunewardene, who became Sir Senerat.
Kotelawela was disappointed that his own ministry was not first off the mark to inform him of the country's admission to the UN. They must be asleep, he added for good measure. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike would also refer, subsequently, to sleeping habits in Colombo when he addressed the UN, an interesting coincidence.

After more than fifty years in Sri Lanka, the UN continues to make a difference in the lives of the Sri Lankan people who are strongly engaged with the UN in more ways than one. A broad and wide ranging partnership  with the Government, civil society, the broad NGO community, bilateral donors, and international financial institutions  has been developed to address a multitude of challenges, both in long term development, and during times of emergency.
Sri Lanka and the UN system maintain a mutually beneficial and interactive relationship.
On the one hand, as a very active member state of the UN, Sri Lanka helps to formulate and implement the UNs policies throughout the world. On the other hand, the UN has consistently contributed to the economic, social and cultural progress of Sri Lanka and its people.
Global peace and security
Sri Lanka attended all General Assembly sessions; ran the 1976 GA session; proposed the 1978 Disarmament Session. The assembly, the UNs main forum for debate, is the only UN body which includes representatives from all member countries. Sri Lanka has always been an active and a dynamic participant at all General Assembly sessions of the UN, over the past six decades.
Sri Lanka was a non-permanent member between 1960-65 of the UN Security Council tasked with ensuring global peace and security.
It has five permanent member nations and Sri Lanka has always maintained a cordial relationship with member nations of the Security Council.
Secretary General of the UN
One of the most important moments of Sri Lankas engagement with the UN was Dr. Jayantha Dhanapalas candidacy for the Secretary-General position alongside Ban ki Moon. Although Ban Ki-moon went on to become the Secretary General of the UN, it was a proud moment for Sri Lanka which maintained a strong engagement with the UN since 1955.
On the other hand, Sri Lanka is the 16th largest troop contributing country to the UN. One thousand Sri Lankan UN troops have served in Haiti, Cote dIvoire, Sudan, Western Sahara, Mozambique, Timor-Leste, Liberia. United Nations peacekeeping is a unique and dynamic instrument to help countries torn by conflict to create the conditions for lasting peace.
Sri Lankas new government, which came to power in January, this year, has strengthened the international communitys faith in the armed forces of the country and that, in return, has consolidated Sri Lankas position in this particular area.
Sri Lanka is a signatory to most of the important UN Conventions. Among them are:
*International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (in force March 20, 1982)
*International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (in force September 11, 1980)
*Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (in force January 03, 1998)
*International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (in force 11 September 1980)
*Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (in force November 04, 1981)
*Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (in force January 15, 2003)
*Convention Against Torture, and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (in force February 02, 1994)
*Convention on the Rights of the Child (in force August 11, 1991)
*Optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (in force February 12, 2002)
*Optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (October 22, 2006)
*International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (in force July 1, 2003)
*Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Signatory: 30-Mar-07)

Taste of Sri Lanka a big success
The aroma, colours, local culture and the sea of Sri Lankan cuisine enthusiasts brought together a vivid narrative of a true Sri Lankan experience as the Boardwalk Garden at Waters Edge was completely transformed into a Sri Lankan village. With typical native quirks, activities and a feast like none other was held from September 10 to the 13.
A vast number of guests were pleased with the delicious plethora of classical Sri Lankan dishes. Similar to the vast geographical variances of the country, the cooking techniques, flavours and certain ingredients greatly differ from region to region. For the purpose of introducing and presenting such variances in the spice-rich cuisine of Sri Lanka, Waters Edge initiated 'Tastes of Sri Lanka- featuring King of Hoppers Chef Ravi & Rotti Maestro Chef Farris".
The 'All You Can Eat Buffet' provided the perfect opportunity to experience a united island with authentic Sri Lankan cuisine featuring a galore of signature mains ranging from Lamprais, Red/Yellow Rice, a spicy range of Kottu/ Rotti and of course a spectacular selection of Hoppers.
Over 60 Sri Lankan dishes originating from distinctive regions of the island prepared to different recipes, were enjoyed by all the guests. The specialty in Sri Lankan food is that the same food is differently made in different regions; Negombo Pork Stew with Liver, Batticaloa Mutton Curry, Jaffna Kool Curry are a few dishes out of the many which were made able over the weekend at the Boardwalk.
Boardwalk was completely transformed into a 'village' setup with pol athu huts and guests were welcomed and served by the staff dressed in redda & hatta for the ladies and sarongs for the gents. With a traditional arrack cocktail at hand the guests were entertained with an exciting cultural show with traditional yaka dances and fire entertainers on all four days. As a nightcap to end the perfect evening Chef Ravi brewed Yaara or Ginger tea for all diners at each of their tables; making it a show of its own with his bright smile and intriguing humour.
