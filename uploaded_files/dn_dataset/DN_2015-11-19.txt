Mom, Me and My Milo campaign launched
Milo, the nourishing energy beverage brand, has been synonymous with school sports in Sri Lanka for over three decades.
In a mission to encourage children to embrace physical activity, Milo now takes another big leap by offering children the chance to win as many as 1000 mountain bikes through the Mom, Me and My Milo campaign.
Milo Brand Ambassador and National Cricket Captain Angelo Mathews was a recipient of the Milo Colours Award for two consecutive years.
These initiatives have played a significant role in instilling positive values such as discipline, leadership skills, nurturing a winning attitude and team spirit, helping children develop well-rounded personalities and moulding them into becoming leaders and exemplary citizens of tomorrow.
The launch of the Mom, Me and My Milo campaign not only helps bring mothers together with their children, but inspires children to stay physically active and healthy throughout the day, said Norman Kannangara, Asst. Vice President  Beverages of Nestl Lanka PLC.
The Mom, Me and My Milo campaign provides a unique opportunity to mothers who play a key role in providing the nutrition requirements and driving the physical development of their children to get involved by taking selfies of themselves and their young ones with a Milo ready-to-drink pack.
Children between the ages of 8  16 years who meet the given criteria are eligible to participate in the contest up until November 25 and win their very own mountain bicycle via raffle draws conducted every week.
The first two weekly draws witnessed an impressive consumer response from which 500 lucky winners were selected.

## Title: Smart City or Megalopolis!

Smart City or Megalopolis!
When Minister Champika Ranawaka mentioned that he wants to build Smart Cities in Sri Lanka, just as he assumed duties in his new ministry, the Ministry of Megalopolis and Western Province Development at Sethsiripaya couple of weeks after taking oath as a Minister, I knew,being present there, no one understood the real meaning what a Smart City or a Sabuddhimath Nagara in Sinhalese really meant.
This went into the print and electronic media islandwide the following day.
On September 4,2015 when the new Cabinet of the United National Front was sworn in, Champika Ranavaka got the portfolio as the Minister of Megapolis and Western Province Development'. Many people called and asked me Hey, Champika is asked to handle a new Police, what is it I jokingly said Yes, as he is a Nationalist, He is being asked to Police the unpatriotic Sinhalese in a Mega manner'.
According to Wikipedia, British Dictionary, Random House Dictionary and The Thesaurus all state that the word Megapolis is wrong and should be Megalopolis'. This is a conjoined Greek word meaning super large or an exaggerated massiveness Megalo + another Greek word for city, Polis.
Simply put, Megalopolis is a region made up of several large cities and their surrounding areas in sufficient proximity and joined, to be considered a single urban complex is what a Megalopolis really is.
This was was written by Sir Patrik Geddes, born in 1854 in Scotland, in his book Cities in Evolution'.
He was supposed to be the first ever conceptualizer on Urban Planning and Sociology and was also involved in the forming of one of the world's largest Universities, the University of Mumbai.
Keeping aside the Megalopolis concept, let us see what a Smart City is. A smart city uses digital technologies or information and communication technologies (ICT) to enhance quality and performance of urban services, to reduce costs and resource consumption, and to engage more effectively and actively with its citizens'.
This is the basic definition given about a Smart City. It is solely based on the Internet or Digital Technology or Information Communication Technology (ICT) as shown above.
The basic sections included are, Government Services, Transport and Traffic Management, Energy, Health Care, Water and Waste Management. According to Wikipedia other names for a Smart City are Cyberville, Digital City', Electronic Communities, Flexicity, Information City, Intelligent City, Knowledge-based City, Mesh City, Telecity, Teletopia, Ubiquitous City, Wired City'& as Champikasaid in Singhala, SabuddhimathNagara (Super Intelligent Cities).
A Smart City is defined in many ways.Deakin says the following criteria should be met. 1. The application of a wide range of electronic and digital technologies to communities and cities. 2. The use of ICT to transform life and working environments within the region. 3. The embedding of such ICTs in government systems. 4. The territorialisation of practices that brings ICTs and people together to enhance the innovation and knowledge that they offer.
Some say A smart city is one that has digital technology embedded across all city functions. In any case it is a city with all digital signals, the 0s and the 1sscrambled, going across the city.
Though these are supposed to be Intelligent Cities, they are in fact artificial Intelligence all geared up. But, I say it is somewhat similar to the human body.
The Digital Communication network is like the Nerves. The Embedded Chips or the Intelligence is the Brain. Sensors situated all over the city resembles the Sensory Organs of ours, while the Software to drive the artificial Intelligence is our Knowledge.
In a Smart City,Information Technology should be used to make more efficient use of the Physical Infrastructure such as Network of Roads, Buildings etc for the betterment of humans socially & culturally through Artificial Intelligence.
Through e-governance to engage the citizens in their participation in a practical & an efficient manner thus making local governance more productive.
The 1st ever Smart City - The Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, UK.
The 1st ever Smart City is supposed to be the Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, UK, established in 1938 to decode Nazi messages. It was used by UK's Government Code& Cypher School to decipher Hitler's military messages & codes. It is said that if not for the work done at Bletchley Park, the war would have gone on for 2 more years.
In the Smart City context, the above example of Bletchley Park is called 1.'Orchestration Intelligence where cities base institutions & communities for problem solving. Next we have the 2.'Empowerment Intelligence where cities offer open platforms, facilities to experiment and infrastructure included in Smart Cities to innovate and experiment.
These can be seen in places such as Kista Science City in Stockholm and the Cyberport Zone in Hong Kong as well as in Melbourne. City infrastructure is made smart through real time data collection and is known as 'Instrumentation Intelligence'.
Instrumentation Intelligence in Amsterdam is done through having a common IP structure for researchers to develop applications and wireless meters and devices transmitting data. Some homes have been provided with Smart Energy meters. Energy saving lamps, car recharging devices and solar power garbage compactors add to the list.
Smart Cities are needed for Governance'. Enriching the quality of life through e-governance allowing administration services to the citizens and participating directly in governance.
'Urban Infrastructure such as transport, all utilities, protection of the environment and safety through Smart Cities are also anticipated. Innovation and the economy too are enhanced through new innovations in all forms, education, health and the creation of knowledge intensive companies.
A Smart City should be equipped with new Internet technologies such as Cloud Based Services, Smart Phones, Smart Utility Meters, Radio Frequency Identification methods known as RFID and IoT or the Internet of Things.
The phrase Internet of Things was coined by British entrepreneur Kevin Ashton in 1999.Typically, IoT is expected to offer advanced connectivity of devices, systems, and services that goes beyond machine-to-machine communications (M2M)and covers a variety of protocols, domains, and applications.
RFIDs have a great job to do in a Smart City. From embedding a transponder in a Child's uniform or a school bag, to managing farm animals, to having these on vehicles is a must. I will be doing an article on the great value of RFIDs later on.
In the city of Santander in Spain, more than 20,000 sensors connecting buildings, transport networks, utilities and infrastructure facilities make life easy for the citizens. These sensors monitor traffic, pollution and parking.
E-cards or Smart Cards are another innovative method to make life easy in a Smart City. It has an ID number where the holder can communicate with the governance to get data and to personally interact with different government establishments using one ID number dedicated to him. This is implemented in Southampton, UK. We can use the NIC with a Smart Chip embedded.
This should have been done before the Passports.
Research and Development inside Smart Cities would encourage innovators to design, conceptualize and provide the starting point for manufacturing of items. IT tools can be used for making platforms for e-governance and citizen participation.
In 2003-10-17, 12 years ago, I penned an article Singapore Syndrome (Daily News) regarding E-governance and a Smart City with regards to the Internet of Things which was Abracadabra for the Lankans.
I suggested embedding a Smart Chip in the NIC, to be used especially for anti crime work and to keep a track of citizens when going from one Jurisdiction to another. If you are not guilty of any crime or offence why worry!Privacy is different to the guilty conscience.
Amsterdam initiated the modern day Smart City project in 2009. Flexible street lighting which allows municipalities to control the brightness of street lights, and smart traffic management where traffic is monitored in real time by the City and information about current travel time on certain roads is broadcast to allow motorists to determine the best routes to take.
Various projects are done by the citizens, departments and companies collaborating together on a single platform.
In Barcelona, where an emergency is reported, the approximate route of the emergency vehicle is entered into the traffic light system, setting all the lights to green as the vehicle approaches through a mix of GPS and traffic management software, allowing emergency services to reach the incident without delay.
Now lets look at our neighbour India's Smart City initiative. The Delhi Master Plan for 2021 by the Delhi Development Authority which was initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The building construction is undertaken by the National Building Construction Corporation of India and hopes to complete it in 3 years time. A 100 story building is in the offing. Spain has signed an agreement with India for the start of a Smart City. USA plans to start 3 with Germany 1 more in India.
Japan who was a late starter on Smart Cities has 4 towns in the making. City of Yokohama, Toyota City, Keihanna(combining Kyoto, Osaka and Nara) Science City in Kyoto and the City of Kita Kyushu.
City of Yokohama is demonstrating how the level of reduction in peak power demand changes with the provision of information and the offering of incentives.
They targeted 3,500 households which is the largest for in Japan. As part of the Yokohama Smart City Project (YSCP), a V2H (vehicle to home) system was developed such that storage batteries in electric vehicles (EV) were charged with electric power from home Photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems and conversely the storage batteries supplied electric power to homes. The V2H experiment would be a good starter for Sri Lankan Homes.
Keihanna Science City is experimenting with an Eco City project. Experiments were done on 14 houses in energy saving through the use of Photovoltaic cells and Storage batteries coupled with a Home Energy Management System or HEMS.
The objectives of the experiment were to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions and to respond to peak demand reduction and electric power supply.
Toyota City, the home of the Toyota Motors, have started a successful Low Carbon Society system reducing Carbon Footprint.
Smart Mobility and Energy Life project is thriving to produce a low carbon atmosphere. Toyota Smart City covers about 929 SqKms with a population of about 422,830 as at 2012.
They are also targeting a Low Carbon Transport System using Plug In Hybrids (PHV)& Electric Vehicles (EV). Based on the Innovation Cities Index, here are the top 10 smart cities in the world to date.
1-Vienna
Vienna was the only city that ranked in the top 10 in every category in the'Innovation Cities Index'. It is well ahead of the pack in establishing brave smart-city targets and tracking their progress, in particular with programs like the Smart Energy Vision 2050, Roadmap 2020, and Action Plan 2012-2015'.
2-Toronto
The highest rated smart city in North America, Toronto scores quite well across the board.
The big names in Technology recognize this too - IBM recently opened a Business Analytics Solutions Center in the city and Toronto is also an active member of C40 megacities.
3-Paris
Another European city representing connectivity to counterparts. Paris was highly rated in several categories including innovation, green cities in Europe, and digital governance.
Paris was already on the world map for its highly successful bike sharing program, Velib, and it is following up this success with a similar scheme for Electric Vehicles (EV).
4-New York
New York scored higher than most other cities in the ranking in all of the categories.
New York partnered with IBM in 2009 to launch the IBM Business Analytics Solution Center to address the growing demand for the complex capabilities needed to build smarter cities and help clients optimize all manner of business processes and business decisions.
5-Stockholm
Home to the HQ of Ericsson, pioneers of the Networked Society, Stockholm scores highly on the Innovation Cities Index for obvious reasons; it has a long track record of focused initiatives to drive the progress of ICT infrastructure. Stockholm was also the first city in the world to introduce 4G/LTE mobile services.
6-London
The UK capital also scored relatively high across the board. London has been well-recognized for some of its sustainability innovations i.e. congestion tax and its robust transport system.
The city is home to Smart Cities research center housed at Imperial College, which focuses on initiatives in hope of making the city more efficient and innovative.
7-Tokyo
Tokyo is the first Asian city on this list, scoring well in both the innovation and digital city categories. In 2011, the city announced plans to create a smart town in the suburbs. In partnership with Panasonic, Accenture, and Tokyo Gas, the eco suburb will contain homes that integrate solar panels, storage batteries, and energy efficient appliances all connected to a smart grid.
8-Berlin
Berlin also performs well across the board, with good scores in innovation and green-ness.
One of the most interesting initiatives Berlin has focused on a collaboration with BMW.
Together, they are testing out vehicle-to-grid (V2G)technologies in the hopes of creating a virtual power plant from electric vehicles.
9-Hong Kong
Hong Kong scored quite well in key areas, Hong Kong is experimenting withRadio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology in its airport, as well as throughout the agriculture supply chain.
The city has also been a leader in the adoption of smart cards, which are already used by millions of residents for services like public transit, library access, building access, shopping, and car parks.
10-Barcelona
Barcelona was recently ranked the number two smart city in Spain in the IDC report. The city is a pioneer in smart city and low-carbon solutions.
It was among the first in the world to introduce a solar thermal ordinance about a decade ago.
This list is sure to evolve; expect smart cities to become a sizable market, with projections of nearly $40 billion spent on smart-city technologies by 2016.
It is also assumed that 70% of the world's population will live in cities by 2020. The idea of so many people living in such close proximity is a prospect much easier to envision if most cities are moving towards being truly connected.
So, when will Sri Lanka enter this list Through my research on Smart Cities, one more criteria was that a Smart City should have Smart People'. Would the never ending chatter of a falsified pride of that 2,500 year old history by the majority of the masses bring disaster to the dreams of the lovers of living in futuristic townships and mega development for a cool livingTo live peacefully in serenity without the death knell of the Claxons and the Beat of the Vikings and the Exhaust Pipes and the Mobile Discos of the Bajajs and the cacophony of Mahajana Sampatha and the yelling of Yakada Katas belonging to almighties be it Yellow, Green or Black.
My grandmother told me that speech is Silver and silence is Gold and also that the empty vessels make the most sound. It took me half a century to realize it happening right here in my motherland.
But, if Smart Cities are a dream to be implemented in Sri Lanka, forget fulfilling it, as long as the Bajajs, the Vikings and the Defenders along with the Ghantaras and the Thrishoolas exist. Good luck to you my good friend the Minister of Megalopolis and Western Province Development! Good luck to all of us! Let's change! Let's try!Lets have at least one Smart Zero Crime Grama NiladhariVasama here in Sri Lanka to start off with, where citizens could really live in peace and serenity and get their day to day work done sans any politicization, bureaucracy or red tape.

All Black legend Jonah Lomu dead at 40
Wellington, Wednesday: Rugby great Jonah Lomu, a pioneering global superstar whose speed and power terrorised opponents, died unexpectedly on Wednesday aged 40 after a long battle with kidney disease, prompting an outpouring of tributes for "a legend of the game".
Lomu had for decades struggled with the kidney illness that cut short his playing career, but close acquaintances said his sudden death still came as a shock. He passed away at his Auckland home, family spokesman John Mayhew said, after returning from a trip to Britain.
"It was totally unexpected, Jonah and his family arrived back from the UK last night and he suddenly died this morning," Mayhew told TV3.
Mayhew, a former medic with the All Blacks, revealed Lomu's family were "going through a terrible time", before he broke down in tears. Lomu played 63 Tests and scored 37 tries for New Zealand, rising to stardom at the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa. At his peak, the 1.96 metre (six foot five inch) Lomu weighed 120 kilograms (265 pounds) and could cover 100 metres in 10.8 seconds.
He combined the speed of a backline player with the power of a forward, creating a new template for wingers and attracting a global audience for the newly professional sport of rugby union.
Fellow legends paid tribute on social media to a player they acknowledged had a unique status.
"I am so, so devastated to hear of the passing away of @JONAHTALILOMU," England's Jonny Wilkinson tweeted. "The greatest superstar and just a fabulous human being. Deeply saddened."
France's Thierry Dusautoir said "you inspired a generation of rugby players around the world", while Welshman Jonathan Davies hailed "a true legend and a gentleman".

Because it's flexible, immediate, and infuses tone beautifully...
'Emoji embody a core aspect of a digital world that is visually driven, emotionally expressive, and obsessively immediate'
It may not be a word by the strictest definition - but the emoji commonly known as "face with tears of joy" has been named the "Word" of the Year for 2015 by Oxford Dictionaries.
A breakthrough year for the pictograms first spread by texting teens has been marked by the Oxford Dictionaries' recognition for a word or expression that "captures the ethos, mood, or preoccupations of that particular year."
The body cited Hillary Clinton soliciting feedback in emoji and on-going debates about the skin tone of smiley faces, as evidence that "emoji have come to embody a core aspect of living in a digital world that is visually driven, emotionally expressive, and obsessively immediate."
Casper Grathwohl, President of Oxford Dictionaries, said: "You can see how traditional alphabet scripts have been struggling to meet the rapid-fire, visually focused demands of 21st Century communication. It's not surprising that a pictographic script like emoji has stepped in to fill those gaps-it's flexible, immediate, and infuses tone beautifully.
"As a result emoji are becoming an increasingly rich form of communication, one that transcends linguistic borders. When Andy Murray tweeted out his wedding itinerary entirely in emoji, for example, he shared a subtle mix of his feelings about the day directly with fans around the world. It was highly effective in expressing his emotions."
Research by mobile technology business SwiftKey found that "Face with Tears of Joy" was the most heavily used emoji globally in 2015.
Their statistics showed that the character comprised 20% of all emoji used in the UK in 2015.
Oxford Dictionaries defines a "word" variously as a "single distinct meaningful element of speech or writing" or "conceptual unit of language", allowing emoji to take their place among more conventional communicative forms.
Oxford Dictionaries lexicographers also identified a sharp increase in the use of the word emoji itself in 2015. Emoji is a loanword from Japanese defined as "a small digital image or icon used to express an idea or emotion in electronic communication.

Charlie Sheen reveals he is HIV-positive
US: US actor Charlie Sheen, as well known for his on-screen work as his off-screen debauchery with drugs, booze and prostitutes, revealed Tuesday he is HIV-positive -- and paid millions of dollars in hush money.
I am here to admit that I am in fact HIV-positive, the 50-year-old Sheen said on the NBC morning talk show Today.
Its a hard three letters to absorb, you know, he said. Its a turning point in ones life.
Sheen, whose stint as a middle-aged womanizing bachelor on the sitcom Two and a Half Men made him Americas highest paid TV actor, said he has known of his condition for about four years but does not know how he contracted the virus.
He said he has paid upwards of $10 million to people who knew about his infection to keep them quiet and that he is coming clean to escape those shakedowns.
What people forget is that its money taken from my children, he said about the extortion. Sheen has been married three times and has five children.
Asked if he is still paying such money, he said Not after today, I am not. I think I released myself from this prison today.
Most recently known for the TV series Anger Management, Sheen had prominent film roles in the 1980s, particularly in Vietnam war movie Platoon and Wall Street with Michael Douglas.
Sheen said that when he first started feeling sick, with terrible migraines and sweating so much at night it drenched his bed, it was so bad he thought he had a brain tumor and was close to death.
After undergoing tests -- spinal taps, all that crap -- doctors gave him the diagnosis that he had the virus that causes AIDS.
Over the years, Sheen has acknowledged widespread drug and alcohol use as well as a penchant for hiring prostitutes.
Sheen, son of the actor Martin Sheen, said that since getting his diagnosis he has told all of his sexual partners before having intercourse.
He also said he was certain that he had not passed on the virus to any of his partners.
Sheens doctor Robert Huizenga -- appearing in the same NBC interview -- said Sheen is taking anti-viral medication, has responded well and now has an undetectable level of the virus in his body.
My biggest concern with Charlie as a patient is substance abuse and depression from the disease more than what the HIV virus can do in terms of shortening his life, because it is not going to, Huizenga said.
He insisted Sheen does not have full-blown AIDS.
On Twitter, #CharlieSheen was trending, with many people expressing shock or even disgust that he had paid $10 million to conceal his secret.
Words of sympathy came from actress Heather Locklear, who appeared with Sheen in the sitcom Spin City, which ran from 1996-2002. My heart hurts. Prayers for Charlie and his family, Locklear wrote on Instagram, where she posted a picture of her and Sheen.
In 2011, Sheen was fired from Two and a Half Men after criticizing its producer in a stream of media outbursts, losing the estimated $2 million an episode he was making at the time.
The CBS show was subsequently canceled for the rest of that season. The sitcom later returned -- with Sheens character killed off.
Sheen went on a months-long public meltdown in the wake of his dismissal, during which he gave a series of rambling television interviews in which he seemed to be under the effect of drugs or alcohol, saying bizarre things like that he had tiger blood and Adonis DNA.
In several interviews, he seemed very cocky and referred to himself often someone who was winning.
By his own timeline given Tuesday, 2011 would be about the time Sheen learned of his HIV-positive diagnosis. In the interview with Today, he was not asked about any link between the diagnosis and his breakdown.
But in an open letter released after the interview, Sheen said that after he had started treatment and felt he was kicking this diseases ass, out of anger, shame and disbelief he fell into a downward spiral.
He called it a temporary yet abysmal descent into profound substance abuse and fathomless drinking. It was a suicide run.
Sheen admitted Tuesday he is not taking recreational drugs any more but does drink a little bit. He returned to television in 2012 with Anger Management, but its run on the FX network ended last year.
Sheen said that now that he has gone public and is free of blackmailers, I accept this condition not as a curse or scourge, but rather as an opportunity and a challenge. An opportunity to help others. A challenge to better myself.

Rainy days
Dear Children,
Have you ever heard the saying The best thing one can do when it's raining is to let it rain And have you ever wondered what it means Well, when it's raining nobody can stop it, so the best thing is to let it to rain! Rainy days are like bad times. Do you know why As the American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson says bad times have a scientific value. These are occasions a good learner would not miss. We all experience bad days at least once in a while. Such days help us learn how to face hardships and emerge victoriously. Bitter days teach us how to be patient.
And back to our topic, rainy days teach us how to finish our work on time without delaying. I am sure your mother might have asked you to put your clothes out to dry before it rains. All want to be at home before the rains.
There are many poems and songs written on the rain. Have you ever heard the poem How beautiful is the rain Let me give you the first four lines of it. How beautiful is the rain After the dust and heat, In the broad and fiery street, In the narrow lane, How beautiful is the rain!...
However as you know the rain is not so beautiful always. It can be quite the opposite. As you know rains can play havoc across the country. These days many areas of the country have been affected by floods. Many people live in temporary shelter. So the rains can be a blessing as well as a curse. Remember nothing is good in excess.
Why don't you pen down your thoughts about this rainy weather or draw a sketch and send us.
Bye for now,
Aunty Sanju
Dogs
The dog is a domestic animal. This four-footed pet has a tail, sharp claws and sharp teeth. It eats rice, bread, meat, fish, milk etc. It has thick hair, but some species possess thin hair. It may be of different colours: white, brown, black, or a mixture of these colours. Dogs are of different species and different sizes and looks.
The dog is a faithful animal. It can easily accept good training.
At night, it guards its master's house. It accompanies its master to the jungle to take active part in hunting, by tracking down the game. It has a very strong sense of smell. It is specially trained by the police or military departments for smelling the traces of crimes and finding out the culprit, either indoors or outdoors.
The dog is generally found to be treated in the human society as a member of the family, as they are useful to man in many ways.
Big size dogs, such as Alsatians, Golden Retrievers, etc, sometimes resemble wolves, tigers or panthers. With training, they are ferocious.
The small size dogs are tamed mainly for the pleasure of the master, because they are not so strong as to fight or defend themselves from stronger animals, thieves or rogues. But some of them look pretty and are loved as darlings'.

Deepavali
Deepavali or Deepali means a collection of lighted lamps with which the houses and temples are decorated on the occasion of the festival Deepanvita. The festival falls every year on the day of the new-moon in the month of October, when Goddess Kali is worshipped and the dwelling houses and temples and also public places belonging to the Hindus are beautifully illumined with hundreds of rows of lighted lamps.
The Deepavali illumination signifies the rays of hope and prospect for a higher life lit in millions of hearts of the Hindus. Deepavali symbolizes the aspiration noticed in the Brihadaranyaka Upanisadic hymn:
Tamaso ma Jyotirgamaya
(Lead me from darkness to light). Mrityor ma Amtitamagamaya
(Lead me from death to immortality).
Thus the festival of Deepavali is not merely a festival of merriment, but it is a pointer to higher life.
The origin of Deepavali is mixed with various myths and legends, such as the killing of the demon called Narakasura by Sri Krishna, or the destruction of Ravana by Sri Ramachandra. The inner meaning of Deepavali is the overcoming of the evil by the good, the advancement of evolution of mankind to the supreme goal.
On the occasion, the Hindus exchange good wishes and greetings, and distribute sweetmeats, various presents and new clothes amongst their friends and relatives as a gesture of love and affection.

ComBank donates computer lab to Technical College
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has donated a fully-equipped and furnished computer lab to the Maradana College of Technology, the oldest technical college in Sri Lanka.
One of the largest IT Labs donated by the Bank under its flagship Corporate Social Responsibility Initiative to raise national computer literacy levels, the lab at the Technical College comprises of 20 new computers, 20 tables, 20 chairs, a multimedia projector and a photocopy machine.
The bank also renovated the classroom chosen for the IT lab.
The new lab will support the recently established Accounting Process Unit of the Department of Commerce of the College of Technology.
The Department offers courses for the National Certificate for Accounting Technicians (NCAT) and the National Diploma in Accountancy (NDA), as well as for the National Certificate in Secretarial Practice and the National Certificate in Shorthand, Typewriting and Computing. After evaluating the courses offered at the Department, the Bank felt it is a vital need for these students to have an IT laboratory since it would allow them to become IT-savvy accounting professionals, Mr Nandika Buddhipala, Chief Financial Officer of Commercial Bank said.
Commercial Banks IT Education initiative is intended to enable younger generations and the country to face the future with confidence with world-class knowledge. This programme shares synergy with the Banks enduring vision of being the most technologically-advanced, innovative and customer friendly financial services organisation in Sri Lanka. The IT Labs donated by the Bank to date have benefitted an estimated 170,000 students.
All computer laboratories donated by Commercial Banks CSR Trust are equipped with brand new computers with licensed software.
The schools are also provided accessories such as computer tables, printers and chairs, and the Bank provides assistance to maintain and upgrade these computer labs when necessary to ensure that the facilities benefit many batches of students.
Other initiatives of the Banks CSR Trust in the sphere of education include presenting scholarships and laptops to undergraduates annually, providing English education to rural school children, and a project in partnership with Cisco Networking Academy to offer a comprehensive IT Essentials course for teachers and students free of charge, via the Banks online Education programme. Earlier this year, the Bank launched a new educational website called Sipnena to support online education in schools and commenced a pilot project to use online test papers to sharpen the mathematics skills of students preparing for their GCE Ordinary Level examinations.

Concessions to consumers on 10 essential items
Ten essential commodities will be given to the people at concessionary prices by the 2016 budget, which is the second budget of
the government formed under the leadership of Maithripala Sirisena, Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said.
Addressing the media at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday he said that the main objective is protecting the living standards of needy people. The people will be offered a 'relief package' to safeguard their living standards and consuming patterns.
The budget deficit was over Rs. 1450 billion last year. It is expected to be reduced to 3.2 percent of the GDP by 2020. It is 6.8 in 2015. In 2016, it is expected to be brought down to 6.1 percent.
According to Dr. Amunugama, there are 20 or 30 different taxes that exist now and these taxes will be simplified by the 2016 budget. Those who stand bellow the tax line will not be subjected to direct taxes except indirect taxes. This means those who do not pay taxes at present will not pay tax in the future.
Dr. Amunugama pointed out that Sri Lanka has established a better International relationship and smooth coordination which will be benefit the country's exporters. Earlier there was a contradiction in the Sri Lankan foreign policy where we opposed the US politically while having exported 70 percent of our products to the US. Our paddy production is more than the requirement and now we have post harvest issues which are something connected to prosperity.

Dating Tiger Woods was 'not my smartest move'
In an in-depth interview with the New York Times, Olympic champion Lindsey Vonn says she rushed into her multi-year romance with the once-scandalised golf great, calling their relationship a "learning experience" while managing to praise their time together.
Vonn and Woods dated for more than two years, from March 2013 until May 2015, when they announced a "mutual" breakup that was haunted by rumours of Woods lapsing back into his old cheating ways.
"Thomas was really my first boyfriend, so I didn't have a lot of dating experience," she said of ex-husband Thomas Vonn, whom she married in 2007 at the age of 22 and officially divorced in January 2013. "So jumping into a relationship right away after getting a divorce was probably not the smartest move on my part.
"I don't regret anything. I loved Tiger, and I had an amazing three years with him. But it was a learning experience as well. With every relationship, you learn what you need and what you want in a partner."
So what about that next partner Vonn, 31, confirms she's single and putting post-Tiger courtship on hold for the time being.
"I don't have a boyfriend, and you need one of those to start a family," she told the Times. "I really want a family; I come from a big family. But I'm not going to force anything. I have a limited window to accomplish my ski-racing dreams, so I don't want to give that up for really anything."
The two-time Olympic medallist's bid for skiing history resumes on the World Cup circuit Nov. 28 in Aspen, after several years ruined by devastating knee and ankle injuries. Vonn is considered the favourite to capture the overall title, with her two chief rivals - Anna Fenninger and Tina Maze - missing this winter season, and has targeted the 2018 Games in South Korea to go for gold once again.

Designs to remember: In memory of Ena de Silva
Ena De Silva whose father was the first Ceylonese Head of the Police Force and whose husbnad was also an IGP passed away recently at the age of 93. I met her first around twenty three years back . She already knew one of my grandfathers. She was offcourse already well known for her batiks.
My associaton began with an offer to make availible her ceations primarily in wood,brass, cushions etc to buyers in Colombo. It was a shortlived enterprise since I had move the outlet out. It also led to supporting the setting up of the second kitchen as it was termed in Aluvihare offering tasty resaonably priced meals by the main road.
The pictures featured today are from those she created in wood,brass,silver,metal and fabric. There are also glimpses of the manner in which the inside of her house was furnished and decorated. The menu in what was known as Alu 1 where the other kitchen was located by the batik works was quite simply extraordinary. One hears of 15 - 16 course Italian meals. Alu 1 had a similar number of items except it was wholly Sri Lankan. One broadly speaking staggered out in a state of shock having consumed an extraordianry fare with what was created in the kitchen. It was an experience. Even in her house there was no such thing as a simple meal.
What she created was pretty much one of a kind. She was the artist and principle designer whose designs were executed by an able band of men,women, boys and girls whose workmanship is seen in the pictures. I hope the pictures featured in appreciation of her extraordinary creativity and talent would give readers a full measure of an unforgettable icon and a tribute to Sri Lankan design.

Emerge Lanka emerges as Runner-up
Emerge Lanka Foundation, a Sri Lankan organization that empowers abused girls, was selected as Runner-up at Project Inspire 2015 held in Singapore on November 13. Project Inspire is a worldwide social impact competition run by the Singapore Committee for UN Women and MasterCard.
Emerge Lanka Foundation was the only Sri Lankan organization that was selected as a finalist out of more than 430 applications. As Runner-up, Emerge Lanka won an award from Hilton Worldwide to support expansion of its programmes.
"Over the past year, we've been so inspired to see our girls realizing their dreams, including building a home, studying for A/Ls or nursing, and receiving leadership awards," states Mumtaz Faleel, Emerge Lanka's Country Manager in a press release. "We are excited that this grant gives us the opportunity to reach more inspiring and courageous girls and strengthen our community of change makers and leaders."
Emerge Lanka Foundation is a charitable organization that supports Sri Lankan girls, ages 10-18, who have been removed from their homes due to past abuse or the threat of abuse and are courageously testifying in court.
These girls are placed in shelters that typically lack resources and educational opportunities. Emerge partners with these shelters and operates a mobile classroom, teaching the girls the business and life skills needed for self-sufficiency. Emerge currently works in three homes with up to 85 teenage girls at a time and aims to expand its operations.
Emerge presented its flagship programme Beads-to-Business to a panel of seven eminent Project Inspire judges. In this programme, girls learn to make high quality jewellery as a therapeutic and practical teaching tool.
The act of creating the jewellery helps girls heal from the trauma they have faced. Jewellery is also used as a hands-on tool to teach business skills. Participants progress through a self-paced workbook that prepares them to start their own small businesses.
The curriculum tackles concepts such as budgeting, inventory management, product development, marketing, branding, and financing. The jewellery created in the programme is sold in outlets such as Barefoot, Buddhi Batiks, and Selyn.
These pieces are also sold at events such as the International Christmas Charity Bazaar which will be held on 29 November at Hilton Residencies. Each unique piece directly benefits its creator, giving these young women a financial foundation on which they can start their adult lives when they exit the shelter.
The Project Inspire prize will help Emerge Lanka expand its programme to a new shelter in early 2016. Project Inspire is an annual impact competition that shines a light on growing organizations who are dedicated to making positive change in the world. Being placed secondamong10 finalists from various countries and cultures is a remarkable feat and a testament to Emerge Lanka's impact. This is no doubt a huge accomplishment for the Emerge Lanka team, but even more so for the many survivors who they support, and who go through tribulations every day.

Fine Fragrances
Unilever's House of Lux, a celebration of the enduring power of Fine Fragrances and all that's feminine, saw a gathering of the elite including beauty queens, film stars, models and socialites, at the Cinnamon Grand on November 16, when this iconic beauty brand once again revolutionized the way women experience fragrances, by infusing it with Fine Fragrances in an exciting range of soaps.
The unique feature of both LUX Soft Touch and LUX Silk Sensation, was the fact that the fragrance for both soaps have been created by Master Perfumers Martin Koh and Stefanus Agung Nugroho, of the reputed House of Firmniche.
Lux as a brand has always been about celebrating and felicitating Fabulous Women and that's exactly what took place on November 16!
The two new re-launched soaps were introduced to Sri Lanka's elite, at a Fine Fragrance extravaganza and sensorial experience, the like of which had hitherto not been experienced in Sri Lanka. The irresistible Fine Fragrances that are the hallmark of LUX Soft Touch and LUX Silk Sensation, are guaranteed to inspire and empower women.
Guests were swept away into an enchanting world of Fine Fragrances and French Roses.
Guests entered a vintage French Rose foyer where they received a Fine Fragrance experience, whilst luxuriating in the luscious beauty that is the hallmark of Lux; simultaneously getting their pictures taken against a beautiful Rose Wall backdrop. The fragrance of Lux filled the room to create a truly memorable sensorial experience for the invitees, while soft, modern, classical music added to the overall theme of romance, luxury and Fine Fragrance .
The Fine Fragrance story was brought to life when Theatre combined with Fashion via a French Rose inspired theatrical fashion show with the country's leading models taking to the catwalk dressed in breathtaking French Rose inspired couture outfits designed by Indeewari and Sammani.
French Rose inspired cakes and refreshments, added to the evening's magical feel.
Amongst the celebrities present were MP Hirunika Premachandra, Deputy Chief of Staff Rosy Senanayake, Hair stylist and Beautician Ramani Fernando, Designers Yolanda Aluwihare, Dharshi Keerthisena, film stars, Nadeesha Hemamali, Sachini Ayendra, Saranga and Umali , Beauty Queens Stefanie Siriwardhana, Singers Bhathiya , Santhush and Dushyanth Weeraman and many others too numerous to mention, all of whom were unanimous in their affirmation of Lux being the most iconic and enduring beauty soap of all time.
"Presently, roses are one of the key dominant elements in fine fragrance concoctions - a definitive and singular tone that takes centre stage" said Ramani Fernando. "Unlike in previous eras of trends and tantalizing scents, a fine fragrance isn't limited to a bottle anymore. That is why Lux is different. Rather than using it sparingly and strategically, Lux's fine fragrances give you the chance to immerse yourself in the perfect scent", said Unilever Sri Lanka's Personal Care Marketing Director, Sharmila Bandara. "At Lux," we work with the world's best perfumers to create beauty treats infused with fine fragrances. Our goal is for each Lux shower to be a delight to the senses, making women feel fabulously feminine, every day".
"Both soaps are unique and unforgettable and are bound to remain amongst the top selling soaps of all time, while the Fine Fragrance that is at the heart of these soaps will ensure it will endure and outlive all other brands of soap," said Lux Brand Manager, Anya Dalpadado.

France mobilises 115,000 security personnel
FRANCE: Following last week's Paris attacks that claimed at least 129 lives, the French authorities have mobilised 115,000 personnel to ratchet up security across the country, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Tuesday.
"We have mobilised 115,000 police, gendarmes and military over the whole of our national territory to ensure the protection of French people," BBC quoted Cazeneuve as saying. He vowed to boost funding for police equipment, which he said had fallen by 17 per cent during 2007-12.
The interior minister added that 128 raids on suspected militants had been carried out overnight on Monday-Tuesday. More than 160 raids were made earlier on Monday, with 23 people arrested and dozens of weapons seized.
French media reported that during the raids police found a safe house used by the attackers in Bobigny, a suburb of Paris.
Earlier on Tuesday, French warplanes carried out fresh strikes against the Daesh stronghold of Raqqa in northern Syria, the army general staff said, destroying a command centre and training centre.
A huge manhunt is under way for 26-year-old Belgian-born French national Salah Abdeslam, one of the key suspects of the attack.
He is believed to have fled across the border to his native Belgium where Belgian police have released more pictures of the wanted man. The Belgian government has raised its terror threat level because of the failure so far to arrest Abdeslam. Tuesday's football match between the national team and Spain has been cancelled as a result.
Investigators are also reported to be focusing on a Belgian of Moroccan descent who is described as the possible mastermind of the attacks.
Abdelhamid Abaoud, 27, lived in the Molenbeek neighbourhood of Brussels, as did two of the attackers, and is now believed to be based in Syria, where he has risen through the Daesh ranks.
Three teams of terrorists on November 13 staged coordinated attacks at six locations across Paris, including a concert hall, the Stade de France and at least two restaurants. At least 129 people were killed and 352 others wounded in the attacks. Two of the total seven dead attackers were identified as Ismael Omar Mostefai, 29, and Bilal Hafdi, aged 20.

Governance: Managing Water Resources for Sustainable Development
Dr. Namika Raby Department of Anthropology California State University-Long Beach-USA
Together with droughts and technical issues, crisis of governance is the third critical dimension associated with managing water resources for sustainable development.
Irrigated agriculture takes up the largest share of water available, in Sri Lanka from where I will recount my experience from, it is reported that 88% of water use is in the irrigated agriculture and livestock (AQUASTAT-FAO Online 20015). Then, water governance issues are paramount in irrigation management. Addressing this as a holistic bottom up process water governance typically covers political, social, economic and administrative systems in place to develop and manage water.
Irrigated agriculture in a majority of cases is in state constructed and operated irrigation systems where farmer organizations have some management tasks at or below the distributary canal of irrigation systems. So, this type of management is really joint management and governance issues must addressed this in a holistic framework.
District Development Committee
Beyond irrigated agriculture, major irrigation systems in Sri Lanka are the water source for, domestic use, ,the environment and even cottage industrial needs (often unaccounted for). Farmer organizations (multifunctional associations as it is in Sri Lanka) are better equipped for the task of monitoring and managing all water use at the local level. In Sri Lanka the legal charter for this organization is in the Irrigation Ordinance 1994 and the Agrarian Development Act 2000.
Training and monitoring of farmers to undertake water resources management in a holistic way in addition to their current tasks at the distributary canal (in Sri Lanka the legal persona of the farmer organization is anchored here) is one way of assuming responsibility and accountability for water use at this level. The conglomerate body of the farmer organization at the irrigation system is a consultative body to the agencies. Herein lays the first management gap. The system level farmer organization in Sri Lankas major irrigation systems can play a more active supervisory and regulatory role in governance jointly with the irrigation bureaucracy. Since the lower tier of the farmer organization, at the field channel is based on the village and homogeneity of kinship and other values, it can be self-supervised and regulated based on community values (done now informally anyhow).
Scaling upwards, all irrigation systems come under the administrative purview of the administrative district and the District Secretary. Times have changed and the functions of the District Secretary as the generalist coordinating a mufti-functional administrative system within the legal parameters of manifold ordinances from colonial times have changed. Given the policy support and political patronage from the centre and the districts, the capacity of the administrator is based on his or her ability to coordinate activities, for example, as the Chair of the District Agricultural Committee (all dimensions of water use and the government departments responsible for it come under the purview of this committee) and secondly under the more politicized District Development Committee.
Coordination defined as concerted action by different entities without loss of organizational identity is possible when it is a composite of many elements, such as leadership, clearly stated and agreed objectives, effective planning.. and good personal working relationships among staff of different departments. United Nations Public Administration Aspects of Community Development (1959: UNDP).
As I have researched this issue in Sri Lanka the success of this mechanism in the Kurunegala administrative district in 2009 hinged primarily on the leadership abilities of the district secretary supported by political will (in this case the chief minister of the province, and the central government), a form of management by results, incorporating task and time management resulted in documented success of coordination in areas including water duty for irrigation; environmentally sustainable home gardens, to controlling deforestation in the Ridi Bendi Ela irrigation system. Identifying optimal conditions for coordination through training, and monitoring of performance, together with some incentive based meritocracy needs to be explored at this level.
None other than Peter Drucker in The Harvard Business Review Special Collection (1968) in his article The Coming of the New Organization held this colonial model as having the potential for transformation into an information based modern organization.
Water governance issues
Moving up to the watershed or river basin, this task of coordination gets more complex. For example, in Huruluwewa, Sri Lankas first watershed management project, an area was 420 square miles. Located within one Province, it included s two administrative districts. The difficulties of coordination at this level resulted in mixed results for this project. In such a situation a regulatory body for water resources (in California we have the State Water Resources Coordinating Board and I have read most recently about the Nebraska Natural Resource District) makes sense.
A legal and policy framework must be in place with water governance issues as a charter for action. A National Water Law and a regulatory body together with already existing apparatus of organizations from the community upwards can create institutions at multiple scales of governance from community managed, bureaucratized, regulatory, to legal frameworks informed by policy. This should be in tandem with a transparent monitoring of this joint governance by a third party or regulatory body is essential for success.
In sum, water governance is integral to governance itself at many levels of the public administrative hierarchy and managers must come to grips with the slippery slope of coordination.

Government switches on Damage control
The Avant Garde controversy appears to have brought out in to the open the divisions within the government, highlighting the fact that the unity in the national government is in fact tenuous and fragile despite the high degree of co-operation between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Last week saw this issue claim its first victim: former Law and Order Minister, Tilak Marapana. Marapana, a former Attorney General and generally highly respected for his legal acumen, had made a statement to Parliament defending some officials involved in the Avant Garde controversy; they had been his clients. This amounted to a conflict of interest and several of his Cabinet colleagues - some of them from the United National Party (UNP) itself - were demanding his resignation.
Vociferous in the criticism of Marapana were ministers Rajitha Senaratne and Champika Ranawaka. The former was freely giving vent to his opinions and these comments earned much publicity because of his role as Cabinet spokesman. Then, the government went in to damage control mode.
Marapana's resignation
Marapana tendered his resignation following discussions with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. The Premier would have been loath to see one of his top legal advisor depart from the Cabinet but he would have also been aware that not to insist on Marapanas resignation would amount to an abandonment of the principles of good governance, coming especially on the heels of a similar controversy involving Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran.
While Marapanas detractors have been critical of his stance on the Avant Garde issue - which he re-iterated in a media briefing after his resignation and in subsequent press interviews - there was general agreement his resignation reflected positively on the government. Differences of opinion are nothing new in a vibrant democracy and Marapanas resignation amounted to a recognition that his position was not in keeping with the concept of collective Cabinet responsibility.
If the government averted a public relations disaster by calling for Marapanas resignation, that wasnt the end of the dispute. By this time, Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe had waded into the controversy saying among other things that he prevented the arrest of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa over the Avant Garde issue.
Rajapakshe was to later qualify his comments stating that he had no objections to Gotabhaya Rajapaksas arrest but he felt that this was uncalled for in this instance. However, the propriety of the Minister of Justice publicly claiming that he prevented the arrest of an individual- when such matters should essentially be the prerogative of the Police and the judiciary- is questionable, especially when this government came into office pledging to eradicate the culture of political interference in the judicial system which was practised by the previous regime.
Rajapakshe is also embroiled in a controversy with former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka, sending each other letters of demand over their comments on the Avant Garde debate. Fonseka is not a sitting member of Parliament but his privileges stripped during the previous government, were restored by President Sirisena and he was promoted Field Marshall. Rajapakshe was to make fun of this title, calling him a vel vidane. This dispute may not amount to much in the end, but it highlights the disparate factions and their divided opinions which are part and parcel of this government.
SLFP parliamentarians
If all this infighting was happening in the UNP corner of the government, all was not well within the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) as well. The factionalism that has dominated the party since the defeat of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the January 8 Presidential election continues to fester.
The latest development comes in the form of some SLFP parliamentarians aligning themselves with a self-styled joint opposition which has now begun to hold media briefings and is publicly questioning the wisdom of the SLFP being part and parcel of the national government.
Besides, two relatively junior parliamentarians, Lohan Ratwatte (Kandy district) and Vidura Wickremenayake (Kalutara district) have challenged President Sirisenas ability to lead the party to victory at future elections, hinting that public support still rests with Rajapaksa. The sons of two former strongmen in the party- late Minister Anurudhdha Ratwatte and former Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickremenayake- their opinions might be the first shots in a volley of further fire.
Matters will come to a head when the party is confronted with the Local Government elections early next year. President Sirisena is already on record saying that he will lead the SLFP campaign at the poll. The President is confident of victory but also wants the party to go it alone, rather than aligning itself with the smaller parties of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), the signature coalition of his predecessor. However, sections of the UPFA are still lobbying for the Alliance to contest together with the SLFP, arguing that any divisions in the so-called anti-government vote would only be advantageous to the UNP.
Adding fuel to the fire is Transport Minister and former Leader of the Opposition Nimal Siripala de Silva. His recent comments that good governance has gone to pieces (yahapaalanaye keltih ne) earned him much publicity but also calls in to question the SLFPs cohesiveness as a political entity.
While critical comments from the likes of Wickremenayake and Ratwatte, ranked lower in the party hierarchy, may not be of great significance, Silvas statements cannot be dismissed lightly. He is a seasoned campaigner and is, most of all, a survivor in the snake pit of SLFP politics.
It is no secret that Silva was one of those sought after by those campaigning for Rajapaksas ouster but he stayed put in the Rajapaksa camp and was a leading light in the former Presidents unsuccessful re-election effort. However, no sooner had Rajapaksa lost, Silva cast his lot with newly elected President Sirisena and was rewarded with the Leader of the Opposition post.
Presidential election
Silva did not hide his prime ministerial ambitions and was making noises to that effect but when there was a clamour from within the SLFP for Rajapaksa to be reinstated as Prime Minister should the UPFA win the August general election, Silva acquiesced, showing his capability to swim with the tide instead clinging on to political principles.
As a minister Silva has time and again irked the UNP, making comments directly antagonistic to the party, thereby jeopardising the working relationship between the two parties which is essential if this government is to achieve its commitments, most of which require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
During the funeral of Ven, Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera the President pledged to abolish the Executive Presidency and on Tuesday, at a ceremony held to grant dual citizenship to Sri Lankans domiciled overseas he re-iterated this promise, adding that proposals to this effect, along with electoral reforms would be submitted to Cabinet. These are indeed the core promises of the government and its mandate could be attributed to the faith the electorate kept in delivering on these pledges. It is heartening to note that the President has not abandoned them one year after he defected from the Rajapaksa government and announced his candidature at the presidential election. However, both the President and the Prime Minister have many miles to travel and more promises to keep before they could rest assured that the concept of good governance is well and truly entrenched in Sri Lankas political culture.

The hanging gardens of Manhattan
*Architectural firm OCA New York imagined stretching the Manhattan skyscraper vertically, adding gaps between every two floors
*Within these gaps are housed luscious green sculptural gardens - spaces that are accessible directly from the building's apartments
*Construction work is expected to begin in April or May of next year, a spokesperson for the developers said
*The tower will be built at 303 East 43rd Street, near the heart of Manhattan, and will be overseen by developers Triangle Assets
A set of stunning skyscraper designs look to combine urban living with the benefit of a suburban-style garden.
The proposals for the gleaming tower include entire floors that are dedicated to hanging gardens, blooming in the sun's rays.
Architectural firm OCA New York imagined stretching the conventional Manhattan skyscraper vertically, adding gaps of around five meters between every two floors. Within these gaps are housed luscious green sculptural gardens - spaces that are accessible directly from the building's apartments.
As a result of adding such spaces, the designs state that every 2,800-square-foot apartment would have around 1,400 square foot of open green space.
The tower will be built at 303 East 43rd Street, near the heart of Manhattan, and will be overseen by developers Triangle Assets.
Construction work is expected to begin in April or May of next year, a spokesperson for the developers said.
The designs that are currently in place will reduce the wind load on the building, provide sufficient sunlight to maintain the green and increase overall natural light - all without sacrificing the endless 360-degree views of the Manhattan skyline.
Manhattan has seen a trend towards ultra-slender residential towers which have been purchased as residential properties or by the private sector.
With this move away from New York's traditional, corporate-dominated skyscrapers, OCA believe there is more room for expression within these towers.
It is hoped that such a residential building will create a new way of urban living, providing some of the external benefits that are lost by living within an inner city apartment.
Eran Chen, the founder and executive director of ODA, said: "There is a huge disconnect between how we live in our cities and what we need, as human beings, for quality of life.
'By 'stretching' the building vertically beyond its original program, we were able to create gaps, 16 feet in height, between every two floors.
'I don't think that we should be forced to choose between enduring in the city or escaping to suburban areas.
'So with all of our projects we look for ways to amplify natural light and provide access to green spaces, and this is the ultimate example.

E M Wijerama Endowment Lecture of the SLMA 2015
INTELLIGENCE AND ITS RELEVANCE TO MEDICINE
Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) hold its Foundation Sessions annually to commemorate E M Wijerama who donated his house to the SLMA. His house now serves as the headquarters of the SLMA. Dr Sunil Seneviratne Epa was invited to deliver the EM Wijerama Endowment lecture of 2015. The speech delivered at the Anuradhapura Hospital Auditorium in the presence of a large gathering of doctors and academics from Rajarata Medical Faculty exhibited a new dimension connecting our religious beliefs and science.
Albert Einstein said, The intuitive mind is a sacred gift,and rational mind a faithful servant. We have created a society that honours the servant, and forgotten the gift. My speech today is on this intuitive mind. Purpose of my lecture is to show you the vast potential of this intuitive mind and how best we can put it to good use. Emotional and Spiritual Intelligence is a function this intuitive mind. Some people refer to this intuitive mind, as subconscious mind. According to some classifications, as much as 88% of our mind is subconscious. What is Intelligence A simple way to understand this abstract term, is to think of it as an ability to apply Skills. We now have a definition of Intelligence which is as follows.
Intelligence is the ability to apply appropriate skills, at right time for right purpose. We have different four types of intelligence. a) Physical b) Cognitive c) Emotional d) Spiritual. If we are to place them in a pyramid, Physical intelligence is at the bottom and is the most basic level. Next is the Cognitive and above that is Emotional, and Spiritual intelligence is at the peak and is the highest form.
Traditionally, the Cognitive intelligence or Intelligence Quotient (IQ)is what we have been referring to as intelligence, at least up to few decades ago. However this trend is now fast changing. Over the years, we have realized that after reaching a certain level of IQ, there is no direct correlation between IQ level, and the actual achievements or success in life. The concept of Emotional intelligence or EQ, emerged as an explanation to this observation. Emotional Intelligence, basically means how skilled you are, in handling emotions, your own or other peoples emotions. EQ is defined as follows.
Ability to make healthy choices based on the ability to recognize, understand and manage, your own feelings and feelings of the others.
Leadership training
Daniel Goleman described EQ as a combination of four different skills under two groups. a) Ability to recognize your own emotions (Recognition) and control them (Impulse control). b) Ability to recognize other peoples emotions (Empathy) and ability to manage them (Soft skills or Social skills). One may be good at one skill but may be poor in another, So if we are to improve our EQ we need to know in which respect we are weaker. EQ can be enhanced by training and as a result it is now a big industry in the US. Studies have shown EQ level is directly related to success in business. Being a good doctor too means having good EQ. Empathy or the ability to understand another persons emotions, is a valued trait for success in medical profession too.
We are dealing with a special category of people with emotional needs. Leadership training essentially means developing good EQ. You may have heard of Gut feeling. This is the feeling based on perception rather than on rational thinking. This is a function of EQ. A surgeon may use his gut feeling whether to operate or not, on a bad patient.
Conventional thinking has been,that emotions are produced by what are called emotional peptides in brain. So it was a chemistry that we talked of. There is however now newer evidence, that these peptides once get attached to the cells, cause a vibration in the cell membranes, producing energy waves with different frequencies. So we are now talking of physics of emotions,producing measurable energy waves with different frequencies.
This brings us to a totally new topic, Cell vibrations. In fact the body is a bundle of energy in constant vibration producing a measurable energy frequencies. Nikola Tesla, who is considered to be the father of electromagnetic engineering said, Everything is vibration and everything is energy. Different emotions have different vibration frequencies ranging from 20- 700 plus Hertz. Negative emotions such as fear anger have lower frequencies while positive emotions such as peace and joy have the highest frequency.
Spiritual activities
Empathy is the ability to perceive another persons emotions. Secret of empathy my lie in the energy waves of emotions. So it looks,we now have a scientific basis for explaining Empathy  the ability to perceive another persons emotions. How strange You may have heard of people who can read other peoples minds. This may be the secret of that too. These emotional vibrations producing energy waves may explain the mechanism of transfer of merit or blessings on to another person by us performing spiritual activities. This is totally a new dimension connecting spirituality with science. Isnt that strange again
Spiritual Intelligence (SQ) is a kind of extension of EQ and is the highest form of human intelligence. We have a definition of Spiritual Intelligence too.It is the ability or the skill to behave with Compassion and Wisdom while maintaining Inner and Outer peace regardless of circumstances.
When people were asked to name a person with these qualities utmost, majority of them thought of their respective religious leaders. I think this is how, the term spiritual came to be coined with this highest form of intelligence. This inner peace component is what distinguishes SQ from EQ. In EQ we are not talking so much about inner peace. A sales man with high EQ may recognize an angry customer and may respond appropriately to calm him down and may succeed in maintaining outer peace. But he may not feel inner peace in himself during this process.
As one progresses from Eq to SQ, the person becomes skilled in maintaining inner peace too. How do you recognize people with high SQ Essentially, they are calm, peaceful, compassionate people. Such people have less stress and conflict both at work and at home. They have better health and better output of work at work places. SQ too can be enhanced by way of training.
We can learn compassion by following the teachings of our religious leaders. Wisdom is a state of heightened inner awareness or tranquility of mind.
It is some thing you need to develop and acquire on your own. Meditation is one way of doing that.
There is now enough scientific evidence to suggest that meditation calms down the conscious brain and reduces ego. It is the ego that makes us lose our inner peace in conflict situations. Functional MRI Scan of brain during meditation has shown that activity of conscious brain and of the limbic system is reduced during meditation. Wisdom dawns as ego becomes thinner.
Ultimate aim of any human being should be to reach the peak of intelligence pyramid or to acquire SQ before death. How do we do that All we need to do is to change the way we think of our own minds. Let me conclude by repeating what Einstein said,
The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and rational mind a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and forgotten the gift.
I leave you pondering how apt it is, what Einstein said over 100 years ago, in our present context today.

Israeli spy set for US release after three decades
US: The United States turns the page on one of the most contentious chapters in its relations with ally Israel when it releases convicted spy Jonathan Pollard on Friday.
Pollard, now 61, an American born in Texas to a Jewish family, has languished for nearly 30 years in prison for passing US secrets to Israel -- but more than that, his lengthy incarceration has hung over Israeli-US affairs for three decades.
A US court jailed Pollard, a Stanford University graduate and former US Navy intelligence analyst, for life in 1987 after he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to deliver national defense information to a foreign government.
Almost 30 years to the day of his arrest on November 21, 1985, Pollard will walk out of a prison in Butner, North Carolina, on parole. He was granted Israeli citizenship in 1995.
His official release date is Saturday, but he will be freed a day earlier in accordance with prison policy, an official told AFP.
The move allows Pollard, who became very religious behind bars, to observe the Jewish Sabbath.
"In (the context of) 67 years of a very special relationship, this is the first case of espionage charges against a US national for the state of Israel in the US, somebody from the US defense establishment, from the intelligence community, also an American Jew," Dan Arbell, from the Center for Israeli Studies at American University, told AFP.
"The American defense establishment over the years has been very sensitive about the information Mr. Pollard allegedly passed on to those he reported to."
Reviled by many Americans, he is a largely popular figure in Israel.
While behind bars, he became an icon of the Israeli right and many Israelis embraced his cause, while the Israeli government has long demanded his release.
As his health deteriorated, Arbell said, calls for his release within Israel intensified -- but the US stance only hardened.
"The feeling amongst Israelis is that he was given a very harsh sentence and harsh treatment," added Arbell. "Perhaps at a certain point he will be allowed to travel and perhaps travel to Israel, but I don't think that it is going to happen any time soon."
Having joined the US Navy, Pollard eventually received sufficient security clearance to access Top Secret and Sensitive Compartmented Information.
Pollard made contact in June 1984 with an Israeli colonel, Aviem Sella, who was pursuing graduate studies at New York University, and offered to provide him with classified information. He soon began supplying a stream of intelligence to the Israelis, reportedly thousands of documents.
Pollard is also alleged to have passed classified information to South Africa, and to have given his then wife Anne documents on China for use in her personal business. Washington later accused Pollard of causing considerable harm to US interests during the Cold War, although the full scope of his take has never been publicly disclosed. He claimed only to have passed information vital to Israel's security that had been withheld by the Americans, but security experts feared the information might have ended up in the hands of the Soviet Union, at the time Washington's arch rival.
"US presidents wanted to set an example that spying on a friendly country should not be tolerated. There was no substantial damage for the US from the actual spying," Michael Brenner, director of the Center for Israel Studies at American University, told AFP.
"For American Jews, it touches on the very sensitive nerve of potential 'dual loyalty' among US Jewish citizens, while for Israel it is a story about the loyalty of relations with its most important partner."
The Pollard affair may go back to the 1980s, but some believe he is still being used as a pawn in modern-day affairs. Contacted by AFP, his lawyers, Eliot Lauer and Jacques Semmelman, refused to comment on the timing of his release. Some believe it may be a conciliatory gesture toward an Israeli government that was irked by the nuclear deal between the West and Iran. Brenner dismissed that notion.

The Kingsbury places Colombo on Global Hospitality Map
The evening can be described as "The Oscars" of the hotel industry and key global players met at the glorious Harbour Grand - Hong Kong to be bestowed their rightful place on the global hospitality map. The World Luxury Hotel Awards aim is to provide luxury hotels with recognition for their world-class facilities, service excellence provided to guests. Thereby giving guests a voice, fuelling the growth and raising service standards within the luxury hotel industry.

The Kingsbury's opulence encased in timeless elegance is a rare find in tropical setting. From Bvlgari amenities to bath & bed products to cutlery & crockery - all have a similar luxurious touch, as do the 450 Red Roses that greet all every day.
Awards are presented to luxury hotels in the categories of country, continent and global basis. The awards judging criteria are based upon facilities and service excellence provided by hotels. Size of a property is not taken into consideration during the nomination or voting phases.
"We're in a phase where tourism is making the world a smaller and a more familiar place. The boundaries are only a state of mind to a seasoned traveller. The tourism product on a global scale is developing in leaps and bounds to accommodate further segmentation. The business traveller is one such segment that's setting the pace in this race and this is truly an honour to Sri Lanka and to all of us at The Kingsbury to have won the best luxury business hotel award for 2015", The Kingsbury Canadian General Manager Scott Mawhinney elated.
The Kingsbury Managing Director and Executive Director Lalin Samarawickremaa member of the Institute of Hospitality UK (formerly HCIMA) and the Royal Society of Health in London, having handed over the reins to Scott in October this year, attributed the award to the hotel team, as their performance has been remarkable year on year. Last year, they made such handsome profits to be able to pay dividends to shareholders in the second year of operation. Lalin, a veteran hotelier with immense international experience said "if you get the basics right, it's not rocket-science, its genuine hospitality that comes from the heart".
The discerning patrons of The Kingsbury are provided with some of the world's best amenities such as "Sealy" mattresses for a blissful night's sleep, Italian "Frette" bed & bath linen for a heavenly in-room experience. The dining experience too is complimented with some of the world's best brands such as German Villeroy & Boch, Spiegelau, Schott Zwiesel and Sambonet from Italy for fine cutlery and crockery.

Lankan maid to be stoned to death: SLBFE appeals
A Saudi Arabian court has sentenced a Sri Lankan woman to death by stoning, after she confessed to committing adultery.
The woman, a mother of two from Colombo was sentenced by a court in Saudi Capital, Riyadh.
The woman reportedly confessed before court to committing adultery with another Sri Lankan expatriate worker.
The Sri Lankan male worker who is involved in the case has been sentenced to 100 lashes.
According to SLBFE sources the woman had migrated to Saudi to work as a domestic worker a few years back.
Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) said that an appeal has already been filed in Riyadh court against the death sentence.
"Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorale is highly concerned. She has instructed our Embassy officials in Riyadh to take all steps possible to save the convicted woman," a spokesman for SLBFE said.
"The SLBFE has also paid the lawyers' fees. We are hoping that the court would revoke the death sentence and issue a lighter sentence," the spokesman said.
According to Saudi law, sentence for adultery is death by stoning. Executions may occur within prison boundaries or in a public square. Meanwhile, the news has already sparked heated debate and outrage on social media.

Laugfs LPG Hambantota import, export terminal agreement signed
Laugfs Terminals, a wholly owned subsidiary of Laugfs Gas signed the agreement with China Huanqiu Contracting and Construction Corporation (HQC) for the turnkey EPC construction of Laugfs LPG Terminal, the first and the largest investment in Hambantota port.
Built with an investment of over US$ 80 million, the Laugfs Terminal will be one of the largest LPG import and export terminals in its class in South Asia in terms of storage capacity, and will be the most strategic in terms of its location, having access to serve a population of around half a billion within neighbouring countries.
"This LPG terminal will be a monumental step in our global expansion plans, which we are aggressively pursuing,and will help further strengthen our energy presence across the region," Laugfs Group Chairman W.K.H.Wegapitiya said.
"Hambantota is a strategic location that sits in the middle of the world's largest nautical/shipping routes with over 50% of the world's nautical traffic. It is also in close proximity to some of the largest emerging LPG markets, including India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Eastern and Southern Africa to name but a few.
The Hambantota port provides global industry facilities, has very generous drafts and can facilitate multiple types of LPG ships. These fantastic location-based advantages combined with our expertise as an energy conglomerate, will garner tremendous benefits not just for the industry, but also for our nation," he further remarked.
Laugfs Group Managing Director Thilak De Silva said the terminal will service vessels from small pressurized vessels to VLGCs (Very Large Gas Carriers)."The terminal will be world class, employing the latest state-of-the-art technologies, equipment and systems, with the capability to export, blend and store LPG with an initial capacity of 30,000 mt."
"We have plans to enhance the capacity with an additional 15,000 MT of LPG, which will boost the handling capacity yield easily to over 100,000 MT and beyond," De Silva said.
With the capacity to accept a very wide variety of LPG vessels for import and export of LPG, the terminal offers utmost flexibility to its customers. It will also have the capability to handle local distribution of LPG through LPG road tanker trucks and will further have an onsite LPG bottling facility.
"This state-of-the-art facility will have its own dedicated LPG pipelines from the terminal to the exclusively allocated jetty at the port. One other very important feature is the compliance to global safety, operations and industry standards. It will have its own fire and total safety systems, which will monitor the site automatically around the clock with some of the most advanced fire safety systems installed including own reserve fire water system. Operations are driven through a very advanced pneumatic system to prompt more safety, HQC Chairman Li Yuping said.

Lines teeming with delight and wisdom
He came all the way from the village of Tawalantanna in Kotmale with his father mother and the sister. We knew him only as a poet but seeing him physically we found him seated in an electronic wheelchair smiling and charming. He was in Colombo to see how his contemporaries discuss his collection of poems titled Viramayakata Pasuva Hamuvemu (Santhava publishers 2015) at the Friday communication discourse of Sri Lanka Press Council in Colombo.
The young poet is Gayan Indula Kodituvakku. He has presented 36 Sinhala poems. Some poems had appeared on facebook and a number of poetry pages of Sinhala periodicals.
All I want is to listen. Just go ahead with what you have got to say about my poetry, he said encouragingly and smilingly.
On reading, I came across a number of good poems worthy of discussion. One, a very brief one, enveloped a sparkling theme as addressed to a flame of fire lighted in a dark room.
I want to ward off the wind entering,
into the abode allowing you to brighten the room, but may you see that you dont create a flaming big fire that burns the eyes of the teeny weeny moths.
Though Kodituvakku had only primary education, he had been diligent to have been a self-made scholar by reading a great deal of books. In his poems you will feel the classical charm of a Sinhala poem. Sometimes he attempts to blend the more spoken Sinhala words with those of the classical works. This could be discerned as a poetic identity of Kodituvakku. This too enables him perhaps to express his poetic experiences more intimately.
In Ayale Giya Vasat Irtuva (The Season of Spring Gone Astray), for instance, he creates a poetic persona. That persona narrates in a tone of sensitive lamentation that a certain image which was a driving force during the season had disappeared with the dawn of a new season.
This is how it goes:
I fail to see the pretty locks of hair of yours I saw once through the shady groves with fallen leaves now. But I feel that the emerged new season had darkened that image, of mine. But I try to uncover failingly to have a glimpse of that image Again and again I try my best to clean the rusty surface of the mirror held in my hand The more and more I do I see that the seasonal times had been a vagrant.
It is accepted that poetry is untranslatable. One misses a certain degree of essence in the original in translation. I find the same about these poems as well. But may it be said in good honour of the poet that the quality of spiritual experiences and the need for a better living condition that he endeavours to embrace is very much alive in his poetry.
In a brilliant piece titled as Indrajalika Pedesaka (In a Magical Area). The poetic persona is more of a fantasy builder. He imagines of a wonderland of magic free from sorrows and agonies.
Then follows a necessity to stick in it. To get rid of that condition, he should immerse his mind and body in that wonderland of magic feeling aloof from the present climate of dismay.
The journey should not be one traversed so far by any other for it may mean a beaten track. As such it should be his own free will utilised as an experienced person journeying all by himself. The purpose is to see that there is a need to immerse the mind and the body in order to be alleviated from the agonies of the present moment.
I felt as if I am enjoying a creative exercise on existentialism, the wisdom on the being and nothingness as visualised by thinkers like Sartre. This poetic creation also visualises the broadening of the borders of poetic expression via new knowledge form and expression.
He too visualises some of the socio political nuances in a different manner with his identity. This, up to some degree, is observed in the poem titled Aragalaya (The Struggle):
The struggle is over now and we smile as a group and singles Red flowers too were sold Time passed by We were perhaps looked down as tramps by some those days Some of us were killed by rivals The swords too were used and some of us lost all our limbs bodily There were barbed wire fences that encircled our dreams
Then came a time when alms too were given to obtain merits.
This kind of poetry deserves much encouragement.

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said that nominations for Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) elections will be accepted from November 24 till December 4.
The Sports Ministry had earlier stated that the date fixed for the SLC election is January 3 and there will be some key changes to the current Sports Law prior to the elections.
SLC is currently administered by an interim committee appointed by previous Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake on April 1 on the grounds that the government wanted to probe alleged corruption and irregularities at SLC under the previous administration headed by Jayantha Dharmadasa.
The International Cricket Council has not been in favour of a government appointed administration running cricket and had been pressing for a democratically elected governing body to be in place before the next ICC meeting scheduled for January 26.
Under pressure from international sports bodies, all the governing bodies of national sports associations and federations, including cricket, key changes had to be made to the Sports Law of Sri Lanka to conform to the constitutions of the respective world sports bodies.
"Accordingly, one of the key changes that will take place will be the controversial four-year rule which barred re-election of any official who has served four years as a major office bearer of a national sports body. The four-year rule will be removed and there will be no secret ballots, voters will have to cast their vote with a show of hands," said the Minister.
"There will be a few more amendments to the Sports Law before it is presented to Parliament in the coming weeks and by next April, all the elections of sports bodies will be conducted according to the new Sports Law which would be passed by the Parliament," the Minister said.

OVIKLO instals drinking water system in A'pura
OVIKLO International, a Logistic Solutions Provision sector in Sri Lanka, was instrumental in installing a water access system in a rural school, struggling to provide access to clean water to its staff and students.
With assistance of Divisional Secretary in Palugaswewa, the Company was able to identify the Galapitagala Vidyalaya in Palugaswava, a school that was enduring considerable hardship as a result of its exceedingly limited access to fresh, clean water. Before the initiative, 180 students and 16 staff members of the Galapitagala School had access to only a single tube well to fulfil their water requirements.
Commenting on the OVIKLO International contribution to the Galapitagala Vidyalaya, School Principal Nalini Damayanthi said, "Our students come from families with very severe financial and social difficulties. Therefore unlike many main District Schools, we can expect very little support from the parents to maintain the school infrastructure and facilities."
"Our water problem was very severe previously so parents who lived close by had to bring water in pots every day in the morning for the children to use during mealtimes. Some little time back we were able to install a tube well to access running water in the school. However the water was often full of grit and couldn't be used for drinking purposes."
The OVIKLO CSR team used its expertise to install a sustainable water access system through a robust tap line system and additionally, donated notice boards, a first aid box and educational materials, as required by the deserving students at the school.
As an an ISO certified company OVIKLO delivers holistic logistic service, and has managed to earn the a stellar reputation for excellence in the fields of warehousing, transport, value added services and project cargo management.
The Company brings the same degree of innovation and fervor to its community outreach programmes as it does to its business operations. The most recent such Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) venture involved re-venturing in to the Palugasweva DS area in Anuradhapura.

Peoples Bank, Inland Revenue to sponsor National Budget Seminar 2016
Peoples Bank recently stepped forward as the principal sponsor of the upcoming National Budget Seminar 2016, which is being organized by the Department of Inland Revenue for the 11th consecutive year.
The event will take place immediately after the budget has been presented in parliament, at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre on Friday 20 November 2015 at 5.30 p.m. and will feature a prominent panel of speakers and guests.
The primary objective of the event will be to educate the taxpaying community including business leaders, professionals and entrepreneurs, on the many benefits that proper taxation rates and policies will have on the economic development of the country and the social well-being of its people.
Ravi Karunanayake, the Minister of Finance will grace the occasion as the Chief Guest and keynote Speaker along with the Guest of Honour, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, the State Minister of Finance.
Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga, the Secretary to the Treasury will also be present along with Kalyani Dahanayake, the Commissioner General of the Department of Inland Revenue and D.G.P.W Gunathilake, Deputy Commissioner General, who will present key insights on the budget.
Senior representatives of the key national chambers of commerce in Sri Lanka and chartered accountancy and finance firms as well as the countrys top corporate leaders will also be in attendance.
Commenting on the importance of the seminar, Kalyani Dahanayake, Commissioner General, the Department of Inland Revenue said, Taxation is one of the most important yet controversial issues in the economic policy.
In a nutshell, taxation is the price that we pay for the country that we want. Tax is the main source of revenue generation for many countries and helps to raise funds that support the countrys economic and financial development, whilst fulfilling social requirements such as the provision of proper law enforcement, medical and transport services.
She further added, Tax policies do not have to be excessive; they have to adequately fit the countrys requirements and strengthen key sectors to help us achieve our development goals.
Taxation also helps to promote the welfare of the people and uplifts society, it helps to promote the development of various new sectors especially export industries and it helps the country achieve continued growth.
We are grateful for the support that Peoples Bank has provided us with and hope that this seminar will help create awareness about the benefits of taxation and spread a positive message that will reach all corners of Sri Lanka.
A live simulcast of the seminar will enable taxpayers in Matara, Kurunegala and Jaffna to also gain a thorough understanding of the budget and its tax implications.
PEO TV, the official media sponsor of the event has made it possible for all the key information discussed at the seminar, to reach audiences in the North and East of the country for the very first time.
Throughout the seminar, an in-depth analysis of the budget and interpretations as well as legal clarifications regarding the new taxation policy will also be presented and comprehensive documentation outlining a compilation of tax rulings will be provided.
The seminar will end with a Q&A session where participants will be able to clarify their queries.
The National Budget Seminar 2016 will give the taxpaying community a greater understanding of complex budgeting mechanisms and their impact on taxation policies.

Plans to revive roof tile,clay industry
Sri Lanka Ceramics and Glass Council plans to take immediate measures to resurrect the local red clay ceramic products (building bricks and roof tile) industry.
Speaking at the 12th Annual General Meeting of Sri Lanka Ceramics and Glass Council President Mahendra Jayasekera said the council has already taken measures to re-open all the closed down factories across the island.
There were over 500 brick and roof tile manufacturing factories in the country using red clay for manufacturing in Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, due to lack of incentives given by the relevant authorities to develop the industry, around 300 factories closed down their operations over the last 20 years.
Jayasekera also expressed his satisfaction over the governments move to ban the use of asbestos roofing sheets in the country by 2018. He said the ban will help revive the red clay roof tile manufacturing industry to a greater level.
Jayasekera said the council has been lobbying government policymakers with regard to the issues faced by the ceramic industry.The Centre for Technical Excellence in Ceramics (CENTEC) jointly with the Sri Lanka Ceramics and Glass Council is working closely with the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) to introduce the SLS mark to the red clay ceramic products such as building bricks and roof tiles.
CENTEC has currently singed up with over 20 red clay roof tile and building bricks manufacturing companies to implement Sri Lanka standards with regard to system certifications in their factory. With the implementation of SL standards, the council is intending to improve the productivity, yields while bringing down the cost of production and making the local companies more competitive in the market place.
The council is also closely working with Industry and Commerce Ministry and the Agrarian Services Department to solve issues with regard to the mining of raw materials.
He said the government support must be given to resolve outstanding issues with regard to the mining of raw materials to take the industry forward as an environmentally friendly and sustainable industry.

Police hunt Paris gunman - but are there others
FRANCE: Police on Tuesday stepped up a Europe-wide hunt for the Paris attackers after video confirmed a ninth man may also have taken part in the worst attacks in French history.
Investigators are hunting the suspect for his part in the carnage that left 129 people dead, after footage showed a third man in a car used in one of the attacks on bars and cafes in central Paris.
He could be one of two suspects being held in Belgium or on the run -- possibly with 26-year-old Salah Abdeslam, who carried out the shootings along with his suicide-bomber brother Brahim.
Belgian police failed to find Abdeslam during a raid in Brussels on Monday, while a subsequent sighting of him in Germany turned out to be a wild goose chase.
In claiming responsibility for the attacks, the Islamic State group said eight men were involved.
As the manhunt continues, investigators are seeking to pinpoint when, where and how France's worst-ever attacks were organised, and whether more accomplices are running free.
How the gunmen communicated, where they travelled and how they planned Friday's attacks is key to the probe.
On Tuesday, police found a black Renault Clio rented under Abdeslam's name in a northern district of the French capital. It had been spotted on the A1 motorway that heads north from Paris.
His bank card was also used to rent two hotel rooms in the northern suburbs days before Friday's attacks at the national stadium, a concert hall and restaurants and cafes, police sources said.
But it remains unclear how one of the gunmen, French national Samy Amimour, returned to Europe from Syria without being detected given he is wanted under an international warrant.
Or why Belgian police failed to notify their French counterparts that the Abdeslam brothers, who had been living in Brussels, had been flagged as radical Islamists.
Two of the three suicide bombers whose bodies were found at the Bataclan concert hall, the site of the worst carnage where 89 people were killed, grew up in France.
Amimour, 28, grew up in Drancy, a poor immigrant area northeast of Paris, and worked as a suburban bus driver. He was charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism in October 2012, but violated his bail, leaving for Syria almost a year later.

[Young Voices]
The questions he 'never' asked JR!
'Young Voices from Diyawanna' features statesman Dr. Kavinda Jayawardana who is very much a change maker with vision. Jayawardana, who is a far seeing astute leader, discussed his passion which is his country.
Early Life
Son of one time parliamentarian and Minister of Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Refugees Dr. Jayalath Jayawardana, Dr. Kavinda Jayawardana did his studies at Royal College till his O/Ls and after his O/Ls attended an international school. After his A/L he got through to Sri Ramachandra Medical College in India and graduated as a doctor in 2011. He worked there till 2012, and came back to the island and practiced in two hospitals in Sri Lanka.
After his father's demise, with the request from his father's supporters, political friends and family, he joined politics, contesting for the Western Provincial Council and becoming number two in the district.
He was a Western Provincial Counsellor for a year and a half, and joined the National Youth Front becoming the Secretary for Human Rights at the National Youth Front and is Deputy National organizer for the National Youth Front which is the Youth League in the United National Party. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe and the UNP party wanted him to contest for the general election from the Gampaha district. He contested for the general election and as the youngest Member of Parliament from Gampaha district he was able to get selected to parliament.
In class and in the territory of the fairer sex!
"At Royal College the most fun time is the big match time. And during that period we had the cycle parade and we used to jump into girls' schools for fun! There were a few incidents where we jumped into a couple of girls' schools - St. Bridget's, Ladies and HFC. And some of my friends got caught to the Police and got themselves into trouble. But I was always able to escape and it was fun! In school we were very united. Even if one of our mates did something naughty, we never let him down. The entire batch and class would get punished rather than let the boy down.
Secret to success
My secret to success is dedication and commitment. I identify what is important and what my priorities are. Other than that, it would be my father's blessings. I watched and learnt how my father did politics and how he got close to people. All those things gave me a lot of lessons in life and I am very determined to carry on my father's work and I think it is on my shoulders now. So right now it is a duty for my nation and the people of my country.
Identifying the country's strength and requirements
Sri Lanka is one of the best tourist destinations in the world. We need a proper plan and strategy for tourism. There will be tourists who want to see only the beach. There will be tourists who want only to go to the jungle and see the leopards and birds. There will be tourists who want to come here to read books, rest, relax and look at the scenery. They may even like to go to Adam's Peak and World's End. There will be tourists who want to go to Jaffna and see the development and lifestyles of Jaffna. So you can make a package for them.
If we can make them more comfortable, we will have more tourism flooding into Sri Lanka.
There is also a huge number of Sri Lankans living abroad. We are losing a lot of Sri Lankan young blood in their prime. They are working for somebody else and most of them are abused and even end up losing their lives. And it is breaking the livelihoods of families in Sri Lanka. If we get them down and give them opportunities to work in Sri Lanka, then that would be a better way.
Challenges in life
The challenges I have faced is the health sector in Sri Lanka. As a doctor a lot of patients come to us. Most of them find it difficult to buy their medicine. And some of the patients, when they have to undergo a bypass surgery, they have to be in the list and have to wait forever sometimes. So we feel very helpless because there are less opportunities for them to survive. If we can upgrade the system for them, that would be good.
The hospitals have to be upgraded and the doctors have to be given a decent salary. The medical staff needs their facilities. We have to be conscious of the quality of the drugs. Some hospitals don't have equipment and they don't even have the required number of beds.
Message to the youth
My message to the youth of Sri Lanka is that first you have to have a dream -who you want to become and what you want to do for the country because you have a responsibility towards your country. You have to work towards your goal, your mission and you have to be determined. You should never give up. And do the right thing all the time.
Chatting with a historical figures
I would love to talk to J.R. Jayawardene and I want to ask him why he wanted this preferential voting system and why he implemented that. I also want to ask him why he wanted this Global Economy because he was the one who opened the international market in Sri Lanka by doing that.
He took the entire country to another level. When it comes to international leaders, I would like to talk to Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. I want to ask them how they managed to be so patient when everyone was attacking them!
Love conquers all
If I was omnipotent and could change anything in the world I would eradicate racism, terrorism, violence, hatred and religious extremism. Secondly I would eradicate cancer, drugs and heart attacks!
Historical figures he considers exemplary
When it comes to historical figures I admire Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. They were against violence when the violence was at the optimum level.
A day that changed his life
The one day that changed my life was when I lost my father. If I could live with my father for longer, then that would have been good. If I knew things would go bad I would have spent more time with him.
Walking through history
If I went back in history I would change Black July and those 30 years of war from ever happening.
Of movies
When it comes to movies I like ones based on true stories like 'Blow' (based on the true story of a drug trafficker) and 'The Walk to Remember' and I watch a lot of the history channel - Saddam Hussein, Idi Amin and Gaddafi and Hitler's life story. All of these are documentaries. I used to watch a lot of TV shows like 'Lost,' 'Prison Break,' 'Friends' and 'Two and a Half Men.'
Love life
I dated a girl next door, I used to go to church to meet her every Sunday. I was in school back then. Sunday was the best day of my life because at mass I got to see her. So we would hold hands in church and attend mass. She was my first love and we exchanged letters and pictures. We didn't have mobile phones back then, so we would talk over the land line.
It was very hard for me to get away from my mother and talk to this girl. I used to walk all the way from Royal College to the British Council with a pay phone card. For 100 rupees I talked to her for five minutes and walked back to Royal College and got into my vehicle to go home. Once I even collected money for Valentine and bought her a ring. That was the best gift I could get for her back then, because I was not doing a job.
Prophesying a possible future
The fear that I have is, with technology evolving so much, we will lose touch of each other. We will lose the touch of humanity. We will lose the touch of family. We will be robots one day. The technology will take us over, we will not be human we will be robots. And we will stop drinking water and stick to Cola. We will stop eating green vegetables, rice and bread and we will start eating pizza for the rest of our lives. We will be so lazy we will not even turn the fan on. We will be too lazy to get into the bus or the train. We will be obese and our life span will be shorter. We will have physical and mental problems and we will be stagnated to one place.
Emotional moments
The Tsunami that hit our country was an incident that moved me. Another event that moved me was 9/11. Right now I am pretty upset about what is happening in Syria with innocent people being tortured, murdered and girls being taken for sex slavery. I was very much moved when I saw the lifeless little body of the little Syrian boy washed up at the sea shore. I can't believe humans are doing this.

Ronda Rousey breaks silence after loss to Holly Holm Ill be back
After Holly Holm defeated Ronda Rousey at UFC 193, everyone had something to say about it.
Even Donald Trump gave his opinion on the outcome of the fight. But one person who has been quiet throughout since the fight is Rousey herself. On Sunday night, she posted rather cut-and-dry update on Instagram. It said:
I just want to thank everyone for the love and support. I appreciate the concerns about my health, but Im fine.
As I mentioned before, Im going to take a little bit of time, but Ill be back.
Its safe to say that Rousey will be keeping a low profile until her next fight is announced or when she begins filming the Road House remake, which she is starring in.

[Archworld]
See, feel and learn
Rome wasn't built in a day or so they say! It started in bricks when it all began in 753B.C. according to Roman Mythology, maybe even years before. Rome was a city state and an empire while Sri Lanka is an island with a civilization as old as 2500 years. Regardless of the differences Architecture is Architecture whether in Rome or Sri Lanka. Today also Arch World speaks to Channa Daswatte who takes us through the highlights of living in Sri Lanka.
"The inward looking urban house has often been the model though of busy urban environments from Roman times where congested cities were part of the culture.
Homes are essentially places which people retreat to, from the distractions of the outside. There should always be places that do that within the house. In old style urban houses one had verandahs overlooking the streets and outside so that the occupants could connect with the outside but internal courtyard spaces allowed them to retreat into a place that did not have that connection. Today's urban houses are similar. High walls lee the outside out," said Channa
The offspring of Mother Nature which is greenery and water can be incorporated into the home operating as a balm when one comes back tired from a hard day at work.
"I don't particularly try to incorporate water and greenery, but it goes without saying that in
Sri Lanka, greenery is inevitable. My work makes an effort to connect with the environment
outside and try to make the occupants conscious of their surroundings. This makes for the
spaces being very much a part of the greenery. Water can happen either as a pond or pool that occupants may request and also how you control the rain. Watching and hearing the monsoon from a sheltered and dry space, is in my opinion one of the highlights of living in Sri Lanka."
Feathers in his cap
Daswatte has many trophies in the form of houses. Some more memorable than others but all are feathers in his cap.
"Of my work, two small projects are perhaps my most memorable and most important to me.
Renovating a hundred year old bungalow and the junior school of Methodist College taught me the importance and joy of recycling old buildings.
Many other projects followed, such as the Dutch House in Galle and the Kandy House, but this was where I cut my teeth on conservation and addition to give new life to a building.
And of course building my own home in Madiwela. Here I explored many ideas that I always had in my mind and it has since been a joy to live in."
Custodian
A house can be a custodian of interpersonal relationships with all its dynamics, are all taking place within the house. "A house comes alive not so much with the inhabitants or occupants interacting with the
house, than by how the house allows the occupants to interact between themselves. Houses
by the way they are designed, can allow for individuals within it to either avoid or interact
with each other preserving levels of privacy and connection. This is especially true in today's
society where the individual and individual aspirations are as important as the joint aspirations of family and community."
Architecture is finally a labor of love for any architect. When you are in the thick of it, it is almost impossible to let go.
"It's difficult to disengage from thinking about a piece of architecture when you are into it.
But the good thing is designing is always a pleasure. Procurement is always stressful. Here
you are doing what you can to make the various people involved in a project understand the
vision you have in mind.
Steps
First it's how you interpret it as a drawing sketch. Next it gets interpreted by a technical person that might then be passed on to a contractor whose craftsman or bricklayer must lay the material in the right place and order. This is the stress. But the solution to this is usually to have worked with people who understand the ideas in your mind and hopefully interpret correctly.
This is both physically and mentally challenging. But that bit is what I consider work and often try not to take it home!
If the architect takes on board the variety brought in by the individuality of the client, the context, the specifics of the environment and its effects on the site, there is enough means by which a house will be naturally different from others. It's not tiring or exacting, it's what I enjoy most." The diversity of it is what is so addictive - the challenges that come with the diversity. That is the joy of any profession and particularly architecture. Each day and each problem is
different. Each person means a different negotiation. This keeps Channa alert and happy!
Learning everyday
"You learn every day from the work you do and from what you see. Yes magazines
tell you what other people are doing, what new shapes and forms are coming out and different solutions to different architectural problems around the world.
But for me what I see and feel the actual experience of architecture is the best way to learn. So all my holidays are travelling to new places and having experiences, like when walking through a land- scape, a town, a house - those are my greatest learning experiences.
I don't do trends. They are usually very short lived and transient. Architecture to me is a
bit more than this. It is timeless, so any passing trend can fit in and fade around it. Interior designs can be trendy and occasionally when I do put on that hat, I do accommodate the transient trends in it. In hotels for instance they change every 5 years! But architecture cannot really do that, it will be economically illogical and harmful to the environment," he noted finally.

SriLankan Cargo revolutionises air freight from the Middle East
SriLankan Cargo will revolutionise air freight to Colombo from seven cities in the Middle East with the launch of its 'A Dollar A Kilo!' service this month.
The new service has been especially designed to cater to the needs of Sri Lanka's migrant workforce in the Middle East, who often send gifts,baggage and other items back home through sea freight. The service has no restrictions on size and weight, and can be used by anyone to send anything from the Middle East to Colombo.
Apart from its remarkably low cost, with a fee of USD 1 per kilogramme with no hidden charges, this service will also provide the greatest level of convenience, with packages being picked up from the very doorsteps of customers in the Middle East. Customers simply need to call up the SriLankan Airlines office in their respective city, and the package will be picked up within hours.
The service is being made available to customers in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Kuwait, Dammam, Riyadh and Jeddah. SriLankan currently operates 42 flights a week between these cities and Colombo.
"SriLankan Cargo, together with our parent company SriLankan Airlines, salutes the efforts of hundreds of thousands of our countrymen and women living and working throughout the Middle East.
Theirvital remittances form one of the largest segments of our nation's economy. This is our way of saying 'Thank you' to all of them," Cargo Head at SriLankan Chamara Ranasinghe said.
"We are constantly searching for new and innovative methods by which to serve our customers. We identified this important market segment, and are offering them a value for money service that is both cost-effective and fast from their point of view. Speed is an especially relevant factor, and SriLankan Cargo will deliver within two days. In comparison, sea freight may take up to a month," Ranasinghe said.
Two shipping agents have been appointed by SriLankan Cargo as its partners in this venture. Laksiri Seva (Pvt) Ltd will handle freight coming from Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Dammam and Riyadh, while Middle East Cargo International (Pvt) Ltd (Midco)will do the same for packages from Doha and Jeddah. Both companies have their warehouses in Sri Lanka at Peliyagoda from which the packages can be picked up.

Suspected architect of Paris attacks is dead, 2 senior European officials say
The suspected ringleader of the Paris attacks was killed Wednesday in a massive pre-dawn raid by French police commandos, two senior European officials said, after investigators followed leads that the fugitive Islamic State militant was holed up north of the French capital and could be plotting another wave of violence.

More than 100 police officers and soldiers stormed an apartment building in Saint-Denis, a bustling suburb home to many immigrants, during a seven-hour siege that left at least two people dead, officials said. The dead included the suspected overseer of the Paris bloodshed, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, according to the two senior European officials. Abaaoud, a Belgian extremist, had once boasted that he could slip easily between Europe and strongholds of the Islamic State militant group in Syria.

Paris prosecutor Franois Molins, speaking to reporters hours after the siege, said he could not provide the identities of the people killed at the scene. A French security official declined to confirm or deny that Abaaoud had died. U.S. officials said they were awaiting confirmation of the identities of those slain.

The two European officials from different countries, who have followed the case closely, said they had received the information about Abaaouds death from French authorities. The two officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.

It was not immediately clear how Abaaoud died  whether in police gunfire, by his own hand or in a suicide blast triggered by a woman in the apartment.

After the raid, forensics experts combed through blown-out windows and floors collapsed by explosions, presumably seeking DNA and other evidence.

Molins said a discarded cellphone helped identify safe houses used by attackers to plan Fridays coordinated assaults, which killed 129 people and wounded more than 350 in a series of attacks at a stadium, a concert hall and restaurants across Paris.

Molins said police launched the raid after receiving a witness tip suggesting that Abaaoud was entrenched on the third floor of the Saint-Denis building. He said that neither Abaaoud nor another wanted suspect, Salah Abdeslam, was among eight people who were arrested at the apartment and surrounding locations on Wednesday. Three people were arrested in the raid itself, one of whom suffered a gunshot wound in the arm, he said.

Molins said the sophisticated militant cell used three safe houses around Paris  including the Saint-Denis apartment  and three rental cars to launch the attack. It was a huge logistics plan, meticulously carried out, he said.

Abaaoud was the target of a major dragnet in the international search  which stretches from Belgium to Syria  for suspects in Fridays carnage.

Supporters of the Islamic State, the extremist group whose vast domain straddles Syria and Iraq, have vowed to inflict repeated attacks on the West, including in Europe.

The raid was in part a response to what French officials thought was a plan to stage a follow-up terrorist attack in La Defense, a financial district northwest of Paris, two police officials and an investigator close to the investigation said. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief members of the media.

Seven men and one woman were arrested Wednesday in Saint-Denis, Molins said.

Five days after the worst violence on French soil since World War II, European nations remained on edge, enhancing vigilance against possible attacks by Islamist militants who have promised to bring the brutal tactics employed in Iraq and Syria to the West.

[Why French airstrikes on ISISs capital probably havent done much ]

President Franois Hollande, seeking to reassure French citizens unnerved by the bloodshed on the streets of Paris, said the attacks would not alter the French way of life.

We are at war against terrorism, terrorism which declared war on us, Hollande said at a meeting of French mayors. It is the [Islamic State] jihadist organization. It has an army. It has financial resources. It has oil. It has a territory.

It has allies in Europe, including in our country, he continued, with young, radicalized Islamist people. It committed atrocities there and wants to kill here. It has killed here.

He renewed his case to extend a state of emergency decreed after the attacks and to make changes to the constitution that he said would make France safer.

Jean-Michel Fauvergue, chief of the elite police unit that carried out Wednesdays raid, said the operation began at 4:16 a.m. with an attempt to blast open the third-floor apartment door with explosives. But the reinforced door would not open properly, and the element of surprise was lost, he said. The terrorists inside then blocked the door with a heavy object.

French media identified the suicide bomber as Hasna Aitboulahcen, a cousin of Abaaouds. The 26-year-old French citizen is a former manager of Beko Construction, a company in Epinay-sur-Seine, a town north of Saint-Denis. The company closed down in 2014.

Fauvergue said hundreds of shots were exchanged and each side threw projectiles.

As the raid progressed, heavily armed police clad in military gear  some with their faces covered by balaclavas  moved quickly through the dark streets, while sharpshooters were posted on nearby buildings. Helicopters scanned from the skies, and police used a drone and two robots to conduct surveillance. For hours, traffic and public transportation were halted, and schools were shuttered.

Uthayaseelan Sanmugan, a 38-year-old cook who lives near the targeted apartment, said he woke up at 4:30 a.m. to the sound of gunfire, went to his window and saw the lights from weapons outside.

When I got to the street, I saw a lot of blood on the sidewalk. The blood of the terrorists.

Residents were evacuated or instructed to stay inside their homes.

I heard gunshots and, sometime around 7 a.m., a huge blast, an explosion, said Kelly Ovo, a 45-year-old day laborer who lives close to the apartment that was under siege.

French police reported that a 7-year-old police dog named Diesel was killed by the terrorists in the raid.

Abaaoud, an ardent Islamic State supporter linked to several other terrorist attempts, was believed to be in Syria earlier this year. But some officials speculated earlier this week that he could have returned to Europe, perhaps passing undetected among the flood of asylum seekers pouring into Greek islands from Turkey.

The siege appeared to have been aided by another potential breakthrough in the probe: the discovery of a mobile phone in a garbage can near the Bataclan concert hall, the site of one of Fridays assaults.

The phones data contained a map of the music venue, which was the target of the most deadly attack last week. French media reported that the phone contained a chilling text message sent shortly after the first gunman entered: Lets go, were starting.

The information on the phone opened fresh leads, including to an apartment southeast of Paris in Alfortville, according to Mediapart, a French news outlet.

French officials have cast a wide net in the hunt for suspects in Fridays attacks. Across France, 118 additional raids were conducted overnight on Tuesday, yielding at least 25 arrests. That brought to 414 the number of raids launched throughout France since Friday, the Interior Ministry said.

The attacks deepened questions about European intelligence agencies ability to prevent militant violence. According to Eric Van Der Sypt, spokesman for the Belgian federal prosecutor, Belgian federal police interrogated Brahim Abdeslam, one of the Paris attackers, in February after he returned from Turkey.

Belgian federal police also questioned Brahims brother Salah, who they knew had been radicalized, Van Der Sypt said. But Belgian officials said there was no indication that the brothers were going to get involved with terrorism, so they were released.

Across Europe, officials remained on high alert Wednesday. In Copenhagen, a terminal at the Danish capitals international airport was briefly evacuated after an overheard conversation about a bomb, police said in a Twitter post. The terminal later reopened.

Countries, including Sweden and Italy, raised terror alerts. At the Vatican, extra security was posted in St. Peters Square, where Pope Francis addressed pilgrims.

On Tuesday, authorities in Hanover, Germany, abruptly called off a friendly soccer match between Germany and the Netherlands that Chancellor Angela Merkel had planned to attend, officials said.

Turmoil continued elsewhere in France on Wednesday when a history teacher at a Jewish school in Marseille was stabbed by three men. Brice Robin, the Marseille prosecutor, said one of the attackers had an Islamic State T-shirt. The teacher received medical aid and appeared to be in stable condition.

Also in Marseille, a young veiled Muslim woman was attacked by a man who punched her and wielded a box cutter. She was taken to an emergency room.

Since last weeks attacks, Hollande has vowed a withering French response. On Tuesday, France invoked a European Union mutual aid pact that calls for members of the bloc to assist other member states if they are attacked, a historic if largely symbolic move. (washingtonpost)

Syrian journalist, Turkish paper win French media freedom prizes
FRANCE: A Syrian journalist who lives and works in the war-scarred city of Aleppo was awarded the Reporters without Borders Prize in France on Tuesday for her defence of press freedom.
The Paris-based media rights group singled out Zaina Erhaim for her determination and courage in covering the conflict in Syria, which is deemed the most dangerous country in the world for journalists.
Over the past two years Erhaim has trained around a hundred print and television journalists, a third of them women. Her efforts have led to the emergence of a number of independent newspapers and magazines.
Her uncle accepted the prize on her behalf at a ceremony in the French city of Strasbourg.
Reporters without Borders (RSF) also honoured centre-left Turkish newspaper Cumhuriyet, which won the watchdogs Media of the Year prize for its independent and courageous journalism.
In May, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan brought a criminal complaint against the paper for publishing a video it said showed a convoy of vehicles bound for Syria with weapons supplied by the Turkish intelligence agency.
Erdogan vowed the papers editor-in-chief would pay a heavy price for the report which raised questions about Turkeys involvement in the Syrian conflict.
The paper was also the first in the Muslim world to reprint parts of the first Charlie Hebdo issue -- featuring a controversial cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed -- released after Januarys deadly Islamist attacks on the French satirical magazine in Paris.
RSFs Citizen Journalist of the Year award went to Zone 9, an Ethiopian bloggers collective that regularly denounces rights abuses in the east African country.

UK's coal plants to be phased out within 10 years
Image copyright PA Image caption Amber Rudd said the government was tackling a legacy of underinvestment and ageing power stations
The UK's remaining coal-fired power stations will be shut by 2025 with their use restricted by 2023, Energy Secretary Amber Rudd has announced.
Unveiling the government's new energy strategy, Ms Rudd said that relying on polluting coal is perverse.
In a speech later today it is expected she will announce gas will become central to the UK's energy supply.
Environmental groups welcomed the move away from coal but criticised plans to focus on gas instead of renewables.
Safe and reliable'
Currently, coal provides almost a third (28%) of the UK's electricity, but Ms Rudd said We are tackling a legacy of underinvestment and ageing power stations which we need to replace with alternatives that are reliable, good value for money and help to reduce emissions.

Ms Rudd is also expected to say that investment in nuclear power is vital to the government's policy.
She believes that plans for new nuclear power stations, including at Wylfa in Wales and Moorside in Cumbria, could provide almost a third of the low carbon electricity the UK needs for the next 15 years.
Opponents of nuclear misread the science. It is safe and reliable, Ms Rudd will say.
The speech comes amid concerns that the UK could suffer from blackouts as a result of short supplies, brought about in large part from the closure of a number of power stations that have come to the end of their working lives.
However, National Grid and many experts have dismissed these concerns.
Analysis: John Moylan, BBC industry correspondent
Successive governments have highlighted our energy dilemma - the need to keep the lights on, while cutting greenhouse gases and ensuring energy is affordable for consumers.
Today the Energy Secretary Amber Rudd will focus on energy security and keeping prices as low as possible.
But for the world's first industrialised nation to end coal-powered generation sends a strong signal ahead of the UN Climate summit in Paris.
All the major parties had signed up to phasing out coal. The previous government's projections saw it falling to 1% by 2025.
The big question is how to ensure gas plants are built to replace it. Only one large plant is under construction today. Another, which secured a subsidy last year, is struggling to find investors. Image caption The new energy system will be competition-focused, according to Amber Rudd Concerns have also been raised about the costs to consumers of transforming the energy system to help tackle climate change.

Veteran actor Saeed Jaffrey dies at 86
Phenomenal Indian-British actor Saeed Jaffrey is no more! The actor's niece Shaheen Aggarwal took to the social networking site to pay an ode to this gem of a person! She wrote "Today, a generation of Jaffreys has passed away. Saeed Jaffrey has joined his brothers and sister and is rejoicing in the lap of his Heavenly Father, eternally. The entire Jaffrey Family bids you, 'adieu', you beautiful, beautiful man. See you in heaven!"
Although the actual cause of Jaffrey's death is yet to be known but the loving niece wants everyone to cherish all his good times, good deeds. She even shared excerpts from one of his brilliant interviews, letting the world know the kind of a person Jaffery was! Especially this bit which said, "Saeed Jaffrey has two careers: he's well-known in Britain, and he's huge in India. Jaffrey is moist, engaging, round: he leaks expressiveness from every pore. He has quite a repertoire of hand gestures. There's the stately sweep of the palm, the defiant index finger that precludes any objection, and the equivocal fluttering of fingers as if he's practising scales. Watching Little Napoleons you see that he almost doubles the size of his role by giving his fingers a lot to say. He's a small man with a large physical presence: he has immaculate silver hair, a glint of cunning in his eyes, and a cartoon-like nose. Whether in Tandoori Nights, The Jewel in the Crown, The Far Pavilions or Staying On, Jaffrey has a Dickensian skill for investing self- importance, greed or slyness with a fullness of feeling that makes them sweetly human."
Saeed Jaffrey was best known for his roles in films like Dil, Kishan Kanhaiya, Ghar Ho Toh Aisa, Raja Ki Aayegi Baarat, Deewana Mastana, Mohabbat, Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai, Aunty No 1 and Albela among other Hindi movies
