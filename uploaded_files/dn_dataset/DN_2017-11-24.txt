Over 250 schools lack qualified teachers
About 253 national schools countrywide are functioning without qualified school principals at present and hence, the Education Ministry has taken steps to fill these existing vacancies early, next year, as per a decision of Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam. Accordingly, the Education Ministry has already sought the approval of the Educational Commission of the Public Service Commission for this purpose.
Several leading teachers unions too had pointed out the necessity of appointing qualified and experienced heads who have principals grades to these national schools early to ensure the proper handling of administration of these schools, said Kurunegala Senior Director of Education W. M. Balasooriya speaking at a meeting of deputy principals of government schools held yesterday at the Wariyapola Teachers Resources Centre, Kurunegala.
Balasooriya said that certain school principals of popular and leading schools in both Kurunegala and Puttalam districts of the North Western Province (NWP) are reported to have solicited gratifications and undue donations from parents for admitting grade one students to their schools next year.
Proper investigations would be conducted accordingly with regard to those complaints against school heads and such errant school heads would be dismissed from their posts immediately according to the new rules and regulations introduced by the government, as they gravely tarnish the good and respectable image of this noble profession and the Education Ministry, he added.
About 746 deputy school principals participated in this meeting.

Ayurveda doctors  discriminated  - President
Practitioners in traditional medicine and Ayurvedic doctors face class discrimination in our society which has given more recognition to a man in a suit who practises western medicine, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was speaking at the inaugural session of the International Symposium on Traditional and Complimentary medicine (Tradmed) yesterday.
The three day symposium held at Waters Edge, Battaramulla attracted companies, researchers and practitioners in traditional and complementary medicine from the USA, UK, Australia, Singapore, Japan, China, India, South Korea, the Netherlands, Iran and Thailand.
The man who wears a short sleeved shirt, sarong and slippers is not taken seriously, his knowledge is not given prominence, continued the President as he addressed the gathering.
In many countries around the world, prior to the advent of Western medicine, people practiced indigenous medicine and traditional healing methods. But with globalization, they embraced modernity, and research into Western medicine grew. We all gave more prominence to Western medicine, for our own convenience rather than improve our own indigenous medicines, the President added.
The President also recalled an incident where individuals practicing Hela medicine had approached him to be registered to practice their skill since officials in the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medicine who were doctors in western medicine, did not take their profession seriously.
I have instructed Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne to look into this issue, he said.
The President also stressed that the symposium should not only be a place to exchange knowledge but also a place where they would discuss methods to archive and collect information on traditional medicinal practices and indigenous medicine,
More often than not we see that when the veda mahatthaya passes away, so does his knowledge. His children have either become doctors in Western medicine or moved on to other businesses. His Ola leaf scripts are buried in a temple or cupboard somewhere. No one is allowed to touch them, see them or study them, President Sirisena explained. The President also lamented the fact that such important information and knowledge was not being incorporated into modern technology and was being forgotten in the information age.
We must ask what our plan is to conserve and protect this knowledge, the President said.
The modern age has made us lose our uniqueness, traditional knowledge and made us eager to pursue anything foreign blindly, the President added.
This is why the Western doctor is treated differently to the Ayurvedic doctor and the village Veda Mahatthaya. We are not valuing and giving recognition to our own resources.
"We cannot pursue that of more developed countries without giving value and prominence to what is ours, the President said.

Emmerson Mnangagwa sworn in as Zimbabwe's president

Emmerson Mnangagwahas been sworn in as president of Zimbabwe, becoming the countrys second leader since independence from white minority rule in 1980.
Mnangagwa took his oath of office in front of tens of thousands of jubilant Zimbabweans who had gathered at a stadium in Harare, after greeting the crowd with a raised fist.
People sang and danced in the stands and raised banners reading Dawn of a new era and No to retribution, even as human rights activists began to report worrying details of attacks on close allies of the former first lady, Grace Mugabe, and their families.
Mnangagwa himself has warned against vengeful retribution.
Tendai Lesayo held a small Zimbabwean flag as she sold drinks from a cool box outside the stadium. She said she would welcome a fresh start, saying: Life now is impossible.
Elsewhere in the capital, long lines formed outside banks, a common sight in a country struggling with cash shortages and severe economic problems the new president will have to confront.
Right now, nothing has really changed for me. I still cannot get my money from the bank, said Amon Mutora, who had been waiting in line since 6am.
Mnangagwa is a 75-year-old stalwart of the ruling Zanu-PF party, widely known as the Crocodile  a liberation war nickname that may have stuck because it suited his reputation for ruthless cunning. He wassacked as vice-presidentby Robert Mugabe two weeks ago, trigging apolitical crisisthat culminated inMugabes resignationon Tuesday.
He will serve until the end of the presidential term next year. An election date has not yet been set.
Mnangagwa was a key Mugabe confidant for decades until they fell out because of the presidential ambitions of Grace Mugabe.
Critics have questioned his role in the Gukurahundi massacres in Matabeleland in 1983, when an estimated 20,000 people were killed in a crackdown on Mugabe opponents by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade. Mnangagwa has denied any part in the atrocities
Despite his long association with the government that has presided over Zimbabwes decline, including economic collapse and human rights abuses, Mnangagwa has promised democracy and reached out to other countries for help.
Mugabe was the worlds oldest head of state when he quit on Tuesday amid impeachment proceedings. In the end, he became isolated and showed few of the political skills that kept him in power for 37 years and made him a prominent but polarising figure on the world stage.
Mugabe did not attend Fridays swearing-in, but ruling party officials have said he will remain in Zimbabwe. Officials have promised he is safe and that his legacy as a war hero will stand after his fight for an independentZimbabwe.
Zimbabwes state-run Herald newspaper reported that Mnangagwa assured Mugabe and his family of their maximum security. The report said the two men agreed Mugabe would not attend on Friday because he needed time to rest. As the inauguration crowds passed by, Sharon Samuriwo sat watching from a ledge. She said she hoped Mnangagwa would learn from the errors of his predecessor, but acknowledged that the path ahead for Zimbabwe was unknown.
Still, after 37 years, weve got someone different, she said.

The Cuban Ambassador also brought forward the current diplomatic situation between the United States and Cuba, saying Even though we share a violent and suspicious past, the United States and Cuba must put aside their differences and view each other as equals and the USA must acknowledge Cubas sovereignty and duly respect the bilateral relationship that Cuba is offering.
After Fidel came into power he set up several policies that spelled a golden age for Cuba as he gave aid to the poor, introduced several popular educational reforms and is widely known for introducing a range of world-renowned medical reforms and policies that brought Cuba to the centre stage in the theatre that is the global community, the Cuban Ambassador said.

The JVP will bring a no confidence motion in Parliament against Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha for snatching away the voting right of the people by issuing a wrong gazette notification regarding the Local Government Elections, said JVP Publicity Secretary Vijitha Herath.
Addressing a Press Conference held at the JVP head office in Pelawatta yesterday, Herath said the gazette notification on the Local Government Elections was issued in February.The writ petition against the delimitation gazette was filed in November.
The question was why the writ petition was filed after nine months. The role of the appeal court and its limitations were known to Minister Faizer Mustapha.
Being a Presidents Council he should have observed the deficiencies in the gazette notification before issuing it. It did not happen due to a need for a conspiracy to postpone elections, alleged Vijitha Herath.
It was the Minister himself who knew the shortcomings in the gazette notification. The ordinary public were unaware of such shortcomings. As such we believe that the Minister himself would have given the necessary tips to the litigants who filed the writ petition.
Without filing the petition at the very outset they would have waited till the time arrives to announce the election to file it on the compulsion of the government itself, said Vijitha Herath.
This clearly proved an intention to postpone the election. As such, he is not fit to hold the post of Minister any more. Therefore, he should be removed from the post forthwith. But the President will not remove him because he is catering to the needs of the SLFP including the President. As such, we will bring a no confidence motion against him, said Vijitha Herath.

The invasion of Mahakanadarawa tank by Najas Marinas and Kambu which are Cyperus varieties has become a menace which is destroying the tank.
The Chairman of the Mahakanadarawa Reservoirs Integrated Farmers Organization R. M. R. Rajapaksha has complained to the Anuradhapura Government Agent, the Zonal Irrigation Director and the District Agriculture Committee to take immediate action to eradicate this menace since it would prevail to the adjoining small tanks and the canal systems coming under the Mahakanadarawa reservoir.
The Anuradhapura Zonal Irrigation Director Prasanna Silva referring to this issue at the recently held district agriculture committee meeting said that some irrigation labourers who were engaged in disposing of these aquatic plants in the tank were hospitalized as a result of some infectious skin diseases caused by the Najas Marinas.
It is not an easy task to get rid of this invasion since this particular plant is rooted deep in the water and appear in bulks. Raking it by using manpower is not sufficient as the invasion occurs so fast. I have already requested the Irrigation Department to give us two or three dredger machines to be used in removing these alien and poisonous aquatic plants without further delay, Prasanna Silva said.
In the meantime Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake has instructed the officials concerned to take immediate action to make the tank free of these unwanted aquatic weeds since Mahakanadarawa reservoir is the one and only water source being used to implement the JAICA funded Anuradhapura North Mega Water Supply scheme costing Rs. 60 million and also for the wellbeing of the reservoir.

MODI WANTS  JOINT VENTURES EXPEDITED
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi who held bilateral talks with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday informed the latter that India would like to have fast tracked the implementation of Indian joint ventures in Sri Lanka.
He added that this should be brought to the attention of President Maithripala Sirisena and these joint ventures started as soon as possible.
Prime Minister Modi explained that this would not only improve Sri Lankas economic assets but would also add to job creation.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka was ready to take all steps needed to fast track joint venture projects between the countries and that they were working on speedily resolving many of the current obstacles. Prime Minister Modi thus praised the Lankan Prime Ministers efforts in strengthening the bilateral relationship between the countries.
He noted that despite internal political opposition within Sri Lanka, Premier Wickremesinghe was taking great efforts in cementing the friendship between India and Sri Lanka.
The above statements were made when Prime Minister Wickremesinghe visited his Indian counterpart for talks at Hydrabad House, New Delhi, where the latter and his delegation were hosted to lunch.
In the meantime, Prime Minister Modi assured Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that as Sri Lanka celebrates 70 years of Independence, India would extend its complete support to the digital transformation of the education sector in the country.

The Indian PM pointed out that it was important to implement development programmes to fulfil the aspirations of the youth and thus the two Premiers discussed challenges in implementation of such plans.
The two sides exchanged ideas programmes to address food and energy security. They also focused on joint measures which need to be taken to ensure that the Indian Ocean was a region of peace and enable freedom of navigation.
Modi who touched on the warm welcome he received during his last visit to Sri Lanka highlighted the importance of improving people to people relations between the two countries.

Net Neutrality gives voice to the people: PM

Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday came out in support of Net Neutrality, saying that unthrottled access to the Internet is key to level playing field and giving voice of the oppressed.
Speaking at the Global Conference on Cyber Space in India he said that there is a need for ensuring Net Neutrality, a principle that has come under serious challenge in many parts of the world including in US.
"Net Neutrality is the basic principle that prohibits Internet service providers from speeding up, slowing down or blocking any content online," he said. "It has been the guiding principle involved in the way Internet has always worked."
Net Neutrality is the right of users to go where they want and do what they want on the Internet without the broadband provider getting in the way.
It means a broadband provider can't block websites, throttle services or charge premiums if certain online content in reached.
Wickremesinghe said: "Net Neutrality lowers the barriers of entry by preserving the Internet as a fair and level playing field and helps businesses and entrepreneurs to thrive.
"Similarly the open Internet facilitated by Net Neutrality allows marginalised and oppressed segments that are not adequately represented in mainstream media to tell their stories and get mobilised for justice as we have seen in recent times."
The Sri Lankan Prime Minister's comments come at a time when there is a raging debate over Net Neutrality globally.
US regulator Federal Communications Commission has said recently that it plans to roll back the "Net Neutrality" rules adopted in 2015.
Wickremesinghe further said that the opposition parties in Sri Lanka faced blockage of ISPs but when his party came to power, the freedom to use the Internet was ensured.
"India the world's largest democracy with the second most populous Internet user base took a critical step in this direction when it issued regulations in February 2016, when it banned zero rating," he said.
Cyberspace has become repository of information and knowledge, he said, adding that contrary to traditional thinking the use of open data does not compromise the idea of security.
Stating that open source data can contribute in gathering more accurate information, he cited the example of 2011 when a super computer was able to pinpoint location of Osama bin Laden.
Open source data analysis, he said, can be more effective than collecting and using data in a clandestine manner without a very specified target infringing on liberty and individual freedom.

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said disciplinary action against Joint Opposition MPs who made threatening comments to bomb Parliament will be decided at the Privileges Committee and moved in Parliament as a resolution.
The Speaker made this observation when Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera questioned in Parliament yesterday on the delay in taking disciplinary action against MPs Wimal Weerawansa, Keheliya Rambukwella and Jayantha Samaraweera who spoke of bombing Parliament.
He requested the Speaker not to take the threatening comments of MP Weerawansa lightly given his motivations and his family connection to the previous incident of the grenade attack in Parliament in 1987.
MP Weerawansa threatened to drop bombs on Parliament by air if the draft Constitution received the two thirds majority . MP Samaraweera had condoned this statement while MP Rambukwella had said that not only one but Parliament must be attacked with 100 bombs. We brought this matter to the attention of the Speaker earlier too, but are yet to see any disciplinary action against them, he said.

Sri Lanka won their second toss of the series and decided to bat on what both captains reckoned was a good pitch for Test cricket, with a little bit of assistance expected for the quicks early before the spinners take over in the second innings.
Sri Lanka didn't make any changes to their XI, which meant the unimpressive Lahiru Gamage got another game and the impressive Dasun Shanaka was entrusted with the role of the fifth bowler and lower-order batsman.
India made three changes to their XI, two that could have been predicted and one forced on them. Mohammed Shami sat out with a hip niggle, making way for Ishant Sharma. M Vijay expectedly replaced Shikhar Dhawan, who is away for personal reasons.
Rohit Sharma finally got some game time because India realised they could need him in South Africa; he came in for Bhuvneshwar Kumar, meaning India went in with four bowlers.

World focus on traditional medicine,industry growing - Minister
Sri Lanka which boasts of a 30,000 strong traditional medicine community will prepare to cater to a fast growing herbal medicine industry, expected to touch USD 110 billion in 2018, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister, Dr.Rajitha Senaratne said.
The Minister addressing the three day International Symposium on Traditional and Complimentary Medicine (Tradmed) at Waters Edge, Battaramulla explained that the traditional medicine industry which had more practitioners than western medicine had over 40 percent of them academically and institutionally qualified. The symposium which had 120 research papers and 100 research posters provides a good platform for the exchange and development of research in the field.
Traditional and indigenous practices are well accepted and compliment western medicine in this country. By integrating the two into our national health system we have further strengthened it, Minister Senaratne said.
The Minister further stated that he appreciated the WHO stand to recognise alternative medicine as a viable source of cure for diseases, They have realized that western medicine cannot answer all questions and there are blank areas which have been filled by alternative medicine.
The symposium which was jointly organized by the Ministry, University of Sri Jayawardenapura and the WHO had WHO South East Asia Regional Director, Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh admit that traditional medicine had flourished well in Sri Lanka despite the presence of western medicine,
In Asia, 80 percent in rural areas use some form of traditional medicine, at times it is their only source of healthcare, she said, noting that many also used it to complement modern health practices, especially managing lifestyle related chronic conditions.
Dr Singh also commended the government for being the only country to combine both kinds of systems of medicine under one ministry. Traditional medicine is a natural ally in our pursuit of universal coverage and the WHO supports the drive to fully integrate traditional medicine into healthcare systems, she added.
Since 1997, the WHO has recognized the importance of traditional medicine and supported countries to develop their own traditional medicinal systems and use it in their health care systems, explained Dr Singh.
In 2014, the World Health Assembly adopted the Traditional Medicine Strategy to achieve two outcomes; fully harness traditional medicine benefits for people centred universal healthcare and to ensure traditional medicine is safe to use through regulation and research.
In October 2015, the WHO agreed on a five year action plan to; improve monitoring of traditional systems of medicine, increasing research in new developments in traditional medicine and encourage quality and safety by sharing best practices in national adverse reporting systems for traditional and modern medicine.
This also led to the development of indicators for monitoring traditional medicine systems,Dr Singh said.

Zimbabwe: Emmerson Mnangagwa to succeed Mugabe as President

Emmerson Mnangagwa is to be sworn in as Zimbabwe's President, following the dramatic departure of Robert Mugabe after 37 years of authoritarian rule.
The former Vice-President - who returned from exile on Wednesday - will be inaugurated at Harare's stadium.
His dismissal this month led the ruling Zanu-PF party and the army to intervene and force Mugabe to quit.
The opposition is urging Mnangagwa, who has been part of the ruling elite, to end the "culture of corruption".
The news on Tuesday that 93-year-old Mugabe was stepping down sparked wild celebrations across the country.
It came in the form of a letter read out in Parliament, abruptly halting impeachment proceedings against him.
In it, Mugabe said he was resigning to allow a smooth and peaceful transfer of power, and that his decision was voluntary.
Neither Mugabe nor his wife Grace have been seen in public since Sunday, and their whereabouts are unknown.
On Thursday, several reports suggested Mugabe had been granted immunity from prosecution.
State TV said he would attend the inauguration.
The ceremony will be at the 60,000-capacity National Sports Stadium in the capital, with organisers calling on Zimbabweans to come and witness a "historic day".
Ahead of the swearing-in, Mnangagwa urged Zimbabweans to "remain patient and peaceful and desist from any form of vengeful retribution".
He fled to South Africa two weeks ago - only to return home on Wednesday's to a hero's welcome.
Mnangagwa pledged to create jobs in a country where some estimates say 90% of people are unemployed.
"We want to grow our economy, we want peace, we want jobs, jobs, jobs," he told cheering crowds in Harare.
Zimbabwe's main industrial index has slumped by 40% since last week's military intervention. The stock market has shed $6bn (4.5bn) in a week.
Analysts say the market is now correcting itself, optimistic of a change of economic policy under Mnangagwa.
However,the International Monetary Fund has warned that Zimbabwe must act quickly to dig its economy out of a holeand access international financial aid.
On Thursday, Zimbabwe's main opposition MDC party called for deep-rooted political reform to dismantle the repressive apparatus that sustained Mugabe's regime.
"As MDC, we are saying, after so many years of Zanu-PF misrule, the first thing that needs to be transformed is the culture. The culture of violence, the culture of corruption. We need to change that culture," MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai said.
"And for President Mnangagwa, he must realise that it is not an easy walk in the park."
It is unclear whether Zanu-PF will govern alone ahead of scheduled elections next year, or whether a coalition government of national unity that includes opposition groups will be formed.
