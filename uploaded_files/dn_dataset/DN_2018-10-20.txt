Pakistans Azhar Ali thought ball had gone for four.....:
The greatest run-out of all time!
Pakistan star Azhar Ali was run-out in comical fashion on day three of the second Test against Australia at Abu Dhabi after assuming the ball had gone for four.
In a series of events more reminiscent of club than Test cricket, Ali was left to rue his failure to remember the basics, a mistake described by Michael Vaughan as 'the greatest run-out of all time'.
The No 3 edged a ball from Peter Siddle wide of gully and with the third man area vacant presumed the ball had run away for four.
But it stopped dead inches from the boundary rope with the Australian fielders quick to notice the mishap in the middle.
Ali had not even bothered running, only glancing at where the ball had gone before taking a few steps down the track and consulting his batting partner Asad Shafiq.
Shafiq had his eyes on the ball, but he too did not notice it fall short.
The pair punched gloves and paused for a mid-pitch chat as Mitchell Starc's bullet throw from the boundary rope was received by wicketkeeper Tim Paine, who gleefully removed the bails.
Ali stared in disbelief as he was caught well out of his crease with the Australians celebrating wildly.
He reluctantly trudged back to the pavilion at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, with his 141-ball vigil coming to a farcical end.
Ali hit 64 as Pakistan built a substantial lead over Australia in their second innings.
His wicket left the hosts 160 for four, 297 runs ahead of the Aussies.
Azhar Ali explains the bizarre Run Out
Pakistan batsmen Azhar Ali and Asad Shafiq were involved in a bizarre run out on Day 3 of the second Test against Australia in Abu Dhabi. Cricketers and fans alike were shocked after witnessing the comical run out. Azhar, in the post match press conference, explained what happened in the middle after he edged a Peter Siddle delivery towards the third-man region.
We were just discussing that the ball was swinging a bit late. We both didnt actually realise something like this could happen. When Mitchell Starc threw the ball even then we didnt think anything was happening but when it landed in the gloves of the keeper we realised something funny was happening, Azhar explained.
The way the shot was hit to a fast bowler and the edge flew I thought it reached the boundary. But there is no excuse. Everyone was pulling our legs in the dressing room but at that moment it was a shock,Azhar recalled.
We were not watching the ball and that was the reason I missed the whole sight of it. I wasnt happy with it and thankfully other batsmen did the job and we laughed about it afterwards. It is kind of disappointing and a shock but also funny, Azhar further explained.
My son is going to speak about it (the run out) for a long time and in a funny way, said Azhar of his 10-year-old son Ibtisam, who arrived at the ground after his fathers dismissal.
Whenever I will say something about cricket he will surely come back to this incident, Azhar said.
OTHER BIZARRE RUN-OUTS
IAN BELL:
Azhar's misfortune was reminiscent of Ian Bell's blunder against India at Trent Bridge seven years ago. The England batsman had crafted a typically stylish century and was heading towards the pavilion after believing Eoin Morgan had hit a four from the final delivery before tea.
However, Praveen Kumar had actually prevented the boundary, perhaps even unbeknown to him, and his casual throw was followed by Mahendra Singh Dhoni removing the bails. After a couple of minutes of confusion,
Bell was given out to his and the crowd's astonishment. He was ultimately reinstated following talks between the England and India camps but later admitted he had been "very naive (and) a bit stupid."
MISBAH-UL-HAQ:
Featuring in just his eighth Test against Pakistan's bitter rivals India in 2007, Misbah looked on course for his maiden international ton but his relative inexperience came back to haunt him.
Jogging through for a single, the genial batsman who would go on to become known for his unflappable temperament was on course to make his ground but jumped up at precisely the wrong moment to avoid Dinesh Karthik's throw, creating a passage for the ball to thud into the stumps and dismissing Misbah for 82.
Misbah would show his resolve over the course of the series with hundreds in the following two Tests.
AMIT MISHRA:
The Sunrisers Hyderabad leg-spinner was given ample opportunity to make his ground during a 2014 Indian Premier League group game against the Rajasthan Royals, but comically failed on all counts.
In the final over of the Sunrisers' innings, Mishra was unable to connect with James Faulkner's slower ball but set off for a bye. As he was halfway down the pitch, Sanju Samson's shy missed the stumps while Faulkner was then wayward with his throw with Mishra in no man's land.
Not satisfied with two lives, the tail-ender idled his way back towards the crease but was still inches short and looking at non-striker Irfan Pathan when Samson finally threw down the stumps.
PETER NEVILL:
Of the batsmen who have featured on this list, Nevill is perhaps the only one who escapes any blame. Dwayne Bravo was taking centre stage in a Melbourne derby in the 2015-16 Big Bash League, and looked to heave Stars leg-spinner Adam Zampa down the ground.
The Renegades batsman connected with a full toss that first ricocheted off non-striker Nevill's bat before pin-balling off Zampa's face and on to the stumps.
Nevill's immediate concern was not that he had been run-out while backing up but for the bowler, who received immediate treatment but ultimately escaped injury for his inadvertent heroics.

Use of medicines up 600 per cent after price reduction
The use of medicines has gone up 600 per cent compared with the time prior to introducing the drug prices reduction, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing a press conference held in the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday.
The Minister said that in the past poor people did not take prescribed drugs because they could not afford them. Now they daily take drugs as per the medical advice since the prices of drugs gone down.
Minister Senaratne said that in developed countries four or five brands of one drug are available. Sri Lanka has about 30 or 40 brands of the same drug. Some are of very low quality. Rs. 4.4 billion was saved after reducing the drug prices. Still drug companies earn a huge profit, the Minister said.
National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Chairman Prof. Asitha De Silva said the drug prices were reduced as per the WHO rules, regulations and recommendations.
No drug company has officially informed the NMRA that they will leave the Sri Lankan drug market. No doctor or any association of doctors has complained about a possible shortage of high quality drugs. The drug market is between US $ 850 and 950 and the drug price reduction has given relief for people who use drugs for lifetime to control Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs). The market of certain drugs has gone up by 236 per cent. Rs. 4.5 billion was saved from cancer drugs. The NMRA has registered high quality drugs used in Australia and Europe, he said..
State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) Chairman Dr. Sayuru Samarasundara said the SPMC earns a huge profit even after selling drugs for very low prices. The high prices of glucometers were regulated from September 1 after considering many things. A bonus of Rs. 2,500 is given to a pharmacy when it sold five glucometers, he said..
Consultant Pediatrician and Clinical Head of the Centre for Clinical Management of Dengue and Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever, Negombo, Dr. Lakkumara Fernando said the media campaign against the reduction of drug prices has hidden agendas. In the past, high quality drugs could not be prescribed because of the high prices. Now high quality drugs are prescribed since anybody can afford them. Reducing drug prices has given a huge relief for the doctors who treat patients with quality drugs, he said.
Consultant Physician, Infectious Diseases Hospital and Dengue Specialist Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama said certain brands of drugs left the drug market long before the introduction of drug price reduction.
Surgeon Nissanka Jayawardana, the Pharmaceutical Traders Association Head Kapila de Zoysa and few others spoke.

Abdul Qadir's son gets Australia PM XI nod
SYDNEY, Friday - Usman Qadir, the son of Pakistan spin-bowling great Abdul, was named in a Prime Ministers XI to face South Africa on Friday, inching a little closer to his goal of one day representing Australia.
The 25-year-old, a leg-spinner like his father, moved to Australia to play for in 2016 and is hoping to become a citizen in 2020 and represent his adopted nation in the Twenty20 World Cup later that same year.
The Prime Ministers XI is traditionally a mix of promising youngsters with experienced internationals whose time in the Australia side has come to an end and the side named to play South Africa in Canberra on Oct. 31 was no exception.
Captained by former Australia Twenty20 skipper George Bailey and with former test opener Chris Rogers at the top of batting order, the team also includes sprinkling of fringe national team and Australia A representatives.
Qadir earned his spot on the back of a promising start to his time in state competition with Western Australia, taking 3-50 on debut against Victoria in a one-dayer last month. His fellow Pakistan-born leg-spinner Fawad Ahmed played three ODIs and two T20s for Australia after claiming asylum in the country in 2010, while current test opener Usman Khawaja was born in Islamabad before emigrating to Australia as a child.

Charges against Nizamdeen dropped, threatens to sue Police
Australian Police have decided to drop terrorism charges against Mohamed Kamer Nizamdeen, (25), a Sri Lankan studying at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, after having accused him of plotting to assassinate Australian politicians, reports the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).
Nizamdeens lawyer has threatened to take legal action against the police.
He was arrested in August and accused of writing in a notebook about plans to kill former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his former deputy Julie Bishop.
Thereafter, prosecutors conceded a handwriting expert could not prove he had written the notes in the notebook.
Australian Police yesterday dropped the charge of collecting or making documents likely to facilitate terrorist acts after definitive advice on the handwriting in the notebook was received on Thursday.
ABC further reports: Speaking outside court on Friday,Nizamdeens lawyer Moustafa Kheir said the process had taken a toll on the student, who spent a month in a maximum-security prison after being charged.
Hes gone through super max jail  unforgivable circumstances.
Police had alleged Nizamdeen possessed a blueprint to target several symbolic Sydney locations, after officers from NSWs Joint Counter-Terrorism Team (JCTT) arrested him at Kensington in Sydneys south-east in August.
Police had alleged the blueprints were found in a notebook in a desk that Nizamdeen used at the University of New South Wales.
His arrest and time in jail sparked protests in his Sri Lankan hometown as well as concerns from classmates at The University of New South Wales. Kheir said Nizamdeen would be suing the police for compensation.
We are seeking justice through every avenue we can, he said.
Speaking on Friday, NSW Police Counter-Terrorism Assistant Commissioner Michael Willing declined to comment on the legal threat, calling it a matter for Nizamdeens lawyers and family.
He also declined to apologise to the family.
The investigation is ongoing, he said.
Were relying on forensic analysis of material.
We are looking at of whole raft of lines of inquiry at the moment, and these things take time.
Speaking after questions on Nizamdeens month-long stint in jail,the Assistant Commissioner Willing said the very nature of terrorism threats meant his department often had to act first.
There were serious threats, he said.
[And] we can never be complacent because the terrorist threat in Australia and New South Wales is very, very real.
In a statement, police said the investigation had shifted to focus on the possibility that the content of the notebook has been created by other people.
The JCTT acted in good faith on the evidence available at all stages of the investigation, the statement said.
The investigation into the circumstances of this matter remains ongoing, but there is no information to indicate that there is a current threat to community safety.

China to launch 'artificial moon' by 2020
CHINA: China is planning to launch its own 'artificial moon' by 2020 to replace streetlamps and lower electricity costs in urban areas, state media reported Friday.
Chengdu, a city in southwestern Sichuan province, is developing illumination satellites which will shine in tandem with the real moon, but are eight times brighter, according to China Daily.
The first man-made moon will launch from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan, with three more to follow in 2022 if the first test goes well, said Wu Chunfeng, head of Tian Fu New Area Science Society, the organization responsible for the project.
Though the first launch will be experimental, the 2022 satellites will be the real deal with great civic and commercial potential, he said in an interview with China Daily.
By reflecting light from the sun, the satellites could replace streetlamps in urban areas, saving an estimated 1.2 billion yuan ($170 million) a year in electricity costs for Chengdu, if the man-made moons illuminate an area of 50 square kilometers.
The extraterrestrial source of light could also help rescue efforts in disaster zones during blackouts, he added.
AFP was not able to contact Wu nor the Tian Fu New Area Science Society to confirm the reports.
As China's space programme races to catch up with that of the United States and Russia, a number of ambitious projects are in the pipeline, including the Chang'e-4 lunar probe -- named after the moon goddess in Chinese mythology -- which aims to launch later this year. If it succeeds, it will be the first rover to explore the dark side of the moon.
China is not the first country to try beaming sunlight back to Earth. In the 1990s, Russian scientists reportedly used giant mirrors to reflect light from space in an experimental project called Znamya or Banner.

Sinister plan to attack young politicians
Dubious Italian instigator making malicious  charges against me - State Minister
State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe said he made a fresh complaint on Thursday (18) at Police headquarters against the instigator who levelled bribery allegations against him recently. Senasinghe said the same person also happened to have made a death threat against about an year ago.
It was also revealed that the same person has also made a death threat against Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara during the same period.
Senasinghe also said that he is requesting the Financial Crimes Investigation Division, the Criminal Investigations Department and the IGP to inquire into these malicious charges levelled against him. Senasinghe said he hopes to propose reinstating the law of criminal defamation back, in Parliament soon.
Minister Harin Fernando said they will request Interpol to launch an investigation into the instigator Anton Deshapriya, who is in Italy. Fernando said they will write to the Italian Embassy in Sri Lanka to inquire into the said person and also requested the Foreign Ministry to take action against him through Interpol.
At a press brief held at Sirikotha, UNP Headquarters yesterday, the two ministers together with Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara Jayamaha and UNP backbencher MP Heshan Vithana vehemently denied the allegation that State Minister Senasinghe had requested bribes from an investor for the project.
State Minister Senasinghe speaking said the person had aimed malicious charges against him, pointed out that the instigator and his family had fled the country due to heavy indebtedness. This Anton Deshapriya, his mother and his wife are all scammers.They all have taken loans from Peoples Bank and the Bank of Ceylon and havent paid them. This is public money, we are talking about. How can such scammers level bribery allegations against me This very same person contacted me over the phone about a year ago and threatened me with life. He spoke in a very abusive manner. I even made a complaint at the Mirihana police in reference to this phone call I received. Now this very same person comes and alleges that I asked for a bribe to bring in Rs. 800 bn worth investment into the country. How can a person like this bring in such a gigantic investment If this man can bring in 1% of the Rs. 800 bn investment that he was speaking about, I will resign and go home, Senasinghe said.
Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara, on the same note, said that the allegations against State Minister Senasinghe are the doings of a well-organized gang who wants to defame the government. He also said that nobody can affect the government by spreading creative allegations as these.
Minister Harin Fernando said that it is suspicious that the allegations surface in a time when a Joint Opposition MP had travelled to Italy. Initially we didnt want to make a fuss about these allegations because we didnt want to make these persons well-known characters in the country. But there comes a point where we have to defend ourselves. By the end of this month, all the three special high courts will be up and running. The persons who are frightened by these developments are trying to unstable the government. Minister Fernando pointed out. MP Heshan Vithanage said there is a well-designed agenda to defame young UNP politicians who were a major part of toppling the previous regime. This is a project that targets young politicians like Senasinghe, Fernando and Bandara who contributed to change the former regime.These politicians come from well to do business families. They dont want to earn money using politics. The Rajapaksa-gang is frightened by the new Special High Courts. They even criticise their own MPs like Kumara Welgama for speaking the truth, MP Heshan Vithana said.

Five matches in which two batsmen scored double centuries in the same innings
The most challenging thing for a cricketer is to change their game according to the format. The type of play that is required in ODIs is very different from what is demanded by Tests. Players need to have a lot of character and temperament when playing Test cricket and need to play the game with highest level of concentration, and there is no margin of error.
The highly respected Test format requires batsmen to vex the bowlers with defensive technique and only go for strokes when bad deliveries come at them. It requires not just skill but the right mindset to score daddy hundreds in the longer format.
Through the course of this article, we look at five matches in which two batsmen scored double centuries in the same innings.
5. MAHELA JAYAWARDENE (240) AND THILAN SAMARAWEERA (231)
Mahela Jayawardene is one of the greatest batsmen of all-time. He has always been reliable for Sri Lanka with his consistent performances. Thilan Samaraweera did not enjoy great success in the shorter format. However, in the longer format, he played a key-role in the middle-order and saved the team on numerous occasions.
Sri Lanka toured Pakistan for a 2-Test series. In the first test at Karachi, the visitors won the toss and chose to bat first. Jayawardene and Samaraweera came up big and stitched a 437-run partnership for the 4th wicket. The Pakistani bowlers were left scratching their heads as the two took the attack to the opposition with a beautiful partnership.
Jayawardene scored 240 off 424 balls with 32 fours. Samaraweera scored 231 off 318 balls 31 fours. This was his first double-century in Test cricket. The visitors posted a mammoth total of 644 in the first innings. However, Younis Khan answered back for Pakistan with a triple-century of his own, and Pakistan racked up 765 in their first innings. The match eventually ended in a draw.
Samaraweera then posted another double-century in the very next game at Lahore. However, the match was abandoned after a terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team bus.
4. RICKY PONTING (221) AND MICHAEL CLARKE (210)
Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke are names that need no introduction. They were both successful captains and the Australian team played fearless cricket under their captaincy, demolishing even the best of the teams.
India visited Australia for a 4-Test series in 2012. The hosts humiliated the visitors and clinched the series 3-0 after the first three Tests. The final Test in Adelaide was just dead rubber. Ponting and Clarke, who had been brilliant throughout the series, continued their dominance and decimated the Indian bowlers.
After losing 3 early wickets for just 84 runs, Clarke and Ponting added 386 runs for the fourth wicket before the former was dismissed by Umesh Yadav. Clarke scored 210 off just 275 balls and Ponting scored 221 off 404 balls. They combined for 47 boundaries and a solitary six.
The hosts defeated the visitors and finished the series 4-0. Michael Clarke was the Man of the Series for scoring 626 runs in 6 innings at an average of 125.20. Ricky Ponting also had a great series as he amassed 544 runs in 6 innings at an average of 108.80.
3. GAUTAM GAMBHIR (206) AND VVS LAXMAN (200*)
Gautam Gambhir and VVS Laxman are two of the greatest Test batsmen India have had. Gambhir provided terrific starts at the top of the order and set the platform. VVS Laxman was known for his match-saving ability batting with the tail-enders, and led India to famous victories.
The Aussies toured India for a 4-Test series in 2008. After the first Test ended in a draw, India defeated the visitors by a huge margin in the second Test and went up 1-0 in the series. The focus shifted to the third Test at Feroz Shah Kotla.
Batting first, India lost two quick wickets in the form of Sehwag and Dravid, but Sachin managed to provide the team some respite, scoring 68 runs. After Sachins wicket, Laxman took over and the Gambhir-Laxman duo exploded for a 278-run partnership for the 4th wicket before the former got dismissed for 206. Laxman carried on and scored an unbeaten 200, his second double-century and the home team declared at 613-7.
The match was drawn and India held on to the 1-0 lead in the series. VVS Laxman, who scored an unbeaten double-century in the first innings and an unbeaten half-century in the second innings, was rightly adjudged the Man of the Match.
2. GRAEME SMITH (232) AND NEIL MCKENZIE (226)
Graeme Smith is arguably the greatest Test skipper of all-time. He holds the record for most Tests as captain and the Proteas had great success during his stint. Neil McKenzie featured in 58 Tests and scored 3253 runs at an average of 37.39. He gave good starts to the team on a number of occasions and blunted the new ball.
South Africa were up against Bangladesh for a 2-Test series in 2008. After winning the first Test in an emphatic fashion, the visitors were looking to win the second and the final Test and go home with the cup. South Africa won the toss and chose to bat first.
Neil McKenzie and Graeme Smith combined for a record-breaking partnership of 415 runs for the first wicket. They destroyed the bowlers for runs all around the park and played at a really good pace. Neil McKenzie was dismissed for 226 runs off 388 balls. This included 28 fours and 3 sixes.
This was his first (and only) double century in Test cricket. The skipper scored 232 off 277 balls with 33 fours and a six. They went past the previous record of 413 runs set by Vinoo Mankad and Pankaj Roy.
The visitors won this game and also the series 2-0. Graeme Smith was awarded the Man of the Match for his double-century that came at a strike rate of 83.75.
1. MAHELA JAYAWARDENE (374) AND KUMAR SANGAKKARA (287)
Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara were the mainstays of the Sri Lankan batting lineup for over a decade and came up alive every game to help the team win games. The two left their mark on the game of cricket and will forever be remembered as legends. After their retirements, the team has been struggling to find replacements, and are on a spree of heart-breaking losses. Sri Lanka hosted South Africa for a 2-Test series in 2006. In the first Test at Colombo, the visitors batted first, but were bundled out for a paltry 169. Dilhara Fernando and Muttiah Muralitharan ripped the heart out of South African side with combined figures of 31.2-8-89-8.
In return, Steyn struck early, picking up two wickets, and the hosts were reduced to 14-2. Then Jayawardene and Sangakkara piled on a record partnership. The two stitched 624 runs for the third wicket and decimated the visitors. The partnership was eventually broken when Sangakkara fell to Hall after scoring 287 runs off 457 balls with 35 fours. Jayawardene finished the innings with 374 off 572 balls, accompanied by 43 fours and a solitary six.
The hosts went on to win the game and go up 1-0 in the series. The skipper was awarded Man of the Match for his brilliant triple-century. - sportsk

I should have done better, says Vettel
AUSTIN, Texas, Thursday - Sebastian Vettel recognised on Thursday that he and Ferrari had made mistakes this season but refused to single out the moment where his hopes of winning a fifth Formula One title ended.
The German is 67 points behind Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton, who can instead become a five-time champion in Texas on Sunday.
The Briton has won six of the last seven races, and is chasing a fifth in a row.
Asked at the U.S. Grand Prix whether he accepted Mercedes had done a better job than Ferrari, Vettel was clear: So far, yes. Its pretty obvious. You just have to look at the points.
I should have done better. If you want to name one (race), then Hockenheim, he added.
Maybe we should have done better, but overall we just didnt have enough races where we had the speed to dominate the weekend and put the car on pole and finish first.
Vettel, winner of five races so far this year, led at his home German Grand Prix at Hockenheim before skidding off a wet track and into the barriers. Hamilton went on to win.
The Germans first retirement of the year cost him the championship lead at a crucial point but he questioned the significance of it.
I am not a believer in this has been the turning point or the stars have been wrongly aligned and all this. I dont believe it, he said.
Hamilton will be champion if he scores eight points more than Vettel, something he has done for the past four races with Mercedes now chasing a hat-trick of one-two finishes.
I dont think its much point now to start thinking too much about what happened, said Vettel on the situation.
I think its still something that we have in our hands to change and thats what we look for.
Asked what his approach would be to the weekend, which promises to be wet and cold, Vettel said it was simple.
We are quite some points behind, we focus on winning and then we see what the others are doing, so its quite straightforward to be honest, he said.
Generally I always try to win so I think you have to be aggressive to win. And of course you need to find the right balance so obviously you never try to do something silly or not to finish because that way you cant win, he said.
I know what it takes, I know what to do...but for sure we know we need to take probably here or there a bit more risk because we are not in the position to manage the gap in the championship, because we dont have a gap.
Vettel said the previous race in Japan had helped Ferrari understand more about their car and hoped Austin could see a return to form.
Hamilton has won five of the six races held at the Circuit of the Americas, with Vettel the only other driver to triumph there  with Red Bull in 2013.

The Ingiriya Sathosa has been closed over a month after it was shifted to a new place.
The Sathosa outlet was shifted to a new place almost a one month ago and the customers are deprived of its service because it is close since then.
Reportedly, the monthly rental of the new place is Rs. 120,000 and the electricity bill is around Rs. 100,000. The Sathosa branch has five employees and all these together, the loss is huge.
The opening of the Sathosa branch is delayed because of its so far incomplete name board.

Its entirely my fault Don Bradman didnt average 100 in Tests: Neil Harvey
The story of how Don Bradman fell four runs short of ending his Test career with a surreal average of 100 is the stuff of legend. Eric Hollies, the England spinner, bowled Bradman for a duck in what was to be his final Test innings.
England had been skitted for 52 in their first innings of the fifth and final Test and Australia replied with 389. With England being bowled out for 189 in their second dig, the visitors won by an innings and 149 runs.
However, another Australia legend Neil Harvey feels he was equally guilty of denying Don the magical landmark. In the fourth Test of the tour, at Leeds, with Australia needing four to win, Harvey came in to bat at No. 4 after the dismissal of Keith Miller. Batting alongside him was Bradman, unbeaten on 173.
Harvey smacked the first ball-faced for a four to seal the deal. At that time, nobody was aware of the fact that Bradman was four runs shy of averaging 100 in Test cricket.
70 years after that famous incident, Harvey is still living with the regret. That four at Leeds makes me feel very guilty, Harvey was quoted as saying by Stuff.co.nz on Sunday. Its entirely my fault Bradman didnt average 100 in Test cricket. If he had scored those four runs instead of me, hed have got there.
Statistics dominate every conversations in cricket today. However, back in those days, they were rarely mentioned and Harvey says despite nobody being aware of the incredible feat Bradman was so close to achieve at that time, hes ready to take the blame.
I went in and Ken Cranston, a seam bowler from Lancashire, bowled this thing on my leg stump and I whacked it through mid-wicket for four, Harvey said. The public charged onto the ground and I can still remember Bradman yelling, come on son, lets get out of here.
Im quite willing to take the blame. But I didnt know he was going to get a duck in his last Test match  Nobody knew Bradman needed four runs at Leeds; nobody knew he needed four runs when he played in his last Test at the Oval.
The duck meant Bradman finished with 6996 runs from 52 Tests and average of 99.94 with 29 centuries and 13 fifties. Statistics were never mentioned back then; there was no television and no one in the press seemed to know. When the poor bloke was bowled that was it.
He wasnt going to get another chance because we dismissed England for 52 in their first innings, the 89-year-old said.

Lalith and Anushas appeals against conviction fixed for inquiry
Two Appeal petitions filed by former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita challenging the judgement of the Colombo High Court were yesterday fixed for argument on November 26 by the Court of Appeal.
Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita had been sentenced to three-years-Rigorous Imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs.600 million of funds belonging to TRC. When the two appeal petitions came up before Court of Appeal Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Justice Achala Wengappuli, the parties were directed to file their written submissions.
On September 7 2017, Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita were found guilty of misappropriating Rs.600 million of funds belonging to TRC over Controversial Sil Redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sill) distribution case.
Through their appeal applications, two accused-appellants stated that they were seeking the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to review and set aside their conviction imposed by the High Court dated September 7, 2017.
In their petitions, the accused-appellants stated that neither a sum of Rs.600 million nor a part of it were utilised by them for their personal gains.
They further stated that the High Court judge had given them a short period of time (13 days) to pay off the compensations.
While handing out a lengthy judgment, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga had maintained that the prosecutors have proven the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
The High Court Judge further maintained that the accused had committed this offence dishonestly with the intention of gaining undue advantage to a particular candidate during the 2015-Presidential Election.l
While observing a political motivation had led the accused to commit this offence, Lalith Weeratunge and Anusha Palpita were ordered to pay a compensation of Rs.50 million each to the TRC in lieu of losses incurred contrary to the Telecommunication Act.

Lankans life expectancy will increase in next few years - Rajitha
The life expectancy of Sri Lankans will significantly increase in the next few years as a result of reducing drug prices and providing free eye lenses and heart stents, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday.
He said a female journalist of an English newspaper had written fabricated and inaccurate facts on reduced drug prices to mislead people on behalf of two drug companies that lost their small market here.
Minister Senaratne said that no drug company has informed that they would leave Sri Lankan market against the drug price reduction and there will be no high quality drug shortage in Sri Lanka as predicted by certain newspapers.
Even though those two companies left Sri Lanka, it would not impact us because the drug brands being sold by them do not have a market in Sri Lanka, the Minister said. Only 180 capsules of their drugs are sold in Sri Lanka, the Minister said.
The Minister said these two companies may leave the country because they do not have a market here.
This English newspaper promoted tobacco companies and misled the public when the 90 per cent tax was imposed on tobacco. Now this newspaper does the same for money on behalf of drug companies.
Especially, one drug company behind this campaign owns a private hospital. It opposes the upcoming price reduction of private hospital charges. The high charges of private hospitals will be regulated soon, the Minister said.
The Minister said these companies held a meeting in a five-star hotel recently to prevent importers from bringing in insulin to Sri Lanka and create an artificial shortage but the rest opposed their move, the Minister said.

For law to thrive, Business must thrive - Kiriella
Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella spoke about the interdependence of law and business during the launch of Law and Management Journal, vol. II, at the Galadari Hotel on Thursday.
We have enough laws in the country, Kiriella said, but most of the lawyers who pass out of law today do not have much work. He suggested that the evolution of business and law coincide, Our business environment has been virtually static, and as a result, the legal systems havent developed as much as we expected, he said.
To break away from the beaten track, business must thrive, Kiriella said, if there is hope in that field, then only law will thrive.
Kiriella said that at the time of independence Sri Lanka had been an economy comparable to Japans, but has since fallen miles behind the economies of Japan, Singapore, and Malaysia.
He attributed much of this economic lag to the inefficiency of State institutions. Now in Sri Lanka today the biggest problem is the State spends nearly 450 billion rupees to subsidise state institutions. Kiriella said. He said the ability of those institutions to be self-sufficient, supporting their own expenditure, thats a starting point.
The Law and Management Journal is published by the Institute of Legal and Management Studies (ILMS). Speakers at the event noted of the paucity of law and business academic resources, and the importance of this journal. We have very little legal literature in Sri Lanka, Chairman of ILMS, Sunil Abeyaratne said, and when it comes to legal management literature, we basically only have these two magazines.
The launch was attended by Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya, and present and former members of Parliament.

Controversial Siriliya Saviya Defender in custody:
Magistrate directs Govt. Analyst to provide report
The Colombo Chief Magistrates Court yesterday, issued an order directing the Government Analyst to provide an analytical report pertaining to the Defender vehicle that was given to Shiranthi Rajapaksa to carry out activities relating to the Siriliya Saviya Foundation.
Colombo Additional Magistrate Isuru Nettikumara made this order in order to ascertain whether the jeep given to Siriliya Saviya by the Red Cross contained biological remains of humans and explosive ingredients.
The CID conducting investigations into the murder of former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen informed Court that there is reliable information to support the fact that a Defender vehicle given to the Siriliya Saviya Foundation had been used to abduct former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen. The questionable vehicle is currently under CID custody.
At a previous occasion, the CID had filed a B report before the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court regarding a Defender vehicle bearing Number Plate WP KA-0642 found in Homagama belonging to the Siriliya Saviya Foundation.
The investigations have revealed that the original colour of the vehicle had been altered on two occasions on the instructions of Yoshitha Rajapaksa. The CID had told court that this vehicle had been used by Yoshitha Rajapaksa for his personal activities.
While delivering the verdict, former Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris on February 25, 2016 ruled that the death appeared to be a murder and ordered the CID Director to immediately arrest all suspects involved in the incident and produce them before Courts.
Thajudeen was killed, apparently, in a road accident in Colombo on May 17, 2012. The CID had informed court that investigations conducted so far had revealed that Thajudeens teeth had been broken, the bones in the pelvic region also broken and his neck pierced with a sharp instrument prior to his death.
The CID added that muscles in his legs had been cut with a piece of a broken glass. Earlier, police maintained that Thajudeen was driving to the airport and had lost control of his car and crashed into the Shalika Grounds wall at Park Road, Narahenpita, and that his vehicle had exploded within seconds of the crash.

Many faces of patriotism
Many writers outline the frightening parallels between the United States under Trump and the Weimar Republic in Germany under Hitler. That means no matter how and when the Trump presidency ends, the specter of non liberalism will continue to haunt American politics. Damage done will effect generations to come.
The failures of democratic governance have forged a society reminiscent of pre-war Germanyone in which theres a growing appetite for the kind of ultra nationalism espoused by Donald Trump influencing leaders like Mahinda in the third world too. Indeed, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has openly praised the Immigration Act of 1924, which not only created quotas and bans on certain immigrant communities but served as a model of sorts for Hitlers Mein Kampf.
The idea in fascism is an end product of capitalism to destroy liberal economic politics. Big corporatists side with politicians who use fascist tactics, because they are trying to divert peoples attention from the real forces that caused the genuine anxiety they feel. This mental condition is not exclusively or even primarily due to economic crisis. People of minority have suffered far greater hardship, and yet they are increasingly drawn to progressive left. With displacement and breakdown of traditions majority nationality is prone to look back with fantasy.
Fascist politics
Trump and his ilk like Mahinda are channeling a noxious strain of patriotism that creates nostalgia for a past that never existed. When the dominant group made to feel like theyre the victims in the face of all the facts, then it is clear that fascist politics is taking grip. The episode also plumbs the phenomenon of fake news, both how its constructed and deployed. Many of Aryan and Sinhala most cherished beliefs are based on mythologies; The notion that majority nationality is spreading damma and democracy to the rest of the world perhaps the deadliest of all such beliefs.
America has never been great, Trump concludes. But the idea of America can be great. Its a future thing, greatness, not a past thing. The past is something were trying to overcome, and were trying to realize our greatness with certain ideals. Here is Trump, and people being frightened about the echoes of fascism, not only in US but throughout the world. People world over really talk about society in disarray.
Theres an emotional feeling behind this, that what happens when societies fall apart, and when authoritarian figures hold up a notion of law and order, and the proper nationalism. Basically what they are talking about is mythology, and thats the Trump and Mahinda connection; they develop a mythology about the past, and about when Germany was great; now they have when America and Lanka were great. They use that as a springboard for basically developing us-them philosophy. That is the basic architecture for all such politics.
Black people
American tradition, in which the other was persecuted viciously, is continuing. It wasnt Donald Trump who is reminding, Americans have to be great by excluding people, which is basically Hitlers message too. He was trying to find some mythic, pure German. American did that with the Chinese Exclusion Act; rounded up the Japanese; before all that, had killed the Native Americans. American can talk all they want about their liberal tradition, but the thing that comes through in reading is immigrant-bashing, or incarceration of black people. Black people, male and female, represent 13 percent of the American population; theyre well over 50 percent of the imprisoned population that is now two and a half million people.
Pick on one word in particular, patriotism placed in so called architecture of fascism, patriotism, the pure German, make Germany great againthose exact words is, Hitlers messageand he was as odd a figure as Trump. Hitler, very much like Trump but he invoked some idea of the perfect Aryan, blonde German, and a mythical history, and he was doing this in a Germany thats falling apart. The echo that found there was this patriotism. Where does the ultimate madness come from If one is going to talk about Trump as a fascistic figure, he didnt invent himself; hes a productyes, his father was from Germany, and so forth. But the fact of the matter is Trump is a familiar figure in American life.
One doesnt want to deny the toxicity that certain forms of patriotism can take. Its just that, as American own history teachesfor example, the Civil Rights Movement, which took place in Alabama in the early 1960s, a terrifying place to hold it. That happened there, and those were Americans who did it.
Many want to honour their legacy and what they did to struggle for advances that, although sometimes its hard to see those advances in the face of mass incarceration and the various forms of anti-black racism and oppression of all of Americans that occurred after the Civil Rights Movement. However, Lankan or American have things in our past that are worth celebrating, and theyre worth celebrating because theyre connected to certain virtuous ideals.
Majority group
On the other hand, when patriotism takes the form that Americans are seeing it nowa nostalgia for a white past, a white Christian pastwhat fascism do is to create a sense of aggrieved, intense victimization by the majority group. Whenever the majority group feeling, yearning for a past that never was, where they got the appreciation they deserved, and feeling that this was taken away from themthats what fascism tries to do. It creates this mythic past so that the dominant group feels like theyre the worlds greatest victims.
When white Christians in the United States saying theyre the most discriminated group, then it is clear that fascist politics has taken hold and fascist politics is working the way it does. Thats what Hitler did in Germany. He constantly railed againstGermans were the greatest victims of world history.
He had Versailles agreement to use, of course, but he blamed Versailles, bizarrely, on Jews. He said the Germans are the greatest victims. So when the dominant group being made to feel like theyre terrible victims, in the face of all the facts, thats when fascist politics is taking grip. Its supposed to create this model, like, we once were victorious, we once ruled, and then foreign ideas came, and liberals made us share our power with foreign forces. Liberalism and Marxism destroyed our supremacy and destroyed this wonderful past where we ruled and our cultural traditions were the ones that dominated. Then it militarizes the feeling of nostalgia. All the anxiety and loss that people feel in their lives, say from the loss of their healthcare, the loss of their pensions, the loss of their stability, then gets rearranged into a sense that the real enemy is liberalism or leftism which led to the loss of this mythic past.

ABU DHABI, Thursday - Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed has been taken to hospital and did not take the field on day four of the second test against Australia after taking a blow to the helmet, while visiting batsman Usman Khawaja was ruled out with a knee injury.
Sarfraz was on 33 in Pakistans second innings on Wednesday in Abu Dhabi when a Peter Siddle bouncer struck his helmet.
The wicketkeeper brushed off the knock as he went on to make 81 off 123 balls, helping the hosts set a mammoth target of 538.
Asad Shafiq will lead Pakistan in his absence, while Mohammad Rizwan took the wicketkeeping gloves.
Australia were also dealt a major blow when it was confirmed that in-form opener Khawaja suffered a meniscal tear to his left knee that is likely to require surgery.
Khawaja, who has scored a match-saving 141 in the first test, is now a doubt for the start of the home series against India, which begins in Adelaide on Dec. 6.
Australia began day four on 47 for one, trailing by 491 and facing an uphill battle to avoid defeat.

Pocock wins Australia's top  rugby union award
SYDNEY, Friday - Influential flanker David Pocock capped his return from a sabbatical by being named Australian rugby union's best player by his peers on Friday, taking out the 2018 John Eales Medal.
The Wallabies talisman, with 262 votes, easily outpolled his nearest challengers -- Lukhan Tui (139) and Dane Haylett-Petty (132).
Pocock, who returned for the Ireland series in June after taking a year out to perform charity and educational work, earned the gong for a second time after also winning in 2010. He joins George Smith, Nathan Sharpe and Michael Hooper as two-time winners, with fullback Israel Folau the only player to win it three times.
The popular Pocock was also voted the fans choice for Wallaby of the year.
In other awards, the Queensland Reds Taniela Tupou, known as Tongan Thor, was named Australian Super Rugby player of the year. He also took the rookie of the year accolade. Wario was refused permission to have his passport returned to enable him to travel back to Austria to resume his duties as Kenya's ambassador to the country.
The other two ministry officials, Haron Komen, who was the administrative secretary and financial officer Patrick Kimithi Nkabwa, also pleaded not guilty.
A total of 55 million shillings ($545,000) was allegedly misappropriated during the Rio Olympics.

President strikes perfect balance
Striking the headlines repeatedly this week, President Maithripala Sirisena brought new emphasis to his political message at home, raised concerns from India, and punctuated the growing differences between the UNP and SLFP in the governing coalition.
The big headline that bothered India on the involvement of RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) in an alleged assassination plot on him, saw a clarification from the Presidents Media Office; but not before the Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhi having to call on him for direct clarification, and also move to a quick phone call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to deny reports of his comments in the Cabinet, and ensure cordial relations.
The clarification said the President had not mentioned any involvement of an Indian intelligence service, in comments he made at Tuesdays Cabinet meeting, on the alleged assassination plot under investigation.
The clarification apart, the story had very wide and prominent spread in the media, both in Sri Lanka and India. The absence of a direct and firm contradiction (possibly leading to apologies from the media), certainly led to the story having its own impact in the current context of anti-Indian thinking on investment and political strategies in the country. The heightened pro-nationalist trend of those opposed to the Indian LIOC and CPC agreement on the Trinco Oil Tank Farm, and opposition to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes support for Indian participation in the East Container Terminal in the Port of Colombo (also stated at the same Cabinet meeting), did give content to political thinking critical of major international powers involvement in the emerging development trends in the country. Such nationalist thinking is in keeping with the political trends of the President, the theme of his recent statement at the UN General Assembly.
While the immediate possibilities of wrong understandings with India have been prevented, this certainly gives some room to the revival of political trends where former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, and critics of the governing coalition, did name RAW having a role in the election of Common Candidate in the Presidential Poll in January 2015.
There is also the actuality that RAW, being an intelligence service, its role and functioning is not necessarily part of official government announcements by India. The emerging political changes in Sri Lanka, with delayed and coming elections, will certainly lead to many foreign intelligence services having a sharper eye on trends over here.
Ranil in India
During his current visit to India, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at a meeting with PM Narendra Modi, will further clarify and underscore rejection of the alleged RAW plot on assassination of President Sirisena.
Both leaders are expected to review the status of the India-assisted housing projects in Jaffna. Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will also meet with PM Wickremesinghe.
The Sri Lankan PM will seek to strengthen close contacts with India, which is among the top four investors here, with cumulative investments of over one billion dollars since 2003, and continuing to rise, in diverse areas from petroleum services, IT, financial services, and Sri Lanka being Indias largest trading partner in the SAARC region.
Headline scores
Another headline was the decision of President Sirisena this week was the dissolving of the Boards of Directors of three key State financial institutions  the Bank of Ceylon, Peoples Bank and the Board of Investment. This followed continued reports and allegations of corruption and misappropriation of funds in these key institutions, with the call for thorough investigations into the related affairs.
The President acted with his role in economic affairs, while the two major banks function under the Ministry of Finance, and the Board of Investment serves under the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, which are ministries under the UNP. There have been recent reports in the media about a UNP politician being allegedly involved in seeking a huge sum of illegal funding from an investor in an infrastructure facility. The Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank were given instructions by the former Finance Minister on bidding at the now exposed Treasury bond auctions.
The emerging political trends that seek to drive further divisions between the majority UNP and minority SLFP in the ruling coalition, would have impelled the move to remove these Boards of Directors, and bring about new appointments that would move away from UNP influence and dominance in economic and financial affairs.
Thebuvana
Another headline of the President was the donation of Rs. 1 million by President Sirisena to the family members of Police Sergeant Gunawardena, who carried out an armed public protest against the decision of the OIC of the Thebuvana Police to release a lorry load of illegally transported sand, which the Sergeant had seized for legal action.
The Sergeant has also been reinstated, after action initiated against him for the public protest carrying a police T-56 weapon, after the release of the lorry.
The President has certainly recognized the anger of the sergeant at what seems the corrupt action of the OIC in charge of this matter. This could be a message to senior police personnel to be more concerned about the need for honesty in police activities. It is also of interest in the context of the Presidents own description of the IGP Pujith Jayasundara as a joker, and the joke that police functioning has become. It does raise questions about the unauthorized carrying of weapons.
The Johnston release
The headline certainly went in a different direction with the acquittal of former Minister Johnston Fernando, and Kurunegala SLFP MP, and two others, over the alleged misappropriation of Rs. 5.2 million from SATHOSA in the run up to the North-Western Provincial election in 2013. Mr. Fernando and others held in remand custody since the case began in September this year, were released by the Kurunegala High Court following contradiction in evidence led by the FCID, and allegations of a witness being forced to write suspect vouchers.
This is the first major case that has been thus concluded, relating to the alleged corruption of those involved with the former Rajapaksa regime. It is certainly a major media hit for the Rajapaksa team, now mainly SLPP, and with more public interest due to the new indictments in the corruption and fraud cases before, and to be filed, at the special Trials at Bar.
Mahinda Rajapaksa has said action would be filed against the FCID for presenting false evidence in this case. It is a major scoring point for the Rajapaksa regime and its team who claim that corruption charges against those of the Rajapaksa family are politically motivated. The Johnston release will certainly be part of the mounting propaganda against the much delayed anti-corruption moves of the government.
The important aspect of this acquittal that is ignored by the Rajapaksas, and not highlighted by the government, is that it is proof of the much wider independence of the judiciary that prevails today. While corrupt persons would never have been brought before the courts under the Rajapaksa regime, there was hardly a chance for anyone charged by the then government to be discharged or acquitted by a court.
Police puzzle
The CID has recorded a statement from DIG Nalaka de Silva, for nearly nine hours on Thursday when he arrived there one day late, and will be further questioned, in the investigation into the alleged plot to assassinate President Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. It is interesting to note that Nalaka de Silva has now been interdicted, following recommendations on this to the National Police Commission by Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara.
It is certainly baffling why the Police Commission is needed to interdict a senior police officer, involving an alleged plot to assassinate the Head of State and the former Secretary, Defence. This certainly relates to the puzzling actions of the IGP on this matter. The DIG of the Terrorism Investigation Division, was first transferred to the Police IT Division, as the inquiries began. After this led to criticism, he was sent on Compulsory Leave. Now, it has required a recommendation from the Minister in charge to the NPC, and it is own recommendation to interdict the man. What is this befuddling performance of the IGP Is it part of his specialty in dancing, involving the Rules and Regulations of the Police Department
As this inquiry proceeds, it is best that proper action is taken on this probe, without it leading to anymore unwanted headlines, that can pose problems or both Law and Order here, and relations with our neighbouring countries.
The headline strikes could be good publicity in the short run, but as seen this week, could be dangerous packaging in the wider and longer run, even in the secrecy of the Cabinet.

Sajith exposes Opposition plot
Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa yesterday accused the Joint Opposition of trying to undermine the flow of foreign aid to the country fearing that it could erode their vote base ahead of the up-coming elections.
As India poured over 1,200 million rupees to build houses for the poor and pledged more cash for construction, members of the former Rajapaksa regime feared they would have to remain in the Opposition.
If the country returns to them, they will stop releasing land to the landless and keep it for themselves. They will not build houses for the poor, but instead build mansions for themselves. Lands forcibly occupied by them will be acquired at low prices and sold to foreigners at high prices.
Should there be a change of this democracy and a dictatorship returns, then the national agenda will be about one royal family.
Remember, if there is a change it is not you who will get land, houses and reawakened villages, but everything will be centered on one family, he added.
He reminded that the previous regime did not allow any political dissent and one who spoke against the then government was abducted in white vans and disappeared.
He also lamented that there had been hardly any coverage for Indias generous gift of 1,200 million rupees for housing for the poor, but the Opposition was spreading falsehoods about rifts within the Cabinet and clashes between the President and the Premier.
The Opposition was also trying to create falsehoods of rifts between President Maithripala Sirisena and India to undermine their strong ties that resulted in a greater assistance to the country.
Today we have strengthened democracy, there is discussion in Cabinet unlike under the former regime when ministers could not even go to the toilet without getting permission from the king (Mahinda Rajapaksa), Minister Premadasa said.
He said there was deep discussions when taking decisions in sharp contrast to the dictatorial nature of the Rajapaksa regime where the ruling family took all the decisions and ministers were mere rubber stamps.
They are trying to say the President and the Prime Minister are fighting. India and Sri Lanka are at loggerheads, but nothing can be further from the truth.
Today we have a true form of cabinet government. In the past, ministers did not have any freedom to speak out. Today there is freedom to speak in and outside the Cabinet.
He said elements within the Opposition were enacting an Oscar-winning script to undermine the work of the government as well as relations with neighbouring India.
The Housing Minister said India was prepared to finance more housing projects in the country to help the needy people and the Opposition was unhappy about the welfare schemes that the government has been able to deliver.

Sarfraz, Paine agree wrecker-in-chief Abbas is the best
ABU DHABI, Friday - Rival captains Sarfraz Ahmed and Tim Paine were unanimous in their praise of wicket-taking sensation Mohammad Abbas, who helped Pakistan thrash Australia in the second Test in Abu Dhabi on Friday.
The 28-year-old seamer took 5 for 62 as Australia, set a colossal 538-run target, were bowled out for 164 on the fourth afternoon in their worst-ever defeat against Pakistan, losing by 373 runs at Sheikh Zayed Stadium.
Abbas finished with 10 for 95 for the match after taking 5 for 33 in the first innings, ending up as man-of-the-series with 17 wickets in two Tests.
Sarfraz claimed Australia weren't ready for Abbas, who was also named man-of-the-series on Pakistan's trip to England earlier this year.
Looks like they hadn't prepared for Abbas, they took him a little easy, said Sarfraz.
Australia entered the two-Test series focused on the threat of leg-spinner Yasir Shah, although he managed just eight wickets.
But credit goes to Abbas, because the pitch is not suitable for fast bowlers, said Sarfraz.
The way he bowled, he was the best bowler on either side. The way he bowled throughout he was the main factor for us winning the series.
Abbas took seven wickets in the first Test which Australia drew after a determined fightback on the fifth day in Dubai.
Sarfraz said both teams were missing experienced players, with Pakistan's Test unit in a transition phase after last year's retirement of senior batsmen Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq.
Australia were without key batsmen Steve Smith and David Warner -- both banned a year for their role in the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa in March.
I am not so surprised at this win, said Sarfraz. Both teams are missing senior players. The way my team played the first match, we almost won it but couldnt. The way we recovered from 57-5 on day one was remarkable.
Paine agreed with Sarfraz's assessment of Abbas, the first Pakistani fast bowler to take a 10-wicket haul in a Test since Mohammad Asif against Sri Lanka at Kandy in 2006.
Abbas is a world-class bowler, said Paine.
He (Abbas) challenged our defence and was too good for us. Yasir didnt get the wickets, but he bowled just as well. Over here, one of the things our bowlers talked about was building pressure from both ends. That is what Pakistan did really well together.
Paine, who took over the captaincy in the wake of Smith's suspension, said the defeat was hard to swallow.
It's bitterly disappointing, no doubt. We had some momentum from the first Test, started really well here but it went a bit pear-shaped to be honest all over the field, he said.
It's hard to swallow. We came here to win this series and we did OK in the first Test and showed at least some fight and showed the style and brand of cricket we wanted to play.
Pakistan and Australia now head into a series of three Twenty20 internationals, with the first in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.  AFP

Two cases filed against Shashi Weerawansa, wife of National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa over an incident where Shashi Weerawansa had fraudulently obtained two passports including a diplomatic passport by submitting forged documents to the Department of Immigration and Emigration, were yesterday re-fixed for trial on November 15, by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake.
Attorney-at-Law Buddhika Mallawaarachchi appearing on behalf of Shashi Weerawansa, sought another date for trial since Senior Defence Counsel Anil Silva PC, was not present in Court.
The Defence Counsel informed Court that his client would not be able to appear before the Court Registrar next Friday (26), owing to an alms giving ceremony at her residence.
Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris stated that it is inappropriate for an accused being appearing before the Courts Registrar. At a previous occasion too, the preceding Magistrate had ordered the accused to appear before the CID every last Sunday of each month. Later on, this order had been changed, enabling the accused to appear before the Courts Registrar, DSG Peiris added.
Shashi Weerawansa was arrested on February 2015, over the charge of obtaining diplomatic and general passports illegally. She had allegedly submitted a birth certificate with forged names and dates of birth in obtaining the passports. She is currently out on bail.

Principal of Visakha Vidyalaya, Sandamalie Aviruppola too notes that a child should be punished in a constructive way.
At present parents give almost everything a child asks for. Children do not know their limits. Thus I believe they should be disciplined and corrected in a constructive way. In my school we mostly advice children and follow up their marks and performance. The teachers personality and attitudes also affect the children. So they should be trained and updated to avoid these negative issues that happen in schools, she explained.
Many schools have refrained themselves from corporal punishment after the topic came under the limelight but punishments such as pinching, bullying, knuckle knocking on head, slapping the students palms with a ruler, making the students kneel down, twisting ears, blows on the back, and making the students clean the classroom, laboratory or playground are still practiced.
Painful and humiliating
Eighteen-year-old David J A, a student from Jaffna says he has experienced corporal punishment and so has everyone else in his class.
I feel that corporal punishment is a truly awful method of attempting to discipline a child. Speaking from my own school experience, there are a plethora of reasons for why this practice should be banned. Firstly, it is naturally painful and humiliating for the child. In addition, despite what some may say, from my experience over the last six years, corporal punishment does not work in the slightest. In fact, it only causes the students to resent that teacher even more. No matter what beating is dealt out the instant that teacher leaves the classroom, the students continue to behave the same way as they did before being caught, he said.
David says other punishments, lacking violence, are more effective in getting students to behave. Each time I was beaten, the beating is dealt out without any inquiry or understanding of the situation. In my cases, the teacher has either failed to listen to why I've been unable to do something, or has caught me instead of the person responsible for disrupting the class. Hitting first is what has happened to me and many others in my class. There is no asking first or even later, he explained.
Horribly wrong message
He added that most importantly corporal punishment sends out a horribly wrong message that violence is right. In my school, there are many students who believe that corporal punishment is the right way to discipline children. Until very recently, when they were told to refrain from doing so, prefects also used this view to beat students themselves. I've even been told by a prefect, whom I'd argued with about corporal punishment, that physical punishment is a part of our culture and it is the only thing our people understand. The abuse is rarely just physical, but also involves taunting and insulting. Usually this is done in front of the entire class, and is sometimes, from what I've witnessed, even done to cause amusement for the other students. I sincerely hope that people come to understand these views and realise the kind of life many children in our country must go through, while studying in our schools, David said.
Around 131 countries including Sri Lanka have taken an enlightened stand and significant steps to ban Corporal Punishment. The Stop Child Cruelty organization together with some experts in the field, some leading figures in the country and a number of religious dignitaries recently launched a programme to seek and end corporal punishment in schools in Sri Lanka permanently by 2020. They have roped leading entrepreneur, philanthropist and fashion icon Otara Gunawardena and former Sri Lankan cricketer Sidath Wettimuny as their patrons. Luckshi Ranasinghe is the Youth Ambassador of the campaign. Walk for Genuine Change, a walk to ban corporal punishment was held recently from Independence Square in Colombo by Stop Child Cruelty. They also delivered a petition signed by concerned citizens and the Pentagon Proposal with five overarching key components, referring to the responsible main arms of the government essential to end corporal punishment, to President Maithripala Sirisena.
The golden rule is to make loveable to the child everything you wish him or her to love. Love the children adequately and intelligently understanding their needs, and become good models rather than critics.

Ten-wicket Abbas destroys Australia for Pakistan's series win
Abu Dhabi, Friday: Medium pacer Mohammad Abbas took his maiden ten-wicket haul in a match to fire Pakistan to a 373-run win over Australia in the second Test in Abu Dhabi on Friday.
Abbas followed his 5-33 in the first innings with figures of 5-62 to wreck Australia for 164.
The victory, after Australia were set a 538-run target, allowed Pakistan to wrap up the two-match series 1-0 after Australia fought back to draw the first Test in Dubai last week.
It was Australia's heaviest defeat against Pakistan, beating the 356-run hammering at this same venue four years ago.
It was Abbas, 28, who destroyed Australia with a haul of 17 wickets in the series -- becoming the first Pakistani fast bowler to take ten wickets in a Test since Mohammad Asif did so against Sri Lanka at Kandy in 2006.
Abbas had jolted Australia with four wickets off just 23 balls while Yasir Shah finished with 3-45 to give Pakistan their tenth series win on the neutral venues of United Arab Emirates.
They have only lost one series -- 2-0 to Sri Lanka last year -- since being forced to play their home matches in UAE since 2009.
Pakistan were forced to play their home matches in UAE since attacks on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore in March 2009.
Australia's batsmen had no answers to his accurate seam bowling under cloudy conditions at Sheikh Zayed Stadium as only Marnus Labuschagne (43), Travis Head (36) and Aaron Finch (31) offered some resistance.
Yasir dismissed number ten Jon Holland soon after lunch to hand Pakistan victory.
The first Test ended in a draw in Dubai last week.
Australian opener Usman Khawaja could not bat after suffering a recurrence of a knee injury during practice on Thursday.
Abbas jolted the Australians in the seventh over of the day when he removed a solid-looking Head, getting an edge to substitute wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan, deputising for Sarfraz Ahmed.
Sarfraz, who was hit on the helmet by a rising Mitchell Starc delivery on Thursday, had gone for a precautionary scan which came back clear.
Sarfraz was full of praise for Abbas, the man of the match.
"The way Abbas has bowled all series is one of the biggest positives for us," said Sarfraz.
"All the youngsters who have come through in recent times have done well. We have to groom them all to become a good Test team," said Sarfraz.
Australian skipper Tim Paine said his side had thrown away a chance to win the match.
"Obviously really disappointing to have them five for 57 on day one and we let that opportunity slip," said Paine.
"Abbas challenged our defence time and time again. There's certainly no sugar coating that we've got some real issues with our batting." AFP

Top 10 cricketers with most Man of the Match awards in ODI cricket
In cricket, there is a key contest between bat and ball on the 22 yards and each player on the green turf puts in his best foot forward in the role assigned to them. Every team needs to have the right combination of batsmen and bowlers to strike a good balance and have the winning edge over the opposition. A team needs to be equipped with players of different skills sets to win you a game. Coming to batting, teams look for explosive openers at the top, dependable sheet anchors in the middle order and power hitters at the death to finish off games. On similar lines, a good blend of potent seamers and quality spinners is a must for having the much-required variation in the bowling line-up. In ODI cricket, a team needs to have a couple of match winners in their tanks who can change the course of a game on their own. A match winner needs to possess multiple qualities like good match awareness, calm demeanour to soak in the pressure and keen understanding of the oppositions game plan besides excelling in his predefined role in the team.
Over the years we have seen like ODI greats like Brian Lara, Sachin Tendulkar, Sanath Jayasuriya, Wasim Akram, Shane Warne and Brett Lee giving the cutting edge to their respective sides with their ability to win matches. Over the last five years batting maestros like Virat Kohli, AB De Villiers, David Warner, Quinton De Cock, Rohit Sharma and Babar Azam have contributed tremendously with the willow to win ODI matches for their respective sides. Similarly, the likes of Mitchell Starc, Kagiso Rabada, Jasprit Bumrah, Trent Boult and Rashid Khan have bowled some exceptional spells to win matches for their teams.
These players are the impact players who can get the team across the finishing line by putting in incredible performances with either bat or ball on a consistent basis.
So let us have a look at the top ten international cricketers who have won the most man of the match awards in ODI cricket. Before we run through the list, honourable mentions to those cricketers who won 25 or more man of the match awards in ODIs.

The ever-dependable left-hander along with Mahela Jayawardene became the backbone of the Sri Lankan batting order, scoring heaps of runs for almost two decades. Sanga stepped up his game at major tournaments and notably scored four centuries at the 2015 World Cup.

In an era where most batsmen played with a defensive mindset and technically correct stroke play, Richards pioneered and successfully deployed an attacking dimension to his batting. He was a nightmare of most bowlers as he punished them severely if they slightly erred in line or length.

He played some destructive cameos down the order to win many nerve-racking encounters for his nation. A darling with the Pakistani fans, Afridis inconsistent yet enthralling kept the fans at the edge of their seats.
When on song, Afridi tore apart attacks with his lusty ball striking which usually produced some towering sixes. There are few batsmen who could hit the red cherry harder than the Karachi Pathan. Afridi was a quality leg-spinner who deceived the batsman with his quickish leg spinners which skidded off the surface.
Afridi was pretty athletic in the initial part of his career and was an exceptional fielder in the backward point and covers region.

Batting at the number three position with a typical Proteas upright stance and compact technique, Kallis was the workhorse of Proteas batting lineup, providing stability to the innings. Although he was more of a run grafter, he could also use the long handle to great effect.
Kallis was a genuine seam bowler who got decent seam movement out off his outswingers, scalping over 200 ODI wickets for the Proteas. He proved to be an effective third seamer to pace greats like Allan Donald, Shaun Pollock and later on to Dale Steyn. Kallis had a safe pair of hands and took some sharp catches in the slips.

The diminutive opener took the world by storm with his pinch-hitting exploits in the 1996 World Cup and established himself as a fearless opener in white ball cricket.
Jayasurya used his terrific hand-eye coordination and brute bottom hand power to score some whirlwind tons up the order. A fierce cutter and puller, Jayasuriya ended up as Sri Lankas greatest match-winner scoring over 13000 ODI runs with 28 tons. Sanath was also a clever customer with the ball, darting in those spinners at the death overs and choking the opposition for runs.
ODIs- 445Man of the Match Awards - 48
1. SACHIN TENDULKAR
Sachin was the batting lynch pin of the Indian ODI team for almost two decades. The Master Blaster hailed as the greatest batsman in the modern era was Indias greatest match winner with the willow. Sachin had the penchant of scoring match winning hundreds with superlative consistency and taking the team across the finishing line. In the late 90 and first decade of the new millennium, the Indian teams fortunes in white ball cricket were heavily dependent on Sachins run-scoring exploits. Sachin racked up a staggering 51 ODI centuries. Besides his prolific run-scoring with the bat, he was a pretty handy bowler who scalped over 150 ODI wickets with his mixed bag of deliveries. Tendulkar won the most number of man of the match awards in a glittering career which saw him make over 450 appearances.

All trade unions could be labeled as  Terrorists Organizations under the new Terrorism Prevention Act, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
The GMOA requests the President to find out whether the Health Minister had undertaken a local or foreign contract to destroy the entire free health service and medical education in Sri Lanka. The GMOA will take islandwide trade union action without further notice if the issues was not solved within one week, he added.

Victory for free healthcare
In yet another victory for Sri Lankas free healthcare system, a global study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has revealed that Sri Lankans will be living at least five years longer (80 years) by 2040. The present life expectancy figures are 78.5 (female) and 72.1 (male), according to World Health Organisation (WHO).
Sri Lanka is one of the few Asian countries to achieve the honour of surpassing the landmark 80 years, along with Japan (ranked second in the study at 85.7 years), Singapore (third ranked at 85.4), China, South Korea and Thailand. Spain, famous for the Mediterranean diet of its laid-back inhabitants, has topped the study with 85.7 years. Among the other countries in the top 10 are Australia, Portugal, France, Israel, Italy and Switzerland. By comparison, many developed countries including USA have been ranked below Sri Lanka. Lesotho, the Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Somalia and Swaziland are in the bottom. For the world as a whole, the researchers projected a five-year gain in lifespan, from 73.8 in 2016 to 77.7 in 2040. This is a vindication of successive Sri Lankan Governments commitment to free healthcare. Even foreigners admitted to Government hospitals get free treatment. In fact, apart from the longevity factor, most other health indices for Sri Lanka are on par with those of the developed world. Our heath system has been studied and copied by many other countries in the region.
Longevity has increased practically all over the world (except perhaps in sub-Saharan Africa) thanks to advances in medicine and healthcare. In fact, scientists believe that the first person to live to 150 years has already been born somewhere in the world. Many diseases which used to be deadly, including AIDS, have been controlled successfully. Some diseases have been eradicated from our midst. WHO-led vaccination, though a controversial subject in certain countries, has saved millions of children. Surgeries are commonplace for coronary heart diseases and kidney diseases. Organ transplants are saving thousands of lives per year. Replacement of parts such as knee caps has enabled thousands of older people to lead active and healthy lives. Scientists are working on more artificial parts and organs, from hearts to eyes. Such surgeries could be common by 2040.
Even as the world has successfully grappled with communicable diseases such as TB, a bigger threat has emerged from Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease. The study took a look at some of the conditions that are shortening people's lives, and projects a significant increase in deaths from NCDs including diabetes, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, chronic kidney disease and lung cancer. Tobacco consumption alone claims about seven million lives each year, according to WHO. The study also warns of worsening health outcomes linked to obesity, with at least 300 million people suffering from the condition already. The top five health factors that explain most of the future trajectory for premature death are high blood pressure, high body mass index, high blood sugar and tobacco and alcohol abuse. Air pollution ranked sixth. Injuries sustained as a result of motor accidents and home and workplace incidents are also likely to increase.
As the studys lead author Kyle Foreman, head of data science at (IHME) notes the future of the world's health is not pre-ordained  indeed there could be positive developments that could stop these diseases dead in their tracks. A cure for cancer, the holy grail of science and medicine, alone could save millions of lives per year. Artificial lungs and hearts could also be available by 2040, which will make it easier to treat patients who need life-saving surgery.
A projected proliferation of electric vehicles by 2040 (incidentally the cut-off date for the registration of fossil fuel vehicles in many countries including Sri Lanka) and the greater use of renewable energy could drastically reduce air pollution. Fully autonomous, driverless cars are likely to cause far less accidents, thereby reducing accident injuries. There will be more effective, cheaper drugs for many diseases by 2040. As famed scientists Stephen Hawking predicts in his final essay published posthumously in the Sunday Times of London, there could be a breed of super humans by 2040-2050 who would use genetic engineering to get rid of disease, design perfect bodies and live to 150-200 years. This is very much in the realm of possibility.
But the biggest challenge posed by a silver generation world is finding productive vocations for the elderly who will still be physically and mentally fit. Many countries have already raised the retirement age to 60 or 65, but it is important to ensure that they can make productive use of time and make a contribution to the economy even after 65. Over the next 30 years the number of over-65s is expected to reach 1.3 billion, outnumbering children for the first time. Already, the number of people in the world 65 and over is increasing at an average of 870,000 each month. Governments around the world must come up with programmes that not only add years to their lives but also life to their years.

England look to wrap up series at Pallekele:
We want to turn it around as much as the fans  Sadeera
PALLEKELE, Friday  Sadeera Samarawickrama one of Sri Lankas talented young batsmen expressed the views of his team that they were keen to put a stop to their current losing trend and turn the corner in one-day international cricket where they have lost the formula to win consistently.
Wins in the last two ODIs of the five-match series against South Africa followed by a win in the one-off T20I against the same opposition raised hopes that Sri Lanka had finally broken away from the shackles only to be dealt a stunning blow in the Asia Cup with heavy defeats at the hands of Bangladesh and Afghanistan.
The ongoing five-match series sees Sri Lanka fighting to stay alive knowing well that another defeat in the fourth ODI at the Pallekele International Stadium today would see England take a winning 3-0 lead.
Whats needed at the moment is to get a win for the team. Everyone knows weve had some setbacks. We have to think about how to get that win, and Im trying to use my talents for the teams good. More than playing for my place in the team, Im trying to get a win, said Samarawickrama at the pre-match press conference yesterday.
I know the spectators must be very disappointed about the way we have played. But we also want to turn it around. We want to see the fans happy.
If we think too much about the World Cup right now, well be under even more pressure when we get to the next match. We have to take it series by series and match by match as a team. Weve got three series before the World Cup. What we want to do is get used to those conditions, and go from a losing mental state to a winning one, he said.
Samarawickrama who replaced Upul Tharanga in the third ODI which was curtailed to 21 overs a side, gave his team a great start with a stand of 57 off 33 balls with Niroshan Dickwella only to see all their efforts erode away as the middle order failed to keep up the good work and Sri Lanka eventually ended up with a moderate total of 150-9 which England knocked off quite comfortably to win by seven wickets with 15 balls to spare.
We know we cant win the series from here, we have to come back strongly and level it. Mostly we have to execute our basic plans. Our batsmen have to take up the responsibility and get a big score. If were chasing we have to chase the score. Mostly we have to come back with the batting side, said Samarawickrama.
ENGLAND BOWLERS HAVE CLEVER VARIATIONS
Their fast bowlers are really clever. They have good slower balls and variation balls. We got a good start, and we didnt think something like that would happen in the middle. We thought wed be able to get a good score if we batted well through the middle. Hopefully well be able to capitalise on good starts through our middle order in the coming games. Weve talked about that and formulated a plan now.
England are the no.1 team and there is a big challenge when we play against them. But we can beat any team if we -play to our potential. We need to do our basics right. If we do that not only England, we could also beat India. England is very strong, but we need to play better, he said.
Samarawickrama returned to the Lankan ODI side after a lapse of ten months and expressing his thoughts said that he would prefer opening the innings because it is in that position that he had scored a lot of runs.
When they told me Id be opening, I got a lot of confidence. Its not that I dont like batting in the middle order, but that I like to play at the top.
I was able to handle the pressure because in the recent past its while Ive been opening that Ive scored a lot of runs. I took that confidence forward. I didnt put it in my head that I was playing England, or think too seriously about it. I just did the basics, said Samarawickrama who scored 35 off 34 balls in the third ODI.
I just came from playing provincial and mercantile tournaments, and when you compare it theres a big difference.
The way you have to think about the game is very different at this level. Bowlers are often smarter than us, so we have to plan for that and think a step ahead of them. Weve got to be clever and make good decisions as a team, he said.
CHANDIMAL FIT TO PLAY
Skipper Dinesh Chandimal was cleared to play in todays game after suffering from dizziness in the third ODI where he left the field during the England innings and did not take any further part.
Chandimal had some dizziness after the last match, but we did all the tests, and hes 100 percent fit, said team manager Charith Senanayake.
Strangely the past two days have been dry with no rain around and it is hoped it will remain that way today so that we get a full game of cricket which the series has not had so far.

Why on earth are England touring Sri Lanka in their monsoon season
There is one simple reason why England are touring Sri Lanka in their monsoon season and have seen all three one-day internationals so far affected by heavy rain. Greed.
It is the greed of administrators - the International Cricket Council, the ECB and the Sri Lankan board - that sees them cramming more and more fixtures into an already overcrowded schedule.
And that greed has led to a staggering arrogance and disregard for supporters who have paid good money to watch England on this beautiful island and players who will increasingly be hurried towards burn-out.
If there is ever a blank week in crickets international calendar then you can be sure that one desperate board or other will quickly schedule a one-day or Twenty20 series to fill the gap and make even more money.
The concept of less is more and protecting the quality of the product is anathema to cricket administrators worldwide.
The result is that Sri Lanka, who are committed to tour New Zealand in December, are entertaining England at the worst possible time because there is just no other month when they can be fitted into the Future Tours Programme.
It is a situation compounded by Englands status as the only team who now play all year round in a desperate attempt to keep everyone happy and the cash tills rolling.
Sri Lanka saw what was coming when they changed their original plan to begin the tour with three Tests and flipped it to start with the white-ball fixtures, causing chaos to Eoin Morgan and Liam Plunketts wedding plans in the process. The theory was that they might be able to get away with the odd one-day game when the rain can be so regular and persistent that it is just about the only time when Sri Lankan tour operators discourage holidays. No chance.
And they compounded their folly by scheduling reserve days for just two of the five matches - the second and fifth - while making three of them day-night affairs even though the rain tends to come in late afternoon.
It can, of course, be a lottery and Sri Lanka will remind us that England toured in October 11 years ago and there was not a single drop of rain throughout the trip. This time their luck has simply run out.
The situation can only get worse. Every year seems to be Englands busiest yet - dont even look at 2019 and the early part of 2020 - and the emergence of more and more franchise tournaments can only add to the problem.
Players, of course, can be their own worst enemies. Why Joe Root is playing in Australias Big Bash in December when it is his only chance of rest before next years World Cup and the Ashes is anyones guess.
Yet the biggest names do not want to miss out on Twenty20 riches while still feeling obliged to play for England in all formats and ensure that spectators who pay so much to watch the national team do not feel short-changed.
Frankly it is a mess and cricket only has itself to blame.
In the short term all that those shameless administrators can do is count their money while keeping their fingers firmly crossed that the sun shines on the rest of Englands tour. Dont bet on it.

Wimbledon to introduce  final set tie-breaks
LONDON, Friday - Wimbledon will introduce tie-breaks in the final set of all events for the first time next year, but only once the score in the deciding set reaches 12-12, the All England Lawn Tennis Club announced on Friday.
Our view was that the time had come to introduce a tie-break method for matches that had not reached their natural conclusion at a reasonable point during the deciding set, said the club's chairman Philip Brook.
A tie-break is normally played to decide the set when the score reaches 6-6. However, until now the US Open has been the only Grand Slam that uses a tie-break in the fifth set.
In this year's Wimbledon men's final, South African Kevin Anderson lost to Novak Djokovic in straight sets less than two days after beating John Isner 26-24 in the fifth set after more than six-and-a-half hours on court.
Djokovic's own five-set semi-final victory over Rafael Nadal also had to be played over two days due to the delay in a conclusion to the Anderson-Isner match.
While we know the instances of matches extending deep into the final set are rare, we feel that a tie-break at 12-12 strikes an equitable balance between allowing players ample opportunity to complete the match to advantage, while also providing certainty that the match will reach a conclusion in an acceptable timeframe, added Brook.
The AELTC said it had studied data from the past 20 years at Wimbledon, as well as consulting players and officials before reaching the decision.
Big-serving American Isner was also famously involved in the longest match in Wimbledon history when he beat France's Nicolas Mahut 70-68 in the deciding set in 2010 after over 11 hours on court over three days. - AFP
