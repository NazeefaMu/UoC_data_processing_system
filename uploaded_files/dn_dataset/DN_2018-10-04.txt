Everyone should work towards rooting out corruption
President Maithripala Sirisena said everyone is duty bound to work towards rooting out corruption, waste and fraud, with the aim of creating a humane society. Corruption, waste and fraud should be eradicated promptly with the assistance of all stakeholders of society, the President said.
The President was speaking at a ceremony to mark Samatha Dinaya at Temple Trees yesterday. Members of the Samatha Mandala from across the country participated.
All sections of society should rally round to do away with fraud, waste, bribery and corruption. It is the bounden duty of every Sri Lankan to form a corruption-free country. Regardless of whether you are from a village or town, you have to work towards this objective, the President said.
He added that bribery, waste and corruption are rooted in society and therefore it is not easy to eradicate. However, we should act promptly to wipe out these evils from society. 
Speaking on the Samatha Mandalas values, the President said that the Samatha Mandala renders an immense service to society in ensuring law and order. Besides, the Samatha Mandala is an ideal solution for easing the congestion in courts. 
The President said that Samatha Mandala volunteers dedicate their time, wealth and much more for the benefit of society. Even though the Samatha Mandala system was established 28 years ago, it has never been said that even a single member has acted with a personal agenda or bias. This demonstrates how dedicated the members are. You are doing an honorary service without hoping for any gain. 
The President said that ceremonies of this nature will help to achieve the objectives of the Samatha Mandala.

Advantis builds school utilizing upcycled shipping containers
Advantis Engineering, a subsidiary of Hayleys Advantis Limited, recently completed the design, construction and installation of the first school to be built out of shipping containers,  The Headway School of Languages in Batticaloa.
Utilizing the companys innovative space solution, Convertainers, this latest project, comprising of 32 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), is one of the largest constructions handled by Advantis Engineering requiring a total of 75 days to complete.
The difficulty in creating a building is often lost on those who have access to the resources of Colombo. Gathering the necessary labour and equipment - from the plumbers to the cement mixers - becomes a challenge as you leave urban centers.
Despite the daunting logistical challenges of coordinating a construction across the island from a factory in Colombo, Advantis Engineering managed to deliver a life changing solution to the people of Batticaloa, through their Convertainers concept. Advantis Engineering handled the entire process, end-to-end, delivering a solution that was focused on creating lasting change in a sustainable fashion.
Convertainers by Advantis Engineering, is a novel space solution built by utilizing upcycled freight containers under ISO standards. These units are expected to have a 25 year lifespan with all after sales and maintenance being provided by Advantis Engineering. The prefabricated and modular nature of Convertainers allows them to be tailored to meet any specific need with even future additions to the structure made possible without disruption to ongoing operations, saving both time and money.
The Convertainers concept has gained wide global popularity in recent years. However in order to meet the growing space needs of businesses today, single unit containers will not be sufficient. Being one of few companies in Sri Lanka to offer complex Convertainer solutions that allow for the construction of multi-level buildings, Advantis Engineering provides its clients with a distinct advantage.
Our Convertainers are the foremost innovation in space solutions. They give our customers a quick, easily made and unique office space that can continue to be customized as their business grows over the years, said Kamal Wimalaratne, General Manager of Advantis Engineering. We are delighted to have constructed this beautiful building for the Headway School of Languages and to have played a small part in their ongoing journey to enrich the lives of the next generation of Sri Lankans.
The Headway School of Languages is the authorized Sri Lankan and Maldivian channel partner for DynEd International, inc. Headway is dedicated to bringing language learning to the masses across the island through language schools which will also connect people to exceptional educational opportunities.
As a subsidiary of Hayleys Advantis Limited, the transportation and logistics arm of Hayleys PLC, Advantis Engineering, constantly strives to provide innovative accommodation solutions for a wide variety of industries.

Annabelles NEXT TARGET FOUND!
Demon possessed dolls just dont stay dead like they used to. The Conjuring universe is one of the most successful modern film franchises, and its not quite done with Annabelle just yet.
Audiences learned the origins of the cursed doll in Annabelle: Creation, but now the doll will once again terrorize some poor family in Annabelle 3. The horror film as made its first casting announcement and young up and comer McKenna Grace will play one of the leads and the dolls primary target.
According to Deadline, McKenna Grace has been drafted to star in Annabelle 3. Grace will star as Judy, the young daughter of the Warrens - the paranormal investigators at the center of the Conjuring franchise. Not much is known about the plot at this point, but Judy will become the target of Annabelle, who the Warrens have brought to their artifact room where it can do no harm. But then it does a lot of harm. The film will also follow Judys two babysitters, because nothing bad ever happens to babysitters in horror movies.
Despite her young age, McKenna Grace is on a real career renaissance right now. Shes already starred in Gifted  the Chris Evans movie, I, Tonya, The Bad Seed, and Designated Survivor. Shes got another horror movie on deck with Netflixs The Haunting of Hill House, and soon people will be able to see her in Captain Marvel as a young Carol Danvers.
Annabelle 3 is the sequel of Annabelle: Creation, which itself was a prequel of the first Conjuring movie. That makes the period wherein Annabelle takes place a little tricky, but seeing as how the Warrens are already in possession of the doll, it takes place sometime after The Conjuring but before The Conjuring 2. Theres no word if Vera Farmiga or Patrick Wilson will reprise their roles as the Warrens in Annabelle 3.
Annabelle 3 is currently scheduled to release on July 3, 2019.

Around 750,000 cases pending in Courts
The number of cases pending in courts around the country is as high as 750,000, Justice Minister Thalatha Atukorale said yesterday.
The Minister said the delay in expediting cases may result in litigants losing faith in the countrys judicial system.
Minister Atukorale expressed these views at a ceremony to mark National Mediation Day at Temple Trees held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena. Voicing her disappointment on such a large backlog of cases, the Minister said, it is imperative that proper attention be paid to the matter.
Just as much as we care about the legal profession, we need to take some action to prevent such a large number of cases pending in courts. We cannot be happy about getting cases postponed. People undergo numerous problems due to cases getting postponed.
The Minister pointed out that Community Mediation Boards are doing a great service in preventing a delay in the law. The mediation service has grown into a large tree that shelters the society, she also said. It is important that we make this mediation program popular among school children. Now when an event is organized by a school, it usually ends in a brawl. This is todays situation. So making school children aware of mediation is a productive cause. Minister Atukorale said.
Meanwhile, the Minister also said legal studies will be included to the school curriculum. Accordingly, the curriculum will be designed to expand from grade six to grade 11, she also said.
I am looking forward to raise awareness on law in school children. I wish to include legal studies as a subject in the school curriculum. Accordingly, a basic knowledge in law will be provided to students in Grade Six and Seven. In Grade 9,10 and 11, the students will be taught Civil Law, Criminal Law and the Penal Code, Minister Athukorale said.
The Minister also said that school children must be made aware of drug trafficking and the social issues that arise as a result of it.
Students dont have a clear idea about drug trafficking. Drugs have become a major societal issue at present. Children are not aware of this issue. The Penal Code states that such drug traffickers should be sentenced to death or be sentenced to life imprisonment. It is important that we educate our children about the Penal Code as well, she said.
Minister Athukorale also read out the statement issued by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for the National Mediation Day celebration.
The mediators who are honoured by the President today are a group of volunteers who are committed to building a good and humane society, the statement said.

The artificial intelligence revolution that is coming
Artificial Intelligence (AI), is the ability of computers to perform activities associated with intelligent beings.
A world where computers can think for themselves and be as intelligent as the human being. Would this be a good thing for the world AI, has its benefits and a lot to offer but at the same time it comes with a price.
Forms of Artificial Intelligence
There are three forms of AI. Process automation, cognitive insights and cognitive engagement.
1. Process automation: This is widely beginning to roll out in the manufacturing sector as manufacturing is being automated to save costs and increase efficiency. Supermarkets have started using automation globally for self checkout reducing labor costs and quickening services.
2. Cognitive insights: Using algorithms using a lot of data to predict what the human being can want. This is used by Facebook and Youtube. The Facebook newsfeed and Youtube recommended videos on the side of our screens are according algorithms using AI.
3. Cognitive engagement: This is computer engagement with clients. This is used to offer 24/7 customer service where bots reply to customer queries to a certain extent offering solutions to common questions. Unique or complex questions still need humans to answer but machine learning is increasing by the day.
Benefits of AI technology
Artificial intelligence, no doubt has a lot of positives to offer to us in the coming decades. It can take over the time consuming jobs of humans and do it faster, leading to increased efficiency. Increased automation can allow humans to do creative work leaving the boring time consuming jobs like data entry and replying to emails to the machines.
It can also reduce operational costs which will result in cheaper products to the consumer and also more profits which translates into more corporate taxes. These taxes can be used to provide welfare benefits to the citizens. There is an argument that increased taxes due to less operational costs can bring in universal basic income to the populace. Universal basic income is providing every citizen a minimum amount of money for free with no conditions.
Smart homes using AI can be energy efficient and have better security with automated surveillance around the house. Healthcare is a sector where AI is making inroads. MD Anderson Cancer Centre in 2013 using IBM Watson tried to diagnose and recommend treatment for certain types of cancer but after a few years the project was halted due to high costs. But later they used it for smaller work like recommending hotels and restaurants for patients families and determining which patients needed help with paying bills and it was a success. One of the main criticisms of AI is that it will take away human jobs. In the 1990s, computers were feared as they would take jobs away but it turned out that they did create millions of new jobs from software engineering to computer hardware manufacturing and created massive new tech companies which created immense wealth over the past decades. Similarly, AI can create jobs as well, as research shows that AI related jobs have increased 5 fold in the last 5 years. AI and humans working together can immensely increase efficiency with AI being not prone to human errors.
Dangers of Artificial Intelligence
As robots become more and more intelligent and able to think for themselves, it will become very dangerous if we lose control of them or if they decide they will stop obeying human orders. This is an argument by Teslas Elon Musk. Elon Musk even argues that robots could take over the world. Though it sounds far fetched, it can be a possibility as robots, once they can operate on their own may think humans are a liability to this world with humans consuming a lot of resources in the world.
Though, killer robots make headlines and make good movies in Hollywood, we are already seeing the effects of robot thinking in the world and have already been influenced by it. We already know that Facebooks algorithm based on AI has influenced the voting results leading to Brexit and the election of Donald Trump in the US. Also, when it comes to a fully computerized world, there is always the danger of hacking. If someone gets into the system, a lot of damage can be caused.
Where are we
Currently around 15% of businesses in the US are using AI related technology but this is set to more than double in the coming year showing explosive growth to come in this sector. AI startups have also increased 15 fold since 2000 showing that many new startups in AI are springing up to meet the demand. About 40% of consumers believe AI will improve customer service showing a positive sign from the consumers and showing people do trust AI.
The general perception of artificial intelligence is that it is still in the sci fi movies (Science Fiction Movies) and far off but what people do not realize is that we are living in a time of rapid change and artificial intelligence is taking over more and more of the world. AI spending is set to hit $46 billion by 2020 and this is a very serious business and if countries like Sri Lanka do not take notice they will be left behind.

Foreign investers have removed nearly Rs.10.000 million within a week from the stock market. This shows how the level of trust the investors have in our country, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) President Prof. G.L. Peiris said.
Addressing a press conference of the Joint Opposition Economic unit in Borella, MP Bandula Gunawardena added that in 2019, there will definitely be a great economic collapse, which would be too much for Sri Lanka to endure.
But we are too late to prevent it from happening, he said.
Gunawardena said that the main problem facing Sri Lanka, is that its outflow of foreign exchange is far greater than its inflows which is mainly due to the governments wrong economic management.
If the government is to resolve this crisis, then they must first stop the lies being spread that this crisis is the result of the Rajapaksa regime debts, Gunawardena said.

The Ministry has also decided to establish two zones of peanuts, chillies and mango cultivation in Jaffna and it will commence operations in Ganeshapuram on the October 6.
Although peanuts and black gram are cultivated in Sri Lanka, local production is not sufficient to meet the demand and peanuts and black gram are currently imported from India.
The country spent Rs. 689 million in 2017 for peanut imports.
Many traditional paddy varieties such as Muthu Samba, Manikkam samba, Kurulu Thuda, Suwadel, Kalu Heenati, Ma Vee, Pachchaperumal Rathdel, Madathawalu, Hetada Vee which are rich in nutrients, are on the decline and there is a great demand for rice prepared form these paddy varieties,the Minister said.
Considering the demand, the Ministry will take measures to grow traditional paddy varieties in 550 acres of fallow paddy lands in Vavuniya during the Maha season.

A bouquet to Higher Education Minister
At a time when inhuman ragging in universities has become a national scandal, the Higher Education Minister is attempting to put the house in order. Over the last few decades, the situation deteriorated to such an extent that the learned minister now has a formidable task.
Leaving aside petty politics, cheap popularity and sanctimonious humbugging, it is the duty of the whole nation to support the minister to the hilt.
Any person who derives pleasure by inflicting physical pain on a fellow human being is a sadist - a person with a sick mind.
Such persons must be prevented from roaming the sanctuary of the university premises to torture fellow students.
The complacency and the lackadaisical attitude of university teachers seemed to have exacerbated the problem. Their policy of non-interference may have encouraged the sick minds. Media conferences will not simply absolve the dons. As an octogenarian grandfather of a university student, I earnestly request the learned minister to take a closer look at all institutions of higher education in the country.
Elsewhere in the world universities are the birthplaces of amazing new inventions and theories. Have our universities not failed miserably in this sphere Unfortunately, our university teachers appear to prefer Facebook and Twitter, to the laboratory and the library.
No wonder Sri Lanka has failed to produce one single Nobel Prize winner for the last one hundred years.

Building a road to prosperity in Sri Lanka
Sudath worked as a driver in Doha, Qatar, for nine years, at a monthly salary of LKR 45,000 (US$266.3). Living far away from his hometown, the Sri Lankan man was very hard up. Now, he has a job with the Southern Expressway Extension Project in Sri Lanka and earns LKR 55,000 a month.
Excited about the job keeping him close to his family, as well as the higher income, the 40-year-old man was quite grateful for the project, jointly built by China and Sri Lanka under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative.
My life is getting better and better, he said. Our Chinese friends are building a road to prosperity.
The 96-km extension from Matara to Hambantota consists of four main sections, namely, Section 1 of 30 km from Matara to Belliatta; Section 2 of 26 km from Beliatta to Wetiya; Section 3 of 15 km from Wetiya to Andarawewa, and Section 4 of 25 km from Hambantota to Mattala via Andarawewa.
All four sections are being built by Chinese companies, with China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC), a global top 500 enterprise, responsible for section 2 and 3.
The latter is scheduled to be opened to the public this December, and the former in October 2019, according to Jia Ruihua, deputy general manager of the CSCEC Sri Lanka Branch.
This two-way, four-lane extension will link the western and southern regions of Sri Lanka, and its construction will play a major role in boosting economic and social development along the route and across the southern area, Jia said. After its completion, it will take only two hours from Colombo, the capital, to Hambantota, compared to the present journey of four hours or more.
A bridge of friendship between China and Sri Lanka
It is the common pursuit of Chinese and Sri Lankan constructers here to build the expressway extension into a new benchmark of friendship between the two countries, Jia said.
CSCEC has set up a management team of 60 Chinese and 30 Sri Lankans, and has employed more than 1,100 Sri Lankan workers and 70 Chinese.
It has provided a great many job opportunities for local villagers, hence directly increasing their income and effectively improving their living standards.
In order to improve the skills of local employees, the company even established the first Safety & Vocational Skills Training Center in Sri Lanka and compiled training materials both in English and Sinhala.
Covering an area of about 2,000 square meters, the training center comprises 12 safety experience areas and six vocational training and assessment areas.
Technical workers who pass the final exam will be issued with a certificate, ranked at different levels, according to Zhang Ximin, assistant general manager of the CSCEC Sri Lanka Branch.
That not only brings a salary increase, but improves their skills and competitiveness, and most importantly, helps cultivate professionals for future use in Sri Lanka, Zhang said.
Nalin Manawadu has worked here as a project coordinator for more than two years, largely responsible for communication and coordination among local government departments, villagers and the company.
During an interview in Hambantota, he expressed his gratitude for the Chinese government and praised his Chinese colleagues for listening to the opinions of local villagers and sharing their knowledge and technology.
At the beginning, I had to explain to the people the Belt and Road Initiative.
Later, they realized the ongoing project here brought job opportunities and they would enjoy more convenient transportation in the future. Now they are very happy, Manawadu said.
He was quite proud of attending a training organized by the China Academy for International Business Officials in 2017, saying the rapid development of China left a deep impression on his mind.
A project in harmony with the environment
For the past two and a half years, CSCEC has smoothly carried out the project while putting environmental protection and harmonious development first.
According to Li Peng, project manager for Section 3, the company has collaborated with the Sri Lankan National Building Research Organization and Geological Survey and Mines Bureau to monitor the air, water, noise, vibration and other environmental factors along the route and conduct surveys for possible cracks in houses located within 75 meters from the construction work.
In order to reduce dust during the work, the company allocated two sprinklers for each kilometer along the project and set up 150 dust barriers for local residents.
Hambantota has a dry climate with little rainfall.
In order to solve the problem of farmland irrigation, we have dug more than 90 deep wells for villagers, Li added.
All these activities have been highly appraised by local authorities and organizations. Kandambi, project director of the Road Development Authority of Sri Lanka, spoke highly of the companys performance in safety, environment and quality terms, saying it shows a good image of Chinese enterprises at abroad.

CA dismisses Sinharaja  elephant case
The Court of Appeal has allowed the Centre for Environmental Justice to withdraw a writ petition in which they sought an order directing Wildlife Department not to translocate the Sinharaja elephants.
The petition was consequently dismissed pro forma by Court of Appeal (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara.
The Centre for Environmental Justice and an environmental scientist had filed a writ petition in the Court of Appeal seeking an order directing the Wildlife Minister and the Wildlife Department Director General to formulate a National Policy to protect elephants.
The petitioners further sought an order in the nature of writs of certiorari quashing Wildlife Ministers decision to translocate the pair of elephants remaining in the Sinharaja area.
Petitioners sought an order to formulate a National Policy for protection of elephants, including steps to minimise attacks on human beings, acting under and in terms of the provisions of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance.
Petitioners stated that the Minister and the Director General of Wildlife had decided to translocate the elephants roaming in Sinharaja to a completely different environment such as Horowpothana or a small plot of land near Kalawana without conducting any scientific study thus risking the lives of the elephants.

CCD to use Geobags for coastal protection
The Hydromec International (Pvt) Ltd recently supplied a large quantity of Geobags to the Coast Conservation Department (CCD) to protect Sea Lankan beaches from possible sea erosion.
Geobags which are filled with sand, coal or cement, manufactured with woven geo-textiles, used by countries in order to protect coastal and inland waterways including ponds, dams, tanks and lagoons from erosion and also to create a tourist friendly environment along sea beaches world over. Geobags aremorestable hydraulically and geo technically since the bags are heavier and wider with high proportional ratio.
The bags available in the various sizes and are also used in riverbank, beach protection and offshore breakwater.
A research team of Engineers from the Coast Conservation Department (CCD), after a thorough study of the importance of using geobags for coastal conservation rather than using boulders, recently purchased 750 geobags from Hydromec International, the local agent of Belgium based Bonar NV.
Bonar Nv is a leader in Geotextile productions that are highly used in countries including Belgium, Holland, Germany and USA for coastal protections in coastal belts, sera beaches and river banks. Bonar Nv was introduced to Sri Lanka by Hydromec International (Pvt) Ltd in 1995 and is a regular supplier of Geotextiles to the Coast Conservation Department.
Speaking to Daily News Business, Hydromec International (Pvt) Ltd, Chairman, D. R. P Abeyasinghe said that this is the first time that the Coast Conservation Department has decided to use environmental friendly Geobags at places where sea erosion badly destroy the beaches.
Geobags are suited especially for tourist areas, not only it is environmental friendly but also the colour of geobags blends perfectly with the landscape of sea beaches, he said.
Chairman Abeyasinghe further said that geobags can be produced in different design for different requirements. The materials used for Geo Bag fabrication are polypropylene or polyesterpolyester textile fabric.
It is said that geobagswhich are also called as Geotextile Sand Containers (GSC) could be manufactured at a very low cost.
Geobags are highly used by countries that depend on tourism industry. They are mainly used for coastal protections, especially for beach protections. Geobagand Geotube technology is used to protect shore lines, rebuilt beaches and also to reduce water turbidity or wider beaches with improved sand.
Geobags are manufactured with freely available filtered sand is cost effective against rock transport, handling charges, labour cost etc, he said.

Conserving elephants wins accolades
Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts together with their globally acclaimed ecotourism arm Cinnamon Nature Trails, was recently recognized for their ground-breaking elephant conservation project by the World Travel Market. The Cinnamon Elephant project was shortlisted as Best in Responsible Tourism at the International Travel and Tourism Awards presented by the World Travel Market.
Considered to be among the top 10 greatest natural animal spectacles in the world, the Elephant Gathering is the largest wild gathering of the Asian elephant, occurring annually within the safety of the protected Minneriya and Kaudulla National Parks in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka. The Cinnamon Elephant Project, a collaborative effort initiated in 2014, between Nature Trails and Centre for Conservation and Research with the full funding support from John Keells Foundation. This integrates both long-term conservation efforts of the endangered Asian elephant, and inclusive ecotourism practices in Sri Lanka through elephant viewing based on this annual elephant gathering.
Data gathered from tracking both collared matriarchs will help understand the exact seasonal movement of the elephant herds, and help tackle human-elephant conflicts through better land and water management recommendations. This also facilitates effective, long-term conservation initiatives for Asian elephants. The team successfully completed the first phase of the project in 2017 where over 70 elephants were identified, named and photo-catalogued. Phase two of the project was activated in early 2018 with the collaring of the matriarchs of two elephant herds with support from Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC), which enabled state-of-the-art satellite and GPS tracking of the two herds after the dispersion of the gathering.
International Travel and Tourism Awards consistently looks for examples to inspire and educate others about the contribution which tourism can make to the development of a place since it contributes in a remarkable variety of ways such as through employment and local economic development, providing additional spending power to sustain more restaurants, cafes and entertainment, sustaining cultural and natural heritage, contributing to sense of place and local pride, and encouraging young people to stay in their community and thrive.
We take great pride in the work that we do to promote responsible tourism in Sri Lanka, and the Cinnamon Elephant Project is one that is extremely significant to us due to the critical nature of this sensitive issue and that this would give us a greater opportunity to create more awareness of our efforts and encourage best practices in eco-tourism especially concerning elephants and their habits, stated Head of Nature Trails at Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts Chitral Jayatillake.
The awards will be held in London this November, where the event will celebrate exceptional individuals and businesses within the travel and tourism industry.

Cricket Australia names pay-row negotiator as new boss
Sydney, Wednesday: Cricket Australia (CA) on Wednesday named insider Kevin Roberts -- who spearheaded an ill-fated attempt to slash players' pay last year -- to lead the troubled organisation in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal.
Roberts was appointed chief executive officer and on October 25 will formally replace James Sutherland, who announced in June he was stepping down after 17 years at the helm.
Roberts takes over with CA still under fire over the cheating scandal and smarting from divisions between players and administrators over the bitter pay dispute.
"The game and Cricket Australia have faced some difficult times recently, but we will bounce back," the 46-year-old said.
Sutherland won plaudits during his long tenure for negotiating a lucrative new television rights deal and popularising the Big Bash League, day-night Tests and women's cricket.
But he faced a career-ending crisis in March when former captain Steve Smith, his deputy David Warner and batsman Cameron Bancroft attempted to alter the ball in the third Test in South Africa.
They were all sent home in disgrace and handed lengthy bans, with then-coach Darren Lehmann resigning and Sutherland eventually choosing to walk after coming under sustained pressure.
His replacement Roberts is a former opening batsman for New South Wales who moved into business when his cricketing career failed to take off.
He worked for a range of sporting companies including adidas, 2XU and Canterbury before joining Cricket Australia in 2012, first as a board director, then as part of the executive management team.
Roberts was lead negotiator for Cricket Australia in last year's pay row, when the organisation was accused of using hardball negotiating tactics in a bid to cap remuneration costs.
The brinksmanship saw top players left off contract for a month and resulted in the cancellation of an Australia A tour to South Africa before CA eventually backed down.
The dispute cemented a view within the game that Roberts is the favoured protege of CA chairman David Peever, a polarising figure with a reputation for union busting in his former life as a mining executive.
The promotion of an internal candidate to replace Sutherland will also raise questions about CA's commitment to changing the organisation's culture in the wake of the ball-tampering affair.
The cheating scandal rocked Australian cricket to its core, undermining the long-held notion that its players were "tough but fair".
Critics blamed a win-at-all-costs mentality that they said developed under Sutherland and his management team, including Roberts.
CA denied the charge but set up two separate inquiries to examine how the scandal occurred, one looking at player behaviour and the other examining the team's culture.
Neither report has yet been released but CA has chosen to appoint one of its own to the top job.
Peever said the chief executive's role was so complex that it made sense to promote from within.
The Australian Cricketers' Association, the players' union which locked horns with Roberts last year, wished Roberts well and said he needed to help cricket "reconnect" with disillusioned fans.
Roberts also sounded a conciliatory note, saying he wanted to improve relations with the players' body.
"There will be bumps in the road for cricket along the way, no question, we are all human and we will experience some challenges along the way," he told reporters.
"But (we will) work on really sincerely, genuinely building that relationship with the ACA." AFP

Croatia court rejects Modric perjury charges: report
Zagreb, Tuesday: A Zagreb court has rejected charges that Croatia captain and Real Madrid star Luka Modric gave false testimony in a corruption trial, a Croatian newspaper reported on Tuesday.
The decision, which can be appealed, came just a week after Modric was crowned FIFAs best player of the year, after starring for both his club and Croatia.
Croatian prosecutors charged Modric in March with committing perjury during evidence he gave in the multi-million-euro corruption trial of former Dinamo Zagreb boss Zdravko Mamic.
Modric, 33, testified in June last year over the details of his 2008 transfer from Dinamo to Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur.
He went on to join Real Madrid in 2012.
The offence carries a maximum penalty of up to five years in jail. But, the Zagreb municipal court decided not to confirm the indictment -- a step required by Croatian law for a trial to open -- according to an online report in the Vecernji List daily quoting the tribunal. The report could not be immediately confirmed with the court.
Vecernji List said the court ruled that the indictment was premature, meaning it should have not been brought before rulings in the trial against Mamic become final.
Mamic and three other defendants were found guilty of charges of abuse of power and corruption that cost Dinamo, the current Croatian champions, more than 15 million euros ($17.3 million), and the state 1.5 million euros.
Mamic, who is currently in hiding in neighbouring Bosnia, was sentenced in June to six and a half years in jail.
Prosecutors allege cash was embezzled through fictitious deals related to player transfers.
Liverppool defender Dejan Lovren, who also testified at the Mamic trial about his 2010 transfer from Dinamo to French side Lyon, also faces perjury charges. AFP

## Title: CURRENCY TENSIONS AND CONTAGION
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, October 4, 2018 - 01:00
CURRENCY TENSIONS AND CONTAGION

Roots of currencytensions to currency crises
How a significant currency tension will end up in a currency crisis is well-known. We must understand that currency tensions in modern global economies appear as an early warning of long-prevailing economic or financial imbalances or unhealthy concentrations/excesses or dark corners which are macroeconomic risks whose real background and the magnitude are not adequately known which may be about to burst. Sudden currency tensions are one of triggers to such bursts.
There can be various developments/causes that lead such early warnings to emerge suddenly. In present currency tensions, the continuous increase in the US interest rates with the rising value of the US dollar is the prime cause. In the case of foreign currency sector, the excessive dependence of the economy on foreign exchange is the underlying risky concentration/excess. The excessive dependence means the protracted deficits between foreign receipts and foreign payments that are funded by governments foreign borrowings. When the foreign deficit is funded by the roll-over of short-term foreign borrowing, the risk of a possible burst of the borrowing/funding is the worst.
The possible burst will have various roots. First is the borrowing by banks and financial institutions. This includes borrowing in foreign currency as well as in local currency from foreign sources/customers. In addition to direct borrowings, there are various borrowing products such as foreign currency swaps, deposits, re-purchase agreements and payment commitments such as forward contracts, credit lines and various foreign guarantees. In the case of longer-term borrowing, there may be some borrowing that are due to mature soon. Although banks and finance companies are subject to maximum limits of foreign currency borrowing, they will have various borrowing products innovatively created to circumvent the limits, inclusive of additional borrowings with the approval of the Central Bank on various ad-hoc reasons. Accordingly, nobody really knows the true extent of the exposure of banks and financial institutions to foreign funding sources and underlying cash flow mismatches between foreign currency and local currency. In addition, majority of such foreign funds usually have been invested and lent for longer-term basis.
Accordingly, such foreign borrowings have exposed banks and financial institutions to risks of currency mismatches (between foreign currency and local currency) and maturity mismatches (short-term liabilities and longer-term assets) in addition to risk of roll-over of funds. In general, in currency tensions and crises, foreign lenders and investors do not renew their funds and take them back. In that event, banks and financial institutions will run out of funds to repay and come to local money market for borrowing. In general, this stage of the contagion will cause a liquidity crunch in the money market as surplus banks will cut-down lending naturally for their safety due to emerging tensions in the market. Also, they become unable to continue lending to businesses as usual and, therefore, businesses start defaulting of existing loans due to business cash flow problems.
As a result, banks, financial institutions and businesses get into spiral of finding shortages. In addition, a general exchange control permission has been available for the local companies to borrow from foreign sources. Nobody has the information on details of such borrowing. Generally, foreigners do not lend long-term to private businesses of local origin.
Therefore, the possible non-rollover of such private foreign borrowing could cause new demand for foreign currency to repay loans and new demand for local bank loans to finance businesses and cash flows of these companies. As a result, local companies get into funding problems which will add to shortages of funding or liquidity crunch in the economy.
In general monetary economics, any liquidity crunch, if it persists, leads to a credit crunch in the economy. As all major economic activities are financed by credit, the credit crunch immediately leads to an economic and business crunch. The credit crunch also will result in increase in interest rates and recession in the economy causing a wide range of business bankruptcies, loss of production and employment. It is highly possible that banks and financial institutions are highly exposed to market funds and, therefore, their cash flow deficits can cause a loss of public trust in some weak banks and financial institutions which will end up in a banking crisis and cripple the economy in no time. This is the catastrophe that countries will face due to currency crises. There are enough real-world experiences.
No need to mention about funding difficulties that the government will confront as the government is financed by new borrowings as well as the roll-over of existing borrowings in both local currency and foreign currency.
As the government is the regular borrowers in large volumes in the market, the increase in interest rates due to the shortage of liquidity in the market will first appear in the government debt market and all others will follow it.
The inflation caused by the currency depreciation also will push up market interest rates further to protect the real value of funds. As seen in many countries in the recent past, nobody can preclude possible public bankruptcies too at times. No intellectual macroprudential/financial stability surveillance frameworks of central banks in the world have been able to detect early such financial contagions and catastrophes in the past although it was their duty.
Responsibility of the CentralBank and its recent policy stance
In terms of the provisions of the Monetary Law Act, Foreign Exchange Act and other statutes relating to regulation of banks and financial institutions, prevention and resolution of present currency tensions and possible currency/financial crisis are the responsibilities of the Central Bank. The Minister of Finance also has responsibilities if the policy actions of the Central Bank are not adequate. The Central Bank has to use a mix of immediate policies without waiting for any further early warnings as the whole country and the world are now talking widely about currency tensions in the emerging market economies. Tensions will not end up soon as the US monetary policy tightening by way of increase in interest rates from the current 2.25% to around 3-3.5% and absorbing of nearly one trillion US dollars from the market, despite the strong opposite views of the President Donald Trump and his economic team, are expected in next two years in line with the mandate of the US Fed to keep inflation at around present 2% target with so-called normal/long-term level of interest rates. Meantime, the Europe also plans to commence tightening its monetary policy in 2019 as the economic recovery of the region from the same global financial crisis 2007/09 appears to be strong where some of foreign investments would flow to the Europe from emerging market economies.
The transmission and multiplier effect of this aggressively tightened monetary policy on the emerging market economies would be adverse as the US dollar is the leading global reserve currency. The US Fed states that, although it considers spillover effects to other countries, the US Fed is the central bank to the US and implements policies in the direct interests of the US.
However, the Central Bank still has not publicly recognized the currency problem although it could wee bean early warning of the macroeconomic risk of the prevailing exposures to foreign currency where many other countries have commenced standard monetary and regulatory policies since May to counter spreading of present currency tensions.
Instead, the Central Bank has made irresponsible statements to the public. First, in the middle of the beginning of currency tensions, the Central Bank cut interest rates (standing lending facility rate) by 0.25% in April after communicating in March (one month before) that there was no macroeconomic rationale for any expectation of increase in interest rates in the economy in near future (despite the fact that US Fed had been raising interest rates aggressively).
Second, in May, the Central Bank issued a press release stating that the foreign reserve of the country would increase to US$ 11 bn by mid-June from the level of prevailing US$ 9 bn and a part of its unprecedentedly large foreign reserve could be used to trigger even a material appreciation of the rupee to prevent unwarranted depreciation of the currency, particularly as the depreciation is not justified by the underlying fundamentals.

EDB organizes Technical Training Program in Malaysia
The EDB with the assistance of Sri Lanka High Commission in Malaysia organized a Technical Training Program for the latex rubber product sectors at the Academy of Hevea Malaysia of Malaysian Rubber Board recently, for twelve technical representatives of leading companies engaged in manufacturing and exporting latex rubber products.
The objectives of this technical training Program were to understand the global challenges and trends in the latex based products industry and bridge the gaps to be competitive, to acquire theoretical and practical experience in the use of latex materials and product testing using advanced equipments and initiate interest in research and development of rubber technology and its applications.
The companies that participated at the program were Lak Methodic Co.(Pvt) Ltd, Latex Green (Pvt) Ltd, Richard Pieris Natural Foams Limited, Textrip (Pvt) Ltd, Westbury International (Pvt) Limited, Ansell Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, Midas Safety (Prime Polymer Division), Lak Latex Centrifuge (Pvt) Ltd, Lalan Eco Latex (Pvt) Ltd, Hanwella Rubber Products Ltd, Dipped Products PLC, DPL Premier Gloves Ltd.
The participants were able to learn latex technology, Nano Material applications for latex products, specialty lattices, health related issues, rubber latex thread and draft for polymerization, waste management for latex processing and products manufacturing, latex paints and adhesive, synthetic latex, foam manufacturing and lab visits.
The Academy Hevea Malaysia (AHM), established in 2006 as a research centre of Malaysian Rubber Board is committed to provide industry oriented skills training, expedite technology transfer through technical training and producing adequate skilled manpower for the rubber industry. Malaysia today ranks as one of the largest producers of natural rubber in the world.
The latex products sector is the largest sub-sector within Malaysias rubber industry and comprises of 125 manufacturers producing gloves, catheters, latex thread and others which accounts for 81% of the total value of rubber exports. Malaysia continued to maintain its position as the worlds leading producer and exporter of catheters, latex threads and natural rubber medical gloves.
The Rubber products sector is the 4th largest export earning sector and has established a reputation for quality and reliability. This industry is known to be a technology intensive industry and requires trained skilled personnel who have the experience on modern machinery and equipments, mature processing technology and high level of product development to keep in line with the global market trends such as growing importance of sustainability concepts and cost effective production processes.
The rubber manufacturing sector in Sri Lanka can be classified mainly into two sectors; latex based and dry rubber based products. Tyres of various varieties comprise the majority of dry rubber based products exported from Sri Lanka. Other products include fenders, shoe soles and industrial rubber goods. Domestic, industrial, household and medical gloves are the main latex products exported. Sri Lanka caters to over 7% of the global demand for medical gloves including sterile surgical and dental gloves designed for specific functions. Other latex products are balloons, rubber bands, mattresses & pillows, rubber threads, toys, etc. Export of latex based rubber products in 2016 was US$ 177 mn and it has increased to US$ 199 mn in 2017 by 12.5%. The main export markets are USA, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Canada, UK, and Brazil.
In order to sustain and grow in the international market, the industry has to constantly upgrade the production processes, adapt and improve products, invest in R&D, innovation, comply with standards and required certifications, new elastomeric and polymer technology, laboratory testing available in the world .
EDB with the assistance of Sri Lanka High Commission in UK also organized a successful Technical Training and Exposure Program for representatives of rubber products manufacturing companies at Tun Abdul Razake Research Centre (TARRC), which is the UK based research and promotion centre of the Malaysian Rubber Board in 2017.
The representatives who participated were able to gain knowledge and exposure on advanced technology, proper testing methods, international standards, operational methods etc. related to manufacturing of dry rubber products.

EPF to re-enter stock market
The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) will re-enter the Stock Market under strict guidelines and a cautious investment strategy, Central Bank Governor Dr Indrajith Coomaraswamy said.
The Governor, speaking at a press conference at the CB auditorium on Tuesday, said the EPF would be permitted to trade only in Monetary Board approved list of shares. He said that the list is now being finalised with the help of the Colombo Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
He said investment and trading guidelines for the EPF have now been agreed to make sure that necessary safeguards and checks and balances are in place with regard to the Rs 2 trillion-Fund.
There is a lot of preparation for the EPFs re-entry into the Stock Market. An investment committee chaired by a Deputy Governor, which meets every day, will decide on the EPF investments. The decisions will be taken collectively. CCTV and voice recording devices will be installed and special training will be given to the officers, the Governor explained.
Since there had been some resistance from Trade Unions, we hope to call a meeting with the Trade Unions Advisory Committee in a couple of weeks.We will make a presentation to them on the new measures to be taken when trading EPF money in the stock market, the Governor added. He said once all these steps are completed, the Monetary Board would decide the date as to when the EPF would come back to the Stock Market. He said the percentage of the Fund traded in the Stock Market would not exceed 5 percent.
He pointed out that if the Government maintains the fiscal discipline, the domestic borrowing requirement of the Government would lessen gradually and therefore the EPF would have to find new avenues for investment other than the Government Securities.
The peak of the domestic debt repayment comes this year and that amount is Rs 980 billion. Next year it drops down to Rs 600 billion and it further drops the year after.The EPF will have to look for other avenues, but certainly those have to be conservative investment, he added.
Asked by journalists as to why not the EPF pulls out of its arbitrary investments, which have given no return as revealed in the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on Sri Lankan and Mihin Airlines, the Governor said now is not the best time to do so as the stock market is operating at low rate. We need to wait till the Stock Market regains. This is a buying opportunity, not a selling opportunity, he added.

Exxon Mobil eyes multi-billion dollar investment at Singapore refinery
Exxon Mobil Corp is considering a multi-billion dollar investment at its Singapore refinery, the companys largest, ahead of new global shipping fuel regulations starting in 2020, a senior executive said on Wednesday (Oct 3).
We are currently assessing a multi-billion project in our integrated manufacturing facility here in Singapore, Matt Bergeron, vice president of Asia Pacific Fuels Business at Exxon, said at a bunkering conference.
Should the project proceed, we plan to implement proprietary technologies that will convert lower value by-products into cleaner higher value products including 0.5 per cent sulphur fuels that we believe will be the compliant option for the vast majority of the marine sector, Bergeron said.
The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is introducing new rules on marine fuels from 2020, limiting the sulphur content to 0.5 per cent, from 3.5 per cent currently, to curb pollution produced by the worlds ships.
The shipping and oil refining industries are scrambling to prepare for the shift and have made large investments to comply with the new standards since they were announced in 2016.
Exxons Singapore refinery is the companys largest, with a capacity of about 592,000 barrels a day. Singapore is also home to the oil giants biggest integrated petrochemical complex.
We have already made significant investments at a number of other refineries around the world in order to increase our production capacity of cleaner fuels with lower sulphur content, Bergeron said.
Exxon in September announced it was planning to spend more than US$650 million to upgrade the UKs largest oil refinery, Fawley, on Englands south coast. Channel NewsAsia

Fear of  Rupee  depreciation
The steady depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee appears to be the latest obstacle confronting the government, as it seeks to exert a semblance of control over rising prices with the prospect of national elections looming in less than two years.
At beginning of this week, the United States dollar stood at 167 rupees with no indications that the rupee will appreciate in the foreseeable future. This provides a fertile ground for the opposition to berate the government and, as public discontent with the soaring cost of living grows, those in the corridors of power are concerned that there would be political repercussions.
Of course, apolitical observers agree that the entire blame for the current crisis cannot rest with the government. It is a culmination of global economic factors, compounded by the drastic trade policies adopted by the United States government that has led to the current predicament. As such, it cannot be easily undone by a country such as Sri Lanka whose economy is dwarfed by its global competitors.
The United States, led by its temperamental President Donald Trump, is engaged in a trade war with China. At the same time, it is also insisting on imposing sanctions on Iran, a major oil exporter. It has also re-negotiated its North American trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. All these actions, though not directly impacting on Sri Lanka have led to a steady appreciation of the US Dollar, with resultant consequences for the import oriented Sri Lankan economy.
Pricing formula
For instance, the government has been compelled to increase fuel prices on a regular basis now. This is done based on a pricing formula. While this may be a necessity, it has also attracted much criticism in a country where the public has been used to stable fuel prices for decades.
Similarly, the price of railway fares and gas has also increased, with a 12.5 kilogram gas cylinder increasing by 195 rupees. Railway fares were also raised by 15 per cent, the increase being the first since 2008. The authorities did attempt to sugar coat the hike by keeping the minimum price of a ticket unchanged at 10 rupees.
In what it said was a bid to stabilise the rupee, the government has also announced that it would be curtailing vehicle imports, stating it was suspending the issuing of vehicles permits to parliamentarians for a period of one year. Importation of vehicles for ministries, departments, statutory boards and state owned enterprises will also be suspended until further notice.
Importation of vehicle using the concessionary permits issued to state sector employees will be suspended for six months. No Letters of Credits (LCs) will be permitted to be opened based on these permits during this period, the Finance Ministry said.
However, this move has earned the ridicule of some sections of the public who point out that the vast majority of parliamentarians have already used the permits they were entitled to, to import vehicles and then sell them to others at massive profits. Social media was awash with lists of such parliamentarians and the names of the new owners of the vehicles they had imported.
Opposition politicians have been quick to criticise the governments handling of the issue. The Joint Opposition (JO)s de facto economic spokesman, Bandula Gunawardena claimed this week that the government was releasing funds to the local market in a desperate bid to stabilise the rupee.
Infrastructuredevelopment projects
The Central Bank has released US$157.7 million to the market within four days, Gunawardena claimed. When the International Monetary Fund is releasing US$169 million to Sri Lanka as loans, he claimed that the release of US$157.5 million to stabilise the rupee would only result in a further increase in the cost of living.
The leader of the JO and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has weighed into the debate, countering accusations that his government was responsible for snaring the country in an enormous debt trap through massive borrowings it obtained for its infrastructure development projects, most of which are not yielding dividends and are a financial burden on the country. Rajapaksa argues that the government should get its act together instead of blaming the United States and President Trump for its woes.
Rajapaksa said in a statement that the role of a government was to keep abreast of worldwide developments instead of complaining that a foreign leader has strengthened his own economy and that our currency was collapsing on that account. If we have a government that requires foreign countries to underperform so as to enable us to maintain the value of our currency, then this country is in deep trouble, Rajapaksa said.
Anura Kumara Dissanayake, leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) called on the government to take short term measures to stabilise the rupee. The rupee has deprecated by 7.3 per cent against the Euro, 10 per cent against the Yen, 2 per cent against the Australian dollar, 4 percent against the Singapore dollar, 4 per cent against the Chinese Yuan, 8 per cent against the Bangladesh Taka and 7 per cent against the British Pound. This is a clear reflection on the governments disastrous economic policies, he said.
State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Dr. Harsha de Silva, an economist by profession, has offered a more balanced view. Dr de Silva identifies the lack of exports as the major factor in the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee.
Dr. de Silva describes the government decision to introduce the fuel pricing formula as brave and commends the Central Bank for being responsible and not burning reserves to defend the rupee at levels that are not feasible. He recalls how in 2011 and 2012, the Central Bank artificially maintained the Dollar at 110 rupees for several months losing almost 4 billion US dollars or close to half of the reserves in just a few months and yet, the rupee depreciated by about 13 percent thereafter.
What we see today is clearly and absolutely the outcome of that purely short-term populist economic policy of ten plus years. I shudder to think what could happen if God forbid those who continue to advocate inward looking policies grab power, Dr. de Silva said on social media. He predicts that the rupee will stabilise in the coming weeks. The rupee will find its equilibrium once the dust settles. Some appreciation of the currency is warranted, he said.
Global influences
Echoing Dr. de Silvas comments, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe also argues for strengthening of the countrys exports, to cushion its economy from global influences. Countries such as Thailand and Vietnam are not severely affected by the global economy as they fully depend on exports, the Prime Minister noted.
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera has also urged the public not to panic. Addressing students at Royal College, Colombo he argued that the depreciation of the rupee is not the end of the world. Minister Samaraweera noted that the previous government released Rs.4.1 billion into the market to control depreciation but it still depreciated by 14 per cent.
Pumping money into the market is not the solution. We should somehow manage savings and prevent unnecessary spending. The economy is not going to crash. In a way this is a good opportunity for us to make Sri Lanka an export-oriented economy, Minister Samaraweera said. The situation will get better, but I cant tell when it would be, he declared.
While it is clear that the depreciation of the rupee is having a pervasive negative impact on prices and public sentiment regarding the government, it is also not a crisis that warrants short term, quick fix solutions. The trick for the government though is titrating pragmatic economic policies with widespread concerns about rising prices. If it fails in this balancing act, there will almost certainly be a backlash from the voter, a repercussion the opposition wont hesitate to exploit.

Fighting nameless, shapeless fears

With the advancement of civilization, science and technology, problems of ageing too seem to have developed! One of the dreaded problems is Alzheimers disease (AD). Ageing is an unstoppable journey leading to second childhood and eventually infancy. AD has expedited this process for some. But we have on medical advice that with proper health care, timely observation and preventive measures the aged can be less of a burden to family and society with onset of AD.
Forgetfulness in old age is common to all humanity. But with AD it is a sickness. The name has its derivation from Dr. Alois Alzheimer, a German doctor who in 1906, noticed changes in the brain tissue of a woman who had died of an unusual mental illness. The rest is medical jargon that can be safely left to the world of medicine.
Stating broadly, AD is a frightening and debilitating illness that is characterized by confusion, memory failure, disorientation, restlessness, amnesia, speech disturbances, inability to carry out purposeful movements, and hallucinations (Mosbys Medical, Nursing and Allied Heath Dictionary)
symptoms
The symptoms can best be exemplified with an excerpt from The 36-Hour Day, a book for families and caregivers of people with (AD).
Often, Mary was afraid, a nameless, shapeless fear. Her impaired mind could not put a name or an explanation to her fear. People came, memories came, and then they slipped away. She could not tell what was real and what was not. The bathroom was not where it was yesterday. Dressing became an insurmountable ordeal....Mary gradually lost the ability to make sense out of what her eyes and ears told her....She worried about her things: a chair, and the china that had belonged to her mother. They said they had told her over and over, but she could not remember where her things had gone. Perhaps someone had stolen them. She had lost so much.... Mary was glad when her family came to visit. Sometimes she remembered their names; more often she did not. She never remembered that they had come last week, so she regularly scolded them for abandoning her....She was glad when they didnt try to remind her of what she had just said or that they had come last week, or ask her if she remembered this person or that one. She liked it best when they just held her and loved her
Although the risk of it developing increases with age, in most people symptoms first appear after age 60 and it is found that AD rapidly increases between the ages 65 and 85. Medical science is still in the quest of finding its causes. That AD is not a part of normal aging is concluded with the knowledge that, in the absence of disease, the human brain often can function well into the tenth decade of life says medical researchers.
Various terms
People today are often puzzled about various terms used in the field of forgetfulness. Dementia is a term used to describe a range of illnesses that affect a persons ability to think, to reason and to remember. Although AD is the most common form of dementia that can effect elders, it can also effect people in their forties or even younger. The term amnesia has been medically defined as the inability to recall an event which has ended, and the patient thereafter returning to normal self and is said to be common among those who are tensed, anxious and trying to have too many irons in the fire, whatever be the age.
By taking treatment it is researched that although AD cannot be cured, at least it can be slowed down. In the question of life of an AD patient, it may be asked whether it is mere existence, with total custodian care, or with early detection and preventive treatment a patients quality of life is sustained to make it easier for the patient and the caregivers who are hard to find in this busy world of hectic activity!
It has been researched that AD is probably, the only illness that can truly be described as being the opposite of birth.
Brain begins shrinking as the disease progresses, and the layers of learning are stripped away in much the same order in which they were laid on from birth. At death, the brain resembles that of a newborn infant. This implies that family members and care givers have to be mindful that up to the point of reaching this stage, the patient responds to love, touch emotion and the care givers sympathetic understanding similar to the responses of a new born infant!
With the onset of age should we not be alert to keep our minds occupied to ensure there are no mental and physical atrophies that may trigger such diseases as AD Should not the family members also make discreet observations for their own sake as well as for the sake of their dear ones
Caregivers
It is said that caring for an AD patient at home can be very demanding both physically and emotionally - it can make one feel lonely. Each day brings new challenges as the caregiver copes with changing levels of ability and new patterns of behavior. Much compassion, will power, adjustments and adaptations may be necessary in the long run. It implies caring for the patients general health, keeping an eye on his/her daily activities, avoiding risk of injuries, preventing infections, drug and recreation management and doing all this with much love and care. As the disease gets worse and caring at home becomes increasingly difficult, family members will face difficult decisions about long-term care.
Research has found that the worst that can happen to an AD patient is to be put away from the home environment. With no love and attention the disease could be worsened. But on pragmatic terms in a poor country such as ours, family caregivers will be hard to find as they will not be able to cope with the attention needed, and at the same time be gainfully employed and tend to their own families. These are matters that our civil society will have to deal with in addition to providing homes for the aged and other elderly care.
Would it surprise readers to know that a caregiver must first cultivate loving oneself before being capable of loving and caring for another person, according to a book on instructions to care givers Does it connote self-esteem Does it also not echo the Second Commandment given to Moses several millennia ago To Love thy neighbor as thyself.

Fitch assigns Melstacorp First-Time AAA(lka) rating; Outlook Stable
Fitch Ratings has assigned Sri Lanka-based conglomerate Melstacorp PLC a National Long-Term Rating of AAA(lka). The outlook is stable.
Melstacorps rating reflects the groups strong credit profile, underpinned by its entrenched market position in Sri Lankas alcoholic-beverage sector and the high entry barriers, which drive its strong operating cash flows and low leverage, and offset the weaknesses in its other, less operationally significant, investments. Melstacorps rating also factors in its controlling stake in Sri Lanka-based conglomerate Aitken Spence PLC (ASP), which has leading market positions in leisure, logistics and power generation. We proportionately consolidate ASPs financials with that of Melstacorp in arriving at the rating to reflect our view that Melstacorps access to ASPs cash balances and future cash flows will be limited to its effective ownership of 51%.
We also believe that Melstacorp will only likely provide its proportionate share of support to ASP, if required, due to the subsidiarys large public ownership.
Leading Alcoholic-Beverage Maker: Melstacorps 92.5%-owned subsidiary, Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka (DIST: AAA(lka)/Stable), accounts for over 60% of Sri Lankas spirits production and has been able to maintain its market leadership due to its entrenched DCSL brand and access to a country-wide distribution network. The complete advertising ban on alcoholic beverages acts as a high entry barrier and further strengthens DISTs dominance. However, spirits makers volumes are likely to drop after the government revised excise duties to tax the manufacturers at higher rates than beer and wine makers from November 2017.

Five Jaffna University students file FR  claiming religious rights


Five students including four Sinhala Buddhists and a Tamil Hindu of the Jaffna University yesterday filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court complaining that the university administration infringed their fundamental rights to conduct their religious observances within the campus premises.
The students who are attached to the Business Studies Faculty at the Vavuniya campus of the Jaffna University complain in the petition that the university administration is continuously harassing, victimising and penalising them by keeping them indefinitely out of bounds of the Vavuniya campus, for their suspected involvement in bringing a Budu Kutiya (wooden structure for the placement of a Buddha statue) to the Vavuniya campus.
The petitioners cited Jaffna University Vice Chancellor Prof. Ratnam Vigneswaran, Dr. T. Mangaleswaran, P. Priyadarshan and six others including the Higher Education Minister as respondents.
The petitioners stated that to celebrate the Vesak Poya which fell on April 29, they brought a Buddha statue and placed it in the Budu Kutiya. They alleged that the third respondent, a sub-warden asked them to remove it from the campus premises.
The petitioners further alleged that the university administration prevented them from pursuing their university education and sitting for the examination, subjecting them to excessive punishment not warranted by disciplinary procedure, by not granting any hearing to their appeals and by not releasing the Board of Inquiry Report and by not informing them of the decision of the Board of Inquiry.
The petitioners stated that freedom of thought, conscience and religion is the most important fundamental right of every person.
They further alleged that the respondents have infringed the fundamental rights of the petitioners to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution when they were penalised for expressing their views asserting their fundamental rights to conduct their religious observances within the campus premises.
This petition was filed through senior counsel Kalyananda Thiranagama and counsel Nilmal Wickremasinghe.

Football in Kandy in the doldrums
Why is football in Kandy at club level nowhere on the field This is the question on every football fans lips. There are plans, by some keen football lovers to score and help football regain its former glory when Kandy produced top class players who went on to sport national colors. If this is to happen then it is essential that a new set of competent promoters should serve in the committee.
Today football in Kandy is in the doldrums, from 1988 to 2001 the sport flourished, but sad to say, the sport is now at a low ebb. In the last two years no AGM or tournaments have been held.
If not for some schools games, there is hardly any football. Kandy today is finding it difficult to keep the game alive at club level. Football at club level is breathing its last or is almost dead.
The talent is there and the administrators should organize tournaments. There are people who come from Colombo and Gampola before an AGM and have closed door meetings and finally mess it up.
The Kandy Association Football League is nearly 95 years old and some of the football lovers who served as officials and players have planned to celebrate the occasion.
Though football has been played for over 150 years in Kandy, the KAFL was formed in 1925, and Kandy is one of the founder members of the football governing body.
A look back into Kandy football reveals that the sport in Kandy had its origins in the mid-1920s. This was during the 2nd World War when the British Units were stationed in Kandy. Onetime Commander in Chief of Allied Forces in South East Asia, Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten had his headquarters in the hill capital and saw to the growth of the game.
At one time the Kandy League was only second to the Colombo League team wise, with over 40 teams participating in three groups A, B and C. Today, even the people who are involved in Kandy football are ignorant as to when football started in Kandy. Sad to say there are not even ten clubs in action, no tournaments at domestic level are being played.
From the early years of barefoot competitions to the present age of sophisticated football, Kandy has played a vital role in its growth, but today football is not on a good footing.
A few years back FFSL, made a big show in Kandy, saying Kandy will get a modern football stadium at Dangolla, through FIFA and the foundation stone was laid in 2013. Its now over five years nothing has happened only the stone remains which is a sad indictment on those who govern the game. Football is in the doldrums in Kandy mainly due to the alleged mismanagement of FFSL over the years. A few years back, the controlling bodys president of that time messed up Kandy football. In a surprise move the hard working committee was dissolved and a new committee was appointed, that was the start of the slide.
From that day, they have failed to complete a single tournament in a proper manner. An English football coach who visited Kandy, after watching rugby recently said that when he was here some years ago, football was the most popular sport in Kandy. But today rugby is more popular.
Kandy won the All Island senior and junior league championship for the first time under the presidency of B.M. Liyanage and H. Marikar. With this win Kandy toured Nepal, the first time a team went overseas. What the controlling body should do is to appoint an interim committee and run football in Kandy until it is properly organized. They should obtain the support of those who have done great service to this game in the past. In the good old days, the winners of the league and the knockouts were presented with Rs. 150,000 cash award.
In the FFSLs competition, it is sad to say that no team from Kandy is participating. Holding office for prestige sake is not what is required now.
People must come forward and serve football. Most officials holding office are only keen on coaching and refereeing for financial benefits.
If football in Kandy is to improve the controlling body must put the leagues on the correct path.

Four arrested over  Hollywood heists
US: Four people have been arrested for allegedly burglarizing the homes of celebrities including singer Rihanna and baseball star Yasiel Puig, Los Angeles police announced Tuesday.
Authorities said they believe the suspects are part of a larger ring that specializes in breaking into the homes of athletes, actors and Hollywood film producers for theft.
The home of basketball star LeBron James appeared on a list of dwelling that was seized by police and appeared to name future targets for robbery. The homes of actors Viola Davis and Matt Damon were also on the list.
The suspects are three teens, two aged 19 and one 18, and the 34-year-old mother of one of them.
During recent months, the Los Angeles Police Department has become aware of a series of residential burglaries targeting actors, producers, musicians and professional athletes living in the Los Angeles area, Lillian Carranza, head of the LAPD commercial crimes division, told a news conference.
The victims homes had been selected based on social media postings and touring or travel schedules of the owners. The burglars believed no one would be home and that the homes would contain sought-after valuables that they might be interested in, she added.
Police who made the arrests seized purses and wallets, watches, jewelry and a gun.
Over the past two years the homes of celebrities such as Alanis Morissette, Nicki Minaj and Emmy Rossum have also been burglarized. - AFP

HEALTHY LUNCH BOX
What to put for healthy school lunches
Try planning a healthy lunch box. Talk to your children and discuss what they would be happy to take to school.
The six key parts to a healthy lunchbox
include:
*Fresh fruit
*Fresh crunchy vegetables
*Milk, yoghurt or cheese. For children who cannot tolerate milk products, offer appropriate alternatives like calcium fortified soy or rice drink or soy yoghurt
*A meat or meat alternative food like some lean meat (e.g. chicken strips), hard-boiled egg or peanut butter.
*A grain or cereal food like bread, a roll, flat bread, fruit bread or crackers (wholegrain or whole meal choices are best)
*Water

Tips for healthy lunchboxes include:

Cut up large pieces of fruit and put them in a container  this makes it easier to eat, especially if your child has wobbly teeth or if they have less time to eat than they are used to.
Consider giving half a sandwich or roll for morning recess, as this is an easy way to get a healthy fill.
In the hot weather, send frozen milk, yoghurt or water, or even frozen orange segments. This makes a great refreshing snack and helps to keep the lunch box cool.
Go for colour and crunch in the lunch box by offering a variety of colourful vegetables and fruit.

What not to put in healthier school lunches

Some items do not belong in a healthy school lunchbox. Six items to avoid when preparing lunch for your children include:
All sweet drinks such as fruit juices, fruit drinks, cordials, energy drinks, flavoured waters, flavoured mineral waters, iced teas and soft drinks. These are high in energy (kilojoules) and sugar, and can lead to weight gain and oral health problems in children
Dried fruit bars and straps. These are low in fibre and are also high in sugar and can stick to childrens teeth, causing tooth decay
Dairy desserts, chocolate bars and muesli bars. These are generally high in fat and sugar
Chocolate spreads, jams and honey in sandwiches. These add extra, unnecessary sugar to the lunchbox
Fatty, salty processed meats oven-baked savoury biscuits. These may sound like healthier options, but some are just as high in salt and fat as crisps.

Artificially sweetened drinks
Artificially sweetened drinks do not add extra kilojoules (energy) or sugar to the lunchbox, but still encourage sweet preference and promote the habit of drinking sweet drinks in children. Artificially sweetened soft drinks are also acidic and can lead to tooth decay. Artificially sweetened drinks should not be included in the lunchbox.

India to explore legal framework to make trade transactions mandatory
The Indian Shipping Ministry is set to issue an order to make the port community system (PCS) mandatory for all Indian seaports, including public and private ports. The move is based on the recommendation of a 11-member panel set up at the behest of the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) in May this year to promote ease of doing business.
The panel headed by R K Agarwal, joint secretary (ports) in the Shipping Ministry, also recommended that a legal framework needs to be explored under various laws governing maritime trade stakeholders, to make it mandatory to carry out transactions through the PCS.
Mandating usage via a legal framework will ensure highly improved scores in ease of doing business, trade across borders and logistics performance index, the panel wrote in the report, a copy of which was reviewed by BusinessLine.
Portall, a logistics management application developed by Mumbai-based logistics conglomerate, J M Baxi Group, was awarded the contract by the Indian Ports Association, an autonomous body under the Shipping Ministry, to roll out a pan-India Port Community System (PCS) by December.
Portal PCS
Portall PCS will on-board all maritime stakeholders including major/non-major ports, container freight stations, inland container depots, inland waterways, coastal shipping, empty yards, freight forwarders, ship chandlers, bunker suppliers, non-vessel owning common carriers, director-general of lighthouses and light ships and the Federation of Indian Logistics Association, to help end-to-end trade transactions. Necessary technological changes must be made by all ports and other stakeholders to enable real-time information exchange with the PCS, it said. Portall has been asked to include, either through development or as a latch on, other functionalities such as transportation solution/ vehicle booking system for better vehicle planning to reduce congestion at ports, booking (cargo, containers, vessel slot), market place for goods and services to be taken up in association with the planned National Trade Portal, multi-modal shipments  Railways (container train operations, general cargo booking), coastal/inland waterways, single point for dues collection as the PCS will act as a payment aggregator gateway, thereby saving time, effort and money for stakeholders and quick settlement of transactions, international linkages with shipping lines, maritime registers as well as track and trace.

India tries teenage opener to fix top order
New Delhi, Wednesday: Skipper Virat Kohli said Wednesday India are looking to cement the teams misfiring top order as teenage opener Prithvi Shaw was named in the final 12 for the first Test against the West Indies.
The worlds number one Test side suffered from inconsistent top order during their overseas tours of South Africa and England, losing 1-2 and 1-4 respectively.
The two-match West Indies series starting in Rajkot on Thursday gives India an opportunity to work on their problem areas ahead of the all-important tour of Australia starting next month.
I think the top order getting cemented with these two Test matches, thats what we are looking at, Kohli told reporters.
These guys are new, so they will take a bit of time to get into it. But they definitely have the skill set, he said.
They should look at it as an opportunity and not think of pressure, because theyre very young, and its a great chance for them to cement their place and play for a long time.
The 18-year-old Shaw, who was chosen ahead of uncapped Mayank Agarwal and one-Test old Hanuma Vihari from the 15-man squad, is expected to open the batting alongside Lokesh Rahul.
Shaw has accumulated 1418 runs in 14 first-class games including seven centuries and made a strong showing for Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League Twenty20 tournament.
Left-handed opener Shikhar Dhawan managed just 162 runs in eight innings in seaming English conditions and was subsequently dropped ahead of the West Indies series.
India team for Rajkot Test: Virat Kohli (captain), Lokesh Rahul, Prithvi Shaw, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Rishabh Pant (wicketkeeper), Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Shardul Thakur. AFP

Indonesian  volcano erupts on  tsunami-hit island
INDONESIA: A volcano has erupted on the same central Indonesian island hit by a devastating earthquake and tsunami five days ago.
Mount Soputan, in North Sulawesi province, began spewing ash 6,000 metres (19,600 feet) into the sky on Wednesday morning.
Authorities warned about the risk to planes from volcanic ash in the air. A huge aid operation is under way on the island for survivors with no access to electricity or running water.
It comes after at least 1,340 people are known to have died after a 7.5-magnitude quake struck just off the island on Friday, triggering a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu.
The volcanic eruption status was raised from an alert to standby 2.5 miles from the summit of Mouth Soputan. Standby status means the public should avoid the area nearest the volcano and have masks available in the event of ashfall. No evacuations were immediately ordered, but planes were warned of the ash clouds because volcanic ash is hazardous for engines. Mount Soputan is located about 900km north-east of the quake-ravaged region and there were no immediate reports of any casualties from the volcanic eruption.
President Joko Widodo headed back to the quake-affected areas for a second time on Wednesday to supervise rescue and relief operations as reports of mass looting of food and other goods emerged. The death toll may rise, as rescuers are unable to extricate people suspected to be buried under buildings that collapsed due to liquefaction, a phenomenon that causes soil to lose its strength after violent shaking, according to Dr Sutopo. Though Central Sulawesi accounts for only about 1 per cent of the countrys gross domestic product, the reconstruction cost may weigh on the governments finances as it battles a slump in the currency.
The rupiah weakened past 15,000 per dollar for the first time in 20 years on Tuesday and is down 10 per cent this year.
The quake and volcano may also hurt the nations all-important tourism industry, which was rattled by a series of deadly earthquakes on the popular tourist destination of Lombok island, near Bali.

Investment Mission to Germany yields new opportunities for Lanka
The Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, together with the Board of Investment, Export Development Board, and the AHK Germany, led a successful investment and export promotion visit to Germany last week.
During the 3-day 3-city promotion mission led by Malik Samarawickrama, Sri Lankas interests and capabilities in the trade and investment arena were showcased to a range of German and European investors ranging from international logistics players, high-end equipment manufacturers, to importers of processed products. The delegation also comprised a private sector team drawn from apparels, logistics, real estate, and automotives. For the first time in history in the country, a Sri Lankan tech startup was also part of the official delegation. Sri Lankas Ambassador to Germany Karunasena Hettiarachchi also participated in the meetings.
A business forum was conducted in each of the three cities of Frankfurt, Hamburg and Berlin, during which Minister Samarawickrama as well as BOI Director General Duminda Ariyasinghe and EDB Chairperson Indira Malwatte addressed the audiences of German investors on the investment opportunities in Sri Lanka and proactive facilitation by the Government.
In his address to the participants, the Minister said German companies can enjoy the benefit of being located in a strategic geographic location, from which you can reach out to India, South Asia, East Asia, as well as Africa and the Middle East.
With our continuing focusing on business-friendly reforms, we will always be there to help you to set up and operate smoothly. He emphasized that German companies investing in Sri Lanka can take advantage of the countrys free trade agreements giving preferential access to India, Pakistan, European Union and soon to Thailand and China. In addition to the forums, the delegation held a series of targeted one-to-one meetings with interested German investors in order to provide them with a deeper understanding of the opportunities and the business climate. Meetings were held with top German and European brands like BBraun, Hellmann Logistics, TV Rheinland, Siemens, Fresenius, TUI Group, SAP, Heidelberg Cement, Melchers Group, Linde Group, DER Touristik, Allianz and the German Tea Council. During the one-to-one meetings the Minister remarked that, The world has accepted that German companies are trend setters  whether it is in quality, safety, or technology. We want to attract them to Sri Lanka, to partner with our companies, so that it elevates our entire economy.

Johnston seeks bail from SC
Former Minister and Kurunegala District MP Johnston Fernando, has filed a Special Leave to Appeal application in the Supreme Court seeking an Interim Order directing the Kurunegala High Court to release him on bail until the final determination of this application.
A revision application filed by former Minister Johnston Fernando seeking an interim order to release on bail was yesterday refused by the Court of Appeal.
Johnston Fernando remanded in connection with the misappropriation of Rs. 5.2 million in public funds, filed this application challenging the Kurunegala High Court order to remand him until the conclusion of the trial. He is also challenging the Court of Appeal judgement dated September 17, 2018, to dismiss the petitioners revision application.

Koepka heartbroken after Ryder Cup fan blinded in one eye
Paris, Wednesday: Triple major winner Brooks Koepka said Tuesday he was heartbroken that a Ryder Cup fan hit by his wayward tee shot had been blinded in one eye.
Koepka posted a statement on Twitter saying he had been in contact with Corine Remande and her family and offered his heartfelt sympathy.
Frenchwoman Remande, aged 49, said she was taking legal action against the events organisers after being hit on Fridays opening day, when Koepkas drive on the par-four sixth hole careered into the crowd at Le Golf National near Paris.
I spoke to her at the time on the golf course and after now learning her condition is worse than first thought, I have made contact with her family to offer my sincere and heartfelt sympathy, said Koepka.
I am heartbroken by the incident. My thoughts remain with Ms. Remande and her family, and I have asked to be kept informed on her condition.
Remande launched her legal action in the French city of Lyon on Tuesday. The complaint, seen by AFP, alleges organisers were responsible for a lack of safety rules.
The player should have shouted ball, or fore for English speakers. Given the distance, the stewards should have relayed this information to the green, she adds in the complaint. Remande told AFP after being examined at a Lyon hospital on Monday: They told me Id lost the sight in my right eye and this was confirmed to me today.
She has a fractured eye socket and a damaged eyeball. Remande said there was no warning from stewards at the course before the ball hurtled into the gallery.
Quite clearly, there is responsibility on the part of the organisers, she told AFP.
She and her husband Raphael had travelled to France from their home in Egypt to watch the biennial showdown between Europe and the United States.
Ryder Cup organisers said they would continue to offer support to Remande, but said a warning was shouted to spectators.
We can confirm that fore was shouted several times but also appreciate how hard it can be to know when and where every ball is struck if you are in the crowd, a statement said.
It is distressing to hear that someone might suffer long term consequences from a ball strike, the organisers said. Ball strikes are an occasional hazard for spectators but this kind of incident is extremely rare. Organisers said they had been in contact with the family and had helped with the logistics of repatriation, including providing a transfer for the family from Paris to Lyon.
We will continue to offer support for as long as necessary. AFP

Laugfs Gas, Hambantota Port to make Lanka energy hub
Laugfs Gas, is currently working towards making Sri Lanka an energy hub, and Hambantota Port is their launch pad for this ambitious plan. They are of the view that the port being strategically placed in one of the worlds unique locations works to their advantage.
The company believes that they are well placed to become a big competitor to Singapore, and Sri Lanka bringing in a strong strategic partner like CMPort as a port operator, will be a tipping point that would propel the country to a new age of trade and commerce.
The Laugfs Groups potential customers are some of the fast growing economies positioned in close proximity to the Hambantota Port like, India, Bangladesh, Maldives, Myanmar and East Coast of Africa. With a mega LPG storage complex already established adjacent to this southern port, Laugfs believes they could provide their target markets, a much better service than their competitors.
Once it is commissioned in November 2018, this will be the largest and most modern LPG related infrastructure in the Indian Ocean rim area.
W. K. H. Wegapitiya, Group Chairman of Laugfs Holdings said, Hambantota Port was under-utilized and did not bring any value to the overall national equation. Therefore, a strategic partner was necessary to develop the port fast. This is not just for the logistics or shipping sector, but also for the economic spillover which will benefit the whole country. GDP will develop, there will be employment opportunities and wealth creation, Wegapitiya believes that today the world is moving away from old fashioned ideas.
Laugfs has plans to bring LPG in larger vessels from international markets like the Gulf, US, Singapore etc., to Hambantota.
The Group Chairman said that the ports two jetties dedicated for oil, gas and petroleum business, makes it convenient for the company, especially since the port will provide them with a connection facility to unload vessels through a pipeline connecting to their facility which is about 3 km from the jetty.

LTTE Magazine prison detainees on hunger strike
A group of around 43 LTTE detainees commenced a hunger strike at the Colombo Magazine Prison yesterday, according to the Prison Commissioner.
These detainees are said to have commenced the strike demanding that their cases be expedited.
Meanwhile, last month, eight Tamil political prisoners at the Anuradhapura prison, launched a hunger strike demanding that they be released following a quick rehabilitation programme.
A number of Tamil political prisoners are still in prison for years under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), without charges being filed against them.
Meanwhile, speaking to the Daily News, TNA MP Dharmalingam Sidharthan said the TNA leadership had met with the Justice Minister on Tuesday and held discussions regarding the release of these Tamil political prisoners.
He said that the Justice Minister was in favour of releasing a few of the prisoners, but the TNA would not accept that proposal as it would be unfair to the others.
These prisoners are lamenting in prisons for 10 to 11 years without trial under the PTA. I met with the prime Minister as well and he assured that he would discuss this issue with the Attorney General and seek his opinion. However, nothing seems to be happening.
Sidharthan noted that the government gave an assurance to the UN and the TNA as well that they would release these political prisoners. The Tamil people voted for the government having placed a lot of faith in them, but now the Tamil people are losing faith in the government. They are even losing faith in the TNA because of this situation. In fact during the Rajapaksa regime, they released over 12,000 Tamil political prisoners similar to those still in prison. The Tamils voted for this government and I hope the government will honour their pledge to them.

Many names  for Nobel  Peace Prize
NORWAY: Donald Trump Hardly. Reconciliation between the Koreas Rather premature. Peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea Probably missed the deadline. As the 2018 Nobel peace prize looms, its easier to rule out names than guess whos going to win.
This year the field of possibilities facing the five members of the Norwegian committee tasked with awarding the prize was pretty wide, with 331 individuals and organisations proposed for the prestigious prize, which will be announced on Friday in Oslo.
And, as usual, despite the fact the list of candidates is a secret, predictions about who might win are gathering pace.
With the postponement of this years Literature Prize for the first time in 70 years over a #MeToo scandal at the Swedish Academy, Fridays peace award has become the most highly anticipated Nobel announcement this year.
Looking at the odds on some of the online betting sites, you might think North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in were the front-runners for their efforts at rapprochement between the two nations.
But the Nobel experts -- who are more often than not wrong -- are scratching their heads.
On the one hand, the inter-Korean breakthrough is I think the most dramatic thing in this field this year, said Dan Smith, head of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).
On the other hand I wonder whether it would be premature to be giving the prize on that basis this year. Apart from anything else, Kims record on human rights hardly stands in his favour.
Could Moon get it on his own (He) did well, with the peace-promoting use of the (Winter) Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, said Peter Wallensteen, a Swedish professor who specialises in international relations.
But what of Trump Certain international figures like Britains Boris Johnson, when he was foreign minister, and even Moon himself have suggested the US leader could win the prize for his initiatives on the Korean peninsula.
At 7-1, the bombastic American president is one of three frontrunners flagged by online bookies Betsson, far ahead of other global figures like Frances Emmanuel Macron, Britains Theresa May and Russias Vladimir Putin all with odds of 75-1.
Such a prize would be inappropriate, said Smith, pointing to a string of decisions by Trump which are very negative as far as peace is concerned, most notably withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement and the Iran nuclear deal.
And in any case, the only known Trump nomination submitted to the Nobel committee was fake, filed by someone suspected of identity fraud as only certain individuals are allowed to propose names.
The nascent reconciliation between Ethiopia and Eritrea has also fuelled hope that a durable peace can be reached between the two neighbouring countries after 20 years of war.
For Wallensteen, the peace prize could go to Ethiopian Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed. But he only took power in April with his peace overtures coming to fruition this summer.
That is a little late for the Nobel committee, which takes nominations at the start of the year.
Given the lack of certainty and the limited scope of progress on potentially prize-winning initiatives, some observers are turning to some longer-term contenders.
With the #MeToo movement raising global awareness about sexual abuse and harassment, the award could honour those engaged in the fight against sexual violence, such as Congolese gynaecologist Denis Mukwege or Yazidi rape victim Nadia Murad.
Nominated many times in the past, Mukwege has spent two decades helping women recover from the violence and trauma of rape in war-torn eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, while Murad became an activist after being kidnapped by Islamic State group militants and held as a sex slave.
Henrik Urdal, head of the Peace Research Institute of Oslo (Prio), believes the award could go to the UNs World Food Programme (WFP), which feeds millions of starving people every year.
From the battlefields of Yemen to the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, we are seeing now that hunger is becoming again one of the bigger humanitarian challenges of our time, he said.
Other potential laureates include the UN refugee agency UNHCR, jailed Saudi blogger Raif Badawi, organisations defending the media such as Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists (RSF) and Russian human rights champions like the NGO Memorial and opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta. - AFP

Nestl wins Highest Foreign Exchange Earner award at Presidential Export Awards
Nestl continued its winning streak at the recently held Presidential Export Awards, bagging the Highest Foreign Exchange Earner award in the Coconut Kernel product category.
This marks the seventh Presidential Export Award for the company in recognition of its strong contribution to national exports, and efforts to create sustainable livelihoods for local coconut growers and farm workers.
Nestl Lanka is one of the worlds largest exporters of coconut milk powder. The product is exported to over 50 countries, and is sold locally under the Maggi brand. It is manufactured in Nestls state-of-the-art factory in Kurunegala, where the company procures around 90 million Sri Lankan coconuts every year; providing a livelihood to more than 6,000 local coconut farming families.
Jos Roldn, Vice President, Supply Chain at Nestl said, The Presidential Export Awards is the highest form of recognition given to exporters in Sri Lanka. Were proud to have leveraged a Sri Lankan staple like coconut to develop a world-leading product, and are honoured to accept this award in recognition of our success. Our efforts have made Sri Lankan coconut milk powder one of the most sought after in the world; offering superior taste and quality.
Nestl pioneered coconut milk powder manufacturing in the 1980s and continues to invest in the local industry. Its Nestl Coconut Plan was launched in 2016 in collaboration with the Coconut Cultivation Board. The Plan supports farmers to grow coconut commercially and also out-growers to cultivate coconut in their home gardens for domestic use.
The programme works with people within the traditional coconut triangle and also in new experimental areas in the North-Central and Northern provinces. Since its inception, the Nestl Coconut Plan has provided 3,000 farmers and outgrowers almost 20,000 coconut plant-lets of a special hybrid variety, which is more resilient with a faster yield. Programme participants also receive regular training, resources, and agronomical support, and are able to benchmark best practices via model farms set up by Nestl. Shivani Hegde, Nestl Managing Director said, We are honoured to be recognised once again for our contribution to the exports sector and for the work we do in enhancing the lives of people throughout our value chain. Were helping local suppliers improve their quality standards and empowering farmers to grow crops that benefit them. Our objective is to build thriving resilient communities; and help rural communities earn a sustainable income that will benefit them and their families, whilst securing coconut supply for the generations ahead. We strongly believe that any investment we make should not just be good for the company but for the country too, and were proud to be upholding this in all that we do.

Organised crime thrives on  tobacco smuggling: RIU
The illicit tobacco network is increasingly becoming a threat to national law and order as well as security, the Research Intelligence Unit (RIU) said.
Benefitting from access to new markets with different legal and cultural conditions, organised crime has expanded its engagement in illicit trade significantly.
In a recent report on the tobacco industry, the RIU said the trade is used extensively by organised crime groups to profit.
Given softer penalties compared to higher profits, criminals have developed sophisticated mechanisms to smuggle goods into Sri Lanka. The RIU report says a focus group comprising various stakeholders involved in prevention and policymaking agreed that the growth in the illicit trade of tobacco is serving to increase the spread of organised crime, gangs and criminal activity.
It results in higher social cost in addition to driving the consumption of other forms of drugs.

Pamper your CROWN
Aromatic oils can work wonders for your mind and body. Head massages are great forms of relaxation as they can help you release the tension of the day. Plus they can also assist with a variety of physical and emotional problems and concerns. So if you desire thick, shiny, and beautiful hair then make head massage an integral part of your hair care ritual
Defining a scalp massage
A scalp massage is a head massage designed to relax the mind and encourage circulation. Many times, tension is felt within the head and neck, so scalp massages can be very much effective as a stress reducer. Warm oil is massaged throughout the scalp, working to relax tight muscles in the temple and neck regions.
Types of head massages
Indian or Champissage: This is a vigorous treatment and focuses on the blood circulation for head, shoulders, and neck. Although it can be deeper pressure, it should not be painful.
Tibetan Scalp Massage: This is a very relaxing experience involving acupressure and the balancing of energy pathways. It is often a slow, detailed treatment.
Ayurvedic Massage: This is a very relaxing head massage treatment that involves pouring a tiny stream of warm, herbal oil over the third eye (forehead) for 30 to 45 minutes, followed by a few minutes of head and face massage.
Since these traditional massage techniques use a generous amount of oil for the massage, you may want to plan on a trip home for a shampoo before venturing out in public. Its well worth it!
Signs that you need a scalp massage
Youve been getting headaches: When the muscles around your shoulders, back and head get tight, tension headaches can begin. Regular maintenance massage can relieve these tension headaches and help promote healthy posture. Massage therapy has been shown to provide some relief for migraine sufferers as well.
You are stressed out: Lets face it. Most of us have a little more stress in our lives than what is probably healthy. One of the best ways to decrease levels of stress hormones and increase levels of endorphins is to get a massage. Massage therapy starts working immediately to help you relax.
Massages to stimulate hair growth
Massages help your hair grow as fast as possible. Scalp massages stimulate the blood circulation and this in turn channels more nutrients to the hair roots. The increased circulation ensures the best starting conditions for every individual hair.
Benefits of a scalp massage
Headache relief
Scalp massage can help relieve tension headaches. When performing a scalp massage on someone with a tension headache, spend extra time on the base of the skull, near the hairline, because tension often accumulates in this area. It can also help to include a massage of the forehead and temples when massaging to relieve a tension headache. Scalp massage can also help relieve symptoms of migraine headaches in some individuals.
Increased circulation to scalp
Scalp massage helps improve circulation of blood to the head and face. Increased circulation at the roots of hair can promote healthy hair growth. If oil is used for the scalp massage, it can also help get rid of dandruff. The use of oil on the scalp can also help prevent new dandruff from occurring.
Feeling of well-being
Scalp massage feels great and can help you feel more relaxed and content. If the face is included in the scalp massage, as is often the case, it can also help reduce the appearance of wrinkles, because the face is less pinched when relaxed.
Better sleep
Those who suffer from insomnia can find relief from having a scalp massage. Many people sleep better when they have regular massage, with improvement in both falling asleep and staying asleep. Conversely, scalp massage can also help those with fatigue feel more energized.
Compiled by Ruwini Jayawardana
Selecting the massage oil
Choosing the massage oil also depends on your hair type.
If you have a specific condition that needs to be treated you can use an oil that may help with this condition. Here are a few options of oils that can be used for different hair types.
Coconut oil: Coconut oil is one of my favourite oils. Not only does it promote growth, it also softens and conditions hair.
Olive oil: Olive oil is a little on the heavy side. It contains vitamin A, Vitamin E, and moisturizes the scalp and the hair.
Avocado oil: Avocado oil is great especially if your hair is dry, since it is super moisturizing.
Jojoba oil: Jojoba oil in a way, reminds me of coconut oil. It doesnt weigh down your hair, yet it leaves it soft and manageable
Almond oil: I have never tried almond oil, however, I will be trying it soon. It nourishes hair while conditioning and promoting growth.

Pathfinder represented at International Conference on BRI in Katmandu
Admiral Prof. Jayanath Colombage, Director of the Centres for Indo-Lanka Initiatives and Law of the Sea of the Pathfinder Foundation presented a paper titled Belt and Road Initiative (BRI): Myths Vs Reality - A Sri Lankan Perspective at the international conference on BRI held in Kathmandu.
The international conference, Belt and Road Initiative: Opportunities and Implications for Nepal and the Region was organized by the Masters International Relations and Diplomacy (MIRD) programme, held at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.
The conference was designed to examine opportunities, implications and challenges of BRI to Nepal and other countries in the region, especially India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand. The international event looked at the multifaceted aspects of BRI, its implications and challenges to South Asia and South East Asia.
The aim of the conference was to raise pertinent questions, such as what could be learnt from the experiences of Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Laos, Thailand and Pakistan from BRI projects Prime Minister of Nepal, KP Sharma Oli inaugurated the event and delivered the keynote address. In his address he said, The transformative scale and scope of BRI has opened up a plethora of opportunities to integrate the economies, to markets and to invest in infrastructure.
He also reiterated the wish of Nepal to transform from a Land-locked country to land-linked country. The Prime Minister further said that regional initiatives such as SAARC and BIMSTEC are important platforms for multi-dimensional regional connectivity.
The day-long conference was attended by scholars, professionals and subject matter experts from Bangladesh, India, Laos, Nepal, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Admiral Prof. Jayanath Colombage representing Pathfinder Foundation shared his views on myths and realities of the BRI and Sri Lankas experience.
He emphasized the need for Sri Lanka to develop rapidly, specially after ending the three-decade long conflict in 2009 by capitalizing on its advantageous geographical location in the Indian Ocean. He stated that major Infrastructure development projects in Sri Lanka by China have become a source of debate in the media, including among the academia and policy makers. There are different interpretations on the subject, based on perceptions of individuals or parties. Some of these arguments are based on one sided information conveniently ignoring related facts. Others are based on wild extrapolations from individual cases.
Some such attempts appear to be part of a grand strategy originating beyond the shores of Sri Lanka. Such articles and discussions are then used by different individuals and groups to argue their case. Admiral Colombage made some recommendations for China as well as recipient countries to address the negative concerns relating to BRI. He stressed that BRI is considered as an opportunity by many states to develop infrastructure through which their economies.

A pitch to develop Baseball in Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka Baseball is joining hands with Horizon Campus, Colombo, to improve the game of Baseball in our country. Although it is not as widely acclaimed as cricket, rugby and basketball,
Baseball is a sport that is rapidly gaining popularity. Currently Sri Lanka is ranked 40th out of the 120 registered countries worldwide and ranked No.7 in Asia. Our team has proved its proves by winning the West Asia Cup in 2017 and bagging a Bronze Medal at the Asia Baseball Cup held in Indonesia in 2015. The Sri Lanka Baseball Team took part in the 2018 Asia Games and performed reasonably well registering its first win in the Tournament. Furthermore, our Under 18 National Team is ranked 5th in Asia. This goes to show that Sri Lankan players have the potential to shine on the field.
A sport introduced to our country in 1985 by the American Embassy to two schools and two clubs, the very first game was played in the same year. Colombo, Kandy and Galle, the three main districts that have embraced the game, have formed what is popularly known as the Baseball Triangle. In addition, Baseball has caught on in Kurunegala, Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura. Currently it is played in most of the Universities and has gained enough stature to be included in the University Games. The game of Baseball has been an amateur sport in Sri Lanka since the inception. The Sri Lanka Baseball/Softball Association (SLABSA) is driven by its energetic President Fazil Hussain and his hard working Committee who have succeeded in driving the game. Currently the Committee is striving to achieve an ambitious goal of broadening its reach island-wide, covering all 9 Provinces, 25 districts and 98 Educational zones by 2025.
Towards this target, they have employed 2 full time administrators and has brought on board the reputed educational institution Horizon Campus to take it to the grass roots level where they believe the hidden talent lies. Sri Lankas Baseball players come from all corners of the Island since the game is similar Elle, which is one of our national sports and Cricket, which is by far the most popular sport.
Speaking about their 2025 target, Fazil Hussain the President of Sri Lanka Baseball said, We believe that Sri Lanka has the potential to be one of the super powers in the future. He went on to say that the SLABSA is privileged to have the former Army Commander, General Daya Ratnayake, to head the Development Committee. We are certain with his knowledge and energy. Baseball will be a sport to be reckoned with, he added. The Baseball Association will be conducting their first development program in Jaffna and then moving on to Kilinochchi during the first week of October. To date Sri Lanka has 30 Clubs playing in the National league and 28 Schools taking part in the Schools Tournament.
The SLABSA is privileged to have 2 Japanese volunteer Coaches based in Sri Lanka along with Baseball grounds at Biyagama where tournaments will be conducted. Currently the Baseball Federation is working with the Sports Ministry to develop the Biyagama Stadium into a state-of-the-art venue complete with all necessary facilities and accommodation. Commenting on the involvement of Horizon Campus with Baseball, Nilantha Rathnayake, Group Marketing Director said, We are proud to be a part of this project to develop Baseball in Sri Lanka. We are already making our mark in the region and I believe that this sport will benefit the youth across Sri Lanka.

Just in case...it is the concluding 3rd leg of Asian 7s.
Much pride for Sri Rugby hosting the glamourous 2 days of pure skill and adrenaline.
More pride indeed to note ur iconic racecourse as the best running surface in Asia, and still improving on the pro fundamentals.
The month of Octaviius hands hosts Sri paradise...,.a perfect opportunity for a top 2 finish instead of Japan or Hong Kong.....home turf advantage looming large and hugely considered.
This is definitely our litmus test under pressure and time to stun Asia with our island class.
Naturally our whole 7s future lies squarely on the shoulders of our selectors , coaching staff and eventually our players.
But its all fully based and centres on injuries plus expert rehab.
Destiny on hold till key players cleared protocol and shipshape to play.
Lets not dwell on that slice of team stats....rather the quality of Muthu, Gayan Weere, Jason Dass, Sooriya B, Danushka Ranjan ..all good to go.
Vital our finishers have good ball to chalk out the glam step ups in the middle.
If we sort it all in our dressing room..the home crowd will charge the hearts max for some scintillating 7s skills in the middle.
The men and women burdened with ke.y player injuries....need to literally play out of their skins.
Captains Muthu and Sanju, have to demand more from each player.
They need to surprise themselves and their fanatical fans, in every form possible.
Converting pressure into points like oxygen for each one.
Imperative their belief dominates every second of time ..on and off the pitch, till our job is done.
Coaches Woods and Sampath...need to focus heavily on our home advantage...and motivate our warriors accordingly...each second counts....live the dream of winning at home.
Combinations and recycling players are the rocket fuel that makes the difference.
Expectations are bigger than ever...and thru the proverbial roof.
Time for us deckchair experts to speculate on sea level oxygen and the mental capacity to live at this top altitude of Asian rugby.
Absolutely remarkable SRI has made the grades....but essential we shock in the middle.
Translated , means we not out pace but also take our physicality to the highest.
Exactly the same mantra for both our squads...no hesitation...pressure..pressure..presdsure....every minute counts.
The workrate must stun the opposition into mistakes...
Warriors to force the issues.
As hosts of the finals ..its important that chief Bonsa, Nazeem, Illyas and our top brass get Sri on that radar..focus on 7s development from 15yrs up.
We must be absolutely PROLIFIC.
For players its a critical rehab graph that gets our stars glittering again..
Issues about match fitness to be answered in the middle.
The writings on the racecourse wall.
Inspire the island.
Bula bula big SRI HEARTS.!!!

Rapid growth in Pragmatic cooperation between China and Sri Lanka
Ambassador of the Peoples Republic of Cheng Xueyuan in Sri Lanka says that over the past year, pragmatic cooperation between China and Sri Lanka has developed rapidly.
The reclamation of the Colombo Port City will complete soon and the second phase of development is about to start. The Port City could become the new driving force of Sri Lankas development and the new financial centre of South Asia, he said.
The Ambassador was addressing the 69th Anniversary of the Founding of the Peoples Republic of China in Colombo last week.
He said that subsequent to the China - Sri Lanka joint venture for Hambantota Port, the profits have almost doubled. In future, the interactive development of port, industrial park and city could become the new engine of Sri Lankas economy.
Comminuting on the infrastructure development under taken by China he said that the Moragahakanda Reservoir Headworks Project was completed and handed over successfully. The extension of the Southern Railway and that of the Southern Expressway linking Colombo and Hambantota are drawing to a close.
China has become Sri Lankas second largest source of tourists. There were more than 260,000 Chinese tourists to Sri Lanka in 2017 and this number is estimated to exceed 300,000 in 2018.
China has also become an important destination for overseas study and training for Sri Lanka people.
Highlighting the economic development in China he said that Chinas GDP has increased from 360 billion Yuan to 82.7 trillion Yuan, growing at an annual average rate of 9.5%.
Today, China has become the worlds second largest economy, largest industrial country and largest trader of goods with the largest foreign exchange reserves.
Around 700 million Chinese people have been lifted out of poverty, accounting for more than 70% of the global total over the same period.
He said that 2018 marks the 5th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and it developed from an initiative to a reality, from a vision to an important platform for building a community of shared future for mankind and has become a well-received public product internationally. With the active participation of over 100 countries, regions and international organizations, a large number of cooperation projects have been settled.
The value of trade in goods between China and countries along the Belt and Road has exceeded 5.5 trillion US dollars. Chinas non-financial direct investment to these countries exceeded over 80 billion US dollars. We have built 82 overseas economic and trade cooperation zones in these countries with a total investment of 28.9 billion US dollars, which created 244,000 job opportunities for the local people.
With its promotion and deepening all over the world, the BRI has also become the most important framework of consensus for the friendly and pragmatic cooperation between China and Sri Lanka.
China will hold the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai and has officially invited President Maithripala Sirisena to attend the opening ceremony leading the Sri Lanka delegation.

Real Madrid suffer shock defeat as Man Utd stutter again
Paris, Tuesday: Champions League holders Real Madrid slumped to a rare defeat in the competition as they went down 1-0 away to CSKA Moscow on Tuesday, while Jose Mourinhos Manchester United misfired again in a 0-0 draw with Valencia.
While Bayern Munich were also held by Ajax, it was a happier evening for Pep Guardiolas Manchester City as they beat Hoffenheim 2-1, and Juventus were also comfortable winners thanks to Paulo Dybalas hat-trick.
Real were not expected to struggle in Group G as they look to continue their recent dominance of the Champions League, but Julen Lopeteguis side went behind inside two minutes in Moscow following a mistake by Toni Kroos.
The Germans drilled backpass turned into a gift for Nikola Vlasic, and the winger on loan from Everton fired past Keylor Navas to put CSKA ahead.
Casemiro hit the post in the first half -- one of three attempts that found the woodwork for the visitors -- but Real were weakened by the absences of Gareth Bale and Sergio Ramos, while Luka Modric started on the bench. CSKA held on, despite having goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev sent off in injury time, and they move above Real to the top of Group G.
I am sure we will soon be scoring again and winning again, said Lopetegui, whose team have not found the net in three matches.
It was only Madrids third defeat in the Champions League group stage this decade, but Real will nevertheless expect to bounce back next against Czech champions Viktoria Plzen, who were crushed 5-0 by Roma.
Edin Dzeko scored a hat-trick for the Italian side, with Cengiz Under and Justin Kluivert also netting.
At Old Trafford, the pressure continued to build on Mourinho as United produced another insipid attacking display in their goalless stalemate with Valencia.
They are now four games without a win, and Mourinhos decision to recall Alexis Sanchez -- after dropping the Chilean for the weekend defeat at West Ham United -- failed to pay off.
Our attacking players arent in their best moments of confidence and individual level, moaned Mourinho. We thought with three or four chances we would score and win the game.
Mourinhos side are second in Group H, two points behind Juventus.
Juve eased to victory against 10-man Young Boys in Turin, with Dybala scoring a hat-trick to take centre stage in the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo, who was serving a one-game ban.
We were without Cristiano, and at times it is easier with him in the side, but we have to be a great team both with and without him, said Dybala.
Guardiola saw Manchester City come from behind to beat Hoffenheim in Germany in Group F.
David Silva scored three minutes from time to get the Premier League champions back on track after they started their campaign with a 2-1 home defeat against Lyon.
Ishak Belfodil had put Hoffenheim ahead after just 44 seconds, but Sergio Aguero equalised in the eighth minute before Silvas late winner.
This competition isnt always a red carpet. Manchester City is a fantastic club, but we dont have a history of having to fight and we fought for absolutely everything here, said Guardiola.
This is one of the happiest days I have had at this club as it will help us going forward.
City next face Shakhtar Donetsk, who squandered a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with Lyon in France, in a game played behind closed doors.
Brazilian forward Junior Moraes scored twice for Shakhtar, but Lyon fought back to draw with goals from Moussa Dembele and Leo Dubois.
It was a good result for Lyon, whose fans were missing as a punishment for trouble at a game against CSKA last season, and they now top the group.
Meanwhile, Bayern could not hang on to the early lead given to them against Ajax when Mats Hummels headed in Arjen Robbens cross. Young full-back Noussair Mazraoui equalised to give the Dutch side a 1-1 draw.
Those sides are level atop Group E ahead of Benfica, who won 3-2 in a thriller at AEK Athens with Alfa Semedo scoring the deciding goal. AFP

## Title: Scientific  validation  of fluoridated  toothpaste

Scientific  validation  of fluoridated  toothpaste
This article is written in pursuance of professional duty so that people may adopt healthy habits and lifestyles consistent with evidence-based scientific truth rather than being beguiled and deceived by false propaganda, media hype and advertising. It is now a well established scientifically proven incontrovertible fact that cleaning the teeth daily with a fluoride toothpaste plays a significant role in the prevention of dental caries. Consequently, the apparently increasing market share of non-fluoride toothpastes sold in Sri Lanka is cause for concern. For example, it would seem that the market share of one brand of toothpaste that does not contain fluoride has increased from 3.5 percent to 14 percent between 2013 and 2017.
We must not forget that even allowing for changes in oral disease patterns worldwide, dental caries (i.e., cavities in teeth) continues to be one of the commonest diseases in the world. Though not life threatening, it is potentially an extremely painful disease with the potential to ruin quality of life by making chewing difficult and spoiling the enjoyment of food, along with disastrous effects on facial appearance when the front teeth are affected. The social impact of dental disease in children is such that 51 million schooldays are lost to dental related illness every year!
No doubt, throughout the ages, treatment of the disease has made many dentists rich and prosperous especially with the availability of increasingly complex highly remunerative restorative therapies and modern technologies. On the other hand, countless patients worldwide will testify to the intolerable burden of high treatment costs, quite apart from the ravages of the disease and the discomfort of treatment that may involve prolonged stressful periods lying in a dental chair with the mouth open!
According to the World Health Organization, worldwide, 6090 percent of schoolchildren and nearly 100 percent of adults have dental cavities. In Sri Lanka, 60 percent of six year olds have dental caries. The prevalence in 12 and 3544 year olds is estimated to be around 30 percent and 80 percent respectively. Few diseases in the world have such a high prevalence. And to make matters worse, a review of epidemiological data from many countries in 2009 suggested that there might be a marked increase in prevalence taking place worldwide.
And yet dental caries is almost totally preventable with the combination of the simplest of methods including a lifelong low sugar diet, daily brushing with a fluoridated toothpaste, and the maintenance of good oral hygiene. That the disease continues to be a public health problem reflects public ignorance. But it is hard to escape the conclusion that there must also be a degree of professional indolence and indifference even at the highest levels where the eagerness to treat the disease is not matched by passion to prevent it.
It is against this background that any trend towards the aggressive marketing and popularisation of non-fluoride toothpastes in Sri Lanka must be seen as retrogressive and harmful to dental health. It runs contrary to the scientific imperative to do exactly the opposite and aim for 100 percent daily use of a fluoride toothpaste by the Sri Lankan population. A few examples will suffice to show the overwhelming scientific evidence and universal expert endorsement supporting the daily use of a fluoride containing toothpaste:

1. Following a review of 74 studies of fluoride toothpaste for the prestigious Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in 2003, the authors concluded that fluoride toothpastes have been widely used for over three decades and remain a benchmark intervention for the prevention of dental caries. Supported by more than half a century of research, the benefits of fluoride toothpastes are firmly established. Children who brush their teeth at least once a day with a toothpaste that contains fluoride will have less tooth decay.

2. A World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee as far back as 1984 concluded that routine use of fluoride dentifrices is recommended practically everywhere, except for young children living in areas of endemic fluorosis and that the findings of over 100 clinical trials indicate that fluoridated toothpastes reduces cavities by 2030 percent. According to distinguished scientists who in 2004 reviewed the WHO approach for the prevention of dental caries in the 21st century, WHO recommends that every effort must be made to develop affordable fluoride toothpastes for use in developing countries. They even went on to say that accordingly, it would be in the best interests of countries to exempt fluoride toothpastes from all duties and taxes imposed on cosmetics.

3. The General Assembly of the International Dental Federation (FDI) in a resolution first adopted in 2000 and modified in 2018, affirmed that regular use of fluoride toothpaste is scientifically recognised as a major means to reduce the prevalence and severity of dental caries and delay its onset in the global population, and urged all countries to recognise the importance of providing universal access to fluoride toothpaste to fight dental caries.

4. In the UK, Public Health England, an agency of the Department of Health, in its 2017 Evidence based Toolkit for the prevention of dental disease, advocated the appropriate use of fluoride toothpaste at least twice daily in adults as well as in children from the moment the teeth erupt into the mouth.

5. One of the most significant transformations in disease patterns in the history of medical epidemiology was the dramatic decline of dental caries in industrialised countries in the latter half of the 20th century, with reductions in lifetime caries experience exceeding 75 percent. While there have been differing opinions about the reasons for this decline, an opinion survey of 52 selected experts in the mid 1990s showed that the daily, if not twice daily use of fluoridated toothpaste was considered to be the most important single factor by most experts.
The above represent a small sample of the monumental scientific evidence and unanimous expert opinion validating the twice daily use of a fluoride toothpaste for the prevention of dental caries. Accordingly, it is not surprising that in many countries fluoride toothpastes make up more than 95 percent of toothpaste sales, whatever the brand.
But it would be surprising and indeed ominous if as seems to be the case in Sri Lanka there is an opposite trend towards using non-fluoridated toothpastes to clean the teeth! That there seems to have been so little reaction to such adverse trends that are a travesty of the scientific evidence and a danger to dental health may reflect poorly on the dental profession in Sri Lanka.
There are nowadays more dentists, more dental consultants, more dental administrators, more dental academics, and more dental professional organisations than ever before. Given such a large and influential dental establishment, one would expect the proliferation of non-fluoridated toothpastes to be bitterly resisted and opposed by the dental profession. On the contrary, it is sad to note that a few years ago a leading dental professional organisation actually signed an MOU with a commercial organisation endorsing a toothpaste that does not contain fluoride!
Furthermore, the aggressive marketing of non-fluoride toothpaste carries the deceptive insinuation that such products are efficacious in preventing dental caries.
In creating this impression advertisers fall back on some limited investigations (seemingly funded by the manufacturers themselves) and published in a local journal.
Even so, the results from these studies are confined to demonstrating the effects of the non-fluoride toothpaste tested not on dental caries, but on bacterial plaque and gum disease  and even that, over a very limited study duration!
To imply from these results that such products have any advantage whatsoever over a standard fluoride toothpaste in reducing dental caries would be dishonest, especially as dental caries is a sugar-related disease where demonstrating the anti-caries effect of any new toothpaste necessitates a rigorous three-year randomised controlled clinical trial.
In anticipation of such potential misinterpretation by commercial interests, one would have wished that the ensuing publications might have carried an unequivocal clarification to the effect that the results should in no way be interpreted to mean that the toothpaste being tested had any cariostatic benefit whatsoever.
As a contribution to public education, this article has reiterated the solid scientific evidence base supporting lifelong twice-daily tooth cleaning with a fluoridated toothpaste for the prevention of cavities in teeth.
Hopefully, it would also trouble the conscience of self-satisfied dental professionals, their pompous organisations and others in the health sector, motivating them to resolutely pursue the goal of 100 percent population utilisation of a fluoridated toothpaste, in the grim struggle to control one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world.

Scintillating Global  Cuisine at the Kingsbury
The Kingsbury Hotel, known for some of the best drinking and dining experiences in Colombo, celebrated Mexican National Day last week by hosting the Viva Mexico Mexican food festival at its restaurant the Grill. From September 21st through the 27th, the Grill served a special a la carte menu, curated by celebrity Chef Alondra Maldonado Rodriguera and Chef Marco Valdivia.
Chef Alondra is a Gourmand Award Winner in 2014, and a delegate of the Nayarit Gastronomy by the Conservatory of Mexican Gastronomic Culture. She said she was excited to cater to Sri Lankan palates, because, Ive come to realise that in this part of the world, the spice is really in the food, and you can feel the cumin, and you can feel the cardamom.
Executive Chef Kithsiri De Silva, Celebrity Chef Alondra Maldonado, and Chef Marco Valdivia
Chef Marco, her collaborator, is the Executive Director of the restaurant Tepic, which is on the list of the top 120 restaurants in Mexico, endorsed by San Pelegrino and Culinaria Mexicana.
Together, they created a scintillating menu that felt both gourmet and comforting: We thought about what you eat at a house, not what you eat at a restaurant, explained Alondra. My thing, she continued, is to bring homemade food to restaurants. The Daily News got a preview of their culinary expertise at a food tasting last week.
For starters, Alondra served up Scallop Aguachile, a piquant chilled soup with raw scallops, onions, cilantro, and lime base marinate. The soup was the perfect palate teaser to wet an appetite for Mexican food.
It was followed by Shrimp Empanadas: corn dough stuffed, folded and fried. Unfortunately, after the soup, the empanadas tasted a little bit bland, not quite spicy enough, but extremely well cooked.The empanada had pleasing garlic flavours, and a wonderful crunchy but soft texture.
The comfort food continued with a Bean Tarasca Soup: a comforting combination of kidney beans and chili peppers that sent warmth throughout the body. It was a perfect rainy-weather dish during monsoon season. Alondras next choice was a Chicken in Almond sauce. The chicken, combined with almonds, tomatoes, onions and peppers, was delicious bathed in a sauce that had a tantalising touch of cinnamon.
Soup Aguachile
Hands down, the best savoury dish was the Pork Belly in Mustard sauce, a traditional preparation from the town Acaponeta, which Chef Marco had prepared. The sauce was creamy and pleasantly smokey, with tender pork on one side, and a cheese stuffed chili on the other. Even though stomachs were filling up fast, every plate of this dish was licked clean.
The gourmands wrapped up the food tasting with a very traditional choice for dessert: capirotada. Capirotada is served during the holy week season in Mexico. This gourmet version was a bread pudding hybrid, with walnuts, raisins, and prune pieces, that came with pumpkin and cream cheese ganache sprinkled with pomegranate seeds. The dessert was served with flare, decorated with traditional paper flags, which brought the meal full circle to true a celebration of Mexican National Day.
Along with the meal, the Grill lived up to Kingsburys reputation for fabulous drinks, with a smattering of tequila-based accompaniments, including Tequila Sunset, with Sauza Silver Tequila, pink grapefruit syrup, orange juice and grenadine syrup, and Mexican Elderflower Crush, with Sauza Silver Tequila, Cointreau, fresh lime juice, elderflower syrup and ginger ale.
With its Viva Mexico Mexican food festival, the Kingsburys Grill proved itself to be a new hot spot for scintillating global cuisine.

The Civil Aviation and Transport Ministry has decided to suspend fixing meters to three-wheelers till the standards of the three-wheel meters are ascertained by the Sri Lanka Standards Institution.
The Ministry, issuing a press release, said Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva made the above decision during a meeting with members of three-wheel drivers associations at the ministry premises, yesterday.
The Government cannot get the expected outcome if there are questions on the standards of the meters. I will ask the SLSI to look into this matter. Until the SLSI issues standard certificates to the meters, the law that makes it compulsory for all three-wheels to have meters will not be implemented, the release said quoting the minister.
The Minister was also adamant that the age limit of 35-75years to be qualified to obtain a license to drive a public service three-wheel must remain.
He pointed out that the age limit contributes to the safety of the three-wheel industry.
The minister also said that a national policy to regulate the countrys three-wheel industry has already been drafted.

Sri Lankas Trade Information Portal (TIP), the governments major initiative on cross-border trade information that complies with the World Trade Organization (WTO) has stunned world trade circles by garnering the highest validation of data accuracy so far seen on any World Bank assisted info-portal.
SLTIP was launched by the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen on July 20, 2018. Addressing the launch, Minister Bathiudeen said: With the operation of the Sri Lanka Trade Information Portal, our business community and other stakeholders will be provided with a useful tool to find the info necessary to facilitate their cross-border trade and import-export.
By its launch in 2018 July, 204 Non-Tariff Measures were identified; closely analysed and 207 related procedures were integrated. 252 forms related to procedures were identified and 269 legal documents with details of legislative background to the measures too were identified. At the time of its launch, 98.8% of the total content of SLTIP had been validated making it the highest validated TIP to be developed by the World Bank to-date. SLTIP reached a total of 10,071 visitors including 33,486 page views within the first two months of its launch, which is also the highest number of visitors attracted by any World Bank assisted Trade Information Portal. SLTIP implements ratification and notification of WTO
Sri Lankas DG Commerce Sonali Wijeratne said, TIP is part of governments multi stakeholder efforts involving an array of agencies to facilitate trade by obtaining trade related regulatory and procedural info.

Spellbound!
Meandering under the scorching sunshine, you find this house perched a cut above the rest with its window blinds. A decade ago, this very house was home to Sri Lankas music ambassador. Once inside, you naturally set sights on a framed portrait of him hung on the wall.
Daily News encounters Gayathri Khemadasa, a composer, contemporary pianist and, above all, the daughter of Maestro Premasiri Khemadasa to trace how she was inspired by her legendary father. He did not see any boundaries in music, Gayathri opens the conversation going on to add how her father wanted to offer a meaning of depth where words go silent. His music spoke in the vacuum of words. And that is exactly why the Khemadasa is still a living entity subject to distortion as well as experiment.
Father never tried to teach music to us. He discussed music with us. He let us listen to various genres of music. He wanted to hear our side of the interpretation. That was such a practical influence. When I learnt music later on that was quite useful. Most of the teachers I have met abroad did not try to cut and chop the students. They let the students unravel things for themselves. They tried to bring out the creativity in the children, Gayathri anatomises her fathers inspiration.
Gayathri Khemadasa conducting the choir for the Khemadasa Concert.
Fathers inspiration was a definite factor when Gayathri chose a career in music.
If she heard something at home, it was music. If she discussed something, that was music more than politics. The first time she felt the uniqueness of her father was when she undertook studies under local schoolteachers. There was a vast difference between the traditional teachers and her father. But it is not their fault, Gayathri is quick to add. The local schoolteachers are moulded in the traditional pedagogue whereas Premasiri Khemadasa stepped out of the boundaries.
That explains why the Maestro claimed no school. With no proper place to teach proper music, how can Khemadasa claimed to have had a teacher, questions Gayathri. Maestro Premasiri Khemadasa was someone who seems to have inherited music, though Gayathri opposes it.
What the people do not know is how my father dedicated his time to study the subject. He studied music quite a lot. As my mother tell us oftentimes, my father started his music studies in his early teens. He was never content with what he heard. He explored other possibilities of rejuvenating the same sound. He was someone who thought differently. His solitary battle as a child hailing from a not-so-wealthy family was a blessing in disguise to come a long journey in music, Gayathri breaks down the genesis of his fathers brilliance.
That brilliance will be revived with a concert to commemorate the Maestros 10th death anniversary on October 23. Named Master Khemadasa Concert  Obama Mada Viya, the event will be held at the BMICH as a collaborative effort of Kites Ads and Idea and the Khemadasa Foundation. The concert will feature melodies cherished as well as unheard for some time. A notable addition is Mathi Amathivaru penned by Vijith Gunaratne aired in the eighties banned later owing to its controversial theme.
Premasiri Khemadasa conducting the choir
The Khemadasa legacy is still alive subject to distortions and experiments. Ironically, it is distortion that happens in the name of experiments, according to Gayathri Khemadasa.
You need to know the basic structure to break the same structure. Most people try to break that structure without any knowledge of the basic structure. A song is distorted mostly because of ignorance. If you try to remove a certain element of an original score, you need to have an idea why the original musician added it in the first place. You should have a valid reason to remove it. For instance, Nanda Malinis Ammavarune is sung by different singers in a different tempo. But they do not know why my father chose Nanda Malini in particular to sing this song, Gayathri notes.
Khemadasa with his two daughters: Anupama and Gayathri
Premasiri Khemadasas originality is mostly owing to the interfusion of oriental and western music. As Gayathri puts it, the genre did not matter to her father. What mattered most was expression.
You see elements of oriental music in Manasa Vila. He never confined himself to the instruments or a particular genre. He looked for tools to suit his expression. So you get to hear instruments of both west and east in his music.
Coinciding with the concert is an photography exhibition of unknown faces to pay tribute to the memory of the maestro. Named Unheard, the exhibition features the people engaged in random acts of kindness such as feeding the stray dogs or any other charity without any publicity anticipation.
We always get to see the faces of sportsmen and artistes. But the people are made of all of us. They include these particular people engaged in noble deeds without expecting any return. My father came from the lower rung of the society. So this exhibition will be held to honour his memory, Gayathri remarks.
Step into the BMICH on October 23 and relish in the Khemadasa memory relished as Gayathri joins hands with her sister, Aupama, to bring forth an extraordinary evening.

Strauss steps down from  England cricket director role
London, Wednesday: Andrew Strauss announced on Wednesday that he is standing down as Englands director of cricket following a period of compassionate leave.
Strausss wife Ruth was diagnosed with cancer during the Ashes in December 2017 and he took a break from his position earlier this year after she began a new course of treatment.
The former Test captain, who had been in the post for three-and-a-half years, has told the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) that he will not be returning to his role. He will take on a flexible position with the governing body.
Andy Flower, who has been standing in since May, will continue to hold the reins until December while recruitment of a permanent successor takes place.
Taking time out this summer to support my wife and kids, as Ruth goes through treatment for cancer, has given me the chance to fully consider whats right for England and whats needed at home, said the 41-year-old.
The role in cricket requires total focus and commitment to deliver the best results, yet right now I need far more flexibility than could ever be possible in my position in order to support my family.
Next year is potentially the most important the game has had in this country, with the World Cup on home soil and a home Ashes series, and we have an incredible opportunity to do something special. AFP

Switzerland to  install statue of  SRI DEVI
The Switzerland authorities are planning to install a statue of veteran Indian actor Sridevi, whose super hit movie Chandni was shot at the countrys picturesque locations.
The statue of the renowned Indian filmmaker, Yash Chopra, was unveiled in Interlaken in 2016.
Many of Chopras films featured Switzerland as a backdrop and he is credited with boosting the popularity of the Alpine nation among Indian tourists. Now, considering Sridevis role in promoting tourism here, there is a proposal to honour the actor by having her statue here, a senior official familiar with the development said.
The 1989 blockbuster Chandni had also put Switzerland on centre stage as almost half the song and dance sequences in the film had a Swiss backdrop.
Raj Kapoors 1964 film Sangam was the first Indian film shot in Switzerland, which was followed by An Evening in Paris in 1967. Since then Bollywood made Switzerland their favourite shooting location paving way to cement the image of the countrys alpine scenery as a romantic paradise for Indians.
However, for many Indian tourists visiting the country today, it is Chopras 1995 production Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge that is their Swiss point of reference. Interestingly, for the tourists who happen to be cinema fanatics, there is also a provision to arrange Bollywood packaged trips here, the official said.
Sridevi, who had an illustrious career spanning over four decades, died at the age of 55 due to accidental drowning in Dubai earlier this year.

Tata Motors steps on gas as other automakers trail
Even as most car manufacturers witnessed a decline in domestic sales in September due to high fuel and product prices, Tata Motors performance was significant.
The passenger vehicles (PV) division of Tata Motors reported 7% growth in domestic sales as compared to the same period last year. All carmakers other than Maruti Suzuki and Toyota Kirloskar reported contraction in passenger vehicle sales in the latest period, from a year earlier.
Maruti Suzuki reported 0.7% growth in passenger vehicles sales, which included multi purpose vehicles and passenger cars. During the period, Maruti sold 1.4% less passenger cars as compared to the same period last year.
Hyundai reported a decline of 4.5%, while Mahindra sold 16% less passenger vehicles in the domestic market.
The domestic sales of Honda Motors were down 19%, while Ford Motors sold 6.4% less cars in India as compared with the same period last year. Toyota Kirloskar reported a growth of 1.43%.
The spectacular show by Tata Motors in September clearly indicates that the companys new generation cars are now finding buyers even in difficult times. It also gives credence to the companys submission that the turnaround plan is panning out well.
The companys PV division reported domestic sales of 18,429 units compared with 17,286 units in September last year, a 7% rise. This is the third consecutive month when sales at the passenger vehicles division grew significantly, while the industry sales shrank. The continuous strong demand for our new generation vehicles has led to this consistent month-on-month growth, Tata Motors said.
The small hatchback Tiago continues to attract new customers with the recent introduction of Tiago NRG. Tiago sales have crossed 300 units per day. SUV Nexon has been accepted well. So has Hexa. Nexon AMT and Nexon KRAZ limited edition have received an overwhelming response, witnessing good traction in the market, Tata Motors said.

UN court tells US to  ease Iran sanctions
THE NETHERLANDS: The UNs top court ordered the United States on Wednesday to lift sanctions on humanitarian goods for Iran, in a stinging rebuke for the Trump administration which nonetheless made clear the decision would change nothing.
Tehran hailed its victory after the International Court of Justice ruled that sanctions reimposed after President Donald Trump pulled out of a nuclear deal put Iranian lives at risk.
But the United States insisted it was already allowing humanitarian exemptions to sanctions and, accusing Iran of seeking a propaganda win, announced it was terminating a treaty on which the case was based.
The judges at the court in The Hague ruled unanimously that sanctions on some goods breached the 1955 Treaty of Amity between Iran and the United States that predates Irans Islamic Revolution.
They called on Washington to remove by means of its choosing any impediments arising from the measures announced on 8 May to the free exportation to Iran of medicines and medical devices, food and agricultural commodities as well as airplane parts and services, chief judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf said.
The court said sanctions on goods required for humanitarian needs... may have a serious detrimental impact on the health and lives of individuals on the territory of Iran. US sanctions also had the potential to endanger civil aviation safety in Iran. Trump slapped a first round of sanctions on Iran in August after pulling out in May from the 2015 international deal aimed at curbing Tehrans nuclear ambitions, to the dismay of his European allies. - AFP

The USD rally hurting Sri Lanka and other emerging markets
The Sri Lankan rupee in the last eight weeks has taken a beating like many other Asian currencies as a result of the dollar rally. The government rightly pointed out that many of the other currencies had taken a bigger beating .
There was unnecessary speculation that it will hit 180 by the year end, fulled largely by off hand statements made by some politicians.Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera went to the extend of advising people to buy local products and shun unnecessary imports in order to reduce the trade deficit and help stabilize a weak rupee.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who clearly knows the consequences of a prolonged FX crisis said the Government would take every measures to impose taxes to curb imports by up to $1 billion to face the currency crisis.
He should immediately start by increasing the taxes on super luxuries, starting with top end cars and set an example to stop the unnecessary oversees travel of his government officials and ministers to drive home the point that we actually have a serious crisis-that we need to manage.
On the other hand the Central Bank under pressure said they will certainly intervene aggressively to curb excess volatility in the exchange rate. Governor of the Central Bank addressing the Cyber Conference last week said during 2011/12, the former administration had invested $ 4.2 billion out of its reserves to defend the rupee. Yet, it could not prevent the depreciation of the rupee by 13.5%. Similarly, in 2015, under the present regime, the Central Bank had spent $ 1.2 billion to protect the rupee but the Rupee depreciated by 9%. So he said it is a difficult choice. Sri Lanka however today is in a critical situation because of our huge trade deficit. Exporters expect the rupee to be under pressure due to continued importer dollar demand and very will likely to play hard ball.The rupee this month alone has weakened 4.6% so far this month after a 1.2% drop last month, and is down 10% so far this year.
The US dollar rally
The dollar rose modestly on Wednesday before a widely anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate hike priced in by investors still on the edge about a trade row between the United States and China. The US Fed, hiked rates at the September meeting, as widely expected. So far most Asian markets have had a muted reaction to todays second straight quarter of dollar-supportive rate increase by the Fed.
Therefore, the dollar rally will likely to continue, that will obviously increases debt service costs in hard currency for Sri Lanka and foreign investors will look to convert their assets to USD. The other big concerns for markets has been the concern about trade wars and what that means for global growth and the rising Petroleum prices will be felt in 2019. Overall 2018 Q 4, put all these variables together: Fed tightening, dollars strength, trade wars and prospects for global growth wearing down a bit, rising oil prices - Its certainly going to be a very challenging environments for most Asian markets. Moreover high net worth Investors, especially in bond markets, are now reallocating their capital to the United States, where the yields on Treasury bonds are rising in tandem with U.S. interest rates.
Way forward
The Fed has now raised interest rates for the third time this year on Wednesday. It still foresees another rate hike in December, three more next year, and one increase in 2020. A strengthening US dollar will continue to depreciate the Rupee given that we have big dollar denominated oil imports and other dollar demands. The falling rupee suggests that monetary policy will get tightened further 2019, however being an election year the government will however have to engage in populist spending. Unfortunately for Sri Lanka unlike India that has $409 billion in foreign exchange reserves that enables it to weather any currency shocks, we have very little. Therefore the rising oil prices combined with a weakening rupee now threaten to take back the economic advantage we had gained in 16-17. Therefore, the country desperately needs to have economic growth largely led by exports and FDI to create the jobs to absorb the youth entering the job market annually and meet our external obligations.
That requires the best brains in both the government and the private sector to work together collaboratively. In the final analysis, though the USD appreciation is hurting Sri Lanka, it is a blessing in disguise for Sri Lanka to aggressively work towards increasing FDI and exports.

War Heroes as political pawns
State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene has hit out at the Joint Opposition (JO) for accusing the Government of mistreating members of the Security Forces. Speaking at a recent function he rejected JO allegations that the Government was undermining the Security Forces adding that, on the contrary, it was this Government, more than any other administration in the past, which had done much for the welfare of the Security Forces. He said that 70 percent of the pension issues of the Forces personnel have been resolved in addition to the provision of housing.
The State Minister, no doubt, was responding to the strident criticism against the government for its alleged neglect of the Security Forces personnel by the likes of Major General (Rtd.) Kamal Gunaratne who is a leading light of Eliya (Light), a movement comprising so called professionals and retired members of the Armed Forces, seen as the launching pad for the promotion of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as the next Presidential candidate from the JO.
Speaking at an event organised by Ravana Balaya, whose members act as storm troopers of the Rajapaksas, the retired Major General, while bemoaning the lack of recognition by the Government towards the sacrifices made by members of the Armed Forces, directing the attention of the audience to a group of disabled soldiers among them, added that though their physical incapacity could not be set right they will be looked after well and their lost dignity restored to them under a new government that will be a reality very soon.
Where was Major General Kamal Gunaratne who is today weeping buckets on behalf of members of the Security Forces who he claims are being stripped of their dignity and honour, when his own colleague on the battlefield the then Lt. General Sarath Fonseka was dragged away like a common criminal and thrown in the slammer after a Kangaroo Court trial read Court Martial.
One cannot also not recall the Major General rising up to assert the dignity of a group of soldiers who were protecting Fonseka, who was billeted in a Colombo hotel, following the latters defeat at the Presidential Election, when they were ordered to kneel along the hotel driveway by handpicked soldiers dispatched there by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
Nor was Major General Gunaratne anywhere to be seen when our War Heroes were forced to perform domestic chores in the homes of Rajapaksa siblings and also put on kennel duty, to indulge the whims of a Rajapaksa progeny. Perhaps the good Major General may have been vacationing abroad and cutoff from the happenings in Sri Lanka when our War Heroes were made to sell vegetables at various locations in the City and also made to do menial jobs in furtherance of Gotabhaya Rajapakas city beautification project.
Far from upholding the dignity of members of the Security Forces, the Major General stands accused of compromising our War Heroes, when, in his book Road to Nandikadal, he reveals in vivid detail alleged attacks committed by certain soldiers against residents in the North during the height of the war.
There is today no complaint by serving or retired soldiers about being neglected, ignored or shortchanged except by some disabled soldiers employed by the Rajapaksa camp to stage demonstrations on the roads or certain retired Army top brass, who once served as Ambassadors, expecting further plum posts in the event of a return to power by the Rajapaksa clan. For them, even taking legal action against members of the Security Forces for the alleged murder of journalists and carrying out white van abductions is tantamount to a witch-hunt against War Heroes.
All citizens of this country are subject to the law and members of the Security Forces are no exception. Our soldiers were engaged in a profession, that of employing their skills on the battlefield, a most noble one and one for which this nation should be ever grateful. However, that can no means be a license to commit murder and other criminal acts. Bringing such elements to justice, by no stretch of the imagination can be construed as a witch hunt against War Heroes. To do so will only be at the risk of plunging this country into lawlessness and anarchy.
In fact, as Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera explained recently, it is this Government that saved Mahinda Rajapaksa and the War Heroes from a protracted investigation by the international justice mechanisms. He recalled that when this Government came to power in January 2015, sections of the International Community had already laid the ground work to take unilateral punitive action against Sri Lanka citing accountability issues arising from the conflict. However, the Government engaged with the global community and managed to prevent any such foreign interference. This was a wise of course of action, rather than antagonizing friendly countries. Indeed, in his address to UN General Assembly last week, President Maithripala Sirisena too pointed out that Sri Lanka needs the time and space to resolve its problems domestically without undue foreign influence. Engagement, not hostility, is the way forward.

Waste plastic for road surfacing
A sustainable approach to minimize the ever-growing plastic pollution
Asset Group of Companies commenced using a new technology to incorporate waste plastic to produce asphalt for road surfacing.
Manufactured by mixing shredded plastic with aggregates, and bitumen the new asphalt mix is said to provide a number of benefits including an innovative and viable solution to address the rapidly rising plastic menace in the country as well as bringing a significant cost reduction in road paving.
The new material was tested via a pilot project, where a strip of road spanning 500 meters (with 300m of Pilot section and 200m of Control section) from Ratmalana to Borupana, was paved with the new asphalt. Prior to applying this Asphalt mix on the pilot road, lab tests were conducted to verify its performance and properties and were successfully completed.
Asset Group collects and sorts non-recyclable plastic bags from municipal waste. These are then cleaned, shredded to a permissible size and mixed with aggregates at 165C temperature, within the asphalt batching chamber.
The molten waste-plastic-mix coats the heated aggregates before being coated with bitumen. The new material waste plastic modified asphalt concrete mix will be applied for surfacing of roads under 150 C temperature. Similar waste plastic modified asphalt mixes are successfully applied to road surfacing in countries such as UK, Canada, Netherlands, Philippines, India and Indonesia. Furthermore, Sri Lankas neighbour India, under the approval of Indian Roads Congress, has applied a similar technology on approximately 3000 km of its road surfacing. he idea of applying waste plastic as an additive for road surfacing in Sri Lanka was hatched by the Asset Group in a bid to combat the rapidly growing issue of plastic pollution. At present, the global Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generation levels have reached nearly 1.3 billion tonnes per year, while its expected to hit a projected 2.2 billion tonnes per year by 2025. Considering the local context, Sri Lankas MSW has reached 6500  7000 tonnes per day by 2015. Regrettably, 60% of this waste has been contributed by the Western Province. Moreover, Sri Lanka generates 794 tonnes of plastic waste per day.
The gravity of the situation can be gauged when considering the fact that it takes 400-500 years for the plastic to completely disintegrate.
Therefore, when non-biodegradable plastic ends up in landfills, it pollutes both air and water, while causing fatality to fauna and avifauna, forcing the vulnerable species towards extinction.
Asset Groups new asphalt mix will not only address the plastic issue plaguing the country, but also helps to greatly reduce the cost of road construction by making the asphalt pavements more durable.
At present, the technology has already become an internationally accepted practice, and by adopting the same in Sri Lanka, Asset Group believes that it would make a significant impact in the road construction sector, while becoming a catalyst for environmental sustainability in the long run.

When you workout, glycogen (glucose stored in muscles) is used up as a source of energy.
The repeated contraction of the muscles also leads to muscle fiber wear and tear. Thats why, right after working out, your muscles feel weak, and you feel like resting for a while. Its your bodys way of telling you that you have no energy and need to refuel. This is precisely why you need to eat after working out. The nutrients from the good foods will help in the following ways:

Dark Leafy Greens 
Dark leafy greens like kale, spinach, radish greens, Swiss chard, lettuce, broccoli, collard greens, mustard greens, and arugula are loaded with dietary fiber, vitamins C, A, E, and K, magnesium, calcium, potassium, and other phytonutrients. These will not only help you replenish the glycogen stores but also protect you from a host of diseases, aid weight loss, and boost your immunity.

Oatmeal 
Oats are popular among those who want to lose weight. But did you know that the good carbs present in oats also make them an amazing post-workout food, especially if you make oats smoothie Loaded with vitamin E, antioxidants, and other phytonutrients, oats help increase satiety, lower bad cholesterol, and also fight cancer.

Fruits and veggies 
Fruits and veggies like apple, banana, pear, peach, plum, watermelon, muskmelon, dragon fruit, passion fruit, carrot, tomato, beetroot, scallions, and peas are great for your post-workout meal. And thats because they help boost your energy levels and flush out the toxic free oxygen radicals. They also help fight heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and certain types of cancer. The WHO recommends consuming 4 to 5 types of fruits and veggies per day. You can easily blend a banana, spinach, and carrot to make a quick post-workout meal.

Sweet potato
Sweet potato is the best substitute for white potato. It is low in calories, great for replenishing the glycogen stores, and keeps you satiated for a long duration. This instant energy source also has cancer-fighting potential, helps in weight loss, and flushes out toxins from the body. If you are on a weight loss mission, have boiled sweet potatoes instead of the baked ones as baking causes a spike in the GI of sweet potatoes.

Eggs 
Like rice, eggs have quite a mixed reputation. Many people prefer eating only the white because they do not like the texture of the yolk or it smells odd. But many healthy eaters avoid having the yolk as they consider it to be unhealthy. However, that is not true. Whole eggs are excellent sources of water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, and most importantly, essential amino acids and proteins. They are great for your post-workout meal as they are loaded with proteins and other nutrients that help protect you from various diseases. Having 2 whole eggs per day is ideal. Do not exceed the limit of 4to 5 eggs per week.

Cottage cheese 
Cottage cheese is a milk product that is enjoyed in salads, wraps, pizzas, and sandwiches. It is a good source of protein, calcium, and other nutrients that help increase the satiety levels. Some commercially available cottage cheese is also fortified with vitamin D, an essential nutrient for overall well-being. You can have it with a few slices of avocado and a slice of whole wheat bread for your post-workout meal to rev up your energy levels and help your muscles recover from the wear and tear quickly.

Greek yogurt 
Greek yogurt contains more protein than regular yogurt and helps improve satiety levels. It is one of the best snacks, and consuming it post your workout is a great way to keep your hunger pangs in control for an hour or so. You can add it to smoothies or have it with some fruits.

Tuna 
Tuna is a great source of protein and healthy fats. One ounce of canned tuna contains about 7.1 g of protein and 78.7 mg of omega-3 fatty acids. It also contains a selenium-containing compound, selenoneine. It helps protect the hemoglobin and myoglobin from oxidation and also helps decrease mercury toxicity.
Consume a piece of fish with some dark leafy greens and some healthy fats for a filling and yummy post-workout meal. Style Craze

When opportunity knocked 20 years ago
Four things come not back -- the spoken word, the sped arrow, the past life, and the neglected opportunity
-Arabian Proverb
In October 1998, exactly twenty years ago, trade chambers and Sri Lankas top corporate sector leaders in a unique move jointly requested the then government of Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and the opposition led by Ranil Wickremasinghe to rise above party divisions to formulate an economic policy and a feasible solution to ethnic crisis to boost the countrys economy. The business leaders felt that Sri Lanka had not achieved the preferred level of economic progress even after economy was opened two decades ago.
Armyne Wirasingha, Patrick Amarasinghe, Lalith Kotelawala, Ken Balendra, Nimal Samarakkody and Nigel Austin were signatories to the appeal that spelt out a formula of ten points.
The ten-point formula
Ensuring parity for all citizens irrespective of religion, race, gender, political connections. North-East conflict resolution to be given priority. Peace and security for all citizens. Official language status to English as a link language. An independent Public Service Commission, Police and Judicial Service Commission. Prior to legislation public debates through white papers published on all important vital issues. A sustainable set policies on (a) Trade and Commerce, (b) Agriculture, (c) Industry and (d) Foreign to remain unaffected for 15 years, which if necessary would change only on mutual agreement by both the government and the Opposition. Reformed Labour Laws introduced (with emphasis on:- Flexibility in labour market, rights and obligations of employees and employers, cut in the number of holidays, productivity linked remuneration system) Educational reforms. National economic plans formulated in consultation with the Chambers of Commerce and industry, trade associations, and employers organisations.
The areas listed by the corporate leaders are topics of any partys concern. They would initially meet President and Opposition Leader separately for talks on the current political and socio-economic situation, before bringing both President Kumaratunga and UNP leader Wickremesinghe together.
The UNP in the previous month summoned an all party conference to discuss fresh procedures for conducting free and fair elections which Minister G L Peiris, of the government undermined.
But whether the two leaders would agree to come on a common platform is another matter. Many small political parties have responded positively to the initiative by the top business leaders strategy to resolve ethnic and other problems. The entrepreneurs were optimistic at the end of the first session of dialogue and expressed hope they could convince the UNP leader to join. However, CBKs scathing attack on Opposition who were contemplating on whether to join or not hindered the progress at the very beginning. The business communitys main objective was to make the two big political parties to work together on a common programme.
The opposition was suspicious of the move thinking the business communitys idea was a trap by the government in conspiracy with some vested interests. The UNP in a letter addressed to the business leaders said:
the North-East issue is the main disaster that faces the country today, therefore we agree to Presidents request to accept a bi-partisan approach to it. Regretfully, the government has not acted on this matter. The situation in the North-East continues to worsen. A humanitarian crisis in both the areas of the Wanni, needing imperative consideration is the hunger and malnourishment faced by the people. We would appeal you to make this a topic of priority in your negotiations with the government and help avert the loss of lives. Wishing your programme every success
 Sgd. Gamini Atukorale
General Secretary-UNP
Blame game and talks fail
Briefed by Lalith Kotelawala on the action plan, and Armyne Weerasinghe explaining them, the then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga highly praised the corporate Chairmen for taking the initiative. She analysed the then political situation and how it came about. She blamed the UNP for delaying tactics; said her government wanted to finish the war quickly and introduce constitutional reforms for power devolution, but the process was stuck due to oppositions attitude. UNP is responsible for delaying the process, she told the corporate Chairmen, we need only 16 votes for the required 2/3 majority she grieved prompting a member of the delegation to warn the President against harassment on the UNP and its leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The war is escalating, she said, It is important that we find a lasting solution to the matter early, I want the opposition to join hands with governments to make this a success. It is a joint effort I dont want personal credit. she said. She then requested the business leaders to keep RW informed of what emerged at the meeting.
Lalith Kotelawala, Soon after the meeting telephoned Ranil Wickremesinghe and briefed him on the latest developments and wanted to meet him for discussions, who summoned them to his residence immediately. Wickremesinghe expressed approval on what had happened but lamented it was too late, that the UNPs choice to stay out of it has already been taken by the Parliamentary Group and endorsed by Exco. However, the opposition leader gave an assurance that he would be available the next day to further discuss the issue. Commending the private sectors initiative to take up national economic issues he said, We have to disregard the past.
The business leaders maintained mum and did not give up hopes. In the meantime, on the very next day, a scathing attack by CBK on the UNP at a public meeting created irrecoverable harm to peace talks, and a serious problem for the corporate leaders. They lost even the little space available to them for negotiation with the UNP about an All Party Conference.
Current economic crisesand stark reality
One of the reasons that caused the current economic crises could result from the rejection of the Corporate Sector Formula by the two major political parties two decades ago. Today we are facing an unparalleled calamity that began in the Rajapaksa era and accelerated by effects of Trumps decision to raise the American interest rates further burdened by the effects of the neo-liberal policies of J. R. Jayewardene.
The efforts of Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera to increase the ratio of Direct taxes against indirect, reversing the trend set during JRJ and continued by successive governments, should be praised. The indirect tax today stands at 85% of the total state revenue. JR reduced direct income tax to the minimum. All these resulted in a plunge of state revenue from relative to GDP by 2014, leaving all the FMs thereafter to seek to minimize the budget shortfall through debt. The indirect tax was the worst feature of neo-liberal economic principals; it replaced the burden of tax from the rich to the masses. Failure by all regimes in the past 40 years are responsible for not developing the industrial sector, the Premadasa rule being the exception. The rupee which stood at Rs 8 for a $ US had depreciated over the past 40 years, under administrations of JR, CBK, MR and the present, all following open/liberal economies to Rs 170.
Any major economic crisis or ethnic problems cannot be effectively solved but for the political parties agree on a course of co-operation rather than conflict, it is a stark reality.

Whoever plays the conditions well will win - Morgan
Win over England will be a morale-booster for World Cup - Chandimal
An England team has seldom toured Sri Lanka being on top of their game. But the one-day side that Eoin Morgan leads for the upcoming five-match ODI series starting in Dambulla on October 10 is certainly one of the strongest today and their status is justified by their no. 1 ranking.
However as Morgan pointed out being no. 1 is an acknowledgement of the progress the team has made this year, but their main focus is the World Cup next year where England are the host.
To become no. 1 is a nice acknowledgement its not something that we have set our focus on. Our focus is the World Cup next year. Focussing on the actual process that got us there and not becoming no.1 is the most important thing, said Morgan.
England are one of the few countries that has never won the World Cup despite having hosted the mega event on four occasions. The current England side represents their best chance of laying their hands on that coveted trophy.
As Morgan explained it has been a long process to get to where they are today. Its been a long process, well thought out and well planned and to a point well executed. Weve still a long way to go and its taken us 3 years to get to where we are now, said Morgan. We are getting to the most important part of what we been planning towards where the players have done an exceptional job, jelled well as a team and gone in the way that weve wanted.
LANKAN PITCHES NOT ALIEN
Morgan disagreed that conditions and pitches in Sri Lanka are going to be totally alien to them as they have been in the past.
Everywhere we play and every ground we play presents different challenges. I disagree that conditions are going to be totally alien because throughout our summer the ball turned at home which doesnt normally happen, said Morgan.
We are also trying to play to our game plan. Around the world presents different pressures and different challenges within our group. Its something over the last few years weve done well as a team and its helped with the growth of the side. Last winter away against New Zealand and Australia we played in all types of conditions some extremely tough and some we felt at home. I think Sri Lanka will present chances like that, he said.
Morgan who was part of the England side that toured Sri Lanka in 2014 and lost the seven-match ODI series 5-2 said that the present Lankan team presented a different challenge to the one they played back in 2014 where Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene laid the foundation for their win. Depending on how the conditions turn out whoever plays the conditions well will win, said Morgan.
CHANDIMAL OPTIMISTIC
Sri Lankas one-day captain Dinesh Chandimal was optimistic about his teams chances against England.
England are on top of the one-day rankings because they are a very good side. The series presents a good challenge for us. If we can finish on the winning side it will be a good morale booster before we go for the World Cup, said Chandimal.
All the players are focussed on their job at hand. If we can obtain the results that we are looking forward to at the end of the series it will be a tremendous boost to our confidence, he said.
Sri Lanka are currently going through a phase where their one-day stocks are below par which is reflected in their recent debacle in the Asia Cup where they were beaten comprehensively by Bangladesh and fast rising Afghanistan and by their current ranking at 8.
We are going through a process of where we have gone wrong in ODI cricket. We have identified certain areas where we have gone wrong, there are a few more areas we have to rectify.
We need the players to perform according to match situation which is what we have been unable to do. We have a good coach and a good management and as players we should know in the middle how we should perform. If we can do that we can give a good contest to England, Chandimal said.
DIFFERENT CHALLENGE TO ASIA CUP
Sri Lankas under pressure head coach Chandika Hathurusingha said the England series was a big challenge and added, It is always good to measure yourself with the best. At the end of the series we will know where we are at this stage looking towards the World Cup.
We have prepared like we normally do for any other series. We have been practicing for about a week and we are going to Dambulla on the October 5th ahead of the matches to get used to the pitches and conditions because there are different, said Hathurusingha.
We prepared as well as we could for the Asia Cup but we didnt go and execute those plans. We didnt perform as expected and we accept that. The challenge posed here is quite different to what we got during the Asia Cup.
We have not taken much from the Asia Cup only certain things because conditions and opposition is going to be different.
But overall our development we have taken some measures. It is not particularly of what happened there. We are particular about the opposition that we are facing this time, he said.

PCoI probing alleged malpractices at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka
Witness questioned about SriLankan Airlines call centre established in 2010
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) appointed to investigate irregularities at SriLankan Airlines (SLA), SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka yesterday questioned the General Manager of Commercial and Support Services Duminda Weeraratne on issues relating to the SLA call centre which was established in 2010.
The SLA customer services were conducted by its Telephone Sales Operation Unit from 1990. But in 2009, the SLA called for bids from the venders to set up a fully outsourced call centre for three years. Apart from boosting its service excellence, the SLA also expected a 50 percent reduction of staff of the call centre within the three years period. It was also expected to save an amount of Rs. 77 Million of the cost of the call centre after three years.
When questioned, the witness told the Commission that he is unaware as to whether there was a decision from the senior management to set up a call centre outsourcing the services.
He said but, a Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) was appointed for that purpose and he was also a member of it. According to his knowledge, no feasibility study has also been carried out in this regard. It was also revealed that there was no such requirement to set up call centre in the SLA Strategic Business Plan (SBP) prepared for the financial years 2010/11 to 2014/15.
However, the TEC had developed a Request for Proposal (RFP) to select a service provider that has local and international experience. Upon receiving, 10 venders had responded to this RFP.
Later, the TEC based on five key areas of the RFP has shortlisted five venders at the first round. Before the second round, the TEC members had visited the Emirates call center and also had a video conference to study the Etihad call center. After that, at the second round, the selected companies were further shortlisted based on a revised implementation plans and finally, two companies namely HelloCorp Pvt. Ltd. and Scicom Lanka Pvt. Ltd. had got higher marks.
These revised plans are not in the RFP, the witness told the commission. Later, the HelloCorp teamed up with an Indian Company IGT and the Scicom teamed up with a local company Just-in-Time as their ICT service providers.
According to the witness, the Scicom Company is an internationally recognised one for such services, but only in low-cost carriers such as AirAsia.
The low-cost carriers have no complexity that airlines like SriLankan have, he added. But, the HelloCorp has expertise in classic travelling and cargo services. The cost of HelloCorp for the three-year period which they agreed at the financial negotiation was Rs. 473 million and the cost of the Scicom was only Rs. 445 Million.
However, despite the cost which is higher than six percent to the Scicom, the contract has been granted to the HelloCorp in the year 2009 on the merit basis.
The main duty of the selected service provider was to maintain Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and the Customers Satisfaction. The witness told that despite of outsourcing, the SLA had some control of the call center in terms of quality.
When asked, whether there was an expected reduction of staff after three years, the witness told that there was no conclusion as to how the reduction came about and also he has no details to say whether it was successful. He said he couldnt find documents to prove whether the anticipated cost of Rs.77 million could be saved as well.
The Commission also inquired from him regarding an addendum dated July 15, 2013 attached to the original agreement which mentions about paying incentives to the staff which was not in the RFP. It has been signed by the Chief Marketing Officer pf SLA and the CEO of the HelloCorp to grant incentives for the staff from March 1, 2012.
The witness said that he couldnt find any document to prove whether the approval of the Board of Directors has been granted for this addendum. The procurement Manual of the SLA also has not been followed in granting these incentives, it was revealed. Another addendum to the original agreement had further advanced the date of paying incentives to the staff till October 1, 2011.
The Commission also inquired about paying an additional payment of Rs.185,000 per month for the Full Time Employees, who are fluent in Mandarin. He said that he didnt know on which basis they were paid this amount and it was also not in the TEC report.But, according to him, this should be due to the business requirement which had arisen at that time. The Chief Marketing Officer had signed to authorise this payment.
It was also revealed before the Commission that the fully outsourced call centre was physically set up in September 2009. But, the contract agreement between HelloCorp and the SLA had been signed on June 16, 2011 about 10 months after the setting up of the call center. He said that he couldnt find even a contract review for this agreement.
The agreement with HelloCorp was concluded in September 2013 after three years. However, according to the provisions of the agreement in 2013, the agreement had been extended for a period of another three years. He said that he could not find any details whether any evaluation was carried out before the renewal of the agreement, but, the approval of the Board of Directors was received for that.
