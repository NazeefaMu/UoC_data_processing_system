'The Angry Birds Movie' introduces the adorable Hatchlings

An animated movie these days just isn't complete without some cute baby characters, and 'The Angry Birds Movie' is no exception. Rovio and Sony Pictures have debuted our first look at the the adorable Hatchlings as they (attempt to) sing "Deck the Halls". t
The main trio of Angry Birds will be led by Jason Sudeikis as Red, a bird with a temper, with Josh Gad as the speedy Chuck, and Danny McBride voicing the volatile Bomb.
Supporting them are Bill Hader as a pig, Maya Rudolph as Matilda, and Peter Dinklage as the Mighty Eagle. Also lending their voices to the video game adaptation are Keegan-Michael Key, Kate McKinnon, Tony Hale, Ike Barinholtz, Hannibal Buress, Cristela Alonzo, Jillian Bell, Danielle Brooks, singer Romeo Santos and YouTube stars Smosh.
"The question Rovio gets more than anything is 'Why are these birds so angry'," producer John Cohen (Despicable Me) said previously. "This is the origin story for how that conflict came to exist between birds and little green piggies." In its various formats, the 'Angry Birds' game has been downloaded over two billion times as of this year, with an animated series 'Angry Birds Toons' that has collectively tallied three-billion views on numerous platforms. Written by 'The Simpsons' alum Jon Vitti and directed by Fergal Reilly and Clay Kaytis, 'The Angry Birds Movie' is set to debut in the US on May 20, 2016.

Big in action, small in originality

Based on William Joyce's book 'The Leaf Men And The Brave Good Bugs' Chris Wedge brings the novel into 3D as 'Epic' in an entertaining and unique manner.
This forest-set fantasy opens with teenager Mary Katherine aka M K visiting her scientist father to rekindle the father-daughter bond. However she soon discovers that he has no time for her since he is obsessed with finding an advanced race of tiny men who live in the forest. Disappointed M K decides to leave home when she is suddenly shrunk down to insect size. She encounters the wee forest folk that her father has been searching for through the years.
Meantime the little folk are faced with problems of their own when the evil Mandrake and his gang spread rot and life-sucking substances into the forest. Traveling to a pond to choose a pod that will spawn her heir, the leafmen's leader, Queen Tara, is carried by a flock of dragonflies in a leaf-like ship, which gorgeously unfolds into a water lily when it hits the pond's surface. Talking mushrooms, flowers, and insects are everywhere. Two insects a snail and a slug named Mub and grub provide humour to the tale. Ozzie, M.K.'s blind, three-legged, lovable pug too adds a smile to our faces during his ventures. M K is brought to this set up with a reason. She must help the forest folk keep the Earth's ecosystem working.
Heroine centric
Some of the scenes from 'Epic' remind you of those from movies like 'The Wizard of Oz','Honey, I Shrunk the Kids', 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Avatar'. Therefore the movie is big in its action but small in originality. The scenes in which the evil forces battle with the good remind us strongly of the orcas in 'The Lord of the Rings'. At times the plot is confusing since so many characters make it to the scene.
However the movie is heroine centric since the two main characters which lead the troupes, Queen Tara and M K - forest dweller and human being - are female.
Epic is a green themed flick that follows along the footsteps of 'The Lorax'. It has a simple yet powerful theme. Throughout the movie the underlying message that one should never lose hope since the tables can turn is highlighted. It is also a coming of age production for characters like Nod. The visuals are stunning and the backdrop where the action takes place is busy. The film is astonishing in its 3D effects but could have been equally enthralling without them. Wedge's expertise in the 'Ice Age' franchise has helped him in presenting this visual treat for animation fans. It is also fascinating to look at the world through the leafmen's eyes.
Smart move
The voice cast has some of the top names in the business among them. Amanda Seyfried, Josh Hutcherson, Colin Farrell, Christoph Waltz, Beyonc Knowles, Pitbull, Steven Tyler and Jason Sudeikis have lent their voices for 'Epic'. It is a smart move by the team to hire big names like Knowles to voice Queen Tara, a miniature Mother Nature, since this too will enhance the fans' interest towards 'Epic.'However the team has made little use of her vocal skills.
'Epic' is sure to win the hearts of everyone who are into animation movies. It provides pint-sized thrills in wit and charm for the whole family.

Disgraced ex-chief of Russia's anti-doping agency dies

Moscou, Monday: The former head of Russia's anti-doping agency RUSADA, Nikita Kamayev, who resigned last year over scandalous allegations of state-sanctioned doping, has died suddenly, the agency said Monday.
"The RUSADA former executive director died suddenly at the age of 52," RUSADA said in a statement. "The cause is presumed to be a massive heart attack."
"It is a great loss and unexpected for us," the Russian anti-doping agency's interim general director Anna Antseliovich, who took charge after the scandal, told R-Sport news agency.
Kamayev, who resigned as RUSADA's executive director in December, died after feeling ill while skiing, the former general director of the anti-doping agency, Ramil Khabriyev told TASS news agency earlier Monday.
He had said Kamayev's age was 50.
"I never heard before that he had heart problems. Maybe his wife knew about some problems," Khabriyev said.
Kamayev had resigned along with three other RUSADA top officials after a report by a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) independent commission accused Russia of routine violations of testing standards and allowing suspended athletes to compete.
Both RUSADA and Moscow's anti-doping laboratory were suspended over the bombshell report.
RUSADA in its statement praised Kamayev as "an experienced and understanding manager" who "managed to create a friendly atmosphere among staff".
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said Kamayev "stood at the origins of the anti-doping organisation in Russia, he created it".
"We greatly regret his death," he added.
The officials resigned after President Vladimir Putin called for Russian officials, trainers and athletes to take responsibility for engaging in or abetting doping.
Kamayev had served as RUSADA's acting director since 2011.
His death came as inspectors from the world athletics' governing body IAAF were due to start a two-day visit to Russia to evaluate anti-doping efforts following a ban for Russian athletes from international competition over the claims.
Kamayev had initially responded defiantly to the WADA report released in November, branding the suspension of Moscow's anti-doping laboratory "utter nonsense" and ridiculing the allegations as reminiscent of "the epoch of James Bond."
"I have a holster, a pistol, and every day I go to the basements of Lubyanka," he scoffed to journalists in November, using the informal name for the KGB/FSB security service headquarters building in central Moscow. AFP

Entire Parliament transformed into government: PM

The proposed new sectoral oversight committees to be set up in Parliament should have powers to summon not only officials but also Provincial Chief Ministers and Provincial Ministers, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said this delivering the keynote address at the inauguration of a three day workshop on oversight committees attended by Parliamentarians at Committee Room 1 of the Kotte Parliamentary Complex yesterday. A delegation of UK Parliamentarians led by Labour Party MP Fiona Mctaggart is also attending the workshop.
The Prime Minister said the government had taken steps to transform the entire Parliament into a government.
There was only a single committee in the Westminster System of government in Britain and that was the Cabinet which took policy decisions and Members of Parliament were the section which represented the people. The other committee system was in the United States where it operated to impose limitations on Presidential powers, he said.
The Prime Minister said Members of Parliament were the section which represented the people. Some of them function as ministers and deputy ministers. But actually the backbenchers had no functions to perform, the Prime Minister said. Making some of the Parliamentarians as ministers and deputy ministers and relegating others to the backbenches without any work was unjustifiable. As time passes only ministers and officials become the main performers of work. But this work should be handed over to Parliament to make it the Chief Centre of Governance, he said.
The Prime Minister said Parliament had control over public finance.
"The President or the Cabinet of Ministers had no powers to control public finance. We should strive to further strengthen this power of Parliament. Party polices had a say in the adoption of the Budget. There are the COPE and Public Accounts Committees. What they do was to review expenditure and see whether such expenditure was correct or wrong," he said.
"This could be likened to the system in a funeral parlour where you go and see a body after embalming it and express your sympathy after the work is done. I have seen officials in certain areas taking action disregarding the law. Some officials acted in a manner that caused injustice to women and minorities. If you look at the CEB they spend more funds for their own regions or areas," Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Former President D.B. Wijetunga earlier held portfolios of Posts and Telecommunications, Power, Agriculture and Finance. What more did one need to look after and cater to an electorate he asked.
The Prime Minister said the workshop was aimed to explain the working of the oversight committees. Chairmen of these committees would not be ministers. Ministers too should have attended this workshop. If not this would create unneccessary problems and laws should be amended to give over powers to the MPs as well, he said.

Govt's meagre relief insufficient for ordinary

A multitude of the ordinary public are today complaining that life is like a torch burning at both ends. Farmers especially are saying that they would have to die in hunger soon as all public relief has been curtailed by the government, Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara said.
Addressing a press conference held by the Socialist Janatha Peramuna at the Rajagiriya Dr. N. M. Perera Memorial Hall, yesterday Nanayakkara said public were lamenting that the paddy purchasing exercise had almost come to a near standstill and farmers were not receiving fertilizer at the subsidized price since the fertilizer sales had been handed over to the private sector.
The meagre relief offered to farmers today were insufficient to keep them in the agriculture industry. He said that during his visit to Medabadda and Kaltota he saw some of the rooms earlier used for stocking paddy given over to conduct vocational training classes. The paddy purchasing in those areas had ceased because there were no storage facilities available. This might be a ruse adopted by the government to wean the farmers away from their agricultural pursuits, the parliamentarian said. Nanayakkara said a similar fate had befallen rubber cultivators. Certain rubber small holders had ceased tapping. While larger rubber estates had limited tapping for 10 days a month.
The tea industry too was facing a state of depression as the price of green leaf had plummeted to Rs. 54 or Rs. 55 per kilo. This shows that income levels of people had fallen to great depths while the expenses involved had increased to unbearable levels.

Indias Dhoni backs Pietersen for IPL

New Delhi, Monday: Indian skipper MS Dhoni on Monday backed big-hitting batsman Kevin Pietersen for the upcoming Indian Premier League, saying he expects no discipline problems from the controversial ex-England captain.
New franchise the Rising Pune Supergiants bought Pietersen for $514,500 at a player auction for the next edition of the glitzy Twenty20 tournament starting in April.
Dhoni said his fellow teammate would be a great asset to the Supergiants who are making their debut at the IPL, replacing one of two teams barred over a corruption scandal that engulfed the tournament's 2013 edition.
Pietersen has been banished from the England team since the Ashes tour disaster in 2014, over several discipline issues. In 2009 Pietersen was forced to resign as captain after a fallout with coach Peter Moores, who was later sacked.
"Again, you know people are often judged by what comes in the media, but when you actually meet them they are totally different. I don't think there will be any issue with discipline," Dhoni said at an IPL promotional event in Delhi.
"As I said, KP is a fantastic player, someone who is very aggressive and at the same time very expressive on the field. It is good to have him in the side," he said.
The 35-year-old Pietersen has played in previous IPLs and has been in recent excellent form in South Africa's Ram Slam competition and Australia's Big Bash League.
Dhoni said younger players in the Pune team can learn from Pietersen's experience that includes 104 Tests and 136 one-day internationals during his decade-long career.
Dhoni said he was also keen to reunite with former New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming after he was hired by Pune as head coach.

Matale Thomians force a draw

A classic knock of 106 by skipper Pandula Udupihilla helped St. Thomas College, Matale to force a draw in their inter school match against Jaffna Central College, concluded at the Thomian grounds, Matale on Saturday.
It was some weak kneed batting in the first innings by the Matale Thomians which resulted a poor total and were asked to follow on in their territory by a Jaffna School.
But in the second innings the Thomian batting clicked and they ran up a huge 313 for nine declared in just 60 overs compelling the Jaffna Centralities to bat again and save the match.
Thomian skipper Pandula Udupihilla led the recovery by blasting 106 hitting 3 sixers and 13 fours. He was well supported by Dilashan Jayamaha who cracked a blistering 83 in 72 balls hitting 5 sixers and 6 fours. This pair put on 153 for the third wicket. Pandula Udupihilla has now scored 600 runs and taken 60 wickets.
The visiting team were set a victory target of 214 and were 168 for 6 when stumps were drawn.
In the first innings last three Thomian wickets fell at the same total while Jaffna Centrals last pair added 41 runs taking the score from 159 for 9 to 210 all. This major impact in the Thomians conceding a one run first innings lead and asked to follow on.

MR ceded SLFP chairmanship to Prez to save Namal, Shiranthi et al: SB

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa decided to hand over the chairmanship of the SLFP to President Maithripala Sirisena to save Namal Rajapaksa, Shiranthi Rajapaksa et al. But the issue related to Namal Rajapaksa cannot be revealed, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B.Dissanayake said.
Addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday, he said that they did not wish for a possible future arrest of MP Namal Rajapaksa.
We regret about the arrest of Yoshitha Rajapaksa but we regret more about allowing children to get involved in large scale businesses. The entire country knows that Yoshitha Rajapaksa handled the business. Persons who invested in this business say that the money they invested is not theirs.
It is similar to the case of the big house and land located in Kaduwela, Dissanayake said.
Basil Rajapaksa says it is not one of his properties and Chamal Rajapaksa says he has no idea about it. The house and the land is under the Mahinda Rajapaksa Foundation which is headed by Chamal Rajapaksa, he said.
Sri Lanka needs a special unit like the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) that should function under the Police Department but the country should not see it as a political institution. In the past it was revealed that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa deposited some funds, which was received as aid for the Tsunami disaster victims, into his personal account . Now the same judge who blamed himself for giving a judgement in favour of the former President is supporting him [Mahinda Rajapaksa], he added.
Former State Minister Hemal Gunasekara said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was compelled to hand over the chairmanship of the SLFP to President Sirisena after a discussion held at the former Speakers house with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena, former President Rajapaksa, Shiranthi Rajapaksa and MP Namal Rajapaksa.
I helped the former President to get nominations for the previous general election on a request by Shiranthi Rajapaksa. I know the former President very well because we attended the same school and my father assisted him to obtain employment at Vidyodaya University Library. My father was the Registrar of the university at that time. The former President is a very grateful person and he will never divide the SLFP. He will learn his mistake and come into the right path shortly, the former state minister said.

SB dares organisers of Negombo meeting to provide attendees list

Social Empowerment Minister S. B. Dissanayake yesterday challenged the organisers of the former Local Councillors', meeting held in Negombo to provide the name list of the so called 1,401 who are said to have attended the meeting adding that only 750 were present and of them some 200 were defeated candidates.
Addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday he said only 551 members out of the total 1,447 turned up for this meeting. A total of 33 former members from the Hambantota district did not turn up for the meeting. All seven MPs in the Polonnaruwa district are with President Maithripala Sirisena. "We regret about the efforts made to mislead the country".
According to Minister Dissanayake no decision has been taken to hold disciplinary inquiries against those who took part at the Negombo meeting but disciplinary inquires will be held against 10 persons named before. "Our aim is keeping the SLFP without being divided. If there will be a division, the SLFP will present excellent, educated candidates in contrast to the persons to be presented by the other side such as 'Udeni' who was caught by the Bribery and Corruption Commission while counting money received as a bribe."
Minister Dissanayake pointed out that the two articles of the SLFP Constitution amended by former President Rajapaksa to attack former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumarathunga boomeranged on him. That is how he had to step down from the Presidency of the SLFP. He totally destroyed the SLFP's minority vote base.
University Education Minister Mohan Lal Grero said that now he can carry out more work than before because he is working with Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella. "Some in both sides are dragging this government in two different sides.
Sri Lanka has received a golden opportunity to prove to the world that we are not guilty as stated by certain elements such as Channel 4. The SLFP will not be able to win an election even in 2020 without the support of the minority communities."

Team Honda crowned champions once again

Being crowned the CEAT-SLADA Motorcycles Champion Team of 2015, Team Honda has regained the title it held in 2013, the Team's debut year in motocross competition. At the scintillating end-of-season awards ceremony late November, Team Honda was presented with the prestigious Championship trophy.
To win the National Team Championship twice in three years is outstanding. Beginning the season with the firm decision to re-take the crown, Team Honda riders and technicians ably backed and co-ordinated by Stafford Motor Company (Pvt) Limited remained totally focused on winning the 2015 title.
Gayan Sandaruwan nine times the National 250cc Champion Motocross Rider and brother Shanuka Sandaruwan himself a three time National Champion (2010 - Under 16 age category; 2012 and 2013 - Group M 250cc Standard/Modified), and Team Honda rookies Ima lManchanayake and Kasun Wickramarachchi, all Honda CRF250-mounted, formed the 'front office' of Team Honda 2015. Gayan used the 2015 season to return to competition following a pre-season crash injury, competing at a single meet. KasunWikramarachchi had to put his 2015 motocross campaign on hold following injury sustained at Fox Hill, the season opener.

There are no saints in politics: SB

There are no saints when it comes to crossing over, breaking political parties and establishing new political parties, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B.Dissanayake said.
"I did it myself, the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa snatched the SLFP in the past, along with late Anura Bandaranaike and Maithripala Senanayake. I also received a position of an'organiser' at that time," he said.
He was addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday, where he also said the former President who had now resorted to calling others 'frogs', had forgotten how he snatched at the SLFP in the past and how the elderly leaders of the SLFP died with the mental agony inflicted on them by defeat.
There is no one who remained in his or her political party for ever. Majority of them have crossed over, broken their parties or established new political parties, the minister said. He added however, "But at the end all of them returned to their original political party. No new political party survived."
Minister Dissanayake said that what is wanted is to unite the SLFP and stop it from breaking into two. "We do not need to spoil the relationship with anyone. We vehemently reject the efforts made to push the country back to racism. All the issues, especially the war occurred because the past governments prevented the minorities from joining the administration and ruling of the country," the minister said.
He pointed out that he had recently been accuse of cutting Rs. 100 from the payment granted for the elderly by the government. But that Rs. 100 goes to a large fund which upgrades elders homes, which are like hell with no facilities and dirty and unhealthy environments., he said. He also said a system would be established soon to make payment for elders at their homes via easy cash.
Then they can save Rs. 200 or 300 they spent for three wheelers to travel to the post office or other institution to obtain the payment, he said.

Ticket prices reduced for FA Cup's showpiece matches

London, Monday: The English Football Association on Monday responded to the growing controversy over ticket prices by reducing the cost of attending the FA Cup final and semi-finals.
The FA have decided to cut all ticket prices by 5 ($7, 6 euros), meaning the cost of attending the final at Wembley on May 21 will start at 45, excluding concessions, while entry prices for the two semi-finals at Wembley in April will begin at 30. A statement from the FA read: "Following discussions led by chief executive Martin Glenn, The FA today confirms that ticket prices for the 2016 Emirates FA Cup final at Wembley have been reduced by 5 across all price points."In addition, tickets for this year's semi-final matches revert back to 2014 prices.
"So far, this season's competition has seen attendances close to two million and 13m distributed to clubs across the football pyramid. "The FA is in a good financial position and lowering the cost of these showpiece matches is in recognition of the strong, continued commitment from fans supporting the world's original cup competition."
The subject of ticket prices has been much debated in recent weeks after Liverpool fans walked out of their draw with Sunderland earlier this month after 77 minutes, causing the club's owners to change their plans for a 77 match ticket from next season. AFP

Women boxers vie for gold in three finals today
Sri Lanka shooters bagged four silver and eight bronze medals at the 2016 South Asian Games worked off at Guwahati Kalipara Firing Range yesterday. This achievement is a significant improvement when compared to the 2010 Dhaka SAG where they won only two bronze medals.
Damith Krishantha of Sri Lanka Navy created a new Sri Lankan record in the 50m Rifle Triple Action Shooting with a performance of 1149 points. The Mens and women's teams also won the silver in the 50m Rifle Triple Action event.
Sri Lankan pugilists added two silver medals to the overall medals tally when the boxing events were worked off at the Sai-sag Centre in Shillong. Ruwan Thilina Weerakkody (56kg) and Dinidu Dasun (64kg) had to settle for the silver when they were both defeated by their Indian opponents in the finals.
Boxers Gayan Sanjeewa (60kg), Ishan Ranjeewa Seneviratne (52kg), Thiwanka Sandaruwan (49kg) and Sisira Kumara (69kg) secured bronze medals in their respective weight categories. Sandaruwan who fought hard against his Indian rival was deprived of silver by a poor referees decision.
Sri Lanka women boxers participating for the first time in SAG will be featured in three finals today at the Sai-sag centre. Anusha Kodituwakku (51kg), Vidhushika Prabhashika (60kg) and Nilanthi Arachchige (75kg) are in high spirits to bring honour to the country.
Judo contests began yesterday and the finals will be held today at Shillong. Six Lankan men and six women judokas will be seen in action during the contests. The Taekwondo competitions concluded yesterday and Sri Lanka had to be satisfied with one silver and four bronze medals. Altogether 13 Lankans competed in the Taekwondo events and Piyum Sanjeewa (over 87kg) won the solitary silver. Sri Lanka also won three men's category bronze medals and one women's bronze in taekwondo. "Our performance was not up to expectations. We won one gold, one silver and four bronze medals at the 11th SAG. We hoped to bring more medals this time, but had to compete with tough Afghanistan opponents who were of Olympic standard," said the team manager.
