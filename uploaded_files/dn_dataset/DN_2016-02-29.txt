53rd Isipathana-Thurstan ends in a tame draw

The 53rd battle of the Brothers between Isipathana and Thurstan played over the week-end ended in a tame draw at the SSC even before the completion of first two innings of the match as both teams' approach with the bat was very sedate throughout the match especially Thurstan who took 110 overs to make 291 in their first innings.
Kasun Abeyratne renewing the 25-year old record for the highest individual score made by a Thurstan batsman in this 53-year old annual encounter scored 147 in Thurstan's first innings score of 291 for eight declared and his patient 348-ball innings with 17 fours placed Thurstan in a commanding position after they were put in by Isipathana. The record Kasun broke in this match was established by Kamal Mahendra in 1990.
The interesting feature of this record breaking was that Kasun established this new record under the captaincy of Charana Nanayakkara whose father Gamini Nanayakkara was the captain of Thurstan when Kamal Mahendran established his record in 1990.
Isipathana with a batting lineup that could be rated as one of the best in the island this year got off to a horrible start as they lost three quick wickets even before they put 50 on the board. However, SL youth wicket-keeper Vishad Randika, Sanjula Abeywickrama with 1000 runs under his belt this season and Pramod Madhuwantha, a star all-rounder in the schools circle did an excellent recovery job carrying Isipathana total to 222 for eight at close on the final day. Sanjula top scored for Isipathana with a gallant 75 while Pramod Madhuwantha finished with a good double of 4 wickets and 44 runs. Lahiru Dilshan also bowled well for Isipathana before Dilan Madusanka excelled with the ball for Thurstan.

All conquering Kandy SC signs off League with a flourish

Defending Dialog League champions Kandy Sports Club maintained their unbeaten record when they scored a rousing 27 points, (1 goal, 4 tries) to 12 (1 goal, 1 try) win over Havelocks SC in their final game of the Dialog League Championship played before a large crowd at the Nittawela Rugby Stadium yesterday. At half time Kandy led 10-5.
While Kandy excelled both in the scrums and line outs and also had the edge in the loose the Park Club did not rise upto the occasion and the two tries they scored were virtual gifts when Kandy's defence slackened and they were also without several of their key players.
The game started with Kandy drawing first blood when their forwards stormed the Havies territory and No. 8 Buwaneka Udangamuwa crashed over for left with stand-off Nigel Ratwatte failing to add the extra points. Kandy 5-0.
In the 12th minute Havelocks equalised through a fine try by hooker Pasindu Madusanka who went unchallenged to score by the right corner flag. Full back Rimzy Jamaldeen failed to add the extra points.
Kandy took over the lead in the 25th minute when centre Richard Dharmapala sliced through to score mid left but Ratwatte's kick at the goal was off target. Kandy 10-5.
With this score the teams changed ends.
In the 8th minute of the second half, one of the Havies forwards was seen intercepting a pass and gaining good ground into Kandy's territory and was brought down by Ratwatte and winger Vishwamithra Jayasinghe picking the loose ball made a blazing 60 metre run to score far right. Ratwatte failed to add the extra points. Kandy led 15-5.
Seven minutes later Ratwatte lend support to the three quarters and made a good 50 metre run to score far right but failed to add the extra points. Kandy 20-5.
Soon after Havelocks closed the gap through a try scored by centre Kevin Dixon under the post and full back Jamaldeen added the extra points. Havelocks 12-20.
During the closing stages of the game Kandy's substitute full back Tilina Wijesinghe joined the three quarters to score by the right post and Jamaldeen added the extra points to give Kandy a handsome win. With this win Kandy had conquered all the teams both home and away to win the League title for the 19th time.

Bangladesh stun Sri Lanka

After they ran into early trouble, Sabbir Rahman scored more than half of Bangladesh's runs. Their bowlers followed it up by squeezing Sri Lanka in the 148 chase, eventually picking up their second win in the Asia Cup by 23 runs.
A packed crowd at the Shere Bangla National Stadium was kept on the edge for three and a half hours, mainly by Man-of-the-Match Sabbir's superb and clean hitting that gave him ten fours and three sixes. The home side's tight bowling and rapid fielding across the outfield stood out too.
The loss would, however, ring loud alarm bells for Sri Lanka, especially after how they missed out on taking advantage of the home side slipping to 26 for 3, and later being unable to hit any boundaries for four and seven-over clumps. This was the first time Sri Lanka were beaten by Bangladesh in a T20.
On a pitch devoid of any grass, Bangladesh had to defend what Shakib Al Hasan called a "par score" in the innings break. But Shakib and Mustafizur Rahman bowled eight overs between them for just 40 runs, taking three wickets. Al-Amin Hossain finished with 3 for 34.
But Bangladesh's defence had not started well. Like he did in the previous match, Soumya Sarkar dropped a catch at slip in the first over, off Taskin Ahmed, this time the lucky batsman being Dinesh Chandimal who had not scored a run. Tillakaratne Dilshan too was dropped, though the chance at wide first slip in the second over was quite hard for a diving Mahmudullah.
But Dilshan was removed in the fourth over with Soumya making up for his drop with a brilliant catch running back about 30 yards from mid-off, diving full length and landing safely with the ball. Chandimal and Shehan Jayasuriya then added 56 runs for the second wicket though, like Bangladesh, they went through exactly four overs without a boundary.
Jayasuriya broke that duck with a six in the 11th over but Chandimal holed out in the same over after making a run-a-ball 37 after mainly trying reverse hits in the last few balls he faced. Shakib quickly removed Jayasuriya in the next over, for a 21-ball 26 after missing a wide delivery to get stumped by Nurul Hasan.
Bangladesh's biggest fear factor was Thisara Perera because of his performance in 2014 but today he was lackluster, falling leg-before to Mustafizur and Sri Lanka soon slipped to 92 for 5 in the 15th over.
Angelo Mathews swung and missed plenty during his 20-ball 12 before he was well caught at point by Shakib running back a fair way. In the 18th over, with 46 still required, Dasun Shanaka finaly struck one sweetly, breaking the seven-over boundary drought. Al-Amin conceded nine runs in the over and Sri Lanka were still 37 adrift from their target with two overs to go.
Mustafizur gave away just five runs in the penultimate over before Al-Amin took two wickets in the last over to seal the win.

Delimitation, demarcation of electoral boundaries must be agreeable to all - Mustapha
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha yesterday said he has been instructed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that the delimitation and demarcation of electoral boundaries in Local Government wards must be agreeable to all.
Minister Mustapha said this on being asked why that the process of demarcating electoral boundaries seemed to be getting all that late and the local poll that he said would be held in June, this year is unlikely to be held this year.
"I said as the minister handling the subject that the process of demarcation of boundaries would be completed and the Local Government election would be held in June.
But, there are certain issues that need to be agreed upon and resolved in view of the system of demarcation," explained Mustafa.
On being pointed out that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had recently stated that the local poll will be held next year after demarcation, the minister said this was due to key facets that need deliberations before the poll can be held under the new system.
Both Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and President Sirisena have said that 25 percent of all elected representatives of Local Government bodies should comprise women under whatever system the poll will be held.
President had said that the delimitation process must be carried out properly and correctly regardless of time constrains.
Mustapha said the UNP has its concerns and discrepancies about the system of demarcation-so does the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
"The final result of the delimitation of boundaries of local wards and the system as a whole must be agreed upon by everyone before it can be amended to the Constitution and put to operation so that the Local government poll can be held properly with the confidence of the public," he said.
"The LG election will be held once the demarcation is agreed upon by all, which will take time," he added.

Electoral organizers who cannot garner votes should vacate post : SBD
An electoral organizer who cannot garner at least 75 per cent of the votes cast for the party from their electorate, should vacate their electorate, Minister of Social Empowerment and Welfare S.B.Dissanayake stated.
The Minister who was appointed as the new SLFP electoral organizer for Hewaheta said that he was happy to leave his former electorate Udunuwara as he could not fulfil this requirement at the last general election.
Disanayake said that he was only able to get 10,000 votes out of 20,000 votes cast for the SLFP at the Udunuwara electorate. In contrast Dissanayake said that he had obtained 99.9 per cent of votes cast for the party when he was organizer of the Hanguranketha electorate.
The Minister also recalled that during his tenure as the SLFP General Secretary, he was instrumental in bringing a regulation that party organizers who cannot garner 75 per cent of votes cast for the party from their electorate should resign.
Dissanayake said that as a politician who hails from Udunuwara he was confident of gaining the upper hand for his party in the electorate at future elections.

Emma Watson calls for awesome alternatives...
Gloria Steinem discussed the differences between pornography and erotica in a conversation with the actress
Emma Watson has called for the creation of awesome alternatives to pornography that empower instead of objectifying women.
Watson spoke as she interviewed the iconic feminist campaigner Gloria Steinem to coincide with the release of Steinem's new book, My Life on the Road, which was the first to be featured in Watson's new feminist book club Our Shared Shelf.
Steinem has long stressed the difference between erotica and pornography and on Wednesday expressed concern at how young people may grow up to perceive sex through watching pornography. We should at least have a word for sex that is mutual and pleasurable and not about domination, pain, violence, humiliation and so on, she said.
Referring to a previous conversation she and Watson had, Steinem continued: We were both worried about the envelopment of the earth in pornographic images. Young people especially. The right wing (right wing just in a general way) on one hand is suppressing sex education and allowing, or profiteering off pornography so young people look at porno and think that's it. That's what is supposed to be. I was hoping that having a word for erotica, for shared mutual pleasurable empathetic sex, real pleasurable sex would help us do something about pornography. [...] Maybe not existing is a long way off, but having an alternative.
That I definitely think is possible, replied Watson. We should be creating lots of awesome, great alternatives to pornography.
Watson and Steinem discussed a number of issues relating to feminism during the 90-minute conversation including sexuality, abortion, violence against women and politics. They also touched on the significance of Hermione Granger as a character and the nervousness they both still feel before public speaking.
The pair spoke about their backgrounds and childhoods, with Watson admitting that as much as she tried to escape being Hermoine Granger in the Harry Potter series, she was more like her than she thought.
I feel as though I spent a long time trying to pretend I was not like Hermione. And, of course, I was rather like Hermione. I've finally come to accept that fact. It's made me who I am and I celebrate it.
Watson has emerged as a prominent feminist after giving her famous HeforShe speech to the UN in 2014 asking men to help in the fight for gender equality.
The 25-year-old recently announced she is to take a break from acting to focus on and learn more about feminism, a move which Steinem labelled great and important

Govt to obtain USD one billion IMF loan

The government is set to obtain a standby loan facility of US dollars one billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayaka yesterday said.
"IMF has agreed to release the loan facility to us. It will be used to move forward the country's economy," the minister told the Daily News.
The loan is expected to boost the country's sagging foreign-exchange reserves. The first tranche of the loan is expected within the next couple of weeks, Finance Ministry sources told the Daily News.
The ministry is planning to reduce the debt burden that grew under the previous regime, they said.
Minister Karunanayaka said they are planning to move forward the country's economy through strong macroeconomic stability, financial discipline, increased investments and elimination of corruption among other things. Asked if this loan could mean added taxes being imposed on the public, a ministry official said that elimination of corruption and taxing on the super rich are on the cards under the ministry's programme to achieve economic growth.
President Maithripala Sirisena is keen on reducing the interest costs on the public, which is a staggering US $ 55 billion in total debt, he explained.

Govt will end disparity in sharing benefits of development - President

President Maithripala Sirisena says the people in some areas did not receive the benefits of development due to some policies followed by the previous government.
"The current government gives prominence to under developed areas by ending the disparities in sharing the dividends of development," the President said.
The President was speaking at the ceremony held yesterday to vest the new Cardiac Unit built at the General Hospital, Polonnaruwa with the people.
The new Cardiac Unit which consists of 48 beds is equipped with modern facilities. The President also declared open the canteen and waiting room built at a cost of Rs.47 million in the hospital with modern facilities.
He laid the foundation stone for an Accident Care Unit which is expected to be built at a cost of Rs.465 million.
President Sirisena said he would develop all District and Divisional Hospitals by providing them the required facilities.
"The government's objective is to share the benefits of development with all provinces thereby ending an era when the people had to come to Colombo for better health services and education," he said.
The President further said the government has paid special attention on human resource development by filling the vacancies from the posts of specialists to the posts in the sections of nursing, supplement and technical.
The General Hospital in Polonnaruwa successfully performed its first kidney transplant operation on February 8. The President extended his thanks to the team of specialist doctors and staff who performed that operation.
North-Central Province Chief Minister Peshala Jayarathne, Members of Parliament Siripala Gamlath and Nalaka Kolonne, Health Services Director General Dr.Palitha Mahipala and Polonnaruwa General Hospital Director Dr. Indika Sampath Kumara also participated on the occasion.

Has Mark Zuckerberg upped security after IS threat

GERMANY: He is said to be so concerned about his own security that he now has no less than 16 people protecting him at his $7million Palo Alto, California home.
So it may not come as a surprise that Mark Zuckerberg, who was threatened by ISIS supporters earlier this week, wasn't taking his chances when he headed out for a casual jog while in Berlin.
Zuckerberg, pictured in one of his signature gray T-shirts while carrying his iPhone on Thursday, had at least five men surrounding him, in what appeared to be more than just a casual running club.
The Facebook CEO's show of strength in Berlin's Pariser Platz square comes just a day after supporters of ISIS threatened him and Twitter chief Jack Dorsey.
A new 25-minute video titled Flames Of The Supporters, found by Vocativ on Wednesday, features pictures of both entrepreneurs covered in bullet holes.
In it, the militants claim they control more than 10,000 Facebook accounts, 150 Facebook groups and 5,000 Twitter profiles - and warn they will retaliate to any attempt to drive them off the sites.
Text flashes up on the screen, which reads: 'To Mark and Jack, founders of Twitter and Facebook and to their Crusader government.
'You announce daily that you suspend many of our accounts.
'And to you we say: Is that all you can do You are not in our league.'.
It continues with shots of their militants on Facebook and Twitter, hacking accounts and changing their profile pictures to ISIS propaganda.
'If you close one account we will take 10 in return and soon your names will be erased after we delete your sites, Allah willing, and will know that we say is true,' it warns in subtitles. Zuckerberg, who was later pictured in Berlin with his wife Priscilla, has reportedly bumped up his security detail back home in Palo Alto due to threats from unstable website users, according to Page Six.
The billionaire is in Germany for two days of talks as the country debates how to tackle online xenophobia and hate speech amid an influx of refugees in to the country.
Facebook agreed in December to abide by German laws on hate speech on their sites in Germany, responding to complaints by the government that they are too slow to take down xenophobic abuse posted online.
Like fellow tech visionary Steve Jobs, who always wore a black turtleneck and jeans, Zuckerberg famously wears the same outfit every day - barring special occasions - and he made no exception for the jog, donning his signature T-shirt.
He has previously said making clothing decisions every day is a 'frivolous' waste of his time.
The new father joked last month upon returning from a two-month paternity leave what he should wear, picturing his closet which was filled with nothing but identical T-shirts and hoodies.
'First day back after paternity leave. What should I wear' he captioned the picture.
Her birth was, of course, announced on Facebook - and the couple vowed to give away 99 per cent of their fortune to charity in her honor. He also only took half of the paternity leave offered to Facebook employees. The company announced in November last year that new fathers working at Facebook will now be allowed to take four months of paid paternity leave.

Just two weeks to stop Trump juggernaut

US: Donald Trump has taken firm control of the race for the Republican Presidential nomination with his third straight victory, in Nevada.
To deny him that role, strategists say, his leading rivals must quickly change the trajectory of the race and then dig in for what could be a long battle that could go all the way to the GOP convention in Cleveland.
Strategists who have been through past nomination battles say that Senator Marco Rubio, Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich collectively have until March 15 to turn the race away from the New York billionaire.
Each has a must-win test looming in his home state between now and then. But those victories alone might not be sufficient to block Trump's path.
As for Trump, the front runner hopes to suffocate his three main rivals in the Super Tuesday contests, particularly in primaries across the Deep South, and to knock them off with wins in each of their home states. In his Las Vegas victory speech after the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday night, Trump predicted he would secure the nomination in less than two months and taunted his top three opponents by trumpeting his high poll numbers in Florida, Ohio and Texas.

The first opportunity to alter the campaign could come on Thursday night, when the Republican rivals meet in Houston for their first debate since the departure of former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who quit the campaign on Saturday after finishing fourth in South Carolina.
Changing the dynamic, however, depends on whether any of them has a strategy to put Trump on the defensive.
So far, Trump's rivals have focused more on one another than on him, in hopes of becoming Trump's last viable opponent. Many Republicans fear that strategy will only allow Trump to put a stranglehold on the nomination with continued victories in the coming weeks.
"The reality is that, until the field starts to narrow, it's going to be very, very hard to take him out," said Katie Packer, deputy campaign manager for Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign and the leader of an anti-Trump super PAC. "I think people need to step up and start taking on Trump. Front runners don't just stumble. People trip them."
After losing the Iowa caucuses to Cruz on February 1, Trump has piled up victories in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. He heads into next week's Super Tuesday contests in 11 states with the anti-Trump vote still splintered among his rivals.
Given Trump's string of successes, his rivals must demonstrate that they can beat him, not just finish ahead of each other.
"You have to win," Stuart Stevens, chief strategist for Romney in 2012, said. "Winning transforms a candidate, and losing transforms a candidate. You're not the same person after you've won a bunch of races, and you're not the same after you've lost a bunch of races."
Winning states does more than change perceptions. It's the key to amassing delegates. From here forward, the campaign shifts from a battle for momentum to the trench warfare of gathering delegates.
Trump has taken hold of the delegate race in large part by winning all 50 that were at stake in South Carolina on Saturday. The longer the field remains divided, the better Trump's opportunities to maintain or enlarge that lead.
David Wasserman, of the Cook Political Report, updated his delegate charts on Wednesday morning and concluded that Trump is on pace or slightly ahead of what he would need to win the 1237 delegates needed to secure the nomination. Rubio and Cruz are behind their pace to achieve that.
Only about 5 per cent of the total delegates have been awarded so far. But over the next three weeks, they will come in bunches, with 595 at stake on Tuesday and 368 more through March 12.
At that point, the rules shift in what could be a game-changing fashion. Between now and March 14, delegates will be awarded proportionally. Starting on March 15, states will be allowed to award delegates on a winner-takes-all basis. On that day alone, Florida, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio, with a combined 292 delegates allocated in that way, are among the states or territories with contests.
"It's important to take a deep breath here," Rubio said on Wednesday on CBS This Morning. "It's not based on how many states you win - it's based on how many delegates you picked up."
Looking ahead to the March calendar, Rubio said there were "plenty of states out there that - in the winner-take-all category - that if you win them, you more than catch up."
Over time, Rubio intends to more aggressively draw a contrast with Trump and call him out for inaccuracies or shallow policies. "We believe a majority of Republicans don't want Trump to be the nominee and will vote for an alternative," Rubio's communications director, Alex Conant, said. "As this becomes a two-person race, Marco will beat Trump head to head."
Jeff Roe, Cruz's campaign manager, argued that his candidate still has the best chance to defeat Trump, despite a loss in South Carolina.
"He's won three in a row," Roe said of Trump. "That's not lost on me." Still, he said that based on the campaign's projections of states and demographics and possible support, "the road map through March 15th will not be smooth sailing for Donald. For those that are hysterically declaring the race over should take a breath and look at the remaining 46 states."
At this point, however, none of Trump's leading rivals sees any incentive to get out of the race. All can sketch a path to the nomination, however difficult, and until they are proven wrong, they will soldier on.
Mike DuHaime, who was chief strategist for the presidential campaign of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, said he could imagine long-odds scenarios for Cruz, Rubio or Kasich and said the psychology of believing there is a path to victory, no matter what outsiders think, will keep the candidates going.
"I have been in those rooms," DuHaime said. "As long as you believe there is a path and a chance, you keep going."
Meanwhile, Trump's insular campaign is quickly expanding into a national organisation. Workers are on the ground in states with Super Tuesday primaries and are building grassroots networks there and in other states such as Florida. Campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said Trump has lined up a "crazy travel schedule" over the next couple of weeks and brushed off any suggestion that his boss was stoppable.

JVP leader calls for creation of youth force in tune with reality

JVP leader and Chief Opposition Whip, Anura Kumara Dissanayake said they should develop a youth force in the country who are in tune with reality, as opposed to a society steeped in myths and unscientific mindsets.
He was addressing the third convention of the Socialist Youth Union (SYU) held yesterday at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium.
The JVP leader said that today they were living in a society filled with myths and unreality. "We should conserve our traditional myths to give an idea about the country's history to the future generation. But these myths and beliefs has no power to solve social, economic and political issues of the country.
It is questionable whether the groups attempting to topple the government by dashing coconuts has the strength to lead the country towards prosperity. So we should form a youth front to save society from these myths and beliefs, he said. Dissanayake also said that this youth front should not be a front led by a son of a President, Chief Minister or a Chairman of a Pradeshiya Sabha. So the Socialist Youth Union has the capacity to lead a socialist youth movement to change the prevailing social set up.
The JVP leader also noted that that various groups were trying to spread racism and discrimination in order to gain political advantage.
We will never let any form of racial conflict to rise in this country again. We cannot label blood as Singha Le, Tamil Le or Muslim Le since we all have the same human blood, he said. He said today all the capitalist countries have become victims of an economic crisis. So the exploitation of resources of other countries by creating conflicts in those countries is the only way of survival for these capitalist countries. Today Sri Lanka too has beome a victim of the trap laid by these powerful countries.
Dissanayake also alleged that the prevailing weak government of Sri Lanka has not been able to fulfill even the basic needs of the people. Today youth in this country have to struggle for their life and future.

ZIMBABWE: Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe on Sunday blamed foreign interference for the infighting and succession battles plaguing his party as the world's oldest leader celebrated his 92nd birthday at a lavish affair.
Thousands of party loyalists, foreign representatives and members of the public watched as Mugabe released 92 balloons in the air, with songs and ululations ringing out around him.
Several cakes were on display at the public festivities Saturday, one in the shape of Africa, another a whopping 92-kilogram replica of the party venue: the Great Zimbabwe ruins, a UNESCO world heritage site built in the 13th Century as the headquarters of the Munhumutapa empire.
Balloons and cake, however, did little to hide the infighting that has defined the ruling ZANU-PF party in the last year as Mugabe continues to avoided naming a successor, despite his advanced age and recent speculation over his health.
Mugabe, who turned 92 last Sunday, has ruled for 36 years during an era marked by vote-rigging, mass emigration, accusations of human rights abuses and economic decline.
On his actual birthday, state media poured praise on his leadership since independence from Britain.
In its 16-page special supplement, the Sunday Mail said on its front cover: "Thank You Bob, We now have a voice, since 1980".
Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa is viewed as the likely next president, but in recent weeks he has been publicly criticised by Mugabe's wife Grace in a sign of growing rivalry.
"Factionalism, factionalism and, I repeat, factionalism has no place at all in our party," Mugabe told guests including senior party officials, government ministers, foreign diplomats and representatives of ruling parties from Angola, Botswana, South Africa, Namibia and Tanzania.
"It should never be allowed to exist... We should remain united and use proper channels to solve our differences."
The long-time leader also used the opportunity to launch into a characteristic attack on the West.
"The British and American in their cunning ways, as usual, have also utilised such opportunities to offer huge sums of money to individuals both within and outside the party to cause factionalism which has greatly affected the youth especially as of the recent past," he said.
The scale of the celebrations, costing a reported $800,000 this year, attracts annual controversy in Zimbabwe, which recently declared a "state of disaster" due to an ongoing regional drought and widespread food shortages.
"There is very little to celebrate for a 92-year-old who has presided over the collapse of the economy, reducing the country to a nation of vendors and beggars," Takavafira Zhou, a political analyst at Masvingo State University, told AFP.
Zimbabwe has suffered a series of food crises and hyper-inflation since Mugabe's land reforms when farms were seized from white farmers for redistribution.
On Tuesday, scores of young supporters from the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party staged a protest in Masvingo.
Protest placards read: "No birthday when children are starving" and "We want jobs, not bashes."
Local media reported that party activists ordered teachers and villagers in the rural districts of Masvingo to make cash donations to help pay for this year's celebrations.

Rouhani cheers election wins, says government stronger
IRAN: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani won an emphatic vote of confidence and reformist partners secured surprise gains in parliament in early results from elections that could accelerate the Islamic Republics emergence from years of isolation.
While gains by moderates and reformists in Fridays polls were most evident in the capital, Tehran, the sheer scale of the advances there suggests a legislature more friendly to the pragmatist Rouhani has emerged as a distinct possibility.
A loosening of control by the anti-Western hardliners who currently dominate the 290-seat parliament could strengthen his hand to open Iran further to foreign trade and investment following last years breakthrough nuclear deal.
A reformist-backed list of candidates aligned with Rouhani was on course to win all 30 parliamentary seats in Tehran, initial results released on Sunday showed. Top conservative candidate Gholamali Haddad Adel was set to lose his seat.
The people showed their power once again and gave more credibility and strength to their elected government, Rouhani said, adding he would work with anyone who won election to build a future for the industrialized, oil-exporting country.
The polls were seen by analysts as a potential turning point for Iran, where nearly 60 percent of its 80 million population is under 30 and eager to engage with the world following the lifting of most sanctions.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani waves after casting his vote during elections for the parliament and Assembly of Experts on Friday.
Based on the votes that we have so far it looks like the principlists will lose the majority in the next Majlis (parliament) shy of 50 percent.
The reformists gained 30 percent and independent candidates did better than before, gaining 20 percent, said Foad Izadi, an assistant professor at the Faculty of World Studies in Tehran University.
Principlists, otherwise known as hardliners, hold 65 percent of the outgoing parliament and the rest is divided between reformists and independents who traditionally support Rouhani.
Izadi said the reformists strong lead was prompted by Rouhanis success in reaching a nuclear agreement between Iran and international powers, the removal of most of the punitive sanctions that had strangled the countrys economy over the past decade and restoration of relations with the West.
It is a sweeping victory for Tehran but for other cities it is not yet clear cut. It is beyond expectations, he added.
Etemad, a reformist newspaper whose managing-editor Elias Hazrati won a seat in Tehran, has chosen the first headline of clean up in the parliament.
The next parliament will be like no other parliament in the history of Iran as no political faction will have the absolute say, the newspaper said on its front-page.
Millions crowded polling stations on Friday to vote for parliament and the Assembly of Experts, which selects the countrys highest authority, the supreme leader. Both bodies have been in the hands of hardliners for years.
Supporters of Rouhani, who promoted the nuclear deal, were pitted against hardliners close to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who are wary of detente with Western countries.
Rouhani and key ally and former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani were leading the race for the Assembly of Experts with most votes counted, and appeared to be sure of winning seats, early results released on Saturday showed. Until now, the contest for this seat of clerical power was an unremarkable event, but not this time. Because of Khameneis health and age, 76, the new assembly members who serve eight-year terms are likely to choose his successor. The next leader could well be among those elected this week.
Rafsanjani is among the founders of the Islamic Republic and was its president from 1989-1997. Nearly always at the center of Irans intricate webs of power, the arch-fixer is famous for his pragmatism and political acumen.
Two prominent hardliners were on course to be elected with lesser scores in the experts assembly race: Ahmad Jannati was in 11th place and the assemblys current chairman, Mohammad Yazdi, was 15th. Arch-conservative Mohammad-Taghi Mesbah-Yazdi appeared unlikely to win a seat, according to partial results.
The results were initially announced as final in an official statement. A later statement said the results were partial and a final tally would be announced in due course.
Based on official results published so far,the pro-Rouhani camp and allied independents were leading in the parliamentary vote. Some moderate conservatives, including current speaker Ali Larijani, support Rouhani.
A breakdown of the results had independents on 44, reformists on 79, and hardliners on 106, the tally showed.
A number of seats will be decided in run-offs in late April because no candidate won the required 25 percent of votes cast. Eight of the initial winners were women.
Analyst say the large number of independents may be significant as they could cooperate across ideological lines with Rouhanis government.
Whatever the outcome, Irans political system places much power in the hands of the conservative Islamic establishment including the Guardian Council, which vets all laws passed by parliament.

Raveen Yasas after his 36 with the bat completed a five-for with the ball, but his effort could not save his side from handing first innings advantage to the Kurunegala school. Devapathiraja batting for the second time around built a T20-type innings scoring 133 for nine in just 14 overs.

Warren Buffett to Republicans: Don't 'bet against America'

US: Renowned investor Warren Buffett has a message for presidential candidates lamenting the supposed decline of the country: the United States is better than ever.
The billionaire stock picker waded into the campaign Saturday in an annual letter to shareholders of his holding company Berkshire Hathaway by dismissing what he called a "negative drumbeat."
"It's an election year, and candidates can't stop speaking about our country's problems -- which, of course, only they can solve," the 85-year-old philpanthropist wrote, without naming names.
"Many Americans now believe that their children will not live as well as they themselves do. That view is dead wrong," he said.
Babies born in the United States today are actually the "luckiest crop in history," he added.
"For 240 years it's been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start," said the man called the "Oracle of Omaha" after his hometown in the midwestern state of Nebraska.
"America's golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs."
The candidates in the Republican primary race have, in particular, painted a picture of a fading superpower, famously summarized in property magnate Donald Trump's slogan: "Make America great again/"
Buffet -- the world's third-richest man in 2015, according to Forbes Magazine -- has publicly backed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Buffett's annual shareholders' letter is widely read thanks to his hugely successful investing record, ability to distill complicated subjects and dispensing of home truths.
Berkshire Hathaway -- which employs more than 350,000 people in the insurance, railroad and many other firms it controls -- also holds large stakes in Coca-Cola, IBM and other companies.
The octogenarian also revealed a secret of his longevity in his letter.
During Berkshire Hathaway's upcoming shareholders' meeting, he would consume enough Coke and candy "to satisfy the weekly caloric needs of an NFL lineman," he said.
"There's nothing like eating carrots and broccoli when you're really hungry," he added, "and want to stay that way."
