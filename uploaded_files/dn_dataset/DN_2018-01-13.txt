Breakthrough achieved on German grand coalition
GERMANY: German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives reached a "breakthrough" deal on Friday with the country's second biggest party, the Social Democrats, toward building a new coalition government, sources close to the negotiations said.
After more than 24 hours of talks, party chiefs reached an in-principle deal to start formal coalition talks that could lead in the coming months to a new government for the biggest EU economy, the sources told AFP.
In the all-night talks in Berlin, the party chiefs -- Merkel of the Christian Democrats as well as Social Democrats (SPD) leader Martin Schulz and the head of Merkel's Bavarian allies, Horst Seehofer -- and their negotiators hammered out a 28-page joint paper that will form the basis for the talks ahead.
Potential pitfalls remain, including votes by sceptical SPD delegates and later the labour party's rank-and-file members that could yet give the thumbs down to another left-right "grand coalition", the constellation that has ruled Germany for the past four years.
Germany has been in political paralysis since a September 24 election in which Merkel failed to win a clear majority -- in part due to the rise of the far-right and anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) which took millions of votes from all major parties.
Merkel initially turned to two smaller parties, the Free Democrats and Greens, to form a new coalition government for her forth term, but when those talks collapsed in November, she had to once more woo a reluctant SPD for a new power pact.
Both Merkel and Schulz went into the talks on Thursday warning of "big obstacles" ahead, and major sticking points in the red-eye negotiations that followed were immigration, finances and health policy, sources said.
Everything was at stake for Merkel and the other party leaders in the marathon talks.
"The negotiations are not just about a coalition, but also their careers," said Karl-Rudolf Korte of Duisburg-Essen University. "It would be the end for all three if this coalition does not come about."
Germany's rude economic health has stood in stark contrast to the political paralysis which has entered a fourth month, with Merkel currently running a caretaker government.
In fact the political talks were tripped up by the country's strong finances, as parties had opposing views on how to spend the cash.
The SPD, seeking to push its social welfare agenda, is demanding greater relief for the lower and middle income brackets and tax hikes for top earners, while the conservatives had campaigned with a promise of "tax cuts for all".
The embattled mainstream parties are also struggling to fend off the encroaching far right, which has seized on anger and fears over a mass influx of refugees and netted a record showing at the September poll.
To halt a haemorrhage to the AfD, Merkel's alliance wants a tougher stance on immigration, something that is hard to sell to the SPD.
A new coalition deal can still be torpedoed when SPD delegates, and later rank-and-file members, get to vote on whether the party should once again govern in Merkel's shadow.
Scepticism is high after the SPD scored a humiliating result in September.
The SPD's youth wing chief Kevin Kuehnert has vowed to embark on a national tour to press his case to opposing a new grand coalition before a September 21 party congress.
"The mood of the party rank and file with regards to a grand coalition is still grim. That's why I think we have a good chance," said Kuehnert. - AFP

Bill proposes drasticfine for trespassing foreign boats
The Government has proposed a drastic increase in the fine for unauthorised foreign fishing boats trespassing the territorial waters of Sri Lanka under an Amendment Bill to the Fisheries (Regulation of Foreign Fishing Boats) Act.
The Bill is scheduled to be taken up for debate in Parliament on January 24.
The Bill proposes fines ranging from Rs.5-175 million depending on the length of the boat in metres or a jail sentence not exceeding two years.
Up to now the fine for the above offence was Rs 1.5 million. The fine applies to the master, owner and charterer, or any person on board of such boat. Any foreign fishing boat seized and detained or any abandoned foreign fishing boat and any person arrested will be brought to the nearest or most convenient port in Sri Lanka and produced before the nearest Magistrate.
The prosecution relating to any offence committed under the Act must be concluded within one month.
The minimum fine will be Rs 5 million for boats less than 15 metres, Rs 20 million for boats between 15 and 24 metres, Rs 100 million for boats between 24 and 45 metres, Rs 150 million for boats between 45 and 75 metres and Rs. 175 million for boats over 75 metres in length.
The Bill has further proposed to increase the fine for foreign fishing boats entering Sri Lanka waters without a permit to stow gear from Rs.750,000 to Rs. 3-150 million depending on the length of the boat in metres. The same ranges of fine apply for any foreign fishing boat used in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Sri Lanka without a valid permit.
All offences committed under the Act are cognizable and non-bailable. Boats and fishing gear etc will be retained until conclusion of the trial.
The release of abandoned foreign fishing boats along with fishing gear, fish, aquatic plants, equipment, stores, and cargo will be only after an inquiry.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera will move the Bill for debate in Parliament. This Bill coupled with the recently passed legislation banning bottom trawling, will discourage the intrusion of Indian fishermen in Sri Lanka waters. Thus it will address the long standing issue of illegal fishing by Indian fishermen trespassing into Sri Lanka waters.

Bond issue chaos and renewed fight against corruption
If the Treasury Bond issue reached the lowest depth of corruption the country has seen, it also led to the worst display of behaviour in parliament by its members. It was a situation of bedlam where those expected to display the dignity of the House, the supreme legislature, showed instead an abundance of thuggery, obscenity, and the distortion of privilege to the extremities of rowdiness.
The pandemonium in the House showed the political impact of the Treasury Bond issue and the findings of the Presidential Commission (PCoI) that probed it. The House met at the request of the Joint Opposition (JO) and UNP, keen to debate the contents of the PCoI Report. Those who called for the special session of Parliament for this highly divisive purpose, made the mistake of not ensuring the PCoI report would be tabled in the House by the time of the debate. It was a mistake in strategy by the JO who sought to make use of the debate to attack the government, especially in the context of the Local Government poll campaign now being fired up.
President Maithripala Sirisena mentioned in his statement on the PCoI report on January 3 that the Report would be presented to Parliament, and needed to be presented to the people. But he did not give a date for its release. The JO members, who saw the opportunity for a blistering attack on the government, especially the Prime Minister and the UNP, quickly rushed to call for a special session of Parliament, but did not ensure that the Report would be with them.
The Prime Minister too called for a session of the House, seeing in it the opportunity to make his own statement on the Bond issue, and do a twist on allegations directed at the leadership of the previous government, the Rajapaksa Regime.
The result was the ugly and wholly unparliamentary chaos and bedlam on Wednesday, where allegations were made by the JO against the Speaker for not arranging to have the Report to be presented in the House, many of such charges being irrelevant; and the chaotic situation prevailed in their having to listen to the Prime Ministers statement on the Bond issue. The JO would serve itself better if they pay more attention to the procedure of the House, than political tactics, and avoid such hasty situations, which led to an unprecedented collective insult to the parliamentary process; and also gave the Prime Minister and the UNP the opportunity to make its own politically tactical statement, when the relationship between the UNP and SLFP in the coalition of governance stands at its lowest.
Who are the thieves
Unuth Horu  Munuth Horu  these are all thieves is the substance of the political finding in the Bond issue probe. It was well described by President Sirisena at the inaugural polls rally of the SLFP at Anuradhapura, Wednesday, when referring to the parliamentary chaos he said: Just as a pickpocket calls out there is a thief, there is a thief while snatching someones purse, the two factions in parliament today accused each other of being thieves. But the people know who the real thieves are.
The Bond issue situation certainly shows some advantage to the SLFP in the immediate situation, and definite disadvantages to the UNP. But the issue is certainly much wider. The search for thieves, among political rivals today is largely the result of the failure of the Yahapalanaya government to fully implement its pledge to bring to justice the perpetrators of corruption of the former regime. The new pledges to find the thieves in politics and governance, is certainly opening a new area of search, of those in the present government, as well as those in the Rajapaksa Regime. The question that both the President and Prime Minister will face in the days ahead is how well and with what speed, it could act against those involved in the Bond issue, and seriously act against the corruption of the previous government. This certainly raises major issues for the SLFP, especially with its present ministers, who held such positions in the Rajapaksa Regime, too.
While the PCol Report on the Bond issue could give immediate political benefits to President Sirisena and the SLFP, it also raises issues about the continuance of the National Government - the agreement for which has already ended. The leaders of both parties say they will look at the issue after the Local Polls on February 10, but, the rivalry and antagonism between the UNP and SLFP rising in this poll campaign, certainly shows moves for a breakaway than future unity.
Of special significance here is the speech made by SLFP Minister Susil Premajayantha at the Anuradhapura rally on Wednesday. He made it clear the main enemy of the SLFP was the UNP, and the time for dealing with this enemy was fast approaching. He has been one of the key figures active in seeking a pact between the SLFP and SLPP for this poll, which failed, and has now led to a clear rivalry between the two groups  in government and opposition.
The situation would certainly come to a crisis if the JO goes ahead with its proposed motion of No Confidence against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament. Having publicly opposed the UNP and its leader through the poll campaign and over the Bond issue, it will certainly be a very tough call for the SLFP members in government to oppose such a No Confidence move. This will be a major political challenge to President Sirisena, who still talks of the unity of government. It also required the SLFP (in government) to realize that the UNP, while facing a major crisis in popularity, still has a majority in parliament, which could be increased with the offer of portfolios to those in opposition. Can the SLFP vote against Ranil Wickremesinghe, and remain in a coalition of unity.
The Presidency
This rivalrous situation could also have influenced President Sirisena to seek the Supreme Courts judgment on his term of office  whether five or six years. He was largely responsible for the 19th Amendment, which reduced the Presidents term to five years, and was fully supportive of it. But the possibility of a legal entitlement to six years, as he was sworn in before the 19th Amendment, has certainly raised a new question. If the Supreme Court were to hold in favour of six years, it could lead to a major turnaround in the current political debate, where his leadership of an undivided SLFP will be of much bigger significance in his future years in the Presidency. It would also mean his holding the SLFP leadership for longer.
This will also raise new questions for the UNPs continued association with the SLFP, which may compel the UNP to take a go-it-alone policy, despite the major disadvantages it could have, in the context of the Bond issue and non-action against corruption of the previous regime. It is necessary to note that the Ministry of Justice and the Police have been under the UNP in Yahapalanaya, and the President himself has raised concerns about delays in fighting against the Rajapaksa corruption.
Earlier issues
In the context of Bond issue corruption, it is useful to quote the Prime Minister on the Bond issuances from 2008 to 2014, which the PCoI has asked for a probe. He told parliament that the majority of the bond issuances during that period were done as direct private placements, with no transparency. Bonds to the tune of Rs. 4,702,232,210,000 had been issued as direct private placements, with no approval of the Monetary Board.
He said the Finance Minister at the time, Mahinda Rajapaksa, should make a statement in parliament regarding this matter, as the representatives of the people and the public have the right to know about these transactions.
While the Prime Minister has certainly made a big push for a probe on these bond issuances, the UNP is certainly facing a major problem of popularity by continuing to use Ravi Karunanayake in the front line of its poll campaign. This is certainly not the stuff the public would like to see, in the anti-corruption context.
Weerawansa
With the rising echoes of corruption, the JOs NFF leader Wimal Weerawansa has been served indictments on the corruption case filed against him by the Bribery Commission, for the alleged unlawful acquisition of money and assets, estimated at Rs.75 million while serving as a Minister, during the former regime. This case is to be taken up on February 19. The trail of corruption shows signs of activity from the slow pace of the past three years.
While the bedlam in Parliament will remain a matter of public concern, it is also interesting to note that many of those who were calling for action on the Bond issue are those who, like Weerawansa, are involved in many issues of corruption under the previous government, and seem to have been protected under Yahapalanaya. When will the real hunt begin

Bridging Lanka-Pakistan trade imbalance needed
Pakistans Minister for Commerce Mohammad Pervaiz Malik yesterday emphasised the need to bridge the imbalance in the trade volume between Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
He said that unfortunately the present trade volume of around USD 350 million did not reflect the true potential that exist between the two countries. The Pakistani Minister was delivering his welcome remarks at the inauguration of the Third Edition of Pakistan Single Country Exhibition at the BMICH yesterday.
For Pakistan, Sri Lanka is among the top focus countries for greater trade relations. Despite the availability of tariff concessions, the bilateral trade is still limited to a very narrow brand of products and there is very little diversification, Minister Malik said. He highlighted that Pakistan is one of the rapidly emerging world economies with a friendly business environment created by the current government through policies aimed at achieving micro-economic stability in the country.
He said that Pakistan and Sri Lanka have excellent diplomatic and economic relations and added that the Free Trade Agreement manifest the trust that two countries have in the economic potential of each other.
The Minister said that during the visit of President Maithripala Sirisena to Pakistan, both leaders agreed to increase the bilateral trade to USD 1 Billion.
Increasing bilateral trade to USD 1 Billion might seem ambitious but with sustained efforts and spirit of cooperation, I am confident its not beyond us, the PakistanCommerce Minister said.
The world is on a fast path of integration and the regions need to integrate better, he said.
He further pointed out that trade among SAARC countries is less than 5 percent of the total trade and which it self is a strong reflection of the world trade.
Pakistan and Sri Lanka have to play a major role to see our region integrate for the socioeconomic improvement of our people, he said.
He expressed the hope that such events would set the foundations for greater people to people connectivity and mutual economic growth.

Case against Kumara Welgama fixed for February 23
The Colombo Chief Magistrates Court yesterday, fixed for February 23 the corruption case filed against former Transport Minister Kumara Welgama.
This is for allegedly causing unlawful loss to the government after appointing an individual as a Deputy Chairman of the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) contrary to the Transport Act.
When the case came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Thanuja Lakmali Jayatunga, the Court was informed that Kumara Welgama has filed a revision application in the High Court challenging the Magistrates Court's decision to accept amended charge sheets filed against the former Minister by the Bribery Commission. The High Court is to deliver its order on January 30.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed this case against former Minister Welgama under Section 70 of the Bribery Act on four charges. The Bribery Commission alleged that the former Minister had unlawfully appointed L.A. Wimalaratne as the Deputy Chairman of the SLTB on June 23, 2010 when he was the Transport Minister.
The Bribery Commission further alleged that the former minister had paved the way to confer a payment of Rs.3.2 million to the Deputy Chairman as his salary and other benefits, causing unlawful loss to the Government.

Chaos into order
The recent tense situation that prevailed in Parliament was a deliberate act created by anti Ranil group of parliamentarians; according to one analyst who studied the development of all events, which preceded the parliament clash. Parliament debate on Bond Commission was a demand made in general, by the opposition members of parliament. Agreeing to this request, it was arranged by the Prime Minister with the consent of the President to call the parliament to discuss the Bond Commission report.
Party leaders met on previous Tuesday to discuss the letter sent by the Prime Minister requesting to summon the parliament, to debate the Bond Commission report. In fact it was MP Dinesh Gunawardena who had written to the Prime Minister asking him to request the Speaker to summon parliament under Standing Orders.
The Prime Minister has called the parliament according to rules and regulations. It was the responsibility of the Presidential Secretariat to hand over the document to the Speaker, as requested. However this has not happened, as the President wanted to study the commission report further. Presidential Secretariat had informed the Speaker that report will be sent to the parliament a week later.
Hence it is wrong to say that the government planned to sabotage the parliamentary session on the Bond report debate. However the opposition claimed that the government was aware of the main culprit who should be held responsible for the Bond issue. They screamed the government headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe wanted to create chaos in parliament and divert the attention of the MPs. This is for the first time in the history of parliament that such a situation was created with the intervention of a Prime Minister. We ask why the Premier was shouting Mahinda hora, when Mahinda Rajapaksa has no connection with the Bond issue that took place in 2015. Thus, it is apparent that the government had intended diverting the attention of the MPs from debating the bond report. They screamed and created a clash inside the parliament. Subsequently, the party leaders had met and decided to obtain a copy of this report and it was expected to be distributed among the parliamentarians giving them sufficient time to prepare for the debate.
Central Bank bond issue
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informed Parliament that he had taken action on the Central Bank bond issue soon after it surfaced in March 2015. He said he appointed a three-member committee headed by lawyer Gamini Pitipana to look into this matter, and it recommended further action and pointed out that he tabled a copy of that report to Parliament on May 19, 2015. Later, the COPE headed by JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti inquired into this matter further and submitted its report. I referred both this reports and the Auditor Generals report to the Attorney General. I also sought legal advice to determine whether there has been fraud, a deviation of the proper procedure and whether Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran was responsible for what happened. I informed the Secretary General of Parliament to send all the documents, required by the Attorney General, with the Speakers permission, the Prime Minister said.
When the accusation of corruption was made in the issuance of Central Bank bonds under the Yahapalana government, many believed it to be a ploy of the Mahinda group. There was the belief that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is free of corruption and any money drawn from the government coffers will be used for a valid political purpose. Even if there was an illicit manipulation it could be explained in term of political needs.
Many had voted for the new leaders led by Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe, because they promised to be transparent and non-corrupt. In particular Prime Minister had such a track record. Human beings believe in something good that prevailed in the past and hope it will come in the future to sustain their hope and thereby their lives. The hope of those who voted for the new government was that its leaders would not be corrupt, and they would have the capacity to lead the country under globalization, to become a developed one like many countries of Southeast Asia have become in a short period. Denials of wrong doing on the part of government leaders led by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe were therefore convenient to accept by many, who supported the democratic change.
Financial manipulation
However, when the Commission of Inquiry appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena began their hearings, which were publicized in the media, the faithful supporters were in pain and questioned why Premier do not explain what happened and what purpose this financial manipulation was made. Slowly their faith in the government leaders became eroded. There is a strong desire in the country that the practice of corruption especially at the top should not be permitted to continue.
The commissioners, who had proven track records of competence, conducted themselves in a restrained manner but did their task well. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe volunteered to come before them and give evidence. That made the faithful happy and hopeful. There is criticism that the Prime Minister was not subject to the tough cross examination that some of the others who came before the commission had to cope with. But this is not entirely true, because with penetrating analysis the commission has issued strictures on him too. The report of the Bond Commission has stated that the Prime Minister should not have believed the Central Bank officials on the bond issue.
Many political and social leaders, both here and abroad have pointed to the significant fact that a sitting Prime Minister was summoned before the commission and went before it. He was questioned by the commissioners and gave his evidence before them. This has set a precedent that all are equal before the law. This is a practice in western countries but not in the less developed countries. If Lanka is now on the path to being a developed country and there needs to be pressure from civil society, political parties and the courts of law, to take it there. The Prime Minister himself, called for an early debate on the commission report in parliament. This happened immediately and there was very interesting discussion and became an opportunity to discuss institutional reforms necessary to avoid such break downs.
Local election campaign
In this context, President Sirisenas statement to the nation on the report of the presidential commission played a negative role according to many critiques. They say the commission report has given to the president the opportunity to reaffirm his commitment to the political platform on which he sought election in January 2015. It also comes at an opportune time when he leads his party at the local election campaign. The main plank of political platform at the presidential election three years ago, from Sirisena side was the issue of corruption in the acts of the Mahinda regime. In his election campaign the president pledged to eliminate corruption and to bring in good governance.
The problem of democracy and national problem was emphasized by PM Ranil Wickremesinghe and Sama Samaja leaders backed by civil society.
There is a campaign to tarnish the image of non racist democratic leaders, particularly PM Wickremesinghe by some elements loyal to President Sirisena.
They say the tight monitoring of corruption that was anticipated did not materialize. Instead sections of the government have slipped into large scale corruption; so much so that it have provided those in the former Mahinda regime, to shout loudly for harassing them!

'Country has enough coconuts'
The country has produced enough coconuts for consumption, sources from the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute said.
The sources said the high price of a coconut is recorded these days due to traders' attempt to earn a high profit.
Sri Lanka needs around 2,000 million coconuts annually.
The sources said the coconut harvest dropped by 20 percent in 2017 compared to the previous year's production. Adverse weather and sale of coconut lands to construct houses are two main reasons for the drop, the sources said.

Ending the narcotics scourge
We have often seen newspaper headlines such as 200 Kgs of heroin detected, but eventually there is often no trace of the said amount. In other words, there is a real possibility that these drugs re-enter circulation in Colombo and elsewhere. This is an inexcusable state of affairs, in the light of the fact that narcotics can destroy our younger generation.
It was no secret that the previous Government had several high-profile members involved in drug running. In fact, when the STF raided the premises of a top politician linked to narcotics during this period, instructions went from the highest levels to stop the investigation. And we all know what happened to an Army Major who waited to nab a politicians son involved in drug trafficking and peddling. Despite anti-narcotic rhetoric, that Government took little or no action to control the flow of drugs into the country or stop their distribution within the country.
On the other hand, this Government has taken several positive steps to stem to tide of drugs. Both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are outspoken proponents of tough measures against drug trafficking. There have been several spectacular detections of narcotics in recent times. Since the end of the conflict, the Navy and the Coastguard have had more time to devote to ending illegal activities on the high seas and as a result, they have been able to thwart many attempts to smuggle drugs by boat. There is a shortage of illicit drugs on the street as a direct result of these efforts, but still, narcotics worth Rs.450 million change hands every day throughout the country.
The only real way of ensuring that drugs do not reach the street is intercepting drugs at border points and destroying any seized drugs stocks. The same rule should apply to smuggled cigarettes and any other harmful substances. This has not been done properly until now. Now the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) is scheduled to publicly destroy over 900 kilograms of cocaine on Monday in Katunayake, which were seized during previous raids at the Bandaranaike International Airport and other places. This follows a statement by Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka earlier this month that measures would be taken to destroy seized narcotics publicly.
The Police Special Task Force (STF), the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) and Organized Crimes Prevention Division, had seized heroin, illegal cigarettes, liquor and cannabis worth Rs. 37.55 billion during 2017. The PNB alone had seized 220 kg and 650g of cocaine worth over Rs 4.4 million during 2017, while 29 arrests had been made during the same period. This is a major achievement in the drive against narcotics.
Narcotics is a multi-billion dollar international business that knows no boundaries. Sri Lanka has been identified as a hot transshipment spot for international narcotics smugglers pushing their deadly wares to Europe and USA. The Navy and our immigration agencies have a great role to play in nabbing such operatives and their craft. Sri Lankan authorities should also share available intelligence with foreign anti-narcotics agencies on these elements. It is due to such networking that our sleuths were able to track down and bring home several drug kingpins who were hiding abroad.
The society should also be vigilant about the activities of drug lords and their minions. Police should encourage people to tip them off about any drug pushing activity in their neighbourhood. There is also a common refrain that only the small fry get caught when it comes to drug detections while the kingpins go scot free. This picture should be changed and to the credit of the Police, they have nabbed several drug lords. But the society has another role  reject anyone dealing in drugs at any level in any field of activity. Hence we applaud Prime Minister Wickremesinghes recent statement that voters should reject any candidate from any party who has connections with the narcotics trade, at the forthcoming Local Government Polls. With political parties fielding at least 70 candidates with dubious track records for the LG Polls, this is a timely advice from the Premier.
However, the society should not shun those who are addicted to drugs. All should contribute to the drive to rehabilitate them and make them useful citizens again. According to the Dangerous Drugs Control Board, over 250,000 Lankan youth are addicted to illicit drugs. Close to 50,000 youth have been found to be addicted to heroin alone. Statistics show that only around 2,500 youth are enrolled in rehabilitation programmes annually. This is simply not enough, given the number of drug addicts in the country.
The fight against illicit drugs should begin at home and at school. Parents should be more vigilant about what their children are up to as drug peddlers are keen to rope in new customers and schoolchildren are seen as an easy target. Children should be taught about the destructive effects of tobacco, alcohol and illegal drugs as part of their school curriculum. That will be the key to creating a drug-free society in the future.

Havies have the edge over Army
The second placed Havelock Sports Club will have a slight edge over Army Sports Club in their Dialog A Division League return game at Havies grounds in Havelock Park, Colombo today. The Match will commence under lights at 6:30 pm.
The Army played a somewhat of a dejected game against Navy Sports Club in their last game at Havelock Park thus losing the game by 10-28 after a close fight in the first half where the score read 14 points to 10 in favour of Navy SC.
Hence they will have to carry out an improved performance if they hope to beat the Havelock's outfit.
The forte of the Havies side have been their power-packed forwards along with their speedy three quarter line and they should come up with much better display with skipper Jason Melder, Prasath Madusanka, Sharo Fernando, lanky Shehan Dias, Dushmantha Priyadarshana, Sudam Sooriarachchi and Niroshan Fernando, Chamara Dabare, Hirantha Perera, Sadun Herath ,
Reeza Mubarak along with their ever green national centre Nishon Perera are
likely to give of their best as they lost to CH and FC last week by 25-27 after a close encounter.
Meanwhile the Havelock's side who turned tables on Army SC side in their first round outing by 29 points to 19 at Police Park will go all out to get an all important victory in this game, since the match will be played at their own den at Havelock Park.
Havelock SC (Probable XV)

Navy firm favourites
Navy SC who scored a thumping 28-10 win at the hands of Army SC at Havelock Park last week will be the firm favourites and go all out to give a repeat performance when they take on Police SC in their Dialog A Division
League rugby second round match at Police home grounds in Police Park today. Kickoff will be at 4.00pm. Police who went down fighting to CR & FC by 31 points to 33 at their home grounds in Police Park last week and nearly turned tables but unfortunately went down by a whisker. So the Cops will have to come up with a much better performance if they hope to overcome the formidable Navy lads who have notched up victories over top sides like CH and FC, CR & FC and Havelocks.
Hence the cops will have to really rally around and strive hard to pull off this game in their favour.

As a result of such steps, an Interim Report of the Steering Committee has been submitted to the Constitutional Assembly. The report contains matters of importance that merit consideration.
My prayer is that a new constitution will be framed without any further delay in the new year which will uphold the right to dignity, self respect, and justice on the basis of equality amongst all citizens of Sri Lanka so as to ensure goodwill unity and genuine reconciliation within an undivided and indivisible Sri Lanka.

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday asserted that he would accept the decision of the Supreme Court regarding his request seeking clarification on his term in office.
He emphasized that no one should be worried about it.
The President was speaking at the Election rally at Akuressa, campaigning for the victory of UPFA candidates vying for the upcoming Local Government polls.
Ever since I took a decision to seek a clarification from the Supreme Court over my term in office, both the media and political parties have been speculating about it, the President said.
I wish to stress that I am ready to give up the Presidency even today.
The President reiterated that he was not power hungry and had no desire to remain in the Presidency for long.
I have never interfered with the affairs of the judiciary, the President said. We were able to ensure the freedom of the judiciary and the rule of law to prevail within the last three years.
He added that he was duty bound to rid the country from the shackles of corruption and steer it on the path of prosperity. I want to make this dream a reality and I am committed to carrying out this task.
President Sirisena added that an SLFP victory at the upcoming election is a foregone conclusion .
I had a dream for over 35 years which is the Moragahakanda irrigation project which I was able to make a reality. The main issue this country is facing and the main impediment to the growth of the country and its economy are corrupt politicians, he said.

IMF praises govt's fiscal performance
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday praised the government on its fiscal performance.
It said that the performance under the programme has remained broadly on track since the second review despite a series of weather related shocks.
This was also reflected in the country achieving a Rs 21.9 billion surplus in the primary balance of the fiscal accounts during the first 10 months of the year 2017, for the first time in 63 years.
Releasing its staff report pertaining to the third review of the Extended Arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility with Sri Lanka yesterday, the Fund looked at Sri Lankas performance over the three year term of its Extended Fund Facility (EFF) which started in June 2016.
On December 6, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the third review of Sri Lankas economic performance under the program and thereafter enabled the disbursement of US$ 251.4 million, bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to the equivalent of US$ 759.9 million.
The staff review however warned that Sri Lanka was still vulnerable to shocks, given its high level of debt and high debt repayments starting this year. They asked that the Central Bank on the monetary policy front maintain a tightening bias to contain inflation and rein in credit growth, especially private sector credit growth which still remained high.
The IMF also observed that structural reforms in State Owned Enterprises was still slow, and that it was important that the government take steps in restructuring important SOEs; such as the national carrier. The need for standard energy pricing, in the form of an energy/fuel formula was also highlighted by the IMF.
The government last year announced that they would finalise an energy pricing formula by March of this year. It is important to build on the progress made and accelerate reforms to reduce fiscal and external vulnerabilities, noted the IMF in their release.
Further identifying risks to the economy, the IMF noted, Political cohesion of the coalition government may be strained in the run-up to the 2020 national elections- a risk both to the economy and EFF programme.

India seek intent to combat
Centurion, Thursday: Indian captain Virat Kohli wants his batsmen to "show intent" when they come up against South Africas fast bowlers again in the second Test starting at Centurion on Saturday.
"You can't just stand there and take whatever is coming your way and not have intent," Kohli said after his team were beaten by 72 runs in the first Test in Cape Town.
"You might get out but it's important to keep coming at the bowler and making them feel, 'if you make an error I am going to score.
With conditions at Centurion again likely to favour fast bowling, the problem for India is not just how they should execute Kohlis strategy - but who should do it.
No Indian top-order batsman made more than 28 in either innings in Cape Town. The only two scores above 30 were 93 by Hardik Pandya in the first innings and 37 by Ravichandran Ashwin in the second.
Pandya and Ashwin were batting at number seven and eight respectively, which suggests India have enough depth in their batting order - if their top-order players can get themselves through the new ball.
At least two batting positions will be debated as the tourists seek a way to play themselves back into the three-Test series.
Left-handed opener Shikhar Dhawan fell to short-pitched deliveries in both innings and there is an argument for Lokesh Rahul to take his place, while Ajinkya Rahane must be a contender to replace Rohit Sharma at number five.
Kohli said the selection for Cape Town was based on form. Rahane had a dismal recent series against Sri Lanka but has shown the ability to score runs away from home.
On Indias 2013/14 tour of South Africa Rahane scored 47, 15, 51 not out and 96 in the two Test matches and looked one of the best-equipped Indian batsmen against pace.
South Africa, meanwhile, look set to once again pick a four-pronged pace attack, although they have to replace the injured Dale Steyn.
There are three candidates - two out-and-out pace specialists in Duanne Olivier and Lungi Ngidi or Chris Morris who has batting skills as well as the ability to bowl at more than 140 kmh.
Both teams showed batting fragility in Cape Town, with Indias pace bowlers showing they too could take advantage of helpful conditions.
AB de Villiers aggression in innings of 65 and 35 was a key factor for South Africa. It is that sort of intent that both teams will be seeking in what promises to be another action-paced Test. AFP
Likely teams:
South Africa: Faf du Plessis (capt), Dean Elgar, Aiden Markram, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, Quinton de Kock, Vernon Philander, Chris Morris or Duanne Olivier or Lungi Ngidi, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Morne Morkel.
India: Virat Kohli (capt), Murali Vijay, Shikhar Dhawan or Lokesh Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara, Rohit Sharma or Ajinkya Rahane, Hardik Pandya, Wriddhiman Saha, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammad Shami, Jasprit Bumrah.

## Title: Jim Laker takes 19 wickets in match, 1956

Jim Laker takes 19 wickets in match, 1956
It is 31 July 1956. Old Trafford, Manchester. Len Maddocks is rapped on the pad and, after a pregnant pause, Emrys Davies comes out of his squat and jabs his finger towards the batsman. After more than 150 second-innings overs, England have finally sealed victory and the exhausted bowler takes his sweater from the umpire and strides from a pitch now bathed in sunshine. A few team-mates offer hearty handshakes, others a pat on the back in reward for a fine Tests work. But this has not been merely a fine Test for Jim Laker. From more than 50 years hence the formal congratulations seem almost comically muted, for he is walking off the pitch having taken all 10 Australian wickets in the innings and in doing so recorded the finest bowling figures of all time  19 for 90.
That clean sweep in the second innings has been repeated once  by Anil Kumble in 1999  but Lakers figures remain top of the pile and the match figures remain a giant leap ahead of the best of the rest. No one had taken 19 in a match before, no one has since, and its quite likely that no one ever will again.
Laker had already given warning of what John Arlott called his ruthless destroying vein. Six years earlier in a trial match against a side of young England hopefuls (which included Peter May, David Sheppard and eight others who would go on to play Test cricket) Laker had been first change at the Pavilion End at Bradfords Park Avenue ground. In 14 overs of off-spin on the sticky dog of a pitch he conceded two singles. And took eight wickets. The side of Englands best young hopes were all out for 27. Lakers figures read: 14-12-2-8.
And he had shown that vein again against the Australians in the summer of 1956. On 16 May Surrey had taken on the tourists at The Oval. Laker was handed the ball at 12.20pm on the first day and bowled unbroken until the end of the tourists innings, little more than half an hour before the end of play. By that time his figures read 46-18-88-10.
Even so, no one was expecting history to repeat itself in a proper Test. The odds would be incalculable, writes Don Mosey in his book, Laker: Portrait of a Legend. No one, no matter how fertile his imagination, how burning his ambition, how iron-clad his confidence, could possibly visualise such a double. But Jim Laker did it.
Australia had seen their 19-year hold on the Ashes ended in 1953 and been somewhat battered on home soil by Len Huttons tourists in 1954-55. This was not the dominant Australian team of the immediate postwar era, but still one stacked with talent. The first Test at Trent Bridge was a draw, the second, on a seaming green top at Lords, went to Australia, but in a rain-affected third Test at Headingley England levelled the series. Laker was certainly troubling the Australians in the wet  his match figures at Leeds read 11 for 113.
But there were, initially at least, mixed views about the pitch at Old Trafford, with one ex-player who scored a run or two in Ashes matches expecting it to be batsman-friendly. The evening before the game, Laker wandered out to take a look at the Old Trafford pitch and bumped into Don Bradman, no longer part of the Australian side but doing some media work during the series. Flat and slow, said Bradman. With plenty of runs on it.
By the end of the second day, the Australian view of the pitch was very different, but by lunch on day two England accumulated 459 and Australias spinners had laboured for a day and a half with very little joy. Ian Johnson had taken four wickets at a cost of 151 runs, Richie Benaud two for 123.
Australias reply began steadily, with Colin McDonald and Jimmy Burke putting on 48 for the opening wicket. The England spinners Laker and Tony Lock had been bowling in tandem but had enjoyed as little success as the Australian pair. That was until just before tea, when Peter May opted to switch the pair around, and Laker began bowling from the Stretford End.
McDonald was first to go, bowled Laker, caught Lock, but perhaps the key wicket was the next, that of Neil Harvey. That Shane Warne delivery that bowled Mike Gatting, well, that wasnt in the same class, said Harvey, the left-hander who was clean bowled for a duck by one that pitched on leg and hit the top of off. From round the wicket. I never faced a better ball than that.
Brian Scovell, in his biography of Laker, puts forward the theory that with tea coming so soon after that delivery, panic spread like wildfire in the Australian dressing room. Laker said years later that: I am not being boastful when I said that ball won the series.
After the break wickets came in a deluge, with Lock taking that of Burke and Laker the other seven. Australia were utterly flummoxed and collapsed from 48 without loss to 84 all out. Lakers figures read 16.4-4-37-9. England enforced the follow on, but once more Australia dug in to reach 53 for one by the close, the only wicket to fall that of Harvey who, still fuddled by his dismissal less than two hours earlier, patted his first ball, an ugly pie of a full toss, straight to Colin Cowdrey at silly mid-on.
Lakers achievements in that second day seem to have been a touch overshadowed at the time by the furore surrounding the pitch. Arthur Morris wrote in the Daily Express: I complain, not on behalf of Australia but on behalf of cricket, that the pitch was not properly prepared for a match of this kind. Benaud later opined that it was a terrible pitch but a terrible pitch on which England made 459, but he also added that the Australian batting in the first innings had been to put the very best light on it, abysmal.
Much of the debate at the time and since has surrounded the question of whether the pitch was deliberately doctored to suit Englands spin twins  much of the Australian side were convinced that it had been, though the groundsman Bert Flack long denied it. Even now it is hard to say for sure and, whether there had been skulduggery or not, it should not be allowed to overshadow Lakers achievement, although it has been suggested that the pitch was inadvertently and needlessly watered in the week prior to the Test.
Still, Laker did at least get the medias attention too. On Friday evening he boarded the train for Warrington and the team hotel. His wife, Lilly, unaware of his feats at Old Trafford, met him at the snapper-swarmed station platform with the words: Good Lord  what have you been doing
On the following day only 45 minutes were possible because of the rain, but that was all that Laker needed to take the wicket of Burke. Sunday, the rest day, was gloomy and grey but by Monday the rain had ceased, and the uncovered pitch, which had been a dustbowl on the opening two days, was as wet as an otters pocket. Cold winds replaced the rain and only an hours play was possible with Australia edging to 84 for two.
That gave England only the final day to take eight wickets and with them an unassailable 2-1 lead in the series. Tuesday morning was fine and dry and on a lifeless pitch the tourists added another 28 runs before lunch. Then came the sun and with it the alchemy that turned the track, like that Bradford pitch six years previously, into a sticky dog. It started on sand and it finished up on mud, said McDonald of the track. Laker took full advantage.
The collapse was not quite as precipitous as that in the first innings, with Australia this time slumping from 114 for two to 205 all out, but Lakers bowling remained magical. There were people trying to get down the track to him, people trying to play him off the back foot, people trying to smother the spin, said Benaud. We had thought long and hard about it and we were trying everything we knew.
It was to no avail. The wickets tumbled to Laker as, at the other end, Lock pushed his deliveries through faster and faster in frustration. Odd as it may seem now, I did not even consider the possibility of taking all 10 wickets, said Laker. How could I when Tony was fizzing the ball through against nine, 10 and jack with venomous lift and spin. But that fizzing was part of the problem  while Lock bowled too eagerly, Laker maintained his relaxed flow, giving the ball time enough to grip and bounce.
The leg trap snapped shut time and time again, with Alan Oakman and Lock gobbling up five catches between them. Finally, in Lakers 52nd over, came the 10th, with Maddocks trapped in front. He finished with barely-believable second-innings figures of 51.2-23-53-10 and those epic, history-making match figures of 19 for 90.  theguardian

KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP:
Kandy SC take on CR at Nittawela
Kandy Sports Club will take on CR & FC at Nittawela today in what promises to be a good game for the defending champions who have won all their matches in the inter league competition. Kandy SC are technically capable of winning the game at home and are at virtual full strength with a pack and half backs that will put the opponents to the test. Kandy SC plans to name a strong side and a more experimental line-up at home. The play of the forwards has been particularly impressive. These forwards have delivered arguably their best performance in the last eight games. CR & FC who are placed fourth in the table failed to produce a good display in their last game against Sri Lanka Police. The Red shirts will struggle to give their best in this game as it will be a tough one against a Kandy SC side who are an extremely strong physically.
Hockey gold for Trinity
The Trinitians led by K.M. Jayalath remained unbeaten with three wins and a draw to win the Golden Star award at the 17th inter-school under 14 hockey tournament where 40 boys teams were in action.

Kandy Football League in a bad state
It is learnt that Kandy Football League has been suspended from their activities because they have failed to hold their Annual General Meeting last year. The officials of Kandy Football had been summoned on many occasions to the FFSL headquarters. Kandy was once a powerhouse of Sri Lanka club football but today it is on the decline
Billiards and Snooker not promoted the correct way
Billiards and Snooker a onetime popular sport in Kandy is now in the doldrums with no one showing any interest. The game is not promoted in the way it should be. At one time the game of Billiards and Snooker was the number one recreational sport for many people here, but has sadly declined in recent times. Today at club level, the game is dead. Kandy YMMA one time a leading cue club does not seem to be interested. Kings Cue Club which earned a name through cue sport is no more. In the good old days every hotel which had a public bar had tables like Royal, Castle, Victory, but no longer. Today the game is popular only at parlours. Only clubs like Mahanuwara YMBA the most active club in the game and Public Services Club are active. Other clubs like University Recreation Club, Kandy Club, and Kandy Garden Club have tables for their members to play the game but surprisingly there are no tournaments. Some clubs use the cue room as their store room and play billiards and snooker to get the liquor permit. This is cue sport in Kandy.
Sachintha, first centurion for Rajans
Sachintha Senanayake became the first centurion of Dharmaraja College in the 2017/18 inter school cricket season; when he scored an unbeaten 104 against Wesley College. He is a left handed batsman who bats one or two down. He led the Rajans at under 13, 15 and 17 and has been coached by Ananda Wijesekera and Senaka Dissanayake. He missed couple of games due to examinations. Much is expected from him this season in the remaining games.

Trinity College went down to St. Johns College Jaffna in the under 13 Division II quarter finals. The winners will meet Royal College B in the quarters. Trinity B 160 and St. Johns A 170 for 6.
Kandy remembers Roy
Former National Olympic Committee and Sri Lanka Hockey Federation chief Roy de Silva who passed way at the age of 80 an year ago on 9 January is remembered. He was a gifted sportsman and promoter and a product of Kandy from Kingswood College. Only a handful would remember the role played by him to uplift sport. Roy was one of the finest sportsmen to come out of Kingswood College and also Kandy where he excelled at hockey, football, athletics and cricket. Hockey was his pet sport at school and even later after leaving school he played for Kandy Whites and was an automatic choice for the Kandy District and Up-Country teams whenever they played against foreign sides. He also took to hockey umpiring and helped his school in coaching. At one time he was rated as one of the top umpires. Roy also played cricket as a right-arm spinner for Kandy United S.C. He was NOC president for 14 years.
Navin made his last journey on Wednesday
Family and friends paid their final respects to Kandys young carrom star Navin Kalansuriya who made his last journey on Wednesday. His burial took place at the Mahaiyawa General cemetery. The former St. Sylvesters College carrom star was a well-loved person in his village and school. This 20 year old carrom player met with a tragic death while travelling in the train. It will be a great loss for the carrom game and will be sadly missed by many.

Lets be thankful to natures bountiful supply - PM
Thai Pongal is celebrated by Tamils all over the world as an occasion of considerable religious significance,states Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a Thai Pongal message.
The message adds: As a festival that commemorates the harvest, it is also an occasion to be thankful to nature for the bountiful supply.
The agrarian society possesses a deep reverence for the Sun God that goes back to centuries. The Thai Pongal Festival personifies this tradition with meaning by consecrating the first fruits to the Sun God who enables a rich harvest every year. The animals who contribute towards a successful crop are also taken into account at Thai Pongal.
These vibrant traditions reinforce the close bonds between man and nature in a meaningful way.
Thai Pongal Festival confirms to us the blessings of being at peace with nature and the value of equality; it helps us to ponder on being thankful for everything nature has provided for us.

As Tamils all over the world celebrate this special day, they join hands with all Sri Lankans in a poignant message of goodwill among all.
May this Thai Pongal Day be a time to reflect on our respect for nature and an opportunity to share fellowship as an equal society.
I wish all a blessed Thai Pongal Day.

Over 150,000 Apura farmer families in need of drought relief
The drought, despite a few showers experienced during the late monsoon rains, is continuing in the Anuradhapura district.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that water levels of 13 major tanks in the district, which slightly increased due to rains, are now dropping again. No tank had reached the spill level except for around 25 to 30 minor irrigation tanks.
Over 150,000 farmer families are still in need of drought relief for sustenance in the Anuradhapura district. It was envisaged to cultivate paddy in 130,204 hectares under major irrigation schemes, minor irrigation small tanks, medium scale tanks which covers 27,440 hectares and 16,302 hectares in the Mahaweli H area and rain-fed areas.
Only 70,000 hectares have been cultivated during this 2017/2018 Maha season. It has been estimated that only 55 percent of the targeted landscape is under paddy cultivation.
Referring to the 2017/18 Maha seasonal additional crops cultivation in 55,000 hectares, mainly maize, chili, undhu and kurakkan, Anuradhapura Government Agent Wanninayake said farmers have succeeded only in growing additional crops in 16,000 hectares which is around 29 percent of the target. He said in consideration of the water levels of tanks, a maximum of three water turns could be released from major tanks, after maintaining a water level sufficient for drinking purposes.
There are no signs of rain. The farmers are facing many challenges in managing their livelihood. Under the circumstances, we will extend the distribution of free dry food rations to 150,000 farmer families.
I have instructed divisional secretaries to be on vigilance about families eligible for dry food rations but being deprived of the facility due to oversight or as a result of prolongation of the drought for extending the livelihood support to them, he said.
Also, Grama Niladharis have been instructed to look into the scarcity of drinking water in their divisions to start the distribution of drinking water from bowsers again. Two months ago, 35,000 families in 18 DS divisions were provided drinking water using a fleet of bowsers, he added.
Wanninayaka said for the distribution of free dry food rations bags, around Rs. 720 million is required per round.

People have not benefitted from wheat flour tax reduction - MP
Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeygunawardana yesterday said that political parties in the government are divided following President Maithripalas decision to seek a Supreme Court interpretation over his term of office.
He said that the government took the people for a ride by introducing 19th Amendment to the Constitution. What has happened to the independent commissions established under the 19th Amendment to the Constititution, he queried.
Addressing a press conference organized by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna at former President Mahinda Rajapaksas election office in Battaramulla, Abeygunawardena said the government removed the import tax on wheat flour by Rs. 9 per kilo but the people did not receive the benefit. The government loses an income of Rs.18 billion with the removal of import tax on wheat flour. But the price of wheat flour were not reduced in the open market, he said.
Abeygunawardena replying a statement made by Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya, said that the members of the Rajapaksa family will never betray their relatives or the people with an aim of amassing money or positions. Ratnapura district MP Pavithra Devi Wanniarachchi said the government has failed to maintain proper fiscal management in the country even after two years in office.

There will also be a tournament for the juniors of the Memon Community where four teams will take part. Killer Cleats. Memon Knight Riders, Seven Buddies and United 7s who will play in a round robin basis and the first two teams will play in the final.
Speaking at the occasion, the founder president of Colombo FC and promoter of football in Sri Lanka, Saif Yousuf thanked Shifan for taking the initiative to organize this tournament amongst the small community of Memons in Sri Lanka and making sure it does not die.
He also stated: Our community is a small one but very much Sri Lankan first and Memons is something we identify our roots, language, our culture, history, religion and where it came from. Although we are a small community we got ten wonderful teams to showcase itself. Having ten teams from the same community to play in Futsal I am extremely proud and happy to be part of it and assure to support this to continue in the future as well.

Thai Pongal helps protect ancient traditions - President
I am extremely happy to convey my greetings to all the Hindus across the world celebrating Thai Pongal, the festival that expresses gratitude to the nature, states President Maithripala Sirisena in a Thai Pongal message.
The message adds: Since the dawn of civilisation, the importance of agriculture was widely known to human beings. In a background of the rural community migrating to urban areas abandoning agricultural farming to obtain material benefits from industrial and technological growth, the celebration of Thai Pongal depicts the ardent desire to protect and cherish ancient traditions to refill humanity with culture, kindness, peace and reconciliation with utmost devotion towards fellow human kind.
I would like to consider the Thai Pongal festival, which has bestowed the supreme status upon agriculture, as an occasion to make the efforts taken by the government to take the country towards self-sufficiency in food meaningful and providing strength to these efforts.
The Tamil community following Hinduism considers the Thai Pongal festival as the dawn of their New Year which provides new expectations and opportunities.
On this auspicious day. I wish a happy and prosperous Thai Pongal to the Hindus in Sri Lanka and abroad.
I also join with the devotees who celebrate the Thai Pongal festival closely associating with the deep values of agricultural traditions and customs.

Thai Pongal honours God Sun for bringing prosperity -John Amaratunga
Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga extends his best wishes to Hindu devotees on the occasion of Thai Pongal.
Offering the tribute to the God Sun, who brought the prosperity and offering gratitude to the animals that assisted to fertilise the harvest are special rituals on the Thai Pongal day, the Minister pointed out.
According to the faith of the Hindu devotees, the God Sun with his happiness will bless the people for a prosperous life. The Hindu devotees expect to live without any physical or mental affliction, with the blessing of the rituals performed on the Thai Pongal day, he said.
The Thai Pongal day is esteemed among the people as a valuable occasion which demonstrates the long term relationship between the nature and the humans.
The Sri Lankan community which expects the prosperity through an agricultural lifestyle has a strong closeness with the Thai Pongal celebration. I wish the determination of the Hindu to fertilise the life with reconciliation and the peace accepting the blessings rendered with the dawn of the Sun on the first day of the month of Duruthu with the transition of the dragon be meaningful with the Thai Pongal Celebration.
May all receive prosperity through the blessing of the God Sun!, the message says.

'Today's journalists are clueless'
"Today's journalists do not know where they are or who they are. They belong to nowhere," , Senior Lecturer in Mass Media attached to Sri Palee Campus, University of Colombo Dr. Liyanage Tudor Weerasinghe said
"They think that they are close to politicians when they are with them and they think that they are close to the people when they are with them. The reality is they belong to nowhere and stand in the middle," he said.
He was addressing the gathering at the book launch of Sugath Ratnayake's first `Information Revolution and News' at the Sri Lanka Library Services Board, Colombo yesterday.
Dr. Weerasinghe said the real position of journalists could be described through an example. "They think that they are the head of the house, but they are not. `News' is actually not news today and they are only `fake news and `post news'. They are different from the actual meaning of news according to the theories in Journalism," he said.
"The media select certain problems and made them real. But the real problems of the people are not what shows on the television. The people recognise the identity of a television channel through its news telecast. The news telecast shows the stand of the relevant television/radio channel," he said.
He said the media has no text books, but all the other subjects have. "The `post truth' has become a very important topic today. "Any opposition try to grab power and does not need to change the system," he said.

## Title: Treating heart attacks with photosynthetic bacteria

Treating heart attacks with photosynthetic bacteria
In a study published on June 14, 2017 in Science Advances, Dr. Woo and his team show how they successfully replaced blood with microsocopic cyanobacteria, plant-like organisms that also use photosynthesis. By co-opting the process to help heal damaged heart tissue, the team was able to protect rats from deadly heart failure. Fixing an ailing heart, it seems, may be as simple as shining a light on the situation.
Heart disease is the number one killer worldwide. It happens when something blocks blood flow to the heart, cutting off oxygen from reaching this crucial muscle.
For cardiologists, the challenge for preventing subsequent heart failure is to rapidly supply damaged heart tissues with oxygen and nutrients. If we look at nature, photosynthesis answers that question.
If a damaged heart were photosynthetic, it wouldn't need to rely on blood to resupply oxygen and sugar to its tissues. All it would need was the sun. You would enable light to become your fuel source, instead of blood. Researchers tried the next best thing: injecting it with plant-like bacteria.
Dr Woo and his team started by grinding up kale and spinach to harvest chloroplasts, the organelles within plant cells that carry out photosynthesis. They were trying to separate out the chloroplasts, the photosynthetic organelles within each plant cell, but found that once isolated, they quickly became inactive. That's when the researchers learned about Synechococcus elongatus, a photosynthetic organism that Golden and other researchers have long used to study circadian rhythms. It has been used recently to produce biofuels, but this may be the first time the cyanobacteria have ever been used in a medical setting. What researchers needed instead were self-contained photosynthetic machines, would could function as miniature greenhouses for the heart.
Cyanobacteria, the tiny organisms, make a living by taking in carbon dioxide and water and spitting out oxygen. In the ocean, they're at the base of the food chain, making the oxygen and sugar that's quickly exploited by other hungry organisms. With help from Stanford microbiologists, Dr. Woo and his team grew a strain of Synechococcus in their lab and injected to the impaired heart tissue of a living rat.
Then, they turned up the lights. After 20 minutes, they saw increased metabolism in damaged areas. Overall cardiac performance improved after about 45 minutes. The evidence suggested that the oxygen and sugar Synechococcus created through photosynthesis was enhancing tissue repair.
After injecting living bacteria into a body organ, you might expect an infection. But interestingly, the researchers didn't find any immune response after a week of monitoring. The bugs are just not there any more; it disappears, says Dr. Woo. And maybe that's the best kind of bacteria - a friendly helper that sticks around to do damage control, then disappears without a trace.
One potential problem with making this procedure a viable treatment is its timing and complexity. Treating heart attacks is a race against the clock, and by the time patients are transferred to a special facility equipped to inject cyanobacteria to the heart, it might be too late. It requires a tremendous amount of investment and technology.
However, the fact that the researchers still saw healthier hearts in rats that underwent treatment after a month could be a promising result. If everything goes the way researchers want it, it would be a huge therapy for people who have had heart attacks.
Dr. Woo and his team reason that Synechococcus balances a chemical equation upended by a heart attack. Using light as fuel for food may be a novel concept for a human heart, but it's old hat for cyanobacteria in their natural habitats.
The recent study is merely proof-of-concept, but scientists are now on the path to trying the technique in human subjects. Next they'll try it in larger animal models that are closer to humans, and they're working on ways to deliver and shine light on cyanobacteria without an open heart surgery. They're even considering genetically editing Synechococcus to make the critters release more sugar.
For many cardiologists, the root of the problem lies not in managing heart attacks after they occur, but in preventing them in the first place.
While these data provide a new and possibly efficacious way to preserve cardiac function after an acute heart attack; the main drawback is, of course, that the SE bacteria must be exposed to light to undergo photosynthesis. While the technique of using some form of SE bacteria is certainly still in the preliminary stages, it is an innovative means of improving heart function and perhaps preventing the damage to the heart muscle consequent on an interruption of blood flow.

Trump blackmails world with nuclear war
The United States while accusing and threatening North Korea with nuclear war for developing its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programme has itself outlined new measure to develop its nuclear weapon arsenal which is several hundred times larger and more potent than that of North Korea.
This became evident from the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) that has been prepared by the Pentagon for President Trump. The NPT is a set of recommendations on nuclear weapons policy issued every eight years. President Trump is expected to make the NPR public during his State of The Union Address that would be delivered at the end of this month.
Jon Wolfsthal, who was special assistant to Barack Obama on arms control and nonproliferation reviewing the NPC, says that it envisages the development of two new types of nuclear weapons and the removal of present restrictions on the use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear attacks. One is to develop a new low-yield nuclear warhead for US Trident missiles with the intention of deterring Russia from using tactical warheads in a conflict in Eastern Europe.
According to Wolfsthal the modified Trident warhead, with just the primary (fission) part of its thermonuclear warhead, was totally unnecessary as the US already has low-yield weapons, B61 gravity bombs and air-launched cruise missiles, in its arsenal.
The United States also proposes to reintroduce a sea-launched nuclear cruise missile, as a counter to a new ground-launched cruise missile the US has accused Russia of developing in violation of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. The latter has denied the accusation.
Hans Kristensen, the director of the nuclear information project at the Federation of American Scientists, says that justification for developing the new weapons is illogical: It assumes that the intelligence community has determined that one or several adversaries out there are gambling that the US would be self-deterred from using a ballistic missile warhead because they have larger yield.
Thats just not the case. We have never, ever heard anyone say that is so.
Commenting on the suggestion to use low-yield nuclear weapons in response to non-nuclear attacks Daryl Kimball, the head of the Arms Control Association, development of new weapons in the US nuclear arsenal was dangerous, Cold War thinking.
Korean peninsula: Talks reduce tension
Talks between North and South Korea has reduced tensions in the Korean peninsula and North East Asia, which faced the threat of even a nuclear conflagration few weeks ago with both Presidents Trump and Kim practicing brinkmanship diplomacy.
The talks took place in the border truce village of Panmunjom, where the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, and became the first high-level dialogue to take place between the two sides in over two years.
At the talks officials from North and South Korea agreed to hold military negotiations to defuse the border issue reopen a military hotline in the Yellow Sea District and activate exchanges in diverse areas. The negotiations also resulted in the decision of North Korea to send its athletes to the Winter Olympic Games in South Koreas Pyeongchang.
According to South Korean media South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman Noh Kyu-duk has said that Seoul would consider the possibility of weakening sanctions against North Korea during the Winter Olympics.
The nuclear weapon issue was not discussed as North Korea says it is targeting the United States only. According to the North Korean News Agency prior to the talks, in a New Year Address North Korean President Kim Jong Un has said, It is not worth stirring up the past and recalling the specifics of relations with Seoul. Instead of this, relations between the North and South must be improved It is not only about the normalization of the inter-Korean relations, but about the reconciliation of the nation and its free-will unification.
However, re-unification is a long and complex process which did not figure in the talks. The talks concentrated on smaller issues such as the Winter Olympics and family reunions.
North Korea would require several guarantees before engaging in unification talks. They include the continuation of the nuclear development programme, the withdrawal of US troops from the Korean peninsula and the ending of US-South Korea defense cooperation.
While South Korea wants a peaceful resolution of its conflict with the North, policies pursued by Washington and the pressure it exerts on the South could derail the dialogue between the two Koreas. This is especially so in view of the insulting and intimidating policies of President Trump despite his readiness to meet President Kim in direct talks.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that the United States would not be easing its pressure on North Korea. Our policy with North Korea has not changed. Were fully committed to continuing to apply maximum pressure and working with all of our partners in the region, including South Korea, who we have a better relationship with now than ever before, Sanders said. Meanwhile, China and Russia have welcomed the talks.

UNP wins all LG authorities in Monaragala: Madduma Bandara
"The United National Party (UNP) is campaigning in Moneragala to win 10 local government institutions in the district," Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said.
He said the UNP would secure a victory over the other parties including the 'lotus bud', betel, and hand among others.
He was addressing a rally in Ethimale in Moneragala.
Minister Bandara said that during the previous regime, politicians made an environment for the haves to flourish. "For this reason, the people brought about a change three year ago. Now we are working to enhance the economy of the rural people," he said.
He said the Pradeshiya Sabha members during the previous regime worked for contracts. not for the people. "The villages were not developed because of this reason. Those who were in the lotus bud and the betel leaf engaged in corruption during the previous regime," he said.
"Since the UNP government's Gam Uda project, people of Monaragala have not received anything," Minister Bandara said "Neither Sumeada nor Vijayamuni Zoysa has done nothing to Monaragala. But during the last three years, the area developed," he said.
He said the government reduced the prices of goods, medicine, and increased Samurdhi benefit. "No government granted those relief. The paddy and the maze farmers get a considerable price for their crops.
The UNP government will win 10 local government institutions in the Moneragala district since people appreciate government's efforts," he said.

Use textbooks with care: Education Minister
The Education Ministry encourages students to use school textbooks carefully, in order to use them for at least two years, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
The government spends millions of public funds to provide students with textbooks annually. A significant amount of the huge public wealth utilized for providing textbooks can be saved if textbooks are used at least for two years.
It is not an impossible target if students are motivated to use textbooks with care, he said.
He made these remarks participating in the school textbook distribution national programme on Thursday at D.S. Senanayake College, Colombo.
The minister added that not only students but also education authorities are duty-bound to protect textbooks with care, making children use them for at least another one year. Then the money saved from well-utilized textbooks can be used for the development of other areas of the education sector.
The Education Ministry will take steps to complete Ordinary Level Examination activities within December itself. Accordingly, paper marking activities will also be conducted during December so as to minimize the hindrance caused by the O/L Examination to academic activities. Under this, the examination activities, including the paper marking process, will be streamlined, he said.

Will Federer be made to sweat at Aussie Open
The waiting is almost over for tennis fans. The Australian Open, the first grand slam of the 2018 season, starts Monday with everyone wondering if Roger Federer can repeat his remarkable victory 12 months ago.
The Swiss will be gunning for a 20th grand slam title, but following Thursday's draw, the heat will be on for the 36-year-old in Melbourne.
Federer has a seemingly simple opener against 51st-ranked Slovenian Aljaz Bedene, but he might be made to sweat after that.
The world No. 2 has landed in the trickier half of the draw, where Novak Djokovic, Stan Wawrinka, Alex Zverev, Dominic Thiem, Tomas Berdych and Gael Monfils all potentially await.
Federer will also have to contend with Milos Raonic and Juan Martin del Potro in his section of the draw, and may have to beat David Goffin to reach the semifinals -- an opponent he lost against at the year-ending ATP Finals in November.
"I thought my game wasn't going to be good enough for that day and it was," Federer recalled of his epic 2017 final against Nadal.
"That fifth set against Rafa was maybe the best set I've ever played. It was definitely my highlight of 2017."
Rafael Nadal, last year's beaten finalist, is undoubtedly in the more favorable half and would avoid both Federer and Djokovic until the final.
The world No. 1 opens his campaign against 37-year-old Dominican Victor Estrella Burgos, while the biggest danger in his quarter of the draw is big-serving Croat Marin Cilic.
Six-time Australian Open winner Djokovic, who has dropped to 14th in the world after six months out with injury, will play American Donald Young and faces a potentially mouthwatering second-round match against Monfils.
Wawrinka, the 2014 champion, also makes his return from injury and is drawn against Lithuania's Ricardas Berankis, while world No. 3 and last year's semifinalist Grigor Dimitrov faces two undecided qualifiers in his opening rounds.

CAN MARIA TRIUMPH IN SERENA'S ABSENCE
Serena Williams may not be around to defend her title this year but sister Venus will be looking to go one better to claim a fifth singles title Down Under. 2017's beaten finalist is up against Belinda Bencic in the opening round. Elsewhere, all eyes will be on Maria Sharapova as she returns for only her second grand slam tournament since serving a drugs ban.
The 2008 champion and current world No. 47 kicks off her campaign against a player ranked one place higher, Germany's Tatjana Maria.The absence of reigning cha mpion Serena Williams, who last week said she is "not where I want to be" following the birth of her daughter in September, gives several other protagonists the chance to come to fore in the women's side of the draw. Williams remarkably revealed she was in fact two months pregnant when she won last year's title, beating older sister Venus in the final.
In a recent interview with Vogue, Serena revealed some of the severe health complications she suffered in the weeks after giving birth to Alexis Olympia.
She described how "everything went bad" after a flawless emergency cesarean section. What followed was a lung clot, clotted blood in her abdomen and more than one operation, before spending six weeks unable to get out of bed.
Venus, seeded fifth this year, will be hoping to go one better and kicks off her bid for an eighth grand slam title with a tricky match against rising Swiss star Belinda Bencic.
World No. 1 Simona Halep faces 17-year-old Australian wildcard Destanee Aiava in the first round and could potentially face 2014 semifinalist Eugenie Bouchard in the second.
Wozniacki claimed the biggest title of her career in the WTA Finals at the end of last year and will be hoping to now add a maiden grand slam to her name.
The Dane has been handed a kind first round draw and will face Romanian Mihaela Buzarnescu.
