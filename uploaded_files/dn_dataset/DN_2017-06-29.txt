India to invest Rs 1 bn in ECT
India has indicated an interest in investing over US$ 1 billion in the East Container Terminal (ECT) of the Colombo Port, along with other projects like the oil tank farm in Trincomalee, under a public-private partnership with the Sri Lankan government, said Minister of Foreign Affairs Ravi Karunanayake.
Making the opening address at the commencement of proceedings of the seminar on Emerging Issues in the Indian Ocean at a Foreign Policy Forum at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute, he said that Japan is also investing in key projects including in a LNG terminal (jointly with India) and is actively seeking more opportunities in Sri Lanka. China is investing over US$ 1.5 billion in building the Colombo Port and International Financial City (CIFC).
However it is worth noting that although China is a large investor in Sri Lanka, foreign direct investment from China in other regional economies like Laos, Cambodia and Malaysia is much higher than to Sri Lanka, he said.
He also said that novel thinking has to come to the Foreign Service. While thinking global, our foreign service must also act local by utilising strategies of para-diplomacy, the Minister said.
Just as India has done with its own diaspora, we must reach out to overseas Sri Lankans. They have networks and knowhow that we currently do not even appreciate, let alone leverage.
In 2013, the University of Moratuwa had the most number of student projects accepted by Googles Summer of Code programme for the seventh year running, beating all other universities in the world, including the National University of Singapore (which ranked in seventh place) and Peking University (which ranked ninth). Our IT professionals have created software for global clients like the London Stock Exchange.
Achievements like these can be multiplied if our foreign policy goes beyond formal diplomatic relations to establishing valuable people-to-people links with key partner economies.
Lankan missions abroad can assist the thousands of Sri Lankan students studying abroad, including in India and China, to obtain internships in high-growth companies and new industries. These students may then return to Sri Lanka with networks that they can tap. Even if they remain abroad, we can tap them for ideas, network introductions and other assistance.
If we want young innovators, we must be committed to a culture of innovation. We cant promise casual clothes and table tennis at our offices like in Silicon Valley, but we can start with new practices like an Ideas Lab, online and in person, and an open door policy. Many foreign service officers are already offering valuable suggestions, the Minister said.

Megapolis, new challenge for Lankan engineers
Projects such as the Megapolis, of which the implementation is about to start are great openings for Sri Lankan engineers to contribute, said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen at the 15th annual INCO 2017 Industrial Exhibition and Trade Fair concluded at BMICH last week.
Projects such as the Megapolis, Colombo Port expansion, development of the region around the Hambanthota port and the Colombo financial city supported by China are great openings for Sri Lankan engineers to contribute for development, Minister Bathiudeen said.
Many Sri Lankan engineers have come up with innovative designs and construction plans for these projects.
Marine engineers have greatly contributed to Colombo port expansion designs, he said. The Megapolis project which consists of a Tech City, a Logistics Area and a Marine Development Zone is one of the biggest challenges for Sri Lankan engineers.
Megapolis is expected to greatly modernize the Western province to attract large scale international investors as it is planned similar to Singapore but five times larger.
Even though the government wants to see more infrastructure development, it cannot always continue to fund large scale projects on its own. We need to enlist private sector as well and are planning to use Public Private Partnerships (PPP).
For PPP, to be successful, they need to be supported by skills and technologies. In fact enhancing technological and engineering skills in Sri Lanka is important for us to ensure success of PPPs that we will be using in future, he added.

Solar energy to take over future electricity generation
Solar energy is to become the go to energy source in Sri Lanka in future for electricity generation, Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said yesterday.
He said Power and Energy authorities will visit Pooneryn next week to work over the area for the construction of what would be the largest solar power project in the country.
The project in Pooneryn is to generate 800 Megawatts of power. The minister said moves are afoot by the ministry to accelerate and sustain public- private partnerships in solar energy.
the Cabinet has approved a proposal to build a hybrid energy park of 1,040 Megawatts in Pooneryn where the 800 Megawatt solar power plant would be built side by side with a 240 Megawatt wind power plant, said Minister Siyambalapitiya.
This is in line with the government policy to add a considerable amount of electricity to the national grid through renewable energy sources, said the Ministrys Development Director Sulakshana Jayawardena.
All in all, steps will be taken by the ministry to promote the use of solar power throughout the country. The Private sector is expected to play a prominent role in promoting solar panels for future domestic use, the minister said.
Meanwhile, moves are afoot by the ministry to call for offers from local and international solar power producers. Siyambalapitiya said open tenders would be called in August for the construction of the solar power plant in Pooneryn, he explained. There is a good chance that we could be able to reduce the price of a unit of electricity through the use of solar energy. A unit of solar energy could be purchased between Rs. 12.10 and Rs 23. 10 he added. "The most important thing is that we get the infrastructure and facilities built for the purpose, he said.
Asked if the ministry has acquired lands for the construction work, Siyambalapitiya said that they have identified the lands.
They are state lands. Therefore I do not expect that we have a hard task in acquiring them, he pointed out. We have got to find independent power producers to build the transmission system and necessary infrastructure, he said. A project like this could do a lot of good for the people who live in the North. It stands to produce job opportunities. The people will get new roads and communication facilities. It will boost their economies too, he said.

Yahapalana political culture encourages working together
The new political culture under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena encourages us to work together sans political difference to achieve development goals, said Uva Provincial Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayaka.
The Chief Minister made these comments at a meeting after opening a newly built busstand at Siyambalanduwa in Moneragala, Siyambalanduwa DS area on Monday. The Asian Development Bank under the Pura Neguma Development project earmarked Rs. 12 million for the construction of the new busstand.
Politicians should honour peoples decisions. They should get used to the new political culture to develop the country, the Chief Minister said. He said the political history of the country proves that no politician can remain in power forever as the public have the power to change regimes.
Uva Wellassa was the focal point of the vicious agenda of British rulers. They killed those who raised a voice against the British in 1818. In 2018, we are commemorating this event after 200 years, he said.
Minister Chamara said, We were able to re-build and there is more work to be done to develop this area.
He said, Siyambalanduwa was claimed to be one of the poorest DS areas in the 1980s. Now people experience a rapid development.
Floods, landslides and other natural disasters, except for the drought are not experienced by the people in this area. The government can provide infrastructure facilities to the people, he said.
The Chief Minister said South Korea and Singapore are examples for rapid development and that Sri Lanka too should strive to develop in the same manner. The Provincial Council takes all measures to develop the province to keep pace with national development, he said.
Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister Sumedha G. Jayasena, Uva Provincial Council Health Minister Kumarasiri Rathnayaka and others also spoke. Moneragala Deport Manager R. M. Atula Thushara Chaminda and others participated.

Bandarawela comes to a standstill
Thousands of people living in Bandarawela and the adjoining areas thronged to Bandarawela town to protest against the Uma Oya Multipurpose project yesterday. Shops were closed and transport in the town came to standstill as they launched a hartal demanding the suspension of the project.
They shouted slogans demanding the government to suspend the project as their houses are in danger of being caved in owing to the project. These protestors wearing black jackets with black flags lamented that they face severe shortage of water.
Black flags were displayed opposite every building of the town in protest of the project. The protestors later held a massive rally in the heart of Bandarawela town.
Addressing the rally, convenor of peoples movement against Uma Oya project Samantha Vidyarathna said that they will not leave the town until the authorities take action to halt the project immediately
Vidyarathna added that thousands of people living in the area are facing water shortage and their houses are on the verge of collapse.
We urged the government to stop this project without delay, he said
Ven Pallegama Gnanarathana Thera of Ginigama Dharmodaya Pirivena said that the people who were affected by the project should receive a compensation. The government should take action to minimize adverse impact on the people while ensuring compensation to then, he said.The Uma Oya Multipurpose project was proposed to divert 192 MCM of water annually to the Kirindi Oya to augment the Handapanagala and Lunugamwehera and Weheragala reservoirs by feeder channels in the lowlands.
Environmentalists say that no proper environmental assessment has been done before the project is implemented.
They allege that with the construction of the reservoirs and the tunnel, people living upstream of the planned tunnel are likely to suffer from water shortages.
Cracks are developing in many houses in Weheragalathenna, Makul Ella, Egodagama, Palleperuwa, Udaperuwa and Kurudugolla, Heel Oya, Boralanda and Kurudugolla in the Nuwara Eliya and Badulla districts.

## Title: That call to arms

That call to arms
The remark made by GMOA Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath that medical students would be forced to take up arms as a last resort if the SAITM issue was not resolved by the government should be treated by the authorities with the utmost seriousness. The statement is a clear challenge to the government, and what is more, an incitement (of the student community) to violence, an offence that could see the good doctor draw a long stretch behind bars.
There have been many calls for the arrest of the GMOA Secretary, not just from government politicians, but also other parties. The latest to add his voice to the chorus is Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya who has called on the IGP to arrest Dr. Herath since his statement amounted to inciting youth to take up arms against the state. He said the statement which says that undergraduates would take up arms as the next step in their agitation against SAITM should not be treated lightly and was a threat to national security and peace.
The authorities have so far failed to move in the matter, which, indeed, is surprising. Dr. Hearth, though, not explicitly calling upon the youth to take to arms had nevertheless planted the idea in the minds of a band of undergraduates with a propensity to violence. The statement could also have a domino effect, with the very real possibility of militant youth in the universities, and otherwise, taking to arms, plunging the country into a state of anarchy. With the doctors threatening another round of strikes amidst the current stalemate the law enforcement should be fully beefed up to tackle any eventuality that may arise as a result of Dr. Heraths incendiary statement.
The latest move by the government doctors to co-opt the parents of the medical students into the agitation campaign is clearly intended to make the anti-SAITM campaign snowball into an all out anti- government protest. The claim made by Dr. Neville Fernando that the university students who have been remanded were receiving Rs. 10 million should also be investigated. From the very inception of the protests we have been urging the government to unearth the nexus between the agitation and the political hand guiding it. We also said that there are all indications that big money was being pumped into the whole affair. The revelation made by Dr. Fernando therefore should provide food for thought to the government and compel it to unravel the subterranean plot that is obviously at work.
It is hardly a secret that the VVIPs of the former regime command unlimited financial resources that are now being put to good use. Had it not been the case they would not have been able to muster the massive crowds that almost filled Galle Face at the May Day. It is obvious that more of the same is today being channeled into mobilising university students to create chaos and disorder under the guise of an anti- SAITM offensive. The protests, naturally, are going to pick up as the days go by and reach a crescendo as the Provincial Council elections, due for September, draw near. This, coupled with the spate of doctors strikes that are bound to intensify in the coming days are craftily planned to obtain the maximum political advantage to the benefactors of the whole agitation campaign.
The government should be up to the task in countering this obvious conspiracy. The plan, it is clear, is to plunge the countrys hospitals into a major crisis, what with the dengue epidemic now spiralling out of control. Patients dying in hospitals, sans treatment, is a surefire way to rouse the anger of the general public against the government, which will be squarely held responsible for the crisis. It (government) should consider alternative options. It cannot allow this problem to continue indefinitely. Neither should it cave into threats and blackmail. As Dr. Neville Fernando recalled, a similar doctors strike was successfully dealt with by the then Minister Felix Dias Bandaranaike in his typically authoritarian manner. One also recalls the prolonged strike of all state banks during the tenure of Dr. N.M. Perera as Finance Minister. The government did not budge and many bank employees lost their jobs when new hands were recruited. Neither did JRJ cave in to the July strikers (Had he done so the wrong message would have been sent to foreign investors and the FTZ would never have come into being). Similarly, a firm hand is called for by the present government, Yahapalanaya notwithstanding.
Controversial lawyer and Presidents Counsel Hemantha Warnakulasuriya has suggested that the government get down doctors from India if the GMOA continues to dig in its heels. What has to be given thought to, no doubt is the lives, of the patients. That should be the bottom line. The cost, no doubt, would be prohibitive. It would be ironic, indeed, if the government is compelled to hire foreign doctors, at considerably cost, when the local doctors who had the privilege of free education, curtsy the state, had turned their backs on the patients.

Sri Lanka based Carbon Consulting Company (CCC) was accorded another global recognition when the United Nations (UN) Climate Change Secretariat awarded them Climate Neutral Now Champion status, elevating it to the same platform as other global sustainability solutions providers, such as UKs Natural Capital Partners, My Climate and The South Pole Group as well as multinational corporate sustainability leaders such as M&S, Aviva and Philips.
Climate Neutral Now is an initiative led by the UN Climate Change Secretariat. It encourages companies, organisations and individuals to contribute voluntarily to increase climate action globally, to limit the rise of global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and to tackle climate change. Participants of Climate Neutral Now commit to measure, reduce and offset their climate footprint.
The Climate Neutral Now initiative of the UN Climate Change Secretariat coordinator, Niclas Svenningsen welcomed CCC to the initiative.
Addressing at the event he stated that The Carbon Consulting Company, through its mission, is dedicated to provide advice to other companies to measure, reduce, and offset their greenhouse emissions to help society become climate neutral and to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
This is completely aligned with the goals of Climate Neutral Now. Our congratulations to The Carbon Consulting Company for its actions, which sets an example for other companies, he said. Speaking on the occasion, CCC, CEO Sanith de S. Wijeyeratne said, The mission of CCC to facilitate the creation of a cleaner and greener corporate environment actually predates the adoption of the UN Goals on Sustainable Development.
But the work we do in the sustainability sphere works in complete alignment with many of the SDGs.
We are proud and humbled that our work has been endorsed by the UN Climate Change Secretariat, which has confirmed that we are contributing towards the achievement of SDGs.
We have pledged to continue our efforts to bring more organisations on to the platform of climate neutrality through UN mandated offsets, and to get more organisations to align their efforts toward the SDGs.

China economy improves in second quarter
China's economy continued to improve in the second quarter, with corporate profits rising and hiring up, a private survey showed, but it suggested the Asian giant may have to brace for tougher times ahead even though firms have been able to weather a tighter financing environment.
The quarterly survey of thousands of Chinese firms by China Beige Book International (CBB) showed that while the property sector slowed, manufacturing improved further and the retail and services industries bounced back after a difficult first quarter.
That reinforced a flurry of recent data and policy makers' comments that indicated authorities were working to curb financial risks and keep the economy on an even keel heading into a key political meeting this year. The survey showed surprisingly strong performance in the commodities sector despite some price weakness in the second quarter, with the aluminium sector particularly strong.
The improving economy, especially the healthy labour market, is no doubt welcome news ahead of a leadership revamp at an autumn congress of the ruling Communist Party of China.
Yet signs of stress in the corporate sector pointed to a bumpy ride for businesses. CBB said cash flow was negative for many companies and inventory levels in the second quarter was at the highest in the history of the survey.
That is in line with official data showing growth in industrial inventories picked up to over 10 percent in April, sparking worries of weak demand.
CBB said there are signs tougher times could be ahead for Chinese companies during a period of deleveraging and rising interest rates.
"It remains true that either rates have to come plunging back down, as the (state planner) recently called for, or the present level of corporate activity is headed for a cliff," CBB said in its report.
As the government stepped up its campaign to curb debt risks and stabilise the financial sector, growth of China's broad money supply came in at the slowest in at least two decades in May, though bank lending remained solid.
The CBB survey showed the corporate sector started to feel the effect of tighter credit conditions in the second quarter after escaping relatively unscathed in the first three months of the year, with the cost to take a bank loan the highest since 2014. (Business News)

Sports Minister, translate your words into action
As a live active sportsman in field hockey for nearly 35 years, playing B and A division, having led two teams, the United Youngsters and the Colts, I appreciate your recent statements regarding, being too presumptuous and overweight.
We have had Olympic medalists who were humble in their achievements, and those who ran in Asian games, who have all faded away like old soldiers without being presumptuous.
Sri Lanka, being Sri Lanka, is the first in many things, the first to produce a pompous female athlete, who was given more than a heros welcome.
The politicians, dancing to her tune, gave her the impression that her achievement was the greatest for this country. She came out publicly and kept on cashing in on the slogan: I am from a poor background and our staple food was only jak (kos mallun) and rice. By this, she enhanced her popularity among the ordinary folk.
They donated a vehicle, a house and many other gifts. The Sports Minister went overseas to greet her and sprung so many stories, all at our expense. Later this minister was humiliated, claiming he went out of line. Mr Sports Minister, do not worry about the gallery remarks. This is expected from Sri Lanka, another first. Enforce your vision.
Yes sir, professional sports personalities whoever they are, must understand, without being told, that their physical fitness and appearance should be the priority, to inspire confidence. Unshaven beards, tinted hair grown to flutter in the wind, and show-off sunglasses and newfound caps and hats, and tattoos cannot improve the quality of the game. It only stirs the inner self, which can be a hindrance to the focus of the game. Sri Lanka has a conservative image. The representatives must just be that. They must stand tall, cut an impeccable image, a first step to winning. All these uncouth, ill-disciplined, factors are definitely contributory.
Players swollen-headedness and pomp steal the glamour from the game. It creates a physiological imbalance in their judgement. The juniors have a bad example to follow.
Come what may. Please set standards, not for cricketers alone, but to the entire sporting community who are funded by the state, and ensure that their expectations must be matched with performance.

Community water projects in the Matale district launched about two decades ago are now in a deplorable state creating a water scarcity in rural areas.
During the period, nearly 50 such water projects were initiated by the government with the assistance of foreign funds.
In the beginning, the projects were monitored by local government bodies. However, at present, they have stopped monitoring the projects after handing them over to community organizations. Thereafter, poor management of the projects and financial fraud had made some water projects inactive.
Therefore, the public request the government to rectify this issue as soon as possible.

Court orders progress report on Thajudeen case

The Colombo Chief Magistrate's ordered the CID today to submit a report in court on July 27 regarding the progress of the investigation into Wasim Thajudeen murder case.
When case came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate R.M.B.D.R. Weligodapitiya, two suspects former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake and former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera were present in Courts.
They were arrested over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeens murder and conspiring to commit a murder.
They are currently out on bail.
On July 27, 2015 the CID submitted to Court that the death of Thajudeen was not an accident but a murder.
While delivering the verdict, Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris on February 25, 2016 ruled that the death appeared to be a murder and ordered the CID Director to immediately arrest all suspects involved in the incident and produce them before Courts.
Thajudeen was killed, apparently, in a road accident in Colombo in May 2012. The CID informed court that investigations conducted so far revealed that Thajudeens teeth were broken, the bones in the pelvic region were also broken and his neck was pierced with a sharp instrument prior to his death.
The CID added that muscles in his legs were cut with a piece of a broken class.
Earlier, police maintained that Thajudeen was had lost control of his car while driving to the airport and crashed into the wall of Shalika Grounds at Park Road, Narahenpita.
In addition to this they said that his vehicle exploded within seconds after the crash.

ISSUES DUE TO IMPRUDENT DECISIONS OF PREVIOUS REGIME: dayasiri:
A ministerial subcommittee has been appointed to look into the issues that have arisen from the Uma Oya project in Baddulla district, Co- Cabinet Spokesman Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said. The subcommittee includes Ministers Mahinda Amaraweera, Patali Champika Ranawaka and Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa.
The consequences of the Uma Oya project are due to the imprudent decision making of the previous regime, Co-Cabinet spokesman Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said. Jayasekara further said that a ministerial subcommittee has been appointed to look into the issues arisen from the Uma Oya project in Badulla district.
Jayasekara was speaking at the Cabinet press briefing held at the Government Information Department yesterday.
He said Ministers Harin Fernando and Nimal Siripala de Silva, who represent the Badulla district have extensively spoken to the Cabinet regarding the Uma Oya issue. This project was initiated by the previous regime.Sri Lanka has taken a large volume of debts from Iran to this project as well.We need to pay these debts too.We cannot give up on this project, but it is problematic to continue with it as well, Jayasekara said. Minister Jayasekara said the Uma Oya project was started without following proper criteria. They should have considered that the project is situated in a densely populated area.These matters should have been asked then, not now.
Jayasekara also pointed out the adverse environmental conditions arising due to the project is mainly based on the machines employed for the project.
These machines are normally used in desert climates.When such mining is done, a drop in water level is unavoidable. According to the experts, it takes about two years to get the water levels back to normal, he said. Minister Jayasekara said, however much demanding the situation would be, the government will stand with the public and take decisions regarding the project for the best interest of the people.

Deuce to manure
Best solution for waste pollution:
Sri Lanka has done very well to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goal of increasing toilet access for its people: 99 percent of the population has access to some form of toilet. Unfortunately, there continues to be little consideration of how the human waste, or faecal sludge, that ends up in those toilets, is processed.
Only between 1.9 to 2.6 percent of Sri Lankans have access to traditional sewer systems, and the rest of the population depends on pit latrines and septic tanks for waste storage.
In and of themselves, these storage systems are not problematic, but it is worrisome that just 10 percent of the faecal sludge in these latrines and tanks is extracted by septic trucks. The other 90 percent of the sewage is sealed underground or disposed of in some way or another, and is often simply dumped in the surrounding environment, according to Dr. Sudarshana Fernando, a resource recovery and reuse expert at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI).
Such disposal methods are not ideal, as they can lead to groundwater and environmental contamination. Sri Lankans drink both ground and surface water, and it goes without saying that consuming polluted groundwater can lead to illnesses. Faecal contamination-related diseases are a major cause of hospitalizations across the country.
Despite that, traditional gravity sewer systems negate the aforementioned disposal difficulties, it is unlikely they will be adopted island-wide since they are so expensive. Studies have shown that increasing sewerage coverage is cost ineffective, as it is very difficult to operate the systems well enough to make up for the necessarily steep initial expenditures.
The government is, however, investing in expanding some sewer systems, and it expects 3.75 percent of the population to have access to sewers by 2020. The rest of the population, however, will continue to use septic tanks and pit latrines.
Instead of focusing investments in sewer systems, money should be spent to improve waste transport and disposal services for those who do not have access to sewers, according to Dr. Soumya Balasubramanya, a researcher in Environmental Economics at IWMI.
You have to think about the whole waste management chain. Its not just about the toilet. You have to consider what happens after the toilet fills up. You have to ask how do you pull the waste out, how do you transport it, where do you transport it to, and what do you do to treat it, she said.
According to IWMI researchers, just One percent of the countrys sewage is treated, and this is due to both transport and processing deficiencies, so Balasubramanyas questions are certainly pertinent. A financially feasible mechanism for emptying the pits and latrines and moving the sludge to treatment plants has not yet been found.
Though initially expensive, investment in waste management can pay massive dividends, especially for the poor. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that every dollar invested in sanitation yields an average benefit of $5.5, with the two main benefits being improved health and environmental outcomes. The importance of these for the poor cannot be overstated, as they spend less time being sick, less money on healthcare and more days earning money.
When the government puts money into improving sanitation and waste water disposal, it is distributionally progressive, said Balasubramanya.
But a central waste management problem is procuring sufficient investment for the necessary equipment and facilities to process waste. Very often governments are reluctant to invest in these systems because they think they will have to bear the full costs.

Waste Management in Anuradhapura
The waste management situation in Anuradhapura lays bear the troubles Municipal Councils across the island encounter when removing faecal sludge.
The Anuradhapura Municipal Council (AMC) is responsible for extracting and transporting the waste from 16,768 housing units as well as 3,813 business entities. This is clearly a gargantuan task, and the AMC has just two gully bowsers capable to cleaning the pit latrines and septic tanks and transporting waste.
The Councils clearance capabilities are stretched to, or beyond capacity and they respond only to emergencies.
What happens currently is that we are called by a household or a commercial enterprise when the septic tank is full and overflowing. The Municipal Council then dispatches its gully bowsers to clear the tank, said Anuradhapura Municipal Commissioner Ajantha Gunawardene.
Each of the bowsers has a capacity of 4,000 litres and residents pay Rs. 3,635 for the extraction of each load, while business entities are required to pay Rs. 4,660 per load.
According to Gunawardene, the waste is ferried to a waste treatment plant where it is converted to fertilizer for gardens and landscaping projects. But, it is unclear how only two trucks could clear and transport so much waste in such a large area.
Gunawardene acknowledged that the current method of waste extraction and transport leaves much to be desired.
We are in the process of educating people and creating a proper procedure for the collection of waste water. We want it to be more systematic and are working on how best to make it so. Also, we are looking at giving incentives to locals to encourage them to be systematic in their waste management, he said.
The AMC is investing in a faecal sludge treatment plant; a new treatment plant will open on July 1st in Anuradhapura, on BuddhagayaMawatha. It was funded by the Provincial Council and designed and constructed by the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB).
But it remains to be seen how useful a new treatment plan will be without improved waste water transportation services. As the researchers at IWMI pointed out, all aspects from emptying tanks to transport to treatment to reuse, must be developed simultaneously in order to facilitate improvements in the overall services.
You cannot treat sludge if you cannot transport it, after all.

Subscription Service
According to Balasubramanya, better waste management outcomes can be achieved by coupling public sector investment with money raised from stakeholders. She recently authored a paper in the journal PLOS ONE on her work in the Bangladeshi sub-district of Bhaluka, where she analysed the benefits of people paying small fees for an efficient and safe waste water transportation service.
The study found that splitting the cost of waste water removal through monthly payments could make the services more affordable, more efficient, and later lead to improved faecal treatment and conversion into fertilizers or energy sources.
By examining the economics of faecal sludge collection and transportation in Bhaluka, Balasubramanya found that the cost to empty a pit latrine was about $13 dollars, or about 14 percent of the average familys monthly income. Families struggle to pay such a sum for collection, even though these latrines must be emptied only once every three to four years.
But, by paying 0.31 dollars per month over the same period, about what they spend on mobile phone or cable services, families could subscribe to the faecal sludge removal and transportation service.
Though 0.31 seems a small monthly cost, the study discovered that families were willing to pay just half of it to begin with.
We found that dividing the amount families were willing to pay for waste removal, about 6.5 dollars per pick up, over twelve instalments would be easier on the households, Balasubramanya said.
Over time however, the government could increase the amounts they raise from the monthly instalments until the transportation finances itself. Furthermore, private citizens contributions can open the door for the public sector to invest in waste treatment or reuse solutions.
Co-composting, or mixing low-nutrient organic household waste with nutrient-rich faecal sludge, is a practical treatment solution. The process kills bacteria and the composted material can be used directly as fertilizer.
The compost can also be converted into fertilizer pellets, which are safe and organic substitutes for chemical fertilizers.
In Sri Lanka, there are over 110 compost stations and some of them have started co-composting.

The Sri Lankan Context
Though her research focused on rural Bangladesh, Balasubramanya thinks that her results could be replicated in Sri Lanka. The World Bank, moreover, has found that Sri Lankans are happy to pay subscription services for systems that come and collect waste.
We think there will be similar results elsewhere. Nobody wants faecal sludge in his or her backyard. Everyone is very happy to have a regular service that comes like clockwork, takes the waste away, and that you dont have to worry about. I think if you are able to demonstrate credible services for people, they are willing to pay for them.
No, they cannot pay full costs, but the whole purpose is you try to extract what you can, what is feasible, from private households who are producing this waste, and then the government covers the rest, she said.
If transportation costs are at least partially covered, it paves the way for the government to invest in treatment and reuse, which then lead to improved environmental standards and health outcomes.
From a political economy perspective, this shows that poor populations are demanding better environmental amenities and that people value clean environments. They dont want their surroundings to be polluted by waste, Balasubramanya said.

Fernando PC was leading evidence through Wasantha Alwis, who is the Additional Director of the IT Department of the Central Bank, yesterday at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue.
Fernando PC pointed out to the Commission that Alwis data analysis has mixed up the data on sales and purchases with borrowings and lending.
Fernando also suggested that data on an EPF transaction which is also included in the same analysis, contains errors. Fernando also said he will provide correct data soon to the Presidential Commission.

Excessive corn protection policy to have devastating impact on chicken prices
Excessive measure by authorities to protect corn farmers would have devastating impact on the chicken industry in Sri Lanka, warns industry specialists.
Sri Lankans rely heavy in chicken to meet their required protein needs and the increase in prices will limit to a large extent the consumption of chicken resulting in malnutrition. The annual per capita consumption of chicken in Sri Lanka, which was barely 2.5 kg a decade ago, has now reached 10.5 kg and is likely increase further in the near future. While consumption has risen more than three-fold, prices have remained virtually unchanged during this period in comparison to inflation.
The government in a bid to prevent chicken prices from increasing introduced a control price per kilo even after the control priced was removed by the government. But this situation can change quickly if authorities continue the policy to protect corn farmers and levy taxes on corn which will further increase corn prices,allege industry sources.
Furthermore, chicken producers in Sri Lanka has been able to keep chicken pricesin reasonable levels in by adoptingextremely efficient practices across their production, processing and distribution systems. They have implemented global best practices in technology and breeding, which has led to more efficient production and significant reduction in costs, which they have passed on to the consumer.
Similarly chicken producers are heavily taxed by the government and the total tax income from the chicken industry is colossal. Current corn prices are on the rise and have increased. This will have a direct impact on chicken prices resulting in price a hike per kilo. This is in the backdrop where world market prices of corn stands. The governments measures to impose a tax per kilo of corn will further jeopardize the poultry industry in SriLanka.
The repercussion of the poultry industry suffering will in turn have a very negative effect on the corn industry which will lose its market in the face of low demand for corn. Furthermore in the wake of the local poultry industry weakening the government coffers will suffer heavily losing the per kilo tax revenue and will need to import chicken which will cost the country US$ 20m per month of foreign currency.
Despite all these drawbacks chicken producers such as Crysbro have gone a step further by fully integrating their entire operations. Crysbro carries out virtually every activity that is required to produce its 'Fresh Upcountry Chicken'. From producing grains in its extensive farmlands, converting the grains into poultry feed at its feed mill plant, to raising parent birds and broilers, processing meat and packaging it  right down to delivering the chicken to supermarkets and retail outlets. In fact, Crysbro is Sri Lankas first chicken producer to achieve full vertical integration.
Yet, rising costs remain an issue that chicken producers have to constantly battle against. On top of this maintaining a corn protectionist policy by the government will further jeopardize the chicken industry in Sri Lankan leading to increase in chicken prices and putting at stake the livelihoods of thousands employed in the industry.
The excessive corn protectionist policy also may seem unusual, when one considers the fact that the poultry industry continues to make a significant contribution towards the national economy. In addition to saving millions in foreign exchange, which would otherwise be spent on importing chicken, the industry offers direct and indirect employment to hundreds of thousands of people.
Crysbro alone offers employment to thousands of people as Contract Breeders, helping their families rise above the poverty line.
In making chicken affordable to a majority of people by keeping prices low through efficient production practices, chicken producers have played a singular role in increasing the per capita consumption of animal protein, which is vital for the physical development and well-being of the population, especially the youth.It should be noted that chicken remains the most affordable source of non-plant based protein in Sri Lanka.
If the authorities are serious in maintaining the current chicken prices it is required togive relief to chicken producers, providing them with more incentives, as well as a conducive regulatory and fiscal climate could help the industry grow.
In fact, if one considers the international per capita consumption of chicken which currently stands at 17 kgs, about twice our national average.
Sri Lanka's chicken industry still has a long way to go but the corn protectionist policy and increase of corn prices will have a very negative impact on it. Sri Lankas poultry industry is one of the most efficient industries but now at the risk of facing destruction due to the incorrect shortsighted policies of the government, an industry specialist said.

## Title: FEAR not the Dark!

FEAR not the Dark!
Throughout history mankind has been plagued with many fears. Fear of humiliation, fear of the future and fear of the unknown. The unknown can take many faces. From that fear of the dark and fear of thievery are some of its faces. This fear of the dark has given rise to myths and legends and popular entertainment like X-Files. Arch World speaks to Archt. Manjula Wijeyaratne who believes good architecture can confront and defeat these fears.
People have insecurities and anxieties. Some are afraid of the dark. Some of them are afraid of thieves. These are all insecurities. When the client is afraid of the dark, we have to analyze - why are they afraid of the dark Because they cannot see beyond. So what we do is, we make our design in such a way, that there is no hidden corner or hidden area. If he can see, he does not need to be afraid. That is how architecture works.
Then there is fear of thieves - people jumping into the houses. My houses are all open houses. So I try to convince them that a professional thief will come through the front door. So it does not make a difference. Some of my clients want theft proof but you literally cant. So I tell them it does not work like that. In the houses I have done, only in one instance has there been a problem with a drug addict jumping into the house and taking the hose away. So nobody has told me that there has been an instance of thievery. So you convince the client their insecurity feeling is not as bad as they think it is, explained Wijeyaratne
Architecture deals with personalities; in fact that is the key to everything in architecture.
My ability to read my client is what I have uncovered in my practice as well as understanding the site. Reading the site is easy -such as the weather patterns and the sun-path. But reading a human being is difficult.
That is the critical part. Personalizing a three-bedroom for two different clients is the challenge. The place might be the same, but what I would design for one person may be different from what I would design for another person. The site may be the same, but the personality is different. So again it is the talent of the designer, pointed out Wijeyaratne
Colors and lines bring out the individual.
When it comes to colors and lines, I use straight, clear cut lines. I use pastel to white colors. Random feature walls come in color - those colors are strong. They are not pastel. Why I use white is, I want the personality of the client to come out. So the vibrancy of the personality should come out. The moment you use fancy colors, the background overpowers the individual. It should be the other way around. The individual should overpower the background - he should be on the pedestal. The talent of the designer is to take all of that, those essences into the design. What one person likes is not what another person likes. You have to get all of it into one design. And that is the talent of the designer. The designer creates the space. The subtle differences in each of their solutions, will be contextual and according to the different personality, informed Wijeyaratne.
The greatest lesson that he can teach a student is to build a sense of place and a sense of space.
In each project there is a relationship between the inside and the outside. There are relationships in each of those spaces. You need to make sure those relationships are enjoyable for the design to work, added Wijeyaratne.
Making a house that feels different at all times of the day, a house that a person will fall in love with and interact with depends on the talent of the designer.
The context as where the site is, matters a lot. So the sunlight, Sun-path, wind patterns, wind-path and rain pattern, all that comes into play. In addition you have to take into consideration the clients wants and personality. The clients personality is the key. Making spaces a client will fall in love with in colder climates and in the tropics we live in depends on the designer. So what the designer does for the client is not country specific. So the solutions are relative. So you create architecture which is excellent spaces, excellent light and excellent ventilation that the human enjoys and is highlighted, said Wijeyaratne
In European countries people try to get natural light as much as possible.
Natural ventilation is of course a question mark because of the seasons. So especially in the winters in colder climates they try to keep the cold out. In that aspect that cannot get natural ventilation. So, they work with what we called a control climate - a conditioned environment. So they use air conditioning or heating. Natural light, they manage to a great extent in the summers, but the flip side is, in the summers it can get too warm, stated Wijeyaratne
Timeless beauty is something subjective. What is beauty to one, may not be what is beautiful to another person.
It is again the talent of the designer. How a designer makes it timeless. It is the persons ability. Certain designer names have stood the test of time, while other designers fade away. The place and the person are very important. Then I use the appropriate materials - they may be brick, concrete or wood. I have worked with all - brick and cement walls. This is to get the right design. So it is the client and context put together, summed up Wijeyaratne.

## Title: Fighting for life & striking for SAITM

Fighting for life & striking for SAITM
Matters related to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) came to a head this week with the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) launching a continuous strike that lasted three days. The strike inconvenienced tens of thousands of patients in government hospitals which are reeling from the impact of a dengue epidemic.
The GMOA agreed to call of the strike after three days following talks with President Maithripala Sirisena. Initially, the doctors trade union said it had reached agreement with the President on key issues related to SAITM but, following the Presidential Secretariat releasing a statement regarding the talks, the GMOA was again considering its next move, saying it was not satisfied with the outcome.
Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the government announced that Cabinet had approved the takeover of the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital in Malabe, which is the main training centre for SAITM students, in the latest move by the authorities to resolve the crisis.
The SAITM crisis has been dragging on since January. Dozens of SAITM graduates, who have passed their examinations and obtained a MBBS degree, are in limbo as the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) has refused to register them and the matter is now before the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, hundreds of medical students in state medical faculties have been boycotting lectures for many months now as part of the protest campaign against SAITM.
Government ministers
A constant complaint from the government ministers who have had to deal with SAITM- mostly, Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, is that they have been lumbered with the SAITM issue because of the blunders committed by the previous government under the Mahinda Rajapaksa Presidency.
Indeed, SAITM was set up in 2008, during Rajapaksas first term as President. It is the brainchild of Dr. Neville Fernando, a doctor turned politician from Panadura. Fernando first entered Parliament in 1977, defeating Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) giant Leslie Goonewardena. However he had several differences of opinion with then President J R Jayewardene and eventually resigned when he was threatened with expulsion. Later, he was to join the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
It is no secret that SAITM had Rajapaksas blessings. Rajapaksa authorised the grant of a 600 million rupee loan for SAITM. He also facilitated the grant of scholarships to students who failed to gain entry to state medical schools by a few marks, so they could attend SAITM and obtain a medical degree. It was S B Dissanayake who, as Rajapaksas Higher Education Minister, presided over SAITM obtaining degree awarding status from the University Grants Commission (UGC), in August 2013.
To be fair by the GMOA, it had been raising concerns regarding SAITM even when Rajapaksa was President. However those were mere whimpers of protest, confined to media briefings and the occasional statement and a far cry from its current campaign of agitation. The GMOAs critics say this was because it was running scared of Rajapaksas strong arm tactics against any dissent.
It is also a fact that the GMOA endorsed and actively supported Rajapaksa during the 2015 presidential election campaign. As it did so, it did not seek any assurances from Rajapaksa regarding SAITM, even as a quid pro quo. Hence its bona fides regarding SAITM are quite questionable.
The crunch came when the SLMC refused to recognise the SAITM degree. This was in July 2015. By this time, the government had changed and Rajapaksa had been voted out of office. That was also when the GMOA stepped up its agitation against SAITM, commencing an all-out publicity campaign against the medical school and launching token strikes.
As the issue dragged on, SAITM students canvassed their grievances before the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal, in a landmark decision on January 31 this year, directed the SLMC to register the MBBS degree and in fact castigated the Council for acting beyond its purview. That is when all hell broke loose and the SAITM controversy became part of the countrys political discourse.
Anti-SAITM campaign
The medical school too does have its share of blunders. Its Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Sameera Senaratne complained that he was shot at by gunmen in early February, days after the Court of Appeal verdict. Later, Police was to declare that the shooting was staged. Senaratne was dismissed from SAITM. The incident didnt help SAITMs standing in the eyes of the public.
Since then, it has been the GMOA which has been at the forefront of the anti-SAITM campaign. However, political parties such as the Joint Opposition- which ironically set up SAITM- and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) have joined the anti-SAITM chorus. So has the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF), popularly known as the anthaery. Thus there is a coalescence of anti-government forces over this issue which is therefore no longer only about medical education: it is now a political hot potato.
The government has offered significant concessions: it has agreed to broad base the ownership of SAITM which will be listed on the stock exchange.
Fernando has agreed to hand over the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital in Malabe to the government. SAITM itself is to be managed by a board of management. The government has also agreed to publish minimum standards for medical education and has directed that SAITM students should sit a qualifying examination conducted by the SLMC.
None of this appears to have appeased the GMOA. After its talks with President Maithripala Sirisena, the GMOA took umbrage at the press release issued by the Presidential Secretariat which said that students currently holding a degree from SAITM would be accommodated and that SAITM would transform into a public-private partnership. It is demanding that SAITM be nationalised and its present students not be recognised.
The GMOAs current conduct, even if it was principled in its opposition to SAITM, has earned the wrath of the public in no uncertain terms. In the past it has been accused of staging strikes to win demands such as vehicle permits and even top schools for doctors children. Its latest actions, staging a continuous strike when the country is in the throes of a deadly dengue epidemic, is deplorable and makes a mockery of the Hippocratic Oath that its members are purported to subscribe to.
There have been other slip ups that have exposed the GMOA. Its President, Anurudhdha Padeniya, was exposed when he had listed himself on the internet for private practice on a day the doctors were on strike. Recently, it held its annual general meeting with much fanfare and jubilation, with female dancers called in for entertainment-while the continuous strike and the dengue epidemic was in full swing!
The government for its part, having compromised significantly thus far, has been determined to see SAITM established as a private medical school. This is because the state alone cannot simply meet the demand for medical education. The argument makes sense because over a thousand students travel overseas every year for private medical education. If private medical schools are established locally, it will meet that demand, save millions of rupees in foreign exchange- and the SLMC can closely monitor the conduct of these schools, much more than it can monitor overseas medical colleges.
However, the government is mindful that the SAITM crisis is now a political debate. During last weeks protests, university students stormed the Ministry of Health and damaged public property. In the ensuing melee, many students and officers of the armed forces were injured. There is concern that the anti-SAITM lobby wants to escalate its campaign, so that it would result in the death of a protestor. Then, that could be used to discredit the government further.
This happened in the late 80s, when medical student Padmasiri Thrimavithana was killed during the campaign against the North Colombo Medical College (NCMC) at Ragama. That led to the nationalisation of the NCMC. The anti-SAITM campaign is hoping for history to repeat itself.
The legal issues related to SAITM are now before the Supreme Court. When the Court delivers its final verdict, the government needs to see the issue through and do so expeditiously. To let it drag on further is to allow the controversy to fester- and the fallout can only be negative, not only for the government but also for the thousands of students both in SAITM and the state medical faculties who are now spending the best years of their lives, living in limbo and limping from one protest march to another.

First interim report to be presented in August
New Constitution:
The first interim report on the draft of a new constitution will be presented to Parliament by August this year, said the Prime Minister.
Addressing the Conference on Constitutional Reforms held at the BMICH yesterday, Chairman of the Constitutional Assembly Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe said that there is a difference between the draft constitution bill and the report on the constitution.
What we have engaged now is preparing a report on the constitution, the Premier said.
The report can be used, publicized and public opinion sought and then a debate will take place. Once the debate is over we can send a full report to Parliament and debate how the draft constitution should be prepared. It is a long process that will build the consent not divisions.
The steering committee appointed six sub committees to deal with different matters. Sub committees consulted all stakeholders and submitted the report. Now the steering committee has to submit the report. The report will be submitted by the end of August. he said.
We have accepted that the sovereignty of the people and the Parliaments right to enact legislation subject to it being approved by a referendum in certain instances which will be decided by the Supreme Court, the Premier said.
He said Parliament is responsible for enacting laws.The Constituent Assembly is a committee of the house which will sit and prepare a draft constitution.That is a stage of discussion where we are involved. The resolution itself says where we obtain the views of the public and thereafter give the power to enact a draft constitution. All the discussions take place in the Constituent Assembly.
The final authority on constitution making is the people. Somebody has complained that the public has not yet participated in the constitution drafting process.Yes that is true because the matter has not yet come to the constituent assembly. The steering committee has to determine the business of the constituent assembly and it also has to prepare a report on the constitution, he said.
We have been able to bridge the gap and reach the consensus in many issues. There are some areas which still we have different opinions. We decided that when we send the report even in some instances refer to different options.We only sending the first interim report where we have agreement in some there are agreement in principle but there are options on the principle itself. said the prime Minister.
He further added that this is different from earlier steering committee which gave first principles of constitution followed by report and the draft. So all the differences then emerged in the steering committee.When the report was debated and the sections of the report were debated in the steering committee there after the draft bill was debated.
Earlier the select committee report was submitted along with the draft and divisions and arguments took place.What we want to send to Parliament is not a report that will not divide the house. In many areas we have reached consensus. Now there is only one division where the chief ministers want more power. We all agreed that the state cannot be divided and sovereignty lies in the people.
There is no proposal to take away the foremost place of Buddhism and all religions have the freedom and that will not be subjected to pressure. Discussions were held during last two weeks between the major political parties UNP and the SLFP with regard to devolution. We will meet next week to decide the procedure and how we go ahead and how we prepare the report. There are areas still that have to be finalized.We will decide the system of election, validity of law.
Former deputy Chief Justice of South Africa Judge Moseneke, Deputy Chairman of the Constitutional Assembly Thilaga Sumathipala, Ministers, Parliamentarians,Chief Ministers of the Provincial Councils were present.

Flood Control and Water Management Data Centre in Battaramulla
Illegal settlers along water ways to be evicted:
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, who inaugurated construction work on a Flood Control and Water Management Data Centre at Battaramulla, said the new centre built with government funding will be equipped through World Bank aid.
The new centre which will be of special significance to the Disaster Management Ministry would obtain weather forecast, analysis, disaster forewarning, evolve strategies for flood control and regulation, integrated water resources, management as well as provision of environmental services and information distribution, the minister said.
It will be of special assistance to the Navy too during times of disaster management activities, he said.
Minister Ranawaka said even though certain past rulers boasted about controlling floods, they could not predict the 2010 floods which engulfed the Parliamentary complex. He said the need for a disaster warning exercise was highlighted by the experts of the Greater Colombo Flood Control Project after the 2016 floods.
Ranawake said unauthorised constructions which obstructed canal ways in Kolonnawa were dismantled recently. Steps would be taken to evict illegal settlers along water ways in Peliyagoda, Kolonnawa, and Kelaniya. It is also planned to build pumping stations along the Kelani Ganga as well as several tunnels to control floods in Colombo, he said.

Foreign expertise sought on Uma Oya project

President Maithripala Sirisena said today that advice from foreign experts will be sought to proceed with the Uma Oya project.
He said this while addressing a gathering in Nuwera-Eliya today. 
Residents in Bandarawela staged a protest yesterday against the construction of the 26 km long tunnel from Uma Oya, alleging that water levels in streams and wells in the area have dropped due to the construction and the stability of more than 7,000 houses have also been affected.
In response to these allegations, Cabinet Co-Spokesperson Minister Dhayasiri Jayasekara said that the Uma Oya project was started without following proper criteria by the previous regime.
Furthermore he said that Sri Lanka has taken a large volume of loans from Iran for this project.
He said that the government cannot give up on this project even though it is problematic to continue with it.
Jayasekara also pointed out the adverse environmental conditions have arised mainly due to the machines employed for the project.
However a Ministerial subcommittee comprising of Ministers Mahinda Amaraweera, Patali Champika Ranawaka and Vijit Vijayamuni Zoysa was appointed yesterday to look into the issues raised from the Uma Oya project.

All Sri Lankan girls aged above 10 will be vaccinated against the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Health Ministry spokesman said.
 According to the spokesman, the vaccine will be included in the National Immunization Programme from July 3 this year and it will be injected to all school girls starting from grade six.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne decided to include the vaccine in the programme with the intention of eradicating cervical cancer from Sri Lanka.
There are only two ways of preventing cervical caner. The first and successful method is obtaining the vaccine againstHuman Papilloma Virus (HPV) and the second method is subjecting to cancer screening (PAP Smear Test) regularly.
Meanwhile MBBS, MD, Dip. RT, Consultant in Clinical Oncology and Radiotherapy Dr.Mahendra Perera said thatthe vaccine will prevent more than 85 percent of Cervical Cancer in women.
He said that cervix cancer is the 2nd common cancer in females in Sri Lanka and it is mostly detected at Stage 3 which is a very advanced stage and which is not completely curable.
Once detected in early stages, it is curable either by surgery or Chemo-Radiotherapy Dr.Mahendra Perera added.

Global cyber attack hits businesses globally
A massive ransomware attack has hit businesses around the world, causing major companies to shut down their computer systems.
Researchers are still investigating the software behind the attack, warning that its more sophisticated than the WannaCry worm that struck hundreds of thousands of computers across the globe last month.
WannaCry was a tremendous failure. It was a lot of noise, very little money, and everyone noticed it, said Craig Williams, an expert at cybersecurity firm Cisco Talos. What were seeing today is a much more intelligent worm.
Big global brands like Mondelez (MDLZ), the maker of Oreos, and British advertising giant WPP (WPPGF) say their IT systems are experiencing problems.
The ransomware infects computers and locks down their hard drives. It demands a $300 ransom in the anonymous digital currency Bitcoin.
The email account associated with the ransomware has been blocked, so even if victims pay, they wont get their files back.
Law enforcement and cybersecurity experts agree that victims should never pay ransoms for such attacks. (CNN)

'Huge potential for SL to become IT leader in South East Asia'
There is very good potential for Sri Lanka to become a leader in South East Asia in IT adoption, said Assistant General Counsel and Regional Director, Digital Crimes Unit (DCU), Microsoft Asia, Keshav Dhakad, at a press briefing in Singapore recently.
The initiative that we have seen in the private sector, banking industry and the government of Sri Lanka is that there is a huge potential not only to grow the market in terms of bringing new technology as an enabler to connect citizens but also how to grow Sri Lankan businesses to become regional businesses and how to become a regional player and not just focus on the country itself, he said. We have invested in Sri Lanka in terms of technology adoption, innovation, empowerment and invested in working on philanthropy, building education and technology, bringing technology for social upliftment by connectivity and accessibility to technology. Asia will be the next powerhouse for managing the growth of the world economy and Asia will be the key for future global economy, he said.
We have already seen some very good signs in terms of how Sri Lankan companies are adopting cloud. They are becoming more open about cloud because they want to expand and they want to use technology which is fast, reliable and cheaper to manage. But they are looking at security very seriously, he said.
We have met entrepreneurs, customers and government officials in Sri Lanka and we can see very clearly that there is an open-minded society in Sri Lanka. We can see the technology is empowering.
This cannot only empower enterprises and businesses but also it can make government more transparent, more accessible and it can be more accountable to people, he said.
Overall we can see that majority of Sri Lankan youth using mobile phones and internet and this can be the game changer.
The younger population, the more they get trained in IT, the more they understand IT and appreciate how IT can be transformative to their personal lives, for their interest and good jobs they are seeking.
There is a big potential for the work population to become more employable, to find more opportunities by adopting good IT practices, he said. Sri Lanka has to be more careful when it comes to cybersecurity and Sri Lanka is also targeted like other countries because it is a growing market. There is a huge potential, we see a lot of awareness is going on and adoption of disruptive technologies. Even the government is looking at regulations which can help companies to expand businesses using cloud technologies, he said.
We would like to see how this can support to develop local talent which can then become entrepreneurs, so that they can become leaders, as they stay in Sri Lanka or they go out of the country, he added.

Kantalas dynamic entrepreneurs promote 300-year-old hana weaving
Two young designers, Vikum Rajapakse and Nadishan Shanthikumar, have a launched major crusade to take traditional handwoven mats kantala to the international market. To meet this objective they have floated Kantala (Private) Limited.
Kantala is an ethical fashion accessory brand inspired by a 300-year-old traditional handweaving technique, indigenous to a tiny hamlet in Sri Lankas hill country.
Co-founders Rajapakse and Shanthikumar studying in England, always felt Sri Lanka had more to offer than being just a manufacturing destination for global fashion brands.
During his travels, Rajapakse was inspired by how Egypt's rich culture and crafts were integrated into contemporary goods.
Inspired by his discovery, he returned determined to carry Sri Lanka's wonderful traditional crafts to the global market through contemporary products and help traditional artisans secure a sustainable livelihood.
Rajapakse and Shanthikumar harboured ambitions of one day founding their very own venture. Starting off as colleagues, they quickly struck a chord, building a friendship based on shared values, aspirations and, not the least, a passion for the same football team and fast cars.
During their individual searches for the perfect idea they were inspired to join forces and bring their vision for Kantala to life.
While searching for the right traditional craft to take beyond Sri Lanka, Rajapakse was directed to a village of artisans outside of Kandy by a family friend. Upon visiting the village, he came across the community of artisans and their traditional handwoven mats.
After a chat with villagers, he knew straight away the search was over and with M. Dharmadasa he has met an artisan who shared his vision for the traditional handwoven mats.
Rajapakse shared his findings with Shanthikumar, explaining to him details of the handwoven mat, the history behind it and what he has in mind. Shanthikumar agreed that the handwoven mat has immense potential and was ready to partner Rajapakse to create a venture that will support the livelihoods of the traditional artisans.
"The traditional artisans are at the centre of everything Kantala does, providing them a sustainable livelihood and helping to protect one of Sri Lankas beautiful handcrafts for the future," said Rajapakse.
The handwoven hana mat is the centrepiece of every Kantala product. It is a craft perfected and passed down the generations for over 300 years in the village of Henavala in Kandy area.
It is woven with precision, passion and pride by the master artisans residing in the village. To this day they retain the simple and eco-friendly process introduced by their ancestors,  said Rajapakse.
Today, 95 families reside in Henavala and owing to economic reasons around 10 families actively engage in the craft and the younger folk continue to venture beyond the village in search of more lucrative and modern jobs.
"Through the popularisation of the handwoven hana mat through Kantala, we endeavour to provide the artisans of Henavala a respectable livelihood and encourage a new generation to continue the tradition," said Shanthikumar.
While at their full-time jobs, Rajapakse and Shanthikumar set about laying the foundation for their venture, frequently visiting the village of Henavala, trailing different mats, handbag designs and researching the market.
Given their background in the world of investment and finance, they had a lot to learn and sought advice from people already in the sector.
Little under two years from having first conceived the idea, they resigned from their day jobs and took the plunge to operate Kantala full time. 
'Kantala' / knt<U+01DD>la: / is named after the Sanskrit word for the hana plant, which yields the core material used to create all their products. The leaves are scraped to extract a fine fibre, which is used to weave the mats used in their products. The fibre extracted from the hana plant is dyed using either natural plant colour or reactive dyes, conforming to stringent ecological standards.
At Kantala we make fashion accessories that reflect and enhance the taste and personality of our customers. Tasteful and functional designs that retain the splendour of the handwoven Hana mats are the essence of Kantala products.
From the cheerful and reliable everyday handbag to the glamorous and delicate masterpiece, there is a Kantala product for every mood and occasion, said Shanthikumar.
With everything in place we have now started the campaign that will be Kantalas launch pad for international expansion. The profits raised from the campaign will be utilised to support Kantalas international expansion, the purchase of a hana fibre cleaning machine and setting up of a weavers cooperative for the artisans, Rajapakse said. They hope the crowdfunding campaign will achieve their US$ 40,000 fixed funding target.
Kantala will be offering its first range of products to combine the new Piatex material with the core material of all Kantala products, the hana mat.
At Kantala we ensure no animals are harmed during the process of making our products. No animal based material is used to make a Kantala retail product. Kantala is a PETA approved Vegan brand," the duo said. Co-founder and Managing Director, Rajapakse wears multiple hats working at Kantala. While his main function is to set the strategic direction of the brand and the environment and resources for the rest of the eco-system to operate, he also manages the supply chain of the brand.
He completed his higher education in the UK, completing a bachelors in business and economics. He worked for a year in London in asset management. Upon returning to Sri Lanka he worked with the countrys largest apparel exporter for three years. Kantala is his third entrepreneurial venture, having tried his hand in a cinnamon export venture and HR software solution before.
Co-founder and CMO, Shanthikumar is in charge of all the sales and marketing functions at Kantala. From setting the annual marketing plans to executing them on social media or meeting customers and clients, he is Kantalas salesman. He spends hours behind the lens perfecting each and every social media post.
Shanthikumar too completed his higher education in the UK, completing his masters in financial mathematics. He counts two years of professional experience in the UK having worked with a couple of investment banks and funds. In Sri Lanka, he also worked with the countrys largest apparel exporter for two years, joining the same team as Rajapakse. Kantala is Nadishans first startup venture.
Kantala has also received the 2016 award for 'Sustainable Sourcing' from the Good Market, Sri Lanka for the use of sustainable materials, OEKO Tex and ISO-certified dyes and natural dyes.More information could be obtained from

Lady lawyer awarded nearly Rs 1 mn in landmark labour case
A.S.Damayanthi, Attorney-at-Law and ex-legal officer of one of the leading listed companies based in Nawinna, filed an action in the Labour Tribunal, Pannipitiya, against her former company in a labour law suit.
Attorney-at-Law A.S.Damayanthi filed an action against the respondent company for wrongful termination of employment and obtained an order from the tribunal which determined that her termination has been wrongful and was awarded sum of Rs 900,000 after having worked at the said comapny for four-and-a-half years.
It was revealed in the judgment that the question that had to be determined by the tribunal was whether the applicant was wrongfully terminated due to attending some notarial work outside the scope of her employment.
Ian Fernando, Senior Counsel with Sumudu Rathnayake appeared for the applicant, A.S. Damayanthi. The company was represented by Indra Laduhetti, Senior Counsel. The Learned Labour Tribunal President, in his 33-page judgment, set out as follows: He quoted the judgment that was set out in the case of Adams vs. Derby City Council (1986)1 ILR at page 63 which said 'If the employer cant prove any reason for the dismissal, the dismissal is automatically unfair'.
In the said case, the applicant, attorney-at law A.S.Damayanthi had been charge-sheeted at the domestic inquiry wherein she was held guilty of not attending a Board meeting and for having executed certain notarial documents not belonging to the respondent company.
It was stated in the applicants letter of appointment that no other legal work can be undertaken which directly or indirectly will affect the respondent company during her contract of employment.
Although she was found guilty at the domestic inquiry, Learned President of the Labour Tribunal having given his mind to the domestic inquiry order and held that the applicant A.S Damayanthi had been wrongful terminated.
The termination was admitted by the respondent company and therefore the said company including the chief legal officer Jayalatha Sriweera with five other witnesses gave evidence in favour of the company stating that the termination of the applicant was justifiable.
lan Fernando, counsel for the applicant, vociferously cross-examined the chief legal officer who was questioned whether certain other lawyers in the said organization had done notarial work during their tenure of office and documents such as deeds and land registry extracts were obtained to show same. These lawyers had done notarial work outside the scope of employment which did not hinder the progress of the respondent company.
The Learned President of the Labour Tribunal observed that the contract of employment signed by the applicant and the respondent company has been termed as an unilateral agreement in favour of the respondent company. He said the said agreement was one-sided.
It was also observed that certain restraining clauses of employment can be put on a letter of appointment solely when the commercial objective of the respondent company and its trade secrets are at stake.
However if the applicant employee had during his spare time indulged in work which does not hamper seriously or damage primarily the employers' business, it will not be termed that the employee is guilty of breaking the conditions set out in employment stated in her letter of employment.
It was also observed by the tribunal's president that Samanthika Gallage, attorney-at-law who worked for the respondent company also had done notarial practice during her employment.
Therefore in consequence of Article 14 (01) G (read with Article 12), every person needs to be treated equally as set out in the Constitution in Sri Lanka Articles 4(d), 17, 126 and 3rd chapter Articles from 10 to 17 show administrative actions if violated, the Supreme Court has a right to entertain such application and take into account the decision by the learned president of labour tribunal who has observed that the applicant has the right to do her notarial practice which would not hamper the company directly or indirectly.
Therefore the application made by the lawyer in the labour tribunal for wrongful dismissal from employment was substantiated and she succeeded in her application that the termination was wrongful.

Lankan Women up against Australia at Bristol today
ICC Womens World Cup:
Australia launched its title defense with a convincing win over the West Indies in Taunton on Monday and captain Meg Lanning is keen to build on that against Sri Lanka in Bristol on Thursday.
Australia batter Nicole Bolton was the star of the show with a fluent unbeaten 107, helping her side to an eight-wicket victory. Ellyse Perry also took three wickets as West Indies was bowled out for 204 and Australia will hope to replicate that near-perfect performance when it takes on Sri Lanka in its second match of the tournament.
But Lanning is not underestimating the challenge posed by Sri Lanka, despite the nine-wicket defeat by New Zealand in its opening game in Bristol on the opening day of the tournament.
Lanning said: They definitely provide a good challenge for us, they bowled a lot of spin when we were out there in Sri Lanka itself and it will be interesting to see whether they do the same this time around.
We know theyve got some players in their team who are dangerous, were keen to keep playing well so its important that we start well again and put lots of pressure on them.
We feel like if were the ones in control and we can get the result that we want.
"It's going to be difficult to change a winning side but we'll have to look at the conditions and the opposition as well and pick the best team that we can.
"Our spinners have been very successful over the past couple of years. We're not too fussed about playing an extra spinner over a seamer but we are going to pick the team on the conditions and the opposition and what we think's going to work better.
"It could change, it could stay the same. The good thing is our squad has got such great depth that we could bring anyone in and they'd play a role.
Sri Lanka captain Inoka Ranaweera accepts her side was disappointing in the defeat by New Zealand and will need to improve in all departments if it is to get a result against Australia.
Chamari Atapattu scored 53 against the White Ferns as Sri Lanka was bowled out for 188 and then only managed to take one wicket in reply when Chandima Gunaratne trapped Rachel Priest in front of the wickets.
And in Bristol, the skipper is hoping the team gives a far better account of itself.
Ranaweera said: Well need to improve everything and play really well against Australia. That will be a very hard game for us as they are a great side.
We hope to do our best against them and put in a good performance. We were very disappointed with our performance on Saturday. The New Zealand team played very well, but we were not at our best unfortunately all the way through the game.
Squads (to be selected from):
Australia: Meg Lanning (captain), Sarah Aley, Kristen Beams, Alex Blackwell, Nicole Bolton, Ashleigh Gardner, Rachael Haynes, Alyssa Healy, Jess Jonassen, Beth Mooney, Ellyse Perry, Megan Schutt, Belinda Vakarewa, Elyse Villani and Amanda-Jade Wellington
Sri Lanka: Inoka Ranaweera (captain), Chamari Atapattu, Chandima Gunaratne, Nipuni Hansika, Ama Kanchana, Eshani Lokusooriya, Harshitha Madhavi, Dilani Manodara, Hasini Perera, Chamari Polgampala, Udeshika Prabodani, Oshadhi Ranasinghe, Shashikala Siriwardena, Prasadani Weerakodi and Sripali Weerakkody

Last conversation with a beautiful mind
My last conversation with Dr Saman Kelegama was about Oxford. It was a place that he was so fond of, and he always remembered his Oxford days with gratitude. He read Industrial Economics for his doctorate at St Catherines College. He was a St Cats man. Some of us Reuter Fellows, the first reporters to be sent to Oxford in the late 1980s got to know him at St Giles, where we were housed at Queen Elizabeth House.
The press was focused on Sri Lanka at that time, though the Sri Lanka fraternity was tiny as always. The Indian army had been asked to leave by the Sri Lanka government under siege by the JVP Marxist rebels. Kelegamas views were of interest to us. He was a Sri Lankan who had studied Mathematics in India and was seen as someone who had insight into the psyche of both countries.
Our last conversation was at the Institute of Policy Studies in Colombo, a few days before he left for Bangkok from where he was never to return. It was also about the matter of utmost importance concerning India that had been entrusted to him by the state. He was undoubtedly the best man for the job, of taking the current India-Sri Lanka free trade agreement to the next level for better market access to the Indian markets.
His loss is immense to this country after the work he has done and left unfinished, at a time when India is Sri Lankas largest trading partner. Overall bilateral trade between the two countries exceeds over $ 4.5 billion. India is the largest source of imports to Sri Lanka and the third largest destination for Sri Lankan exports. It is among the first five largest investors in Sri Lanka and the bulk of Sri Lankan foreign direct investment overseas is located in India.
Postwar Sri Lanka
Saman was a man who understood its importance only too well. I realised during that last conversation how well he had grasped his entrusted task, in the context of the great leap forward that Sri Lanka was poised within the global economy, with the inevitable rise of Asia. He knew that there was nothing to stop us now, as postwar Sri Lanka was yearning for greatness. He knew the correct approach to India in the backdrop of the Sri Lanka government making tactical overtures towards China and India since 2015. Strategically located Sri Lanka had sought to craft its policies in the region to gain the goodwill and the funds from both Asian giants when China has emerged as Sri Lankas leading source of official development assistance and foreign direct investment with a total outlay of $14.75 billion.
The personal loss to all of us who knew this gentle human being can never be described. His exemplary family life and the lives of thousands of people he touched by making their lives better, as head of Singer & Co cannot be quantified.
The life and work of Saman Kelegama have to be appreciated not only because of his expertise in Industrial Economics. His entrusted work as a leading technocrat has to be valued in the context of his overview of regional politics; he had developed from his Oxford days. He sought to understand life and politics outside the realm of applied economics and policy formulation. That is what made conversation with him a rewarding experience. He too believed as it has been famously said, that we too have tried to change our country more often than we change our shoes, and was idealistic enough to believe that history which usually changes slowly, can sometimes change during a conversation.
Oxford days of the tiny Sri Lanka fraternity in the late 1980s saw the dominant figures of Richard Gombrich, a foremost authority on Buddhism who had written on Sinhalese Buddhism in relation to the Pali Canon. He was working with Anuradha Seneviratna, a postdoctoral Sinhala professor from Peradeniya on Kandyan temple paintings. They were instrumental in bringing Sarachchandra and the Maname players, for a performance at Oxford.
LTTE apologists
All this was happening as Sri Lanka was falling apart under the second JVP rebellion and the British press was reporting it extensively. While the LTTE apologists were active in influencing the Oxford academia, at The Oxford Majlis Asian Society (1896), the second oldest student society at Oxford after the Oxford Union which was Indian dominated in the late 1980s, there was Indian hostility towards Sri Lanka, after the Premadasa government had asked the Indian Army to withdraw.
These events undoubtedly influenced Saman in his formative years at Oxford. He found his conversation with journalism fellows equally rewarding.
We were tutored by Neville Maxwell a former London Times foreign correspondent to China, India and Ceylon, who had authored Indias China War based on top-secret Indian military reports. Our regular haunts at St Giles were the famous pubs, The Eagle & the Child and The Lamb & the Flag. Beyond serious conversation on China, India and Sri Lanka we were fond of discussing the senior Indian civil servants who were also at Queen Elizabeth House, and it was said they were being re-educated by MI5 which brainwashed the future of Asia.
The conversational spirit of Oxford was very much alive in Kelegama when those were the days we thought would never end. That never left him and perhaps gave him inspiration from within, as much as the many he inspired. Since his return to Sri Lanka and his dedicated work on the island for over twenty-five years, he never sought greener pasture overseas.
In my official dealings with him on behalf of a foreign government, it was a pleasure to observe how he used the resources offered to institutions under him to develop young underprivileged educated Sri Lankans without overseas exposure, to gain that experience in the US. He did it with the dedication of a man who was conscious of its immense benefit to nation building. You will be missed. We will remember you.

## Title: MAHANAMA succeeded against the odds

MAHANAMA succeeded against the odds
The distinguishing character of an outstanding cricketer is not only his ability to play well but also to be able to deal with pressure. And often it could be political pressure of sorts or petty bickering that demoralizes one. We had a situation where a cricketer was pushed from pillar to post, shunted in all positions in the batting order, even facing threats to be dropped from the team.
Yet he showed the true sportsman in him, and ducked all bouncers and even underarm deliveries. He surely stood tall unafraid and unbowed, because for him the game was the thing. And the player who rode those beds of nails was ROSHAN SIRIWARDENE MAHANAMA.
As a batsman and fielder and leader by example, he was world class. His problem was that to him a spade was a spade and not any other implement. He stood up against what was wrong, cringing was not in his book and whoever powerful was the opponent did not matter to him. He stood ramrod straight. How we wish there were men of his stature and calibre.
The powers that be of that time, did not like the straight talking and refusing to be a yes sir man. He would, if the need arose, knock his head against the dumb heads who were the cricketing rocks at that time and who were revengeful unable to get him to genuflect before them.
Career began to blossom
As his career began to blossom and his form and class being permanent, attempts to drop him failed miserably and the cruel attempt they made was to shunt him from opener, to all other batting positions in the team. But with a smile he would offer a straight bat and score the runs that were important, and finally it was his critics who wriggled like worms and shamelessly acknowledged his indispensability.
MAHANAMA shone from his early days at Nalanda College as a watchful and attacking opening batsman with dash, style and classic technique and a brilliant fielder in the covers second to none in world cricket.
When he made his Test debut for the country against Pakistan in 1986, watching that game and covering that Test which was played at the Colombo Cricket Ground and I was covering that game for the 'Daily Mirror and Times of Ceylon, if my memory serves me right, I was in the company of former Royal College all rounder Lalith Senanayake and brother of opening batsman Nanda Senanayake taking in the action. Both brothers were opponents of the writer in school cricket.
World class fielder
Lalith who had the knack of spotting an extraordinary, captain, batsman, bowler or fielder was after watching MAHANAMAs mannerism on the field hovering around in the covers, promptly told me that MAHANAMA would be a world class fielder as his career unwinds. And how prophetic Lalith was.
MAHANAMA strode the field like a colossus especially marshaling the cover and point areas. No ball would pass him or would he rarely miss a catch. He had a safe pair of hands and was always on his toes, watchful and nicely positioned to either dive both ways, jump high or dive forward to gobble a lofted shot from the batsman. With MAHANAMA in the covers rarely did batsman attempt to cut or slash. Such was the fear and respect they had for him. How Sri Lanka must be yearning for catchers of his class.
Like Sanath Jayasuriya had a liking to hit sixes to quench his thirst and while bowlers suffered the ignominy of watching the balls sail over the line. MAHANAMA had the god given prowess of taking catches that were breathtaking. In addition to gobbling up catches, he saved hundreds of runs for his team and country. Believe it or not in all formats of the game from Test cricket, to one-day cricket, to First class he pocketed a total of 421 catches - The breakdown  TESTS 56 - ONE DAYERS 109 - FIRST CLASS 136  A GAMES 120. A proud record to caw about.
On catches and the cliche that 'catches win matches', when I met former great Australian captain and leg spinning all rounder Richie Benaud in Australia, he told me that a dropped catch may not necessarily mean losing, but it can make winning that much more difficult.
Consistent scores
MAHANAMA was made to open batting. That was how he was taught the game at Nalanda College. He continued that way playing for Bloomfield Cricket Club and Colombo Cricket Club. He walked into the national team after his consistent and telling scores in that position. Once he sported national colours it was not a bed of roses for him. His outspokenness that was an example and hall mark in his life led him to trouble against a dictator of that time who was calling the tune. They were trying to keep him out batting him in all possible positions, but undeterred he faced it all and finally emerged the winner bowling out his detractors.
MAHANAMA whose concentration was unwavering and technique an example was associated in massive stand of 576 runs for the second wicket with his good friend and dashing opener Sanath Jayasuriya with MAHANAMA making 225 and Jayasuriya 340 against India at the R.Premadada Stadium in 1997 which took Sri Lanka to the best Test total of 952 beating the record of 903 held by England.
It came as a surprise when after the disaster of the 1996 World Cup he was made one of the fall guys and was dropped with the selectors of that era saying that he was being left out in an endeavor to groom youngsters. He had a lot more cricket ahead of him and his dropping will go down as one of the injustices of Sri Lanka cricket. MAHANAMA in a no punches pulled autobiography titled RETIRED HURT by famous Australian cricket writer Ken Piesse told it all.
Exalted company
After being forced to quit the game he loved best and played with great respect and dignity, he joined the exalted company of the that great batsman/captain RANJAN MADUGALLE who is a monument to Sri Lanka cricket as a match referee and quit that post too having done the job to the best of his ability and the satisfaction of his superiors and all cricketers and teams.
MAHANMA made his test debut vs Pakistan at the Colombo Cricket Club Ground on March 4, 1986. He played his last Test vs South Africa at the Super Sport Park on March 27, 1998. He made his ODI debut vs Pakistan at Asgiriya Stadium on March 2, 1986 ad played his last ODI vs Kenya at the County Ground on May 30, 1999. He was one of the props in the 1995/96 Sri Lanka World Cup winning team.
MAHANAMAS batting records  TESTS 52  RUNS 2576  HIGHEST 225  CENTURIES 4  FIFTIES 11. ODIs 213  RUNS 5162  HIGHEST 119 not out  CENTURIES 4  FIFTIES 35. FIRST CLASS 137  RUNS 6698  HIGHEST 225  HUNDREDS 12  FIFTIES 31. LIST A MATCHES  250  RUNS 6374 - HIGHEST 119 no  CENTURIES 6  FIFTIES 41.

Modi jets into Netherlands, Indias gateway to Europe
INDIA: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi jetted into The Netherlands for a one-day working visit on Tuesday to boost ties between the major trading partners.
Some 20 percent of India's exports to Europe flows through The Netherlands and both leaders said the lowlands country is seen as a "major gateway" to the continent.
"As far as bilateral investments are concerned, until now The Netherlands stands as the fifth-largest source of foreign direct investment," Modi said after meeting Rutte at his official residence in The Hague.
"I don't think there is any need to repeat the fact that in India's economic development and our priorities for development, Netherlands is a natural partner," Modi added.
The Netherlands in particular specialises in water management and the two countries Tuesday signed an agreement which includes cooperation in managing India's numerous river deltas as well as anti-pollution measures in the Ganges River. New Delhi and The Hague also signed a memorandum of understanding on social security agreements and cultural cooperation.
Rutte "commended India for its commitments to renewable energy and to the Paris Climate Agreement" and threw his support behind India's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.
"The role of The Netherlands as India's gateway to Europe is only expected to grow in the coming years," Rutte said. India remains a major trading partner of The Netherlands, with exports to the subcontinent totalling some 2.9 billion euros ($3.2 billion) last year, according to the Dutch central statistics office.
Modi's visit followed his trip to the United States where he and President Donald Trump both pledged to boost their quest for economic growth to strengthen the world's two largest democracies.- AFP

Money talks
Sri Lankas Government expenditure for 2017 will be around Rs 1,819 bn, nearly 18.8% of GDP. Taxes were increased steeply in the last budget to help pay for this expenditure.
Is this money being properly spent Is the public receiving value for its money How do we ensure that the money spent delivers benefits How do we hold the Government accountable
When a person is given the responsibility to hold, use or dispose of resources not belonging to him, he must be held fully answerable to the owner of the resources for what he does with them. This, in essence, is the principle of accountability. The Government is spending public money. We need to know if it is properly spent.
In the Westminster tradition, Sri Lanka has a Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) to scrutinise spending. Unfortunately, for multiple reasons, as currently structured it is weak.
The COPA is responsible for overseeing government expenditures, and to ensure they are effective and honest. The committee is seen as a crucial mechanism for ensuring transparency and accountability in government financial operations, having been described by Professor Peter Hennessy specialist in the history of government as "the queen of the select committees...[which] by its very existence exert[s] a cleansing effect in all government departments.
As it is a key part of our accountability arrangements to safeguard public money some suggestions to strengthen its functions follow.
The suggestions may appear to be radical, but the holders of office should understand that they must act solely in the public interest and should be willing to submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate to their office.
COPAs independence
The COPA must always be chaired by a member of the opposition. In Sri Lanka, It is currently chaired by a government MP, who also holds a Cabinet post, a double disqualification which raises serious questions about the COPAs independence.
As a standard of good practice as well as by tradition, the COPA must be chaired by a member of the Opposition to promote independent scrutiny. For the same reason, Cabinet Ministers who form a part of Executive should not be appointed to the COPA, much less chair it.
Given the surfeit of Ministers there may be practical difficulties in finding ordinary MPs to appoint to the committee, but even if Ministers are appointed they should be expected to recuse themselves from meetings when matters under their purview are examined, a protocol that the Chair should strictly enforce.
It is also reported that attendance at COPA meetings is poor due to a large number of committees that MPs must attend.
A COPA whose independence is already compromised and whose meetings are poorly attended is unlikely to be an effective check on the executive.
A solution to both issues would be to appoint non-parliamentarians to the COPA. This is not without precedent and given the importance of the committee something that should be considered seriously.
Committee hearings
Given that the work of the committee is of a technical nature it is important that people with the necessary skills are appointed. It is suggested that the main accountancy bodies; the ICASL, CIMA, ACCA, AAT and the Chartered Financial Analysts be invited to recommend a member each to be appointed to the COPA.
The presence of non-parliamentarians would strengthen the independence of the COPA. Having a number of technically competent people to review finances would greatly enhance the degree of scrutiny possible.
To enhance this still further the COPA meetings should be open to the media and the public. In the UK even tourists are welcome to attend committee hearings.
The media have a crucial role in reporting the work of the COPA to the public. Media scrutiny and the public interest will make the Executive more alert and likely to respond positively to COPA recommendations in a timely manner.
The typical financial audit looks at the accuracy of the records; whether revenues have been collected and properly accounted for, expenditure has been incurred in accordance with the wishes of Parliament and that accounting for financial transactions is accurate, complete and in compliance with the relevant laws and financial rules.
The COPA and the Auditor General now need to expand this scope and scrutinise the value for moneythe economy, efficiency and effectivenessof public spending.
Three criteria are to assess the value for money of government spending i.e. the optimal use of resources to achieve the intended outcomes.
1. Economy: minimising the cost of resources used or required (inputs)  spending less.
2. Efficiency: the relationship between the output of goods or services and the resources to produce them  spending well.
3. Effectiveness: the relationship between the intended and actual results of public spending (outcomes)  spending wisely.
Public institutions may have spent money as approved by the Parliament and recorded the expenses correctly but have they achieved the purpose for which the money was allocated If the purpose was achieved, was it done in the most efficient manner possible
At a time when the public is suffering under a high burden of the tax, maintaining the level of public services, while at the same time freezing, or even reducing total public spending should be the goal. It sounds contrarian but is possible if the Government re-thinks the way in which public services are delivered.
There will, and should be, tussles in this committee but as the UK government admitted  the Committee has thus helped the Government to secure financial savings, raise the standards of public services and improve the quality of delivery.
Shouldnt we expect the same

Monk, three others complain to SC against Attorney-at-Law
Four people including three Buddhist monks yesterday, filed four complaints in the Supreme Court urging that necessary legal action be taken against Attorney-at-Law Lakshan Dias for allegedly making a false statement to the media.
These complaints had been filed by four people, including Ven. Hobariyawe Rathanasara Thera of the Kandaketiya Sri Dhammarama Viharaya.
Filing the four affidavits before the Chief Justice, the petitioners stated that Attorney-at-Law Lakshan Dias had claimed during a television programme telecast on June 14, that there were 195 attacks against Christian places of worship from January 8, 2015 until to date.
They alleged that Lakshan Dias asserted that some Buddhist monks were responsible for these attacks. The complainants further informed that Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith had also went on to say that he was not aware of many such attacks on Christian places of worship.
The complainants alleged that Attorney-at-Law Lakshan Dias was attempting to incite racial or religious hatred among communities in the country.

Over 130 fever patients admitted to national hospital daily
Seventy one with dengue hemorrhagic fever:
About 356 dengue patients are receiving treatment at the Colombo National Hospital. Seventy one patients are with dengue hemorrhagic fever, Director Dr. Anil Jasinghe said.
According to Dr. Jasinghe, between 135 and 150 fever patients get admitted to the hospital daily. Dengue patients receive treatment in 15 wards. They were provided with 25 folding beds. Another 25 folding beds will be provided to more dengue patients, he said.
Jasinghe said there is a decrease in hospital admissions for other diseases because patients try to avoid hospital admission due to the high number of dengue patients at the hospital. Hospital admission of dengue patients has been minimised because of limited facilities to obtain blood reports within 30 minutes. Patients get admitted to the hospital after considering their blood count and clinical status, he said.
He said the capacity of the hospital was increased to accommodate more dengue patients and allocate a cubicle with eight beds for every ward for dengue patients. A nurse with specialised training manages the cubicle, he said.
Two beds from each cubicle function as High Dependency Unit with facilities for monitoring and managing serious patients, Jasinghe said.

Over 130 senior public servants get CPFA qualification
Over 130 senior public servants were recently conferred with the Chartered Public Finance Accountancy (CPFA) qualification at the inaugural CPFA Convocation organised by the CA Sri Lanka Public Sector Wing, the Association of Public Finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APFASL), in an effort to strengthen the country's public financial management.
The qualification was granted to 132 public servants who were accountants, auditors and commissioners of the Inland Revenue Department based on merit and who had fulfilled the necessary criteria including a minimum of 10 years' service in an executive grade as accountants, auditors and commissioners with a MBA or higher degree in a finance-related subject and were above the age of 40.
The convocation was held under the patronage of Minister for Special Assignments Dr. Sarath Amunugama, the chief guest, and State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne, the guest of honour.
CPFA is an internationally recognised groundbreaking qualification specially developed by APFASL and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) London, for the benefit of accountants, auditors and assessors in the Sri Lankan public sector to help them enhance their professional skills, to strengthen the financial management within the sector, which in turn will reflect positively on the country and its economic development.
President of CA Sri Lanka, Lasantha Wickremasinghe speaking at the convocation said that accounting professionals contribute vastly towards the economic growth of a country and the public financial management is a key ingredient for economic development in Sri Lanka.
Highly educated professionals with the required skills and expertise in promoting good governance, transparency and accountability is the need of the hour, and this is specially important for a country such as Sri Lanka. I am certain that the 132 members who will receive the CPFA qualification today based on merit, will pave the way to enhance the country's public finance management, and will give leadership towards achieving this goal, he said.
APFASL President V. Kanagasabapathy highlighted that professional organisations have an important role to play in strengthening the professional capacity of the public sector, and having understood this responsibility.
CA Sri Lanka together with the APFASL has taken steps to help professionalize the public financial management personnel in Sri Lanka by launching the CPFA qualification, among several other important initiatives, he said.
He said that the association decided to confer the qualification on merit on the 132 public servants as the examination process will take time to produce fully qualified chartered public finance accountants.
Considering the fact that this process will take few years to have fully qualified chartered public finance accountants, as an initial step we decided to offer the membership to around 132 senior public servants who have been selected purely on merit basis in order to create a nucleus of members to start with and to take our activities to the rest of the members, he said.
Kanagasabapathy also extended his appreciation to the Asian Development Bank for supporting APFASL's initiatives to strengthen the financial management in the public sector.

Passion, Poise and panache!
She is certainly going places. Incoming UN Youth Envoy Jayathma Wickramanayake will taking office as the second Youth Envoy in the history of the United Nations System next month. She will be succeeding Ahmad Alhendawi of Jordan.
Jayathma has the panache for youth related work. She has many years of experience working with high-level UN initiatives on youth and sustainable development. She also played a key role in transforming the youth development sector in Sri Lanka. A co founder of Hashtag Generation Jayathma has been spearheading projects which encourage youth to take part in political and civic activities. Her experience of working with grassroots youth organizations and political parties, initiating projects aimed at youth development together with her high-level experience in representing the youth agenda, globally, won her the role as the UN Secretary-Generals Envoy on Youth.
Jayathma WickramanayakePictures by Saman Sri Wedage
From becoming the first ever UN Youth Delegate to the negotiator of the UN Resolution that declared the World Youth Skills Day and now as the newly appointed UN Envoy on Youth to the Secretary-General, my journey has been truly wonderful. Today I represent young people from across the globe. I am a testament to what a young Asian woman can achieve if she is empowered, Jayathma noted.
Hailing from Bentota Jayathma schooled at Sangamiththa Vidyalaya, Aluthgama and Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo. A graduate of Colombo University, she is currently reading for her Masters in Development Studies in the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Im here because I was fortunate enough to utilize the opportunities that were made available to me as a Sri Lankan. I am someone who benefitted from the Free Education system, from Grade one to 13 and then in university. Therefore I am obliged to the people of Sri Lanka for the opportunities that were given to me as a young woman from a rural area. These opportunities were made available to me by the people of Sri Lanka from the money of the tax payer and I am grateful to everyone who has contributed in creating my path up to this point in time, she explained.
Jayathma has represented and motivated global youth development on an international level since the age of 21. She was selected as the first ever Sri Lankan youth Delegate to the United Nations (UNYD) in 2012. She was also appointed as a member of the International Youth Task Force for the World Conference on Youth 2014 to ensure inclusive youth engagement in the process and was widely commended for her involvement in advancing the youth agenda in the UN. She was the lead youth negotiator for the Colombo Declaration on mainstreaming youth in the Post 2015 agenda. She played a key role in establishing the United Nations World Skills Day which was a proposal of Sri Lanka for which she was the lead negotiator.
I have also been active in several high-level international initiatives for young people, starting from Rio +20 in 2012 to the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting to the World Conference on Youth, to the negotiations for the high level political forum on post 2015 Sustainable Development Agenda. I worked closely with the UN Country team here in Sri Lanka, especially as a UN volunteer and contributing to the ILO Zero Child Labor campaign in 2013 as a volunteer, Jayathma said.
She has designed and implemented successful training programs for aspiring female politicians, doing her maximum to ensure strong female representation at local and national levels. Though a diplomat she embodies a heart of an activist. Bright, energetic, dedicated and beautiful, Jayathma was ranked island first in the recruitment process to enter the office of the Secretary General of Sri Lankas Parliament in which she served as secretary to the Secretary General of the Sri Lankan parliament from June 2016 to January 2017.
Recalling the turning point in her life Jayathma says that it was becoming the first runner up in the emerging young leader award competition that was organized by the Ministry of Youth Affairs in 2011 which gave her the much needed break in life.
Following this competition, I started working on the National Youth Services Council on their global campaign for the World Conference on Youth in 2014. When the NYSC designed the Youth delegate program I was selected as the first ever UN Youth delegate from Sri Lanka along with Aruthra Rajasingham. This experience inspired me greatly to see how the United Nations can make a difference in the world, she explained.
With her parents and husband at her graduation
Queried on what her most memorable experience was during her tours Jayathma said that it was taking part in the United Nations General Assembly. She was the official youth delegate to the UN selected by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Skills Development and had been able to meet and interact with many people who had inspired her through their work.
The most important contribution Ive made to the global youth development agenda is the UN World Youth Skills Day. I took leadership in 2014 after the World Conference on Youth to bring forth a resolution to the United Nations to declare a World Youth Skills Day on July 15. It was a follow up on the World Youth Conference and also an initiative that was directed and led by Sri Lanka, she added with a smile.
One of her passions is bringing people together. She enjoys creating movements and platforms that bring different stakeholders together.
I worked with certain Non-Governmental Organizations in Sri Lanka to bring young political party leaders together to initiate recommendations for reconciliation and constitutional reform. Ive been working on this specially in conflict affected areas, getting Tamil speaking young politicians to work together with their Sinhalese speaking counterparts in Sri Lanka over the last year. That experience also helped shape my profile in receiving this appointment as someone who advocates for conflict prevention in the long run, Jayathma mused.
Unraveling her thoughts about the role she is assigned to take on soon Jayathma noted that she believes that this is a great opportunity for all stakeholders to come together, especially the member states, the civil society organizations, youth organizations, private sector, academia and all other partners.
As the UN Youth Envoy I will be working very closely with all these partners to create a more tangible and visionary agenda for young people and youth participation in the UN system. Investing in youth development is an investment that they make for the future. This will be one of the slogans that I will be working under, encouraging governments to invest more on youth development, introduce youth policies where there are no youth policies and initiate youth councils where there are no youth councils in the world, she said.
Jayathma will be working alongside the three pillars of the UN: peace and security, development and human rights. Under Peace and Security, She will be working with the Security Council Resolution 2250 on Youth, Peace and Security. Under development she will be focusing on getting young people to take leadership on implementation and evaluation of the Sustainable Development Agenda. Under Human Rights, she will be bonding with youth communities that are most vulnerable and marginalized in the world with an especial focus on young refugees and young women.
The message Jayathma wants to send across to youth who wish to aim high is that if there is a will, then there is a way. She herself has reached for the stars and had succeeded to fulfill her dreams.

According to Bandara, the employees will continue the strike until a favourable response is received by the committee. The strike action by the Joint Postal Trade Unions Front with the support of 24 other postal trade unions is based on three main demands.
Workers are demanding to halt the redevelopment plan to convert the Nuwara-Eeliya, Kandy and Galle Fort Post Offices to profit making ventures while seeking for the reopening of the former General Post Office building in Colombo on Janadhipathi Mawatha. They also seek solutions to administrative issues faced by the staff due to a circular issued in 2006.

RS 7.5 Billion loss as a result of foreign education
Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayaka said the country loses a massive Rs. 7.5 billion annually due to students going abroad for higher education at foreign universities.
Large sums drain out from the country annually as there is not enough room for higher education within the country.
This situation requires the country to make room more higher education opportunities here, he said.
He said with the facilities available within the country only around 30,000 students of the 300,000 students who enter Grade One annually can enrol for Higher Education annually.
But around 160,000 students who sit the Advanced Level Examination qualify for higher studies.There is a huge vacuum for higher studies as there is not enough higher education opportunities.
Therefore, there should be a way for these students to pursue higher education within the country,Rathnayaka said.

SAITM campus to stay private - Rajitha
The government has not taken any decision to nationalise the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), Minister of Health Dr. Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said.
He was speaking at the Cabinet press briefing which was held at the Department of Government Information yesterday.
The minimum standards to medical education will soon be gazetted since it has been a core factor in the SAITM issue, Minister Senaratne added.
Asked whether certain ministers are in disagreement with the decision making process regarding the SAITM, Minister Senaratne assured that no Cabinet Minister voiced dissatisfaction regarding the solutions proposed on the matter. The only problem President Maithripala Sirisena and we as ministers had at the Cabinet meeting was, as to why we continue responding to the GMOA.
No party should demand solutions from the government regarding the SAITM like Shylock asked for the pound of flesh, Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara, speaking on the same issue, said.
No party will be hundred percent satisfied with the solutions given to SAITM. We expect cooperation from all parties to solve this matter, Minister Jayasekara further said.
He said the GMOAs stand point shall not affect the decisions that the government makes on SAITM. He also said, the current issue regarding SAITM is a result of previous regimes doing. We have to bear the burden of their sins now, Jayasekara said.
The Neville Fernando Hospital (NHF) will provide free medical facilities for the public, Minster Dayasiri Jayasekara also said. There shall be paying wards as well at the hospital for the ones who prefer such facilities. he added.
Minister Jayasekara said the administration of the Neville Fernando Hospital (NHF) shall be similar to the administrative structure adopted by the Sri Jayawardenapura General Hospital.The NHF management will be carried out by a Board of Directors appointed by the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister.
Asked on the anti-SAITM protestors who broke into the Health ministry building, Minister Senaratne said one has to figure out the difference between student activists, thugs and terrorists. These anti-SAITM protestors barged into the Health Ministry building like terrorists, he said. We had to control the situation. It was not like these students came into visit the Ministrys Buddha shrine. In 1988, the same people burnt the Health Ministry building down. We cannot allow that. Minister Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne also said there is no mechanism to recover the loss suffered by the Health ministry building from the aggressive behaviour of the anti-SAITM protestors. Legal action will be taken against the students involved in damaging the property of the Health Ministry under the Public Property Act, which does not allow bail for possible offenders, Senaratne said.

Sangakkara first to reach 1,000 first-class runs for season
LONDON, Tuesday: Kumar Sangakkara passed 1,000 first-class runs for the season on the way to his sixth century, an unbeaten 180, as Surrey dominated Yorkshire in County Championship Division One.
Only 30 overs were bowled because of rain on day two at Headingley.
But Sangakkara scored 91 of the 122 runs scored in a delayed first hour of play as Surrey went raced from their overnight 374-6 to 516-7 declared. Yorkshire reached 27-1 in 10.5 overs before the rain returned.
The hosts lost opener Adam Lyth, leg before to Sam Curran, in the eighth over of their reply, while England Test captain Joe Root ended the day unbeaten on 12.
The day-night match is one of nine being played this week to trial floodlit championship cricket featuring a pink ball. Sri Lanka great Sangakkara, 39, reached his century off 136 balls and his 150 off only another 28, hitting 21 fours and four sixes in total.
He shared a 158-run stand for the seventh wicket with new England T20 international Tom Curran (44) to ensure maximum batting bonus points.
His 1,000th championship run of 2017, making him the first to achieve that feat in English cricket this summer, came with a four off Tim Bresnan.
Sangakkara, who played 134 Tests for Sri Lanka between 2000 and 2015, scored the 100th century of his career this month. Yorkshire assistant coach Rich Pyrah said: "Kumar obviously played really well, but I didn't think we hit our lengths as consistently as we can. It's a little bit frustrating. We know how important the new ball is with the pink one before it gets soft. We were inconsistent and let him get away again. But he's a class player. When he's playing like that at the end, it's very difficult to stop him scoring."
Surrey's Tom Curran said: "It was another masterclass from the great man. He's been unbelievable. His record speaks for itself. There's not much more we can say about him - it's all been said. "He's a great player and a great man, and I was honoured to be out there watching him do his thing. It was a great experience for me. He makes it look a lot easier than I do.

Sewage water causing dengue
The residents of the Nintavur Divisional Secretariat area were advised not to let sewage water out to nearby drainages and keep them clean to avoid the spread of mosquitoes, said Nintavur Medical Officer of Health A. Thasleema.
Thasleema said a group of PHI officers visited several houses in the area to inspect whether residents let sewage water out properly.
The drainages near residences become mosquito breeding places and spread dengue. Sewage water produces a bad odour and pollutes the environment. People living nearby breathe polluted air which causes disease, Thasleema said.
Legal action will be taken against perpetrators, Thasleema said.

Shastri to apply for India coach job
New Delhi: Former captain Ravi Shastri will apply to become India's head coach after the national cricket board extended the application deadline following Anil Kumble's shock exit, reports said Wednesday.
"Yes, I have decided to apply for the job," the cricketer-turned-television commentator was quoted as saying by the New Indian Express.
Top names such as former batsman Virender Sehwag and Australia's Tom Moody are already in the running for one of the toughest jobs in cricket.
Shastri applied for the job last year after being team director between 2014-16.
Kumble was appointed instead and coached India to five Test series victories but resigned last week, stating his partnership with India captain Virat Kohli had become "untenable".
Former all-rounder Shastri, 55, has been touted as a strong candidate who has a good relationship with Kohli.
The new coach for the world's number one Test team will be decided by a three-man committee made up of former India stars Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman. Ganguly was reportedly key in Kumble being chosen over Shastri in June last year. The two former captains have publicly rowed over the coach's post.
However Ganguly said of Shastri's renewed candidacy: "Everybody has the right to apply. We will find out."
The Board of Control for Cricket in India has said applications will be accepted until July 9. The BCCI is aiming to announce the new coach before India head to Sri Lanka in July. AFP

SLT to invest 5% of revenue on R&D unit - Harin
Its very disappointing to note that Sri Lankas so-called number one telecommunications service provider, Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), does not have a Research and Development Unit and this is a major flaw, said Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure, Harin Fernando, at the World Trade Centre.
Speaking at the launch of Customer Solutions Innovation and Integration Experience Center (CSIC), one of Huaweis further contributions to support Sri Lankas digital economy, yesterday, he said that not a single cent has being allocated by the company for R&D. Its true that there is a team that develops apps but this is not enough.
He said he will take steps immediately to set up an R&D Unit at SLT and then follow it by allocating 5% of SLT revenue to maintain this unit. He also said that the fourth industrial revolution in the world revolved around digital infrastructure and the government is paying a key emphasis in this area. Minister Fernando said still Sri Lanka offers one of the lowest telecommunications tariffs in the world. He also said he had made several appeals to Sri Lankan telecom companies to set up CSIC Units and only Huawei responded.
The establishment of CSIC is the connection with the MOU that the Sri Lanka government signed with Huawei when Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and I visited Huawei headquarters in China last year. As a leading global ICT company, Huaweis value and contribution will support ICT development in Sri Lanka, said Yang Zuoyuan, Economic and Commercial Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka.
He said that if a country sees a 20% growth in their ICT sector, that nation would see a 1% growth to their GDP.
Commenting on the opening, Shunli Wang, Huawei Sri Lankas CEO said, The establishment of CSIC is one of Huaweis further contributions to support Sri Lankas digital economy and ICT development following the national broadband forum and Seeds for the Future programme we organized last year. We are willing to share our global best practices and experience and work with stakeholders to make innovations and support Sri Lanka to be a digitally empowered nation.

SLTDA grades Tourist Friendly Eating Places
Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLDA), in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Colombo Municipal Council launched a project to encourage the upgrading of food safety, hygiene and service of eating places supplying food for foreign and local tourists.
The project is named Certification Scheme for Tourist Friendly Eating Places. SLTDA is planning to expand this project, initially launched within the Colombo Municipality limits but aims to cover suburbs of Colombo soon. Under the second phase of the project, eating places in Kandy and Galle will be certified.
The SLTDA began inspection visits May 2017, to eating places in Colombo. Based upon the inspection scores, 25 eating places in Colombo Municipal Council area were selected for the certification. The two types of certification are granted in these places with A and B grades.The Certification awarding ceremony was held on June 27th , at Monara Restaurant, Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management under the patronage of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John A.E. Amaratunga.
If we are to sustain the growth of our tourism industry, it is extremely important that we offer quality food and beverage services for tourists. SLTDAs currently ongoing project of certifying Tourist Friendly Eating Places is a step in the right direction in this regard. While some Sri Lankan restaurants are among the best in the world having won international recognition, there is the other end of the spectrum which is not up to the mark. We have to raise the standards of these places, said Minister Amaratunga highlighting the need for certification and standardization of tourism related services.
Sri Lanka Tourism industry has progressed dramatically over five decades to receive an all-time high hit of 2 million annual tourist arrivals at the end of 2016, said Paddy Withana, Chairman of Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority.

An order has been made to all the sports associations to adopt selection criteria when selecting sportspersons to the respective national teams, Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekara said yesterday. There were no such criteria until this decision was made, Minister Jayasekara pointed out.
The Minister was speaking at the Cabinet press briefing yesterday which was held at the Department of Government Information.
The sportsmen had no way to question as to why they were not selected to a team. They have a right to ask so. No one knew how selections were done regarding any national team. Minister Jayasekara pointed out.
The sportspersons who have doubts regarding the selection process can now make an appeal to the National Selection Committee, the Minister said.
The final decision will be made regarding selections by the Minister of Sports, as provisioned by the Sports Act.
One cannot call it a political involvement since it is the same method adopted in all the other countries. he explained.
Minister Jayasekara also said, the fitness levels of the national cricket team was not satisfactory. They have promised to improve their fitness levels within the next coming three months. he said.
Minister Jayasekara also said that he will not give his approval to the selections unless the athletes have provided the certificate issued by the Institute of Sports Medicine regarding their physical fitness.
Questioned on cricketer Lasith Malingas suspension, Minister Jayasekara said he has no personal vendetta against any sportsman or sportswoman.
Jayasekara said he did not intend to isolate one cricketer when he was commenting on the fitness issue of the Sri Lanka cricket team. If, however, someone wears the cap as it fits, I cannot help it.
I have nothing personal against anybody in the Sri Lankan cricket team or against any other sports person in the country. It is important that all feel responsible towards Sri Lanka sports. No responsible party should try to brew animosities between the Minister of Sports and the cricketers. Jayasekara said.

Sri Lanka, India to set up solar unit soon

Sri Lanka will soon kick-start the process of setting up a solar power plant in eastern port town Trincomalee after discussions with India, which is partnering the government in the initiative.
The next step would be to undertake a feasibility study and do the groundwork, spokesman of the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy Sulakshana Jayawardena toldThe Hinduon Wednesday.
In April this year, the Sri Lankan governments of Sri Lanka and India signed a Memorandum of Understanding, for cooperation in a host of development projects including the setting up of a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant in suburban Colombo and a solar power plant in Sampur, Trincomalee.
We have the required land to set up the 50 MW solar plant envisaged in the MoU. We have to now work out the process of executing the project, in consultation with India, Jayawardena said.
NTPC venture
Sri Lanka had initially planned to set up a coal power plant in Sampur, through an international joint venture with Indias National Thermal Power Corporation.
However, in September 2016 the Power Ministry scrapped the project citing environmental concerns.
A month later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met President Maithripala Sirisena in Goa, on the side-lines of the BRICS summit, where he flagged the possibility of New Delhi partnering Colombo in LNG and green energy projects.
Sampur, where the solar plant is set to come up, is located in the strategically important port town of Trincomalee, on the north-eastern coast of the island.
India and Sri Lanka have agreed to jointly operate a world war-era oil storage facility in the town, with the aim of developing it into a regional petroleum hub.
The proposed solar power plant is in line with Soorya Bala Sangramaya (Battle for Solar Energy), an initiative that President Sirisena launched last year to add 220 MW of solar power to Sri Lankas energy grid by 2020.
Currently, the island relies heavily on thermal sources that meet over 70 per cent of the country's energy needs.

In their times of need
Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd joined hands with the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society - Gampaha Branch, to carry out intensive emergency disaster relief and rehabilitation activities following the severe floods which occurred in May 2017. Coca-Cola focused on the immediate needs of distribution of safe, clean water and the provision of medical camps to those left vulnerable in the Biyagama and Dompe Divisions.
The emergency relief operation was mainly carried out in the flood-affected areas of Yabaraluwa, Mabima, Bollegala, Thelwatta, Ambaraluwa of Biyagama Division and Malwana, Kanukatiya, Pahala Mapitigama, Nikawela, Giridhara and Kapugoda of Dompe Division. Furthermore, in a step towards rehabilitation; facilitating the return to their daily lives, the Company engaged in cleaning all contaminated wells of the Biyagama Division, totalling 600 wells.
Echoing the disastrous effects of the floods in 2016, last months natural disaster once again left Gampaha residents feeling vulnerable and isolated by the flood waters, while being exposed to health issues in the aftermath such as the risk of Dengue and waterborne diseases. Flooding from the nearby Kelani River caused water levels to rise 5ft in Biyagama and 3ft in Dompe (Gampaha District).
Volunteers of Biyagama and Dompe Red Cross executed the operation and technical support was provided by the relevant area Government officers; Grama Niladharis, Public Health Inspectors, Ministry of Health and Divisional Secretariats. Volunteers from Coca-Cola were active in the medical camps and in delivering water to affected families and individuals, as additional operational support on the ground in the week after the floods were of great need.
The Company ensured that distribution of over 10,000 litres of water was executed through deliveries on-foot, by trucks and by boat, to access areas isolated by the remaining flood waters. Medical camps, Mobile camps and First Aid services were conducted through 16 service events providing access for essential healthcare to 2,129 affected individuals in the first week after the flooding began. Coca-Cola is grateful to the critical support offered by Sri Lanka Red Cross Society - Gampaha Branch, the Grama Niladharis and the Public Health Inspectors of the Ministry of Health.
Medical Officer of Health, Biyagama, Mrs Kumari Wijesuriya said, The recent floods in Sri Lanka caused devastating loss to life and property, leaving many communities helpless. Many areas in Biyagama were particularly badly affected and residents here needed all the possible relief and rehabilitation assistance. As a state body, we are offering every possible support to this community, however, Coca-Colas support at this crucial time has helped ease our stretched resources. I am grateful for the companys generous support in well-cleaning activities in Biyagama, which will go a long way in supplying clean drinking water to these communities as they slowly limp back to normalcy.
In their return to their daily lives, it was working around the issue of contaminated household wells which prevented homeowners from returning to normalcy.The well-cleaning process involves the cleaning, disinfection and chlorination by professionals from Sri Lanka Red Cross Gampaha Branch. Homeowners in need were identified from the information provided by the Divisional Secretariat and requests by the Grama Niladharis of each division. In all 8 Grama Niladhari divisions, certification for each homeowner was done by the Public Health Inspectors and or Grama Niladharis, Once the process was completed, a sticker was pasted identifying the water from the cleaned wells were safe for drinking, bathing and other day-to-day activities.
Commenting on Coca-Colas flood relief operations, Mayank Arora, Managing Director of Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd said, Coca-Cola responded to the recent floods by providing those affected with access to water and medical camps. More importantly, as a company we are privileged to support the long-term wellbeing of the community by further ensuring access to safe, clean water by undertaking the responsibility to clean 600 wells within the local community of Biyagama.

"I'm heartbroken to say that yesterday morning (Tuesday) I had to say goodbye to my greatest friend and horse of a lifetime, Toytown," read her statement.
"He was the most incredible athlete with the biggest heart, European and World champion back to back.
"He made my career and I couldn't be more grateful to him for the amazing times we had together. He was a huge part of my family, an amazing animal and a true champion.

Some trying to ruin higher education:
University students are duty bound to well utilise public funds allocated annually for higher education, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayaka said.
The minister was addressing the media at Srikotha yesterday.
Undergraduates should make the best use of free education without merely shouting slogans of protecting free education. Free education has been made available with public funds, he said.
The funds allocated for the medical education sector are not utilised since medical students are refraining from attending lectures for nearly one year over the SAITM issue. He said some parties are trying to ruin the higher education sector for political gains.
There is a conspiracy to destroy higher education. Undergraduates have become cat-paws of the conspiracy, Minister Rathnayaka said.
Speaking on the unruly behaviour of the undergraduates who were storming into the Health Ministry recently, the minister said there is a political motive behind the incident.
The activities of undergraduates against SAITM are backed by the Peratugami Party, while a few other parties are fuelling the fire, he said.
The minister said Police had to involve in the case to protect physical and human resources of the ministry.

US military updates Trump's North Korea options

US military options for North Korea have recently been updated and are ready to be presented to President Donald Trump if Pyongyang conducts an underground nuclear or ballistic missile test that indicates the regime has made a significant progress towards developing a weapon that could attack the US, two US military officials told CNN.
National security adviser HR McMaster also confirmed publicly Wednesday that military options had been prepared.
"What we have to do is prepare all options because the President has made clear to us that he will not accept a nuclear power in North Korea and a threat that can target the United States and target the American population," McMaster said during remarks at a Washington think tank.
A day ahead of the visit to Washington by South Korean President Moon, McMaster told a group of defence stakeholders that South Koreans were being "held hostage" by the North Korean regime.
"The threat is much more immediate now. We can't repeat the same failed approach of the past," McMaster said. "The President has directed us to not do that and to prepare a range of options, including a military option, which nobody wants to take."
McMaster said Moon's visit would include discussions on a new approach to North Korea.
"There's recognition that there has to be more pressure on the regime. I think what you'll see in coming days and weeks are efforts to do that," McMaster said.
Other members of the President's national security team have also spoken about Trump's concerns over North Korea.
"I hardly ever escape a day at the White House without the President asking me about North Korea and how it is that the United States is responding to that threat," CIA Director Mike Pompeo told MSNBC's Hugh Hewitt this past weekend. "It's very much at the top of his mind."
Trump last week also indicated he is becoming more concerned.
"The North Korean regime is causing tremendous problems and is something that has to be dealt with, and probably dealt with rapidly," he said.
A defence official said the US is particularly concerned by North Korea's increased ability to hide its testing from the US until the last minute. This gives the US little warning if a missile or nuclear test is about to happen.
While this has worried the US for some time, especially as they move to solid fuelled missiles, the official said the North Koreans continue to make advances in their ability to hide their actions from the US. For example, they are able to quickly drive missiles out of underground shelters and fire them, giving US satellites little or no time to observe pre-launch activities.
They are also diversifying the number of sites from which they launch missiles.
US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley warned lawmakers on Wednesday that the North Korea's missile program may be advancing ahead of previous estimates that put Kim Jong Un's unpredictable regime three to five years away from achieving its ambition of being able to deliver a nuclear weapon to the US.
"You are more optimistic saying it is multiple years before an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) comes forward," she said while testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. "I think it's going to happen sooner, because they are on target to do that."
Every test of a missile or a nuclear device is being closely evaluated to determine if it significantly increases North Korea's capability. But a US preemptive attack continues to be highly problematic option because the Pentagon has long believed North Korea would in turn attack South Korea.
The reliance on China to pressure North Korea diplomatically continues but if Pyongyang conducts another underground test, the US may decide that the strategy is not working.
"All options" are on the table if a test happens, one military official emphasized, while underscoring the hope that diplomatic pressure works.

Venezuelas SC attacked by stolen helicopter: Maduro
VENEZUELA: Venezuela's Army has been put on alert after four grenades were hurled at the Supreme Court from a helicopter, President Nicolas Maduro said Tuesday, in a potentially dramatic escalation of the violence gripping the oil-rich South American country.
The helicopter assault comes a day after Maduro announced the arrests of five opponents he accused of plotting against him to clear the way for a US invasion.
The beleaguered president, who for weeks has been thundering about alleged coup attempts against him, said the helicopter was flown by a pilot who worked for a former minister.
Around 15 shots were fired at the Interior Ministry, Maduro added.
I have activated the entire armed forces to defend the peace, he said in remarks from the Miraflores presidential palace.
Sooner or later, we are going to capture that helicopter and those that carried out this terror attack. No one was hurt in the incident, he said.
The government identified the helicopter pilot as a former member of Venezuela's main police force, known as the CICPC.
Maduro called on the opposition MUD alliance to denounce the attack but one of its leaders, Freddy Guevara, tweeted there was not yet enough information to comment.
Guevara urged people to take part in anti-government rallies Wednesday -- the latest in nearly three months of daily streets protests that have left 76 people dead.
Photos circulating on social media showed a helicopter flying over Caracas with a banner that read 350 Freedom -- alluding to a constitutional clause recently invoked by the opposition to assert the Maduro government's lack of legitimacy.
The photos showed two people on the chopper, one with his face covered with a mask and the other with it visible.
Videos on social media showed a man who identified himself as a CICPC detective and said he was fighting tyranny, wants Maduro to resign and for Venezuela to hold early elections.
Earlier Tuesday, Maduro repeated claims of a US-backed coup attempt and angrily warned President Donald Trump that Venezuela would fight back against such a move.
If Venezuela were dragged into chaos and violence... we would fight, Maduro bellowed in a speech to supporters.
If a coup prevented his side fulfilling his contested reform plans, he said, we would achieve it by arms. He said an armed intervention in his country would spark a crisis that would dwarf those caused by conflicts in the Middle East.
Addressing Trump, he said: You are responsible for restraining the madness of the Venezuelan right-wing.
The opposition regularly accuses Maduro of repressing and jailing opponents. Judicial NGO Foro Penal says there are 383 political prisoners in Venezuela.
