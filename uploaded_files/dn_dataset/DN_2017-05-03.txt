Cristiano Ronaldo scores another Champions League hat-trick

Cristiano Ronaldo scored another Champions League hat-trick as Real Madrid thrashed Atletico Madrid in the semi-final first leg to close in on a third final in four years.
Real were utterly dominant throughout against their city rivals at the Bernabeu and led after 10 minutes when Ronaldo headed home Casemiro's cross.
It looked as if the hosts might fail to fully capitalise on their superiority - until Ronaldo let the ball bounce and smashed an unstoppable shot from 16 yards past Atletico keeper Jan Oblak, who had made several saves to keep his side in the tie.
And the Portugal forward ensured all the headlines would be his with a second consecutive Champions League hat-trick, having scored five goals in the quarter-final against Bayern Munich. It was his easiest goal of the night, as he controlled Lucas Vazquez's cross in plenty of space before firing home.
Atletico only had one shot on target and will need to pull off one of the Champions League's all-time special performances to stop double-chasing Real from ending their European dreams for the fourth straight season.
Ronaldo, the top scorer in the history of the Champions League with 103 goals, loves the big occasion. And occasions do not come much bigger.
He has now scored one more goal - 52 - in the knockout stages than he has in the group stages. He has now scored eight goals in his past three games in the competition, and is up to 13 Champions League semi-final goals.
At the age of 32, Ronaldo has reinvented himself as a striker, rather than the marauding wide player we watched cutting in and shooting for most of his career.
He was not heavily involved for large periods of the game, with only 50 touches of the ball compared with 123 for midfielder Toni Kroos. And he only had five shots - scoring with all of his efforts on target, his only three touches in the Atletico box.
Ronaldo was in an offside position when Sergio Ramos' cross came in for the first goal, but the ball never reached him, instead coming out to Casemiro, who crossed for the Portuguese to head home.
His second came when Karim Benzema held off Diego Godin, and Filipe Luis' follow-up clearance bounced up to Ronaldo, who lashed home.
And he surely wrapped the tie up when he added a third in the 86th minute.
No team has retained the Champions League since its rebranding in 1992, but Real - who were in the swashbuckling form we have seen for most of the season - are in a great position to do so.
Manager Zinedine Zidane, who led his side to last season's trophy with victory over Atletico in the final in his first six months in charge, is chasing a double - and their hopes of a first La Liga title since 2012 are in their hands.
Real - who have now scored in 59 consecutive games - had 17 shots against Atletico on Tuesday, with Benzema going close on several occasions, most notably with a bicycle kick that went just wide from Ronaldo's cross.
Raphael Varane almost scored with a header but was denied by a brilliant Oblak stop, while fellow defender Dani Carvajal, who went off injured at half-time, also forced a save from the Atletico keeper.
Such is the strength of Zidane's squad that Wales forward Gareth Bale, out with a calf injury, was not missed at all - with replacement Isco impressing.
And now, on the back of their first clean sheet in this year's tournament, they will surely fancy their chances against Juventus or Monaco in the Cardiff final on Saturday, June 3.
Atletico have spent most of their history in the shadows of Real so it is of extreme irritation to them that one of their best periods has seen them regularly thwarted by their rivals.
This is the fourth year in a row the teams have met in the latter stages of the Champions League - with Real winning the 2014 and 2016 finals, and the 2015 quarter-final.
Atletico looked a shadow of the team Diego Simeone has turned into one of the most feared in the world. They only had 38% of the ball on Tuesday and, in the first half, misplaced 21.5% of their passes.
Atletico only managed four efforts on goal, with Diego Godin's easily saved header the only one on target.
Simeone, who led Atletico to the 2013 Spanish league title, now faces arguably the toughest test of his managerial career next week in the final European match at the Vicente Calderon before their move to a new stadium.
Man of the match - Cristiano Ronaldo (Real Madrid)
Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone:
"We need to forget about this game.
"It seems impossible, but it is football and football has these unexpected things that make it marvellous.
"Until the last drip of hope is gone, we will give it everything we have."
Real boss Zinedine Zidane:
"Cristiano is a goalscorer. He is unique. All the players were brilliant.
"I am happy with what I am doing here and with the players, we played a great game. We can hurt any side with our weapons."
The stats you need to know - Ronaldo levels Messi hat-trick record
Ronaldo has equalled Barcelona forward Lionel Messi's total of seven Champions League hat-tricks.
His treble saw him become the first player to reach 50 goals in the knockout stages of the competition (52).
Ronaldo now has 13 semi-final goals in the Champions League (10 for Real Madrid, three for Manchester United) - the most by any player.
The Portugal international has also scored more Champions League goals (103) than opponents Atletico Madrid (100).
None of the previous five teams to lose a Champions League semi-final first leg by three or more goals have reached the final.
Atletico suffered their joint-worst Champions League defeat under Diego Simeone, having also lost by a three-goal margin (4-1) against Real Madrid in the 2014 final.
Real kept their first clean sheet in the competition since last year's semi-final against Manchester City (in both legs), ending a run of 11 successive games without one.

Crop insurance paid to paddy extended to five main crops
The crop insurance that has so far covered only paddy cultivation has been extended to cover other major five food crops, as announced by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake at the Budget-2017.
The Government has already launched a two-year National Food Production Programme to ensure self-sufficiency in potatoes, big onions, chillies, maize and soya beans.
The farmers of these crops will also receive crop insurance. and will be paid compensation up to Rs. 10,000 per acre for crop damages in any natural calamity. The agricultural insurance scheme is funded by 1 percent levy charged from the profits of all registered banks, financial institutions and the insurance companies since 2013. This levy is credited to the National Insurance Trust Fund from which the farmers are paid compensation through the Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board.
The farmers whose crops were affected during the drought in the Maha season were paid up to Rs 10,000 per acre last month.
The government introduced the National Loan Protection Scheme in 2016 to provide further relief to farmers who could not repay their bank loans due to damages caused to their crops.
The National Loan Protection Scheme initiated for the purpose, on behalf of the farmers, will pay their banks loan outstanding after having assessed the crop damages. The government has estimated that Rs. 500 M will have to be paid to banks in lieu of the loan obtained by the farmers during 2016/2017 Maha season.
Even this scheme is supported by the levy charged on the banks and financial institutions
The National Insurance Trust Fund since the introduction of the 1 percent levy on profits of the banks, financial and insurance institutions has so far received Rs 5,069.81 million and disbursed Rs 3,932.34 million as the payment for crop damages and other relief to farmers.
Another Rs 500 million has been earmarked to be provided to the Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board to provide relief to farmers under the National Loan Protection Scheme.

Cycling along...
I decided to avoid cycling through Colombo. Conveniently, there's a small town called Negombo near the airport. And 2km from Negombo is Negombo beach, which is full of guest houses and tourist restaurants. The ride from the airport was straight forward. There's not too much traffic, not too much honking, the traffic lights work, and people seem to obey them.
In Negombo, I found a room in the house of Cedric Seneviratne. The street is named for Cedric's father who owned DC (desicated coconut) Oil and Fibre Mills and built four houses in the street for his four kids. Cedric is 86. And a character. I gave him my passport, he wrote down the number and my name. There were four women moving out, and as soon as they'd left, Cedric said I could move into their room and freshen up. I asked if the room needed a clean. He said, "Oh ... no ... here's the broom. It'll be fine".
Ok, I said, trying hard to suppress a smile. I asked if he had clean sheets. He looked puzzled a bit and wandered off. I went to unpack. A while later, he called out "Gwyn, Gwyn", and came with a sheet. "Very good sheet", he said. "Best".
Cedric worked in Britain for seven years in the late 50s-60s. He was an automotive engineer. "Of sorts", he said. Turned out he was the Chief Engineer at a top Sri Lankan motor company for years. And a famous racing driver. Won all the five circuit races of Sri Lanka, plus lots of road races too. He even built his own racing car out of a chassis imported from England and a Sri Lankan engine and body. There was a laminated newspaper article, a recent one, about him on the wall.
Cedric sent me down the road for rice and curry. But the place didn't serve rice and curry, it served expensive fish'n'chips. So I got on my bike and went to town and on the way found rice and curry with fish for Rs100. Very nice. Different flavours from Indian curries.
The tourist area of Negombo is relatively expensive. No Sri Lankans eating in the restaurants.
I walked down the beach, past cuddling teenage couples under umbrellas, outriggers, resorts. There were lights strung up in the streets for St Sebastian (Negombo is predominantly catholic). A parade through the town. I ate a lovely rice cake filled with sugar and coconut that someone gave me. Sat and watched a fabulous sunset.
Next day I caught an early bus for Colombo to extend my visa (I got 30 days on entry). The whole process took around two hours (you need a passport-sized photo). Lots of ex-Sri Lankans applying for visas along with the tourists. I sat next to a guy who lived in Ireland. He was Tamil. Had given up his Sri Lankan passport as a form of protest. Now his mother was sick and he wanted to stay for a bit.
From the bus, I saw: McDonalds, pawn shops, semi-trailers, nice cars, massive supermarket-type things. Arpico in Negombo is Wal-Mart-esque. And cyclists. Road cyclists. Real ones clad in lycra. A guy on his own. Two guys together. Another guy. A woman. A bunch of guys... On fancy road bikes...
Colombo was very busy. Lots of traffic. But fairly clean. There are bins that people use. Went to the National Museum (good, but quite a few galleries were closed). Bought a map of the country published by the Survey Dept. Seems fine. Sheltered for an hour or so from a thunderstorm and torrential rain. Got wet. Got the bus back. The trip took over two hours (40km) - there was some surface flooding, and rush hour didn't help things. Ate kotthu string hoppers for dinner. Rice noodles chop-chop-chopped with veges.
A few days in Negombo... It rained all night and most of the day. Not hard. Drizzly and sometimes worse. I shall sit out the rain. And also wait out the cold I have picked up. Annoying this cold.
Cedric asked me to buy him Strepsils and multi vitamins. And chocloate of a certain sort - he collects the wrappers as part of some competition. "I'll get you some money", he said. He is infirm, unsure on his feet. He got up from his plastic chair and tapped the ground with his walking stick, making sure the rubber stopper wouldn't slip. Then he shuffled off, sliding little more than half a foot length at a time.
Yesterday, I told him I was missing my cycle computer. And my headlamp. His cleaner arrived earlier that morning and Cedric asked me if I wanted the guy to sweep my room. I said, sure. Cedric said to stay with him. But I didn't stay long, left him alone in my room. Later on, I wanted to know the time but couldn't find the little computer, which is my watch. I searched everywhere. Noticed, too, that the torch was gone. My old Che Guevara t-shirt was outside, hanging over an electrical cable. So I told Cedric and asked if he could ask his cleaner if he'd seen my watch and torch. I said he may have swept them away accidentally...

DCS launches Lanka Stat
The Department of Census and Statistic (DCS) launches its first mobile data dissemination App named Lanka Stat on 26 April, 2017, the Director General of Census and Statistics, Dr. Amara Satharasinghe said.
The Lanka Stat mobile application, in the first stage, works of Android operating system (OS) based smart phones including Table PCs.
The main objective of this development is to enhance the the timelines and efficiency of data dissemination by sending demographic and socio economic indices related by the department directly to mobile phones of the data users.
The Lanka Start Android App could be obtained and get installed on an Android OS based smart pone after searching for the text Lanka Stat in Google Play Store. Lanka Stat installed smart phones display a message soon after the update or release of a statistic is made by the department and the data uses are given an opportunity to get an early and continuous update to be informed about the release of statistics of the DCS.
The department gives priority to use the Information and Communication Technology Tools to disseminate statistical information to data users in a timely manner to further facilitate and promote evidence based decision making.
The department also launched a sub website named Lanka Stat Map as the newest member to its sub web family on 26 April, 2017. This state of the art sub website could he successes with any PC or a smart phone using the official web address map statistics.gov.lk or through the link provided to it on home page of DCS main website www.statistics.gov.lk.
The LankaStatMap site is able of display the spatial differences of the statistics disseminated by the DCS for Administrative units (Province, District, Divisional Secretariat and Grama Niladhari division) in many different views using geographical maps.
The main advantage the data uses get when using the Lanka Stat Map website is being able to analyse the DCS statistics comparatively with the geographical information available in different types of Satellite images and Road maps, on which the LankaStatMap sub web site interactively displays the regional statistics.
As a first step, the information collected in Sri Lanka Census of Population and Housing-2012 are included in the Lanka StatMap sub website and the data is disseminated at all the administrative levies from Province down to the Grama Niladhari Division level, which is smallest administrative level of the country.
By selecting an administrative area, all the data related to the selected area could be displayed and analysed as above.
The department expects that the development of LankaStatMap sub website would be an important turning point in the way of providing data to meet development targets of the country as dissemination of statistics related to an administrative unit with all the available geographical information of it gives more power to decision makes and brings more benefits which was a long felt need of the country.

Demons delight
Bringing horror factor to the big screen had been a challenge to filmmakers from the inception of world cinema. Cinema personalities like Peter Cushing with Christopher Lee and Alfred Hitchcock to name a few brought horror and suspense to cinema in a credible manner.
This trend was brought forward for decades by filmmakers by inducing profound attributes to the subject. With the dawn of digital era, horror films were taken to a different level with the use of gripping special effects.
Sri Lankan cinema too from its inception used horror factor to entertain masses though in tiny proportions. In early Sinhala films the element of horror only came in few scenes to add spice to the main story. Fully fledged Sinhala horror films like Zoom, Maya and were made only in recent times.
Bandhanaya a 3D horror film directed by Udayakantha Warnasuriya is the latest one adding to the list.
Bandhanaya has a story woven around hostility between two closely related families living in a remote village. Differences are created within these families over inheritance of ancestral property. Two cousins, Dingirala and Menikhami who have mastered the art of dealing with the occult thus become archrivals.
Menikhami using black magic creates a Pilliya (zombie) to kill his cousin Dingirala. Rift between the two families heightens. The little child in one family becoming victim of circumstances is possessed by a ferocious demon and the need for an exorcism arises.
Udayakantha Warnasuriya is an artiste who seeks to bring novelty to his creations whether it is cinema or painting. He makes films of different genres and Bandhanaya is his first horror film. Making Bandhanaya as a black and white 3D film is significant. Warnasuriya has given a special treatment to the film by associating with local folklore that talk of Yakkas or demons as Maha Sona and including witchcraft, black magic, possession and exorcism in the screenplay.
High expectations were set prior to releasing of the film and the film trailer that was mind blowing too aroused interest of filmgoers.
But did the film live up to the anticipated level The story unfolds on screen lacks the most important ingredient in a horror film which is, igniting the horror factor. Thus whether the film lived up to the expectations of viewers is questionable.
First half of the film flows credibly keeping the viewers intact and making them wonderwhat will happen next. Witchcraft performed by Menikhami at the cemetery is shot extremely well and projected with much credibility and those scenes keep viewers absorbed to the film with much eagerness.
Special effects used in these scenes are very appropriate and they add immense value to the eerie scenes. Apparition of the demon Maha Sona is projected credibly in these scenes with special effects, doing justice to this unusual and mega powerful phenomenon.
Folklore describes Maha Sona otherwise known as Ritigala Jayasena as a ferocious and gargantuan demon that is taller than a coconut tree and having a cranium of a wild bear turned backwards.
Second half of Bandhanaya deals with the possessed child and exorcisms performed to make her sober. Scenes involving the processed child may remind someone of the Hollywood film, The Exorcist screened decades back. Bandhanaya story starts losing its credibility and the local touch here.
The director in the final scenes brings Maha Sona to life and makes a mere mortal (Hemal Ranasinghe) wrestle with this extraordinary demon. Once projected big, Maha Sona in the final scenes of the film thus becomes a phenomenon like Gopalu Yaka in Warnasuriyas film Ran Kevita.
Adding more damage to this the makeup artiste drastically fails to create the physical formation of Maha Sona. Poor physical outlook of the demon has directly contributed towards tarnishing credibility brought to the same character with special effects in the early scenes.
However sound effects, special effects and music scores elevate the film to a healthier platform. Cinematography of Bandhanaya is credible but the frames capturing gestures of the possessed child seem copied from Hollywood films like The Exorcist or The Forest.
Projecting the demons eye view of humans in a novel manner as if looked from a different dimension showcases excellent creativity by the director Warnasuriya.
Veteran actor Syril Wickramage as Menikhami does his part so well that no viewer may think he is acting. Priyankara Ratnayake and Ravindra Yasas too have understood their parts well and brought in credible performances.
Hemal Ranasinghe with his performance in Bandhanaya proves he can pump life to any character coming his way, be it an urbanized citizen or a village folk. Dulani Anuradha seems casted wrong for the character and her distracted performance throughout the film hinder credibility of other performances. Nilmini Tennakoon and Suvinitha Weerasinghe do not have characters to play thus they become passengers or glamour girls.
End scene of the film is very similar to a Hollywood horror film.
All-in-all Bandhanaya could be treated a horror film with a difference made with a screenplay that involves Sri Lankan folklore. However the screenplay having a very local touch in the start deviates from that midway losing momentum and paving way for a less credible creation.
Thus, what would have been a monumental film in the Sri Lankan film history finally becomes yet another horror movie mainly for the reasons, using Hollywood tactics and weaknesses in the screenplay.

Donald confident Malinga will deliver
South African fast bowling legend Allan Donald also known as White Lightning expects Sri Lankas spearhead of the bowling attack Slinger Lasith Malinga to make his mark in the Champions Trophy when he returns from injury to play in his first ODI in two years.
Commenting on Malinga who is currently playing in the IPL for Mumbai Indians, Donald said, From my experience coming back from injuries like Malingas I am sure he would have planned the way he is going to come back. He knows what he needs to perform at optimum level, he is world class and he is the leader of the bowling group. A shrewd character he would know what it takes to take Sri Lanka all the way.
With our management, medical and support staff looking after him, miles in the legs is probably what he needs right now.Twenty20 cricket is not ideal but the calibre and quality that Malinga is he will perform for Sri Lanka. I feel if its once in the heart you know whats required, said Donald who represented South Africa in 72 Tests and became the first bowler from his country to capture 300 Test wickets.
Donald also played in 164 ODIs for South Africa and took 272 wickets.
Head coach Graham Ford said that he is confident that Malinga would make an impact in the Champions Trophy.
Lasith is very determined to make an impact, he has been working hard on his fitness but even if he not giving us the full 10 overs he is a class act who can take wickets upfront and finish the innings off, said Ford.
I am confident that Malinga will be 100 percent fit. I am not looking at him going to operate on one leg. All reports indicate that he is doing well. I spoke to Mahela (Jayawardene, coach of Mumbai Indians) a couple of times and when they left him out the first time I thought there might be something wrong.
But Mahela said its nothing wrong but theyve got plans to win the competition and dont want to play him all the way through. All the indications are that he is going to give us something special. As time runs out in his career he is determined to make an impact.

It is now up to us to give it our all in the middle and firmly raise the flag on high.
Manager Cricket Asanka Gurusinha said: I am most pleased that this administration is quite literally pulling out all the stops when it comes to strategic investment in the cricketing area. Sri Lanka has all the talent in the world, but needs a solid injection of technology and expert input to get it where it needs to be, and that is exactly what this administration is giving it.  ST

Eagles sue Mexican Hotel California for false association with famous song

The rock bandEagleshave filed a lawsuit accusing a hotel in Mexico of using the name Hotel California - the bandsGrammy award-winning songfrom 1976 - without permission.
In a complaint filed in the Central District of California court on 1 May, theEagles allege that owners of the 11 room hotel in Baja California Sur actively encourage visitors to believe it is directly affiliated with the band.
Multipleonline reviewsmake clear that US consumers who visit the Todos Santos Hotel and buy Defendants merchandise do, in fact, believe that the Todos Santos Hotel is associated with the Eagles, which is not the case, courtdocuments say.
Through advertising targeted to US consumers, and in-person communications, Defendants lead US consumers to believe that the Todos Santos Hotel is associated with the Eagles and, among other things, served as the inspiration for the lyrics in Hotel California, which is false.
The hotels false connections with the group have been encouraged by piping Hotel California and other Eagles songs through its sound system, it is alleged. The Eagles also claim that the defendant, Hotel California Baja LLC, had applied to register the Hotel California name with the US Patent and Trademark Office.
According to the documents, the Todos Santos hotel was named Hotel California when it opened in 1950, but after new owners  a Canadian couple, John and Debbie Stewart  bought it in 2001, it is alleged they began using the original name inmarketing and merchandise.
The hotels owners have yet to comment publicly about the allegations.

Easy ways to minimize your phone addiction
Funny thing: Your phone is designed to make you addicted. So we consulted with expertsa neuroscientist and a monkfor practical advice on Zen-ing out your phone.
Heres an embarrassing story: The other day, I was heading out from my apartment to pick up some food. It was so nice out that I thought: Ill just leave my phone and enjoy the walk. But then, as I opened my door: Wait. What if I get stuck in the elevator Who would I call HOW would I call What would I DO waiting for the cops to arrivejust sit there Do the police even show up for stuck elevators So I took my phone. I did not get stuck in the elevator.
Chances are that even if youre not as hopeless as me, youd likely still own up to using your phone more than youd like toand yet youd probably just as readily agree that the idea of parting with our phones for an extended period of time (say, like, a work day) is not just anxiety-inducing; its wildly impractical. Completely unplugginggoing on a phone-free retreat, for instancecan be a healthy, productive experience, but at some point, youre going to return to the world of outlets. Or, as Sensei Ron Hogen Green, a monk and one of the teachers at the Zen Center of New York City, puts it: If the Buddha were alive now, dont you think hed have a phone Of course he would.
Okay, but what would the Buddhas iPhone look like Can you Zen out your phone How do you maximize productivity and minimize distracting black holes Wheres the happy medium between touching your iPhone 80 times a day and not touching it at all Ultimately, that answer is highly personal, and will depend on what you want to get out of your phone (hopefully its probably not 116 weeks deep in your ex-girlfriends Instagram). But we did get a monk and a neuroscientist to offer helpful insights, which we then used to derive what we hope are equally helpful tips.
Let yourself off the hook: Your dependency is not (entirely) your fault.
Ramsay Brown, a neuroscientist whos on the Dopamine Labs team that created the app Space, which delays the time between opening an app and receiving the stimulus that delivers an addictive hit of dopamine (a like; a notification; a text), says that the reason you like being on your phone so much is by design.
"The people who get to call the shots about your social-media stream and your attention span don't have your best interests in mind. You are not the customer of these things. You are the thing being sold. They know you can't leave the home without it. And they know they can move ad units off of that, he says. You have robots being given directives about brand preference and then, behind the scenes, subtly tuning frequencies and ratios and schedules of when you should be shown ads or high-fives or notifications, blindly optimizing you for some consumptive funnel for the highest bidder. That is not a sci-fi dystopia. That is Tuesday.
Pretty dark, huh So what to do
Put it on "Do Not Disturb"even during the day.
We don't just like our dopamine. We like it fast. And these days, we get it fast. Too fast, says Brown: "Your brain was wired for: I better go out and foragethis is gonna take me a while. Okay, I found the food. The food is tasty. Great. Nothing about our built environment today has any bearing on the way we were wired evolutionarily, especially when it comes to the digital context. The same computing performance pressures that made your phone better, your TV flatter, and the porn in more HD are making your phone quicker. Inadvertently, we've taken the delay between when your soul itches a little bitthat moment of boredom or frustration or lonelinessand getting to scratch it with that little hit: Let me open Facebook for a sec. And we are not wired for that speed."- www.gq.com

Elephant reserve to lose 450 hectare of land
Wild Elephants in the Wayamba reserves may stand to lose 450 hectare of their habitat due to human activities. If all parties concerned including the people show some flexibility and agree to the programme drawn up by the Wild Life Department, the human-elephant conflict in Wayamba could be easily resolved, said Assistant Director of Wild Life Wayamba region A H Sumanadasa.
He said that according to the latest census there are a total of 6,000 elephants in Sri Lanka and 1,063 of them are in Wayamba Wild life zone.
The Pallekelle reserve in Kahalla, the only habitat of elephants in Wayamba is threatened. Due to the Wayamba Ela and Irudeniyawa development projects and forcible acquisition of land belonging to the Hakwatunewa wewa for the creation of human settlements.
Although the department planned to enclose the Hakwatunewa wewa to the Kahalla reserve by erecting an electrified fence, the plan had been obstructed due to forcible land grabbing in the area.
He said under the human-elephant reconciliation programme named Divi Surekuma launched on the directions of Wild Life Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera, a project had been initiated from Wegadara village to erect electrified fences to secure villages from elephant attacks, Sumanadasa said.

Ensure release of 5 fishermen detained in SL, Palanisami tells Modi

Chief Minister Edappadi K Palanisami wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday seeking his intervention in ensuring the release of five Tamil Nadu fishermen arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy on Sunday, the Deccan Chronicle reported.
In a letter to Modi, Palanisami said the five fishermen set out to sail in a traditional fishing craft from Pamban fishing base of Ramanathapuram District and were apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy on April 30.
The boat and fishermen have been taken to Jaffna and it is reported that the fishermen are remanded to judicial custody. the CM said in the letter.
Such incidents of arrest of Indian fishermen can only be seen as an act to derail attempts to sort out the issues relating to fishing in the traditional waters of Palk Bay through diplomatic efforts of the respective Governments, Palanisami said, adding that this also sends out a demoralizing message to fishermen from Tamil Nadu.
It is important that the Government of India communicates to the Sri Lankan side in firm, clear, unequivocal and unambiguous terms that these trends have to be reversed and that the Government of India is firmly committed to protect the livelihood of the poor and innocent fishermen from Tamil Nadu who are engaged in their traditional occupation of fishing in their traditional waters, Palanisami said.

Speaking to Daily News Online the former MP said the decision by the Appeals Court was unfair as she was elected to Parliament by public vote.
This even challenged the positions of the rest of the Parliamentary body, she said.
The Court of Appeal today ruled that Geetha Kumarasinghe was disqualified from her position as Member of Parliament, because she holds dual citizenship in Sri Lanka and Switzerland.
A writ petition was filed by five residents of Galle district challenging the constitutionality of Kumarasinghe appointment as a Member of Parliament.
As per Article 91(1)(d)(xiii) of Section 20 of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, no citizen of Sri Lanka who is also a citizen of any other country is qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament or to sit and vote in Parliament.

Addressing the UNP May Day rally held on May 1 in Colombo, he said the former President lied about the loans obtained by the government. All investigations into murders, corruption and malpractices of the previous regime should be completed before the next years May Day celebration. Names and details of the persons who stand in the current regime and protect the Rajapaksas will be revealed.
The Minister said others were shown on state television channels after showing the entire Rajapaksa family during the previous regime. Now the media has been given freedom.
But the media try to bring back the previous regime. It was innocent poor people who brought in good governance, so their hopes should be fulfilled.
A national government can be formed even after 2020. The Constitution will be changed and the Government will face a referendum without any fear. Strikes should not be launched and problems should be resolved through discussions, he said.

How to build a perfect road-ready camera kit
With mobile phones that feature sophisticated cameras in the hands of most travelers, taking photos has never been easier. But if you want to level up your Instagram game with quality images beyond the typical smartphone fare, follow our tips for picking and packing a travel photography kit.
Selecting your system
Theres a perfect setup for every kind of adventure  pack according to the likeliest scenarios youll encounter and stay mindful of factors like climate, seasonality, the local culture and the length of your trip. Pick the proper camera system for yourself  think about features and controls youll need and get familiar with them long before you hit the road.
Bodies
DSLRs by big brands like Canon and Nikon have long been the go-to brands for serious shooters, but lighter and smaller mirrorless options are gaining traction with hobbyist and professional photographers alike. Mirrorless systems like the Fujifilm X Series (fujifilm-x.com) or Sony Alpha (alphauniverse.com) have the advantage of being extremely compact half the size of traditional DSLRs  and many models host interchangeable lenses for an image quality thats superior to point-and-shoot cameras.
Lenses
Lens selection depends on the nature of the trip and your planned itinerary. In general, opt for wide angle lenses (20mm and lower) for landscapes and telephoto lengths (50mm or higher) for shooting faraway subjects.
A versatile zoom lens that shoots from wide angle to telephoto provides enough range to capture a variety of travel scenes and situations. On the other hand, prime (fixed focal length) lenses are often more compact and an overall better choice for their faster optics and broader aperture settings. You cant zoom with these lenses, which can be a good thing  it forces you to interact more with the environment as you work toward that perfect shot.
Select primes that cover a range of bases: 50mm is a popular standard lens with a field of view that closely resembles the human eye; 35mm is a good wide length for landscapes, street scenes and architecture; 85mm is a solid choice for portraiture. When shooting wildlife, pick primes between 300mm and 600mm. Because animals tend to move quickly, a telephoto zoom lens ranging from 70mm to 400mm is also a good option.
Filters
Thanks to digital editing, the use of filters on camera lenses to modify an image isnt as necessary as it used to be, but there are still a couple of useful ones. UV filters cut atmospheric haze and protect your lens (many opt to leave them on at all times). Circular polarizer filters are good landscapes; they can boost color saturation, reduce glare and cut reflections on water or glass.
Flash
With the world as your studio, its typical to rely on available light when shooting your travels. That said, a flash can be beneficial when the ambient light isnt sufficient indoors or when youre trying to capture quickly-moving subjects outdoors at night. Luckily, hot shoe mount flash units are compact enough to pack with ease. For travel photography, use through the lens (TTL) metering rather than manual flash for travel photography. The unit to select depends on the cameras brand, as most are only compatible with specific models. - Lonely Planet

How to Change Your Eating Patterns
Many of us are trapped in our old, hardened eating patterns. In fact, we might not even be aware of the patterns, but we do know that 1) wed like to get healthier or leaner; 2) we have a hard time making eating changes; 3) we dont always know how to change.
Those are good realizations! It means we have to humble ourselves, and find a way to put ourselves into an area of uncertainty and discomfort in order to change.
Some common eating patterns that are difficult to change: Snacking on junk foodSugary drinks like sodas or Starbuck sugary coffee drinksBingeing in the eveningEating out a lot and making unhealthy choices, then regretting itNeeding comfort foods when youre stressed or feeling downYou start drinking and then you eat like crap And more, of course. These are just some common examples. Do you have any of these Are there others you arent aware of but that keep you locked into a less-than-healthy lifestyle
If youre ready to make a change, lets look at how to change our eating patterns.
Before we look at how to change the patterns, lets take a look at the common obstacles. Dont get discouraged by this list! Changing is definitely possible, as my own life shows. Ive changed my entire diet completely, and while Im not perfect by any means, I have confidence in my ability to change my patterns if I want to.
Some common obstacles:
Being motivated by guilt, fear, regret: Studies show that these motivations are very common, and they dont work well. Instead, change that sticks is motivated by a positive outlook and self-motivation.
Vague or too many goals: If you have a specific plan, rather than eating healthier, thats more likely to succeed. If you try to change too many things at once (exercise, diet, meditation, decluttering, procrastination!), youll use up your limited energy and discipline.
Depriving ourselves: If you are on a diet, and it feels like a sacrifice and deprivation, you wont be able to stick to that for long. Instead, eat high-volume foods like vegetables and beans that fill you up and dont leave you hungry, and eat indulgent but healthy foods like a few squares of dark chocolate, berries, relaxing tea, a glass of red wine. Make it feel like a wonderful lifestyle rather than self-flagellation.
Not having practical ways to get there: Its great to have a goal to lose weight, but how will you do it Most people only have a vague idea of what to do, and it can be confusing. Its best to have a practical plan. More in the next section.
Too much choice & variety: If you go to a buffet and theres a hundred delicious-looking foods there, youll probably overeat.
The same is true at home or wherever we normally eat  if you always have lots of choices, with tempting varieties, youll probably overeat.
But if you went somewhere where there was just one choice, and it was healthy, youd probably do much better.
Social eating: Eating out with friends or going to parties can make it difficult  mostly because of the above reason of too much choice and variety. But also because were not mindful of our choices when were talking to people, and also we might feel pressure to eat like everyone else instead of making healthy choices.
Resistance to healthy foods: Lots of people dont like vegetables. Or beans, raw nuts, whole grains. I know people who would rather die than eat brown rice, oats, kale or drink soymilk. This is a barrier to changing eating patterns.
Not realizing your patterns: Many people arent really aware of what their eating patterns are. It can be hard to figure it out unless youre forced to see it in the cold harsh light of day.
Healthy eating is confusing: Theres a lot of advice out there, so many things to learn about. To combat that, pick a simple, whole-foods diet and just stick to a simple plan. Veggies, fruits, beans, nuts, whole grains. Drink water, tea, maybe a bit of red wine. Simple!
Depending on willpower: If you have to stare donuts in the face, then French fries, then sumptuous dessert  you will run out of willpower. Instead, change your environment, and make things easy on yourself.
Its not convenient: When youre hungry, tired, stress, or lonely  youll reach for whats easy. Instead, get rid of the junk and have convenient snacks (I like hummus and carrots, and apples and raw nuts).
You think its expensive: Healthy eating can be seen as super expensive.
Actually, it can be even cheaper: try lentils! A lentil soup with potatoes or some brown rice is super cheap. Add some frozen green veggies and you have an incredibly healthy, simple meal for very little.
OK, that might seem like a lot of obstacles. But being aware of them is key, and now that weve looked at them, lets talk about some solutions, and how to shake up our eating patterns. - Zen Habits

How to secure your online accounts
Every once in a while, an app like Unroll.me pops into the spotlight to remind us that we all tend to authorize a lot of apps to access our email and social media accounts without much thought. Sometimes, as in the case of Unroll.me, those apps get busy selling off our data. Nows a good time to audit any other third-party apps youve given access to your accounts.
A lot of web apps these days request access to another account. Sometimes thats because theyre adding something to that service, other times its simply because of a service called OAuth, which grants an app access to an account using a token. Either way, the whole point of the system is that you can instantly revoke access away from the third-party app with just a few clicks. This makes it easy to audit and get rid of any of those random apps you try for a day and then forget about. If you dont remember an app, an app is free and you dont understand the business model, or it just doesnt sound familiar, its a good idea to ditch it. So, with that, lets go ahead and give ourselves a good old fashioned audit.
Google
Head to the Apps Connected to Your Account Page (Profile picture > My Accounts > Sign in & Security > Connected apps & sites > Manage apps). Click on the apps you want to revoke access from, click remove, then click Ok.
Microsoft
Head to the Apps page (Accounts > Privacy, then scroll down to Apps and Services). Click Edit next to the app you want to remove, then click Remove these permissions.
Yahoo!
Head to the Manage App and Website Connections page (Click your profile icon > Account Info > Recent Activity), then click Remove next to any apps you want to revoke access from.
Bizarrely, Flickr has its own page for doing this, ridiculously called the App Garden. Head to The App Garden Page (Click your Profile > Settings > Sharing & Extending, then click Edit next to Account Links), then click Revoke permission next to any apps you want to remove.
AOL
Head to the Site Permissions page (Login to MyAccount > Account Options > Manage Site Permissions), then click Remove for any apps you want to remove access from.
Facebook
Head to the App Page (Settings > Apps > App Settings > Show All), mouseover an application, then click the X icon to remove an app. Because this is Facebook, youll have to do this individually for each app, and the list tends to awkwardly rearrange itself each time you remove an app.
Twitter
Head to your Apps page (Profile picture > Settings and Privacy > Apps), then click Revoke Access on any apps you no longer want to access Twitter. For some reason, these apps will hang there for a few minutes allowing you to undo revoking access if you have a change of heart.
Instagram
Head to your Authorized Applications page (Click the gear icon > Authorized Apps from the web app, you cant do this in the mobile app for some reason). Click the Revoke Access button on any apps you want to remove.
LinkedIn
Head to the Permitted Services section (Profile > Account > Partners and Third Parties) and click Revoke next to any services you want to remove. Chances are that most of these will look a little weird to you because theyre bizarrely named job application sites like iCIMS or Greenhouse.
Dropbox
Head to your Apps Linked page (Profile Icon > Settings > Security). At the bottom of the page, youll see a list of all the apps youve granted access to Dropbox. Click the X next to each one then Uninstall to remove it.
This was my own personal worse offender on this list, as there was a good 20 or so apps that Id never bothered to remove here.

ICTA implements online ePolice Clearance Certificate system for SL Police
An ePolice Certificate system was developed by the Information & Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) for the Sri Lanka Police for the issuance of Police Clearance Certificates (PCC) online.
This system was officially launched recently at a ceremony graced by the Inspector General of Police, Pujith Jayasundara accompanied by several other Senior DIGs, as well as Doctor Ajith Madurapperuma, Deputy Chairman from ICTA along with other senior officials.
The comprehensive solution being implemented, fully automating the internal systems of the Police Clearance Branch will be a remarkable milestone in the history of the Sri Lanka police as it puts an end to the stringent manual process in use.
In the prevailing context where countries all over the world are vigilant over the potential security threats caused by migrants, PPC is a mandatory requirement for anyone intending to migrate or apply for work permits and even for Sri Lankans living aboard, when seeking for new employment.
Currently, the Clearance Branch receives approximately 150 applications per day from locals and nearly 300 weekly from Sri Lankans living abroad, while nearly 600 applications come in per day merely from locals residents.
The Deployment of the Application for the Clearance Branch, as the first phase of the project, was implemented in 2016.
Consequently, as of now, within the Clearance Branch, the internal systems have been fully automated including application processing, monitoring and tracking in order to ensure that applications are responded to with efficacy.
In addition to that, reporting functions and audit trails are also in place to ensure accountability. Communication with and among 477 police stations located across the country and other agencies has likewise been automated, so that no more lagging takes place when sharing information. The end result is that the processing time has been brought down to 4-5 working days from 15 working days.
With the launching of the Online Application Submission Service as the second phase of this particular project, applicants, irrespective of the fact of whether they are locals or locals living abroad, can now submit their applications online, while paying the administration fee online using either their credit cards or mobile payments.
Further, citizens have also been facilitated to check the current status of the submitted applications online as well.
Addressing the gathering, Doctor Ajith Madurapperuma said, We are excited about the next generation of customer service which is being implemented on this state of the art platform which ICTA has developed. While ensuring that the highest levels of security standards are adhered to, the system is capable of further enhancement to provide digital certificates too. We are happy that the citizens of Sri Lanka will be the ultimate beneficiaries of such online services, which they can now access from their computers or mobile devices from anywhere at any time.
Pujith Jayasundara, Inspector General of Police said that this initiative is an extremely value added service to the Sri Lanka Police which brings about the promise that they are determined to serve the citizens of this country with greater convenience and efficiency.
The Police Clearance Certificate online service is available via following websites of the Sri Lanka Police Official, namely www.police.lk and the Sri Lanka Government official web portal www.gov.lk.

Illegal woodcutters in Mihintale still to be caught
Law enforcement authorities have failed to nab racketeers involved in cutting nearly 100 fully grown teak trees in the Mihintale Forest Reserve and transported out in lorries on the eve of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, residents in the area said.
A resident said the group of about 10 racketeers entered the reserve on April 13 carrying about five chain saws.
They did not alert the police or the forest conservation officials for fear of reprisals by the racketeers since some of them were with fire arms.
The way they behaved led to suspicion that a high level politician or government official was backing the crime, a resident said.
District Wildlife Officer Lalith Gamage when asked said he received information about the incident, and he instructed the beat officer to investigate and submit a report.

The leader of the ITAK and Jaffna district parliamentarian Mavai Senathiraja stated that they are prepared to admit rehabilitated ex-LTTE cadres in to the political stream.
He was speaking at the 40th death anniversary commemoration of founder of the ITAK S.J.V. Chelvanayagam held at Kaluthavalai Cultural hall, Batticaloa organized by the Paddiruppu branch of ITAK recently.
Speaking further he said their proposal to have a Muslim Chief Minister for the Eastern Province was opposed by the Muslims. If the proposal was accepted it would have facilitated the merger of the North and East.
"Following the non violence method of Thanthai Selva, the ITAK is fighting for the rights and privileges of the Tamils in a forceful manner. It is to give a proper place for the Tamils that the ITAK is cooperating with the good governance regime and we are intent on the merger of the North & East," he said.

Lalith Athulathmudali : Brilliant visionary
I remember a school-friends birthday party in our neighbourhood, when Lalith Athulathmudali was seven years old and I was five and a half. It was a fancy dress occasion, and Lalith and I attended it wearing the khaki uniforms of Inspectors of the Ceylon Police. When we were even younger, our parents put us both in blue and white sailor suits for our own birthday parties: those occasions that are always such an integral and important part of childhood, milestones on the way to being grown-up and part of the adult world.
Our relationship extended through our time at Royal Primary School and Royal College and survived the years when academic interests and postgraduate study took us overseas in different directions, Lalith to Oxford and Singapore, myself to London University, and later, to Sydney. Our friendship lasted through to his tragic death in April, 1993.
As a schoolboy at Royal Primary, Lalith William Athulathmudali would sometimes sign his name as Lalith William Samarasekera Athulathmudali. He was very proud of his mothers family name. His father, Don Daniel Athulathmudali, was a former State Councillor who, in the General Election of 1948, contested the Matugama/Agalawatte seat, and lost by a narrow margin to Sam Silva, a stalwart of the socialist LSSP (Lanka Samasamaja Party).
The household, consisting of Laliths parents and their three children (Lalith and two younger siblings, his sister Sujaee and his brother Dayanthe), occupied a house across the street from my own family home in the centre of that part of Deanstone Place which is nearest the grounds of C.M.S. Ladies' College.
The Deanstone Place-Deal Place-Inner Flower Road-Duplication Road-Walukarama Road complex where Lalith and I lived with our families during the 1940s and 1950s is situated in a suburb of the city of Colombo that rejoices in the name of Kollupitiya.
When Lalith was in his mid-teens, the Athulathmudali family moved to Flower Terrace. His father had built a house there on land he had purchased from my father, who had bought it at an auction sale and presented it to Athulathmudali at the same price he had paid for it. Laliths parents, well aware of the value of land, were grateful for this and frequently told me so.
Don Daniel Athulathmudali was a most articulate man. While deeply attached to all three of his children, he was very proud indeed of the achievements of his talented eldest son. Lalith, who was the apple of his fathers eye, could do no wrong and Athulathmudali had great hopes for his future.
Lalith was an exceptionally talented and dedicated student, who, during his years at Royal College, walked away with some of the schools most coveted and prestigious prizes. I saw him distinguish himself year after year at the College prize-givings and among the18 - 20 prizes he won that I remember were the Governor-Generals Prize, the Rajapakse Memorial Prize, the Mackeen Memorial Prize and the B.F. de Silva Memorial Prize. Lalith must surely have established some sort of record, or come very close to one, by this consistent academic performance. Certainly, I know of no one else of my generation who has won so many of the Colleges named prizes, for which competition is extremely keen every year. Inevitably, his success caused a lot of heartburn and silent envy amongst his peers, as well as among others who knew of his talents. This was a burden Lalith had to carry all his life, in other spheres as well, especially that of politics.
While on the subject of Laliths academic brilliance, I must admit that it was not his practice, as the saying goes, to hide his light under a bushel. False modesty was certainly not one of his deficiencies. His nature led him to work hard towards success and to be pleased when success came his way.
We, who admired and respected him, found it perfectly possible to accept this side of his personality, especially since it went hand-in-hand with a most generous acknowledgment of, and pleasure in, the achievements of others. As young boys, he and I became as close as any two friends could get, partly, because we were so near to one another in age. Also, Lalith, being so much older than his younger brother, while I was the only boy in our family of five children, we found friends and interests in common.
Laliths sister Sujaee and his brother Dayanthe are both, talented in their own right. Sujaee became Head Girl at Ladies College and worked as a medical practitioner in Britain, while Dayanthe made his career as an aviation-related engineer and took up the position in Sri Lanka of Director of Civil Aviation, going next to Singapore, where he joined the International Air Transport Association (IATA). He was selected as a Director to design the worlds largest airport in Dubai, then returned to Sri Lanka and is now a consultant.
An important part of Laliths character, and a most unusual one, was his almost complete lack of envy and jealousy. He was very generous in imparting knowledge and sharing ideas. Success came to him easily, for he had a phenomenal memory which helped him greatly. He encouraged me to cultivate this attribute, so that remembering details, figures and dates came easily to me as well. But there was a period in my school life when I was not (in Laliths opinion) studying hard enough, being preoccupied throughout the year with the sports I loved and spending most of my time on the cricket or athletics field. He took on the role of an elder brother, admonished me and put me to work on my books, guiding me with his notes, encouragement and his ideas. As a result, I managed to win a number of subject prizes at Royal College, besides the usual cricket and athletics awards. I knew few boys of our own age who could delight in the success of others as Lalith did, however close they might have been as friends.
His deep interest in the education of young people and his belief in its importance were amply demonstrated later in life when he initiated the Mahapola Scheme for the benefit of Sri Lankas intelligent and gifted youth. His ability to share the joys and pleasures of others in academic achievement was demonstrated annually there, but it was also expressed in a more personal and private way some years ago when, learning that our son and daughter had been awarded memorial prizes at their schools in Sydney, Lalith displayed such spontaneous delight that you might have been forgiven if you had thought these successes had come to his own children. Laliths generosity of mind was a rare quality and in him it marked a true nobility of character.
Lalith was disciplined in mind and body and his friends used to feel that the famous Latin saying of the Roman poet Juvenal, Mens sana in corpore sano (A sound mind in a healthy body) fitted him like a glove. These important habits and characteristics stood him in good stead when he went to Oxford and later, to Harvard University, where he brought great honour and glory to his family name, his old school, his country and also to us who knew him. Having completed his studies and completed his term of contract as Lecturer in Law at the University of Singapore, Lalith returned home and practiced for fifteen years as a barrister in Sri Lanka before bringing to the J.R. Jayewardene government the skills of organisation, vision and discipline he had developed during his extraordinarily talented youth at Royal College.
On joining the UNP government, Lalith was assigned the portfolio of Trade and Shipping. He had initially been offered the Ministry of Lands, including the Mahaweli Ministry, but that offer was then changed due to known reasons: there was money to be made in the tender procedure and contracts in the Mahaweli Project. J.R. Jayewardene was persuaded to give it to another person.
According to the pro-UNP press, the departments that made up the Ministry of Trade and Shipping were those that had virtually brought down the Sirimavo Bandaranaike government. The Marketing Department, the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE), the Insurance Corporation, the Port of Colombo, the Export and Import Control Department and the other departments assigned to Laliths portfolio had caused, it was said, much hardship to the people and colossal waste and loss to the government exchequer. In a space of three years, with an excellent team of proven performers, mainly old Royalists like Harsha Wickremesinghe, Wimal Amarasekera, Chanaka de Silva, Rohan Hapugalle, Lalith de Mel, B.S. Wijeweera and many others, Lalith turned this around. He was the main instrument in the newly-won popularity of the J. R. Jayewardene government maintaining its new broom image.
There were no more food queues, farmers got a fair deal for their produce, the Insurance Corporation was put on an efficient and mercantile-type footing, and the notoriously long queues of ships outside the main port of Colombo, which had earlier been an everyday occurrence, were no longer in evidence once Lalith got going. Although this added to the popularity and credibility of the J. R. Jayewardene government, Laliths contribution and the achievements of his team did not receive the credit that was properly due to them.
It is not merely a lifetime of affection and a valued friendship that lead me to say that Lalith Athulathmudali had the makings of a great leader, since this judgment is backed by a track record of proven achievement. His talent, vision, indefatigable energy, his intelligence and practical organisational capabilities gave him the drive and ambition to help Sri Lanka compare well even with the immense and rather exceptional contribution made by Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore in the 1950s: they could have matched it if only they had been given the chance to do so.
Laliths outstanding ability and vision were embodied in the Mahapola Scheme-a living example of his permanent contribution to the welfare of Sri Lankas youth. He would have been well-advised, however, to turn down J. R. Jayewardenes offer of the Ministry of National Security, a good example of what is called a No-win Situation. If he had crushed Tamil Tiger terrorism, the Tamils and the international media would have criticized him heavily, since he would have had to use drastic military methods in order to do so. If he had lost the war, the UNP and the Sinhalese reaction would have forced J. R. Jayewardene to end his political career. This was not the first time that Lalith misjudged and under-estimated the twin forces of the mighty military and publicity machine of the LTTE.
In my own assessment of Lalith Athulathmudali, looms large his desire to set right some of the wrongs done by J. R. Jayewardene and his government, in which Lalith was an important figure: in particular, his determination to alter the Draconian constitution, which he had previously approved, a constitution that sets the President above the law of the land.
It is in this context, with the full realization of the complications that could ensue, that Lalith Athulathmudali decided to press for the impeachment of President Premadasa. When that effort failed, he founded a new political party (the DUNF) which gathered tremendous momentum just before the Western Provincial Elections of 1993, alarming the government into curtailing his activities and denying him the basic rights enjoyed by any prospective Member of Parliament (which Lalith had now become, after being ousted from his own party, the UNP). Laliths police protection was withdrawn, his telephones were tapped, and his house was subjected to repeated raids by the Department of Inland Revenue (none of which raids turned up any evidence on which the government could prosecute him). No single individual in the history of our country since Independence has been subjected to such an organized, brutal and systematic campaign of intimidation and mud-slinging by the State, backed by the State-controlled media.
In the British Army, the Victoria Cross is awarded for bravery of this sort-unflinching courage in the face of overwhelming odds, and determined and calculated action in the face of immense risk. The Greeks have a beautiful-sounding name for courage resulting from virtue-ARET-which Lalith displayed in abundance when he took on State-run, State-funded and State-controlled thuggery and repression. Laliths heroism, in challenging this monstrous machine, was one of the greatest contributions made by any one in politics in the history of 20th century Sri Lanka. It ranks with the attempts of Keppetipola Dissawe in 1818 to take on the British Government and its military might, in order to free his country of foreign domination.
Finally, on the April 23, 1993, with police protection and surveillance of his political meeting at Kirillapone withdrawn in mysterious and highly suspect circumstances and with the electrical supply to the meeting failing without warning, armed gunmen assassinated Lalith in full view of his political supporters. The fatal bullet penetrated his heart.
And so, with his career sadly cut short, Lalith Athulathmudali joined that small and tragic group of nationalists, thinkers and believers who wanted to change the course of events in their respective countries, but fell foul of reactionary forces that did not want such changes and would not permit them to take place: Abraham Lincoln, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Liaquat Ali Khan, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, Aung San, Martin Luther King, John F. Kennedy, Salvatore Allende, and Benito Ninoy Aquino are among those who paid for their vision, as Lalith did, with their lives.
His vitality, vision and optimism remained with Lalith throughout his life, as did the serious attitude he developed in his early years and maintained during his political career. It was only in his latter years that he would relax and be his normal, vibrant and spontaneous self. He took responsibility seriously and always felt that achievement was the yardstick by which he would be judged in the political arena.
Who would not mourn the passing of such a man With Laliths death, Sri Lanka lost not only one of its greatest sons, but a leader who, with his dynamism and vision, his brilliant eloquence, his energy and his incorruptibility, would have helped alleviate the lot of our people, especially the youth of this country. To them he became a beacon of hope in a land riddled by corruption and torn by hatred and civil war.

Latest addition Donald confident of Lankas chances
Former South African fast bowler Allan Donald, the latest recruitment to the ever increasing support staff that Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is feeding the national team is of the opinion that the Lankan bowling attack has in them what it takes to win the ICC Champions Trophy in England in June.
This Champions Trophy tournament is brutal because if you make a mistake you could be out in the next. I believe this Sri Lankan attack has got what it takes to win this tournament - a lot of skills a lot of leadership with the ball and a lot of leadership within the team, so what is there to scared of asked Donald at his initial media conference held at SLC headquarters yesterday.
SLC has tapped Donald for the tournament to work with the national team for two months to make use of his vast experience of English conditions.
Donald toured England on several occasions in his 12-year career and had a stint with English county Warwickshire as player and coach and was also one time England bowling coach.
Playing in England is a different challenge especially in June where the 2014 experience for me it was very cold. Win the toss and bowl first. The best condition to bat is to bat second, said Donald. But it doesnt really matter to me. The big thing that matters is the attitude towards what you do. You can go to any country in the world and Ive played in the subcontinent a lot. It is how you embrace the conditions you play in, it doesnt matter how you can bowl at 128ks or 150ks the attitude still stays the same.
Adapting to conditions in June using those two white balls properly is going to be absolutely crucial. The lengths has got to be a lot more fuller as the wickets tend to be a touch on the slow side during that time of the year. Playing at the Oval where there is a little bit more bounce and a little bit more carry is going to be good for all the sides. How we hammer those lengths and handle the power play is going to be very crucial. You have to be very patient bowling Test match lengths, a touch fuller and getting people playing, he said.
Working with youngsters
Donald stated that it was not working with the national team but also with those below them that attracted him towards accepting the offer made to him by SLC.
One of my first projects tomorrow is working with emerging young fast bowlers 10-11 of them from 2-4 pm. I will also work with the other fast bowling coaches. Its the grass roots level where we can make a difference, said Donald. For me its an opportunity to work with the international team. It gets the best out of me as coach and also what I can throw on the table with my experience. Thats what attracted me to accept this offer.
Donald stated that its not for him to come to Sri Lanka and take over the Lankan bowling coaching, but more of an inspirational role.
We got bowling coaches in charge and I am looking forward to working with him and Fordie (head coach Graham Ford) and to make sure we do the right things, said Donald.
For me the next couple of weeks are to get to know the squad better, the personalities form, what they need in terms of fast bowling and what their goals are. Ive worked four years with a quality bowling attack in South Africa and still I didnt know where my place was.
For me to understand the individuals and understand very quickly from a personal point of view, tactical point of view and health is what they need. I see my role as an inspirational one, he said.
Fantastic opportunity to coach
Donald said that he was very privileged to be in Sri Lanka and from a coaching capacity a fantastic opportunity to work with a very talented group of players and a coaching group that is going to the UK.
I have been privileged enough to play under Fordie who was national coach for South Africa. I understand how he works and also his patience and his calm way of doing things on and off the field. I am looking forward to this challenge of working with him, said Donald.
Paying a tribute to a former pupil Ford said, Its wonderful to have somebody of Allans caliber involved. The bowlers are very fortunate to have some very good bowling coaches in the system already. They have done a lot of good work and youve seen the progress that the young fast bowling brigade has made. Now for Allan to add his expertise, hes coached a number of international teams, hes coached in the IPL and hes played cricket at the highest level, to have him pass on his knowledge is a huge advantage for our young bowling group and even for the older bowlers.
For me its comforting to know that he is back. I like to see the old young Allan Donald running in and bowling. I am confident that he is going to make a big difference to the group.
SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala said that Donald was brought in to strengthen the resources of the national team towards winning the Champions trophy.
We had lengthy discussions with head coach Graham Ford and head of international cricket Jayantha Dharmadasa and the cricket committee and we were of the view we needed to strengthen every possible angle to secure our national teams performances, said Sumathipala. We are constructively planning to lay our hands on the Champions Trophy, and areas of concern have to be addressed thats why we got someone of Donalds caliber.
Donald will be the third South African in the nine-man resources team announced by SLC yesterday. Ford and Nic Pothas the fielding coach (although he is of Greek origin) are the others.
The Resource team comprises: Asanka Gurusinha  Team Manager, Ranjith Fernando  Tour Manager, Graham Ford  Head Coach, Allan Donald  Consultant Fast Bowling Coach, Nic Pothas  Fielding Coach, Nick Lee  Trainer, Ajantha Wattegama  Physiotherapist, Sriram Somayajula  Analyst, Rohan Priyadharshana  Masseur.

Lovelorn
Sri Lankas national press successfully joined millions and millions of literary enthusiasts around the globe in celebrating the 401st birth and death anniversary of our great bard, playwright and the visionary William Shakespeare. His name is evergreen in our memory because of his vast oeuvre that revolutionized not only the cognitive and aesthetic faculties but also the psycho motor domain of man by taking all men and women onto the vast stage of the world.
All the world a stage;
And all the men and women merely players
It is very interesting when we just imagine that all of us are actors or actresses. We tend to forget all our worries in our diurnal journey of life, if we think that every action done by man is a role of the drama of life on this huge stage. Thus we can forget jealousy, cruelty, unkindness, hate, anger, arrogance, pride, swollen headedness and all the other human foibles by thinking they are parts of our acting, Then the world would become a better place to live in.
Witty utterances
William Shakespeare has offered the world 154 sonnets, 37 dramas and so many other writing and informal witty utterances to his credit. It is said that once our bard had visited a funeral house with his literary contemporaries. Other writers had always willing to be in the company of our great bard because every action and utterance from him had been great literature and a source of real inspiration for them to see the world from a different angle. While they had been in a friendly powwow one of the colleagues had written in a piece of paper about the deceased nothing to mean that at last man comes to nothing and passed it to him . His quick response had been no-thing written on the other side of the same piece of paper. Could any enthusiastic Shakespeare fan help me to trace this historically literary piece of paper I would sell all my belongings and go to any faraway place to buy it. Such a pilgrimage is sweet. Yet, the hungry generation, as our sensuous poet John Keats termed it to refer to his adverse literary critics, branded him as an upstart crow. They were university wits of that era. I feel still hurt. When I peruse through such lines for my literary undertakings, very poignantly tears wet my eyes. We ought to cherish every single letter of this great name to the hilt at any cost. If anyone or any charitable organization could sponsor me to make the most coveted pilgrimage to the literary Mucca , the birth place of our great genius, I would bring them great wealth to keep. In addendum, the writer wishes to express his disgust to the madding crowds who spoil the sanctity of the places of funerals by exhibiting drunken scenes. It is an index of moral decadence. They could follow our great bard and invent something useful to the society.
My concern here is quite different. My attempt during this season of Shakespeare is to explore the possibility of applying one of the most favourite lines of a sonnet to the modern world. The title of this piece of writing is an extract from the sonnet no.138 when my love swears that she is made of truth
A gist of the meaning of the said sonnet would serve me as the springboard for this discussion. At the same time it would facilitate the reader to grasp the quintessence of his writing in this context.
As the very topic or the celebrated first line implies, the speaker makes a direct statement that his lover swears that her love is truthful. That is a sort of assurance. On the part of the sonneteer it is very philosophical because it is the general utterance that women make to fall in love with.
Desires fulfilled
The modern lovers both teenagers and adults exploit this hackneyed utterance to proceed in their romantic endeavours to have their carnal desires fulfilled. It has become a very common scene throughout the length and breadth of the country in every possible nook and cranny both amateur and adult lovers and also paramours embrace and cuddle and even go serious depending on their shared arousal of romantic feelings totally disregarding the public presence. The voluptuous behaviour is witnessed and longed by the onlookers because of human nature. In almost all these scenes, it is never genuine love , but to get their carnal desires satisfied . A railway commuter could see with his or her naked eyes along the coastline, the gravity of the situation. Most of the social surveys and police raids have candidly revealed that most of these lovers are schoolgoers, office workers, paramours of all sorts, university students, rapists, high ranking officers sexually harassing the lower rankers or the hippy type tourists. They seem to swear, yet they give a good slap to the sacred emotion of love, lo and behold! Parents of these young girls and boys might be thinking that their children are learning at tutories . They end as umbrella lovers in the shades of mangroves or dingy places and thus become vulnerable to undesirable social elements.
Our bard tells us in the correct grasping of the matter,
I do believe her, though I know she lies
It is very pertinent to mention it in capital letters as it is a capital punishment to the sacred nature of love. Our bards profound vision is epitomized in the line. Our bard goes onto say that the women might think that the man under her grip is an uneducated man when he believes her . The opposite is correct.
That she might think me some untutord youth
Unlearned in the worlds subtleties
Male lover knowingly all the lies goes on. This is the naked truth at Galle Face Green or Viharamahadevi park or any other rendezvous of their choice.
The ground reality is that the women lover perfectly knows that her lovers best youth is dead and gone. Yet, the frustrated men and women in romance are in a mad rat race of love to get their carnal arrears satisfied very quickly. Lo and behold, a vigilant observer could find very young girls on the lap of very old men , may be for money or prostitution. Any way the trend should be arrested ,otherwise the phenomenon would erupt as the recent mountain of trash. The moral stench in our paradise island would be felt even in Europe. The stink bomb of lovemaking in Sri Lanka!
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
although she knows my days are past the best.
Half of the family strife in the modern society is rooted in this amorous cause. The parents lock horns over their voluptuous behaviour in the very presence of their own growing children at their crucial ages of emotional development according to JEAN PIAGET, the icon of child psychology from France.
Carnal endeavours
Emerging from this devastating truth is another calamitous situation that not everyone pays attention to. In inner mind, both lovers accept that they are lying to each other. To each other they individually credit their lies. Thus they simply suppress the simple truth of lying for carnal endeavours.

## Title: Media freedom, responsibilities and professionalism

Media freedom, responsibilities and professionalism
Sri Lanka, since January 2015 change of government is undergoing significant changes in polity and society. The steps towards establishment of good governance i.e. 19th Amendment, Right to Information Act, establishment of commissions have laid the required foundation for these transformations.
At this crucial time, an onerous responsibility has been placed on media. While all requirements for media freedom are in place now, it is essential to strengthen media professionalism so the media personnel could properly understand how to use the given freedom without abusing it and play its responsible role as a watch dog.
The dynamics of the current transformation requires a sensitivity to the historical moment, a commitment to reporting the truth and an imagination that refuses to be bogged down in the problems of the present. The current process of economic revival, reconciliation and constitutional changes require media to play a larger role, not confined merely to report facts and just inform the public. It has to go beyond facts and incidents to critically and creatively explore avenues for social awareness of reconciliation and economic progress. This may not be saleable like sensational news making, but it is up to journalists to understand their responsibilities.
Post-conflict reconciliation process
Within the context of the present post-conflict reconciliation process in Sri Lanka, it is certainly the role of media to act as watchdogs to report any possible attempts to revive secessionist violent forces and other developments in the country, especially in the North and East, and report it to the public once their factual accuracy has been suitably determined. However, sensitive journalism should not be misconstrued as an attempt to mystify the truth or to hide it. Responsible journalism at the end of the day is nothing more than the practice of good journalism, which is journalism that critically examines and also looks beyond the problems of any given context.
The responsibilities of journalism in post conflict reconciliation process is nothing more than the practice of a journalism that adheres rigidly to a set of ethics and principles that are predicated on professionalism and a commitment to the truth. Truth however has many facets, and any one of them alone is a lie. The media must strive to present facts mindful of a larger context where single incidents are part of a larger whole where individuals and groups are part of a complex matrix that is in constant flux. Hence, the given media freedom must be used with extreme care.
One of the serious problems of Sri Lankan media is the declining standards of professionalism.
Ideally, the news media should serve as a forum in which proponents and opponents are encouraged to express their views in an open and reasoned fashion. First of all, there should be awareness about a potential conflict between the freedom of expression, speech and information and the protection and advancement of the process of reconciliation and development. The question arises, how critical should one be of the process Can one be first with the news and also be impartial, accurate and reliable How can media maintain the balance between transparency of the reconciliation process and the need for confidentiality Can the media meet the imperatives of market forces sensationalism and commercialization To understand and examine these issues, there is requirement of educational debates, seminars and workshops for media personnel. In all this what must not be forgotten is that the media has a very important role to play. The media is a pivotal catalyst in the success of the process of ethnic harmony, reconciliation and sustainable peace as the citizens heavily dependent on the media for information. It is true that absolute media freedom is a myth and in any country one could find some media restrictions, controls, vested interests and manipulations. The problem facing journalists in Sri Lanka is how to protect their freedom when the world around them asks them to follow strategies and ethics which bind them to a certain ideology. The imperatives of journalism, i.e. accuracy, fairness, impartiality and reliability bolstered by the freedom of expression speech and information and open government provide the backbone of democratic pluralism and in Sri Lanka, the media is fortunate to find above conditions are well in place.
Newspaper establishments
The media in Sri Lanka can be broadly placed into two categories- those which are owned and controlled by the State and those which are privately owned and controlled. In addition to the state-owned Lake House, of ANCL, there are five large private establishments that print a number of daily newspapers in national languages, as well as some more private establishments that publish several weekend newspapers. There are few dozens of privately owned establishments of broadcasting and television stations.
Although the conflict ended eight years ago, at least a section of the media in Sri Lanka exacerbates existing communal and ethnic tensions by continuously playing on the nationalist and religious emotions of the people. While it is natural that any media has to keep its language readership in mind it is also the case that impartiality and accuracy suffer as a result of this inherent requirement. Newspaper establishments owned by Sinhalese show a majoritarian bias regardless of their language medium. Similarly, the Tamil media establishments always give a pro Tamil bias. Meanwhile, the Tamil speaking Muslim community also complains that the mainstream Tamil media ignores their concerns.
To rectify the media issues such as professionalism, broad awareness and ability to inform, the institutions as well as the state bodies should chip in with practical steps to train, regular updating and internal review of editing and style handbooks, in-house workshops and training, cooperation between personnel in Colombo and grass roots level correspondents, building the capacity of provincial and grass roots level correspondents and increasing the interaction and last but not the least, the recognition by media organisations of the need for voluntary self-regulation and maintenance of professional standards codes of ethics and conduct.
Nobody can find fault with the media demand that the press complaints commission should be handled by media itself and it should be strengthened to suit present day requirements. However, it should not be done at the cost of the existing Press Council which has served the public as well as media institutions for a long period. Though there were few criticisms about the functioning of the Council, it has not faced any major complaints. Hence, it should be allowed to function without undue interference.
Journalists in Sri Lank have to realize the pivotal importance of the media in the process of strengthening of democracy, reconciliation and economic development. The media must refrain from spewing out half truths, propaganda and poor information and act with responsibility play the role of the watch dog.

Million-dollar Stokes hits maiden T20 century
New Delhi: Rising Pune Supergiant's record-breaking investment in Ben Stokes has paid dividends, with the England allrounder delivering a blistering maiden Twenty20 century to secure his Indian Premier League team a crucial victory.
Stokes -- whose $2.16 million contract broke the IPL signing record for a foreign player -- hit an unbeaten 63-ball 103 during the Supergiant's five-wicket win over the Gujarat Lions on Monday.
"He's done a terrific job for us. We paid a big amount to get him.
We know he's a quality player. (He) certainly earned his cash tonight," Supergiant captain Steve Smith said of their star performer after the win.
The left-handed batsman, who came into bat with Pune precariously placed at 10 for three, put on a 76-run fifth-wicket partnership with Mahendra Singh Dhoni who made 26. Supergiant chased down their 162-run target with a ball to spare to keep in the top half of the league's eight-team ranking. Stokes, who has won three man-of-the-match awards in eight IPL matches this season, smashed seven fours and six sixes in front of a raucous home crowd. AFP

Museum-goers beware: that ancient artifact may be stolen
A few years ago, Christos Tsirogiannis was looking through the Metropolitan Museum of Art's online collection when he had a flash of recognition. While studying an ancient Greek kratera clay vase used for mixing winesomething suddenly clicked, he says. The vase was decorated with a painting of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine. I knew that I had seen the subject on that krater before, he says.
A forensic archaeologist affiliated with the University of Glasgows Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research, Tsirogiannis has access to restricted databases containing tens of thousands of photographs and documents seized during raids. Searching through the online archives, he found five photos of the Mets Greek krater among items confiscated from Giacomo Medici, an Italian antiquities dealer convicted in 2005 of receiving stolen goods and conspiracy to traffic looted antiquities.
So why was an object that may have been dug up and sold by looters on display at a famous American museum, and how did it get there
Uncomfortable questions like these are becoming more common in the digital age as museums, universities, and private collectors publish online catalogs of their collections, creating a valuable resource for anti-looting detectives like Tsirogiannis.
Although his influence is rarely acknowledged, Tsirogianniss sleuthing has spurred major museums and auction houses in the United States, Europe, and Asia to return dozens of treasured objects to their rightful owners in Greece, Italy, and other countries.
I always liked jigsaw puzzles as a kid, the Greek-born researcher says. My work now resembles a gigantic jigsaw puzzle made of thousands of smaller puzzles.
After studying archaeology and art history at the University of Athens, Tsirogiannis worked for the Greek Ministries of Culture and Justice dating and classifying looted artifacts. He earned a doctorate at Cambridge University in 2013, writing his dissertation on international networks of illicit antiquities traders.
With a voluminous visual memory that can call to mind thousands of images of looted artifactsand a willingness to send dozens of emails that are never answeredTsirogiannis is actively researching hundreds of objects from museums around the world.

## Title: The Mystery of the $2.5 Million Rare Book Heist

The Mystery of the $2.5 Million Rare Book Heist
In January, three thieves drilled through the skylight of a building near Heathrow Airport and rappelled 40 feet to the floor, bypassing the security alarms, and making off with around $2.5 million-worth of rare books.
There is a special place saved in the pantheon of art thieves for those who commit their crimes while displaying almost supernatural feats of athletic prowess.
Thieves who climb up walls, through windows, or prowl around raising nary an alarm get nicknames like Spideman and Ghost. They have even inspired their own sub-genre of thrillersthink Catherine Zeta Joness Cirque de Soleil-worthy contortions to steal a valuable mask in Entrapment.
But its Tom Cruises vault heist in Mission: Impossible that is the most apt model when it comes to a recent theft of 160 antique books from a warehouse in London.
Late in the night on Jan. 29, three still-unknown thieves drilled through the skylight of a building near Heathrow Airport and rappelled 40 feet to the floor, bypassing the security alarms.
They went straight to six specific crates that contained three dealers worth of books that were en route to the California International Antiquarian Book Fair in Oakland.
Over the course of several hours, they unloaded the books they wanted into duffel bags, belayed their loot to the roof, and took off in a waiting van. The haul totaled nearly $2.5 million.
Behind these books there is a lot of work because we have to search to try to find out where the books areauction houses, collectors, colleaguesand theres big research behind these books, Alessandro Meda Riquier, one of the affected dealers, tells Sky News. They are not only taking money away from me but also a big part of my job.
Riquier was the owner of several of the most noteworthy tomes that were taken in the heist. The most expensive book was a second edition of Copernicuss On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres from 1566 in which the astronomer introduced his revolutionary theory that the sunnot the Earthis the center of the universe.
That book alone is worth over $250,000. Among the rest of the trove are several rare editions of Dantes Divine Comedy and a smattering of Galileos, Newtons, and da Vincis, among other titles from the luminaries of the early sciences.
All in all, it is the quantity of books stolen rather than the individual titles that make this heist so significant.
The books were there for only a short time in that warehouse, and this is a very exotic commodity so this is not something that the average person thinks that they can sell, Jeremy Norman, a rare book dealer with a specialty in the early sciences, tells The Daily Beast. I think its a real mystery. You really wonder how they knew the stuff was there, and the timing of it, and how they were shipped off, and what the real motivation was.
Several theories have been offered as to why the thieves went after this quarry. One suggests that this may have been a made to order theft, one in which a buyer specifically commissioned the thieves to take these titles.
Similar to fine art, stolen antique books are very difficult to sell on the legitimate marketand thereby net the titles full value. When a rare book crime becomes known, organizations like the Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America (ABAA) quickly take action to alert their members to the volumes that were stolen so dealers can be on the lookout for anyone trying to offload a tainted treasure.
If youre a seller, youre not going to want to touch something that might remotely be even possibly stolen because youre going to lose a lot of face with your customer, Susan Benne, executive director of the ABAA, tells The Daily Beast. She points out that the rare book market deals in a lot of repeat transactions, books that change hands multiple times.
The difficulty of sorting out a stolen book after it has made its way through a few owners ensures that most booksellers are painstakingly principled when it comes to provenance.
Its a real hassle to have to go back through the process of dealing with insurance companies, with law enforcement, Benne says, noting that above and beyond wanting to do the right thing anyway dealing with stolen material in the end isnt worth it for dealers.
While a wealthy collector with a gleam in his eye could have commissioned the theft, the more likely scenario is that it was a crime of opportunity. In this theory, a gang of nefarious local elements had help from someone inside the warehouses operation who tipped them off to the presence of the expensive cargo and the exact details of the books schedule and location.
The shipment was only being stored for a few days, so the opportunity to take the books, not to mention the ability to quickly pick the correct crates out of a room full of other goods that were left untouched, most likely required some help. As Norman says, to coordinate such a thing, this is like in a movie, how would you know
Thank You!

But if this is what happened, the three felons are most likely sitting somewhere scratching their heads right now trying to figure out how to get rid of their ill-begotten library.
Maybe it was tempting to professional thieves who didnt understand that this isnt going to be something that you can fence like jewelry, Norman says. I can tell you its not going to affect the prices of books, and its going to be really hard for these books to be converted to cash if thats what they want to do.
Another member of the community, Chris Marinello, CEO of Art Recovery International, offered The Guardian a more dire warning for what might happen if these thieves find it difficult to cash out.
The books might then be broken up, he says. Some of the illuminated manuscripts and engravings contained therein might be traded in the art market, where many buyers dont know they were cut out of rare books. It becomes a lot more difficult to trace.
The antique book community is no stranger to crime, but the London heist broke the previous mold. Its not uncommon for rare bookstore owners to catch someone slipping a book into their pocketNorman says he dealt with this occasionally at the store he owned for 30 years. And institutions like libraries that have a permanent collection of treasures are not immune to thefts, whether from outsider thieves or by employees or visiting scholars who are looking to make a few extra bucks on the side.
I mean the thefts that have been really disruptive and sort of shocking in our world, a lot of them more recently have come from libraries, Benne says.
As a comparison to the London theft, Norman mentions the 1969 attempt on the Gutenberg Bible at the Widener Library at Harvard.
The amateur thief lowered himself by rope into the room where the Bible was displayed, packed the two volumes up in his backpack, and attempted to scale back up to the roof. Unfortunately, he miscalculated how heavy the tomes actually wereover 60 pounds when carried togetherand he fell to the ground. Needless to say, the crime was thwarted.
But incompetence isnt the only thing that separates the 1969 attempted theft from the 160 books successful stolen in January.
The books in the Harvard Library were there for years. Everybody knew about them, they werent going anywhere, you could target it. That [theft] was daring and it flopped, Norman says. [The London theft] took real skill thats got to be professionals. So now were up against professional thieves, and we could have more trouble than we used to have in the past.

NCCSL welcomes GSP+, Harsha says stepping stone to FTA with EU
The National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) has congratulated the Government for regaining of the GSP plus facility once again.
The GSP plus facility will raise the economy to greater heights with increased exports to EU countries. The opportunities for Sri Lankan economy would expand tremendously for garments, apparel, fishing sector and other sectors as well.
Regaining GSP from the EU will be a big step for the new government which managed to negotiate the removal of the fisheries ban imposed by the EU as well, NCCSL President Sujeeva Samaraweera said.
The EUs Generalized Scheme of Preferences or GSP allows developing countries to pay less or no duties on their exports to the EU and gives them vital access to EU markets and contributes to their economic growth.The scheme will bring benefit to over 66 product categories from Sri Lanka which can enter the EU market.
Meanwhile, Deputy Foreign Minister Harsha De Silva said Sri Lanka needs to make the regaining of GSP+ a foundation to sign an FTA with the EU because the facility will be granted for a few years.
The significance of regaining GSP+ is in making it a stepping stone to enter into an FTA with the EU. I see this as the first step in a two-step process,
Brexit is going to impact our exports, he said adding that that disadvantage will come into effect in another two years , as a result Sri Lanka needs to enter into a new trade agreement with the UK.(IH)

NDB wins Brand Excellence, Social Media Marketing at CMO Golden Globe Awards
NDB formerly known as National Development Bank was a recognized development bank which financed long term investments to many large scale projects.
After many years of spurring development in the country, NDB decided to capitalize on its strong brand equity and expand its services to be a fully-fledged commercial bank in Sri Lanka.
As a result of bringing the NDB brand closer to individuals and society at large, a far-reaching brand involvement was carried out.
With this idea in mind the Bank established a new identity with brand positioning across the Bank both internally and externally.
New brand values were introduced to staff internally and the Bank witnessed employees reliving these values in their day to day work.
The Bank ventured in replacing its brand identity of being a development bank to a Bank that touches lives of individuals, families, communities, society, economy and the nation through a full array of banking services.
To further strengthen its position, NDB launched its brand campaign Our Commitment. Your Success last year.
Today NDB has managed to reach its objective of successfully reaching out and financially empowering Sri Lankans at very personal levels, ranging from large scale corporates to providing working capital to food vendors on Galle Face Green.
As a testament of this success the Bank recently won the award for Brand Excellence within the Banking and Financial Services sector and also won another award for Social Media Marketing at the recently held CMO Golden Globe Brand Excellence Awards in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
Commenting on the receipt of the award, Assistant Vice President Marketing of NDB, Sanjaya Senarath said, We are happy to be recognized for the work done with the Brand last year where we positioned ourselves as a Bank developing individuals, people, society etc. We also introduced our new tag line Our Commitment. Your Success We are also humbly proud of making great strides digitally within a short time of just four years and to be recognized for its innovative and effective use of social media. Such accomplishments with long term orientation have given NDB a significant competitive edge in the local banking sphere while earning international recognition today.
NDBs product offerings also extend to capital and investment banking products, delivered by the Banks subsidiary entities.
The amalgam of commercial banking, investment banking and capital market solutions has earned NDB the reputation of a unique financial group within the country.
With the vision to be the driving force for a financially empowered Sri Lanka, the Bank is committed to create superior shareholder value and to ensure success of all the stakeholders that join the Bank in its success journey.

OPPO to launch another selfie expert F3 with Group Selfie Feature
Global smartphone photography leader OPPO is set to launch another new dual selfie camera smartphone, the OPPO F3, which enables users to snap both great selfie and group selfie shots with ease, thanks to its dual front cameras.
Since the first sale of F3 Plus from April 1st in Sri Lanka, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines and Myanmar, OPPO has been accelerating the group selfie trend across the countries. The new F3 will inherit the dual front camera -- onefor individual selfies, and another wide-angle cameradesigned for group selfies withtwice larger field of view.The F3 will also feature high performance hardware and optimized software to provide smooth user experience and satisfy consumers everyday use.
Say goodbye to the days when it was awkward to fit a large number of people into the frame, or having faces cropped out, or missing out the background in a selfie shot. OPPO aims to make easy to travel and snap selfies without ever to carry a selfie stick around. Leading the selfie revolution and the phone camera industry standards with the recent Selfie Expert F-series, the new F3s excellent group selfie, distortion minimizing features and beautify function will allow users to capture group selfies with an increased fieldofview.
Selfies and group selfies reflect how people, especially the younger generation are socializing and sharing their lives with each other. said Sky Li, OPPO Vice President and Managing Director of International Mobile Business.
The new F3 will be another selfie expert to transform selfies and group selfies to more natural, beautiful, and most importantly, much easier to capture, even when taking with a large group of people.
The F3 launch will kick start a series of group selfie campaigns in Sri Lanka to empower consumers the new group selfie trend, and encourage consumers to celebrate togetherness by taking group selfies. Signs from Sri Lanka is very encouraging which we saw from the pre-order phase of F3 Plus, where Sri Lankans have embraced the new Groupfie trend whole-heartedly. It is only natural from them to realize that they dont need to be stuck with Selfie Sticks anymore and that OPPO will transform any beautiful moment with your friends & oved ones to an exciting cherished capture. said Tom Zou, CEO, OPPO Sri Lanka.
OPPO is devoted to perfecting the selfie camera technology. In 2013, the N1 model pioneered the worlds first rotating camera.
In 2016, the F1 Plus was the first-ever device to sport a 16 megapixel front camera.
Taking one step further, the revolutionary dual selfie front camera F series is taking the standards of camera hardware and selfie photography to new heights.

Plan revealed to reset existing European records
Paris: The European Athletics Council has come up with a radical plan that would wipe out existing European and world records and set a clean slate as part of the fight against doping.
The proposal was adopted during the Council's meeting in Paris over the weekend, and president Svein Arne Hansen admitted it was "revolutionary".
In a nod to the stain that doping has left on athletics, he also said that "performance records that show the limits of human capabilities are one of the great strengths of our sport, but they are meaningless if people don't really believe them".
"It's a radical solution for sure, but those of us who love athletics are tired of the cloud of doubt and innuendo that has hung over our records for too long."
The project proposes that world and European records only be recognised if achieved at approved international events and if the athlete concerned "has been subject to an agreed number of doping control tests in the months leading up to the performance", a statement said.
All records set before a date that has yet to be defined will remain but only on a list of old records.
The plan will be put forward to the council meeting of world governing body the IAAF in August.
IAAF president Sebastian Coe, who attended the Council meeting in Paris, indicated that he was in favour of the proposal.
"I like this because it underlines that we have put into place doping control systems and technology that are more robust and safer than 15 or even 10 years ago," he said. "There will be athletes, current record holders, who will feel that the history we are recalibrating will take something away from them but I think this is a step in the right direction and if organised and structured properly we have a good chance of winning back credibility in this area."
The idea was criticised by two leading Swedish athletes when asked by the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, with European heptathlon record holder Carolina Kluft saying: "Obviously I would find it disgusting if I were deprived of my record when I was completely clean." Patrik Sjoberg, now aged 52 and who set the European high jump record in 1987, complained that the proposal "implied" that all records from 2017 or earlier were set by "doped athletes".
British athletics icon and women's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe tweeted her displeasure as well -- the IAAF have only stored blood and urine samples since 2005 placing her 2003 record at risk.
"I am hurt and do feel this damages my reputation and dignity," said Radcliffe.
"It is a heavy-handed way to wipe out some really suspicious records in a cowardly way by simply sweeping all aside instead of having the guts to take the legal plunge and wipe any record that would be found in a court of law to have been illegally assisted." AFP

President, PM vow unabated development drive
Yet another May Day has come and gone. There is widespread disillusionment in society about the true motive of political parties in hosting rallies ostensibly on behalf of the working class as they seem to have become propaganda exercises for all the main parties. This year, the parties were extra keen to ensure that they had bigger crowds than usual on account of at least two elections (Local Government and Provincial Councils) that ought to be held in due course.
PresidentMaithripala Sirisena.
Picture by Sudath Silva
In fact, one TV station had a rather moving segment in their main news bulletin which featured interviews with people who had to work even on May Day, like the Nattamis in Pettah. They berated the political parties for exploiting the May Day for political gain, saying they would not be compelled to work even on May Day if the workers were truly emancipated. This was one of the most emotional TV news reports I had seen in recent times.
However, for all political parties, May Day is an event that is too good to miss. It helps to show their strength to the electorate and deliver a message to the working class and others that they will take steps, whether in or out of power, to liberate and uplift the entire populace. May Day rallies were held countrywide, but the focus was on the four main ones  SLFP led UPFA at Getambe, Kandy; UNP at Campbell Park, Colombo; Joint Opposition/Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna at Galle Face and JVP at BRC Grounds, Colombo. The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) too held a separate May Day rally, led by Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, who later addressed the UNP May Day rally as well. (His former colleague and present nemesis Udaya Gammanpila was on the JO stage).
Development goals
The SLFP should be commended for taking the May Day to the provinces for two years in a row. Last year, the rally was held at Samanala Grounds, Galle and this year at Getambe Public Grounds near Kandy under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena, who is also the leader of the SLFP. In a scathing speech aimed at his detractors, President Maithripala Sirisena said he would never betray the country or consent to selling its vital resources. He assured that the new Constitution would not do away with Buddhisms foremost status. He said victory was assured at the forthcoming elections as there is a massive peoples movement around the SLFP, which is now giving prominence to the original Hand symbol. This had faded almost into obscurity under the previous regimes which contested under the Betel Leaf symbol of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA).
The UNP showed its might in the traditional home base of Colombo, as supporters from all parts of the country thronged the Campbell Park. Prime Minister and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe took a swipe at former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa for what he called machinations aimed at crippling the Governments development drive. The Prime Minister said the Rajapaksas would have to remain in the political wilderness for decades to come when the Governments development goals are achieved. The Government would go ahead with international collaboration in development programmes, he added.
As usual, the JVP rally that began from S.De. S. Jayasinghe Grounds, Dehiwela, had the best floats and slogans from a political point of view. They also had the most elaborate and complex stage, a feat achieved year after year. JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, while criticizing the Governments lack of vision and penchant for selling State resources however reserved his harshest words for former President Rajapaksa, who he said had no moral right to hold a rally at Galle Face after allowing the Chinese to reclaim and own 600 acres near the Galle Face. He reminded the audience that the former leader also endorsed the sale of the Army headquarters land to the Shangri La Hotels Group. He told the gathering that only the JVP could reverse the present dangerous situation in the country.
Speaking at the May Day rally of the Flower Bud party SLPJP, which for all intents and purposes acts as a cover for the Joint Opposition, former President Rajapaksa said he had successfully faced the challenge of filling the 18-acre Galle Face Green and urged the Government to hold the Local Government and Provincial Council elections. He alleged that the present Government had stopped all the development projects he initiated citing a debt trap. Several speakers including Rajapaksa and Wimal Weerawansa (who made his first major public speech after being released on bail) said the JO cannot and should not wait till 2020 to topple this Government. They did not specify how this could be done democratically, since there is no national election till 2020, other than saying that peoples power was behind them.
While the JO speakers pointed out the crowd size as an indicator of their popularity ahead of the LG Polls, it is rarely an absolute indicator of success at the polls themselves. In other words, crowds do not necessarily translate into votes. When President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga took over three ministries of the then United National Front (UNF) Government while Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was abroad, large crowds gathered at the Bandaranaike International Airport and on both sides of the road to express their solidarity with him. However, the UNF lost the General Election next year (2004). During the 2010 Presidential Election campaign, Common Candidate General Sarath Fonsekas rallies were bursting at the seams, but his opponent, the incumbent President Mahinda Rajapaksa took 57.88 percent of the vote as against 40.15 percent for Fonseka.
Contrasting views were expressed on the National Unity Government and the concept of power sharing in the future, even by speakers on the same stage. While the majority of speakers on both SLFP and UNP platforms called for the formation of either a SLFP or UNP Government as the case may be, a few spoke in favour of continuing the present arrangement even beyond 2020.
Beyond the main parties, there was not much traction at other rallies, though the estate-centred parties did have successful rallies in Hatton and Thalawakelle. Kumar Gunaratnams Frontline Socialist Party (Peratugamis) simply could not match the rival JVP in terms of flair and crowd size. The smaller socialist parties held several low-key rallies and meetings which were sparsely attended.
Death anniversary of President Premadasa
May Day also marked the 24th death anniversary of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who was assassinated by a LTTE suicide bomber on May 1, 1993. President Sirisena, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Minister Sajith Premadasa were present. The day also marked the 126th birth anniversary of pioneering labour leader A.E. Gunasinha, a former Mayor of Colombo known as the father of the labour movement in Sri Lanka who was instrumental in holding Sri Lankas first May Day events in 1933.
All May Day events were held peacefully, in contrast to some other countries including France and Turkey where demonstrators turned violent. The Police deserve a big thank you for working tirelessly to ensure the safety and security of all participants of May Day rallies.
No crossovers materialized during the May Day rallies, although both the SLFP and the JO had expressed confidence earlier that at last a few would change sides. Janaka Bandara Tennakoon, who was displaced as party organiser for Dambulla last week, was seen at the JO rally, but he was always identified with that camp. In addition to Tennakoon, Parliamentarian Lohan Ratwatte (Pathadumbara) and Mahiyangana electorate organiser Anura Vidanagamage were sacked from their posts of electoral organizers. They were known as supporters of the JO. Provincial Councillor W.M. Yasamanna and Dambulla Trade Union president U.R. Dayanandasiri were appointed co-organisers for the Dambulla electorate by President Maithripala Sirisena. Former Pathadumbara Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman W.M. Samaraweera Bandara Welagedara was appointed for the Pathadumbara electorate in place of Ratwatte. The Mahiyangana electorate will be overseen by K.G. Gunawardane.
This serves as a warning to the remaining JO members who still retain their SLFP organiser posts. The Party had earlier warned all SLFP MPs to attend the May Day rally at Getambe. It remains to be seen what kind of action the party will take against the SLFP dissidents including Rajapaksa himself who attended at the JO rally at Galle Face Green. The party did not take any immediate action last year, but a number of JO MPs lost their electoral organiser posts in a similar purge a little while later.
However, the SLFP hierarchy is also acutely aware of the need to unify the party ahead of any national election in 2020, so it may opt not to take any measures which may seem to be too harsh. After all, both sides are aware that any further rift in the SLFP can only benefit the UNP which too has expressed the desire to form its own Government in 2020. Nevertheless, at this stage it is still not clear whether co-habitation will continue or cease after 2020. The next three years will be crucial for deciding whether this unique experiment in local politics can continue in the next decade as well.

The other major issue that cropped up last week was a suggestion to give wider powers to a unit to be established under Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka apparently to ensure industrial peace, essential services and law and order. All newspapers reported that the President had made this suggestion at the weekly Cabinet briefing, based on a statement made by co-Cabinet spokesman Minister Rajitha Senaratne at the weekly Cabinet news briefing. It did not take long for contradictory statements to appear, with Minister S.B. Dissanayake saying the President was only joking. Fonseka himself said he would not be in charge of the military and police even if such a unit is established, but added he would serve in any capacity if it can be beneficial to the Motherland. Minister Senaratne later stood by his original statement and accepted full responsibility.
As expected, the Opposition, especially the JO, cried foul saying the Government was getting ready to clamp down on trade unions and opposition parties. Several Government ministers were quick to recall the killings of Roshen Chanaka, Anthony and Rathupaswala protestors during the previous regime. Senaratne and several other ministers directed their ire at Minister John Seneviratne who was critical of the proposal to bring Fonseka in to address emergency situations. Seneviratne had earlier caused a stir when he said that talks were underway to appoint former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as the second leader of the SLFP. Many SLFP ministers were quick to deny any such move and denounce Seneviratne.
UN Vesak Day celebrations
All arrangements are being finalized to hold the UN Vesak Day celebrations in Sri Lanka from May 10-12. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to grace the opening day events, while the Nepali President is due to attend the closing day events. His visit comes in the wake of the controversy caused by the Trincomalee oil tank farm issue. The Opposition, especially the JO and JVP, have alleged that the Government is trying to sell the facility to India. They speculated that an agreement in this connection would be signed during Prime Minister Wickremesinghe's visit to India failing which, they said the agreement would be signed during Modis visit to Sri Lanka. Both the President and the Prime Minister have categorically rejected these allegations. Vesak is no occasion for politics and we hope that all parties would keep politics away during the Indian PMs visit. After all, Buddhism itself is Indias greatest gift to Sri Lanka.
The Government also scored a major diplomatic victory when an overwhelming majority of European Union MPs defeated a motion to deny GSP Plus benefits to Sri Lanka last week. The Government still has to pass one more hurdle as the European Commission itself will decide whether to restore GSP Plus to Sri Lanka or not by mid month. Judging by the vote in the EU Parliament, Sri Lanka should not experience any problems in this regard. The restoration of GSP Plus will be a major bon to the economy as well as a diplomatic and political victory for the Government.

By the river that flows
Little drops of water make the mighty ocean,' says the poet. Rivers are the ones that carry these drops of water fed by many a tributary which finally ends up in the oceans. Here we remember with reverence the Neranjana Ganga over which Prince Siddhartha sped on a white steed; and the River Jordan where Jesus Christ was baptised by his cousin John the Baptist before it emptied itself into the Dead Sea or Lake Ashphalbite.
The longest river in our country is the Mahaweli. Other long rivers are the Kelani, Kalu, Walawe, Nilwala and also Deduru and Maha Oyas. The waters of Menik ganga refresh many a devotee at Kataragama. All these major rivers begin their journey as little drops of water from a range of mountains where the holy mountain is situated.
The Kelani river winds past many cities and bridges and has the honour to glide past a very revered temple, the Rajamaha Vihara at Kelaniya.
It also meanders past many churches and empties itself into the mighty Indian Ocean overlooking the skyline of the City of Colombo. The river brings back memories. The sand collecting paada boats of the sivupada 'Kelani ganga oru yanawa bala vareng' - and the 10 Academy Award winning film 'Bridge on the River Kwai', that was shot on location at Kitulgala with the Kelani acting as the ill-fated 'Kwai.'
The Mahaweli has been dammed and was the first river to give us water for irrigation and power. She too prides herself in flowing close to the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic in Kandy. She flows into the ocean at Trincomalee after passing under the historic Manampitiya bridge. The curvaceous Kalu Ganga graces past the city of gems, Ratnapura and empties as a delta at Kalutara. The left wing is by a lovely dagoba and bo tree venerated by all motorists who drive down south.
The other wing is by a sandy playground and bathing spot - the Kalido. We cannot forget the four bridges across the delta for the railway and motorists. Can we speak of rivers without our always "crying" gatakimbula residing in our Nilvala ganga The Gangas, Yamuna, the Indus, Brahmaputhra are massive rivers that originate from the snow clad Himalayan range of mountains, from the hair of Shiva.
All cradles of civilisations. River valley civilisations. Millions bathe in these rivers to cleanse themselves from the ravages of sin Jwang Ho, Yangtse Yang and the Pearl rivers in China make China to feed her people and those around her. They have also been cradles of civilisation.
Another river steeped in civilisation, the Nile, begins from Lake Victoria's Ugandan border and falls into the sea in Egypt. Itts the longest river in the world, where Moses was found in the bushes according to the Holy Bible. The river passes ancient history - the pyramids, sphinxes and now provide sustenance to the Egyptians by way of the Aswan Dam. The Tigris and the Euphrates in Euro Asia were responsible for some stupendous civilisations. Each civilisation had its beginning in a river valley.
The Missouri Mississipi is the longest in North America. The proud St. Lawrence river plunges as the Niagara falls dividing herself into the Canadian and American falls. The Amazon is the widest which makes the sea to be murky and muddy for nearly 60 kilometres near its estuary.
The Beautiful Blue Danube gave us Strauss's immortal Blue Danube. River Zambesi plunges as the thundering cloud or the mile long Victoria falls in Zimbawe. River Kereb looks up in awe at her creator - the highest water fall in the world Venezuela's Angel Falls.
Our thoughts go back to the spiritual leaders when we picture the Niger river that fall into the Atlantic Ocean, broken into many tributaries. Gay Paree will lose its lustre without the serene Seine.
The Thames flows by the mother of Parliaments and the Big Ben and also under London Tower Bridge into the pool of London. It is another river with a history. A famous battle was fought at the estuary of the River Plate in Uruguay.
A battle between three destroyers and a German pocket battleship 'The Grof Spree.'Rivers have given man, animals and plants, water and also food. Our very existence depends on these winding paths of water.
They can recite Alfred Lord Tennyson's verse: 'For men may come and men may go, but I go on forever. Should we be spared of man's desecration of nature.' Man, who will one day have to paddle his own canoe in the 'River of No Return .'

Robot RAVE
A team from the department of Computer Science, Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenapura have come up with a cute looking innovative robot. This falls under the category of Social Robotics and, this is the first of its kind in the country. They must have a lot to say.
Robotics has become one of the major spotlight grabbing technologies in the world. Though this technology is fairly new to the Sri Lankan techies, global institutes are coming up with groundbreaking innovations day by day, stirring up the interest of local institutes. Many institutes and personals have taken initiatives to step into this interesting research area.
The Department of Computer Science, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, marking a milestone, is introduced the first ever social robotic platform that is developed in Sri Lanka. The cute looking innovative social robot is specifically designed to capture the natural expressions of children, by interacting with them.
Even though Robotics is a new exposure for Sri Lanka, we have come across several robots in Sri Lankan arena, what makes your robot unique
Yes, the fact that our robot deviates from current robotic technologies, practiced within the country is absolutely true. Generally robots are known for their accuracy, precision, effective, logical decisions making powers, high processing powers, strength etc, which makes them very valuable in fields like constructions, medical, agriculture, financial etc. The main difference is, what we have developed, is a Social Robot. Social Robotics is a fresh field for Sri Lanka as well as for the global arena. Its a trending research area where the researchers are paying more attention currently. Since, using robots in areas of education, entertainment, social services, where social skills are a necessary factor, is very rare and challenging, and it is still a struggling aspect in robotics. And that is how Social robotics came into play. in social robotics we try to mimic a human, the daily routines, behaviors ,reactions in specific situations , the steps or the instruction in following a procedure by a person and the expressions are thoroughly observed, and used as inspiration for the development of a robot. The main objective of social robotics is to minimize the artificial and mechanical behavior of the robot and to give natural feel by embedding more human like behaviors. Achieving these targets of social robotics was our main concern and we have developed a very successful social robot.
This is the maiden robot by your team. Can we have a brief introduction on this
Social robots target three main factors; design, animacy, and anthropomorphism. The design was built up from the scratch by our team, starting from the sketches, following the design patterns, learning the 3D designing technologies and even 3D printing. Providing animacy: make the robot look alive was another one of the major challenges. The target group of this robot is kids, our main objective was to gain the attention of the target group and make them respond to the robot. For this purpose animating technologies played a major role, which were carefully designed considering psychological factors. we observes the target group over period of time, and their behavioral patterns, their reactions were analyzed and used to give more human like behavior (anthropomorphism) to the robot and to increase the familiarity for the target group.
Using the balanced combination of these three concepts we were able to develop the robot successfully resulting in a robot that is capable of recognizing the target group, and adjusting its behaviors according the feedbacks and the reactions.
The concept of the robot is very unorthodox. How did the team come up with this
Undergraduates who follow the Computer Science Special degree at our faculty need to conduct a research in their fourth year. This was the research theme selected by Didula Egodage and team; Thilina Madushanka, Udaka Manawadu and Lakshitha Madushan under the guidance of our mentor, Dr. Ravindra de Silva. By developing and advancing a small concept within about five months, we were able to come up with the first ever Social Robot in Sri Lanka and to be the initiators of the first Ever Social Robotics platform in the country.
Why did you give the name Vidhu-Jaya to this robot
The hardest part other than making the robot was naming it. We were undecided between few suggestions that we received. Since this was the first robot developed by the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, we wanted to make a connection to the university as well. There were several names that are commonly used in the university, which has direct connection to the university. And Vidhu-Jaya, was one of them. We think the name suits him better, it will stand as a symbol, a milestone in Sri Lankan robotic journey.
It must have been really difficult to gather knowledge on a field which was completely new to Sri Lanka, how did the team overcome this challenge
We are extremely privileged to have Dr. Ravindra de Silva as a lecturer of the department and most importantly as our mentor. He has intimate knowledge and firsthand experience on Social Robotics from working at Toyota Japan and Toyohashi University, Japan. If not for him, there wouldnt be a ViduJaya.
Share your experience of working with the team.
We had a considerable basic knowledge when we started off the project. But our main obstacle was finding the required physical resources. Robotics is a fairly new industry in the Sri Lankan market, and it was not easy to find out the necessary resources. We spent days and days browsing through the streets of Pettah to find the required gadgets. But that didnt stop us, our dreams kept us running towards our goals. Dr. Ravindra de Silva was the constant force that powered us.He lent us his personal resources,allowed us to use his personal office space to carry on the project, where we spent uncountable sleepless nights. Our hard work finally paid off, making ViduJaya a milestone in Robotics in Sri Lanka.
Also we need to make a special note on the physical design of ViduJaya, the cute face and the savvy design that you see is a creation of our team, from drawings to, 3D designing to 3D printing. 3D printing was new arena to the country back then. Although our faculty had a 3D printer, we had no idea how to operate it, we had to learn from the scratch, from opening the package to getting an object printed. There were numerous technical difficulties, to which we had to find solutions by ourselves. Now for our team 3D printing has become as easy as taking normal printout.
The journey we had, during the last five months, was not an easy one. There were so many obstacles so many hurdles, but together as a team we were able to overcome them and find solutions to every problem that we faced. All together it was an amazing journey, taught us a lot about teamwork and gave us technical experience which we cannot gain by simply reading a book.
What is the support received from the university
Support extended by the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Sampath Amarathunge was a huge strength for us and also, the dean of the faculty of Applied Science, Prof. Sudantha Liyanage and Head of the department of Computer Science Dr. Ananda Edirisuriya were backing us from the start to the very end. Support extended by academic and non-academic staff of the department and all our beloved friends should be highly admired. And their help and support is what made ViduJaya, a huge success.
What kind of knowledge can a student build up by working in the social robotics
Working in the social robotics arena is not an easy task, because it is defined as a multi-disciplinary area. Social robotics uses engineering, computer science, electronics, social sciences, psychology, mathematics, statistics and much more disciplinaries.
When working in developing research areas, it is very rare to get a visible final product where you can clearly witness the change you have done, but by working on social robotics students get the chance to apply their theoretical knowledge, combining it with their common social knowledge to produce a high quality end product.
What is the future of social robotics
This is our first product, we were at level zero, when we started making ViduJaya. But now we have improved a lot and are more experienced. So we expect to come up with better and more successful products in the future.
And also this is not the end of ViduJaya, it keeps getting better and better everyday, with new suggestions, new ideas and new technologies. Our plan is to make ViduJaya the most sophisticated social robot available in the industry. We are ready to bring more innovative products to the global arena, and make a name for Sri Lanka in the global robotics industry. Keep an eye on us, because the best is yet to come.

Satellite GSAT-09 will help India boost ties with neighbours
The launch on May 5 of GSAT-09, a communication satellite developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), will bring India closer to its neighbours Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bhutan.
The satellite, which weighs 2,230 kg and took almost three years to build, would boost services such as telecommunication, direct-to-home, telemedicine, tele-education and other supporting systems in these countries.
The satellite is also expected to help support their water conservation initiatives, by providing data, forecasting weather and sending alerts on natural disasters.
In June 2014, shortly after he took over as Prime Minister of the country, Narendra Modi asked Isro to develop a satellite that could be dedicated as a gift for South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) nations.
Such a satellite will be helpful in SAARC nations fight against poverty and illiteracy, and in overcoming the challenges to progress in the scientific field, besides opening up opportunities to the youth of SAARC countries, Modi had said, adding that such a satellite will be useful for the development of all SAARC nations, with India playing a key role in the initiative.
However, Pakistan opted out from of this programme chose not to be a beneficiary. Following this, the Indian government changed the name of the vehicle to South Asian Satellite.
With Indias GSAT-09, South Asian countries can also save the investment they would have had to make on developing a communication satellite and launching it. However, they have to make their own ground station to crunch data from the 12 Ku-band transponders in the satellite. India has spent around Rs. 235 crore to develop the space vehicle.
India is the strongest among these countries in the region, since it has developed its own satellite launchers and has placed itself among the elite group of space exploring countries.
While Sri Lanka has its own communication satellites, they were deployed with Chinas help. Bangladesh is developing a satellite with the help of a French firm. Afghanistan could be another beneficiary of the programme.

Selby joins elite in retaining world title
Sheffield: England's Mark Selby successfully defended his world snooker championship on Monday, beating four-time champion John Higgins 18 frames to 15 in a thrilling contest.
The 33-year-old Englishman had trailed 10-4 at one stage but just as he did against Ronnie O'Sullivan in 2014 he fought back to win, becoming only the fourth player in the past 40 years to retain the title.
It was also the third world title in the last four editions for the player fondly known as "The Jester from Leicester".
"I can't believe it, I am still pinching myself now," Selby told the BBC.
"From 10-4 to get to 10-7 yesterday, I was over the moon as I had nothing left. He outplayed me yesterday. Today I came back fresh and was a lot better.
"When I was 10-4 down I was missing everything. I said 'pull something together'. If you lose, you want to at least go down fighting.
"To have three world titles is unbelievable and to be one of only four players to defend it is something I could only dream of."
Selby showed character and grit in the final session when leading 16-14 and ahead in the frame he was judged to have fouled when trying to pull off a snooker behind the black.
Selby contested the foul but after a brief moment of doubt the match official stuck to his original decision and Higgins went on to win it to close the gap to 16-15.
Selby shrugged off what could have been a setback at a pivotal moment in the match to rattle in a break of 131 in the next frame.
"I thought it touched, Jan (Verhaas) said it didn't and I trust him," said Selby later of the referee.
Although Higgins briefly had the upper hand in the next frame all it needed was one error and Selby took full advantage to seal victory with a break of 75. - AFP

Set AC temperature to 26o C
The Power and Energy Ministry is to send circulars to all government offices, instructing them to run their air conditioner temperatures at 26 degrees Celsius, Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
The circular is to be issued as part of the ministrys plans to mitigate the countrys energy crisis. Meanwhile, the ministry will promote the use of solar power generation to mitigate the crises in the long term under its Surya Bala Sangrama programme.
The Surya Bala Sangrama programme is envisioned to establish small scale solar power plants on rooftops of at least one million families in the country making them electricity producers as well as consumers.
It is expected to add 200 MWs to the grid by 2020 and add another 1000 MWs by 2025, said ministry sources.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said moves are underway by the government to conserve energy as the country is stumbling into a major power crisis due to the ongoing drought.
The country is facing its worst drought after 2006, the minister said. We need the support of the public at this hour of need to conserve energy.
We are urging the public to do so with programmes such as Viduli Wasana with plans to give away incentive allowances as well to those citizens who contribute to energy conservation, he said.
The minister appealed to the public to save 25 Mega Watts. He said the extreme heat has threatened to sap the water in the hydro reservoirs. It threatens to prevail for five to six months, he said.
The government has already promised its support to us. We have informed President Maithripala Sirisena about the coming crisis and that we may have to go for quite expensive diesel and coal for power generation, he said.
We have told them that we are not prepared to place the burden on the public, he said.
President Maithripala Sirisena has appointed Sub-Committee to look into the matter. Siyambalapitiya said they submitted their proposals for mitigating the crisis to the Sub-Committee.
Speaking on the Surya Bala Sangrama solar power generation programme, Minister Siyambalapitiya said they have already started the programme in Bakamuna Puwakgaha Ulpatha area with the participation of the President.

Solidarity Games coming over Baku horizon
Baku:Azerbaijan is almost ready for the Islamic Solidarity Games, with the first of the teams due to start arriving on Thursday.
The football competition gets underway next Monday, and Azerbaijan coach Yashar Vahabzade named his 23-man squad for the Group A games against Cameroon, Saudi Arabia and Morocco.
The other side of the draw sees Palestine make another appearance at an international tournament, after their surprise qualification for the 2015 Asian Cup, alongside Oman, Algeria and Turkey.
In the previous two editions to have gone ahead, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia both topped the medals tables as the host nation, so the pressure is on Azerbaijan to deliver.
Former Mongolian champion Bazarragchaa Erdenebat was added to the women's judo team, along with her compatriots Munkhtsedev Ichinkhorloo and Purevsuren Buyankhishig, the team announced on Tuesday.
The biggest coup though was that of Ukrainian Iryna Kindzerska, who won bronze in the under-78kg category at the 2013 European championships and narrowly missed out on a medal at the London 2012 Olympics.
The combat sports will be key to their hopes of following in the footsteps of Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, with many foreign-born athletes harbouring real medal ambitions in judo, karate and wrestling, while the taekwondo team picked up eight medals at the Presidents Cup event in Athens last weekend.
The city itself also had a warm-up with the hosting of a rhythmic gymnastics World Cup event, although the home team did not fare as well as hoped with number one Marina Durunda not taking part.
The 19-year-old will return for the Solidarity Games though, and will compete for a possible four individual gold medals.
For now the focus is on winning plenty of medals in the Games, with 'victory days' planned to celebrate any of the 335 Azerbaijani athletes who manage to strike gold.
But the longer-term goal is clearly to win the rights to host the Olympics, and a top official on Monday said that the country would not give up on that dream.
"I think that it's the dream of the country, and we are on that road," said Azerbaijan Islamic Solidarity Games Operations Committee (AISGOC) corporate director Elchin Safarov.
"We were ready for 2024, but it's the dream and we will go for it. We're not going to stop on this.
"For every Olympic meeting we will give our candidacy for this city." AFP

A thespians gift
From the early sixties to mid seventies, thee Sri Lankan theatre scene saw the entry of quiet a number of plays of Tennessee Williams (1911  1983) being either translated and / or adapted by most Sinhalese playwrights and producers. In 1960, as I remember, my friend and the theatre course director of Ranga Shipla Salika, Dhamma Jagoda, adapted Williams most celebrated play titled as A Streetcar Named Desire, into Sinhala, naming the work as Ves Muhunu.
The local spectators had the chance of seeing a vibrant human experience erupting on the local stage, where two players, Ravindra Randenyia and Roma de Soysawere seen as gripping the audience spellbound. Perhaps the writer, director, Dhamma Jagoda may have been inspired by the two foreign productions of the original play. The original play came to be written and staged in 1947 in the US and in 1949, the same was produced in the UK. The film version was by Elia Kazan, the celebrated writer director.
The original play, in 11 scenes, by Williams rests on three main characters. Here, Stella Kowalski, living with Stanley, her husband in a poor quarter in New Orleans is visited by her sister Blanche Dubois, who is shocked to find Stella in a two-roomed apartment in desperate condition.
The sister tries to sympathise with her, which is not being either approved or liked by the husband, Stanley. On enquiry, she says that she is on leave of absence from the school in which she teaches, in order to recover from a serious nervous exhaustion. But Stanley feels that she lying to get monetary help from them. The dialogues that ensue seem to be packed with hyper sensitivity.
Stanley, driven by inquisitive nature, finds that the sister is dishonest, weak and possibly dismissed from her teaching career. There are quite a number of layers lying below the mere dialogues. Out of the three, each one of them has a painful story. What happens in the end may sound bizarre. Stanley tries to rape Blanche. But in a physical and mental derangement that is depicted, Stanley assaults her. This bears actual mental derangement that leads her to come out with a girlhood experience of her marriage to a homosexual who at a particular moment shoots himself.
The spectator is made to concentrate on many a living condition.
The visiting sister, or the sister-in-law of Stanley, is taken to an asylum. It is said that the title is used symbolically from the public service vehicle in which Blanche travelled the last stage of the journey to her sisters place.
It is heartening to see the appearance of the text of A Streetcar Named Desire in Sinhala by a dramatist of fame, Mahavedage Champa Pushpa Buddhipala. This text for me is translated without changing the tenor of the original title. Titled in as Sinhala as Ashave Veedi Riya, the text had enabled a local production which had gone to the last round of the State Drama Festival. As I have not seen the local theatre production, I cannot comment on it. But may it be said that in comparison with the original text with a mix of American suburban flavour, it may have been an arduous ask in translation.
Buddhipala has overcome some of the barriers of transferring the meanings of the original text by way of notes and comments. This may enable the student of creative communication to feel that transferring the original textual meanings is not at all an easy possible mode of expression. All in all, I recommend the translation as a supplementary text for a wider field of creative writing.
Though quiet a number of plays of Williams is either adapted or translated into Sinhala and theatre production this may be the firs time that the flavour is made to feel as an unamended or abridged text into Sinhala. As such the text of the translation may sand as an independent work of creation. This actually is a Thespian gift in every sense.

Trump and Putin: Syria ceasefire heads leaders' agenda

US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed to press for a ceasefire to halt the war in Syria.
The two spoke by telephone for the first time since the US launched air strikes against Syria nearly a month ago, straining relations.
White House and Kremlin statements suggested a productive conversation.
Other topics discussed included North Korea and the timing of a future face-to-face meeting.
Trump ordered air strikes after a chemical weapons attack blamed on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Russia's ally. The Russians which blamed Syrian rebels for the use of illegal nerve gas.
A White House statement said "President Trump and President Putin agreed that the suffering in Syria has gone on for far too long and that all parties must do all they can to end the violence.
"The conversation was a very good one, and included the discussion of safe, or de-escalation, zones to achieve lasting peace for humanitarian and many other reasons".
The Kremlin statement said the two men had agreed to step up attempts to find ways to strengthen a ceasefire.
"The aim is to create the conditions for the launch for a real resolution process in Syria," it added.
The White House also said Trump and Putin had also spoken about "how best to resolve the very dangerous situation in North Korea".
The secretive communist state's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes have raised tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, with Mr Trump saying last week that a "major, major conflict" was possible.
The Kremlin said: "The dangerous situation on the Korean peninsula was discussed in detail. Vladimir Putin called for restraint and for the level of tension to be reduced."
The two had also discussed having their first face-to-face meeting since Trump was elected on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg in early July, the Kremlin said.

US aims to eliminate IS from Afghanistan this year
US: After dropping a monster bomb on its fighters, then targeting its leader, the US military is looking to destroy the Islamic State groups Afghan branch before battle-hardened reinforcements arrive from Syria and Iraq.
While US and Kabul government forces have mainly been combatting Taliban fighters since 2001, ISs local offshoot -- also known as Islamic State-Khorasan, or ISIS-K -- has a stronghold in eastern Afghanistan.
First emerging in 2015, ISIS-K overran large parts of Nangarhar and Kunar Provinces, near the Pakistan border, but their part in the Afghan conflict had been largely overshadowed by the operations against the Taliban.
Many Americans first heard of ISIS-K last month when the US dropped the Mother Of All Bombs on its Nangarhar bastion -- an aerial munition that the Pentagon said was the biggest non-nuclear weapon it had ever used in combat.
US and Afghan forces then raided a compound last week close to the site of the bombing, with the Pentagon saying it believed it had killed ISIS-Ks leader Abdul Hasib during the operation.
Captain Bill Salvin, spokesman for US Forces-Afghanistan, said the local IS presence peaked at between 2,500 to 3,000 but that defections and recent battlefield losses had reduced their number to a maximum of 800.
We have a very good chance of destroying them in 2017, making it very clear that when the ISIS fighters are destroyed elsewhere around the globe that this is not the place for you to come to plot your attacks, Salvin told AFP.
US-backed fighters also appear to have IS on the ropes in Syria and Iraq, where an operation to wrest back control of the major northern city of Mosul has been ongoing since October.
But both the military and analysts acknowledge there is a danger of IS fighters heading to Afghanistan if they are forced out of Iraq and Syria. Michael OHanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, said that while IS should ultimately be defeated in Afghanistan, the Pentagons timeline may be overly optimistic.
A definitive victory could take a long time due, partly (due) to the proximity of Pakistan as well as the possible flow of fighters from the Middle East as the group loses sanctuaries there, OHanlon told AFP. The Taliban, which first emerged in the mid-1990s in southern Afghanistan, managed to conquer most of the country before its 2001 ouster with the help of a range of foreign jihadists, including Pakistanis, Saudis and Chechens.
Analysts say that as well as Afghans, ISIS-K includes disaffected Pakistani and Uzbek Islamists among its ranks who used to fight for the Taliban. - AFP

What to learn in mobile video
Christian Payne is a photographer who teaches organisations like the BBC, the UN and Al Jazeera how to do in-the-field reporting using mobile phones. He also orders pizza to his train seat.
Last week I was lucky enough to spend some time picking Christians brain about using phones to make professional-looking video. At Fluxx, we use video all the time; for recording interviews and sharing how we work.
Everything Christian said was interesting, but here are some highlights
Keep the camera and your eyes slightly higher than the speaker. Filming from above is more flattering (fewer double chins) and theyll look more alert and engaged if theyre looking slightly upwards.
Study your subjects eyeballs before filming and after editing. They should be perfectly in focus, so you can see tiny sharp spots of reflected light. If theyre soft (because the focus is elsewhere, or the iPhone lens is dirty, or you saved the file at low resolution) it makes it harder to connect with the speaker.
Set the scene: At the start of your video, try to tell the viewer three things: Who is talkingWhere are theyWhy are they here
It doesnt take much to do this: just a shot of the outside of the building or the room theyre in, perhaps a caption.
Framing the speaker: The classic interview technique has the interviewee on one side of the frame, looking across the screen towards the interviewer on the other side of the camera. So the camera is between you and the speaker.
Get as close as you can with the microphone. Recording sound is a battle with the laws of physics. As a general rule, if the microphone is closer to the source, its more likely to pick up a clear recording and less likely to pick up background noise or the acoustics of the room. That said, sticking a microphone under someones nose can make them less relaxed, so its a trade-off.
While filming, maintain eye contact and really react to what the interviewee is saying. You need to stay silent, so express yourself through facial expressions.
When filming several people for one film, try to be consistent. The viewer needs to understand that these people are alike, and part of the same story. Set up a style how large the speaker is in the frame, the camera height in relationship to the eyeline, their placement in the frame<U+200A><U+200A>then stick to it while changing the location and placing them on the left and right of the frame. If several people are filming, send round a couple of stills from the first session so everyone knows what to aim for. This video is a great case study in the different ways to frame people, even though there are no people in it.
That said, being too consistent is weird: Cutting between different people sitting in the same position against the same background from the same angle looks freaky (its the trick Danny Boyle uses here in Shallow Grave).
Clip-on lavalier microphones are almost always a good choice for recording interviews. Christian uses Smartlav+ microphones (here he is testing one). They plug directly into an iPhone (use an official Apple headphone socket adaptor if you have an iPhone 7), with various extension cords and accessories for connecting multiple microphones.
Try to keep vertical lines vertical. Its not always possible, but makes a shot feel more comfortable.
iPhones normally record in mono, but stereo recordings are particularly important for blind people. A clearly recorded stereo conversation can transmit a mass of information about the environment the speakers are in and their location. You need an external microphone to record in stereo on an iPhone; the Shure MV88 is an expensive but good option.
If youre at a conference in a hotel, ask the front desk if you can borrow a room to film an interview. Youd be surprised how often they say yes.

Windies claim late wickets as Pakistan close on 162-3
Bridgetown: West Indies hit back with three wickets in the final hour after a 155-run opening stand as Pakistan reached stumps at 162 for three in reply to the home sides first innings total of 312 on the second day of the second Test at Kensington Oval in Barbados on Monday.
Azhar Ali held firm at one end for an unbeaten 81 in a five-hour vigil after opening partner Ahmed Shehzad rode outrageous moments of luck to contribute 70 in the first-wicket partnership. He resumes on the third morning alongside captain Misbah ul Haq.
Leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo eventually broke through for the home side by having Shehzad caught at slip before adding the prized scalp of Younis Khan for a duck when the veteran pulled a long-hop to Shannon Gabriel at midwicket.
In between those dismissals, Gabriel removed Babar Azam, also without scoring, to a catch off his own bowling. It was no more than the burly fast bowler deserved although his earlier misfortune was compounded by chronic no-ball problems.
Dropped at mid-on by Vishaul Singh just as Pakistan started their reply in the morning session, Shehzad was then ruled LBW off Gabriel when on 21 in the post-lunch period only for the decision to be overturned after television replays determined the delivery to be a no-ball.
Lightning then struck twice for the same man after he was stranded down the pitch and stumped to the bowling of off-spinner Roston Chase on 32, the batsman almost reaching the pavilion when he was summoned by the umpires to return to the crease as the replays again showed the bowler to have transgressed the front crease.
"There was variable bounce out there so it was really difficult to get going, but I have to admit that I had more than my fair share of luck," said Shehzad.
"I can't give enough credit to Azhar for the way he has played and if he can continue on the third day and help give us a lead, then we have a good chance to win this match and the series."
Those lucky moments consolidated what had been Pakistans day until the final hour after they wrapped up the West Indies first innings within an hour of the start.
Mohammad Abbas led the visiting bowlers effort with two more wickets to finish with four for 56, the best figures by a Pakistan fast bowler in Test innings at the venue, bettering Wasim Akrams four for 73 in 1988, as the home team lost their last four wickets for the addition of 26 more runs.
West Indies hopes of pushing towards a total closer to the 400-run mark were dashed within the first nine deliveries of the morning as their first-day heroes, Chase and Jason Holder, were dismissed without any addition to the overnight total of 286 for six.
Holder was the first to go, his late decision to pull away from an Abbas delivery resulting in an inside-edge to wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed. Mohammad Amir then removed Chase, whose 131 was the first Test century by a Barbadian on home soil for 18 years. Drawn forward by a full-length delivery, his indeterminate prod resulted in a thick outside edge for Younis Khan to snare his third catch of the innings at second slip.
Bishoo played in his usual pugnacious manner but Abbas request of his captain for another over reaped immediate rewards when Bishoo lifted an on-drive to Yasir Shah at mid-on. Shah then wrapped up the innings when Alzarri Joseph was bowled missing a heave at a full-toss in the leg-spinners first over of the morning.

Worcestershire sign Aussie off-spinner Lyon
LONDON AFP May2, 2017 Australia off-spinner Nathan Lyon has signed for Worcestershire for the duration of the Champions Trophy, the English county side confirmed on Tuesday.
Lyon -- who has taken 247 wickets in 67 Tests -- replaces pace bowling compatriot John Hastings who will compete in the 50-over tournament from June 1-18.
Nathan has been mainly playing Test cricket for Australia and is available for Worcestershire as he has not been picked for the Champions Trophy, Australia having selected a couple of batting spinners instead, said Director of cricket, Steve Rhodes.
He is the number one international spinner in Australia at the moment and just had recent success in India.
The good thing for Worcestershire supporters is we have replaced a top international with another top international cricketer.
He is a very good replacement. It is a different slant, from a pace bowler to a spin bowler.

EPF will not be invested in secondary bond market
The Central Bank Governor has informed that the Employees Provident Fund is no more invested in the secondary bond market, the JVP North Central Provincial Council member Wasantha Samarasinghe yesterday said.
Samarasinghe, the Chairman of the Voice against Corruption (VAC), said he has been informed as such by Governor Dr. Coomaraswamy, as a reply to several inquiry letters sent to the Central Bank by his organization.
He was testifying before the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue yesterday.
Samarasinghe pointed out the stoppage implies that there indeed has been a misuse of the EPF.
Samarasinghe said the VAC considers it as their responsibility to safe guard the Employees Provident Fund from being misused. He pointed out VAC has exposed losses incurred when the EPF was invested in the Stock Market in 2012 and the attempt to use the EPF money to establish a pension scheme in 2011.
Asked if he is able to provide detailed information on his allegation that the transactions happened on the 27 February 2015, Samarasinghe said he cannot since the Central Bank has not provided him with the necessary information.
Samarasinghe alleged that the Perpetual Treasuries (PVT) Limited (PTL) sold several of its bonds and bills in order to find money to buy the Rs. 10 billion worth treasury bonds issued on February 27, 2015. Samarasinghe alleged these transactions prior to the questioned bond issuance, implies that the bond scam was a well planned one.
Of the Rs.140 billion transactions done by the EPF in 2015 and after, in the secondary bond market transactions, 80 percent of them were done with the PTL, Samarasinghe said.
Legal counsel Chanaka de Silva and Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando objected when Samarasinghe produced a document which is allegedly an internal audit report prepared by the Central Bank. De Silva said the document is incomplete while Fernando PC said it is an illegal document came in to the public domain via an information leakage.
The Senior Additional Soliciter General Dappula de Livera requested the Commission to accept the document as they Attorney Generals panel is to lead evidence based on this report in due course.
A document prepared by a panel of eminent persons working for the VAC on the personal expenses of Former CBSL Governor Arjun Mahendran was produced before the Commission. It was disregarded since the details are irrelevant to the mandate of the Commission.
Samarasinghe is to testify before the Commission today as well.
Speaking to the media after the session for the day was over, Samarasinghe said he is unafraid of the cross examinations to be done by the legal counsels representing the former Governor and the PTL today.

Standards of medical education should be safeguarded
The future generation will blame us if we do not safeguard the standard of the medical education and the safety of patients lives. Therefore, we will not let down our duty, Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Editor Dr. Nalinda Herath said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne showed his mental status on May Day to the entire country by threatening a trade union on workers day, he said. He said the minister showed his mentality to the entire country, but the GMOA will not bow down to his verbal or any other threat.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said they would not stop the surgery halfway and let the patient die. We will continue our struggle until the Government take over the SAITM and offer a scholarly solution. The set of proposals presented to the Government by the GMOA, Deans of all State Medical Faculties of Sri Lanka and the Faculty of Medicine Teachers Associations (FMTAs) simply solve the SAITM issue while doing the justice for its students, he said. 
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said there is no Malaria, and Filaria today not because of the `talking of the Health Minister.
Today Sri Lankas health indicators are among the developed countries because of the dedication and hard work of health professionals.
Today many patients stay on ground in state hospitals without adequate beds while the Health Minister is busy putting advertisements on behalf of a private company, he said.

AG raises preliminary objections
The Attorney General yesterday raised preliminary objections against a Fundamental Rights petition filed by MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara who sought an order to quash the Framework Agreement entered into by the Government of Sri Lanka with two Chinese companies.
When the petition was taken up before Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Anil Goonaratne, Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam appearing for the Sri Lanka Port Authority informed Court that Memorandum of Understandings (MOU) pertaining to the Hambantota harbour had been signed on three occasions in 2007, 2012 and 2014.
ASG Rajaratnam informed Court that these agreements had been signed with Chinese companies while the petitioner Vasudeva Nanayakkara was functioning as a Cabinet Minister and alleged that the petitioner has not disclosed the facts of the case.
The first and second phrases of the Hambantota project were signed in 2012 and 2014. This is a continuous and uninterrupted process from 2007. The petitioner has concealed this fact through his petition and he was a member of the Cabinet at the time the Cabinet Paper was presented, Rajaratnam added.
He further informed Court that the final agreement between the Chinese companies and Government of Sri Lanka is yet to be finalised and thereby the petition cannot be maintained.
The Attorney General moved Court that the petitioner be dismissed for non-disclose of the material facts of the petition arguing that the petitioner does not have locus standi to invoke the Courts jurisdiction. The petition will be taken up for support on May 29.
The petitioner cited members of the Cabinet of Ministers, members of the Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee (referred to as the CANC and also sometimes referred to as the Committee of Secretaries), the Director General of the Department of External Resources of the Ministry of National Polices and Economic Affairs, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited and China Communications Constructions Company as respondents.
The Petitioner states that this petition relates inter alia to the infringement and imminent infringement and continuing infringement of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed in terms of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution, by the arbitrary, capricious, mala fide and illegal and unlawful decision of the respondents to enter into an agreement with the Peoples Republic of China for the promotion of investment in Sri Lanka by Chinese investors and lease and convey and enter into an agreement or in any other manner dispose approximately 15,000 acres of land and/or 50 Square Kilometers.
The petitioner further sought a Declaration that the Framework Agreement dated 08.12.2016 as null and void, and declare that the said agreement has no force of law until the same is approved by Parliament, as required by Article 157 of the Constitution. Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for the petitioner.

All Island Transport Union withdraws from Friday strike
The All Island Transport Union yesterday said it will not join a general strike called by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) slated to happen on Friday.
The GMOA yesterday warned it would launch the countrys largest ever trade union action on Friday with the backing of a majority of state sector trade unions, including those of teachers, nurses and the state run public transport.
All Island Transport Workers' Union General Secretary Sepala Liyanage told the Daily News yesterday that his union will not support a trade union action on Friday, but was supportive of an action against the private medical college in Malabe.
Liyanage said if a private medical college is granted equal status as of a state medical university, it would amount to a degeneration of the state medical education in the country which has garnered a high reputation world-over.
Liyanage said although his union has not decided to join a strike on Friday, it will consider such action in the future if the government does not take action to resolve the dispute regarding the private medical college in Malabe.

Battle against dark forces
People came from all over the world for the tea and an exciting talk with questions from writer Ashok Ferry with Herman Gunaratne about his latest book on curses and black magic, God's Secret Agent, which was launched in huge style on Easter day in the gorgeous setting of Mirissa Hills art gallery and bungalow grounds. Opened by a marching band up the hill and filmed by all the television media stations and this exciting talk was hotly debated afterwards over Handungoda premium teas and home made cinnamon biscuits, which as one group who came from Ireland put it was the most exciting book launch they had ever been to. In fact they can't wait for Herman to do a book tour of Ireand and the UK to discuss why as The Sunday Times put it 'The Demons are out of the bottle."
Truth as we all know is often stranger than fiction and so it is in this world where the devil dupes mankind over and over again into thinking he is god. Herman sets out on a journey over the last year to produce a book on a subject no one really feels comfortable talking about, particularly in the west, as it is one of the last real taboos: curses. This extraordinary book is the true story of a doubting Thomas in the world of Ceylon witchcraft or mumbo jumbo as Herman likes to call it. Only, the mumbo jumbo in this book is very real and is all about bottles, hair, deadly stethoscopes, inhuman screams, bloody goats heads appearing from graveyards, snakes conjured out of thin air, demonic possessions with smatterings of holy water, prayers leading to visions and plenty of digging that would leave even crime writer Agatha Christie shaken to her core.
It is also the story of the power of two great religions, not in collision but working together to take on a whole host of demons that call themselves gods. This is not a new thing for the word demon is derived from the Greek for god and so ultimately it is about the one true God.
Hermans stories in Gods Secret Agent are not limited to the lower echelons of society, where most people think that witchcraft abounds still, simply in the imagination of the poorly educated and ignorant. No, these stories span the entire spectrum of the people of Sri Lanka from top to bottom of the island and go as far as how even a president was cursed during the civil war. It is a fascinating journey about a small band of people travelling through many dark places, both physically and spiritually.
But the main character of the story, besides notorious Galle white tea planter Herman, is the humble exorcist, a man from one great religion casting devils out in the name of another. His story is truly astonishing and one that would be considered too farfetched if it had been made up. Herman is a great storyteller with an even greater story to tell so do stop and talk to him about it if you see him at one of the many festival events. The question is why, do we think, has he left writing this book for his twilight years. Is it because he was afraid of what might happen to him or was it to protect some of the characters in the book still living Maybe it is just that he didnt think anyone would believe him before, or maybe a combination of all three Herman wanted to call the book In the name of God and we agonised over whether to indeed give it that name, for God must have the last word and this debate continues. However, we settled with Gods Secret Agent although we were tempted to call it the God brothers as in some ways the book has Blues Brother energy to it.
The stories are not about conventional religious wisdom; rather they are about evil spirits and good spirits and the war between them with humans as purely the vehicles and supplicants for their motivation. The name is also perhaps more reflective of Sri Lankas current status with witchcraft, where the country on one level, seems to be the Devils playground, some say since being re-named Sri Lanka in 1974. But ultimately the book is about hope and faith and the power of GOD.

## Title: Better handling of bad weather

Better handling of bad weather
When heavy rains fall in the catchment areas of reservoirs, they can cause overflows and floods in the surroundings areas. This is precisely what happened last May at Anuradhapuras Nachchaduwa reservoir when intense rainfall led to extensive flooding that damaged both property and crops.
But flooding can be avoided in these situations, researchers from the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) pointed out, if reliable data on rainfall is collected and distributed to Department of Irrigation officials in a timely and efficient manner.
The locally-made circuit board-1
To this end, IWMI, with financial backing from the UK government and the World Bank, pioneered a low-cost mobile weather station that uses open-source hardware and software to measure rainfall, as well as wind speed and wind direction. The stations can also be modified to measure other variables, such as soil moisture, atmospheric pressure and temperature.
While the Department of Meteorology has the requisite technology to measure rainfall, it lacks the ability to provide hourly rainfall updates to the Irrigation Department. It provides data on rainfall only once per day.
The IWMI weather stations, by contrast, record data on microSD cards every five minutes. If there is little or no rain, the stations will send text messages to Irrigation Department officials or tank managers with rainfall measurements once daily.
But whenever there is significant rainfall in a short period, over 10 millimetres in one hour, the station will immediately send a text message to officials who can then take appropriate measures, such as letting some water out of the reservoir so that the inflowing rainwater does not cause floods.
The water in many tanks throughout the country is used for irrigation and power-generation, so tank managers and officials from the Irrigation Department try to keep the tanks full at all times. The IWMI stations allow these authorities to calculate exactly how much water to release from the tanks before rainwater infiltrates them.
It is difficult, according to Nachchaduwa tank Manager Lasindu Kotawilarachchi, to account for rainfall when you receive only one update per day.
Before we had these stations, it was almost impossible to keep track of how much rain was coming into Nachchaduwa by the hour. This technology has transformed the way we manage the tank. We now know when to release water and approximately how much we should release, he said.
The IWMI weather stations cost between $500 and $750, which makes them an excellent alternative to weather stations certified by the World Meteorology Organization (WMO) that, at $10,000, are quite expensive. On top of the initial cost, the WMO stations must be maintained at significant expense.
But these new, cheaper stations consist of a solar panel, batteries and microcontrollers that send text messages to Irrigation Department officials and upload the rain or wind data to the web. All of the parts can be purchased off the shelf, including the instruments that measure rainfall and wind speed and assembled with minimal training.
Yann Chemin, a Technical Consultant for IWMI, noted that he bought most of the stations components at the Pettah market.
This is a self-sustaining system that functions very well on its own. You only need a little training to be able to operate these stations, said Chemin.
Incorporating open-source technology
A key to the stations low cost is their incorporation of open-source technology, which unlike proprietary computer systems and software, is freely available and may be modified and distributed without incurring fees.
This technology allows those in the field to adjust the weather stations to fit exact specifications. Once trained, officials can use the stations without the help of experts.
We want to build these systems, but we want others to take ownership of them and use and control the data they produce, said David Wiberg, head of Hydro informatics at IWMI.
The feeling of ownership is more important than the technology itself, said Chemin.
The issue of ownership and control of data is especially important, since several countries have turned over the management of their weather records to private corporations.
These arrangements often turn out badly, as Haiti lost 30 years of weather data when a company recently shuttered.
Wiberg also noted that the weather stations are crucial to generating data that experts can use to address problems posed by climate change.
These stations can help solve local, small-scale problems, but they can also be used as part of a larger network that can help scientists gather information on climate change and problems that occur on a global scale.
They are especially important because the scientific community needs more weather data. We have less and less information because old systems are being degraded and are not being replaced. These stations provide a cheap alternative to traditional weather stations and it would be in the scientific communitys interest to adopt approaches to weather data collection like this one, he said.
Because the technology is open-source, IWMI has uploaded the instructions on how to build these weather stations to the web, and several countries have already started building and using the stations in various capacities.
Pakistan is using the stations to monitor rainfall in the Indus river valley so that officials can predict floods and reduce threats to both people and private property.
In Togo, authorities are using the weather stations to monitor water levels in sewers so that they can clean them before significant rainfall comes.
Tanzania, for its part, is using the technology in a similar manner to the Irrigation Department: monitoring water reservoir water levels.
The way forward
Though the technology is already of a very high standard, IWMI is working with engineers at the University of Moratuwa to perfect the weather stations rainfall, wind speed, and wind direction measurement abilities.
Furthermore, a local start-up company, A&T Labs, installs and maintains weather stations using the same technology. Sanasa Development Bank has enlisted A&T to set up a weather station in Batticaloa to establish eligibility for flood and drought insurance.
The Lanka Rainwater Harvesting Forum has set up a number of stations at schools throughout the island and is using them to educate children and to warn of rain-related risks.
We are building a community of practice that will lead to greater cooperation and information-sharing that should, in turn, lead to better responses to risks linked to weather, said Wiberg.
While University of Moratuwa engineers are working on improving the accuracy of the stations measurements, IWMI is working on ironing out some battery power issues that occur with cloudy weather. On top of this, officials from the Coordinating Secretariat for Science Technology and Innovation (COSTI) are looking into creating and maintaining a central repository of weather data generated by the stations.
Last year, IWMI provided training on how to properly use the technology to officials from COSTI, the University of Moratuwa, and the Irrigation Department.
But the main problem that the system is facing is one of institutional practice. It is sometimes difficult to get organizations that have been using the same systems for years to adopt another technology.
Making best use of technology
Having great technology does not mean that people will use it. We are dealing with some challenges in implementation, and chief among those is that a lot of people dont understand what open-source technology is and how it works. We are working on disseminating that information, said Soumya Balasubramanya, a researcher in Environmental Economics at IWMI.
She added that IWMI plans to set up a classroom-style training session that explains open-source technology and how to build and programme the weather stations.
We also want to provide a troubleshooting and maintenance manual so that the local officials can repair and reset the devices if necessary, she said.
But the technology is just one piece of the puzzle. Central to the project is getting all stakeholders to buy in. The Irrigation Department has been very enthusiastic about the project. The Department of Meteorology, conversely, has not attended any meetings on the weather stations.
We have invited the Department of Meteorology to participate in workshops and join in the project, but they have not responded to our offers. We would like to have them on board, said Balasubramanya.
For now, the project is going ahead as planned, as IWMI works with other local stakeholders to perfect the technology and bring it to other areas of the country that could benefit from using the weather stations.

BP profits helped by higher oil prices
The recent increase in oil prices has helped BP to record a healthy profit for the three months to March.
The $1.4bn (1.1bn) profit, on the replacement cost measure, compared with a $485m loss a year earlier.
Oil prices have been about 35% higher in the first three months of 2017 compared with a year earlier, boosting revenue from BPs core oil and gas production division.
BP chief executive Bob Dudley said: Our year has started well.
He added: BP is focused on the disciplined delivery of our plans. First quarter earnings and cash flow were robust.
New projects
Underlying replacement cost profit - the companys preferred measure - was $1.5bn compared with $532m a year ago.
And operating cash flow rose to $4.4bn from $3bn a year earlier
Reported oil and gas production was 5% higher than same period in 2016.
BP held the quarterly dividend at 10 cents. Given the size of BP, the payout is watched closely by investors.
The London-based giant is set to begin eight projects this year - including in Oman and Azerbaijan - the largest number in its history in a year.
Meanwhile, it hopes to add 800,000 barrels a day of new production by the end of the decade. - BBC

Can cracker tightens Liverpools hold on third
Watford: Emre Can scored a sensational overhead bicycle kick as Liverpool galvanised their grip on third place in the Premier League by winning 1-0 at Watford on Monday.
Having seen top-four rivals Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal all drop points on Sunday, Liverpool capitalised thanks to Can's jaw-dropping effort in first-half injury time.
The Germany midfielder's fifth goal of the season took Liverpool three points above fourth-place City, albeit having played a game more, inching Jurgen Klopp's side closer to Champions League qualification.
"The goal was spectacular, of course," Liverpool manager Klopp told Sky Sports. "It was clear we have to work and that is what we did. It won't be easy for anyone to win here.
"We needed a bit of luck, but we worked hard for it."
It was Liverpool's third successive away win and got them back on track after a 2-1 home defeat by Crystal Palace on their previous outing had ended a seven-game unbeaten streak. The only disappointment for the men in red at Vicarage Road was the early departure of playmaker Philippe Coutinho with what Klopp confirmed was a dead leg.
Walter Mazzarri's Watford remain 13th, having been denied a last-gasp equaliser when centre-back Sebastian Prodl's crisp effort thudded against the crossbar.
"We didn't deserve to lose," said Mazzarri.
"Their wonder goal means nothing is going on our side because the first real chance they had, and it wasn't really a chance, they took it."
M'Baye Niang registered an early shot on target for the hosts, but a sleepy start to the game was remarkable more for injuries than penalty-box action.
Coutinho came off second-best in an early collision with recalled Watford defender Adrian Mariappa.
The Brazil international soldiered on until the 13th minute before giving way for Adam Lallana, who came on to make his first appearance after a month out with a groin injury.
Six minutes later Watford were forced into a change of their own when defender Miguel Britos signalled that he was unable to continue, which brought Christian Kabasele into the fray.
Liverpool went close with a couple of efforts from distance, Can extending Heurelho Gomes from range and Lallana rattling the bar with a stunning 20-yard volley after Gomes had punched clear. AFP

Case against Dhammaloka Thera: Order for preliminary objection fixed for June 1

Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe today fixed a date for the order regarding the preliminary objection raised by Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka of Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda over a private plaint filed against him for allegedly using loudspeakers in a manner causing nuisance.
Accordingly, the private plaint filed against Dhammaloka Thera was fixed for June 1.
On December 6, 2016, the Court issued a conditional order preventing Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka from using loudspeakers in a manner causing nuisance at Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda between 5.00 a.m. and 6.00 a.m.
The Court made this order taking into consideration a private plaint filed by six parties including former Minister Milinda Moragoda and the Centre for Environmental Justice alleging that loudspeakers used by Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka at Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda was causing an annoyance and disturbance to the residents.
Through this private plaint, the six complainants sought the Courts jurisdiction to avert noise pollution taking place in the area in terms of the section 98 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The six complainants Gavinda Jayasinghe, Dr. Kalinga Kaluperuma, Diren R. Hallock, Milinda Moragoda, Kamalesh Johnpillai and Centre for Environmental Justice informed Court that they were compelled against their will to listen to the amplified sounds which emanate from the loudspeakers at the Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple.
They said the authorities have turned a blind eye to their complaints made on several occasions.
Senior Counsel Ravindranath Dabare with counsel Sugath Attapattu appeared for the Centre for Environmental Justice.

## Title: Challenging future for media

Challenging future for media
Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.
This is one of the most cherished paragraphs of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the very bedrock of the United Nations. But today, the media is facing a multitude of challenges that can undermine this very concept, from authoritarian regimes to the proliferation of fake news on sites such as Facebook. Journalism today is not what it used to be even five years ago  such is the pace of progress  and not always for the better.
The media landscape is changing fast in Sri Lanka and elsewhere. The first challenge was from web-based media, but now social media have changed the way we consume media to the extent that some people depend primarily on them to get their news fix. This has given rise to the phenomenon of fake news where false news masquerades as real news, fooling social media users. It is very difficult to regulate these contents, though Google and Facebook have started to crack the whip. In the end, the only answer is good journalism that can counter the untruths out there.
Today, journalists the world over will get an opportunity to ponder these challenges on World Press Freedom Day (WPFD), which is aimed at celebrating the fundamental principles of press freedom; assessing the state of press freedom throughout the world; defending the media from attacks on their independence and paying tribute to journalists who have lost their lives in the line of duty. One hundred journalists were killed last year alone and many others were imprisoned. Yes, every journalist is told that no story is worth your life but they will move forward undeterred in the search for truth. Unfortunately, there are many, from Governments to rebel groups, who do not want them to find out the truth.
Releasing their annual Press Freedom Index 2017 on the eve of WPFD, Reporters Sans Frontiers (RSF/Reporters Without Borders) said press freedom has never been as threatened as it is now, in the new post-truth era of fake news, strongmen and propaganda. The Index warned of a tipping point for journalism. Attacks on the media have become commonplace and strongmen are on the rise. We have reached the age of post-truth, propaganda, and suppression of freedoms - especially in democracies, the report said. Media freedom has never been so threatened. Syria, where a bloody war has entered its sixth year, was the deadliest country for journalists, according to the watchdog. RSF Secretary General Christophe Deloire said: The rate at which democracies are approaching the tipping point is alarming for all those who understand that, if media freedom is not secure, then none of the other freedoms can be guaranteed.
This brings us to the WPFD theme for this year  Critical Minds for Critical Times: Medias role in advancing peaceful, just and inclusive societies. This ties in with the UNs Sustainable Development Goal #16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.
The 2017 WPFD is focused on why it is vital to strengthen free and quality journalism to enable the media to effectively contribute to the achievement of SDG 16. Specifically, the media must utilize the interrelationships between freedom of expression, justice for all and the rule of law, peace, and inclusiveness.
This is especially relevant to countries such as Sri Lanka which are emerging from protracted conflicts. The media has a major role to play to promoting peace and reconciliation. Unfortunately, certain media in Sri Lanka are still highly slanted on ethnic and religious lines. This is one challenge that authorities and publishers in Sri Lanka have to address.
In terms of securing press freedom itself, Sri Lanka has made vast strides in a couple of years. It is no secret that pres freedom was at its nadir in Sri Lanka during the years 2005-2014. This period saw the killing of several journalists and abductions and assaults on many others. Following the election of the new Government in 2015, the media regained the freedom it had lost. The Right to Information law, while not specifically aimed at journalists, is another boon for a free press. Investigations are underway into several high profile cases of murders and abductions of journalists, though many feel that the wheels of justice should move faster in these cases.
Despite the visible progress made in terms of media freedom and freedom of expression, Sri Lanka is at 141st place in the RSF Press Freedom Index, (no change from last year) which is certainly not a happy place to be in. (In comparison, Bhutan is at 84, Nepal 100, Maldives 117, Afghanistan 120, India 136, Pakistan 139, Bangladesh 146). The authorities should take any corrective steps that may be necessary to take Sri Lanka to a much higher position in the rankings in 2018.

Presidents witty remark on May Day
In his remarkable speech delivered at the May Day rally held in Getambe, President Maithripala Sirisena made a sharp observation about the prevailing weather. It seems that the historic city of Kandy had experienced rain after a long time. Whenever it rains, it is considered bad or inclement as it disturbs the general human activities. The announcer had also referred to rain as bad weather. He had gone on to say that a massive crowd is present despite the bad weather.
President Sirisena, a true farmer he is, corrected the announcers remark in his speech. How can we refer to rain as something bad, the president quipped, when we had been experiencing weather almost similar to a drought We cannot agree more when president remarked that the SLFP arrived in Kandy with the blessings of rain.
Most of his rivals, especially within the ranks of the SLFP, have quite a lot of things to learn from President Sirisena. We are passing through hard times when the world is plagued with harsh financial conditions and climate change conditions. What matters more is that we should be able to observe all this in a positive light.
I am certain that the hard times will be over soon.
May the rains fall in due season. May there be a rich harvest. May the world prosper. And we do not need to ask the rulers to be righteous. They have already proven their righteousness. Without a righteous ruler, the rains will not come in season, the harvest will be poor and the world will not prosper.

Corporate governance, tackling corruption clear wins for Lanka - Envoy
British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka James Dauris says taking necessary arrangements to prevent bribery and corruption by having a good control framework is critical in doing good business in Sri Lanka.
Noting that corporate governance and tackling corruptions are two clear wins at the national,corporate and the individual level, Dauris pointed out that good corporate governance should matter to every business as it creates trust among shareholders leading to higher shares values while creating confidence among investors thereby making easier for them to source the capital they need for growth.
He was speaking at a seminar,organized by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce recently.
Good governance enhances public image and helps businesses to operate with integrity and more confidence in more markets.
Corporate governance makes business entity an attractive place to work making it easier for employer to recruit , motivate and retain your best employees and effective corporate governance also makes sure that corporate entities are strong enough to stand up , avoid costs and risks of corruption.
According to Dauris, regulators get greater powers to tap bribery and corruption ,Nevertheless,a report released by Transparency International, the global movement against corruption, In 2016 ,Sri Lanka was ranked at 95 out of 176 counties with a poor score of 36 when compared to 2015 when the country was ranked at 83 among 168 countries.
The index ranks countries according to the perceived level of public sector corruption.
