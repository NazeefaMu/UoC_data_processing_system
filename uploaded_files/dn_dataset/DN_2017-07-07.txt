No truth in accusation
Acting Health Services Director General Dr.J.M.W.J.Bandara said that there is no truth in the accusation made in connection with the Health Ministry not collecting and announcing statistics on dengue. The Ministry collects data as usual and also publishes them.
But the doctors, nurses and all the other health staff involved in data collection are very busy with treating dengue patients and taking care of patient management. Therefore, there is a small delay in receiving data from various parts of the country.
According to Health Ministry Dengue Control Unit Community Physician Dr.Preshila Samaraweera, a total of 80,203 dengue patients and 227 deague deaths had been reported from all parts of the country by July 6, Wednesday.

SEC enforcement powers limited
The enforcement powers of both the Securitas Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Sri Lanka Accounting and Auditing Standards Monitoring Board (SLAASMB) are limited, observed international organizations of securities Commissions (IOSCO) in a review.
The survey points out that both have powers to initiate criminal action and, along with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), have some powers to take administrative actions.
None of these authorities can take civil action. Criminal penalties are light by international standards and are not sufficiently dissuasive the survey further observes.
There are very few formal co-operation arrangements between authorities with a role in regulating capital markets and the financial system, although with some, there is significant informal engagement.
The SEC has an MoU in place only with SLAASMB. Formal engagement with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), the Registrar of Companies and Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (ICASL) is limited to ex officio membership of the Commission. There are no formal arrangements with the Attorney-Generals Department or the CSE.
There are also significant shortcomings in the operation of the regulatory framework, The SEC does not currently employ a risk-based approach to supervision.
There is no risk based framework in place to select and prioritize the regulated entities to be inspected nor the frequency or intensity of those inspections.
While the SEC undertakes a fair number of supervisory visits annually, these visits (particularly those for managing companies and investment managers) appear to be compliance audits. Although they do cover risks such as credit and operational risks, they are not sufficiently geared toward developing a holistic picture of the firms weaknesses and risks.
The RT notes the SEC advises it is gearing up to address this recommendation.
Despite steps to improve the quality of the cadre of supervisory staff, who are the public face of the SEC and provide front line contact with the market, scope remains to improve the level of understanding by staff of the entities regulated.
There is a need to develop staff in these areas and, where possible, to ensure new hires are drawn directly from the markets.
There are concerns that although the SEC does follow up on site inspections with a view to identifying deficiencies and issues of non-compliance, it has taken limited regulatory action. The RT notes SECs advice that it is making a concerted effort to raise standards, while remaining sensitive to the circumstances under which regulates operate.
Prosecution of breaches the SEC believes warrant criminal action is severely impeded by slow progress within the Attorney-Generals Department in considering references from the SEC. The SEC relies on the issue of cautions and warnings to deal with behavior it believes fall short of the requirements to establish criminal liability.
The SEC lacks consistency in the expertise and experience of staff at senior management level, in certain critical areas which are necessary in order to deliver on its core responsibilities. This has meant that talented middle level staff members in these areas lack the direction, mentoring and guidance needed to build a strong and effective cadre of regulatory professionals. These resourcing issues at senior management level also mean that the Director-General, and at times the Commission, play a greater role in operational decision making, limiting the time available to them to provide strategic direction to the SEC and to monitor its progress.
Communication and consultation with the regulated population about the SECs strategic direction and its policy positions needs to improve. The regulated population needs, and looks for, clarity and certainty in what the regulator is doing and plans to do.

Super LARC compensation system for those affected by Uma Oya project

The Government will introduce the Super LARC system of compensation to those affected by the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project, said State Minster for Mahaweli Development, Mahinda Amaraweera today.
TheLand Acquisition and Re-settlement Committees (LARCs) wereintroduced in 2013 to decide on compensation for those who were to lose property during road development and railway development projects. 
Those affected thus can appeal to the Super LARC body for higher compensation than normally given by the Valuation Department. 
The government has recognized a total of 52 houses which are not suitable to live in due to the project and they are being granted compensation. We have also given them money to rent houses on a temporary basis until permanent land can be allocated, said Minister Amaraweera. 
The residents had requested land from the Greg Watte in Badulla but the estate company which leases out the land from the government has objected to land being given from there,
That land belongs to the state and no matter the objections, the government will make arrangements to give that land to the people or we will take it back from the company, said the state minister.
Thus far the government he further explained had paid a sum of Rs197.6 million for those in the affected houses and a further Rs 367.9 million as compensation for crop damage, We have also written off their agricultural loans and provided more time to repay their other loans, he said.
An additional Rs 300 million has been released to the Badulla District Secretariat to settle compensation claims, he added.
There have been delays in the Valuation Department as due to shortage of staff and the President has ordered that retired personnel from the Department be used to speed up the process, said the Minister.
The biggest problem now is the shortage of drinking water. This has been a longstanding issue in Bandarawela but because of the project, the situation has worsened. We have allocated Rs 325 million for two separate water schemes to resolve the matter. One is to be complete by the end of the month and the other in the next two months, said Amaraweera.
The President has stressed that these people need to be in a better situation from what they were before the project commenced and we are working to achieve that; no matter the cost, said the Minister.

All crimes, corruption charges investigated methodically - Minister
Whether it is a small crime or large; a crime is a crime and they all have to be investigated properly, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said yesterday. Responding to allegations that police were inactive when tackling large scale corruption in the country, the minister said he respected the rule of law in the country and that he did not interfere with any of the law and order agencies.
This is what the government expects and they are allowed to function independently. But in Cabinet we did agree that there needed to be a better mechanism to follow up on these cases, Minister Ratnayake told the media at Temple Trees yesterday.
Cabinet co-spokesperson, Rajith Senaratne addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing on Wednesday said President Maithripala Sirisena had informed Cabinet that he was disappointed with the progress made by the FCID when investigating cases of large scale corruption and that all thieves would be caught within six months if it was under his purview. The President had added that the FCID only seems to be investigating small crimes while letting the larger crimes slip.
The Cabinet is appointed by the President together with the Prime Minister and it is up to them to change it as they wish. I do not claim any right to this Ministry.I will fulfil whatever responsibility given to me. I am hundred percent certain that I have fulfilled my responsibilities to the best of my abilities and even if I am given another portfolio, I will do my best there. I value my dignity above all,the minister said.
Inspector General Pujith Jayasundera said there are certain things that cannot be revealed when conducting investigations and we cannot reveal details until cases are filed in courts. As the IGP, I can state with responsibility that the relevant investigations are being done according to the law in a methodical way and in an impartial manner, the IGP said.

Asias equity market has further room to run
Clive McDonnell
Equity markets in Asia ex-Japan have had their best start to the year since 2009, rising almost 20% in US dollar terms. China and Korea - our preferred markets  have led the pack, posting gains of 25% and 21% respectively.
A key question for investors is whether this pace of gains can be maintained. To answer this, we need to identify what has driven the gains so far this year, assess the sustainability of these drivers and the potential for new catalysts.
The drivers of Asian market trends in the first half include US dollar weakness, a solid earnings recovery and diminishing chances of implementation of a punitive US import tariff considered by the new administration.
The US dollar has declined almost 6% against its main trading partners from its peak in late 2016. A weaker dollar, besides allowing Asian central banks full control of their monetary policy, is generally supportive for regional asset markets as it results in an increase in capital inflows, boosting demand for stocks and bonds.
The flows have been supported by a strong earnings recovery. Consensus forecasts suggest earnings growth in Asia ex-Japan is likely to increase by 18% this year, following a 1% decline in 2016.
China is leading the earnings recovery. Meanwhile, South Korean equities, for which exports are an important growth driver, have been re-rated by investors amid easing of political risks and reduced likelihood of the implementation of a new system of US import tariff.
Looking ahead, the factors behind the Asian equity rally in the first half are likely to remain in place for the rest of the year - the US dollar may weaken modestly, lead indicators of earnings remain positive and the likelihood of implementation of US import tariff still appears low.
Moreover, there are some new catalysts which could help sustain the rally. These include:
i. A focus on stability in China and the need to engineer a positive wealth effect ahead of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China (NCCPC) in the autumn.
ii. Policy paralysis in Washington, which is actually good news for Asian and global asset markets as it reduces the risk of additional US stimulus at a time when there is little spare capacity in the US economy. A fiscal stimulus in this environment is likely to hasten monetary policy tightening in the US, likely boosting the dollar  which is negative for capital flows into Emerging Markets.
Focusing on China, which is one of our two preferred markets in the region, the recent decision by MSCI, a provider of index data, to include the locally-listed, so-called A shares in its global list of equity market indices is a significant development. Although the short-term impact is likely to be modest, given the weight of the included shares in the MSCI Emerging Market index is a mere 0.7%, looking ahead to 2025, the weight of the A shares could increase to 12%.
We also believe the Chinese government is keen to support a positive wealth effect from rising real estate prices ahead of the NCCPC in autumn. Although efforts to cool real estate markets in Tier 1 and 2 cities may continue, capital appreciation outside these cities is likely to be welcomed by authorities as it helps reduce excess supply of houses and encourages development outside the major cities which are overwhelmed by congestion and pollution and where social services have come under pressure.
Trapped liquidity is the other likely driver of equity markets in China for the rest of the year. Chinese companies have been on an acquisition spree until recently, having spent $246 billion in overseas acquisitions alone in 2016. This is reminiscent of the acquisitions undertaken by Japanese companies prior to the bursting of Japans bubble in the late eighties.
Keen not to repeat the same mistakes, policymakers have withheld approvals for overseas acquisitions this year and pressured banks to reduce the supply of credit granted by their overseas branches to these acquisitive companies. As a result, acquisitions have plummeted 67% in the first four months of this year. We view the tightening of rules on overseas acquisitions as a positive development as it traps liquidity within the domestic economy. In addition, it will help reduce the growth in corporate debt in China, given that most of these acquisitions are debt-financed.
Korea is another of our preferred markets in Asia where we believe there are a number of positive developments that will support equities in the second half. The most significant of these is the decline in political risk following the change in government which has led to an easing of tensions with China. Other supporting factors include reforms aimed at improving shareholder returns and accelerating corporate restructuring.
The decision by the prior Korean government to allow the US to set up the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) missile system to defend Korea in the event of an attack from its northern neighbour resulted in a boycott of Korean goods and department stores in China. Newly-elected President Moon has suspended further deployment of THAAD, which is likely to ease tensions with China and help revive the sale of Korean products there.
Corporate reform is an ongoing theme in Korea and one which is likely to continue under President Moon. Over the past three years, Korean dividend yields have doubled, from an admittedly low 1%, while return on equity has risen from 8% to 11%. Companies are cancelling treasury shares, increasing capital available for distribution to shareholders.
There are similar positive developments around the region, with a growing number of companies focused on increasing shareholder returns through higher dividends, raising return on equity and increasing emphasis on corporate restructuring.
Taken together, we believe there are clear catalysts that may enable markets in Asia ex-Japan, and China and Korea in particular, to post solid returns in the second half and outperform global equity markets.
On the three occasions since 1995 when Asia exJapan posted positive double-digit gains in the first-half period, markets generated an average return of 19% in the second half.

BA cabin crew to stage 14-day strike
British Airways (BA) cabin crew are to stage a further two weeks of strikes, in a long running dispute over pay and benefits.
Mixed-fleet cabin crew, who are paid less than longer standing staff, will walk out for 14 days on 19 July, in a strike called by the Unite union.
The strike will begin three days after the end of the current 16-day strike.
BA said instead of striking, Unite should allow its members to vote on the pay deal reached two months ago.
The union said its members were continuing to campaign for a better pay deal.
Todays announcement of a further escalation, underlines the determination of our members in their fight for better pay and against British Airways bullying behaviour, said Unites national officer, Oliver Richardson.
In its statement BA said: It seems extraordinary that a trade union should ask its members to give up their pay and benefits for virtually the whole of July, trying to target the holidays of hard-working families, rather than give those members a chance to settle the central issue of the dispute.

Best of the Best
MOVING pictures:
In this weekly series, we will focus on 200 greatest movies of all time, from the days of silence in the 1920s to the latest IMAX and Dolby Atmos blockbusters. Each week, we will feature two (or occasionally more) movies, one English (Hollywood, British, Australian) and one foreign language/World Cinema. Both live action and animated movies will be included. This is not a countdown list and there is no particular chronological order either. In other words, these are films that you MUST see before you die, in no particular order.
Almost every film reviewed here is available on DVD and/or Blu Ray, the latter being my preferred format due to the high definition picture and lossless surround sound. (A very small number of films are now available on 4K Ultra HD Blu Ray, which has four times the resolution of a normal Blu Ray). Yes, most of the films are also available online on Amazon Video and Netflix and occasionally even on YouTube, but online simply cannot beat the picture quality, extras and sound/subtitle options available on the physical formats. A description of the DVD or Blu Ray will be given in addition to the film itself and where possible, suggestions on similar films which may not necessarily make our list. Please also make sure that you watch the films through legally available methods. Piracy is a crime.
Today, we will begin with Vertigo and M, two of my favourite movies by two world famous directors  Alfred Hitchcock and Fritz Lang.
M (1931)
This B/W German movie starring Peter Lorre was Fritz Langs first sound film. It too was ahead of its time and its theme resonates with modern audiences really well. The story is riveting to say the least. A child murderer is on the loose in an unnamed German city. The police ask the public for assistance or tips. In the meantime, frustrated by the numerous raids the police have initiated in the city that have affected their business, the local crime bosses decide to take matters into their own hands.
They approach the city beggars organization with an offer - if they help him to capture the murderer, they would be richly rewarded. Soon, the murderer, Franz Beckert (Peter Lorre) is captured and brought in front of this mob. He begs his captors for mercy and asks that they turn him over to the police.
I am not going to reveal the rest - rest assured this is a great movie. After all, it is inspired by a real-life manhunt of a serial killer, Peter Kurten, in Dusseldorf. M is most effective in the manner in which it manipulates the audiences expectations about good and evil, right and wrong, just and unjust. Lorres character is an ordinary man, soft-spoken and gentle. He looks like every other man on the street, yet he is a monster.
If you want to get this on blu ray, two options are available. The first one is a Criterion Collection edition and the other one is from UK-based Eureka Masters of Cinema. I have the latter, though I think extras wise the Criterion fares better.
The Criterion edition features an audio commentary by University of California at Berkeley professor Anton Kaes, author of the BFI Film Classics volume on M, and Harvard University professor of German Eric Rentschler, author of The Ministry of Illusion: Nazi Cinema and Its Afterlife, an English interview with Lang recorded in 1975, a History of M feature and the biggest surprise of all  the (unrestored) English version of M dubbed by the original German cast including Lorre.
You can also select the original French language track. On the Eureka MoC Series, there is a second audio commentary that features Martin Koerber, the supervisor of the 2001 film restoration of M and Peter Bogdanovich, director and author of Fritz Lang in America. Substantial excerpts from Bogdanovichs original 1965 interview recordings with Fritz Lang are included. There is also a short documentary on Lang, who later migrated to the USA and made some very good movies in English.More on that in a later edition.
VERTIGO (1958)
This 1958 Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece starring Hitchcocks favourite leading man James Stewart and Kim Novak (Vera Miles was the directors first choice but she was not available) is now being recognized as the top movie of all time by many experts, displacing Orson Welles Citizen Kane. It is classic Hitchcock  Stewart is a detective who has a fear of heights (acrophobia or vertigo in common parlance) and one of his high-placed friends plots an elaborate scheme to get rid of his wife by using this knowledge to his advantage.
Suffice to say that Novak plays a double game (and a dual role) in this engrossing thriller. Unlike in many other Hitchcock movies, he gives the audience a major spoiler, which Stewart does not know. You must see this movie to fully unravel the ingenious plot.
Vertigo did not fare all too well when it was released. It was way ahead of its time, but today it is widely recognized as a masterpiece. Vertigo is known for its use of colour in different ways, from Saul Bass innovative titles to the dream scenes. Catch this one on Blu Ray  Universals restoration team did a marvellous job here and it looks as if it was shot last year, not 1958. I re-watched this BluRay last week and it simply blew me away.
The BD is stuffed with many extras including a sterling audio commentary by film director William Friedkin, though a previously available commentary by the restoration team has not made the cut. Among the other extras are Partners in Crime: Hitchcocks Collaborations (55 minutes) which focuses on Hitchs collaborations: Saul Bass: Title Champ (opening credits), Edith Head: Dressing the Masters Movies (costumes), Bernard Herrmann: Hitchcocks Maestro (music) and Alma: The Masters Muse (Hitchcocks partnership with his wife). Also look for Hitchcock and Truffaut Interview Excerptsfrom Francois Truffauts 1962 interview sessions with Hitchcock. Also, try to listen to Herrmanns music using the DTS Master Audio lossless soundtrack. For similar movies, try Hitchcocks own Dial M for Murder (available on 3DBluRay), Mulholland Drive (David Lynch, recently restored for a new Blu Ray under Lynchs supervision), Obsession (Brian de Palma) and Basic Instinct (Paul Verhoeven).

Conspirators dream will never come true: President
Those who stole the peoples money, made unlawful profits from state property and committed fraud, corruption and crimes when they were in power, are trying to convince the people that they can come to power again, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
Those attempts which are based on ignoble political conspiracies will never become a reality. The government has implemented programmes to develop the country, he said.
The President was speaking at the ceremony to hand over the deeds of Ranaviru houses, under the Viru Sumithuru programme of the Semata Sevana housing project on Wednesday.
The Viru Sumithuru programme was implemented under the directive of the President and the guidance of Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijeywardena to build 3,650 houses to solve the housing problems of the families of the War Heroes of the Tri-forces, Police and Civil Security Force who sacrificed their lives in the humanitarian operation.
One hundred and ninety two housing deeds were presented to the families of War Heroes.
President Sirisena said the country does not need political conspiracies, but moves forward as a country, building upon the victories achieved by War Heroes through their sacrifices for the independence and the sovereignty of the country.
When the government is committed to building national unity and reconciliation through permanent peace, some opportunist politicians are trying to spread disunity, he said.
All Sri Lankans should get together to defeat those conspiracies, he said.
He said some media institutions try to manipulate peoples opinion. Those institutions are criticising the government that ended the era when journalists were killed, made to disappear and media stations that stood for media freedom were set on fire, he said.

A correct step
The move to amend parliament Standing Orders to change the criteria for the removal of a Chief Justice, Judges of the Supreme Court or the President or Judges of the Court of Appeal would be welcomed by both the legal fraternity and the public in general. The whole country was witness to the charade that passed off as an impeachment of former Chief Justice Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake by a so called Parliamentary Select Committee, specially handpicked to humiliate and heap calumny on the country's first, lady Chief Justice. The honourable members which comprised the Kangaroo Court, read Parliament Select Committee, treated Dr. Bandaranayake in the most undignified and crass manner when she was summoned before it to make her defence, even going so far as to cast aspersions on her personal integrity.
Not stopping at that, goons of government politicians even went to the extent of laying siege near the official residence of the CJ and blared the worst kind indignities that could be hurled at a lady, leave alone the country's first female Chief Justice, over loudspeakers. For the first time in the country's legal history a Supreme Court Judge was hooted at by hooligans hired by the government and blocked by armed police from entering the Court premises when Dr. Bandaranayake arrived at the Temple of Justice to bid her farewells.
All because a judgement she delivered blocked a powerful minister of the ruling family from dipping his hands into the state coffers outside the laid down procedure. The judgement, naturally, evoked the wrath of the very top who did not lose time in ensuring that the country's Chief Justice was removed, post haste, through a manipulated process. Not just that. The ire of the powers that be extended even to the then President of the Court of Appeal who ruled that the removal of the CJ was flawed and calling into the question the whole process. The Judge who was next in line to be appointed to the Supreme Court, needless to say, was overlooked, forcing him into a premature retirement. He died, a sad and disillusioned man, shortly thereafter.
This is why the change in the parliamentary procedure governing the removal of Judges is to be welcomed. According to the amended Standing Orders (SO), a Parliament Select Committee will no longer sit in judgement of the judges. Instead, this task will now be entrusted to a panel of retired Judges, which, no doubt, will go through the whole gamut of the business and ensure that the procedure centred on natural justice, a feature which was observed in the breach in the case of Dr. Bandaranayake. Being one time Judges they could also be relied upon to base their judgement devoid of politics unlike in the case of a Parliament Select Committee comprised of politicians, with government MPs in the majority, that will render the outcome a foregone conclusion.
Under the new SO if a Judge is the subject of an investigation by a panel of inquiry, he or she shall have the right to appear before it and to be heard by such panel of inquiry in person or by representatives and to adduce oral or documentary evidence. In the case of Dr. Bandaranayake, all her representations were summarily thrown aside and instead she was virtually subjected to an inquisition by a group of uneducated and ill bred MPs who descended to the gutter. On the other hand the retired Judges who will form the inquiry panel will have the wherewithal to view things dispassionately and deliver a verdict that would be acceptable to all, if and when sitting Judges ever come before such a panel. The new procedure will also be a safeguard against future Heads of State manipulating the parliamentary process to get rid of a Judge not to his/ her liking. Judges too would take this as a salutary feature and preserve their independence to the hilt, since they can be assured that there will be no blow back as a result of judgements delivered by them offending any panjandrum of the state.
Not that the existing Standing Orders were not carefully thought out by their framers in the past. The fact remains that they came into existence in a different day and age when parliamentarians were a more cultured and educated lot who deserved the prefix honourable. These men and women, no doubt, would have been well capable of deciding the pros and cons of a case before them on their merits alone and could not have been swayed by parochial politics. What is more, their judgement on the matter would never have been called into question.
But times have changed and parliament today is not what it was several decades ago, with many of our MPs lacking in grey matter to make independent judgements, what with a whole crop of them not even passing their O/Ls and naturally given to uncouth behaviour. This was what we saw during the trial of former Chief Justice Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake where the Select Committee acted as judge, jury and executioner.

Disappearance Bill to be taken up in House after further study
The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill will be taken up in Parliament later as it has to be further studied and discussed, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
The Minister said that President Maithripala Sirisena has pointed out at the Government Parliamentarians Group Meeting that the Act should be further studied prior to being presented in Parliament.
Therefore, with the consent of both the Prime Minister and the President, the Act was not taken up in Parliament as scheduled on Tuesday.
The Minister made these remarks while addressing the SLFP weekly media briefing at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
He said that 93 countries have signed International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill todate but the most powerful countries are yet to sign it. Of the 93 countries, only 53 countries have ratified it. Of the South Asian countries, only Sri Lanka, India and the Maldives have signed this convention with only Sri Lanka ratifying it.
Asked when the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill was signed and ratified by Sri Lanka, the minister said that it was signed on December 10, 2015 and ratified by the national unity Government on May 25, 2016.
Most countries including several powerful nations have not signed this convention yet.Considering this situation, President Sirisena pointed out that this should be further studied and discussed before being presented in Parliament
He said that Sri Lanka has accepted 27 conditions of the European Union for receiving GSP Plus concessions, which were accepted by the country during the former regime.
However, generally those international conventions will come into effect with the legislative measures taken by the Parliament of the particular country.
Asked whether the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill is going to be brought forward aiming to harass Security Forces personnel, the Minister said that there is no truth in that as the Government has mentioned that no one will be allowed to harass the Security Forces personnel.
Minister Samarasinghe added that it can be observed that the country had entered in to international conventions in the past without clearly studying them.
Speaking on the SAITM issue, he said that President Maithripala Sirisena has had many official and non-official discussions with the GMOA and the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) aiming to bring an acceptable solution to all sectors.

## Title: Dramatic Pride

Dramatic Pride
Drama is at a high standard at St. Josephs College. The reason for this is that these boys are always looking to surpass their previous achievements. Dramatic Moves features the St. Josephs Drama Society for whom no challenge is unachievable. They are equal to anything.
Teacher in Charge Camilta Perera feels that drama is the intelligent choice.
Drama is a great opportunity for these children. It encourages them to resolve conflict and consider alternative perspectives and recognize the varying roles and responsibilities that individuals have in our society. Allowing children to get involved in drama is a wise choice. It helps them to raise their self esteem and develop character. It helps them to develop critical thinking skills. It helps them to develop social skills and talents. They learn firsthand the importance of team work, responsibility, commitment and hard work.
Children use drama to explore their own thoughts and feelings. It is very important for their emotional and social development as well. Drama can prepare a young person for life in ways that go beyond the academics, said Perera.
Team Spirit
Actor Leeth Bonveev Meth Singhage, feels that at St. Josephs there definitely is talent.
Well, we have a lot of born actors and a bunch of very talented kids. And what St. Josephs drama has done is, they have molded it up and made it something much more than just a school drama society. St. Josephs College has stage dramas that is of national and international levels
During this years inter house drama competition I saw many talented juniors who would no doubt be the future of Joes drama, said Singhage.
Drama makes an individual a different individual says Singhage.
It shows us what is acceptable and what is not. It definitely gets us ready to face the society and another important factor is that it helps us destroy that little stage-fright, stated Singhage.
I have approximately acted in just six dramas out of which three are public shows. I first took part in The Mousetrap by Cold theatre 7.
Then I took part in the Joes Inter-house Drama comp. where I was awarded the Best supporting actor.
I played Lucius in Julius Caesar for the Shakespeare Drama comp.
And the same year I acted as Peter Pan in Peter pan the musical- a grand production organized by St. Josephs college together with Cold Theatre 7 and St. Bridgets convent.
After that I also acted in the Tempest playing Ariel. I guess it is quite an achievement the fact that I did all this in just two years of drama experience!
I think Peter pan the musical has been the best production done by Joes yet and Its definitely one production that will never be forgotten, informed Singhage.
Each and every drama competition/ production by SJC has been organized at a grand level. It was through a lot of struggle that this was accomplished. School did give priority for drama mainly because of the societys hard work and pressure. St. Josephs College is no doubt a school which is right at the top when considering drama. There is a pretty tight competition out there but Joes is always up for the race. Joes drama is open to anyone and everyone. This is what makes everyone at SJC join and continue with drama, explained Singhage.
When getting into the skin of a character for Singhage it takes a lot of thinking rather than character exercises. Once Ive gotten into the right character and mood its easy for me to click in and out of it. I have never done a female role. But Im pretty confident that I will be able to nail it if I ever get the chance because its still just stepping into that persons shoe, feels Singhage.
The biggest strength of Joes drama is that team spirit which is extraordinary. With each drama comes a new family.
Joes drama started kicking again in the year 2015 with the inaugural inter-house Drama comp. There onwards up until now Joes drama has been developing. My parents have always been the key to my success. Even in drama, my dad has been very helpful but right now he wants me to temporarily stop dramas till Im done with O/Ls, said Singhage.
Ups and Downs
President of the English Literary Union, Dilushka de Mel stated that the fact that they have a group of dedicated members who give their 200% and the old Josephians who are ever ready to support them is a huge strength.
Through drama Ive learnt to balance all my work so that I wouldnt lose out on either my education or any other activity, which would be very useful once I go into the cooperate world, said de Mel.
De Mel believes that St. Josephs College Drama is definitely one of the best and continuously keeps improving each year, saying that the mere fact that he has been taking part in dramas within college from grade 9 is an achievement to him.
I think Peter Pan the musical, would be one of the most unforgettable dramas Ive taken part in. Then again practices with the Shakespeare cast of 2016 were definitely an adventure of a lifetime. Seeing the talent and potential in my juniors I see a really good future in Josephian Drama, stated De Mel.
He feels that the only issue that drama has faced in the past few years is the fact that parents tend to be reluctant to send their kids for late night practices.
I see a talented group of young up and coming actors from St. Josephs College who would keep the schools flag up high. The drama circuit is extremely competitive. Each and every school gives everything that theyve got to get the title Champions of the Annual Inter School Shakespeare Drama Competition so its each school for its self, pointed out de Mel.
Being the catholic boys school, St. Josephs College Drama has many restrictions when it comes to the dramas they do, due to reason such as the age differences between the actors.
However we have done everything possible within the past five years whether it be a comedy, tragedy or a major production. Its with pride that I say that most of the students doing drama manage to balance drama with their educational activities, and get extremely good results at all the examinations whether it be simple as a mid- term test or even Advanced Level, added De Mel.
De Mel feels that every student should do at least one drama while in college, since theres a lot that you can learn through drama. It helps definitely once you leave the safety of your parents. When it comes to getting into the skin of a character, at first it was hard, but as you keep performing you tend to get a thing for the character, and once you crack the character and understand it totally, the character becomes a part of you - all your character traits and mannerisms. You start becoming a part of the character. So you could say that it depends on how experienced and how well you understand your character, explained de Mel.
De Mel feels that portraying female roles is a challenge.
Its definitely harder to portray a female than a male, especially since females should be portrayed in a way that it wouldnt make the audience laugh. However it depends on the actor and his experience and abilities, informed De Mel.
Although the cast starts off as complete strangers, towards the end of the production the entire cast becomes one huge family.
All the Pettah runs, Koththu nights, Sleepovers at school and cast parties, all of this are what separate Josephian drama from the ordinary school drama society. This is something truly amazing and is the main reason why most of us continue to be a part of Josephian drama, explained De Mel. Josephian Drama has definitely has had its ups and downs.We just came out of a dark era where Josephian Drama was almost on the verge of fading away, because of the scarcity of talented actors. However, we managed to overcome that challenge and come back stronger than ever, said De Mel.
Extremely understanding
Actor, Melanctha Cruse feels that sacrifices are a key factor for their success.
I think that our drama society possesses many talented actors that have unique capabilities and we have very supportive seniors and old boys that always come and invest their time to improve our performances. Ive learnt that in order to achieve something that you really want to, you have to be extremely dedicated and willing to sacrifice, said Cruse.
The pool of actors has a unique set of skills and certain actors specialize in distinctive type of roles. Overall the society consists of a very talented group. Drama is way more than what people see on stage. There is a lot that happens in order to prepare for a production. It teaches you the skills you need when you go out into society, stated Cruse.
Shakespeare 2015 was a milestone for the boys.
Personally, winning the Shakespeare drama competition in 2015 was my biggest achievement, because we didnt get through the semi- finals in 2014. I thought I wont be able to be a part of a cast that won the competition before leaving school. Apart from that, I would consider helping my house win the Inter house drama competition for three consecutive years as my achievement. The Shakespeare drama competition in 2015, we performed an extract from King Lear.It would definitely do down in the history of college because we won the Shakespeare drama competition after a drought of 10 years, explained Cruse. Looking at the current juniors and the boys that have just started to be a part of their productions, Cruse feels that college drama is in good hands.
In the past few years it was difficult to get people to take part in productions and numbers were considerably low, but this changed with the evolution of the Inter house drama competition. I think the seniors and the old boys put in a lot of work in order to help the juniors prosper. The inter house drama competition provided the juniors the opportunity to play lead roles and give them the required exposure to develop, pointed out Cruse. The directors and seniors are extremely understanding.
They make an effort to work around our schedule and this helps us balance our studies, sports and extra- curricular activities, said Cruse.
Drama, Cruse feels is an amazing experience.
Its one of those things that an individual really doesnt know until he or she actually tries it. Its an amazing experience, the practice hours, the challenges, getting to really know your cast and theres so much more to it. I think that if youre a part of a school that does regular productions, you have to take part in at least one just for the experience, shared Cruse.When stepping into the shoes of a character Cruse feels that it isnt easy but at the same time it isnt the hardest thing to do.
You have to use your creativity and create a story for your character and really look at the tiny details of your character and your characters motive. There are certain characterization exercises that we do in order to help us improve.
Personally, it was tough. The first time I played a female role was in 2015, and initially there was so much that I didnt know.
Gradually, with the help of my directors and a few of my fellow actors I was able to pull it off. Looking back at it now I really appreciate the directors decision to make me portray a female because I didnt know that I was capable of playing such a role, pointed out Cruse.

Pakistani Acting High Commissioner Dr. Sarfraz Ahmed Khan Sipra said that Sri Lanka-Pakistan friendship is very important and explained the potential for the development of trade between the two countries.
Pakistan High Commission Commercial Secretary Adnan Younis Lodhi said that the progress of the FTA is now stagnated and that there is a need to agree on a deeper FTA with more product coverage along with Services and Investment chapters if we wish to see faster growth in economic relations.
He also announced that Sri Lanka has been granted the 'Guest Country' status at the Expo Pakistan exhibition to be held in Karachi in November 2017. This is the first occasion that Pakistan recognized a foreign country as Guest Country' and this was granted to Sri Lanka under the MOU between EDB and Trade Development Authority in Pakistan.
Department of Commerce Deputy Director G.L. Gnanatheva provided detailed information on the PSFTA, its utilization and trends in consumer behavior of Pakistan towards our main exports of betel leaves, tea, etc.
Pakistan-Sri Lanka Business Council President Rohitha Thilakaratne stressed the need of visits of regular trade delegations and exhibitions in order to create a stronger relationship between the two countries business communities. Sri Lanka-Pakistan Friendship, Trade and Investment Association President Ifthikhar Aziz also shared the experiences of working with Pakistan business community and the opportunities available for Sri Lankan companies in Pakistan.
Exports to Pakistan was less than 1% of Sri Lankas total exports to the world. Sri Lanka needs to increase exports and expand production facilities where there is potential for trade.
In addition to the present exports, electronic and electrical components, value-added rubber products, porcelain products, paper products, processed food gems and jewellery can be identified as potential products for exports to Pakistan.
There are products for which there is high demand in Pakistan and adequate production in Sri Lanka, but less tariff concessions under the FTA. Therefore, it is necessary to develop strategies to explore opportunities in the Pakistan market for these products.
The PSFTA came into force on June 12, 2005. Pakistan implemented its final phasing out commitment and Sri Lanka has now duty free market access for more than 4,500 products. Approximately over 7,000 Certificates of Origin are issued annually under the PSFTA for Sri Lankan companies.
Sri Lankas export to Pakistan which was US$ 43 million in 2005 has marginally increased to US$ 64 milion in 2016. However, Sri Lankas imports from Pakistan which was US$ 116 million in 2005 has increased to US$ 281 million in 2010, US$ 297 million in 2015 and US$ 304 million in 2016 with an average growth of 9% during 2005-2016 period (Source: Sri Lanka Customs).
The major export products to Pakistan are tea, betel leaves, coconut, wood charcoal and pepper of the genus piper. Sri Lankas export product basket needs to be diversified to Pakistan as Sri Lankas main exports products in primary form are earning lower value export value. Only a few new products entered the Pakistan market including paper products and finished rubber products.
During the seminar, Sri Lankan companies of the herbal cosmetic sector, fisheries sector, aquarium fish sector and tea and rubber and tyre sectors raised their concerns mainly in the areas of FTA concessions, market access and the potential in the Pakistan market for their products.
Sri Lanka is aiming to achieve export earnings of US$ 20 million in 2020. To reach this target, the PSFTA should be exploited strategically considering that Pakistan being the 2nd largest economy in South Asia.

## Title: Freedom of Speech Vs Right to Privacy
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, July 7, 2017 - 01:00
Freedom of Speech Vs Right to Privacy
British Celebrity Chef Gordon Ramsays father-in-law Christopher Hutcheson claimed an injunction against newspapers published by News Group Newspapers Ltd. The objective of the injunction was to restrain newspapers publishing details of a second family maintained by him. The High Court has refused to grant the injunction to him.
The Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the High Court. The case officially is known as Hutcheson v News Group Newspapers Ltd. [2011]. In this case, the Court has made a balance between freedom of expression and right to privacy by giving importance to the fact that the claimant used to publicly argue about his private life: hence, the freedom of speech easily outweighs the right to privacy.
Which rights were in conflict
Freedom of expression and the freedom of the privacy, in this case, referred to Articles 10 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights Convention (ECHR). According to Article 10 (1) of the ECHR, every person has the right to freedom of expression. This right includes freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.
However, this right shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises. In addition, this right is subject to certain restrictions imposed by Article 10 (2) such as formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties which are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
The right to privacy is mentioned in Article 8 (1) of the ECHR as Right to respect for private and family life. Accordingly, every person has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. Public authorities cannot interfere with the exercise of this right except the situations mentioned in Article 8 (2) such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
How freedom of speechoutweighs the privacy
When there is a conflict between the right to freedom of speech and the right to privacy, a confusion arises, which one would prevail and how to strike a necessary balance between them. In this case, the claimant and his son-in-law used to argue about their personal and business matters in the newspapers. A newspaper published an allegation that the claimant was dismissed from a company because he had been misappropriating corporate monies to fund his second and secret family. The claimant sought a privacy injunction against it to restrain publication. The Queens Bench Division of the High Court refused to grant it. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision.
The Lord Justice Gross held that right to privacy could be engaged. This is rational since the information was related to family life. However, the relationship of the second family was considered a bare fact by the Court. It further held, the evidence must come from the affected family members to prove the privacy, otherwise, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy. The Court held that the awareness of the first family about the second one has reduced the weight of privacy claim. It seems irrational because the awareness of the first family does not necessarily mean, the information is placed in the public domain.
Furthermore, one of the most important arguments considered by the Court in favour of freedom of speech was the public interest, mainly consisting the fact that Hutcheson and Ramsey were arguing about their problems in newspapers. However, this argument could be rebutted because when someone is talking about his private life in newspapers, it does not necessarily lead to a public interest which contributes to a democratic debate, while in the present case, the issue appears to be purely private.
Moreover, since the claimant has selected which part of his private life to be disclosed, newspapers should not be allowed to use freedom of speech to publish other details. Accordingly, in the cases Rocknroll v News Group Newspapers Ltd [2013], Contostavlos v Mendahum [2012] and AMP v Persons Unknown [2011], Courts held, although certain information was already in the public domain, a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy for the remaining undisclosed information.
Public forum
Nevertheless, when regularly giving details about ones private life, a public forum is created. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that newspapers desire to learn more about it because such behaviour develops a public curiosity. Hence, repeated publications by the claimant on newspapers have created a public forum which deprives his privacy claim. Therefore, claimant's inability to maintain privacy in the past has already been counted against him by Courts. A similar view was taken in Carina Trimingham v Associated Newspapers Ltd [2012].
Eventually, the Court of Appeal has given importance to the fact that the claimant has given many personal details about his private life. Consequently, if someone reveals his private life he cannot remain completely private in a public forum. Such a situation permits Article 10 to be applied and outweighs the right to privacy. The Court could have possibly improved the justifications, by investigating whether the claimant was a public figure or not, to make a balance between Article 10 and Article 8.

G20: Trump and Putin to have first face-to-face talks

US President Donald Trump is to have his first face-to-face encounter with Russia's leader Vladimir Putin at a G20 summit in Germany's city of Hamburg.
They have both said they want to repair ties, which were damaged by the Syria and Ukraine crises, and also Russia's alleged meddling in the US election.
Ahead of the G20, 76 police officers were hurt in clashes with protesters. Mass rallies are expected on Friday.
World leaders face their own divisions over climate change and trade.
Trump-Putin rendezvous - what are the main issues
The two leaders are due to meet on Friday afternoon on the sidelines of the G20 summit.
Russian media have said that the meeting will last for an hour, but later reports suggest it could be about 30 minutes.
The presidents are expected to focus mainly on the Syria and Ukraine issues.
On Thursday, Trump used a speech in the Polish capital Warsawto call on Russia to stop "destabilising" Ukraineand other countries.
Moscow should also end support for "hostile regimes" such as those in Syria and Iran and "join the community of responsible nations," he said.
President Trump urged Russia to join the "fight against common enemies and in defence of civilisation itself".
The Kremlin rejected his comments.
Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula in 2014, and is accused of sending troops and weapons to separatists in Ukraine's east.
Moscow denies the allegations, but admits that Russian "volunteers" are fighting with the rebels.
In Syria, Washington supports some armed opposition groups, while Moscow is the main ally of President Bashar al-Assad.
The Kremlin has been stressing the potential for finding some common ground, but Trump's choice of words aimed at Russia in his Warsaw speech suggests he recognises the political danger of being seen as too close to Putin and he is already trying to land some blows, the BBC's James Robbins says.
And it remains to be seen whether the issue of Russia's alleged interference into the US presidential election in 2016 will arise at the Trump-Putin talks.
G20 - a potentially fractious summit
The leaders of the world's major economies face their own disagreements during a series of planned bilateral meetings in Germany's northern city.
Last week German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the G20 wouldfocus on the Paris climate deal - an international agreement on tackling climate change - which the US has withdrawn from.
But earlier she said that, as the G20 host, she would work to find compromises.
Meanwhile,British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to challenge President Trump over climate changeby saying that the Paris Agreement should not be renegotiated.
Another potential thorny issue at the G20 is trade.
Merkel and other EU leaders have expressed their commitment to an open international trading system, while the Trump administration favours protectionism under the "America First" motto.
What about protesters
Thursday's clashes, which continued into the night, began when police charged at masked protesters at a "Welcome to hell" march attended by 12,000 people.
Police fired water cannon and pepper spray at masked protesters, who hurled bottles, stones and flares.
Medics were seen treating several people. At least one person appeared to have been seriously hurt and was carried away covered by a foil blanket.
More mass demonstrations are expected on Friday, with up to 100,000 protesters expected over the two-day event.
Anti-G20 activists first plan to blockade the city's harbour and the summit venue at Hamburg Messe and Congress Centre.
A march by children and youths is being organised later in the morning, and separate gatherings - including a "Sink Capitalism" rally - are expected later in the day.

Gene technology to be introduced soon to treat cancer

Arrangements have been made to offer gene technology based treatment for cancer patients in Sri Lanka under the direction of Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
He has ordered health authorities to produce a report on this matter within two weeks, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, there are 11 doctors in Sri Lanka at the moment who have the required knowledge and training on this latest treatment method.
Two of those doctors are abroad at the moment.
Others have held a discussion with Minister Senaratne and have offered their fullest cooperation to introduce the technology in Sri Lanka.
The main objective of the discussion was to set up a separate unit for the treatment.
Minister Senaratne said that gene therapy cancer treatment named Keytruda was produced in the US.
The treatment is given to the gene which produces the cancer.
Sri Lankan doctors will be given training in three foreign universities named Breral, Rice and Houston.
Cancer has become the second Non Communicable Disease (NCD) that kills people and it will become number one soon. Cancer patients can be cured using gene technology and the US is doing it at the moment, the Minister said.

GMOA accuses Health Ministry of hiding real dengue stats
The Health Ministry is hiding the real statistics of dengue. It says 80,000 dengue patients and 227 deaths had been reported from countrywide, but some other statistics say that the total number of dengue patients reported so far is over 86,000 with over 300 deaths.
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) requested an appointment from the President for a discussion, GMOA Secretary Dr.Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday he said at present 32 out every 10,000 dengue patients die. Dengue has become a real killer in Sri Lanka. There is no assurance that the total number of dengue patients will not exceed 150,000 by the end of December.
According to Dr. Aluthge, all GMOA member doctors are ready to come to the most affected areas and serve the dengue patients but the Health Ministry does not have a strategy to make use of this offer.
The Health Ministry had sent back around Rs.6,000 million to the Treasury without utilising these funds while health staff working to to control the dengue menace do not even have adequate transportation or at least a cup of tea,alleges Dr.Aluthge.
Accommodating two or three dengue patients in one bed increases the risk posed to their health, he said. Dr.Aluthge also accused the Health Ministry of carring out fumigation in a very unscientific manner and to just please the politicians.
Health officials fool the Health Minister who should not fool the people by telling fairy tales about vegetarian mosquitoes, the GMOA Secretary added.

GST could dampen India gold demand in short-term WGC
A hike in taxes on gold sales in India could pressure short-term demand from the world's No.2 consumer of the metal, the World Gold Council (WGC) said in a report.
Faltering appetite in a country where gold is used in everything from investment to wedding gifts could drag further on global prices, already trading near their lowest level in 7-weeks.
In the short-term at least, we believe (the tax) may pose challenges for the industry. Small-scale artisans and retailers with varying degrees of tax compliance may struggle to adapt, the WGC said in a report published on Thursday.
As part of a new nationwide sales tax regime that kicked in on July 1, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on gold has jumped to 3 percent from 1.2 percent previously.
There have been fears the tax increase could stoke under-the-counter buying and drive up appetite for precious metal smuggled into India, where millions of people store chunks of their wealth in bullion and jewellery.
Meanwhile, the WGC also said a government move to ban cash transactions over 200,000 rupees ($3,090) from April 1 could hurt gold demand in rural areas where farmers often purchase the metal using cash due to limited access to cheques and electronic payment systems.
Two-thirds of India's gold demand comes from rural areas, where jewellery is a traditional store of wealth.
(The transactions rule's) potential impact isn't entirely clear: it could curb gold purchases; it could encourage gold shoppers to buy smaller amounts of gold spread over more transactions; or it could push a large part of demand underground and encourage a black market in gold, said the WGC.
The group kept its demand estimate for India at 650 to 750 tonnes for 2017, well below average annual demand of 846 tonnes in the past five years.
In the long-term, the GST will have a positive effect on the gold industry by making the sector more transparent and improving the supply chain, the WGC added. (BBC)

Manning Market: Its business and its vendors
Mohamed Saleem Mohideen sat with his chickens at Stall No. 505, at Manning Market. A few metres away a truck loaded with more crates of chicken was preparing to take off, its contents squawking and ruffling their feathers. He filled in a balance sheet.
This is the rhythm of Mohideens days: Buying chickens, selling chickens and butchering chickens. They are the actions that make up the billions of rupees that flow through the markets of Pettah every day, the economic heart of Sri Lanka.
Ive been here ten years, Mohideen told me, as he put down his pencil. Business is very good.
Discovering Pettah
Pettah began as a market outside of a Colonial Fort, which was built by the Portuguese and then taken over by the Dutch and later the British. The name comes from the Tamil word pettai, which means literally, the town outside the Fort. Much of the Fort had been demolished over the years, but the market had only grown.
Today, the historic buildings of the Fort are being rehabilitated, housing new luxury hotels and restaurants. But Pettah remains a place for different types of people. You could buy pretty much anything or everything in Pettah, from cell phones, to textiles, to whole sides of beef.
I arrived in Colombo last week from the United States. In the cities I have lived back home, we dont have big open-air markets such as the ones in Pettah. My fellow reporters said I had to go see it. So I left my news desk at the Daily News on Monday afternoon to explore Pettah for myself.
Getting there was very tough for a clueless Suddha. I had to dodge buses and trucks, while disappointing a few tuk-tuk drivers. I followed men hunched over heavy loads of onions and egg plants as they plunged through crowds. The streets began to get more and more clogged and I began bumping into people clumsily. At the traffics thickest choke point on Olcott Mawatha, I turned into Manning Market, Pettahs main food bazaar.
It was 11 Oclock in the morning and the early rush was over. Still, people bargained over prices, and trucks squeezed through the narrow streets, driving fresh meat and produce out to restaurants, food stalls and grocery stores of Colombo.
In a cool store room, Asoka Dalpadadu was selling a little bit of everything. He walked me past bags of beets, limes, carrots, and mangoes.
Its better here than the Food City, he told me, showing off a huge bundle of leeks.
Dragging on a cigarette, he tried to get me to buy a whole kilo of eggplants.
Through Asokas shop, Manning Market winds backwards and is organized by types of food. I followed a line of pineapples to a row of green onions. Behind them were bananas, kilos and kilos of them stored in a warehouse to stay fresh for tomorrows market. Workers misted the bananas, which were lying around in varying shades of ripeness, with spray bottles. One banana seller told me that they sell every day of the week, all year long, except on Poya days: the Buddhist holiday that falls on the full moon of each month.
Best chicken around
Passing the bananas, I met Mohideen and his fellow chicken-sellers. They occupy the back corner of Manning Market. There are five of them and they are all Muslims, he told me. They butcher the chickens Halaal-style, cutting the throat and draining out the blood of every hen.
Mohideen said he sells his chickens throughout the city. Some might be sold in other markets, some might be made into chicken curry at local food stalls, called hotels because of the late hours they keep.
Mohammad Fais, another vendor, came over from two stalls down for a chat.
They insisted that all chicken sellers were friends of each other. For an American, this is hard to understand. I cant imagine five shop owners in Boston or New York, all selling the same thing, at the same hour, every day of the week, not trying to undercut the others business.
We all have our own clients, Mohideen said. We are all friends.
The heat of the day was climbing and the chickens were getting hot. Eranddani Wijesinha, who works with Mohideen, doused the birds with a bucket of water.
I decided that I too needed to cool off.
A city of contradictions
I left Manning Market and walked back onto the main road. Across the street, I watched people take off their shoes to enter a Buddhist temple. The temple was next to the Federation of Self-Employees market, another sub-market of Pettah. A gleaming white Buddha statue sat on the temples roof. Below him, vendors sold an assortment of watches, cell phones, pants and bags.
I walked down the street further, passed a shop where men bet on horse races and turned into St. Philip Neri Church. The old Catholic church was painted in faded colours, in contrast to the bright pastels of other shops. About a dozen people sat in its dim sanctuary looking silently ahead. Six candles burned on the front altar. Towards the back of the church, a man was making an offering to a statue of St. Anthony.
Somehow, amidst all the noises and heat of the markets, people found a space to pray.
I stepped out of the church and into bright sunlight. Across the street from me, the glimmering, half-constructed blossom of the ultra-luxury Lotus Tower shot high above the stalls of Manning Market. Pettah teemed all around me.Buses blew hot wind across my face, the sounds of their engines mixing with amplified voices of men calling selling lottery tickets.
To me, all these sensations seemed contradictory, since business and worship, hot and cold, shouting and smiles. And yet Pettahs markets run day in and day out just like this, fuelling the life of Colombo.
It is a city I do not know. But I hope to know it better. So I walked back to office, opened my computer and began working.

President Maithripalala Srisena yesterday assured the Maha Nayaka Theras of the Three Chapters that the government will not bring any constitutional reforms that will disrupt the countrys unitary state or the place for Buddhism.
The President also informed the Maha Nayaka theras that there has been no new constitution drafted yet. Should there be a new draft Constitution it will be presented to the Mahahanayaka Theras and the leaders of the clergy of other religions for review before it will go to Parliament, he said.
President Maithripala Sirisena said so during nearly two-hour long discussion held between him and the Mahanayaka Theras. A company of 22 bhikkhus were present with the Mahanayaka Theras, Most Ven Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala of the Malwatte Chapter, Most Ven Warakagoda Gnanarathana of the Asgiriya Chapter and Most Ven Napana Pemasiri of the Ramanna Chapter.

No change to Status of Buddhism: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe assured Parliament that he would not allow to amend Article 9 of the Constitution and will keep the status of Buddhism unchanged.
The argument arose when JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardene charged that a draft of the Constitution was presented at a recent seminar at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH).
The Premier tabled the documents circulated at the recent seminar at the BMICH on constitutional reforms held on June 28. He said such a document as pointed out by MP Gunawardena had not been circulated that day. He said he would look into the matter raised by MP Gunawardena and state the true situation.
MP Gunawardene said the Most Venerable Maha Nayaka Theras have got alarmed because according to the same draft, Article 9 of the Constitution and the status of Buddhism is to be taken away.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that if a document was distributed at the BMICH it would be wrong as such a thing cannot happen when the Steering Committee had not come to an agreement on any draft.
Premier Wickremesinghe said that what was available as of today are summaries of different proposals placed before the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee had not come up with any draft, the Premier said. I will not allow to amend the Article 9 as long as I remain as the chairman of the Steering Committee.
MP Gunawardene argued that the Prime Minister cannot deny that there is a proposal by some elements to amend the Article 9. He said Minister Rajitha Senaratne has no right to state at the Cabinet briefing that Maha Nayaka Theras had nothing to fear.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe later said he had inquired from the Steering Committee whether any draft has been put out. I inquired from the Steering Committee, and they assured me now no draft had been circulated, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the document MP Gunawardena was referring to was not the one circulated at the seminar at the BMICH but what he had received from the Operation Committee as its member.

PCI-DSS compliance to end outstanding credit card settlements via SLIPS
LankaClear (Pvt) Ltd, the operator of Sri Lankas National Payment Network announced that due to a Payment Card Industry, Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) compliance requirement payments towards outstanding credit card settlements would not be facilitated via Sri Lanka Interbank Payment System (SLIPS) from July 1, 2017.
SLIPS is a same day batch mode payment system operated by LankaClear that facilitated a majority of the payment transactions towards credit card settlements up to now.
However, LankaClear, in its effort to increase customer convenience and provide an uninterrupted service, has ensured that the same facility is available via LankaPay CEFTS Real Time Payment system. CEFTS is an on-line real time payment system that facilitates customers to initiate payment transactions 24X7 from one bank or non-banking finance institution connected to CEFTS to another utilizing multiple channels available such as Internet banking, mobile banking, ATMs or even over the counter.
Channa de Silva, CEO LankaClear, said, We are the first and the only entity in the country to have obtained the PCI-DSS certification, which we received in January 2017.
This standard is an internationally recognized and widely accepted set of policies and procedures intended to ensure the security of card transactions and protect cardholders against misuse of their personal information.
These changes are effected as a concerted effort by LankaClear to bring Sri Lankas entire payment industry into international standards, he said.
He said that they have informed all Sri Lankan banks and non-banking institutions who are members of LankaPay network about this impending change way back in October 2016 and instructed them to get their systems ready by 31st March 2017.
However, since certain banks requested more time for development on their side we further extended this deadline until 30th June 2017.
As of July 1, 2017, five banks, namely Hatton National Bank, National Development Bank, Nations Trust Bank, Sampath Bank and Seylan Bank have enabled credit card holders of their banks to make payments towards settlement of their outstanding via CEFTS.
LankaClear has requested all other banks to adhere to the above compliance requirements and the relevant banks will inform the card holders when their systems are ready to accept real time credit card settlement payments via CEFTS. he further stated.

Preethi Jayawardena takes over helm of SLID
The Sri Lanka Institute of Directors (SLID) held their Annual Membership Meeting (AMM) with over 85 members present at this momentous evening when the leadership of the Institute changed hands.
Shiromal Cooray completed her term as Chairperson and at the AMM Preethi Jayawardena was elected unanimously as the new Chairman of SLID for the year 2017/18.
The other officials elected to the Council of members for the year 2017/18 were Rasakantha Rasiah as Senior Vice Chairman, Faizal Salieh as Vice Chairman and Dilani Alagaratnam, Aroshi Nanayakkara, Dinesh Weerakkody, Prakash Schaffter and Vish Govindasamy as Council Members. Dilshan Rodrigo was elected to fill the vacancy created by Council Member Nilanthi Sivapragasagam.
The Annual Report and Financial Statements for the period ending 31st March 2017 were presented and approved by the membership.
In his first address as Chairman of SLID, Preethi Jayawardena acknowledged the many contributions made by past Council Members to the development of SLID.
Seed capital to establish and develop SLID as an independent body was provided by the Carsons Group, Chemanex, Hatton National Bank, Jetwing Group and John Keells Group.
The new Chairman said the promotion of gender diversity within SLID has helped bring the organization even further with more drive and fresh ideas.
Speaking of the economy of Sri Lanka, Jayawardena stressed on the importance of foreign direct investment and how it is essential for the expansion of the countrys economic growth.
He said, The abundance of resources present in Sri Lanka and the converse lack of foreign funding do not match up well, given the potential for growth displayed by our private sector.
Chief Guest for the evening, Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama thanked SLID for the contributions it had made in the improvement of the economy of Sri Lanka. He asserted that the prevailing government strongly believes that 'the private sector is the motor of growth'. He urged the members of SLID to continue the growth in their companies which would help the country as a whole.
Dr. Amunugama explained that Sri Lankas unique social structure makes way for a different structure of ownership which is different from the known structure of where the rich and powerful run all of the private sector, to one where many invest and participate at the top level of the private sector and collectively reap the benefits of its growth, moving the private sector regime of Sri Lanka from capitalistic moguls to that of modern corporations.
He further said that the prevailing government is looking into ways to further push this model on the population to encourage collective growth. The issue faced however is how to keep the returns from investment at a more attractive rate than offered by the prevailing savings system offered by banks.
Speaking on the opportunities opening up for the growth of trade and industry in the Asian region, the Minister pointed to the regional growth in population, especially in India which has an rapidly increasing middle class. This of course, opens many doors in terms of markets to enter and profit from for the private sector of Sri Lanka.
Dr. Amunugama made it a salient and recurring point in his speech to emphasize Sri Lankas strategic positioning in the midst of the Indian Ocean which is the countrys prized asset that needs to be better utilized.
In order to take advantage of its strategic position, Dr. Amunugama spoke of the free trade agreement between Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh.
Even more importantly, he said that the Government is currently in the process of negotiating free trade agreements with Pakistan, the remainder of the SAARC region and China, as well as a conditional trade agreement with Japan.

The members of the Mahasangha had pointed out to the President that a committee is be needed to uncover the truth about such instances where some well-organized parties and individuals have apparently made attempts to discredit the country on an international footing by swaying the hearts and minds of the international community that the country has communal violence between Sinhalese people and communal minority groups.
They called attention of the President that spreading of various false stories by these groups which in most cases have attempted to paint a bad picture of the Sinhalese as hardliners who abuse and attack other ethnic groups, have brought about negative international influence on the country.
The theras further said that what one may get to see on a newspaper may not be true as somebody would have put it or said it. And truth must be disclosed with the help of a committee to investigate such disinformation and those who spread them.

Schokman & Samerawickreme launch first online live auction portal
Well-known Sri Lankas pioneering Chartered Auctioneers Schokman & Samerawickreme launched their first online live auction portal.
The countrys first live auction site via its unique auction portal, www.shopandselllanka.lk to go live by August, will revolutionise the auction industry in Sri Lanka where clients can view a wide gamut of products from motor vehicles to furniture, antiques, jewellery, art and even real estate, bidding live in real time. Overseas buyers too would be able to make purchases.
Schokman & Samerawickreme who celebrate 125 years in auctioneering, realting and valuing was also the first to obtain ISO certification in auctioneering, valuation and real estate in South Asia and the Pacific. The century plus company also has partnerships etched with international real estate greats Savills Australia and Cushman & Wakefield. The 125-year journey began when a planter in Hatton met Shirley Samerawickreme, the Sales Manager at Tuckers/Millers at the horse races in Nuwara Eliya, fuelling a common fascination for auctioneering.
Celebrating the milestone, the third generation of the Samerawickremes, grandsons of Edwin De Alwis Samerawickreme and Shirley Samerawickremes sons, Navinda and Anuja, have taken the business into the 21st century.
The business was built on a mutual fascination for auctioneering between my grandfather and Schokman, whose partnership formed the foundation for the bedrock of auctioneering in Sri Lanka, stated Managing Partner Navinda Samerawickreme.
This wasnt simply auctioneering, but a business that spoke of trust, high quality and strong relationship building.
Edwins sons, Lloyd, Derrick and Carl possessed the vision to expand the business from Kandy, where the Head Office was, into Colombo.
As Navinda recalls, it was Shirley Samerawickreme who was the visionary. Our father was a master auctioneer, born to his craft. Since his entry into the business in 1955, his half century in the trade ensured that the business will become accessible more geographically.
The Auction House now has the addition of a flagship auction sales facility in Colombo 5, where clients can either walk in and purchase items or engage in an auction according to preference.
Our specialty now covers a wide gamut of fields including parate auctioneering and valuations. Being the most experienced and qualified in the market, we have now firmly etched ourselves as the preferred auctioneer among the diplomatic corps, NGOs, individuals and the private sector. This includes the valuation of both movable and immovable property.
Our strength in vehicle auctions is well evidenced in the fact that we conduct at least 100 auctions annually for about 300 to 400 vehicles monthly, said Partner/Chief Executive Officer Anuja Samerawickreme.

Technology Trends in Logistics and Supply Chain Management
The word logistics has its origin from Greek word logistike which means the art of calculating.
However, the modern interpretation of the term logistics has its origin in the military, where it was used to describe the activities related to the procurement of ammunitions, and essential supplies for troops located at the front. Logistics not only includes activities related to the physical movements of the goods but also manages relationship with suppliers and customers. However, logistic management is a means whereby the needs of customers are satisfied through integration and coordination of the supply chain.
The main objective is to determine the various technology used in logistics and supply chain management including information technology, communication technology and automatic identification technology. This also discusses the impact of the technology on logistics and supply chain management.
The council of logistic management defines logistics as that part of supply chain process that plans, implements, and controls the efficient, effective, forward and reverse flow and storage of goods, services, and related information between the point of origin and the point of consumption in order to meet customer requirement. In ordinary language the same can be defined as right product, at the right place, in right time, and in right condition. However supply chain consists of all stages that are required to satisfy the customer request. It starts from supplier passes through manufacturer, distribution, and retailer and finally reaches the customer. The supply chain management is the oversight of materials, information and finances as they move in the process from supplier to manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer to customer.
The emerging new technologies are creating strategic opportunities for the organizations to build competitive advantages in various functional areas of management including logistics and supply chain management. However the degree of success depends on the selection of the right technology for the application, availability of proper organizational infrastructure, culture and management policies. In logistics, information, communication and automation technologies has substantially increased speed of identification, data gathering, processing, analysis and transmission, with high level of accuracy and reliability. Technology is a means to enhance business competitiveness and performance. It plays a major role in success of supply chain by enhancing the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the logistics system. In logistics many new technologies are used in developed country while in India adoption process is very slow. However due to liberalization of the Indian economy the competitive pressure is building up and the only option to face the competition in to go in for technology enabled operations.
The latest technologies being used in logistics and supply chain management are segregated into;
 Automatic Identification Technology
 Communication Technology
 Information Technology
II. OBJECTIVES
* To determine the various technology used in logistics and supply chain management.
* To discusses the impact of technology on logistics and supply chain management.
Automatic Identification Technology
Automatic Identification (Auto ID) is the term used to describe the direct entry of data or information in the computer system, programmable logic controllers or any microprocessor-controlled device without operating a keyboard. These technologies include Bar Coding, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Voice Recognition. Auto ID can be used for tracking the containers, packages, cartons or a truck carrying the goods on time bound dispatches to the customers. The benefits of Auto ID include accuracy, cost saving, speed and convenience of data storage and processing of information.
The significant Automatic Identification technologies in use are 
* Bar coding  Bar coding is a sequence of parallel lines of different thickness with spaces in between. These bars are nothing but the items of information in the codified form, which can be read with the help of a scanner. Historically bar codes was first used in a supermarkets in USA in 1952.The information printed in bar code include, country code, manufacturer name, product details, date of manufacture, material content etc.These details are required at user end for inventory management. The bar codes are used in diverse industries such as retail, pharmaceutical, consumer goods, electronics, automobiles etc.
The bar coding offers the following advantages.
Ease in identification of inventory items during storage, retrieval, pickup, inspection and dispatch.
* Reduce paper work and processing time leading
* Reduce human error
* Increases logistics system productivity through speed, accuracy, and reliability.
Impact of Bar code technology on operations of logistics and supply chain management
 Procurement operation  The parts and components brought from suppliers are assigned bar codes, which contain information on item name, batch number, date of manufacture, order no, serial no etc. The information in barcode helps in identifying and tracking the component. In the warehouse, when the goods enter through a conveyor, they are further scanned by the handheld scanner or scanner fixed alongside the conveyor. The information decoded by the scanner is immediately logged in the central computer which helps real-time update of inventory records.
 Processing  During the order processing the bar code will help in keeping identification of items based on their date of entry into the warehouse or store. This will ease material storage, retrival and dispatch in FIFO (First in First out) inventory management system.
 Production operation  During the production process the identification of in-process and finished items become easier due to bar coding. The various bathes at different stages of production can be easily tracked.
 Distribution operation  During distribution, barcode helps in identifying and tracking the transit of finished goods to the customers.
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)  RFID is an Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) technology. RFID first appeared in tracking and access applications during 1980. RFID-based systems allows for non-contact reading and are effective in manufacturing and other hostile environment where bar codes could not survive. These are used as an alternative to Barcodes to communicate the inventory data to the reader via radio waves. RFID wirelessly exchanges information between a tagged object and a reader.
An RFID system is compromised of the following components as mentioned below.
One or more tags called Radio Frequency Tags (RFTs), which includes a semiconductor chip and antenna.
* One or more read/write devices also called readers.
* Two or more antennas one on the tag and one on the reader.
* Application software and the host computer system.
RFTs
The reader is connected to the central computer. Radio Frequency Tags (RFTs) are a piece of silicon chip to store data in the microcircuit. The RFTs are programmable with erasable memory. Data is stored in coded form and communicated to the reader through waves. The basic principle of tag is that antenna emits the radio signals.RFTs are very useful to accompany truck shipments. The tag will contain information on consignor, consignee, inventory items, quantity, and value, what time the item traveled certain zone; even the temperature etc.The reader receives the tag signal with its antenna, decodes it and transfers the data to the host computer system. RFTs can be attached to virtually anything-from a semi-tractor, to a pallet, containers etc. RFTs will avoid paperwork and can be helpful in quick clearance at octroi and custom posts. In the warehouse, the barcodes can be applied to the individual inventory items while RFTs can be applied to pallets, containers etc.These will allow the staff to directly communicate to the warehouse computer.
RFID has significant impact on logistics and supply chain of many sectors
 RFID helps Indian exporters to global retailers like WAL-MART get better and more visibility into movement of their goods within the supply chain and thus become more competitive.
 Improve the ability of manufacturers to better manage the inventory levels.
 Improve the complex distribution system for the Defense operation.
 Improve the complex tracking and distribution operations of the Indian Postal services.
 Improve the tracking, logistics and planning operations of Indian Railways, state public transport agencies
 Implement automatic toll collection on vast network of highways.
Case study of RFID Technology
Procter & Gamble(P&G) Company
Before  P&G used bar codes to track shipments of goods from factory to retail outlets, but couldnt do much to halt the supply shortages on store shelves.
After  P&G used RFID is tracking shipments, and eventually individual products, so that they can be stocked on demand in stores. P&G expects to cut its costs by $400 million a year.
Ford Motor Company
Before  Assembly-line workers running low on parts would have to pick up a phone and call the replenishment department to get more parts and then wait for parts.
After  Ford puts RFID tags on each parts bin. Warehouse operators now know in seconds, when supplies run low, and automatically deliver parts as needed to workers on the assembly line.
Voice Interactive System  This technology was developed in 1980.It is used in the field like medical, manufacturing, warehousing etc. In warehouse application; it allows the worker or operator to communicate the data to central computer without using the keyboard. It keeps the warehouse workers hands free to pick up, pack and inspect the goods. He can read the part /item number while driving the forklift or picking the inventory and move from one pallet to other pallet. Due to online data transmission to central computer there will be real time data updating.
III. COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY
The communication, either oral or written has a very crucial role in business success. The following are the few emerging communications technologies, which are enablers to superior customer service leading to competitiveness through the speed and accuracy in communication.
 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) - EDI technology is used for transfer of business documents from one computer to other computer. With EDI the business documents such as invoices, cheques, and challans are sent electronically from one organization to another. In fact EDI is a drive towards paperless document transfer or transactions. The difference between the email message and EDI message is that, Email is composed and interpreted manually, while EDI message is composed using one software and interpreted by other software. E-mail data is not structured while EDI data or message is structured.EDI message has legal standing in the court of law.
The benefits of using EDI technology in logistics and supply chain management involves.
* Faster transactions- real time document transfer in the supply chain.  Just-in-Time manufacturing technique can be adopted.
* Reduction in transaction cost due to paperless operations
* Reduction in order cycle time and inventory that will help to improve the competitiveness of the customers.
* Improve the corporate trading relationships between parties in the supply chain and creating barriers for competitors.
* Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) - The satellite communication channels are playing a crucial role in consignor and consignee. The real  time interaction helps in having the up-to-date information on the location of truck and the delivery position.
Example.  Wal-Mart the retail giant of USA is using this system for controlling the inventory movement.
 Geographical positioning System (GPS)  The GPS is more accurate system used in developed countries wherein a vehicle could be traced accurately with the help of Geo Stationary Satellites to the accuracy of one meter in terms of latitude and longitude. Once the position of the vehicle is known, it can be transmitted to consigner or consignee through the transmission network i.e. mobile phones or internet.
 Geographical Information System (GIS)  GIS are the software tools for visualization of special location of any entity on earth which is stored in databases relating to geography .This could be in terms of physical maps of the surface of earth, layout of inner surface of earth or a layout of streets or roadsGIS in integration with GPS is used in logistical operation for tracking and tracing of the consignment location to the extent of road or street in particular city.
 Web Based Tracking Logistics service providers operating in India are extending the services of webbased tracking of consignments to their clients. AFL, Fed-Ex, Blue Dart and others are providing the status report of the consignment to their clients. The clients can download this report by connecting through the Internet. This information helps in planning the dispatch schedule and also making follow up with clients for payment collections.
 Automated Guided Vehicle System (AGVS) - The system makes use of magnetic or optical guidance system. The magnetic system uses energized wire laid on the warehouse floor for guiding the material handling equipment. In AGVS operator is eliminated. The new generation AVGS are guided with video and do not follow the fixed path. AGVS can perform all the material handling operation without any human involvement. Robot coupled with AGVS is used to pick up exact material requirement for a customer order.
 Information Directed System (IDS) - In this a centralized computer controls the material handling equipment. The communication between the equipment and the computer is through radio frequency. The required movement are fed into computer and it assigns the jobs to the individual equipments considering its maximum loading capacity and handling speed.IDS can perform variety of complex material handling jobs such as multiple order picking or multiple vehicle loading by the same material handling equipment leading to enhancement in warehouse productivity and flexibility in handling variety of jobs.
Information Technology (IT) 
IT consists of hardware and software that captures, analyses and provide information wherever it is needed. Since the supply chain management is defined as network of organizations, these organizations cannot form a network unless they are connected through IT resulting into transparency in the supply chain and aligning the supply chain activities towards customer.
Example  The success of supply chain of DELL was due to IT, where internet was used to collect order from customer directly and shared the information with the suppliers so that they can forecast better, and supply to the requirement.
The IT tools used in logistics and supply chain management are-
* Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) -ERP is integrated software, encompassing all the business operations and bring about significant change in the way people work. ERP is a business solution that addresses to certain identified business issues. ERP is very expensive and complex exercise which require sufficient amount of planning. In India major ERP in use is SAP, Oracle which has been developed by foreign companies to suit the business environment prevailing in those countries. However, some Indian companies like Ramco Systems developed ERP to suit Indian business environment.
ERP helps in optimization of supply chain management and develop competitiveness by ensuring the following advantages
Quicker response to customer requirement.
* Reduction in inventory costs.
* Improvement in service levels- internal and external.  Improvement in inventory turnover rate Reduction in logistics cost.
Example - The companies like Hindustan Lever, Colgate and Nestle have implemented ERP in their supply chain system resulting in minimum inventory of raw material and finished goods and benefit in terms of cost reduction
 Distribution Requirement planning(DRP)- It is another IT tool and also a sophisticated planning approach that takes into consideration multiple distribution stages and the characteristics of the distribution system. The finished goods inventory requirement is determined by DRP considering the customer demand at multiple distribution centers located in different markets.DRP helps in consolidating the shipments to multiple locations spread over the vast geographical area, and thus help in reducing freight cost. DRP improves inventory visibility in the supply chain resulting into reduction in inventory level and warehouse space requirement.
 Automated Inventory tracking system (AITS) - The AITS is an IT tool that gives real-time status of the inventory levels of all the items at retail stores, feeder and mother warehouses. For replenishment of items sold, information is conveyed directly to the supplier after the item inventory level is checked at feeder and mother warehouses. The supplier initiates the action to replenish the inventory item depending on the item take-off rate at retail stores, its safety stock, inventory in transit etc thereby optimizing the inventory in the supply chain.
 Example  Wal-Mart, a leading US retail chain giant controlling the inventory investments throughout the supply chain with the help of AITS.
 Impact of IT on functions of logistics and supply chain management are as follows
 Procurement- In the initial period the procurement process in the organization was done by a separate department on the basis of least price from the supplier. In the next generation with the advent of IT the e-procurement is done where online auctions are conducted and strategic relations are forged with good suppliers by long term contracts and relationships.
 Planning In the initial period before the advent of IT, production and distribution planning was done based on historical data. There was not much linkage with business planning and production changed with varying demand. However with the advent of IT planning approach include collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment (CPRF). It involves long-term commitment to information sharing for collaborative planning purposes like joint business planning (SKUs, brands) and financial planning.(sales, inventory, safety stock, pricing, fill rate).
 Web-based collaboration- The web-based collaboration application enables to share and collaborate with supply chain partners on forecasts, replenishment and promotions plans to deliver the highest level of customer service and profitability.
 Scheduling In the initial period the scheduling was done to improve asset utilization and reduce manufacturing costs. However with the advent of IT strong linkage is established between supply chain partners and customers. As such scheduling is done to serve the customer at the right time.
 Inventory management In the initial period every department tried to minimize the inventory by transferring it to the next level of the supply chain. Thus the total inventory cost in the supply chain was high as there was no transparency of the inventory held in the supply chain. However with the advent of IT, techniques such as collaborative replenishment and vendor managed inventory were followed where manufacturer takes the responsibility to replenish the distributor inventory, resulting in inventory control and access to demand information.
 Logistics and warehouse management  In the initial period logistics was more manual intensive and there was no visibility of the movement of goods. However due to the advent of IT and technologies like RFID and GPS complete visibility in movement of goods is assured resulting into efficient logistic and warehouse management.
 Customer service In the initial period customer service was only reactive. The complaints or information was difficult to reach the concerned department and was time-consuming process. However with the advent of IT, customer service is more proactive as it reaches the customer through internet and takes continuous feedback from them.

IV. CONCLUSION

Technology is vehicle to enhance supply chain competitiveness and performance by enhancing the overall effectiveness and efficiency of logistics system. Hence choosing the right technology for various logistics activities or sub-processes is very crucial to any business to gain competitive advantage in todays competitive market.Example  A cycle manufacturer must see how it can integrate the smallest component provider- namely, a brake shoe supplier and also the dealer at the rural center, in order to optimize production run and retain the customer instead of losing to the competitor. Today integration in the supply chain is possible due to available technology leading to efficiency in the supply chain only if the supply chain partners adopt the right strategy.

Toques of Polonnaruwa
Juliet Coombe meets the Talking Toques of Polonnaruwa on a Monkey Kingdom tour with Smithsonian Primates experts who now run superb early morning tours in the ruins
Nested deep in the wilderness of this 25,000 square mile island of Sri Lanka is an ethereal ancient city in which the Toques monkeys cohabited with man in this once thriving one thousand year old kingdom of Polonnaruwa devoted to Buddha and his teachings, science, advanced irrigation systems, medicine and grand architectural designs.
The changing times
A thousand years on, the ruins of this hydraulic civilization are still amazingly well preserved for a city that was brought to its knees by the invasion of the South Indian King Kalinga Magha in 1215 AD, who brutally removed the eyes of King Parakrama and tortured him and his people to death. Biking and walking around this magnificent site with primates experts one sees the mischievous Toque monkeys in a new light as you go around some of the most fascinating historic sights including the countries most advanced Ayurveda hospital. On the morning I went one of the 38 troops living in the Polonnaruwa sanctuary were playing early morning in the medical hospital ruins, which still have a complete human shaped treatment room to cure snake bites with a herbal bath.
As you learn about Toques grooming one can take in the majesty of this huge monastery complex and at a time when Buddhas teachings drove these spiritually advanced people to not waste even a drop of water and be a part of nature and not apart from it. Abandoned for around seven hundred years by man but not by beast, the Toque Macaque monkeys, one of three species of Macaque found in Sri Lanka, still remember who they are and what they are doing here, in the jungle ruins of the UNESCO World Heritage site, Polonnaruwa, even though the forest is under threat as the numbers of trees are declining. The monkey numbers in contrast have evolved with the changing times finding new food sources in peoples near by homes, and numbers as a result are going up. This is good news on one hand as they form a key part of the ecosystem by eating fruits and dispersing seeds through defecation and as such vital to the jungle surroundings. However today like the elephant human conflict, increasing numbers of Toques are creating a human monkey conflict as well.
Intelligent creatures
Walking around observing their habits one can just imagine the conversations of the monkeys watching us observing them Why have they come back one can almost hear the female known to the team at Jezuma with her baby, who she gently caresses until the naughty monkey calms down and falls to sleep in her arms. You will learn from the primates guide that there are around 1000 Toque Macaque monkeys in the sanctuary defined area of Polonnaruwa, arranged into 38 troops with groups ranging from 5 to 70 in each, comprising of complex social orders of these highly engaging, dextrous and intelligent creatures.
Toques it seems on close inspection look younger the older they get until when adult they have a full head of hair resembling a brimless hat, possibly giving rise to the original haircuts we saw The Beatles sporting in the 1960s music scene but certainly giving rise to their name, Toque, meaning whorl of hair.
The offspring need to be tough in this environment where, owing to food scarcity at times and stiff competition, only around 60% make it past infancy with only a stunning 15% to 20% reaching adulthood although these numbers according to the guides are changing as the monkeys find new ways to get food by raiding local village homes.
Alerting others
The monkeys carry on about their business of monkeying around trying to steal pilgrim flowers with their allies the Grey Languar from the altar of the Gal Vihara sacred Buddha site, although in some cases it feels like they are also taking them in offerings to the lying Buddha as often they leave some here and wander off to do some daily grooming.
Suddenly, the peace is broken and the air is electrified with the sound of a hard braking high speed train-like noise from the wide open mouth of one of the other males, revealing two huge fangs that can rip through human flesh. I am told by the guide that he isnt best pleased with another approaching troop of competitors. As if it isnt enough to have to forage in the current desert like dry zone conditions with temperatures so hot that by 9am your feet feel like they are on fire from the sand underfoot. Male dominance is also seen as a form of birth control, through being the first eaters and leaving the weaker to go hungry, and so a natural population balances mechanism for when food goes short in this rather brutal wild ancient kingdom. Toques also make birdlike noises when alerting others to threats such as pythons as they have excellent eye site protecting us as we follow them through the bushes. Interestingly until the Toques monkeys are one years of age they cant talk and when the alarm call comes the group of mothers pick up the nearest baby and climb the trees, where they return the young to the rightful mother.
This new scene of brooding violence where the males of each troop will fight it out for the right to eat and mate like a scene from Gangs of New York, is watched over by the equally unyielding and contrasting manmade edifice, standing for over a millennium, with its beautifully rounded white dome made out of white uneven plaster with ribbed cone pointing to the heavens, directing us to strive for that inner peace within our souls and nature.

Uma Oya project to proceed

The government will go ahead with the completion of the Uma Oya Multi-purpose Development Project as the majority of work has already been completed, State Minister of Mahaweli Development, Mahinda Amaraweera said today.
The project would resolve water issues in the Moneragala District and while the last government also planned to take water to Hambantota through it, due to protests, we have limited the project to Moneragala. We also expect it to serve the Badulla district, said the Minister addressing a media briefing at the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Ministery and he stressed that contrary to various reports, almost 45 percent of the project had been completed when the government took over office in 2015.
According to the State Minister, it would take another three years of remedial measures to bring back the water table to normal after the project had dried up many of the brooks in the area. 
At this point it is better to complete the project and resolve the environmental problems than stop it all together, he said.
Amaraweera who is part of a three member cabinet sub-committee to look into the issues surrounding the project undertook a tour of the area and recently submitted his findings to the President.
On Thursday evening, the Mahaweli Development Ministry released a statement stating that drill machines at the lower sector of the tunnel will be removed within the next ten days and excavation work would be suspended until a water leak is fixed.
The Swiss team which was consulted for the project has recommended that we use a more modern machine for excavations which can seal the leaks after drilling. We should have used such a machine from the start but that was not done. We are going to bring down the parts needed for that, said Amaraweera.
A team from Norway too is set to visit the country on 31 July and the Minister added that the government take further action based on their report expected to be submitted by 15 August.
We will seek both local and foreign expertise on it. But thus far it has become clear that a project of such nature and magnitude needed a more in depth environmental impact assessment than what had been done.
Our reports also indicate that these drilling machines were more suitable for desert conditions and not sensitive environments like ours. If we used the right machinery, such water issues would not have arisen, he said.
The State Minister also revealed that the Iranian company; FARAB Energy and Water Project Company contracted to undertake the project had no experience in this area and it was their first such project, Perhaps they were recommended by the Iranian government. We are not sure, but all this would be looked into by the Parliament Select Committee appointed to investigate into it, he said
Iran, said Amaraweera had initially provided a loan of USD 50 million for the project in 2008 but the funds had dried up later on. The project is now fully funded by the government and was expected to cost Rs 80 billion in total but with the recent environmental disaster, costs are expect to increase significantly, We have thus far spent Rs 67 billion, said Amaraweera.
