Actor Sean Penn's meeting with Mexico kingpin led to capture
MEXICO : US actor Sean Penn interviewed Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman three months before the Mexican drug lord's capture this week, Rolling Stone magazine revealed Saturday, a meeting that helped authorities track down the kingpin.
The US rock magazine published a picture showing Penn in a black shirt shaking hands with the mustachioed Sinaloa drug cartel leader, who is in a blue shirt, on October 2.
Penn writes that the 58-year-old Guzman gave him a big hug when they met at a Mexican jungle clearing and had a seven-hour sitdown followed by phone and video interviews. "I supply more heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana than anybody else in the world," Guzman told Penn in a stunning admission of his criminal enterprise over sips of tequila.
"I have a fleet of submarines, airplanes, trucks and boats," Guzman said in the meeting, which Mexican actress Kate del Castillo helped to arrange.
A Mexican federal official told AFP that authorities "had knowledge of this meeting" and that it helped lead to Friday's recapture of the world's most wanted man in his northwestern home state of Sinaloa. Mexican Attorney General Arely Gomez said on Friday that Guzman had met with unnamed actors and producers in the hope of making a biopic about himself.
Rolling Stone also published a video showing Guzman without a mustache, talking about why he decided to go into drug trafficking after the age of 15 because there were "no job opportunities."
"Unfortunately, where I grew up, there was and there is no other way to survive," Guzman said.
Asked if he feels responsible for the high level of addictions in the world, he said: "It's false. The day that I don't exist, it won't reduce drug trafficking."
The Rolling Stone interview emerged after Mexican prosecutors announced that they would seek Guzman's extradition to the United States, a reversal from President Enrique Pena Nieto's refusal to send him across the border.
The Attorney General's office said it received two US extradition requests last year on a slew of charges, including drug trafficking and murder, and that it later obtained arrest warrants to ship him across the border.
"With Guzman Loera's recapture, the respective extradition proceedings will have to start," the office said in a statement.
It did not indicate when the hearings would start and noted that Guzman's lawyers could seek appeals.
One of Guzman's attorneys, Juan Pablo Badillo, vowed to take the case up to the Supreme Court if necessary.
"He shouldn't be extradited because Mexico has a fair Constitution," Badillo told reporters outside the Altiplano prison near Mexico City, where Guzman was sent following his arrest. - AFP

All should unite to formulate new constitution - President
All of should unite in formulating the new constitution to build a modern Sri Lankan State in the 21st century, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
"Whenever a government attempted to draft a new constitution a kind of unrest had erupted in the country," President said.
Delivering a special statement on drafting a new constitution, President Sirisena told the Parliament on Saturday that whenever a government attempted to draft a new constitution a kind of unrest erupted in the country.
"Even today some sections of the society are trying to create unrest to make the government uncomfortable," he said.
The President emphasized that it is the responsibility of everyone to unite towards this and draft a new constitution for the betterment of the future generation by keeping aside narrow political agendas.
Refusing the rumours spreading across the country allegedly by some extremists claiming that the government is implementing the new constitution under foreign influence, President Sirisena said that there is no foreign influence in formulating the new constitution and this will be done understanding the needs of the country.
"The government's intention is to consider the ideas of all sections including the scholars, intellectuals and Constitutional experts in drafting the new constitution, he said.
President Sirisena also said that depicting the new constitution, which is focused on the betterment of the country, as a Billa (boogeyman) is a great sin.
The President said that we should not maintain the Executive Presidency to prevent the possibility of emerging a war in the future, but to create an environment to prevent recurrence of such a situation.
President Sirisena also pointed out that we should not preserve the constitution as words etched on stone and changes should be made according to the aspirations of the people and it should be suitable for the modern technological world. He also said that even though the laws and constitution are retained in whatever mode, the success of these aspects depends on characteristics of the people who are initiating these things.

Kusal Perera to seek help from SLC
Kusal Perera who is under a cloud after being tested positive for a banned drug is to seek Sri Lanka Cricket help to clear his name and make an early return to international cricket.
"Kusal met me yesterday (Saturday) and said that he is going to appeal to Sri Lanka Cricket," said SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala.
"After he appeals to us we will try to find a solution. We have no idea what position he has taken, but once he writes to us we will have an ExCo meeting and the committee will take a decision how we will have to go through it," he said.
"The ICC's Anti-Doping Committee has conducted this test and found him guilty. He is fighting his case separately with the ICC but in the mean time he is appealing to me directly. I will take the matter up separately.
"We will have to look at the ICC position with regard to his case and the legal position and wee how best we can handle it. He has the right to appeal and he is doing that."
Decision on head coach after team returns
A decision on a head coach for the Sri Lanka team will be taken after they return from the tour of New Zealand on January 13.
"We want to talk to the national captain, current coach and the chairman of selectors, discuss with them and by about January 15 take a decision which road map we want to take," said Sumathipala.
"Until they return we are not going to make any decisions. We have no idea what internal decisions have been taken and what has gone wrong.
"I am in favour of a non Sri Lankan coach. If the current team is settled with the current coach before the World T20 we will have to look at it that way. We will make an assessment when they return and decide T20 World Cup as a short term and then someone for a long term," he said.
Sri Lanka to host u19 asia cup
The Asian Cricket Council at its meeting in Dubai decided that Sri Lanka will host the 2016 Under 19 Asia Cup in May.

Merkel talks tough on migrant lawbreakers
GERMANY: German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday backed stricter laws to expel convicted refugees, as clashes erupted at far-right protests in Cologne over a rash of sexual assaults blamed on asylum seekers.
Cologne police said they have now recorded 379 cases of New Year's Eve violence -- ranging from groping to theft to two reported rapes -- with asylum seekers and illegal migrants making up the majority of suspects.
With anger growing at the scale of the attacks, supporters of the xenophobic PEGIDA movement marched in protests that briefly turned violent in the western city.
Police used tear gas and water cannon to clear the rally of far-right supporters after protesters flung firecrackers and bottles at officers they said had failed to prevent the New Year's attacks on women.
Vowing tough action, Merkel declared that any refugee handed a jail term -- even if it was a suspended sentence -- should be kicked out of the country.
If the law does not suffice, then the law must be changed, she said, pledging action to protect not just German citizens, but innocent refugees too.
Witnesses described terrifying scenes of hundreds of women running a gauntlet of groping hands, lewd insults and robberies in the mob violence.
Of the cases reported so far, 40 percent related to sexual violence, Cologne police said in a statement.
Those in focus of criminal police investigations are mostly people from North African countries. The majority of them are asylum seekers and people who are in Germany illegally, police added, confirming witness accounts.
The allegations have stoked criticism of Merkel's liberal open-door policy -- which brought 1.1 million new asylum seekers to Germany last year.
As questions grew over the country's ability to integrate the newcomers, it emerged late Saturday that a man who was killed trying to attack a police station in Paris on Thursday had lived in an asylum seeker shelter in Germany.
Revealing that they had raided the man's apartment, German police did not specify if he was an asylum seeker, but a source close to the matter told AFP that the man was indeed registered as one.
In Tunisia, a woman who claimed to be the man's mother confirmed that he had been living in Germany but denied he had any links to extremist groups.
In Cologne, hundreds of PEGIDA supporters waved German flags and signs saying Rapefugees not welcome, as they shouted Merkel raus (Merkel out).
The rattle of a helicopter circling in the skies and the occasional bang of a firecracker added to tensions as counter-protesters, separated from the PEGIDA crowd by police, chanted Nazis raus.
The populist right-wing Alternative for Germany party, which polls show as having 10 percent support ahead of state elections this year, claimed the violence gave a taste of the looming collapse of culture and civilisation.
Playing on popular fears about Europe's migrant influx, the mob violence threatens to cloud what had been a broadly welcoming mood in Germany where crowds cheered as Syrian refugees arrived by train in September.
Cologne has changed everything, people now are doubting, said Volker Bouffier, vice president of Merkel's CDU party.
Details remain hazy of what happened in the frenzied crush on what was supposed to be a night of New Year's celebration.
It was unclear how many of the suspects had been in Germany long-term or belonged to a scene of drug dealers and pickpockets known to lurk around the railway station, and how many were newly-arrived asylum seekers.
On Friday, the interior ministry said Germany's federal police had identified 32 suspects, 22 of whom were asylum seekers, in connection with 76 offences, 12 of which had a sexual nature.
Merkel has so far refused to abandon her welcoming stance towards war refugees but on Saturday had tough words for law breakers. If a refugee flouts the rules, then there must be consequences, that means that they can lose their residence right here regardless of whether they have a suspended sentence or a prison sentence, she said after a meeting with the top ranks of her party in the southwestern city of Mainz.
Under current laws, asylum seekers are only deported if they have been sentenced to jail terms of at least three years, and if their lives are not at risk in their countries of origin.

New footage captures the moment police force bellowing fan out of Eden Park
Seven people were removed from Eden Park during yesterday's T20 against Sri Lanka over "alcohol management and misconduct issues", Eden Park Trust CEO Guy Ngata has confirmed.
The stadium spokesman was responding to a public backlash over the eviction of Sri Lankan fans during the game.
Mr Ngata said the removal of fans from the game was for "reasons of safety".
"Eden Park's priority is to ensure everyone has the opportunity to enjoy the game," Mr Ngata said in a statement.

"Eden Park reserves the right to ask patrons to leave if they are consuming alcohol not purchased at the ground or are intoxicated."
Their response came as new footage surfaced on Facebook of the moment a Sri Lankan cricket fan was forced out of Eden Park.
Security at the T20 has come under fire from cricket fans appalled by what's being described as "heavy-handed" security.
The new footage shows one fan bellowing as two police officers carry him out of the stadium.
The man yells "my knee, my knee", either in pain or protesting over the way the officers were handling him.
Members of the crowd can be heard jeering at the police officers.
Following the incident, Eden Park's Facebook page was bombed with several comments about the conduct of security guards.
James Creighton said, "too bad the Sri Lankans can't see it, because you kicked all of them out".
Imker Swanepoel commented on a post saying, "gotta say Eden Park, you really know how to make your customers hate you. Well done".
Sri Lankan fans were ejected early in the first innings, allegedly for smuggling in alcohol and instruments.
But fans say they were unfairly targeted for using drums at the stadium.

"It was just joyful fun-making, what makes a day like the T20 great. The security came it and it kept escalating things," spectator John Holley told ONE News.
"It ends up making the thing a very - dare I say it - beige event."

Russia blocks transit of Ukrainian goods: Kiev
UKRAINE: Russia has blocked the transit of Ukrainian goods heading to other countries, Kiev officials said Saturday after the two neighbouring nations imposed food embargoes in their mutual trade war.
"The transit of Ukrainian goods has not yet begun", having been blocked since the start of the new year, the spokeswoman for Ukraine's infrastructure ministry, Kristina Nikolayeva, told AFP.
The ministry said that since January 1, under new Russian regulations, Ukrainian goods headed for Central Asia or China can only enter Russia via Belarus. They must also be sealed to prevent them fro m being unloaded in Russia.
A Russian embargo on Ukrainian food imports took effect on January 1, with Kiev issuing mirror sanctions in response.
Moscow has also barred Ukraine from a free trade zone linking numerous ex-Soviet countries.
Russia introduced the latest measures on transit of goods without explaining how they should be implemented, with officials absent during public holidays lasting until Monday, said Nikolayeva.
"They brought in these transit rules but didn't prepare a mechanism for how exactly this will work: what kind of seals are needed, what kind of control measures are needed. As a result Russia is not letting Ukrainian trucks across its border," she said.
At present, "we are recommending our carriers not to send anything in that direction," Nikolayeva added.
Ukraine's trade representative Natalia Mykolska has complained that the transit problem is holding up trade with partners such as Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan and Mongolia.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Wednesday discussed the problem with his Kazakh counterpart Karim Massimov, the government press service said. Yatsenyuk said he would inform the World Trade Organisation of the "unlawful actions of the Russian Federation regarding the transit of Ukrainian goods" and would ask the global trade body to "respond to such actions."
Kiev meanwhile is seeking alternative transit routes for its goods that bypass Russia.
Ukraine intends to ship a test delivery to China on Friday across the Black Sea and then via Georgia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, the infrastructure ministry said.
Russia and Ukraine are experiencing an unprecedented crisis in relations after a pro-Western government took power in Ukraine in 2014 followed by Russia's annexation of Crimea and the conflict with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.- AFP

Colin Munro records second fastest 50 off 14 balls
Sri Lanka lose T20 series and top ranking
AUCKLAND, Sunday - New Zealand blitzed the second Twenty20 against Sri Lanka in Auckland on Sunday with a whirlwind display by Martin Guptill and Colin Munro to set up a nine-wicket win.
Munro brought up the winning runs with a six to be unbeaten on 50 after 14 balls, the second fastest Twenty20 half-century behind a 12-ball spree by India's Yuvraj Singh against England in 2007.
It was also the fastest 50 by a New Zealander, eclipsing the 20-minute-old record set by Guptill who took 19 balls to get there at the top of the innings.
Guptill was the only wicket to fall in the New Zealand innings, out for 63 off 25 balls with six fours and five sixes, while Munro clouted seven sixes and one four.
It took New Zealand exactly 10 overs to mow down the modest 143-run target with Kane Williamson unbeaten on 32.
New Zealand captain Williamson said it was "pretty special" to see Guptill and Munro flay the bowling.
"I thought it would be a bit of a scrap on that wicket as it was holding up a fraction, but it didn't seem to be a problem for those two guys and they cleared the ropes consistently," he said.
"It was exciting to see."
The victory gave New Zealand a clean sweep of the tour by Sri Lanka, winning the Twenty20s 2-0 to go with their 2-0 domination of the Tests and 3-1 win in the one-dayers.
Bad batting
Sri Lanka's resounding defeat in the Twenty20 matches saw them slip from first to third behind the West Indies and Australia in the world rankings.
As has happened throughout the tour, the Sri Lankan top order failed to click. After being sent in to bat, they were restricted to 142 for 8 with only Angelo Mathews showing any resistance with an unbeaten 81.
It was Mathews' highest score in the shortest form of the game, easily eclipsing his previous best of 58 against England five years ago.
Tillakaratne Dilshan with 28 was the only other Sri Lankan to reach double figures as the wickets tumbled.
Sri Lanka's downfall was as much a result of poor shot execution -- repeated ill-timed slogs -- as it was good bowling and fielding by New Zealand.
"We just played bad batting out there," Sri Lanka skipper Dinesh Chandimal said.
"Thanks to Angelo he put a comfortable total at the end, but I'm really disappointed with the way we played."
The chief destroyer for New Zealand was Grant Elliott with four for 22 in his first game back at Eden Park since his six off the penultimate ball against South Africa to get New Zealand into the World Cup final last year.
Adam Milne and Mitchell Santner, who replaced Matt Henry and Ish Sodhi in the New Zealand line up, took two wickets apiece.
Faced with an undemanding target, Guptill and Williamson starting in rollicking form. The 50 came up in 22 deliveries and the 100 in 43.

Two dead as firefighters battle huge Australia bushfire
AUSTRALIA: Two people have died and more than a hundred homes have been destroyed in a huge bushfire, Australian authorities said Sunday, as firefighters battled to tame the out-of-control blaze.
The inferno -- which has razed about 71,000 hectares (175,000 acres) in Western Australia state -- is the most recent in a series of bushfires that have kicked off a hot summer season, with the latest deaths lifting the national toll to eight.
The two bodies were found in burnt-out houses in Yarloop, a historic mill town some 110 kilometres (70 miles) south of Perth that has been devastated by the bushfire -- one of the worst to hit the region in recent years.
The bodies are believed to be those of two missing men aged 73 and 77, Western Australia Police told AFP.
"It's just another day of catastrophe, isn't it" local shire president Tania Jackson told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation after news of the men's deaths.
"Each day that has gone by seems to bring worse news. It's devastating."
The bushfire -- which is entering its fifth day after reportedly being started by a lightning strike -- has destroyed 143 properties including 128 homes in Yarloop, the state's Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) told AFP.
The blaze has a perimeter of about 226 kilometres and has yet to be contained, but the 250 firefighters battling the flames were hoping to take advantage of the cooler weather on Sunday.
"Overnight and today, favourable conditions came in and it's a lot cooler here today and that has allowed firefighters to gain more ground on the fire and to increase containment lines," a DFES spokeswoman told AFP. DFES said several towns in the region remained under threat.
"Unless you are ready and prepared to actively defend your property, evacuate to the south via the South Western Highway if safe to do so," it said in an emergency warning.
"The fire remains uncontained and is not yet controlled." Western Australia's Premier Colin Barnett said the event had been declared a natural disaster, a measure that gives residents access to greater financial support, adding that the "damage bill is going to be very significant".
