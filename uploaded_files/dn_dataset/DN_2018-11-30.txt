General Election only way out of impasse
All political parties should agree to hold a General Election and let the peoples sovereignty prevail, Anunayake of the Malwatte Chapter, Ven. Niyangoda Vijithasiri Thera said.
He said holding a General Election at the earliest is the best option to overcome the current political impasse.
Ven. Vijithasiri Thera was speaking at the first national convention of the Peoples Movement for a General Election, held on Wednesday at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute, Colombo.
The Anunayake Thera also said the current political imbroglio has taken the country on the wrong path and reiterated that a General Election was the only option out of the current crisis.
Expressing his views, General Secretary of Asgiriya Chapter, Most Ven. Medagama Dhammananda Thera said they had joined together to demand a general election to elect a stable government. It is the most important thing at this moment, not who would be Prime Minister, the Ven. Thera said.
We should elect people who really love this country and whose policies are friendly to the country. For that, we need a general election, he said.
Speaking at the convention, Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera said they are demanding a General Election as Parliamentary power is not implemented properly at present. Now the crisis of Parliament has gone to the Supreme Court. It is the responsibility of the Court to protect the law as well as the people of the country, he said.
The Ven. Thera said a General Election is the only option for the confusion people are facing due to the existing clash between the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary.
For this election, we, as the Maha Sangha are in discussion to take over the responsibility of selecting proper politicians.
We will present a series of resolutions and support those who agree to follow it, the Ven. Thera said.
We are demanding a general election to elect a suitable government for this country, not to crown any particular person, he said.
The President of the national movement Yuthukama, Gevindu Kumaratunga said the present Parliament no longer has a valid mandate due to several reasons.
They are the results of the last Local Government election, the economic crisis, the resignation of the UPFA from the Unity Government, and the lack of a simple majority for any party in Parliament.
When no one has a majority, they have to listen to the voice of the minor parties. We cannot allow the separatists to control this country. Therefore, we request a general election to elect a new government, Kumaratunga said.
Presidents Counsel Manohara De Silva, Prof. Premalal De Silva, Jagath Wickremesinghe, Anupa Pasqual and several others addressed the occasion.
Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, politicians, artistes, and supporters of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna participated in the convention.

Cargills Quality Dairies affirms  commitment to SL dairy industry
Cargills Quality Dairies (Pvt) Ltd, a subsidiary of Cargills Group, affirmed its commitment to the Sri Lankan dairy industry by continuously investing in the most advanced dairy facilities in the country.
Our dairy business, driven by Kotmale and Magic brands, is underpinned by a philosophy that aims to strengthen farming communities. Through such investments, we are honoured not only to contribute to Sri Lankas self-sufficiency in fresh milk, but also towards the health and nourishment of her people.
Operating out of world class production facilities, our dairy manufacturing plant boasts state-of-the-art technology, robust environmental management processes, and ISO certification for quality and food safety. This has allowed us to place quality and innovation at the forefront of our business, translating best practice into success, including market leadership in the dairy ice cream category.
Supplementing an unwavering commitment to quality and innovation, Cargills is dedicated to uplifting the lives and livelihoods of our network of thousands of dairy farmers across 5 provinces: Central, North Western, North Central, Western, and Northern. Convinced that an empowered dairy force is central to sustaining the dairy industry, Cargills has, for instance, assured its farmers of a steady income through the purchase of fresh milk, and supported the education of their children through Cargills Sarubima program. In fact, Cargills commitment to the local dairy industry extends even beyond its own ecosystem. When farmers outside the Cargills network in Ridiyagama in the Southern Provincewere unable to sell their milk, for instance, Cargills stepped up to purchase large amounts of the surplus, towards cushioning negative fall-back on the industry.
Embracing this commitment, Kotmale and Magic aspire to be the most trusted dairy brands in the country. Over several years, the brands have won mass appeal for a distinctive product range which includes fresh and flavoured milk, ice cream, set and stirred yoghurt, drinking yoghurt, cheese, and fresh cream. Each of these products have been consistently defined by nutrition, freshness, and affordability. Further, by ensuring that our products are locally-sourced, the business recognizes the important role it plays in supporting the Sri Lankan economybe it in uplifting Sri Lankan farmers, or in saving foreign exchange. It is this deep sense of responsibility that guides and drives our business.
Against this backdrop, Kotmale takes great pride in introducing its latest products: Kotmale Butter and Kotmale Cheddar Cheese. Through these products, we assure our valued customers of the highest standards of quality, freshness, and nutrition that have now grown synonymous with our brand. Defining features of Kotmale Butter and Kotmale Cheddar Cheese include:
It is, therefore, with much excitement that we invite you to be a part of this product launch today. We recognize that our achievements would not have been possible without your invaluable support. You carry our vision and commitment to the public and are, thus, critical partners in promoting and supporting the lives and livelihoods of farmers, the health and nutrition of consumers, and the strength of the Sri Lankan economy. For this we remain truly grateful.
As we continue to strive to bring you the best of Sri Lankan dairy, we encourage you to experience our butter and cheddar cheese. Products that stand as testament to our trusted and uncompromised quality; products that support Sri Lankan dairy.

India is fastest growing  e-commerce market
India has the fastest growing online retail market among top global economies. The countrys online retail market witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 53% for the period 2013 to 2017, according to a latest report by consultancy firm Bain & Company.
The rapid growth, albeit over a small base, has been driven by aggressive discount-driven e-commerce marketplaces, advances in delivery infrastructure and increased smartphone penetration and data usage.
These conditions are giving rise to large retail ecosystems. What were seeing is the emergence of scale open retail ecosystem platforms across the Asia Pacific region that offer retailers a compelling alternative to building and scaling their own capabilities, said Melanie Sanders, partner at Bain & Company.
Retail ecosystems comprise communities of consumers, retailers and partners that rapidly reshape the retail landscape. They deliver a very sticky consumer proposition by combining services like e-commerce, chat, streaming, gaming or payments in a single platform or app, which shoppers are adopting globally, the report said.
While Alibaba and Tencent lead the best-known Asian ecosystems, India too is witnessing the emergence of retail eco-systems, led by Reliance, Flipkart/Walmart, Amazon/Future Group and Alibaba.
Indias total e-commerce retail sales in 2017 were pegged at around $20 billion and studies have indicated that another $50 billion of online e-commerce could be unlocked by adding new users and luring back internet users that do not currently shop online due to various reasons.
Despite the rapid growth, online retail penetration in India is low at 5% compared with markets such as China (20%) and the US (12%). India was ranked eighth in terms of online retail penetration among 11 countries. Consumer electronics segment in India has the highest online penetration (17%, which is e-commerce sales as percentage of total retail sales) followed by apparel and footwear (9%) and beauty and personal care (1%). Food & grocery, with overall retail sales of around $530 billion in 2017, has one of the lowest online penetrations at 0.1%.

The Intellectual Patriotic Front yesterday said the people should be given an opportunity to express their opinion in a General Election to solve present Constitutional impasse.
The organisation said the time has come for the people to decide whether the government allegedly involved in corruption and treason should continue or not.
The Intellectual Patriotic Front comprising professionals representing various streams said that the previous government betrayed the country by co-sponsoring resolutions against the country and signing trade pacts with foreign countries which are detrimental to the country .
Parliament should give an opportunity to the people to elect people committed to serve the country expecting nothing in return, they said
According to the President of the organization, Dr. Ramya Premaratne, the country is facing a deterioration in terms of economy, social cultural values due to the policies of the United National Party led previous government.
The people of the country were shouldering heavy tax burden while Parliamentarians were enjoying all the perks and privileges including duty free vehicles, she said.
Dr.Premaratne said the President must be accountable to the people as he was elected by the people. The sovereinity of the republic is in the people and that is inalienable. She urged the President to do away with the clauses in the 19th Amendment that states the President of the republic cannot dissolve Parliament until it complete 4 and half years.
The President must be given the power to make a decision with regard to the government if it is heading for anarchy. He cannot wait until the government ruins the country and its assets, she said.
Consultant Physician, President of the Association Success and Deputy President of the Temperance Movement Professor Anula Wijesundera said the country is not stable in terms of economy and politics.
Professionals are highly disappointed over what is happening in the country. Some professionals are contemplating to leave the country in search of greener pastures. But we dont think that we should leave the country due to the present situation in the country.
She said many professionals who ascended the top rung of their careers using free education dont leave this country and they want to serve their motherland and ensure better future for the posterity.
Sri Lanka recorded the highest number of professionals leaving the country seeking greener pastures in 2012, she said.
Professor Wijesundera added that 27.5 per cent professionals in the country had left the country in 2012 and it is the highest per centage when compared to Bangladesh and India. Over 6000 professionals leave country in search of better opportunities annually.

J&J to introduce more brands  in China opening-up
US healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson, owner of brands such as Neutrogena, Listerine and Band-Aid, is planning to bring dozens more of its products and technologies to China, after being encouraged by the country's recent opening-up and backing of science.
We believe that China will see the establishment of an innovative life sciences ecosystem. This will be a key driving force behind China's efforts to lead the world toward a healthier future, said Vladimir Makatsaria, chairman of J&J China.
We are also seeing an increasing diversification of market demands for healthcare. These major changes will accelerate innovation and reshape the entire healthcare industry over the next 20 to 30 years, he added.
The firm was one of the first foreign pioneers to enter China in the 1980's, when it set up the joint venture Xi'an-Janssen Pharmaceutical Ltd. Today, the New-Jersey-headquartered firm has nine manufacturing plants in China, with two more in the pipeline. Its China offices are staffed by over 10,000 people, including 700 scientists focused on research and development.
In 2008, the firm took over China's homegrown skincare brand Dabao. Motivated by opening-up, it now aims even more involvement in the local market, with some 30 of its overseas products scheduled to be introduced into China over the next twelve months.
This (the speed to introduce new products) has greatly benefited from the increasing openness and favorable policies China has adopted for import business in recent years, said Xie Bing, president of J&J China Consumer sector.
From cross-border trade, to free trade zones, and the China International Import Expo ... what we see as a foreign company is a more and more open market in China. It not only means simplified procedures and efficiency, but actually boosted business, she added.
One brand to benefit from the streamlined measures is Japanese skincare brand Dr Ci:Labo, which J&J bought in 2016 and planned to introduce globally. It took the company less than four months, down from one to two years, to complete all the registration procedures before it hit Chinese shelves mid-2017.
As a result, one of the brand's best-selling lotions saw sales of 300,000 bottles in just six months after launching on China's e-commerce platform Tmall, and upwards of 70,000 bottles on the day of June 18, China's mid-year shopping spree.
While the company would not disclose revenue or growth rate by market or region, Xie noted that the consumer sector alone has been enjoying high double digit growth in China, one of the company's top five markets globally, in 2017 and 2018.

If political anticlimax not resolved
Lanka can become uncompetitive  in the eyes of investors - FTZMA
Sri Lanka will become uncompetitive and undesirable in the eyes of present and future investors which ultimately affect all constituents of the nation, a statement issued by the Free Trade Zone Manufacturers Association (FTZMA) Executive Committee states.
FIZMA therefore urges all in authority to put an end to this political anticlimax and work with and support the private sector to further develop the country.
Excerpts of the statement. Since the crisis started on the October 26, we have had many concerned inquiries from our customers and other stakeholders both local and international regarding the present political situation in the country.
The image portrayed especially in the west has been extremely negative both in the print as well as digital media.
This has had implications for most of the future order books of our members.
While it important to preserve the sovereignty of our country, we must also accept the fact that we are operating on a global platform which is highly interconnected and transparent to our end customers and consumers.
Upholding the Constitution, law and order, consistent policy making, and political and economic stability are key to growing our businesses and attracting further FDI (Foreign Direct Investment). We are extremely disturbed and disappointed with the behavior of all political parties concerned in not reaching a consensus to this political flux. It is important and urgent that all political leaders at loggerhead put the country first.
FIZMA is one of the largest manufacturing associations representing Katunayake, the largest free trade zone in the country. The zone employs roughly 45,000 workers and has over 52+ organizations which operate over 80 plants within the zone.
The membership is made up of mainly large multinational companies with principals from the US, UK, EU and other countries.

Material to be supplied directly to children
School uniform material will be supplied directly to children from next year instead of the earlier system of providing a stamp for them to purchase it from textile dealers.
The Education and Higher Education Ministry is making arrangements to supply the material before the end of February next year as directed by the Minister, a Ministry statement said.
The Ministry has decided to change over to the system of distributing uniform material directly to children in keeping with a policy decision approved by the Cabinet on November 22, the statement said.
This decision was taken to overcome many discrepancies which occurred during the programme of distributing stamps which was introduced from 2016. Among them was that the Ministry had to spend an additional Rs. 550 million in 2018.
Although material was purchased from local producers though open tenders earlier, the system of stamps involved the drain of over Rs. 1 billion to foreign countries for purchase of material. Since material had not been purchased from local producers for the last three years, local industries faced imminent closure causing loss of employment to a large number of workers. Printing of stamps also involved an additional expenditure of Rs. 10 million.
Previously, high-quality uniform material was distributed after subjecting stocks to quality tests, but most of the material supplied to students by businessmen under the stamp system was of low quality.
Furthermore, parents had to waste time and bear additional costs to purchase material under the stamp system.

Motion to cut PMs funds sub judice
Parliament has no power to debate the motion seeking to cut budgetary allocations to the Prime Ministers Office as the matter is already adjudicated in the Court, Dinesh Gunawardena said yesterday.
This matter is being adjudicated in Court following a writ application filed by Wickremesinghe and other UNP MPs. The motion given by UNF and JVP is on the basis that they say that there is no government.The Court will examine and give its decision whether the application can be sustained or not. Parliament has no power to debate a motion which is under adjudication, Gunawardena said.
It is illegal to do so.Therefore we cannot participate in such an illegal session. On the contrary this motion is illegal as well. It is against the Constitution, the Standing Orders and this is why we are not participating in the session, Gunawardena explained.
We met the Speaker today and requested him to act according to the Constitution and the Standing Orders.We pointed out to him of its illegality. The case filed before Court with regard to the expenses of the Prime Minister is to be taken up on Friday. We are ready to present our case then. It is incorrect to debate on a subject that is before Court. We requested the Speaker to respect that. But he refused, Gunawardena said.
The UPFA MPs also said that they did not attend Parliamentary session yesterday considering the illegal and undemocratic manner in which the proceedings were conducted. Speaking at a press brief UPFA ministers including Dinesh Gunawardena, Nimal Siripala de Silva, Mahinda Samarasinghe, Susil Premajayantha and Wimal Weerawansa were present at the press briefing held at the Parliamentary premises yesterday morning.
Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said the Speaker was acting like a dictator. No Speaker in the world has acted stubbornly as has done by Speaker Jayasuriya.
Speaker is leaving a black mark on Sri Lankan history and parliament history. Usually before a motion is moved, it is brought before a Party Leaders Meeting. It should be included in the Order Paper. None of this has happened, de Silva observed.
Minister Weerawansa speaking at the briefing accused some UNF MPs for trying to impose pressure on crucial legal decisions to be taken with regards to the present crisis.
The UNP are promoting fake democracy. We are ready to accept whatever the order given by the Supreme Court. We shall not allow this fake motion passed in the House by a UNP assembly. We urge the government servants not to be affected by these dramas. We request everyone to make this Maithri-Mahinda coalition a success, Weerawansa further said.
Susil Premajayantha speaking to the media pointed out that the Speaker has summoned the Selection Committee of the Seventh Parliament instead of summoning the newly appointed SC of the Eighth Parliament.
He also pointed out that Speaker Jayasuriya has taken legal advice not from the Attorney General but from private lawyers. Premajayantha also said that the government officers do not need to abide by a motion passed illegally in Parliament.
The Speaker is presiding over a Parliament where the ruling party refuses to attend. So we will have to consider the expenditure of these sessions in the future as well, he added.

One million jackfruit saplings to be planted
The Agriculture Ministry has launched an island-wide jackfruit and coconut sapling-planting project under the governments Api Wawalai, Api Kanne food-production drive.
The Agriculture and the Agrarian Development Departments, the Hadabima Authority, and the National Food Promotion Board had implemented the project under the instructions of Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera. It has been targetted to plant 1,000,000 jackfruit saplings at agrarian development centres, as well as coconut saplings in a land spanning 1,000 acres. Referring to the issue, Minister Amaraweera told the Daily News that the coconut industry was dwindling due to land fragmentation.
Under the circumstances, it had been feared that in future, the countrys coconut requirement would have to be acquired through imports, he added.
We have been setting up agricultural crops zones to ensure long-term food security; two mango export crops zones in 400-acre lands in Matale and Angunakolapelessa, cucumber in a 500-acre land in Batticaloa, a 200-acre groundnut cultivation in Mullativu, 16,000-acre undu cultivation inVavuniya, 30-acre papaw cultivation in Polonnaruwa, 37-acre passion fruit cultivation, as well as a 37-acre pineapple cultivation in Moneragala; in order to develop the export market, Minister Amaraweera added.
He said that in 2017, the contribution of the agriculture sector to the gross national production, had dropped to 7.7 percent. Meanwhile, it had been said at the annual Anuradhapura Agriculture Committee meeting, that plans were under way to plant 35,000 jackfruit plants in Anuradhapura under the auspices of the Agrarian Development Department and the Hadabima Authority.

Parliament bars PMs Secretary drawing funds
A motion prohibiting the Secretary to the Prime Minister from approving any expenditure drawn from the funds of the Republic was passed with 123 votes in favour and none against in Parliament yesterday while the UPFA MPs boycotted sittings.
The motion signed by six UNP MPs was presented to the House by UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake.
It stated that from November 15, the Secretary to the Prime Minister has no authority to approve any expenditure drawn from the funds of the Republic, and any person taking any action in violation of this Resolution will be dealt with according to the law. UNP MP Navin Dissanayake seconded the motion.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, at the outset of the sittings, permitted moving the motion ruling out it being sub judice as per the advice of legal experts.
The Speaker then opened the floor for members to speak.
Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, the only member present in the House to represent the Government, made a lengthy speech on the developments that led to the current political impasse. He urged the Speaker to discuss with President Maithripala Sirisena to reconcile the both parties who are at loggerheads and find an amicable solution to the constitutional crisis which had put the country in peril. He asked to temporarily halt passing the motion in an effort to resolve the matter through negotiations.
MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who immediately spoke after Rajapakshe, stated that the JVP was firm that there can be no negotiations with President Sirisena.
This was a premeditated conspiracy of the President in which he blatantly and deliberately violated the Constitution. Our attempt is to make the President act in line with the Constitution. When the first citizen of the country disobeys the rules and laws, how can one expect the ordinary public to respect those laws he questioned.
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake, making a fiery speech, hit hard at the MPs who were performing somersaults in the House and rebuked the UNP for placidly accepting them back in their group.
The UNP needs a Kumara Welgama in its group to speak straight that they cannot sit together with betrayers in a Government in future, he said. He also proposed appointing two Parliament select committees once the dust settled on the current political crisis, one to study how the countrys laws were breached during that period and the other to assess the economic damage to the country from it.
MPs Rauf Hakeem and Dr.Rajitha Senaratne expressed their willingness for negotiations as suggested by Dr Rajapakshe. If you are raising a white flag, we earnestly look forward to it. We are more concerned of what is right than who the individuals behind it are. The country is in a huge crisis and the innocent people should not suffer as a result of it. We appreciate the self-confidence and backbone of the Speaker and his name will be written in gold in the countrys history.
The Speaker may talk to the President immediately to come to a settlement and if the President is not ready for any settlement we pledge to fight this battle to the end, Dr Senaratne noted.
Ven.Athuraliye Rathana thera also spoke in favour of negotiations between the Speaker and the President. Thereafter the Speaker placed the motion before the House and a vote was taken using the e-vote system around 12.15pm. Dr Rajapakshe and Ven. Rathana Thera left the House as the quorum bell was rung.
TNA MP Sivasakthi Ananthan was absent. The motion was carried with 123 MPs, including MPs Wasantha Senananayake and Vadivel Suresh, voting in favour of it. The Speaker then adjourned the sittings till 10.30am today. A motion to cut the expenditure of ministers is to be taken up today.

Six member Parliamentary Committee to probe unruly incidents
Parliament yesterday appointed a six-member Special Parliamentary Committee headed by Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri to investigate the unruly incidents in the Chamber on November 14, 15 and 16.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya at the commencement of the sittings announced that MPs Chamal Rajapaksa, Bimal Ratnayake, Mavai Senadhiraja, Ranjith Maddumabandara and Chandrasiri Gajadheera have been appointed as the members of the committee.
He requested the committee to furnish their report as soon as possible.
The Police are already conducting an investigation on those incidents. This committee will carry out an internal investigation, he said.
The Speaker said that he decided to summon the Police into the Chamber to ensure the protection of all the MPs following the clashes that erupted in the Chamber on November 14, 15 and 16.
I had no choice but to summon the Police to ensure the protection of all the MPs. If the MPs can give an assurance that the Chamber and corridors near the Chamber are safe, I can withdraw additional police personnel in Parliament, he said.
Sajith calls on UPFA to step down
UNP Deputy Leader MP Sajith Premadasa yesterday called on the UPFA to step down and let the party that commands the majority of the House take over the government to end the constitutional crisis.
He was addressing a press conference at the Parliament complex yesterday.
Premadasa said that President Maithripala Sirisena offered him the post of Prime Minister 10 times, but that he turned the offer down on every occasion.
I thank the President for the confidence shown in me, but there is a legal and constitutional procedure in appointing a Prime Minister. No one can circumvent that, he said.
MP Premadasa agreed with MPs Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and Ven. Rathana Thera in the House that an individual who commands the majority support must be appointed as the PM.
MP Premadasa, observing that the UPFA had already been defeated four times in the House, predicted the fifth defeat in Parliament today.
They dont have at least 85 lawmakers to support them in Parliament. The purported government violated the Constitution for over 30 days. With todays motion, it is time they face the reality and step down to make room for the Constitution to take its course, MP Premadasa said.
We hope that sanity will prevail, all along we have followed the relevant and exquisite constitutional provisions to express our opinion. At many times, we have shown our majority on the floor of the House. This is something the President cannot ignore, he said.

PDB wind power costs 70% higher than private  producers
The Power Development Board (PDB) is spending Tk420 million for a 2-megawatt wind power project, for which the per-unit production cost is Tk16.
On the other hand, an Indian company called Siddhanth Wind Energy Private Ltd was recently approved to build a 30-megawatt private wind power project in Sonagaji, Feni for which the per-unit production cost is Tk9.49.
This shows that for every unit, government producers are spending Tk6.51 more than private producers.
Former Director General of Power Cell BD Rahmatullah said: The wind turbines of the Netherlands are the best. One megawatt turbine costs Tk80 million-Tk85 million. Combined with other costs, the price of the whole project should not exceed more than Tk100 million.
Talking about the PDB's Tk420 million project, Rahmatullah said: The roads in our country are constructed at twice the cost. It should come as no surprise if wind power projects follow the same rule. Concerned authorities say, from the very beginning, Bangladesh has been spending extra money on renewable energy production by showcasing it as a new sector. Government producers have been taking advantage of this, making it nearly impossible for renewable energy production to come at a low cost.
The per-unit cost for solar energy production started at 17-19 cents, which later reduced to 10 cents over three years. If the government had taken the initiative to produce renewable energy at a lower cost, others would have taken it as an exampleexperts think.
However, the current situation is the oppositewith government institutions producing energy at a higher cost, the overall price of electricity is on the rise.
A Power Division official said: Wind power can be produced if the wind velocity is 2.3-2.5m/secwhich in-turn increases per-unit cost. However, if energy is produced using 5-6m/sec, then wind power production can be done profitably.
With the introduction of modern technology, a single turbine can produce 6-megawatts of electricity. In the coastal areas of Bangladesh, the wind velocity stays at 5-6m/sec, which can be used to produce wind power quite easily, experts think, said the official.
However, the wind power sector is now at risk due to the increased cost of wind power production.
Manager of Renewable Energy sector of the PDB Eng Nazmul Haque said: We hope our wind power project will start producing from next December. Four turbines capable of producing 500-kilowatt energy will be ready.
The PDB will spend Tk420 million to establish this project, he said. The per-unit cost will be Tk16.
He added: Windmills are being erected on the Sirajganj side of Jamuna Bridge. With that end in mind, we have already leased lands from the Water Development Board. (Dhaka Tribune)

Political crisis must be solved democratically - CBEU
The country can never be steered on the correct path until the political crisis which has destabilised the country is solved through a democratic framework, the Ceylon Bank Employees Union (CBEU) said in a statement.
For that to happen the security of the Executive, Legislature, Judiciary and peoples sovereignty should be protected. Without doing this, the rulers seem to behave like actors in a tragicomedy, the statement said.
The statement signed by CBEU General Secretary Ranjan Senanayake said there were several issues which adversely affected the countrys economy regarding which no political party had stated its stand. They were the privatisation of state assets including state banks, the draconian tax policy, white paper to destroy EPF, the adverse Singapore FTA and the employment programme.
No government party had so far pledged to do away with these programmes. As such, the Ceylon Bank Employees Union which had no truck with any political party planned to launch an unrelenting campaign against these programmes.
As part of this programme, the CBEU has launched a series of seminars at provincial level themed Rata Koibatada in an effort to drive the local economy in the correct direction.

The water level of Moragahakands reservoir has reached almost to the brim. The President is due to conduct an inspection tour of Moragahakanda-Kaluganga Project after the opening of the sluice gates.
The Moragahakanda-Kaluganga Project, which is a major component of Mahaweli Master Plan has been restricted only to plans for around four decades. President Sirisena has seen the completion on the work of the Main Dam, the Saddle Dam and other major components of the project.
The project is hailed as the 21st centurys irrigation wonder of Sri Lanka. It is set to give support for over 1.5 million agricultural families.
The reservoir is expected to irrigate over 82 000 hectares of farm lands in the dry zone. It will generate 25 MW hydro-powers to the national grid.
The Moragahakanda-Kaluganga Project is envisioned to supply clean drinking water and industrial water to the people of the dry zone areas of the North Central, North-western and Northern Provinces. It will open up 5000 hectares of new land for agriculture development in Northern, North Central, Eastern and North Western provinces.
The project was revived for construction in 2007 by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa as the then President. President Maithripala Sirisena hastened the project in 2015 who took a special interest in the project.
Besides its contributions to development of agriculture, the project seeks to increase inland fish production. Eco tourism and effective flood control are its other targets.

Ranil should quit Temple Trees - jvp
If the UNP is genuine in bringing the motion to cut the expenditure of the Secretary to the Prime Minister to prevent a misuse of public funds, former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should also leave Temple Trees immediately after the passage of the motion, JVP Leader MP Anura Dissanyake said.
Speaking in Parliament yesterday, he pointed out neither former President Mahinda Rajapaksa nor Wickremesinghe has the right to enjoy the privileges of a PM in a context where there is no Government in the country.
Yesterday (Wednesday) all members of Local Government bodies were summoned to the main hall of Temple Trees. This meeting should have been taken place at Sirikotha. Who pays for electricity bill and hall charges of Temple Trees The tax payers have to bear the burden of two Prime Ministers now. Former President Rajapaksa is also only entitled to the privileges of an MP. But he in vain tries to show that he is the PM and uses public money for that show. That is why we support this motion to stop state funds being used by the PMs Secretary, he added.
UNP MP Lakshman Kiriella replied that the cost for Wednesdays meeting at Temple Trees including the electricity bill is being borne privately by the UNP and its supporters. At this point, MP Dissanayake asked whether Temple Trees has become a hotel to be hired by any individual and Kiriella replied that Temple Trees would be made available for the JVP too if needed.
Rauf Hakeem taking the floor contended that Wickremesinghe was occupying Temple Trees because they were of the opinion that his removal should be treated as invalid from the outset. We say the decision by the President to remove Wickremesinghe is ab initio void and that matter is now before the Supreme Court through a petition. Therefore, we cannot come to the conclusion that Wickremesinghe is illegally occupying Temple Trees. Wickremesinge had always respected the verdict of the people and had honourably left the Temple Trees. Here when the Executive President has unlawfully and unconstitutionally removed the PM, it is his contention and our contention that he can remain there as a legal occupant unless the court holds the otherwise. I would dare say that we would even be willing replenish all the costs that might incur out of wrongful occupation of the Temple Trees if the court holds otherwise, Hakeem stressed.
He further said that the current Constitutional crisis was a result of not realizing that the 19th Amendment was meant to curtail the powers of the Executive President. He however welcomed Dr.Wijeyadasa Rajapakshes gesture for reconciliation and said the Speaker should consider it to end the confrontation of the two parties.

SL has become political museum - Dr. de Costa
Sri Lanka has now become a constitutional museum, with its array of electoral systems and power struggles regarding the executive and legislature, prominent political analyst, Presidents Counsel Dr. Jayatissa de Costa said .
In his broad analysis of the current political situation in the country, he noted that Sri Lanka has three organs of governance, the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary. Under the first constitution of Sri Lanka, the Soulbury Constitution, there was a clear definition of division of powers. The Executive, Legislature and Judiciary was listed separately and defined.
Sirimavo Bandaranaike who created history by becoming the Worlds First Woman Prime Minister in July 1960, won the Parliamentary Elections in 1970 contesting as the United Front formed the Government and turning the parliament into a Constituent Assembly drafted a new Republican Constitution. It was promulgated on 22 May 1972 and this Constitution provided for a unicameral legislature named the National State Assembly with a term of office of six (6) years and Sovereignty was entirely vested in it. Then J. R. Jayewardene who came to office in July 1977 with a five-sixths majority passed the second amendment to the 1972 Constitution on 4 October 1977 and he became the first Executive President of Sri Lanka on February 4, 1978.
It all changed under the J.R. Jayawardena government as he became somewhat of a dictator and the present crisis is a direct consequence of this constitution. In fact N.M. Perera predicted this a couple of weeks after this constitution at the time and today all his fears have come true, Dr. De Costa said.
Expressing his views on the issue of parliamentary majority, he noted that today in parliament the biggest single party is led by Mahinda Rajapaksa. There are around 106 members in the UNF. There are six JVP MPs, and another 14 are from the TNA. Leaving them aside, the Mahinda Rajapaksa camp has more on their side as a single party. Moreover, although many are pro UNP and anti-Mahinda, that does not necessarily mean that all of them want Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister. Therefore, this parliament can be termed as a hung parliament as no one has absolute majority. Hence, you cannot have stability, he explained.
In such a time of constitutional crisis, the country has turned to the judiciary with the hope that it would provide some consolation.
Today everyone is eagerly anticipating an independent decision from the Supreme Court on December 7 and constitutional provisions can be interpreted by the seven member bench on that day (7). That verdict will affect the present situation and the judicial decision will also affect the executive and the legislature. It will have very significant results, but as a country it is not a good stand as there is no stable government.

Softlogic stirs up new paradigm in flavour, spice with Wan Ge Di Ya
The Softlogic Groups maiden foray into the world of Asian flavours and spice with its own restaurant brand, gives Sri Lankan foodies a literal cornucopia of gastronomic variety.
Wan Ge Di Ya - inspired by the traditional stone mortarand pestle common to many Asian cuisines--offering a carefully selected range of signature street food dishes from eight Asian countries,was opened by Softlogic Chairman and Managing Director Ashok Pathirage at the Promenade at ODEL Alexandra Place. This heralds an expansion in scope for Softlogic Restaurants (Pvt) Ltd., a fully-owned subsidiary of Softlogic Holdings PLC, which is also the master franchisee in Sri Lanka for three international restaurant brands: Burger King, Baskin Robbins and Dlifrance.
Able to seat up to 80 diners at a time in a caf ambience, Wan Ge Di Yas menu is as eclectic as its kaleidoscopically colourful ceiling of 450 suspended Asian lanterns, the restaurant offers dishes from Malaysia,Hong Kong, Korea, Japan, China, Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore under one roof, providing diners the choice of experiencing one cuisine at a time, or sampling the delights of all at one sitting.
Dishes chosen by Wan Ge Di Yas Culinary Consultant  Sri Lankan born Australian celebrity chef Keerthi Hapugasdeniya (better known as Chef Happy in the culinary world), make up the authenticity-obsessed menu. Diners have the option of becoming creative not only by mixing nationalities around the table but by coming to the counter and selecting their own special mixes of desserts and juices to suit their palates. Some Asian herbs have been specially grown for Wan Ge Di Ya to ensure the dishes are as authentic as they can be.
The Softlogic Group has extensive credentials in restaurant management as the master franchisee for Burger King, Baskin-Robbins and Dlifrance, currently adding up to 27 restaurants in Sri Lanka,said Softlogic Holdings PLC Chairman, Ashok Pathirage.

Speaker, President can find solution to political crisis - Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and President Maithripala Sirisena can find a solution to the present political crisis in the country through discussions, Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said. Hence, Rajapakshe urged Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to participate in a round of discussions with the President to resolve the matter.
Dr. Rajapakshe expressed confidence that such a discussion will end the present crisis in a short period of time. Dr. Rajapakshe also said that he made the same request to President Maithripala Sirisena as well.
Dr.Rajapakshe made these observations in Parliament yesterday while participating in the session despite the UPFAs claim that they are boycotting the Parliament sessions.
Dr. Rajapakshe who positioned himself in the ruling partys side rose to speak as the UNF moved the motion prohibiting Secretary to the Prime Minister from approving any expenditure drawn from the funds of the Republic.
What we are in is a Constitutional deadlock, where the Executive and the Legislature are not in agreement. The responsibility of Parliament is to put aside political disagreements and to work towards the stability of the country. Those who have the majority in Parliament should be able to form a government, Dr. Rajapakshe said.
Dr. Rajapakshe said that as a Parliamentarian he is ready to make any sacrifice to solve the prevailing crisis in the country. He pointed out that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is very much qualified to find a solution together with President Maithripala Sirisena.
From November 14 to 16, there was a tense situation in the House. People were disappointed in the way in which the MPs acted within this Chamber. People do not have a proper awareness of the crisis situation that we are in. The President and the Legislature should find a solution to this. Judiciary does not have a say in finding a proper solution to this issue. By using the judiciary to solve this issue will only demean the powers of the Legislature. Darkness is on the horizon for our country. It wouldnt be long when the younger generation of this country totally reject this political system. There is no use in conducting postmortems as to who did what. I agree with the fact that the fraction that holds the majority in the House should be allowed to form a government, Dr. Rajapakshe said.
In 2015, we cannot forget that President Maithripala Sirisena took a revolutionary decision on behalf of this country. Many Presidents promised to cut down their Executive Powers but they did not practice it. But, President Sirisena did. He allowed many Executive Powers to be taken out. I believe that the Speaker and the President will be able to come to an understanding via discussions that will allow us to restore political balance in the country. I believe it will take only one or two days to get this matter solved, Dr. Rajapakshe also said.
In response to Dr. Rajapakshe, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said that he has no issue in speaking with the President and assured that he will take every measure to secure democracy in the country.

St. Stephens Church, Marawila: amazing grace
Consecrated in 1870 and handed over to the Diocese of Colombo by the then Bishop Claughton, this quaint little church with its imposing dome atop is one of the oldest churches in the country.
Nestled among the lush greenery, ascending towards the eastern sky when dawn appears, is the magnificent but small abode of God.
The Stephen's church stand upright though with a small Anglican community in the Roman Catholic dominated Diocese of Chilaw.
The church is shepherded by its youthful priest, Rev. Fr. Anil Wickramasinghe.
Down the years, the church has nurtured among its simple community, an Archdeacon from the clergy; among intellectuals and professionals; the first Sri Lankan envoy to the United Nations, a foreign minister, doctors, lawyers, from the corporate sector; a postgraduate from the Oxford University, writers etc. and dedicated laymen from the church.
Together, all have lived and worshipped like one family which is the strength of the church upon the resonate voice of God on all of us.
JESUS CHRIST, THE SHEPHERD
As one enters the church, it is the figure of Jesus that comes in contact at eye-level on stained glass done in myriad colour, meticulously put together as homage to the Gentle Shepherd who carries the staff in his left hand.
A great bit of art work considering the time it was created over a century and still sits well. Here, Jesus gives the impression of the Risen Lord. Either way, Jesus protects all of us, his chosen flock.
THE FONT
Primary and original, the fountain-head for baptismal, the font is as old as the church. Erected in fine timber with the baptismal well, deeply inlaid with transparent crystal of a green hue with no cracks or damage in any way to hold the holy water for Christian babies as their lives are dedicated to God by their parents.
It is a spiritual journey as the years keep moving on and as they grow up in the spirit of God.
THE CEMETERY
The cemetery or the graveyard where the spirits of the deceased rest in peace under the watchful eyes of marble angels who guard the graves, some of which holds generations in their family vaults. Few of the marble statues are classic with clear-cut features and worth a colossal sum as they are priceless today.
No one dare steal them because they are protected by the unseen hand as God abide over them.

The UPFA MPs said that they did not attend Parliamentary session yesterday considering the illegal and undemocratic manner in which the proceedings are held.
Speaking at a press brief at Parliament premises, UPFA MPs including Dinesh Gunawarena, Nimal Siripala De Silva, Mahinda Samarasinghe, Susil Premajayantha and Wimal Weerawansa made these observations yesterday morning.
Nimal Siripala de Silva speaking to the media said that the motion seeking to cut budgetary allocations to the Prime Ministers Office is not legal.
The motion given by UNF and JVP member is on the basis that there is no government. This matter is been adjudicated in the Court by a writ application by UNP MPs. Court will examine and give a decision whether the application can be sustained or not. Parliament has no power to debate a motion under adjudication, de Silva said.
This is an illegal act. We cannot participate in such an illegal session. This motion is not legal. This motion is against the Constitution, the Standing Orders and this is why we are not participating in the session. The Speaker is acting like a dictator. No Speaker in the world has acted stubbornly like Speaker Jayasuriya does. The Speaker is leaving a black mark on Sri Lankas history and parliament history. Usually before a motion is brought, it is brought before a Party Leaders Meeting. It should be included in the Order Paper. None of this has happened, de Silva observed.
Dinesh Gunawardena speaking at the press brief said; We met the Speaker today as well and requested him to act according to the Constitution and the Standing Orders. There is a case filed before the Court with regards to this. The case is to be taken up on Friday. We are to present our case then. It is not correct to debate on a subject that is before the Court. We requested the Speaker to respect that. But he refused.
Weerawansa speaking at the brief accused some UNF MPs for trying to impose pressure on crucial legal decisions to be taken with regards to the present crisis.
The UNP are promoting fake democracy. We are ready to accept whatever the order given by the Supreme Court. We shall not allow this fake motion passed in the House by a UNP assembly.We urge the government servants not to be affected by these dramas. We request everyone to make this Maithri-Mahinda coalition a success. Weerawansa further said.

We proved Sri Lanka has no government now  Ranil
Mahinda Rajapaksa was brought from the backdoor to the Prime Ministers seat to form a so-called government but we proved through Parliament that that there was no such government led by him, former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said at a meeting of UNP members of local government institutions at Temple Trees on November 28.
He said that the next day the Speaker accepted their standpoint and announced that Mahinda Rajapaksa and his team had no valid ministerial posts. The whole world saw the chaotic seen in Parliament the next day. The Sirisena-Rajapaksa clique struck a deathblow to parliamentary democracy by resorting to acts of thuggery, Wickremesinghe said.
He said the Sirisena-Rajapaksa clique had displayed their true colours that of thugs. Even the people who voted for the Photottuwa at the last local elections said they are ashamed of the behaviour of the clique in Parliament and would never vote for the Phottuwa again, Wickremesinghe said.
He said that an announcement had been made on October 26 that he had been removed from the premiership but by then, no one had sacked me from the post. Therefore, I spent that night at Temple Trees and when I woke up the next morning, I saw a large crowd assembled there to support me, he said.
It was the peoples support which enabled us to carry forward to save democracy. We are thankful to each and everyone who rallied round us and our party at this crucial moment to exhibit peoples power behind us, former Premier said.
He said that on January 8, 2015, people gave them a mandate to defeat Mahinda Rajapaksa and make Maithripala Sirisena President and make him Prime Minister. That Mandate was given to strengthen parliamentary democracy rather than to appoint anyone else as Prime Minister.
The people gave another mandate in August 2015 to reaffirm Maithripala Sirisena as President and make me Prime Minister and for the government to move forward, he said.
He said that that mandate had not changed to date but the incident on October 26 had turned that mandate upside down to hand over the country to Rajapaksa and create a dictatorial President.
Wickremesinghe said that amidst all these challenges, they had been able to show a majority in Parliament since September 2015. He would challenge the group led by the Phottuwa to display a majority in Parliament if possible.
He said the task now before them was to regain the government and continue the development activities launched for the countrys progress.
Despite some shortcomings on our part during the recent past, it had been proved that we had worked with good intentions according to public opinion. Therefore, we have no fear to go before the people at an election because our power emanates from peoples power. Now we have started work towards registering a new political alliance where all parties could work in unison and go forward. The United National Front is not a political party. That was why we planned to form a new political alliance which will provide shelter to all and act as a political mechanism protecting democracy, he said.
Wickremesinghe said they had another duty to protect Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, who acted bravely in Parliament amidst all ugly scenes created by Pohottuwa supporters.
We had now gained victory in Parliament by showing a majority with maximum strength. Therefore, people who had usurped ministry posts should now vacate those posts. If that was not done, we should all get ready to chase them out by using a Janabala Meheyuma to display the power of the people. Not only party supporters but also sections of the community belonging to all hues should be amassed to stage such a show of strength, Wickremesinghe said.
He said that until that became a reality, he would request all party supporters to conduct public awareness campaigns in every nook and corner in towns and villages and also conduct protest campaigns throughout the country until they were noticed to participate in the Janabale Meheyuma campaign.
Wicremesinghe said parliamentarian Harin Fernando has organised a new programme, Yukthiye Yatrawa, this weekend.
Under this programme, a motorcade with thousands of vehicles will drive from Colombo to Devinuwara on Saturday. The following morning, the participants would attend a deva pooja at Kataragama and conclude the programme the same evening at Mahiyangana, he said.
Wickremesinghe requested all to participate in it and display their strength.
