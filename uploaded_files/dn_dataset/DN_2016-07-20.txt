Bald Soprano looms over  again

We remember Thatta Gayikawa an adaptation of Eugne Ionescos La Cantatrice Chauve, The Bald Soprano, performed by veteran actress Deepani Silva on stage some time back. Deepani by grasping the core of the absurd drama style with perfection brought to fore a superb presentation of the character.
The new production of Thatta Gayikawa will be staged on July 29 at 3 pm and 6.45 pm at the Namel-Malini Punchi Theatre, Borella. The venue matches perfectly with the presentation style of the drama. A viewer can sit comfortably and feel at home at the Punchi Theatre to enjoy the drama.
Thatta Gayikawa this time around is directed by Kanchuka Dharmasiri and presented by the Department of Fine Arts and the Theatre of the Melting Clock. Kanchuka currently is a lecturer in English at the Peradeniya University. She is a past student of UMass Amherst in Massachusetts and an associate of New World Theatre.
La Cantatrice Chauve, the Bald Soprano Ionesco wrote in French in 1949 is regarded as one of the classical texts of the Theatre of the Absurd. Ionesco called his play an Anti-play. The Bald Soprano is both tragic and farcical. Not only does the play disrupt the linear narrative, it also questions the relationships between cause and effect. As a result, the characters do not always respond to the question being asked and often times, situations cannot be explained logically occur.
Ionesco came up with the idea of writing the play when he was learning English as an adult. He states that suddenly he realized the absurd nature of language because he was learning phrases such as the ceiling is on the top and the floor is in the bottom. Ionesco asserts he wanted to write the tragedy of language. In the end of the play, language loses all meaning and the characters hurl at each other.
The theatre of the Absurd, a theatre genre that developed after the two world wars explores a variety of issues including language and communication, human existence and the universe, isolation, the absurdity of bourgeois ethics and materialistic values. Cast of Thatta Gayikawa include Sameera Hewage, Sandamini Ranwalage, Chathurika Sachinthanie, Vidumina Ihalagedara, Madhushani Chandrasekera and Dhanushka Gunathilake.
Thatta Gayikawa is translated by Kanchuka Dharmasiri and Lohan Gunaweera. Music is composed by Manoj Alawathukotuwa, make-up is by Ranjith K Rajapaksha and sound design and stage-management are by Lahiru Prabodha.

Amaraweera wants woes of  fishermen solved at district level

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera instructed of Fisheries District Assistant Directors to solve fishing communities' issues at district level without sending them to the Fisheries Ministry or the Fisheries Department Head Office.
Distributing appointment letters among 15 District Assistant Directors of Fisheries, the minister said it is difficult for fishermen staying in far away places to travel to the Fisheries Ministry or the Fisheries Department in Colombo.
Their issues should be solved at district or regional level, he said.
"Persons spending several nights at sea need a rest during the day. If they have to come to Colombo to solve their issues, they will have no time for a rest," the minister said.
Minister Amaraweera instructed officials to build close ties with the fishing community as this will enable them to solve their issues and find solutions.
He requested the District Assistant Directors of Fisheries to contact the ministry or the Fisheries Department if there are doubts and instructed the ministerial officials to look into fishermen's issues and solve them.
The fishing community contributes to the country's economy. We should see that solutions are found to fishermen's problems," Amaraweera said.

Warnapura dislocates shoulder - out of match: Aussies in driving seat after impressive second day

The touring Australian side had every reason to be happy with their performance on the second day of their 3-day practice match against a Sri Lanka Board Presidents XI when they batted themselves into a strong position from which they can push for victory on the final day at the P Sara Oval.
Australian captain Steve Smith attempts to pull a short ball on the second day of the 3-day practice match against a Sri Lanka Board Presidents XI at the P Sara Oval yesterday. Pictures by Rukmal Gamage.

Resuming at their overnight score of 127 for one wicket Australia ended the day on 431-9 to lead the home side by 202 runs. The Board team made 229 in their first innings and face an uphill task of saving the match having to probably bat out the entire third day.
Their chances of doing that have already been handicapped by the injury to opening bat Madawa Warnapura who has been ruled out of the match with a dislocated left shoulder.
Warnapura dived at short mid wicket to try and stop a shot from Australian captain Steve Smith and in that attempt dislocated his shoulder which was later relocated.
However the local teams manager cum coach Piyal Wijetunge said that Warnapura would be out for at least three weeks and would take no further part in the match.
In Warnapuras absence, Wijetunge said that either wicket-keeper batsman Manoj Sarathchandra or Shehan Jayasuriya would open the batting with Oshada Fernando in the second innings.
Well have to see whether Manoj is fit enough to open after having kept wickets for 122 overs, otherwise our second option is to open with Shehan, said Wijetunge.
Sri Lanka cap Jayasuriya distinguished himself yesterday as a useful off-spinner picking up five Australian wickets for 109 off 29 overs. He was the pick of the home team bowlers even though there some impressive spells from quicks like Vimukthi Perera, Tharaka Gamage and Dasun Shanaka.
If at all the Aussies were unhappy about was that none of their batters went onto make a big score. Top scorer for them was opener Joe Burns with 72 while Steve Smith (57), Adam Voges (43) and later in the day Steve OKeefe (62 n.o.) and Mitchell Starc (45) helped themselves to some useful runs to boost the total beyond the 400-run mark.
The one disappointment to come out of the day was all our batters spent some time at the crease but no one went on to get a big score, said Burns at the end of the day.
We talked about as a batting group that we try and be patient for long periods on the subcontinent. If they bowl good areas its just tough work, tough to score and slow going and you have to be committed to bat all day.
I thought the opposition bowlers bowled quite well especially because it was a long day and some hot periods. As a batting group we are prepared to bat long hours in the middle. Hopefully we can bat for extended periods during the Test series, he said.
Burns who scored 72 off 131 balls said that he ready for the Test series. I felt really good the last few weeks went to Chennai before the tour had plenty of batting under my belt and I am ready to go for the Test series. Its always nice to get some match experience, transfer what you are doing in the nets to a competitive environment in a first-class game and get as much confidence as possible for the three test matches.
Burns was confident that Australia can push for a win today especially with the bowling line-up they have.
Obviously we want to come out tomorrow and try and get a win. The skills our bowlers have - quick and spin bowlers can pose a threat, said Burns.
We have a bowling attack that can pose a threat in these conditions with reverse swing or spin. Thats a chance for our group to keep posing to the opposition batters.

London Marathon  cheat told to pay 377,000

LONDON: Russias Liliya Shobukhova has been ordered to repay more than 377,000 to London Marathon organisers after being banned for doping.
The 38-year-old won the 2010 race but was later suspended for 38 months.
The judgement to recover her appearance fees and prize money for the 2010 and 2011 races needs enforcing by Russia.
Cheats should not benefit, said London Marathon Events Ltd chief Nick Bitel. It will be a long and difficult process but we will pursue it.
Ethiopian Aselefech Mergia was named the winner of the 2010 London Marathon after Shobukhova was stripped of her win. The Russian was runner-up in 2011.
Bitel said any money returned by Shobukhova will be redistributed to athletes that were cheated out of their rightful dues. Shobukhova also had her results from 2009 annulled and was also stripped of Chicago Marathon wins in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Her ban was reduced by seven months, for assisting a World Anti-Doping Agency investigation.
Shobukhova is banned for life from taking part in the London Marathon and in any of the five other marathons that make up the World Marathon Majors. BBC

One-day tri-series in England: Thumping eight-wicket win for Pakistan A

CHELTENHAM: Pakistan A romped to an eight-wicket win against Sri Lanka A in the opening game of the one-day triangular series, also involving England Lions, in Cheltenham on Monday.
Pakistan As bowlers backed Babar Azams decision to field as Sri Lanka A were dismantled for 199 in 37.5 overs. In reply, Fakhar Zaman (74) and Sharjeel Khan (90), their openers, shared a 155-run stand that helped Pakistan cruise. They eventually sealed the win with 97 balls to spare.
Pakistans bowlers hunted in packs, but it was Mohammad Asghar, the left-arm spinner, who inflicted the bulk of the damage, taking 4 for 41 in 10 overs.
Asghar, introduced in the 14th over with Sri Lanka A reduced to 94 for 3 after a blazing start, struck in consecutive overs to remove Bhanuka Rajapaksa and Ashan Priyanjan, the captain. Angelo Perera then resisted with 35, but there was little contribution of note otherwise.
Abbas, the right-arm pacer, took three wickets, but was expensive and leaked 50 runs in seven overs. Bhatti took 2 for 40 in eight overs, while left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz took the last wicket to fall - Lakshan Sandakan.
Any hopes Sri Lankas bowlers may have had of picking early wickets and bouncing back were emphatically shattered by Zaman and Sharjeel, who kept them at bay for 23.1 overs, scoring at well over a run-a-ball. Zaman hit seven fours and three sixes in his 77-ball knock, while Sharjeel was equally aggressive by striking at 121.62 courtesy 12 fours and four sixes.
Both batsmen were dismissed in the space of 25 deliveries by Kasun Rajitha, the right-arm medium pacer, but Umar Siddiq and Abdul Rehman Muzammil made sure to avoid further losses.
Sri Lanka A : 199 in 37.5 overs (D de Silva 27, B Rajapaksa 29, A Perera 35, Mohammad Abbas 3/50, Bilawal Bhatti 2/40, Mohammad Asghar 4/41)
Pakistan A : 200-2 in 33.5 overs (Fakhar Zaman 74, Sharjeel Khan 90, Umar Siddiq 20 n.o., K Rajitha 2/42)
