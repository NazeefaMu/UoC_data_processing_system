Teenager takes 5 wickets in 5 balls

Captain of Tissa MMV and right-arm fast bowler Mithira Thenuwara performed the rare feat of taking five wickets in five balls including a hat-trick in an under 13 tournament schools cricket match against Kalutara Vidyalaya at Kalutara on Saturday.
Thenuwara took three wickets off the last three balls of one over and followed it up with two wickets off the first two balls on his next over to finish with figures of 5 for 28 in the Kalutara Vidyalaya first innings of 80.
He followed this fine bowling performance by top scoring with 77 in Tissa Centrals first innings of 162.
When Kalutara Vidyalaya batted a second time Thenuwara was again to the fore capturing a further three wickets. Tissa MMV won the match on first innings.
Scores: Kalutara Vidyalaya 80 (Vishmike Sandeep 33, Dinuka Thisara 31, Mithira Thenuwara 5/28 including hat-trick, Chatura Harshika 2/13) and 68-5 (Mithira Thenuwara 3/28)

No claws out Nine Lives
As far as body swap films go  not that the genre is in itself appealing  Freaky Friday leads by a mile and more. Even the 2003 remake with Lindsay Lohan and Jaime Lee Curtis was as good as the 1976 Jodie Foster film. But given a choice, Id re-watch Rob Schneiders tacky Hot Chick or Zac Efrons sappy 17 Again over the annoying Nine Lives any day.
With a name like Nine Lives, you dont have to be a rocket scientist to figure out theres a feline angle involved.
But to encounter a body swap of such inane proportions, where a human and a cats souls get interchanged, definitely warrants a step back in caution. In fact, when it comes to this film, while youre retreating you might as well go back home.
Casting choice (SUB HEAD)
Heres why: Kevin Spacey plays Tom Brand, a businessman and owner of the company FireBrand, who turns into a cat called Mr. Fuzzypants after a freak accident. This is an actor whos so successful as the formidable Frank Underwood, the Vice President and then President of the USA, in House of Cards.
And now hes playing the role of a cocky man punished for neglecting his family. His retribution is to get stuck in the body of an animal he loathes while trying to get closer to his much-younger wife, Lara (Jennifer Garner), and daughter, Rebecca (Malina Weissman).
Spacey is not the only head-scratching casting choice. An actor of the calibre of Christopher Walken plays the part of a kook called Felix Perkins, who is responsible for the soul switch. Perkins runs a pet store (with only cats) called Purrkins.
Throughout the excruciating duration of the film, the audience is tortured while watching Mr. Fuzzypants first try to prove hes a human stuck in an animals body, then be resigned to his fate and still later strive to be the best pet in the world.
Auxiliary characters
Through this tragedy (somebody play the worlds smallest violin, please), theres an epic power battle mushrooming at FireBrand. A pesky slimeball is trying to get the company sold and theres competition to build the highest building in New York.
Were treated to fleeting glimpses into the lives of the auxiliary characters. Theres nothing tolerable about Nine Lives. Even Mr. Fuzzypants stops being cute (blasphemy for this animal-loving writer) after a point.
This is especially when the CGI effects kick in to make him fly in the air, fall from heights and basically do gymnastics. Theres also the cringe-worthy cat dancing at some point. To top it all, theres a ridiculous sequence where Brand, in all his feline glory, attempts to save a human after a freefall from the top of a building.
The film can also be credited with the irritatingly inaccurate portrayal of a pet owner. Who keeps the litter box right next to a cats food What sort of a cat whisperer has a single conversation with a pet and then proceeds to proclaim the job done
When this eye-roll fest is complete, theres no sigh of relief, just plain astonishment at wilfully putting yourself through this waste of time.

My hands would tremble on touching Aishwarya -Ranbir
Ranbir Kapoor and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have been the talk of the town ever since the trailer of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil came out. Their chemistry is undeniable. After their steamy Filmfare photoshoot, it is impossible for us to wait for them to slay the big screen together!
In a very recent interview, Ranbir spoke about how he was only in class 10 when he first worked as an assistant director with Aishwarya on the sets of the movie Aa Ab Laut Chale. The picture of 16-year-old Ranbir meeting Ash had resurfaced a while ago.
Ranbir said that he was so smitten by Aishwaryas charm, that for him it was love at first sight. He also says that the first time he ever experienced the pain of heartbreak was definitely because of Ash. He had fallen hard for her.
Ranbir, who has romanced with the most beautiful Bollywood stars ever since he started acting in films, says that he was very shy when he had to do intimate scenes with Aishwarya. It was Aishwarya who made him realise that its all the part of an act and as actors it is their responsibility to give it their best shot. That opened up Ranbir, quite a lot. StoryPick

Bangladeshs Mushfiqur hopes to face the big boys more often
DHAKA, Sunday - Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim has pleaded for more test matches against crickets big boys after his side secured their first ever test win over England with an 108-run victory on Sunday. While their limited-overs side had already savoured victories over top teams, Bangladesh had won just seven of 94 tests before Sunday -- five against minnows Zimbabwe and two against second-string West Indies sides.
We are getting there, hopefully if we play more tests there will be more good results coming our way, Mushfiqur said at Sundays presentation. The boys are really eager.
Hopefully the International Cricket Council and the board will give us a couple more series against the big boys. A lack of willing opponents and test playing opportunities against top
nations -- the matches against England were their first in 15 months -- have compounded their problems.
When they are handed the opportunity to play test cricket, they often find it difficult to maintain their intensity over five days, which was the case in their narrow 22-run defeat to England in the series opener in Chittagong.. Over the next few months, Bangladesh will play two tests in New Zealand and one in India.
Mushfiqur said they now needed to adapt to conditions away from home and called Sundays victory a great moment for Bangladesh cricket.
In the last two years weve played really well in our home conditions and its one of our goals to beat every team who come here, the wicketkeeper-batsman said.
The next challenge is our overseas (form). We have to adapt really well because you cant get home conditions everywhere.
Bangladesh beat England en route to reaching the quarter-finals of the 50-over World Cup for the first time last year, and have scored one-day international victories over India, Pakistan and South Africa during a run of six series wins at home.
A cricket-mad nation of 157 million people, Bangladesh will hope that success can now translate into the longer format of the game and England captain Alastair Cook had encouraging words for the South Asian side. You can see their development, specially one-day cricket over the last couple of years, Cook said.
Clearly at home they will be a tough side to beat. They have a got a lot of good spinners.
Its not easy for me to say now, but its a good win for Bangladesh cricket. Some things maybe they are bigger than one game.

Novak Djokovic ready to fight as Andy Murray targets number one spot at Paris Masters
Novak Djokovic is ready to fight for his world number one status as Andy Murray heads into next weeks Paris Masters looking to overtake the Serb.
Murray, 29, won his third title in as many weeks with victory in Vienna on Sunday and could top the rankings with another good run in Paris.
Four-time champion Djokovic says he is rejuvenated after a slump in form.
It makes me want to go on court and fight for every point because there is something to win at the end, he said.
The 12-time Grand Slam champion returns to action after losing in the Shanghai semi-finals two weeks ago.
Djokovic, 29, has finished four of the past five years as the world number one and will hold on to the top ranking if he reaches the final in Paris.
However, failure to do so would allow Murray to overtake him if the Scot can win, or if Murray reaches the final and Djokovic falls before the semis.
Andy Murray
Murray beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to win the title in Vienna
I have been in these particular situations before in terms of ranking, so I know what to do, and I just keep things very simple, said Djokovic.
He returns to Paris for the first time since completing the career Grand Slam with a first French Open title in June, but since then his form has dipped.
Djokovic picked up one more title in Toronto but lost early at Wimbledon and the Olympics, and suffered a bruising defeat by Stan Wawrinka in the US Open final.
Winning the French Open this year has brought a lot of joy to me but on the other hand has taken away a lot from me, as well, said Djokovic.
I felt a little bit exhausted, I must say, and maybe less motivated. So I had to kind of rediscover that feeling of being on the court and keep pushing myself.
I guess it took a little bit of time, more time, and Im in a better state of mind at the moment than I was some months ago.
Murray, in contrast, has won 52 of his past 56 matches, collecting his seventh title of the year in Vienna on Sunday.
Youve got to give him credit for what hes done in the last three or four months - the second part of the year is quite incredible, said Djokovic.
Hes playing maybe the best tennis hes ever played, very consistent, very strong. He definitely deserves to be in the position of being number one at the end of the year.
But that doesnt just depend on him.
Novak Djokovic
Djokovic completed the career Grand Slam on his last visit to Paris in July
Murray has closed the gap dramatically in terms of points over the past four months and now trails by just 415, with 1,000 on offer to the winner in Paris, but Djokovic has won for the past three years on the indoor courts of Bercy.
Obviously he could win the event and, if I lose in the first round, then I am a long way from being number one, said Murray.
Ive never won there before, so to just expect that youre going to win the tournament would be silly.
Top seed Djokovic will open his campaign against Gilles Muller or Nicolas Almagro on Tuesday or Wednesday, while second seed Murray will face Fernando Verdasco or Robin Haase.

Lack of experience cost England against Bangladesh - Cook
DHAKA, Sunday - England captain Alastair Cook said a lack of experience on the subcontinent cost his team dearly as they fell to a first-ever test defeat by Bangladesh in Dhaka on Sunday.
England suffered an astonishing collapse at the Shere Bangla National Stadium, losing 10 wickets in a single session in their second innings, and were all out for 164 while chasing 273 for victory on the third day of the second and final test.
Next up for Cook is a five-match test series in India starting on Nov. 9, on spin-friendly pitches similar to the one England struggled to come to terms with in Dhaka.
Probably, today, we showed our inexperience in these conditions, Cook said. Weve got to learn fast, theres a lot of talent, the experience will help us if we can take things out of it.
We had our chances here. Yesterday evening we didnt bowl great and often lost too many wickets early. The skipper also pointed out how England had contributed to their own downfall with some uncharacteristic generosity in the field, but backed his team to get back on track.
When the ball got rolling we couldnt stop it, he added. If Im honest they shouldnt have been chasing 270, we had four or five chances.
Cook said he had no regrets about the series, which was dogged by security concerns in the leadup, and made a case for England to keep visiting the subcontinent country.
Im really glad Ive been able to lead an England side here, he said. People need to come here and play cricket. You can see their development.
Its not easy for me to say, but its a good win for Bangladesh cricket.
Maybe some things are bigger than one game.

Zimbabwe gives themselves a shot at a draw
HARARE, Monday : Zimbabwe gave themselves a decent shot at salvaging a draw from the first Test against Sri Lanka after a lower order fightback helped them avoid the follow on.
Graeme Cremer crunched a maiden Test ton becoming the first Zimbabwean number 8 since Heath Streak in 2003 to score a hundred in a Test.
Sri Lanka managed to bowl Zimbabwe out with just five overs left on day 3 and the hosts on 373 leaving Rangana Herath's men with a lead of 164 in the first innings.
The day began with Zimbabwe on 88 for 1 well poised to take the fight to Sri Lanka but by lunch they found themselves 174 for 6.
Tino Mawoyo (45) and Hamilton Masakadza (33) could add just four runs to the overnight total before both fell to Suranga Lakmal with the score on 92.
Sean Williams (10), Craig Ervine (12) and Malcolm Waller (22) offered little resistance as spin bamboozled the Zim middle order.
Peter Moor (79) and Captain Cremer put on 132 for Zimbabwe's seventh wicket to frustrate the tourists, batting well into the afternoon session before the wicketkeeper became Lahiru Kumara's first Test victim.
Moor failed to deal with a vicious short ball and Dilruwan Perera took a sharp catch to earn the breakthrough.
Cremer then put on 93 with Donald Tiripano (46) to avoid the follow on but when the latter went it seemed the skipper might be cruelly denied a hundred, as debutant Carl Mumba could make only one before he departed.
With number 11 Christopher Mpofu left to face a solitary Herath delivery the crowd cheered raucously as he kept it out, the skipper high-fived the seamer and would complete his century in the next over.
Mpofu didn't last long though departing after 11 balls for 2 becoming Lakmal's third victim.
Cremer was left not out on 102 a supreme effort from the skipper.
Lakmal's 3 for 69 left him as the pick of the Sri Lanka bowlers with Herath also claiming 3 for the cost of 97. Sri Lanka were left to face a tricky three overs before the close but Kaushal Silva (3 not out) and Dimuth Karunaratne (1 not out) got them safely to the close at 5 for no loss leading by 169 runs.

Resolute Brathwaite foils Pakistan in third Test
SHARJAH: Opener Kraigg Brathwaite needed five runs for a fighting hundred as he foiled Pakistan on the second day of the third and final Test in Sharjah on Monday.
Brathwaite anchored the West Indian innings with a 206-ball 95 not out after they were struggling at 38-3, putting two solid stands of 83 each with Roston Chase (50) for the fifth wicket and with Shane Dowrich (47) for the sixth.
At close skipper Jason Holder was unbeaten on six as West Indies were 244-6, just 37 runs away from Pakistan's first innings total of 281.
This gives West Indies a good position for the first time in the series against Pakistan who are targeting a 3-0 clean sweep after winning the first Test by 56 runs in Dubai and the second by 133 runs in Abu Dhabi.
Brathwaite batted solidly as he negotiated Pakistan's spin-cum-pace attack with full confidence, having so far hit ten boundaries.
West Indies lost Jermaine Blackwood for 23 soon after lunch and it looked like they would once again concede a lead but Brathwaite held the innings well with Chase and Dowrich.
Chase hit leg-spinner Yasir Shah for a straight six to bring up his fifty but was caught in the slip off Mohammad Amir in the next over.
His 89-ball stay was spiced with six fours and a six.
Dowrich then complimented Brathwaite as they took West Indies to 234, with Dowrich benefitting from a catch off Wahab Riaz's no ball on 15 and a let-off by Younis Khan on 21.
Dowrich was finally bowled by Riaz from an inside edge.
West Indies were struggling when they lost the key wicket of Darren Bravo for 11 before lunch.
Bravo miscued a drive off a flighted ball from spinner Zulfiqar Babar and was smartly snapped up by a diving Amir at extra cover, his first catch in 20 Tests.
Amir had no catch in his first 19 Tests -- most matches without a catch for a player from the start of his career.
West Indies got off to a disastrous start, with opener Leon Johnson trapped leg-before by Riaz in the fourth over for just one.
Bravo, who made a fighting hundred in the first Test, was left frustrated by short-pitched deliveries from Riaz and Amir before getting out.
Marlon Samuels also did not last long, trapped leg-before by leg-spinner Yasir Shah without scoring to leave West Indies struggling on 38-3.
Earlier, leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo finished with figures of 4-77 while fast bowlers Shannon Gabriel took 3-67 and Alzarri Joseph 2-57 to dismiss Pakistan for 281.
Pakistan added 26 to their overnight score before losing Amir for 20 and Shah for 12, both to Joseph. The pair added 32 for the ninth wicket. AFP
