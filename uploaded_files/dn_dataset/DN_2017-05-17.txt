MRs double standard revealed: Warnasinghe
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksas double standard is visible by meeting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Indian House in Colombo, Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) National Organiser and Western Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said.
He said former President Rajapaksa who made Wimal Weerawansa urge the people at the May Day Rally at Gall Face to hoist black flags on the arrival of the Indian Prime Minister, went to meet him with former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.He made these observations at a press conference at the JHU head office in Battaramulla yesterday.
This is the double standard of Mahinda Rajapaksa, Warnasinghe said.
Weerawansa said they would hoist black flags when the Indian Prime Minister comes to Sri Lanka to take part in the United Nations International Vesak Day Celebrations in Colombo. Weerawansa said the Indian Prime Minister would come to sign the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement and to take over the Trincomalee Oil Tanks, he said.
Warnasinghe said Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa went to meet the Indian Prime Minister. He said no details of the discussion has been revealed to the media.
They have not revealed that they objected ETCA or taking over of Trincomalee oil tanks, Warnasinghe said. But Mahinda Rajapaksa government did not cancel the IOC agreement during his tenure. His government gave a slot of the Mannar Basin to India free, he said. JHU Co-chairman Ven. Handigalle Vimalasara Thera and JHU Western Provincial Councillor Nirosha Athukorala also spoke.

On naming love
The term reading, I feel, has much more to it than it really implies when one says that he or she had read a book. Visuals such as films could also be read if the mere superficial meaning is altered or shifted. When I watched the Sinhala film Premaya Nam (Naming Love), I felt as if I am reading a page-moving psychological narrative with quite a lot of meaningful layers.
On surface level, it is a film of suspense mood. The narrative is woven about Vishva (Shyam Fernando) a married man who suffers from a mental disorder. It is something the common spectator is not aware about.
Vishvas doctor familiarises the spectator with the sickness as OCD or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. It may not sound as a serious sickness. But in the light of the happenings, frame by frame, the spectator gets the feeling that it brings in painful and embarrassing moments in day to day activities.
Chaotic disorder
The person who suffers most in the narrative is shown as Samadhi, wife of Vishva. She looks desperate as a marital partner. The spectator, or the reader of the visual narrative, gets to witness how everything goes well on surface layer. There are, however, occasional moments of disarray leading to a complex chaotic disorder in the relationship between the young couple.
Their problem comes to be discussed at a very serious level by parents of both parties. They too look desperate and agonised. The medical treatment continues to the point that there is not a single moment of dullness in any visual frame. Serious psychological matters are intimately discussed. They are presented sensitively and quite touchingly. No unwanted scene is inserted to make the spectator to feel the pulse of the pseudo pop cultural traits. Instead, the characters become mentors who matter in their lives, paving the way to ones own classical examination of behaviour pattern.
The spectator does not get the feeling that he is being advocated on medical science. On seeing the series of visuals shot in the mental hospital with a group of other patients, I went down my memory lane reminiscent of films such as Viridiana and One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. But I am pretty certain that not an iota of a scene is cribbed by way of piracy. Kalpana and Vindana ought to be commended on their elevated level of creative imagination that surpasses the mere barriers of persuasive vulgarity. The hallmark of the film from a synoptic view is the sense of hum, a sympathy at the introspection that embraces.
The moments of bliss suddenly fade into moments of pain and pity, creating an inner layer of silence within the mind of the spectator. This too is blended in a tinge of religiosity that needs to be perceived in silence. Music has been used to enhance this feeling.
Private experience
The mental disorder of the protagonist of the narrative, Vishwa, drives himself and his fellow mates into a sense of strange unhappiness. This is depicted in a series of visuals: the inner agony not only of an individual, but a whole group of human beings. The vision that emanates is of human interest, and transcends a mere private experience.
The lack of human understanding could drive humans themselves into a so called crazy world where an imbalance could bring about the creation of an outsider.
This was actually the central theme of Albert Camus novel Outsider. The English writer Colin Wilson too tried to interpret who an outsider is in his popular research in the early sixties. All in all, the Sinhala film Premaya Nam could be assigned as one of the trendsetting imaginative visual creations to emerge.
The narrative rises to a recovery of the imbalance. It was flashed that the story was based on a true story. True enough, truth is stranger than fiction and the truth is blissful. May it be stated with honesty that this is the type of screenplay that should be available in the printed form, enabling the young cinematographers to graph the essence of creativity and social conscience.

National Poson festival to be celebrated on grand scale
The National Poson Festival will be celebrated on a grand scale in Anuradhapura, Mihintale, Awkana and Thantirimale.
Anuradhapura government agent and the head of the National Poson Celebrations Steering Committee told the Daily News that around 800,000 to 1 million devotees are expected during the Poson season in Anuradhapura.
The Poson Full Moon Poya Day falls on June 8. The period between June 5 to 11 has been declared the National Poson Celebrations Week.
The government agent said in view of Poson, all liquor shops and meat stalls in the Anuradhapura district will be closed between June 4 to 12. Also, the sale and use of cigarettes will also be discouraged.
The traditional Poson week-long pirith chanting will commence when the water from Tisa Wewa tank is taken to the special pirith mandapaya in Mahamewnawa in a procession starting from Isurumuniya Raja Maha Vihara on June 6. The Mihintala Lakehouse Aloka Pooja will be held on five days starting from June 7 and ending on June 11. The President and Prime Minister are expected to participate in the illumination programme on Poson Full Moon Poya Day.
Government officials said the prevailing drought conditions in the Anuradhapura district would affect Poson arrangements since the water level of tanks is decreasing. Officials said all arrangements are being made to provide sufficient drinking water to the devotees although there could be a problem of bathing and washing. Bathing at Tisa Wewa has been discouraged while water levels at Nuwara Wewa and Basawakkulama tanks are low.
Meanwhile, Ruwanweli Chetiyaramadhipathi Ven. Pallegama Hemarathana Nayaka Thera told the Daily News that the forthcoming Anuradhapura National Poson Festival will not be a carnival, entertainment event or commercialized festival. Authorities will take action to maintain the spiritual values and interests of devotees during Poson, the thera said.
The prelate requested devotees visiting Anuradhapura and other sacred shrines to be dressed in white. He also requested devotees not to bring, use or distribute alcohol.

Nature to rescue
John Keats is one of the supreme poets of all time in the tapestry of English literature. In other words, he is a poet genius who made an everlasting influence on poetry. His father was an ostler. He was born at Moorfield in Lodon and schooled at Entfield. John Keats became a surgeon but threw down his scalpels to take to full time poetry. It is said that he had hated the scalpels, the reason is not known. The literati owe a great debt to him for that and endowing us a vast literature in the genre of poetry.
His sonnet written in 1817 On My First Looking Into Capmans Hormer is regarded as a gem of inspiration to his followers. A thing of beauty is a joy forever is another line from his quill that has passed into language which is in evergreen memory of literary lovers. By the time he was able to appear on the literary landscape of the period as a budding poetic icon, he was a mere boy.
Bursting energy
His unhappy married life to Fanny Browne put him on the rack. The pain changed into bursting energy and the literary world was benefited greatly. Feather headed Fanny was hated by many. The five odes to his credit are still admired by literary enthusiasts as the finest poems ever given to the world by a single poet.
How humble and creative these poets are! Once John Keats, Ley Hunt and another literary figure of the same calibre had had a friendly sonnets writing competition and he had written the best impromptu sonnet. We read and enjoy the real value of the Nile in To the Nile because of this little competition. The spirit of Greek mythology is often reflected in his oeuvre. Greek stories gave much colour to his poetry. All in all, John Keats was above all things the poet of romance. If William Wordsworth is considered the high priest of the romantic school of poetry, Keats plays the second fiddle only to him.
If a poet-painters list is arrayed, is there any objection to place Keats at the head of the list In this seasonable month of May of fruits and flowers, a profound discussion on Keats contribution to poetry seems justifiable.
The sense of beauty and the sense of colour are two remarkable gifts of a great artiste. Keats had it to the brimful. In a nutshell, Keats was the greatest colourist in English poetry. His glut of passion on beauty of nature put him on a good stead in nature poetry. His love for lustrous bubbling of red-wine made Ode to a Nightingale rich in value. Imagination is the wellspring of genuine creativity. Keats never lacked this poetic element.
Thinking in imageries was child play for him. It seems a bounden duty of the genuine Keats followers to empower the prodigy with his ultra-active poetic imagination for the progress of a literary Sri Lanka.
The owl, for all his feathers, was a cold;
The hare limped trembling through the frozen grass;
And silence was the flock in wooly fold
Environmental tranquility
His graphic power was also significant as imagination. The miscellany of poetic capabilities made him a true poetic icon for us to enjoy life in tranquility. My authentic experience in enjoying his poetry, especially his odes, lies in the fact that it should essentially be in mental, physical and environmental tranquility. Its a recommendable meditation to the weary mind of the city dwellers, a soothing balm to his tired mind. Thus, the trudge of life could be made a pleasurable journey through poetry. Lets give a try. My concern here is to drive home the concept,
Contemplation of the timeless beauty of nature can inspire a dreamlike enchantment that temporarily transcends mortal cares or pain
Keats sets images before us to ponder on, gives food for thoughts. His lines are full of glamour and poetic charm. They intoxicate us beyond our control. The ode chosen by the writer for this literary discussion is Ode to a Nightingale. This piece of poetry is regarded as one of the supreme wonders of the poetic art in the world, so far. The perfume of poetry is conveyed to the reader by embalming him in the intoxicating fragrance of the wild flowers. Keats emerges as the colossus of the blend of poetry and music.
Lo and behold, he died at the age of twenty five in Rome. He rests in peace beneath the pyramid of Caius Cestius. It is said to be a serene spot going with the spirit of Keats and Shelly wrote that his wish was to sleep beside him.
It makes one in love with death to think that one should be buried in so sweet a place.;
Literary colleagues
Before his death Keats had earnestly requested his literary friends to write on his epitaph,
Here Lies One Whose Name Is Writ In Water but the lovely words were made idle by the ever grateful literary colleagues by writing his epitaph, Here Lies One Whose Name Is Writ On The Rockface Of Time.
Visiting such a place is bliss to a literary lover. It is a sweet pilgrimage. Financial restrictions annul my desire, yet if a generous sponsor or any charitable organization would come forward to lend me a helping hand I would bring greater wealth to commensurate with the undertaking.
Keats poetry became more popular posthumously. It is the nature in the human world.

Nawinne calls for report on dual citizen MPs
Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S.B.Nawinne has instructed Immigration and Emigration Controller General to submit a report furnishing details of the Parliamentarians holding dual citizenship.
Nawinne told the Daily News that he requested the report in his capacity as the subject minister. He also said he asked the Department to peruse the records of 20 to 25 years to find out the details of MPs who are dual citizens.
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila last week placed an RTI request with the Immigration and Emigration Department requesting details of MPs with dual citizenship. He expressed his intention to take legal action against MPs with dual citizenship for the offence of providing wrong information to the Elections Commission.
The move comes in the wake of Appeal Court decision on May 3 disqualifying Galle District MP Geetha Kumarasinghe from holding the Parliamentary Seat on the grounds that she holds dual citizenship- in Sri Lanka and Switzerland. However, the Elections Commission decided to wait until the Supreme Court announces its ruling on the appeal filed by Kumarasinghe against the Appeal Court decision.
Consequent to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, dual citizens are barred from contesting the national elections and they cannot represent Parliament.

Plague of modern man
Today, man is living in the twenty first century and this human society is entirely different from the ancient world. Modern man is rapidly accomplishing the results of his scientific and technological progress. Although we are not entitled to say that archaic man is better than modern man, it is explicitly clear that modern man is facing a lot of socio-economic, political and environmental problems. Needless to say that the society in which we live today is highly complicated and bewildered with many tangles (jatas). The major differentiation from the ancient era is that modern man is facing the danger of extinction. Some scientists and certain political soothsayers are of the opinion that the whole world could be affected by a nuclear war. Some erudite Tibetan monks enlighten others that there would be a kind of war for major destruction.
Bahijata or man-made problems
Day by day, hundreds and hundreds of new troubles and social problems arise in our society. Poverty, malnutrition, population problem, environmental pollution, unemployment, drug-related crimes, shocking crimes that related to religious fanaticism, poverty-related crimes, terrorism, global warming, world-shattering nature of man are to name but a few. In short, the whole human society is in a state of confusion or bewilderment. This current socio-economic situation is clearly suggested by the Pali term bahijata or outer tangle.
All are running after pleasures, money and corporeal happiness without understanding what they really are doing. Can this chaotic situation be impeded in a certain way Who is there in the world, heavenly deity or someone else to give proper medication for these man-made problems Specially, our young generation is running after mental pleasures by over-using of computers and cellular phones. What would be the results of this misuse of technological appliances for them With this infatuated addiction, it seems that there is a considerable change of traditional values and collapse of accepted morality and moral duties.
When social morality collapses, everything would go to ruination. All the members of any given society would be seriously worried by such type of unethical behaviorism. Therefore, it is not incorrect to say, as opined by Prof. Gunapala Dharmasiri, that modern man is digging his own grave at a frantic rate.
Kamagavesi Society
According to Buddhism that modern society can be named as pleasure-seeking social order (Kamagavesi Samaja), and it is really money-centred and extremely competitive. As a result, there is no collaboration and cooperation among human beings at all. It seems that man tries to seek his own happiness through competition, but he never finds it in the circle of competition. Competition gives birth to despondency, misery, unhappiness, mental suffering and unsatisfactory results.
Negative phenomena and negative energies are the very foundation of competition. We need to understand properly the big difference of competition and co-operation. Therefore, we all are in urgent need of a considerable transformation of human attitudes. Human attitudes and thoughts play major role in our progress or disaster. So, pleasure-seeking attitudes (Kamagavesi sankappas) of this pleasure-seeking society (Kamagavesi Samaja) should be understood very carefully.
Albert Einstein
What is the respond for this pointless competition and growing discontent of mankind Is there any socio-religious thought or scientific thinking which is capable of bringing peace and cooperation to this confused world Albert Einstein, the greatest scientist (Physicist) of the twentieth century articulates thus:
If there is any religion which is acceptable to modern scientific mind, it is Buddhism. It is capable of bringing peace, prosperity and happiness into profoundly disturbed world.
The greatest scientist of the twentieth century appropriately shows us the proper way to happiness and prosperity, and also to world peace. He unquestionably points out that Buddhism has the scientific foundation to solve the unethical problems and dishonourable behaviour of mankind. Therefore, it is the utmost duty of man today to focus the maximum attention to the categorical word of Albert Einstein. If not, we all will have to unexpectedly face with thousands of new forms of mental and physical sufferings.
Mythical views (Ditthis)
Dogmatic mythical views (Ditthis) play a major role in many conflicts of the world today. Rigid views close open-mindedness and they show aggression to genuine ethical ideas of human beings. Some people those who are bounded by certain religious mythical views (Ditthis) are not ready to read or consider the religious and ethical texts belong to others. They never even give permission to their followers of thinking or hearing of such things which belong to other faiths. They consider that all other faiths are enemies to their religion and culture. This is, in a way to forget the mans brotherhood and common feelings. Buddhism discards all these mythical views. The teachings of the Buddha paved the way for tearing the mythical curtain of dogmatic views of the 6th century B.C. in India.
Blind faith
Blind faith certainly conduces to seize wrong views and then the person would do whatever the terrible thing to satisfy his idea in the name of his grasped view. Mistaken wrong views are so dangerous for the person himself or herself and for others. Buddhism teaches us to be open-minded and to give up all pre-conceived ideas and prejudices in order to understand truth and reality. Buddhism is not a secret doctrine and it is open to all human beings alike. Buddhism does not demand blind faith (amulika saddha) from its followers and it instructs us to cultivate saddha (confidence) but not bhakti or mere faith.
According to Buddhist teachings, mere faith may lead us to partial blindness of knowledge. According to one classification, Saddha is explained in Buddhism as twofold: amulika saddha- (blind faith) and akaravati saddha - (confidence grounded on knowledge and inquiry). We are advised to cultivate akaravati saddha and whereas amulika saddha is to be abandoned. Those who keep hold of blind faith are like unsighted people and they never see the truth or reality of man and universe.
Kamagavesi problems
What is the Buddhist attitude to the problems of modern Kamagavesi Society Does it recommend any appropriate process of finding an answer to these continual hardships Before going to give solutions to various problems of this modern industrial man, or better say, computer-encircled man, Buddhism advices us to scrutinize the real cause of all problems. It explicitly explains that all the family problems, socio-economic and political troubles arise as a consequence of mans desire (lobha), hatred (dosa), and delusion (moha).
It is true that man abuses environmental resources and produces pernicious nuclear weapons. Why does he produce atomic bombs, laser bombs, and inter-continental missiles What is the use of supersonic fighters How many billions of money that they burn up for inventing such lethal weapons What are they going to satisfy by producing such heinous weapons These are really the results of mans desire (lobha) and hatred (dosa). Therefore, it is correct to say that over the entire world, today spreads an invisible umbrella of computerized nuclear terror. This proves that mans desires can never be satisfied with whatever he owns.
Snare of desire (Tanhajala)
Desire or tanha (or lobha) or the fever of unsatisfied longing is to be understood with awareness. We all are in the ocean of desire (Tanha-samudda). Really, it is a poisoned arrow (Tanha-salla). People are dancing according to the feelings of the strike of that poisoned arrow of desire (Tanha-salla). At that moment, they behave as devils who do not like ethical actions and nor they see the real nature of humanity since they are encircled by the snare of desire (tanha-jala). The extreme desires conduce to so many ills and, then corruptions overpower in our society. Tanha can kill the peaceful serenity and softness of mans mind. We are asked to uproot desire, if we need to lead a happy life. From birth to death, we are running after sensual pleasures, wealth and so on. Finally we get exhausted and frustrated and, when we perceive our past running, then only we understand that we have run after our own desired-mind.
Political leaders chase political motivations and they are driven by their isms or ideologies. They always think that, this system only is the real politics; every other movement is in the wrong path. Some religious leaders are of the opinion, This only is the precise truth, everything else is false (idhameva saccam moghamaam) and engage in killing people belong to other faiths and destroy the religious monuments of other religions. Because of these perverted mental notions they are chasing after their own ideas like blind people. Finally they get nothing but mental and physical repercussions.
Oneness of mankind
Today, many are not intelligent enough to recognize the sacredness of humanity, and top priority is given to commercial motivations. Many are not capable of understanding the fact that why they hate their own species. This is because of blindness to reality and human ethics. In accordance with the summary of the Vasettha sutta and the Assalayana sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya, we may come to the following conclusion:
There is one nation in the world, that is, human nation;
There is one caste in the world, that is, human caste.
Although humans have certain wrong views and assumptions regarding race and caste distinctions, they have to accept the fact that, All are equal before the moral law (Dhamma). Wrong actions guided by wrong views never pacify our hearts, and the day would come to give us repercussions for our wrong actions. Wrong-doers can escape from the country-law but not from the chain of moral law. Carelessness of moral law means the deterioration and destruction of everything. It is obvious that crimes, social ills, and war-games are the effects of negligence of the principles of moral law, and again it is targeted at the destruction of mans own species. It comes from unreality or without proper understanding of the Dhamma.
Mind culture
Mind is the fore-runner of our actions and thoughts. It can be tested by anybody in the world if they are commonsensical people. Our positive mental behavior or wholesome mental operation is the very foundation of our future happiness. Long-lasting happiness never comes only from our money or wealth. Today, there is a growing tendency towards to understand that money plays a secondary role in experiencing real happiness. Real happiness always comes from the positive mental energies. Positive mental energies are spontaneously generated by loving-kindness (metta), kindness (karuna), empathetic joy (mudita), equanimity (upekkha), gentleness (mudu), giving (dana), observing precepts (sila), meditation (bhavana), and such type of mental and physical proceedings.
To change this confused human society, cultivation of compassion (karuna) and loving-kindness (metta) are essentially needed today. Without the cultivation of compassion, the nature and sacredness of humanity can never be understood.
Supersonic fighters, fighter-bombers or inter-continental atomic missiles, nuclear weapons are not automatically functioned, and it is the man who operates them to destruct others. World political leaders play a major role in organising symposiums and pass orders for creating new battlefields. The major problem is that our socio-political leaders never see and never think of the fact that our own fellow brothers and sisters are suffering in the battlefields. They just see the statistics of the war, and statistics never lament, never bleed. In the name of propagation of certain religious sects, some behead the thousands of innocent ones and wish for a comfortable seat in a heaven. How blind are they
Emperor Ashoka
Emperor Dharmashoka of ancient India saw the Kalinga battlefield and has drastically changed his mind. He gave up winning the territories by war and embraced Buddhism. After that transformation, his ideological slogan was the Dhamma or righteousness. He ruled the whole Indian sub-continent not by force but by righteousness. He has obviously proven that one serene word is more powerful than hundreds of brave slogans. Even today we speak of his unparalleled greatness, and supreme qualities of his life as an righteous Emperor.
Ashoka inscriptions and Ashoka pillars speak volumes of his righteous actions and kind-hearted thoughts which are full of serenity. So, peace is not merely a word or a theory, and it can be practiced. But it needs loving-kindness, honesty, and proper understanding of man and universe (or samma-ditthi).
Law of nature
Man is not capable of having a complete understanding of the law of nature. The law of nature of the earth is linked with universe and universal energies. So, first we have to understand the law of universe. If we can have a good knowledge of universal energies, then we are in the position of having a sort of knowledge of universe.
Now there are many man-made problems in this computerized age. Many of them are related to our mother earth, our one and only home. The tragedy is today our mother-earths resources are in the danger of rapid deterioration. We, all human beings and other species are well nourished by mother earth by giving pathavi-oja (sap or essence of the earth) and pathavi-rasa (taste of earth). Therefore, it is our utmost duty to pay gratitude and respect to our mother earth.
Ethical understanding
Today, we are facing much catastrophic problems like air pollution, water pollution, land pollution, Radiation problems, deforestation, desertification, over-grazing, over-fishing, over-urbanization, and over-industrialization and so on. Man violates his own environment, really his own home, irrespective of the law of nature (or Dhamma). This is a result of the gap between scientific knowledge and ethical understanding. Knowledge without moral foundation is entirely blind. It produces detrimental consequences to whole world. Therefore, the vital base of peaceful society is ethical consideration. Buddhism would say that we should cultivate a sacred and friendly attitude and motherly-affection (matu-sineha) towards our environment.
Animisalochana puja
The Buddha after attaining the Fully-Enlightenment (samma-sambuddhatva) explained us how to have a Great concern and great respect on nature and natural phenomena. The Fully-Enlightened One (samma-sambuddha), during his second week after the Enlightenment, silently taught a great moral lesson to all human beings. As a mark of profound gratitude to the Bo-tree (assattha- in Pali, esatu- in Sinhala, or pippal or pipphali in Newari and Nepali languages) that sheltered Him during His endeavour for Enlightenment, the Buddha sat down at a certain distance, gazing at the sacred assattha tree with motionless eyes for one whole week. This is called animisalocana puja. This first lesson of the Buddha teaches us that our nature should be respected well, and that it further emphasizes that nature requires a very friendly attitude and motherly-affection from human beings.
Socio-economic problems
All the socio-economic and political problems are the results of misguided knowledge and desire (tanha). Mans extreme tanha or selfishness is responsible for these problems. It appears that solutions rest with changing the hearts of humans and there would be no any other way. Imposing law and legal actions do not entirely support for minimizing these crises. Attitudinal transformation plays the most important role here. So, we need to implement heartfelt ventures. Heart is the seat of feelings and strong emotions. Anger and ill-will can be cooled down by calmness of our heart or practicing meditation. Buddhism, as an ethical teaching, advocates the practice of meditation to eradicate so many ills and evils. It is the greatest medication for so many mental disorders and physical predicaments of modern society. Proper practicing of Buddhist meditation is strong enough to change the heart of man and bringing the solutions to all the problems of modern man.

PM appreciates measures taken to strengthen SL-China cultural programmes
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday, appreciated the measures jointly taken by the Book Publishers Associations of Sri Lanka and China to strengthen the cultural exchange programmes of the two countries.
He was addressing a special meeting held with members of the Book Publishers Association in Beijing, China. Under the exchange programmes, several Chinese books have been translated in to Sinhalese and several Sinhala books have been translated in to Chinese.
Chinese Book Publishers Association Chairman Su Sha Xu said that they had already taken measures to translate the political biography of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe written by Sampath Bandara in to the Chinese language.
Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Yi Xianliang said that the political biography of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesigne would be very important for Chinese readers, since it was about the recent history of Sri Lanka and a biography of an experienced politician in Asia.
Addressing the Meeting, Sri Lankan Ambassador in China Karunasena Kodituwakku said that apart from publishing books, various training programmes have also been conducted by the Book Publishers Association of the two countries.
Chinese Book Publishers Association handed over some souvenirs to the Prime Minister.
A copy of the book "Makara Purawatha" written by the head of the Sinhala Department of Beijing Foreign Language University Prof. Shong Wo, was also handed over to the Prime Minster.

PMI decreases 24.7 index points in April
The Manufacturing Sector Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) , following the seasonal pattern, recorded 41.8 in April which is a decrease of 24.7 index points compared to March 2017.
This indicates that the manufacturing activities contracted in April 2017, which is largely attributable to the decrease in the Production and New Orders sub-indices, following the significant increases observed in PMI for the month of March 2017. As highlighted by the survey respondents the new year holidays in April have also contributed to this seasonal decline in
manufacturing activities.
Further, all the sub-indices of PMI declined compared to the previous month.
Moreover, all the sub-indices of PMI apart from Suppliers Delivery Time sub-index dropped below the neutral 50 threshold in April 2017.
However, the expectation for activities indicates an improvement for the next three months.
The Services Sector PMI recorded 54.2 index points in April from 60.8 index points in March 2017.
The decline in PMI over the last months value indicates that economic activities in the Services sector decelerated noticeably in April 2017 compared to March 2017.
The deceleration (slower expansion) in Services sector was supported by New Businesses, Business Activity and Expectations for Activity. Backlogs of Work and Employment declined in April compared to March 2017.
The Employment sub-index recorded a value below 50 threshold for the first time since survey began in May 2015, mainly due to delay in new recruitment.

## Title: Presidents take on Galle Face crowd

Presidents take on Galle Face crowd
A full two weeks after the Galle Face May Day rally of the Joint Opposition President Maithripala Sirisena has come out with his own take on what was billed as the largest crowd ever at a May Day rally in this country, of course from the point of view of JO stalwarts. The crowd phenomenon had so emboldened the JO that it has gone gung-ho and strutting about predicting the imminent fall of the Yahapalanaya government, even before the target dates set by Mahinda Rajapaksa. Not only that, attempts are also being made to topple the North Central and Central Provincial Councils in the first flush of post Galle Face and a change in the equation in parliament too is being contemplated, with JO members predicting that their May Day tide will make the SLFP MPs in the government have a rethink.
Even the temporary reprieve received by MP Geetha Kumarasinghe has been attributed to the fallout of the Galle Face rally and so carried away are some JO MPs by their May Day frolics that Vasudeva Nanayakkara has once again reiterated his groups pledge to join a SLFP led government after ousting Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. In addition, certain JO stalwarts have also gone to the extent of interpreting the disillusionment among certain SLFP Ministers in the Unity Government to their highly successfully Galle Face May Day rally. Even the proposed Cabinet reshuffle is seen as the pressing of panic buttons.
However, the sober reality must have dawned on most who consider May Day crowds as the barometer to gauge the popularity or otherwise of a political party or a grouping, following the down to earth views expressed by President Sirisena. Speaking at a function at Aralagangwila to distribute land deeds among the needy President Sirisena went onto stress that crowds at May Day rallies were not the be all and end all. He said the public were well aware as to who drew the largest crowds at the last Presidential Election. But for all that, he, as the Common Candidate, emerged the victor. He warned those who are overwhelmed by the Galle Face crowds not to harbour any thoughts that the government is going to collapse under the sheer weight of the May Day crowds.
Like the President said, there are many dynamics at play at an election that are not reflected in May Day crowds. The President of course is dead right. To begin with, there is the overwhelming numbers that constitute the middle class in this country who dont bother with May Days. Voters also include segments that belong to different religions, castes, classes and other demographies. There is also the aged the youth, and most importantly the floating vote that are not factored in May Day crowds. There are other dynamics in electoral politics that May Day crowds dont reflect. For example, the vast percentage of those who traditionally vote for the UNP are those who dont care for political rallies or May Day parades which are mostly attended by the hoi polloi who are provided with buth packets and fortified with hooch. A good many of these folk are even unaware where they are taken or for what purpose. To most village folk, a trip to Galle Face is a rarity, nay, a novelty, and for others, a venue for entertainment and a golden opportunity to take in the capital city, similar to villagers descending on the city to view Vesak in their thousands.
Election predictions based on crowds at political and May Day rallies have come a cropper even in the past. There were unbelievable crowds at the final political rally of Vijaya Kumaranatunga, in Katana, presided over by Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike, in 1977, at a time when the actor turned politician was at the zenith of his popularity. For all that, the rather drab and unimpressive Wijayapala Mendis won the poll by a majority of over 4,000 votes. It was the same at the 1982 Presidential Election where Hector Kobbekaduwa drew massive crowds compared to JRJ who eventually polled 53% of the vote.
President Sirisena also made the pertinent observation that there were crowds numbering well over one hundred thousand (laksha ganan) who came to greet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Dickoya and that, had all these crowds being included in their May Day rallies they could have filled the Galle Face esplanade several fold. In fact these crowds represented the solid UNP vote, with the plantation community well known for their allegiance to the UNP, though, they prefer to have their own May Day celebrations in their own backyard, thereby denying their vast presence at the UNP May Day rallies.
Hence, crowds dont tell a tale in electoral politics and the sooner this fact sinks into heads of the JO membership, now on cloud nine, the sooner they would come to terms with reality. Mahinda Rajapaksa of course has always been enamoured by crowds and this time too has based his political fortunes on the JO Galle Face May Day rally.

Pucsl calls for public views
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the electricity sector regulator, recently opened the path for public to comment on the Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) 2018-2037, prepared by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).
The LCLTGEP was compiled based on the results of the latest electricity expansion planning studies conducted by the CEB for the planning period of 2018-2037 and it aims to cater the forecasted demand growth by identifying the least cost plant addition sequence based on the most sustainable technology to avoid electricity shortfalls in the country.
The plan has been submitted to the PUCSL for the approval.
The Plan is one of the most important as it plans the electricity generation for the country for the next 20 years to ensure energy security as the least cost plant mix for each year is identified by analysing and evaluating various technology options. It serves as a guideline to facilitate the decision-makers in making decisions in line with national policy objectives, by exploring and evaluating various generation technology options in different situations, Public Utilities Commission Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe said.
By opening the path to the public, we hope to involve all the related and interested parties in the decision-making process through opinions, views, alternative proposals and suggestions on the LCLTGEP 2018-2037, and we hope to increase the transparency of the approval process and increase public participation in the decision-making process of Sri Lankas most important energy generation plan.
The Sri Lankan power system had a total installed capacity of approximately 4018 MW by the end of the year 2016 with a total dispatchable capacity of 3538 MW, including non-dispatchable plants of capacity 516 MW owned by private sector developers.
The majority of dispatchable capacity is owned by CEB (about 82 percnt of the total dispatchable capacity), which includes 1379.25MW of hydro and 1510.7 MW of thermal generation capacity.
Balance dispatchable capacity, which is totally thermal plants, is owned by Independent Power Producers (IPPs). Sri Lanka recorded 2453MW of maximum demand in 2016 and generated a total of 14250GWh of electricity in the same year. The generation demand is expected to grow 5.9 percent per annum from 2018 -2022 while in addition the peak demand is expected to grow at 5.1 percent per annum, the data shows.
The same expected to grow 4.9 percent per annum from 2018-2037 which the peak demand is expected cross at 4.5 percent. The total investment required for implementing the 2018-2037 plan in the next 20 years is approximately USD 14.568 Billion (LKR 2,168.93 billion) without considering the projects for which funds have already been committed.

Auckland Writers' Festival:
"I am firm believer in the power of books. Whether through the sharing of knowledge , new ideas or inspiration, books play an important role in our lives and I am delighted to see the ongoing development of the schools programme, particularly the assistance given to six South Auckland schools to travel and attend the festival." - Mayor of Auckland.
The Auckland Writers Festival will be held from May 16 to 21 at the aotea centre NZ. They call their Festival as Love Story. As a Sri Lankan writer and publisher who pioneered the first book launch in Sri Lanka, and a pioneer member of the Sri Lanka Book Publishers' Association I came to know about the AWF17 through the media of NZ.
In fact I got the souvenir Love Story from the Onehunga Public Library. I was delighted to know that the festival organizers are very keen about the student population who will one day take over the baton in the future from the pioneers of present predecessors!
In Sri Lanka too, all the educational and cultural authorities including the government and private sector are faced with many challenges. The book publishers are no exception. The problem is on how to develop the reading habit and make use of books and other reading materials, using books and libraries. Even at a Literacy rate high as 90 percent Sri Lankan reading population is not efficient enough when it comes to the reading habit.
The Sri Lanka Book Publishers' Association, the national organization of Sri Lankan Book Publishers, has pioneered in populariing book culture in Sri Lanka through its annual event, the Colombo International Book Exhibition. The exhibition has become a showcase of the growth of Sri Lankan Book Publishing Industry. Besides, they have taken another step forward by creating the Golden Book Award for the Best Novel of the year (the first print published by any organized publishing house). There is a cash award of Rs 500,000 for the finalist and Rs 50,000 to the shortlisted entries. The Golden Book Award is selected from the shortlisted novels, five in number.
Auckland Writers' Festival is a varied programme. The NZ Book Awards handpicks 16 finalists. The complete collection will be 150 books, and a long list of 40 titles across the four categories. These books demonstrate the vigour, courage, determination, skill and cultural significance of NZ Literature.
The Awards event is showcasing as the first public event of the NZWF. It will be held at the ASB Theatre in Auckland.
Every year NZWF stages over 180 public events with 170 best writers and thinkers with over 24,000 festival-goers. There will be 7000 young people to celebrate the world books and thinkers.
Four of the country's most respected novelists will be announced. The winning novelist is awarded with $50,000 by the Acorn Foundation. The prize is now is in its second year. Because of difference in opinion for the first time an international judge is also included as a member of the selectors.
Apart from the main award, there are categories of poetry, illustrated and non fiction. The Ockham NZ Book Awards are supported by (apart from Acorn Foundation) Ockham Residential Creative NZ, The Acorn Foundation, Book Tokens NZ Ltd, and Royal Society of NZ Te Aparangi.
NZ publishes over 2000 NZ titles each year and turns over an estimated $3330 million a year. The Publishers' Association (PANZ) members include both largest international publishers and vibrant independent publishing community. The PANZs role is to represent publishers interests to industry and government.

Showcasing directorial prowess
Sithaththee a teledrama directed by seasoned tele-drama director Ranjan Prasanna is ready for release. The tele-dramais produced by internationally acclaimed Sri Lankan film director Chandran Rutnam.
Sithaththee is woven around a newly married young couple, Arunalee and Thejan. The tele-drama made with newest technology using special effects is poised to take viewers to a new dimension and offer them with a novel experience.
Talking to Daily News T&C Ranjan Prasanna said his ambition is to make tele-dramas with a difference to attract masses.
People always yearn for new experiences. We as tele-drama directors who bring our products to their doorsteps should understand their pulse and offer them with valued products, says Ranjan Prasanna.
Hailing from Piliyandala this ambitious artiste has learnt finer-points in acting and stage drama direction by veteran actor Jayalal Rohana.
Jayalal Rohana who has a wealth of knowledge in acting shared his experiences and abilities with me. When I stepped into the cinema sphere I met Shelton Payagala of Malata Noena Bamaru fame who offered me to have hands-on experience in filmmaking, says Ranjan Prasanna.
He adds, When Benette Ratnayake did the film Aswesuma I joined him as a second assistant director and got the opportunity to associate with veteran actor Joe Abeywickrama who played a leading role in the film. Abeywickrama gave me a golden advice. He told me to always do things right after leaning the subject and read as much as possible to enhance knowledge.
Ranjan Prasanna directed Joe Abeywickrama in his one-episode debut tele-drama Paalu Thani Hudekalawa subsequently and the tele-drama was nominated for the award of Best Direction at Raigam tele-awards.
He made a range of tele-dramas to different TV channels afterwards.
Ranjan Prasanna in later years have worked with film directors, Jayantha Chandrasiri, Prasanna Vithanage, Budee Keerthisena, Udayakantha Warnasuriya and Sanath Gunatilleke to name a few as an assistant director to gain vast knowledge in filmmaking.
He clinched SIGNIS award for best assistant director for his contribution to the film Sinhawalokanaya.
Ranjan Prasanna talks fondly on the film Handaya directed by late Titus Thotawatte. He is currently planning to direct a full-length childrens film this year.

Sri Lankas revenue to up over 4 b Euro under GSP Plus: Harin
Sri Lanka will receive a revenue of over 4 billion Euro under the GSP Plus concession, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said.
He made this remark while addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday.
Fernando said Sri Lanka will receive immense benefits under the GSP Plus concession as the country will obtain a huge market potential. He said as a result of the notorious behaviour of the Rajapaksa regime, the country lost the GSP Plus concession.
As an outcome of losing the GSP Plus concession, the country suffered a lot including the closing down of factories and cutting down employments, he said.
According to statistics, more than 40 garment factories were closed. The financial loss was estimated to over Rs 1,500 million, he said.
He said the government does not care what the Joint Opposition says and does.
Fernando said the media suppression, assault on media personnel, failing to carry out law and order, unnecessary involvement in the judiciary and poor implementation of human rights resulted in the loss the GSP Plus.

Taking ties to new heights
The past week was critically important for Sri Lanka since it hosted two foreign dignitaries for the 14th International Vesak Day celebrations held in Colombo and Kandy. The celebrations initially inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ended with Nepal President Bidhya Devi Bhandaris presence at the closing ceremony in Kandy.
The regional focus was on Sri Lanka due to the presence of the Indian Prime Minister to inaugurate international Vesak celebrations. Nearly a billion people across the sub-continent would have watched Indian Prime Minister Modi delivering his speech on Lankan soil where he brought out the relevance of the Buddhas teachings in todays context. The world owes Sri Lanka for preserving unsoiled Buddhism were his emphatic words.
Although State visits by foreign leaders do not usually have political overtones and in this particular case it was for the sole purpose of participating in Vesak celebrations (apart from a public rally in the upcountry), that did not prevent the Joint Opposition from branding it as a working visit where several agreements with Sri Lanka would be signed. They had created an anti-India climate especially in rural areas by highlighting that the Indian Premier would be here for signing the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) and the Trincomalee oil farm deal. The Government categorically denied these accusations and as the visit unfolded it became clear that no such agreements were to be signed. Prime Minister Modi made a brilliant speech extolling the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma at the UN Day of Vesak inauguration.
The Joint Opposition chose vituperative language to oppose the arrival of Indian Prime Minister Modi. This job was foisted on Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila, who have a penchant to be in the forefront in all political melees.
During his May Day speech Weerawansa called upon the masses to hoist black flags as a mark of protest against the arrival of Prime Minister Modi on the Vesak day but none was seen in Colombo or elsewhere. People do enjoy his garrulous political rhetoric but may not consider him a serious politician. On many an occasion he had been virtually reduced to a political clown by his own actions. Starting from the famous fast unto death near the United Nations compound against the Darusman report on Sri Lanka, more recently he added another feat to his records by fasting inside the remand prison against the judicial order that denied him bail.
However his leader Mahinda Rajapaksa was quick to disassociate with Weerawansas sentiments when he told journalists he had no objection to Modis visit to Sri Lanka and qualified his statement saying as long as no agreements detrimental to the country are signed. By this time arrangements have been finalised to have a late night tete-a tete by the two leaders.
Indian investment in Sri Lanka
Prime Minister Modi met former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was accompanied at the discussions by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and former Foreign Minister G L Peiris. This meeting was not on the original agenda of Prime Minister Modi. Unlike Weerawansa, Rajapaksa has a better grasp of international geopolitics and knows that keeping communication lines open to the corridors of power in New Delhi is essential, regardless of whether one is in power or in the Opposition. Although no formal communiqu was issued by the Indian side, The Hindu reported on the meeting, quoting sources close to the former president, who was perceived by many in the Indian establishment as being very close to China.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi meeting former President Mahinda Rajapaksa during his recent visit to Sri Lanka.
The focus of the meeting, which began around 10.30 p.m. at India House in Colombo, was on economic and development projects, The Hindu said. Modi reportedly asked the former President what he thought India could do. Mr. Rajapaksa said New Delhi must encourage Indian investment in Sri Lanka to benefit the people, the source said, requesting anonymity. Tweeting about the meeting, Rajapaksa said: As always, a cordial meeting with PM @narendramodi yesterday. Happy to see him in #SriLanka for International Vesak Day Celebrations. #India.
Professor GL Peiris told journalists that he could not reveal the outcome of the talks between Prime Minister Modi and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. That is all confidential, he said. Media report also said that India had invited Rajapaksa but there lies a disability ahead of Mahinda Rajapaksa which disqualifies him from contesting for the Presidency again in terms of 19th Amendment to the Constitution. Opinions were divided on why Gotabhaya took part in the discussions, but commentators were of the opinion that he is being seen as a future political candidate due to his brothers inability to contest again and discussions of this nature would raise his profile.
Notwithstanding what Prof. Peiris said, Rajapaksa maintains the position that they never discussed politics. GL was thankful that the meeting was granted at short notice but diplomatic sources say that Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh met with Mahinda Rajapaksa ahead of Modis visit to Sri Lanka.
The Sri Lankan President too was in the know of the meeting that took place at the India House. The meeting however did not come as a surprise to many since Modi had developed some sort of acquaintance with Mahinda Rajapaksa over the years. Now it is a totally different political scenario with the Unity Government in power. Indias aim now is to cultivate President Maithripala Sirisena who is at the helm. It is more important to them for reconciliation efforts and to create a more conducive environment for the Tamil people in the North and the East and also for security in the Indian Ocean region where Indias concerns are quite visible.
The one major casualty of this meeting was none other than MP Weerawansa who ended up with egg on his face after the Modi-Rajapaksa meeting and Rajapaksas participation in the opening ceremony of the UN Day of Vesak. Cartoonists had a field day lampooning Wimal, who was depicted in most cartoons with a black loincloth covering his modesty.
Worse, by May 12 several websites had published pictures of his Hokandara residence, which did not have either black flags or Buddhist flags. Several television stations also showed the houses of other prominent JO members, none of which had black flags, though some had Buddhist flags and Vesak decorations. Weerawansa had since kept a low profile probably on the advice of his mentor, Mahinda Rajapaksa MP.
Estate sector population
Modi received a rousing reception from the estate sector population, most of whom are descendants of labourers brought from India for working in the tea plantations. Significantly, both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe addressed this gathering in Norwood in addition to the Indian Premier. The speeches were well received by the enthusiastic crowd, especially Prime Minister Modis reference to the late minister and plantation patriarch Saumyamurthi Thondaman.
Wimal Weerawansa
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) too secured a last-minute meeting with Prime Minister Modi at the Bandaranaike International Airport prior to his departure to India. All the leading parties of the TNA were represented, though the TNA did not extend an invitation to Northern Province Chief Minister Justice C V Wigneswaran. The TNA later explained that this was not a deliberate omission, but only the TNA party leaders were invited to the meeting with Premier Modi. They had discussed current political developments and urged India to exhort the leadership in Colombo to consider the re-merger of the North and the East and several other demands.
The other major development was the re-surfacing of speculation on the much-delayed Cabinet reshuffle. This is now expected to take place once Prime Minister Wickremesinghe returns from China, after participating in the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) Summit. Cabinet meetings have been suspended until a new Cabinet is announced. There is speculation that some portfolios could be swapped and new ministries given to certain key players of the 2015 Rainbow Revolution who had seemingly been not been given major portfolios. Sources in the UNP and the SLFP say differences between the two sides on a Cabinet reshuffle have been ironed out.
Incidentally, Minister Sujeewa Senasinhges presence at religious ceremonies held in connection with the demise of former President Rajapaksas younger sister set off a flurry of talk in political circles as Senasinghe had publicly expressed his dissatisfaction at the status quo of the UNP, saying he had been sidelined. He has also threatened to quit politics, but said he would never leave the UNP. Any talk of a defection is premature as an election is not on the immediate horizon but this should serve as a reminder to the UNP to take care of the younger leaders who had played a major role in the electoral transformation of 2015.
With a national election due only in 2020 and no fixed date for the Local Government elections, all parties have turned their attention to political maneuvers in the Provincial Councils, though elections to at least three of these are also due this year. The parties are vying to take over the Councils by certain balance of power manipulations, but many Constitutional experts have pointed out that there is no provision in the Constitution or in the Provincial Councils Act for such a transfer of power.
North Central Provincial Council
The two PCs in question are North Central and Central. The crisis in the North Central Provincial Council (NCPC) was precipitated by 18 United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) councillors deciding to work independently, with most of them, if not all, actually supportive of the JO. Their reason for the decision was the NCPC Health Minister K H Nandasenas removal on Wednesday and the resignation of the Trade Minister S M Ranjith. SLFP officials said these members had been promoting another party, a clear reference to the JO, instead of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) of which they were members. In fact, Nandasena was seen at the JO May Day rally at Galle Face Green.
This does not in itself lead to a change of power (in essence, a new chief minister) at the Council, unless they join the main opposition in the Council, the UNP (which has 11 members and the JVP has one) because the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) has the majority in any case and the newly independent MPs also function within that group. This is similar what happened in Parliament, where the JO was not recognized as another political party or given the Opposition Leader Post by virtue of the fact that they still represent the UPFA.
According to the Provincial Council Act, only the General Secretary of the ruling party of a given PC has the authority to change the Chief Minister. The only other way another group could change the administration of a PC is by defeating the budget. In the NCPCs case, there is no impending budget and its term is expiring in 4 months any way. The NCP Governor has already rejected a petition calling for the ouster of Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne and replacing him with S M Ranjith.
A crisis seems to be brewing at the Central Provincial Council too. UPFA member Pramitha Bandara Tennakoone, who relinquished his ministerial portfolio recently in protest against the removal of his father from the party organisers post, said steps will be taken to change the power equation in the council. Sensing an opportunity, the UNP members of the Council said they are ready to take over power in the CPC, but this has been shot down by CM Sarath Ekanayake who has accused the UNP of daydreaming.
Meanwhile, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa does not want to destabilize the Provincial Councils (PCs) administered by the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya told the media.
Both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe are aware that focusing on their respective parties internal problems could take their attention away from the greater governance issues. Thus they have to resolve inner-party problems while smoothing out any ruffled feathers vis--vis the other partner in the National Unity Government.
Geethas Parliamentary Seat
MP Geetha Kuamarasinghe has received a stay order from the Supreme Court with regard to the appeal court verdict on the annulment of her Parliamentary Seat. It was quite unusual for the Supreme Court to take up Leave to Appeal matter in such a hurry counsel for the petitioner respondents, J C Weliamuna told a three judge bench of the Supreme Court when it was taken up on Friday.
It is usually the Registrar of the Supreme Court who looks into these matters. Under normal circumstances it never happens and for ordinary citizens that privilege is not available, Weliamuna who is billed to take oaths as a Presidents Counsel shortly told Court. He requested Court not to make any order since there was no time to study the appeal papers. Deputy Solicitor General Janaka de Siva who appeared before the Court expressed similar sentiments when he said that it should not incline towards making any order since time did not permit him to study the matter and he was informed of Court notice by the Secretary General of Parliament a short while ago.
However Respondent Appellant Geetha Kumarasinghe who retained Romesh de Silva PCs submissions prevailed. The Court issued an interim order stalling the verdict of the Court of Appeal order till last Monday, which unseated Geetha Kumarasinghe by way of a quo warranto. On Monday it came up before a different bench comprising Justices Eva Wanasundera, Gamini Abeyratne and Anil Gunaratne. Once again the Court stalled the operation of the Court of Appeal order this time until the final determination of the matter. It was revealed by the State that that there was evidence to substantiate that Kumarasinghe was a dual citizenship holder. The crux of the argument of Geetha Kumarasinghe was that he Swiss citizenship was not intentional and she received it through her marriage.
The Court however decided after a respite by majority decision to stall the operation of the order of the Court of Appeal while Justice Anil Gunaratne declined. The earlier stay order prevented the Chairman of the Election Commission from acting upon the written communication by Secretary General of Parliament. The case also went down to September which will allow Kumarasinghe to sit and vote in Parliament. However many are of the opinion that this important constitutional issue should receive priority attention of the Apex court with a fuller bench since otherwise people will feel that justice delayed and justice is denied.
Other MPs having the same issue will be watching the developments in this case with much interest since their seats are also at stake. However, apart from MP Basil Rajapaksa, no other MP has admitted to being a dual citizen and some, like Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, have rejected allegations on dual citizenship. Some commentators have pointed out that the dual citizenship issue would only affect Parliamentary elections and any dual citizen can still be a candidate in other elections.
Concerted efforts are being made to address the SAITM (South Asian Institute for Technology and Medicine) issue which has been severely disruptive. The Government has requested SAITM not to admit any new students until concrete and viable policies on private universities are formulated, while the Neville Fernando Hospital will be taken over by the Government. SAITM is likely to continue as a separate entity, albeit one listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. An administration board will be appointed to oversee SAITM and any other private medical university. Discussions on these issues will take around eight weeks. The GMOA which had earlier announced a strike over SAITM, cancelled it on the request of several other trade unions, as a grenade attack was revealed on the Sri Lanka Medical Council premises. The grenade had not detonated. The GMOA and other trade unions have requested the Government to nab the culprits within one week. In the midst of all this, a solution to SAITM acceptable to all could be in the offing soon.

Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov up close
As the 20th century loomed, the number of composers who saw the day, were the brilliant masters destined to mesmerize the world of classical music. Each had his own forte not surpassing the other and played in a world of his own, some turbulent and others gentle and smooth but all enchanting. We had a choice: a great choice to select our own favourites from Russia across to Europe and the choice was unlimited. There was Dvorak who wrote his NEW WORLD SYMPHONY, a favourite of mine as well as all the ballet scores of Tchaikovsky. There was also the lilting FOUR SEASONS by Vivaldi, Beethovan's Symphony No. 3 (EROICA) Mozart's SINFONIA CONCERTANTE (K364), and all THE REQUIEMS by the masters. The list is endless but with the lesser known Johann Pachelbel's CANON in D remaining my favourite for ever.
Last week two great masters were brought together by The Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka with the Earle de Fonseka Trust and boarded at the Lionel Wendt Theatre with two of our great players on strings along with Russian pianist, Maxim Puryzhinsky who is in Sri Lanka for the second.
Sadly, I missed this opportunity to hear two of my favourite composers being played, especially by violinist, Ananda Dabere and cellist, Dushyanthi Perera, being confined to bed with the dreadful flu. I was looking forward to hear Puryzhinsky on the keyboard.
I never miss any concert at which Ananda Dabere play whom I consider the best in the country with a tinge of magic filled with enduring harmonic flicks and flounces that reminds me a bit of Frank Peter Zimmermann of the London Philharmonic Orchestra as first violin whom I have seen on many occasions because like him Dabere plays with an extra profundity that seem to reach heavens on strings but I believe that Dabere remain our own home-grown genius who need not and must not be compared with another even as great Zimmermann.
Being Russian, Puryzhinsky opted playing the glorious Tchaikovsky and the eccentric Rachmaninov whose works would simply have melted on strings on equal terms as on the keyboard. Among some scores wore:
Tchaikovsky - The Seasons Opus 37 A, No. 5
- Strait Nights
- Meditation in D Minor
PETER TCHAIKOVSKY
He needs no introduction both in ballet and music for students, teachers and conductors around the world. This great genius learned the piano late into childhood because he was to become a lawyer. In his late twenties, he realized where his talents were when his father packed him off to boarding school along with brother, Modest.
He had a good education and a French governess. He failed to secure a post at the Ministry of Justice and declared not suitable enough that made his father realize Tchaikovsky's interest lay only in music and a piano was secured for the purpose of a late start. In the mean time his mother had died. Thereafter, he followed his teacher, Nicholas Zaremha to the St. Petersburg Conservatory and two years later, invited to the teach harmony at the Moscow Conservatory for which, he lived with Nicholas Rubinstein.
He started to emerge as a talented composer but was held back by signs of neurosis he developed from the age of six by listening to music. By the time he wrote Symphony no. 01 and Winter Daydreams, his nervous disorder surfaced, especially a numbness in hand and feet. Even colitis, hypochondria and hallucinations seared him.
He was of opinion that his head would fall off if he conducted an orchestra. Like brother Modest, he was feeling the sense of homosexuality that bothered him and to overcome, a pretty 28 years old music student called Antonina Milyukova who had been threatening him with suicide, if he did not marry her, married her.
It was a total disaster and five days later, he was not in a position to scotch the current rumaurs because Antonina started blackmailing him. Later, she was confined to an insane asylum where she died in 1917. However, his guardian angel, Nadexhda von Meck continued to support him. After an illustrious and brilliant career, he died of a highly contagious disease.
He was unconscious at the time of his death and kept calling out the name of Mme von Meck. She died two months later in Germany.
SERGIE RACHMANINOV
If Tchaikosky was a neuro, Rachmaninov was an eccentric and both given to the healing power of philosophy. Infact, he consulted a psychologist for hyphnosis therapy.
His aristocratic and expensive father was a pianist from a land-owning community but like others sold the assets to upkeep the family. That did not deter him from his onward journey as pianist, conductor, composer all rolled into one with much success.
It Tchaikovsky failed in his marriage for success, Rachmaninov steadied his life by his marriage to cousin, Natalie Satina who was to play an important part in his life and success that led him to be a professional pianist in America where he arrived at the late stage of his life and became a citizen. A few weeks later, he died of cancer and buried in Kensico Cemetery, New York.
Very few pianists equaled his playing that rose from the bottom of his heart. His innovative art with boundless joy came off an eccentric soul. Never at ease, Rachmaninov sailed into each and every heart inspite of the criticism leveled against his playing and composing during his lifetime.

Ten million LED bulbs for low income electricity users
The government will provide 10 million LED bulbs to 3.9 million low income electricity users in a bid to reduce their electricity costs.
Over 40 percent of electricity users in the country use less than 90 units of electricity. These households mostly use incandescent light bulbs which consume 70 percent more power than an LED bulb.
We found that from 6.30pm- 10.30pm, electricity consumption rises significantly. We have to spend a lot to manage this demand. This high consumption is mainly due to the use of incandescent bulbs among this group, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said yesterday.
The minister addressing the media at the ministry said the new programme would allow those in low income groups to voluntarily switch to LED bulbs in a more cost effective manner.
The bulbs would be ordered through an international tender process. We will assure that users are given a five year warranty period for the bulbs, he said.
The cost of the bulb will be recovered from the users through the energy savings made in their bill within two years, the minister said.
Electricity meter readers would monitor the cost savings and make deductions, he said.
Siyambalapitiya said the new scheme would help reduce the costs of electricity to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) in four months.
The drought in many parts of the country despite the recent respite in the rains, has affected the cost of electricity. The minister said in the first four months of this year, the CEB had to bear an additional cost of Rs. 27.5 billion to meet a continuous supply of electricity.
Our reservoirs are at 28 percent capacity. If the drought continues, by the end of June, we would have to spend at least Rs. 50 billion on oil to generate electricity, Siyambalapitiya said.
The minister had requested the President to either cut down the tax on fuel supplied to the CEB or to cover the additional costs through the Treasury.
The Cabinet agreed to cover some of the costs and has approved Rs. 5 billion to cover costs, Siyambalapitiya said.
The ministry has asked farmers to use their water pumps for agricultural purposes from 10pm-5am to be eligible for a 50 percent reduction in their electricity bills.
The ministry is promoting a smart metering system where users can voluntarily opt for a new smart meter at a cost. They will be charged according to a time of the day tariff. These users would be charged Rs. 13 per unit between 10.30pm-5.30am, Rs 25 per unit from 5.30am-6.30pm and Rs 54 unit from 6.30pm to 10.30pm.

UDA seeks court order to dismantle Galle stadium buildings
The UDA and the Archaeology Department will seek a court order to dismantle buildings in the Galle Cricket Stadium.
These buildings obscure the view of the historic Galle Fort, a world heritage site, official sources said. The UNESCO had threatened to strike off the Galle Fort from the list of World Heritage sites on several occasions blaming the government for its failure to file legal action against these unauthorised constructions which hamper the view of the Fort, they added. Although the previous regime had given UNESCO an undertaking to dismantle these structures it had not materialised.The UNESCO had recently accused the government of its failure to carry out this assurance and given a final warning that it may have to strike Galle Fort out of the list of World Heritage sites unless the buildings were removed.
Official sources said the UDA had already finalised arrangements to seek a court order to dismantle the said buildings.
An official attached to the Galle Heritage Foundation said the Archaeological Department will petition court against these constructions while the UDA which is the authorised institution handling the dismantling of unauthorised constructions had also finalised arrangements to file a court case in this regard.
Legal action will be taken against the trustees and owners of the Galle cricket stadium soon, he added.

Walk to remember
Among all living beings, only humans have the ability to walk on their hind limbs. To walk straight, a few metres or many a kilometre. A myriad actions could be performed with the feet whilst walking. To kick, to hop, to skip whether we walk forward, backward or sideways. Man can walk briskly, leisurely, with hands in his pocket, chatting, exercising, gesticulating, carrying little ones or heavy bags and at the same time to see all whats happening all around him.
The only walker non human on its hind limbs is our tuxedo attired artic / antartic domiciled penguin. Walking on webbed feet with a wobbly gait like those who perambulate on the rubberised or concerted highway after taking on overdose of you know what. A flightless bird that walks on ice.
Of all the walks, we recall with reverence, the walks of our celestial teachers. The lovely walk on seven lotus flowers by Prince Siddhartha. The walk of Lord Jesus Christ on the waters of the Sea of Galibee. Then, the walks of our hallowed teachers on mother earth preaching. Their immortal words to all mankind. Their disciples walked amongst the multitude. The pious followers of the Buddha walked serenely looking down at their toes. Devotees walk round the Holy Kaaba in Mecca.
We walk around the sacred Bo trees in the Island. Walk up the Holy Mountain Sripada, walk up hills simulating the walk of Jesus Christ up to the summit of Calvary. Beautiful humans walk round the corridors of the temples at Trichendur, Thirupati, Kataragama and make a lovely walk up to the Relics of the Buddha in Kandy. All these walks are brought to our minds while walking down memory lane.
The walk makes a triumphant entry into the lives of humans during their short sojourn in this life, when we take our first steps on mother earth amidst smiles, tears, clapping and clicking of cameras. Then grandpa and ma take their gem for a short walk. A snails walk for all three.
Toddler's walk
The toddler has a walk. The grandparents too may need walkers at time. The word walk has many suffixes and prefixes and phrases that give many a meaning. A walking tour with knapsack on your back. A mouthorgan or tiny tune producing mobile phone make walking move enjoyable then tours by air, train or road. To be with nature and fellow men. Lingering walks, recording the chatter of birds with the aid of a modern day mobile phone. We cross the road. Never run, they say. If the road is clear, walk briskly, after looking to the right and left.
We walk up to the rostrum. Walk back to the chair. Walk with ones chin up. Then the walking race with gyrating hips and buttocks hands swinging away does really look amusing. A walkover for the favourite in competitions.
A proposal, a nervous youngster walks into an unknown home. A consensus. All in captures. The lucky young man walks back on air. The wedding. The young couple walk up to the poruwa or altar with their parents. Next, the happy duo walk back into the embrace of their loved ones as husband and wife.
Memories of pre nuptial walks and songs. Walking my baby back home, and Ill walk beside you. Walk takes pride of place. It will linger on till the newly weds walk into a new home of their own.
Space walk
Then the slow walks with smile so love, hope and prayers for the arrival of the little angel. All walk softly up to the cot for a glimpses.
Astronauts did a space walk. Not a dash or a run. In the days of sea pirates, wrongdoers had to walk the plank. A walk that took them into the depths of the ocean. Brings memories of an award winning film, shot on location in Ceylon. Elephant walk. A mansion is built on the path taken by roaming elephants an elephants walking path is obstructed. They walk in hordes.
The mansion crumbles. The elephants walk is back for their walks. Then comes the last walk in modern times. A slow, pathetic, walk of no return by those condemned to death. They walk in tears, perhaps thinking of a beloved mothers walk to a ward to bring forth amidst tears of pain and joy a son who has now turned to sin.
Under normal circumstances, man is unable to foretell where and when his last walk will be still we cannot avoid it. I is with man. You are serene in death, in a horizontal position. Mourners walk up to the bier.
Pay their respects, walk back. Next they walk behind their silent kin or friend. Pall bearers walk on either side of the casket. A few walk carrying the silent one. At times on their shoulders. A funeral band or drummers walking in steps before the deceased. Relatives walk round the grave or the pyre. The ordained walk back to their respective places of worship. Nephews walk round the pyre carrying the lighted torches. A sad and silent crowd walk out of the cemetery.
Walk is an endearing gift given to man. Let us pray that this system of perambulation by man will be a source of relaxation and joy till the end of time.

Zero Duty, market access to EU under GSP+ from Friday
The European Union has decided to grant Sri Lanka enhanced market access under GSP+ from Friday (19) as a reform incentive.
Sri Lanka will re-acquire GSP+ status this Friday, European Unions Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Tung-Lai Margue, told journalists in Colombo yesterday.
The GSP+ decision will be published in the official journal of the European Union on Thursday. That means one day after the publication exports from Sri Lankan manufacturers will be allowed to enter the EU without any Customs duties, Margue said. He said the EU will remove a significant part of the remaining import duties on Sri Lankan products entering the EU market in exchange for the countrys commitment to ratify and effectively implement 27 international conventions on human rights, labour conditions, protection of the environment and good governance. These one-way trade preferences will consist of the full removal of duties on 66% of tariff lines, covering a wide array of products including textiles and fisheries. The removal of duties will come into force the day after publication in the official journal of the EU, he added.
Margue remarked that GSP+ will create great incentives to increase Sri Lankan exports to the EU, which is already the countrys biggest export market.
In 2016, EU imports from Sri Lanka totalled 2.6 billion euros, and Margue noted that this number will grow larger with GSP+.
The direct benefits based on present exports to the EU will be roughly 300 million euros per year, and this could of course increase and reach 1 billion euros in a few years, he said.
The exporters of garments and textiles, rubber products, small machinery, fisheries, food products and tea stand to gain the most from the improved trade status, according to the Ambassador.
He also remarked GSP+ will help reduce Sri Lankas trade deficit and encourage Sri Lankan companies to diversity their exports due to their increased competitiveness in the EU market.
While there are myriad direct benefits that come with the reduction of tariffs, Margue stressed than an indirect benefit of GSP+ is to make Sri Lanka a more attractive country in which to invest.
We expect more foreign companies to invest in Sri Lanka and start business, especially manufacturing businesses. This will mean more jobs available for Sri Lankans, he said.
The Ambassador added that it is the EUs hope that the benefits of GSP+ will reach people in parts of the country that were most affected by the conflict, especially the Northern and Eastern Provinces, as well as women.
The EU is launching a project worth 8 million euros over five years to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to bring their products upto EU standards.
The granting of GSP+ is based on the country showing that it is continuing to make progress towards effectively implementing 27 international conventions on human rights,labour conditions, protection of the environment and good governance.
There will be a stringent, bi-annual monitoring process to make sure that Sri Lanka continues to progress.The first such report is due in January 2018.
Sri Lanka has the chance to benefit from the trade scheme until it achieves upper middle income country status for three consecutive years. Based on current trends, that should mean that Sri Lanka will benefit from GSP+ until at least 2021,Margue said.

Rajapaksa regime sold many state lands to foreign companies
Gampaha District MP Kavinda Jayawardana said 18,370 acres of land were sold to various foreign companies by the Mahinda Rajapaksas government, but the Joint Opposition (JO) led by Rajapaksa makes a huge cry that this unity government is going to sold state lands to foreign companies.
Not a single perch of land was sold by the government. It never sells any state lands to foreign companies.
But the JO makes baseless allegations that the government is going to sell state lands to foreign companies, Jayawardena said.
He was addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday.
It was revealed that 18,370 acres of state lands were sold to many foreign companies during the Rajapkasa regime. Of that, 18,370 acres; 1,500 in Ulhitiya, and 1,200 in Pelawatte were sold to foreign companies during the Rajapaksa regime.
In Monaragala, 5,000 acres were sold to an American company. Another 5,000 in Somawathiya was sold to the same. A Singaporean company purchased 20 acres at Galle Face for a hotel project and another 50 in Hambantota were sold to the same for a hotel project. In Hambantota, 500 acres were sold to the Hambantota Port City Project and 5,000 to the Hambantota harbour project, he said.
He said these lands were not rented out or leased out for 99-year or 33-year lease period but sold outright to foreign companies during that time.
When the government was taking measures to restructure the Hambantota harbour a few months ago, the JO made allegations that the government is going to sell the harbour.
The government is duty-bound to convert the Hambantota port into a profit -making venture as it has become a huge burden to the countrys economy, he said.
He questioned JO members why they kept silence when the Rajapaksa regime sold lands to foreign companies.
The JO members are misleading people for petty political gains.
But the general public have clearly understood JOs Dawal Migel Re Daniel role, he said.

Ransomware attacks to augment insurance protection demand
The slew of recent ransomware attacks in over 150 countries reveals the widening scope of corporations cyber risk exposures, which is likely to increase demand for related insurance protection, Fitch Ratings says.
Insurers are in a unique position to assist customers in addressing the cyber threat. However, a cautious approach to adding cyber exposures is warranted as there is considerable uncertainty in pricing and underwriting this risk. Aggressive expansion by individual underwriters into the segment could be credit negative.
Tallying the costs from recent attacks will take time. However, growth in corporate anxiety from cyber-related threats amid regular reports of data breaches and other information system intrusions will spur demand for cyber protection and solutions including insurance protection. Furthermore, compliance with developing regulations will likely increase the demand for coverage.
Insurers are playing an expanded role in countering the cyber threat, utilizing traditional expertise in risk management and claims services. They are also gaining more technical expertise in cyber threat testing and prevention and post-event resolution through acquisitions or alliances with cyber security vendors. Cyber protection coverage, therefore, increasingly includes a service and advisory component, as well as insured loss limits.
Besides cyber extortion and ransomware attacks, cyber-related events may include systems hacking, data theft and denial of service attacks. These events may create economic losses from damage to systems and property, remediation costs, lost revenue due to business interruption and reputation damages.
No ransomware threat to computer users in SL
Information and Communication Technologies Authority (ICTA) assured that the cyber attack spread across the world has not affected Sri Lanka and internet uses do not need to worry. ICTA is closely monitoring this issue and if there is any threat to computer users in Sri Lanka they will duly notify them, ICTA CEO Muhunthan Canagey said yesterday.

M. H. Kariapper
Mohamed Nizam Kariapper was born in Kalmunai and hails from the historic and ancestral Kariapper Family from the Eastern Province.
His father, the late M. H. Kariapper too was a lawyer who practised in Kalmunai and later became a judicial officer and retired as a Grade 1 District Judge.
He had his primary education at a Buddhist temple in Kalmunai, which was later known as Kalmunai Sinhala Maha Vidyalaya. Having passed the Grade Five Scholarship Examination, Kariapper entered D S Senanayaka College in Colombo, where he sat for his Advanced Level examinations successfully.

Australia might not have Ashes team  Warner
Australias Ashes series against England in November could be in doubt because of a players contract dispute, says vice-captain David Warner.
In March, Cricket Australia proposed salary increases for men and women, but this would mean players no longer receive a percentage of CAs revenue.
The offer was rejected and CA said it would not pay players after 30 June.
Warner told the Age newspaper: If it gets to the extreme, they might not have a team for the Ashes.
A stand-off has developed between CA and the Australian Cricketers Association (ACA), which represents the players.
Ex-Australia captain Mark Taylor said the players were prepared to strike over the proposals.
If the dispute is not resolved, there would be uncertainty over what team Australia could field after 30 June, with a two-Test series scheduled in August in Bangladesh before a home Ashes showdown which runs from 23 November 2017 to 8 January 2018.
That 30 June deadline also falls in the middle of the Womens World Cup, which takes place in England between 24 June and 23 July - and Australias elite female players have shown solidarity with their male counterparts over the dispute despite CAs March offer to double the elite womens pay.
A Cricket Australia spokesperson told BBC Sport: CA is ready and willing to negotiate with the ACA.
In a letter sent by CA to the ACA, chief executive James Sutherland said players with contracts expiring in 2016-17 will not have contracts for 2017-18 unless the ACA negotiates a new Memorandum of Understanding.
We want a fair share, and the revenue-sharing model is what we want, so we are going to stick together until we get that, added Warner, currently playing in the Indian Premier League. We are not going to shy away; we are just going to stick together.
We want to keep participating for our country as much as we can, but if we dont have a job, we have to go and find some cricket elsewhere.
International boards need to put their hands in their pockets
Former England captain Michael Vaughan believes the dispute could be the first of many to affect the international game.
Its great for England to see Australia falling out and fighting with each other but in terms of the game as a whole its not a great story, he said on BBC Radio 5 Lives Tuffers and Vaughan Show.
Ive never seen it to this level. Its sad for the game when youre hearing this but I dont think it will be the last case of players getting together as groups. Theres so much money coming through TV deals, I think players will say we fancy a piece of that.
International boards have got to put their hands in their pockets to save international cricket. In our day, international cricket was the sole money-maker for the game but the Twenty20 leagues are catching up.  BBC

Australian Border Force vessel visits Sri Lanka
The Australian Border Forces largest patrol vessel 'Ocean Shield' arrived at the Trincomalee Port today as part of an official visit to Sri Lanka recently.
This is the first visit by an Australian Border Force vessel to Sri Lanka.
It observes long-standing record of close cooperation between the two countries to stamp out people smuggling across the region.
The Ocean Shield is one of Australias offshore vessels that conduct far-reaching patrols and responds to illegal activities including people smuggling, illegal fishing and transnational crime. Commander of Operation Sovereign Borders Air Vice-Marshal Stephen Osborne is accompanying Ocean Shield during the visit. He said Australia is very grateful for Sri Lankas on-going support to combat people smuggling.
Over the recent years, we have worked together to save many lives at sea and prevented vulnerable people being ripped off by people smugglers, Air Vice-Marshal Osborne said.
We value our strong relationship with Sri Lanka and this visit provides an important opportunity to advance our cooperation and share expertise on a wide range of maritime concerns. Air Vice-Marshal Osborne said it has now been more than 1000 days since the last people smuggling boat made it to Australia.
Australias borders are now stronger than ever, and our tough border protection policies are here to stay. Australia now operates the largest and most capable maritime surveillance and response fleet Australia has ever deployed. Anyone who attempts to reach Australia illegally by boat will be detected, intercepted and turned back. There is a right and a wrong ways to travel to Australia. I encourage anyone who is thinking of getting on a people smuggling boat - do not put your life at risk or waste your money. Settlement in Australia will never be an option for anyone who attempts to travel to Australia illegally by boat. There are no exceptions, Air Vice-Marshal Osborne said.

Ben Johnson ad slammed for glorifying drug cheats
Sydney: A controversial commercial by an Australian sports betting company featuring disgraced sprinter Ben Johnson has been slammed by the government for glorifying drug cheats.
The 90-second advert by gambling firm Sportsbet introduces Johnson, at a desk surrounded by a medal and a trophy, as the 1988 Olympic gold medallist while attempting to make light of the scene by superimposing *For 48 hours below the fallen star.
When it comes to performance enhancement Ben really knows his stuff, which is why he is happy to endorse Sportsbets new juiced-up Android app, the narrator says, claiming the firms phone betting application was putting the roid into Android.
Australian Sports Minister Greg Hunt blasted the ad as sending a message that cheatings okay and should be rewarded and laughed at and glorified.
Theyre glorifying a drug cheat and theyre paying a known drug cheat a huge princely sum of money, he told radio station 2GB late Monday.
So its an insult to clean athletes and, frankly, my view is they should pull the ad and they should pay the same amount to junior sport as they paid a known drug cheat.
Johnson was stripped of his 100-metre gold medal in the 1988 Seoul Olympics after testing positive to steroids.
The Canadian is joined in the advert by a range of drug-cheating stereotypes, including a cyclist in a yellow jacket, a muscular swimmer and a Hulk-like body builder.
The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority said it had registered an official complaint.
This advert makes light of the use of performance enhancing drugs in sport and sends the completely wrong message that the use of drugs in sport is normal, the doping watchdog said in a statement.
This advertising campaign belittles the achievements of clean athletes and denigrates those who work to protect clean sport across the world.
Sportsbet laughed off the controversy.
The outrage is so severe you could roast a marshmallow on it, the firm said on its website.
There was just one problem with all of this public outrage though. The public didnt seem to be outraged at all. In fact, people kinda liked it, Sportsbet added, pointing to dozens of social media posts endorsing the commercial. AFP

BOI woos Czech investors
The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and Czech Republic Business Mission held a series of meetings to discuss possibilities of greater economic co-operationin Sri Lanka, especially in the area of investment.
The visiting Czech delegation was led by Ivan Jancarek, Junior Deputy Minister for Non-European Cooperation who was on an official visit to Indonesia and Sri Lanka.
The Deputy Minister led a delegation of 11 business entities which included leading Czech Companies including banks and companies engaged in manufacture as well as various the developments of infrastructure projects.
The first meeting was the Czech-Sri Lanka Business Forum held at the Hilton Hotel which served as an introduction to the other discussions.
The forum was inaugurated by Ambassador Hovorka who is accredited to Sri Lanka but based in New Delhi.
According to the Ambassador, there is also need to build up trade between the two countries; Sri Lankan enterprises should look at the possibility of developing trade with the Czech Republic.
Ivan Jancarek, Deputy Minister, who followed, highlighted the commonalities existing between Sri Lanka and the Czech Republic.
Both are middle sized countries with the Czech Republic having a population of 10 million people against Sri Lankas 22 million.
Currently there was about US$78 million worth of trade which could be further developed. The Minister stated that what the Czech Republic could offer Sri Lanka was knowledge, trade, technology and also the fact that it was part of the European Union, the worlds largest trading block.
The next speaker was Borijov Minar the Vice President of the Czech Chamber of Commerce who described some of the business opportunities available and also the composition of the visiting trade delegation.In his address he stated that the Czech Republic is a leading exporter of machinery to Sri Lanka while his country imports textiles and tea from the Island.
The delegation was interested in taking business opportunities forward and in particular in identifying and entering into joint ventures withreputed Sri Lankan enterprises.
Minar noted that the delegation consisted of some of the leading Czech enterprises in areas such as energy, wine production, banking and other sectors. Well-known Czech Companies Skodaand Jawa were also present.
Upul Jayasuriya, Chairman of the Board of Investment briefed them on the political transformation that the country had undergone since January 2015. Jayasuriya said that Sri Lanka was the second country in Asia to start an open economy, in 1977 just after Singapore and long before countries such as India, Malaysia and China.
He also added that as Chairman of the former Tractor Corporation, he was very familiar with products made by then Czechoslovakia which supplied Sri Lanka with a large number of tractors.
Whilst these were reputed products, they were not assembled in Sri Lanka. Products such as these tractors are now needed in Sri Lanka since the process of mechanized farming has begun, but still have a long way to go.
He welcomed the Czech delegation to look at fresh new opportunities in Sri Lanka. Czech companies are free to engage in business on their own without needing a local partner.
Czech Companies may look at setting up Regional Headquarters in Sri Lanka.In the case of industry for example all capital goods and raw materials are free of custom duties. Furthermore profits can be repatriated free of charged. BOI also assists with handling of custom issues as well as exchange control matters.
Jayasuriya welcomed Czech investors to the BOI and the following day the Czech delegation headed by Minister Ivan Jancarek visited the BOI where they were welcomed by the Chairman and Senior Officials of the BOI.
Jayasuirya stated that the BOI is overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of the delegation from the Czech Republic and it was important for that country to see Sri Lanka as a gateway to the South Asian Region.

Breakfast meeting on Treasury Bond issuance comes to limelight
The much spoken about breakfast meeting which took place on February 23, 2015 at the Central Bank premises prior to the questioned Treasury Bond issuance, came to the limelight again yesterday.
Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva questioned Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe at the Presidential Commission Inquiring into the Treasury Bond Issue, on the events that took place at the breakfast meeting.
At the breakfast meeting, it is reported that a sudden government requirement was discussed, resulting the decision regarding the 30 year Treasury Bond transaction worth Rs. 10.5 billion.
When the State Counsel questioned Dr. Weerasinghe regarding the meeting on a previous day, he said that the discussion never reached a conclusion that a certain amount of money should be raised to meet the government requirement.
Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva questioned him on this statement at the Presidential Commission Inquiring into the Treasury Bond Issue yesterday.
Chanaka de Silva produced a letter signed by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. The letter stated that a decision was taken to raise Rs. 75 billion to meet government requirements following the breakfast meeting.
When asked as to why such a letter was produced, de Silva said his client, former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran requested for the letter.
De Silva was questioned if he wishes to summon Minister Karunanayake as a witness regarding the issue at hand, to which de Silva said he does not, but if the Commission does, so be it.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera said the Attorney Generals panel wanted a background check on the letter and the letter did not have a date.
De Silva agreed on the AGs panel conducting a background check on the letter. When questioned on the letter, Dr. Weerasinghe said the content of the letter is wrong. There was no such a decision made at the breakfast meeting to raise Rs. 75 billion. De Silva also asked Dr. Weerasinghe if he submitted a report on the March 3, 2015 at a meeting held at the General Treasury regarding certain road development projects. Dr. Weerasinghe said he did and also mentioned that there was no such conclusion as to raise a Rs. 75 billion.
Meanwhile, de Silva also questioned Dr. Weerasinghe on the Market Operations Committee (MOC) meeting on February 27, 2015.
De Silva asked if former Governor Mahendran did or did not bring with him a newspaper article saying that 1 billion USD has been released to the market by the Central Bank. Dr. Weerasinghe said it is difficult for him to make a statement on it as he does not remember such an incident.
However, de Silva suggested that the decision to remove 5 percent penal rate at the MOC meeting came as a result of an attempt to stop the Rupee depreciating against the released 1 billion US Dollars.

China invests $124 bn in belt and road global trade project
The Chinese government is investing tens of billions of dollars as part of an ambitious economic plan to rebuild ports, roads and rail networks.
China's President Xi Jinping has pledged $124bn (96bn) for the scheme, known as the Belt and Road initiative.
"Trade is the important engine of economic development," Xi said at a summit of world leaders in Beijing.
The plan, which aims to expand trade links between Asia, Africa, Europe and beyond, was first unveiled in 2013.
Part of the massive funding boost, which is aimed at strengthening China's links with its trading partners, includes 60bn yuan ($9bn; 7bn) in aid to developing countries and international institutions that form part of the Belt and Road project.
Xi used his speech to assure Western diplomats that the plan, described as the new Silk Road, was not simply an attempt to promote Chinese influence globally.
"In advancing the Belt and Road, we will not re-tread the old path of games between foes. Instead we will create a new model of co-operation and mutual benefit," Xi said at the opening of the two-day summit.
"We should build an open platform of co-operation and uphold and grow an open world economy," he added.
A Chinese idea but for everyone's benefit. That's how Xi presented his Belt and Road vision to drive trade and prosperity through Chinese built infrastructure.
President Putin of Russia and President Erdogan of Turkey were among those applauding from the front row as the Chinese leader talked of a big family of harmonious co-existence and pledged billions of dollars in loans and investment.
But neighbours Japan and India have stayed away from the summit, suspicious that China's development agenda masks a bid for strategic assets and geopolitical ambitions. And some economists are cautious about the viability of projects in areas of political instability and poor governance.
In his keynote address on Sunday, Xi ignored the doubters.
He talked of a new model of win-win co-operation, an implicit bid for Chinese global leadership at a time when other big economic powers like the United States and the European Union are preoccupied with internal problems.

Colonial Motors introduces legendary Vespa in premium looks to Sri Lanka
Colonial Motors recently re introduced the legendary Vespa to Sri Lanka.
The VXL and SXL offer refreshing styling, in a range of attractive, bright colours as expected. Theres a choice of matte shades too, for those that dont subscribe to a glossy finish on their scooter. The VXL and SXL show off smart alloy rims, with single side suspension front and rear. There are hints of chrome here and there on these well-equipped scooters.
The palm grips are comfortable to hold, and the VXL and SXL scooters come with top-quality switches and chrome body mirrors, these easily adjusted and offering good vision. Theres a city light facility offered, along with a smooth functioning, spring loaded, push-to-cancel indicator operation switch. A set of machined alloy front and rear brake control levers look good as well.
The VXL and SXL share digital instruments consoles, with analogue speedometers. Among the features a clock, tripmeter and fuel gauge as standard with the new Vespas. There are handy storage cubbies below both handlebars, as well as under the long, well-padded riding saddle. The VXL and SXL offer ribbed footwells, with a raised central section your feet may take time getting used to fitting around; a small price to pay for these scooters true-blue retro style.
Other subtle differences between the VXL and SXL are the S losing a grab bar at rear, and offering different seat lining, darked out wheels, a rectangular headlight and mirrors.
The VXL and SXL feel like top-quality scooters, with excellent paint lustre and an impressive level of fit-and-finish.
The Vespa VXL and SXL scooters come with four-stroke, 150cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled and carburettor-fed engines, that run three-valve heads. Power output is 11.5bhp at 7,000rpm, while maximum torque is a healthy 1.17kgm at 5,500rpm. CVT transmission systems allow seamless, hassle-free riding on the road, and worked perfectly throughout ride.
Crucially, the new enhanced-capacity 150cc engine works to make a big difference on the road, experienced in the nippy manner in which both, the VXL and SXL accelerate, with strong grunt as you start off from a halt at low revs and a more robust feeling mid-range. Cruising at speeds of up to 70kph is a breeze, and feels more relaxed as compared to other smaller engine-equipped Indian scooters. Theres also excellent refinement and unblemished smoothness, just as expected and available with every Vespa scooter sold in India today.
In addition to these larger powerplants, Vespa is also offering the VXL and SXL in 125cc, three-valve engines.
The VXL and SXL come with monocoque steel frames, as do all Vespas sold around the world. This helps the latest Vespas feel solidly put together, with a nice, rigid feel when riding, more so when zipping around two-up, with a pillion. Riders are seated in a comfy, upright position that is roomy enough. The VXL and SXLs single-sided, hydraulic shock absorbers front and rear work well to provide plush ride quality, never feeling too firm or overly soft.
To match their bolstered performance, the VXL and SXL come with lower profile, tubeless, Maxxistyres that grip the road better, and allow easy handling with a quick flickability other scooters struggle to match. Then you have 11-inch rims in front, resulting in quicker turn in. 200mm rotor-equipped front disc brakes, coupled with 140mm drum brakes at rear work well to provide effortless stops, with progressive bite at the levers.
The VXL 150 and SXL 150 make sense in world, for riding them convinces us these new Vespas do now pack in the value to back up the premium pricing. How so By delivering solidly on the key aspects of style and overall quality, being well equipped and walking the extra mile in terms of a peppy, stronger performing, refined engine that outdoes other scooters.

Communalist elements cannot form governments - President
It is only a political movement that ensures social justice to all communities including Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims which can form governments in the country in future, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
A person thinking on communal lines can never form a government in this country, President Sirisena said addressing a meeting after opening a new three storeyed building at the Kaduruwela Muslim Madya Maha Vidyalaya on May 15.
President Sirisena who emphasised that all people should live in unity and brotherhood as people of one country said they all should act with intelligence and understanding and beware of extremist elements in all communities who were trying to sow the seeds of disunity by creating tensions.
The President said community, religion or political party should not be a criterion in allocating funds for development work since such allocations should be based on the needs and requirements. Educational development was essential to produce knowledgeable and disciplined citizens who could promote development in the country.
The government was ever willing to allocate funds needed for the development of material and human resources in the education sector.
He said there should not be communal divisions in education since the government treated all children alike without communal distinction.
He said construction work on the proposed harmony school which would enable children of all communities to pursue education together, which is being gifted by the Indian Government at his request would be launched this year.
President Sirisena who arrived at the Kaduruwela Muslim MMV received a cordial welcome from its students. The President opened the new building by unveiling a plaque.
The new building is part of the Rajarata Navodaya - Pibidemu Polonnaruwa district development program initiated by the President.
The President also distributed prizes among students who had shown excellence in there studies.
North Central Province Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne, Parliamentarian Sydney Jayaratne, Principal A. Iqbar and members of the tu tonal staff and parents were present.

Competitiveness of South Asias container ports increases - World Bank
South Asia has had outstanding economic growth in the last two decades and could grab a bigger share of international trade, but inefficiencies in its ports threaten to hinder progress and stop it from matching other regions like East Asia, a new World Bank report shows.
While some South Asian countries took great strides to improve performance at container ports amid a worldwide boom in sea-borne trade, the region as a whole has lagged and its ports are seen as expensive and slow, the report said.
The comprehensive World Bank study of the status, structure and deficiencies of the regions container ports found that if ports in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan had been as efficient as those of Sri Lanka it could have cut shipping costs by up to nearly 9 percent, boosting the value of the regions exports by up to 7 percent.
As China is shifting out of labor-intensive sectors such as apparel, South Asia has the potential to capture a growing share of the global market.
This may in turn attract more foreign direct investment, increase trade and create new jobs for South Asias growing labor force.
But tapping into these opportunities will require removing bottlenecks in transport logistics, last mile connectivity, and ports in particular, to reduce the high logistics costs in the region, said Jose Luis Irigoyen, Senior Director, Transport and ICT Global Practice at the World Bank.
Overall South Asia has improved the performance of its container ports, but still struggled to catch up with other developed and developing regions, report author Matas Herrera Dappe said.
South Asia has reduced the performance gap with East Asia, but because of remaining inefficiencies and lack of infrastructure it costs about twice as much to import a container as it does in competitor countries in East Asia.
Average ship turnaround time for the region, at more than two days, was more than four times that of Singapore.
The report recommended the countries - Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka - to build greater private sector participation, improve governance of port authorities and create more competition within and between ports.
Experience from across the globe, including the South Asian experience, indicates that a comprehensive approach that tackles several interrelated angles yields greater benefits than isolated improvements, said Karla Gonzalez Carvajal, South Asia Manager, Transport and ICT Global Practice at the World Bank.

Contempt of Court case against Gnanasara Thera fixed for argument
The Contempt of Court action filed against Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court amounts to Contempt of Court on January 25, last year was yesterday fixed for argument by the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal two-judge-bench comprising Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice H.C.J. Madawala fixed the case for May 24.
At a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera against the amended charge sheet.
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had referred the Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire such a complaint.
On a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence which comes under Article 105 of the constitution.
On a previous occasion, a charge sheet signed by Court of Appeals President Judge had been served on the accused.
In a surprising turn of events, on January 25, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda was over.
Later on, Gnanasara Thera was arrested by police on the charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
Through the contempt of Court action, the Homagama Magistrate has sought Appeal Courts jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court.
He further sought Courts jurisdiction to take necessary legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.

Extremists remove bricks from archaeological pillars: Gnanasara Thera
Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera said yesterday that Muslim extremists have removed bricks from archaeological pillars at the Somawathiya and Jala Gelum Nimnaya conservation sites to use them at cattle slaughterhouses.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, the Thera urged the government to take action against this practice.
Muslim extremists with the support of politicians are engaged in illegal tree felling, sand mining, treasure hunting and hunting of animals in the conservation sites, he said.
But the Sinhala people who are protesting against these practices are being
arrested by the Police. We urge the President to end this destruction. There are slaughterhouses in the area. If the government would not intervene to solve this problem, the BBS would forcibly remove them, he said.
The conservation areas are full of animal skeletons. Extremists have cleared thousands of acres illegally and destroyed the building of the archaeological sites. But, the political leadership of the country remains silence as they want the support of Muslim politicians, the Thera said.
Archaeology Director General said the department does not have sufficient funds to preserve archaeological sites.
The Thera urged the philanthropists to spend their money to preserve archaeological sites. Most archaeological sites do not have sign boards and fences around them, he said.

Fair courage
Traditions can be classified as a belief, principle or a way of acting that have evolved and derived from various social, ethical, and philosophical and mainly of religious and theological background. Being a multicultural and a multi-lingual nation, Sri Lanka owns a rich culture along with a deep heritage and history. Even though slightly modified over the generations, people still follow the age old customs and traditions reverently. Many a tradition of the country is attributed to social life although they are carried out in different ways and forms according a persons caste, creed and position. Throughout the month of April, young and the old alike witnessed and celebrated the Sinhala and Tamil New Year the most feted festival which brings harmony among the Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minority of the country. A vast number of customs and rituals are carried out during this period strengthening relationships among families and relations.
Perfect atmosphere
Before the season of festive concludes, the Girl Guides Association organized `Aththamage Kusalatha Tharagaya 2017- an inter province competition consisting of various traditions practiced by Sinhalese and Tamil communities. The event was aimed at furnishing the young girls with traditional skills such as paddy pounding, rice winnowing, scraping coconut, using the grinding stone, boiling of Jak fruit, making Pol Sambol, making kevum, kokis, modhagam, decorating the oil lamp, drawing rangoli and many more. To carry out these events they chose an ancient house known as Polhena Walawwe built in 1910. The house stands among the many mango, coconut, rambutan, banana and jak trees providing the perfect atmosphere for the celebration of traditions of the villagers.
This is year Girl Guides Association celebrates hundred years in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka Girl Guides Association, a member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girls Scouts was introduced to Sri Lanka in 1917 by Methodist Missionaries. Being a Methodist school, Girls High School Kandy became the place to commence the movement. Girl Guides Association had two major events to celebrate the centenary under the tag line `1000 days to 100 years. We honoured and recognized the leaders who had been volunteers from their young age to old. The centenary grand awards ceremony was held in February at the BMICH. Then we had a huge rally with the participation of 6,000 girl guides at Bogambara grounds. It was a clourful pageant and a giant birthday cake of 330 kilo grammes was made by a girl guide to celebrate the event, Deputy Chief Commissioner, SGGA, Visaka Tillekeratne said.
We have a duty to develop the individual guide. We want to give a place to the girl child to grow up in her own atmosphere and become a future leader. She needs to come out on her own without any fear with independent thinking. Once a girl joins our movement, she remains our responsibility as a Girl Guide she added.
Tillekeratne added that this event was organized to impart the traditional skills women possessed. At this event both Sinhalese and Tamil students have to learn the skills that are unique to both cultures. A Tamil girl guide should know to make traditional Sinhalese food items while the Sinhalese girl guides learn to make modhagam. In this way we assist in preserving the traditions without even a seed of disharmony keeping up with the Guides policy of living in harmony, she said.
The movement has been empowering girls and young women for a centenary and spans over all nine provinces. It is open to girls and women from all walks of life irrespective of caste, religion and race. Our projects are based on values and are society oriented. They offer non formal educational programmes focusing on community development, environmental awareness, primary healthcare, drug abuse, prevention of girl child, adolescent pregnancies, HIV/AIDS and integration of differently abled into normal society. They stress on leadership training to encourage girls and young women to make their own choices in decision making at all levels, Tillekeratne added.
Exemplary person
Aththamma at this event is attributed to Sirimavo Bandaranaike who holds a record unmatched by any person in this country and for that matter in the world as the worlds first woman Prime Minister. She was a girl guide during her education at St. Bridgets Convent from 1924 to 1934 and ran the senior guides company at the convent. She was an exemplary person who enriched her life with the skills learnt as a guide throughout her life, she said.
The chief guest at the event was Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the Former President of Sri Lanka who at present chairs the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation which formulates and implements policies and programmes to build national unity and reconciliation. As the daughter of the worlds first woman prime minister and herself being the first woman President of Sri Lanka, she reminisced how Sirimavo Bandaranaike used to make traditional Sri Lankan dishes during their young days. She knew how to make the traditional curries and mastered embroidery and sewing. She had exposure to many political leaders, visiting dignitaries and foreign diplomats during her life time, and she played the hospitable, charming hostess whenever it was needed. These talents and qualities must have been mustered her by being a girl guide in her school, President Kumaratunga said.
Empowered confidence
Her education at the St. Bridgets Convent under the catholic nuns molded her life even though she was a devout and a practicing Buddhist. Being an active girl guide undoubtedly prepared her for effectively tending a home and raising a family and also in being a remarkable character in her political career, Former President added.
She also said that the impact Sirimavo Bandaranaike had on the politics of the country was enormous. She was stern in her decisions. Nobody could change her decisions. Sirimavo Bandaranaike had been a keen social worker since her youth and she had visited poor villages to try to raise living standards of the women, President Kumaratunga said.
Former President also commended the valuable service rendered to the society by the Girl Guides Association and encouraged the young guides to continue to equip themselves with skills and there by empowering themselves to emerge as future women leaders of the country.
Few girl guides clad in camp uniform who were taking part the competition also shared their ideas. Tashya Stefeni, 17 and Dasuni Nirmani, 17 from Sapugaskanda Visaka Vidyalaya said the skills they acquire through the projects and camps give them the confidence to face life. We visit homes for the elders, clean temples and participate in lot of society oriented activities. They enrich our lives. We also learn to handle daily chores of a woman such as cooking and washing our own clothes. It prepares us to be better in the future, they said.
Girl Guides is all about surviving with what you have. When we go for camps we boil water in tins and make snacks for ourselves. We learn to put up tents and we are given minimum things to manage. Camps and hikes give us vast experience. We also get to interact with guides from other parts of the island which makes us get to know their cultures and ideas. Not only locally but we also go on tours to other countries which gives us the international exposure. Overall it helps us develop our skills and prepares us to survive where ever we may be, Yadusha Ravindran, 14 and Isuri Chandrasiri, 14 of Lyceum International College said.
Girl Guides Association have lined up several other events such as the Vesak festival and an international camp in Ampara District to celebrate their centenary year.

Finagle Lanka commenced exporting frozen baked products to the Maldives several years ago. Although there are a few bakers who currently export to markets in developed countries, they are only in small quantities.
Finagle however is now exporting its own frozen baked products to the USA by the container load.
Finagle was selected as the baker of choice due to the consistent high quality of its products. The current shipment is for Los Angeles buyer Prince International, who will in turn distribute the consignment to 22 states in the USA.
Since all products are frozen, all that is required is to defrost and reheat any one or several of the diverse products, to enjoy a typical Sri Lankan meal or snack which is guaranteed to provide enjoyment and satisfy the palate of the Sri Lankan and Asian consumers and give other communities a taste of our cuisine. Finagle Lanka has obtained ISO and HACCP certifications, and can therefore be confident that all products meet the highest standards of quality and hygiene. No other Sri Lankan bakery has the ability, or capacity, to freeze baked or par-baked products for export.
Finagle serves a host of hotels and allied food outlets throughout the country as well with its range of products.

Free Public WiFi for 1 mn by end 2017
Sri Lanka would target one million free internet users by the end of this year through the Free Public WiFi program, said Information and Communication Technologies Authority (ICTA) CEO Muhunthan Canagey.
Speaking to Daily News Business at the launch of Disrupt Asia Start Up Conference and Showcase yesterday, he said that they would add 500 more public Free WiFi Hotspots by the end of this year.
Asked to comment on the taxes that were imposed at the 2015 budget for the ICTA sector he said that though additional taxes were levied to the users, Sri Lanka still remains the cheapest in the world. People must also remember that the government is not taxing the online payments made to purchase goods which come directly to the customer.
Even if the goods are collected through post officers there is no tax. Similarly for online services too, the government is not taxing customers, he said.
He however said that they would make an appeal to the Finance Minister next August to bring down some of the taxes imposed on internet and cellular phone usage bills.
He also said that ICTA together with the government would ensure that all state institutions including hospitals would be IT savvy by the end of next year and the government is investing over Rs 6.5 billion for this project to wire up the public sector. We have already started this program and 550 government offices and institutions are already covered under this program.
We will add 200 more public entities by the end of this year to this program,he added.
The event will also serve as a platform to connect attendees with high impact entrepreneurs and thought leaders, network with the stakeholders of the ecosystem, acquire knowledge and make a positive impact on themselves and the ecosystem as a whole.
ICTA Chairperson Chitranganie Mubarak said, Startup entrepreneurship is crucial for economic growth  not only because of the innovations it brings in, but also because of the new job opportunities it creates and because of the competitive dynamics it brings into the business environment.
But for this to happen we need a fairly decent, robust startup support ecosystem.

Frostbitten by climate change
It is now an established fact that the root cause of rapidly increasing changes in climatic conditions across the world is a rise in the concentrations of heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
According to NASA scientists, this decades-long trend of rapidly increasing average global temperature is continuing, and is aggravated with Arctic sea ice decline.
Through the Sri Lanka NEXT initiative, the Government of Sri Lanka is committed to achieving a sustainable development pathway that delivers broad-based economic growth while also contributing to the global fight against climate change. While the reduction of emissions is now given priority by progressive nations worldwide, the United Nations has been supporting the Government of Sri Lanka to find practical ways to safeguard and maintain the islands forest cover through the UN-REDD Programme for nearly four years.
The UN-REDD Programme, which is the United Nations collaborative initiative on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD), is currently supporting 64 developing countries with preparing and implementing forest-based national strategies aimed at combatting the threat of climate change.
This global programme was launched by the UN in 2008 and builds on the convening role and technical expertise of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
Spearheaded by the Forest Department, Department of Wildlife Conservation and Climate Change Secretariat, a multi-stakeholder consultative process of the Government of Sri Lanka has resulted in the National REDD+ Strategy, which is named the National REDD+ Investment Framework and Action Plan  NRIFAP.
The first copy of this document was handed over to President Maithripala Sirisena by the UN Resident Coordinator Una McCauley at a ceremony held at the BMICH recently. Completed as a five-year, US $ 99 million strategy, financed mainly through international sources, NRIFAP provides 13 specific forest-centric policies and measures for implementation by the Government of Sri Lanka.
Indicating Sri Lankas absolute commitment to follow a low-emission pathway, President Maithripala Sirisena stated that: Since forests play the unique role of converting harmful emissions into harmless carbon, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) is recognised as a global solution to greenhouse gas emissions. As the Minister in charge of environment in Sri Lanka, I also consider this a national priority.
Endorsing the implementation of REDD+, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that: As the Government of Sri Lanka plans to implement REDD+ in Sri Lanka, we would also like to invite the international community to partner with us towards an enterprise that aims at restoring the countrys eco balance while preserving the environment.
During the four-year period of development of the strategy, a civil society platform, indigenous peoples forum, academic and research forum, and a private sector network have been established to support the government to implement REDD+ in Sri Lanka.

How to use your smartphone wisely
Nine hours. Thats how much time college students spend on their phones each day, according to a recent study published in the Journal of Behavioral Addictions.
Its not entirely surprising. Whether youre waiting in line for coffee or out watching fireworks overhead, it seems like everyone has their phone out in some capacity. Its as if we prefer the confines of a pocketable screen with the world only in peripheral.
Nearly two-thirds of Americans use a smartphone, says Pew Research. That means that two out of every three people you will interact with today will have a smartphone, whether it is for work or personal use, or both. Some will be considerate with their phones, and others will be rude or downright dangerous. Which would you rather be We hope you said considerate! If so, here are 12 ways for you to use your smartphone wisely: Keep your phone off the table when having coffee or a meal with friends or business contacts. Keep your focus on the people youre with. If you must check in, take a call or look up information, let your guest know this in advance, and ask if an interruption is OK.
Dont check your phone during a meeting. Keep it out of sight, in your pocket, briefcase or bag. Whether you are meeting someone one-on-one or in a group, silence your phone and notifications, instead of putting your phone on vibrate.
You can check in after the meeting. Except for emergencies, very few situations require your immediate attention. Make work-related contacts during work hours.
For example, dont follow-up with a prospective employer or job candidate after business hours unless youve agreed to that in advance. This shows that you respect their time, and ideally, theyll return the favor when contacting you.
When using your smartphone in public, be sensitive to those around you, whether you are in the grocery store, walking down the street, or riding the train into work. If you are texting or talking for more than a few seconds, make sure you move out of the way and that you arent disrupting someone elses work or privacy. And, of course, NEVER, EVER, EVER talk or text while driving. Dont use your phone in a checkout line at a store or in the teller line at the bank. Show your respect by waiting until youve finished your business to use your phone. Reply to emails, texts and instant messages within 24 to 48 hours. If you are unplugging, let those close to you know that so they arent concerned if you dont reply within a reasonable time frame. Auto-correct can be your best friend or a beast.
Proofread your texts, instant messages and emails sent from your smartphone before hitting send, no matter how urgent your message might seem. Its worth the extra time. If you dont believe us, Google auto-correct blunders. Dont text in front of others. Wait until youre alone. Be prudent when posting to social media accounts. Will you regret that post later Will it offend someone, particularly a prospective employer or employee While wed love to separate our business and personal lives, it can be difficult to do online, so make sure your posts are consistent with your personal branding. The same is true of emails. Bonus tip: Avoid religious and political posts. Dont tag someone in a photo or share a photo, or news of someone else, without their permission. Dont use a Bluetooth device in public. People dont know you are on the phone with someone else and may assume you are talking to them. Talking on a Bluetooth in public also means they can hear your end of the conversation which may not be appropriate, even if it seems innocuous to you.

India doctors allow 10-year-old rape victim to abort

A panel of doctors has accepted a 10-year-old rape victim's plea for an abortion in the northern Indian state of Haryana.
Ashok Chauhan told the BBC the termination would be carried out "anytime now".
The girl became pregnant about five months ago. She alleges rape by her stepfather, who has been arrested.
Indian law does not allow terminations after 20 weeks unless doctors confirm the woman's life is in danger.
The decision to allow the child to abort was taken after a local court told doctors at the Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) in the town of Rohtak that it would accept their recommendation.
India is home to the largest number of sexually abused children globally. But there's a general reluctance to talk about the problem and it's rarely discussed in public.
Studies have shown that in large numbers of cases, like in the case of the 10-year-old rape victim in Rohtak, the abusers are known to the children and include care-givers like parents, relatives and teachers.
Contrary to the popular belief that only girls are abused, boys are equally at risk; and children from affluent families are just as much at risk as those from poor backgrounds.
Campaigners say sexual abuse of children goes unchecked because the victims are often afraid to report it to their parents or teachers, and also because parents themselves often hush it up, fearing family dishonour.
But in recent years India has been waking up to the problem and on Tuesday, child rights charity World Vision India launched a new campaign to end child sexual abuse by 2021.
The campaign aims to impact five million children across 200 districts and calls on every Indian citizen to work to break the silence that surrounds child abuse.
Campaigners say India's culture at present stands on the side of the offender, and that must change.
The tough law against abortion was introduced to fight India's skewed gender ratio. A deep-seated cultural preference for sons has led to millions of female foetuses being aborted over the years by pregnant women after undergoing foetal gender testing.
In recent months India's Supreme Court has received several petitions, some from women who were raped, wanting to terminate pregnancies after 20 weeks. The court has always referred the matter to medical experts.
The scale of abuse in India
A child under 16 is raped every 155 minutes, a child under 10 every 13 hours
More than 10,000 children were raped in 2015
240 million women living in India were married before they turned 18
53.22% of children who participatedin a government studyreported some form of sexual abuse
50% of abusers are known to the child or are "persons in trust and care-givers"
Sources: Indian government, Unicef
In the latest case in Rohtak town in Haryana, doctors from the Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) accepted the family's request to allow the child to have an abortion after discussing the matter on Monday.
The pregnancy came to light last week when the 10-year-old's mother, who works as a domestic helper, suspected her child was pregnant and took her to see a doctor.
Reports said the girl was often left at home when her mother went to work. She told her mother that she had been repeatedly raped by her stepfather, who had warned her not to say anything.
The stepfather was arrested after the mother lodged a police complaint, senior Rohtak police official Pankaj Nain told the BBC.
Dr Chauhan had said on Monday the case for the termination was "borderline".
"She is around 20 weeks pregnant, but it could be 19 weeks or it could be 21 weeks. The technology is not so advanced that it can tell you exactly what week she's in."

The Japanese connection
[Book Review]
Title: Iasthura
Translator: Daya Ananda Ranasinghe
The book is a translation to Sinhala of an English Novel Ironwood Tree by Paul Pieris. It gives the picture of the folk in rural area during the time of foreign invaders. It carries the story of Japanese Bombing Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday and how Colombo families dwell in country for security and feeling the difference of comfortable nature than concrete walls surrounded.
A very readable book, Ironwood Tree describes real events in Sri Lanka during World War II, with the use of fictional characters. It has elements of a spy novel and a love story  plus, brimming with humorous situations! Set during the Colonial Period when Sri-Lanka was under the yoke of the British Empire rule. Paul Pieris subtly explains how the British rule was challenged by the Japanese attempt to conquer Asia.
It shows life as it was over 60 years ago in this country, showing the impact the war had on the general population.
One noticeable impact being the master-servant relationship - both the ruling English with the native population and also the master and man/woman servant at home. The novel beautifully describes this period in Sri-Lankan history, with anecdotes and even little mini stories from the country's past.
Read this novel, and you will be taken aback by the poetic use of language, full of feeling and understanding. The novel's undercurrent is the fear of an impending invasion by the Japanese, culminating with the Japanese bombing of Colombo, the capital city - incidentally, by the same fleet that nearly destroyed the American Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbour in Dec. 1941. The translator, Daya Ananda, now domiciled in England, was attached to Lake House in 1970s. He has also worked with Titus Thotawatte and Lester James Peiris.
His write-ups were highly commended at the OCIC Cinema Festival and in 1982 he was commended by the Germany, Manheim International Cinema Festival. He was the Editor of the Lanka Vitti in England for over ten years published in favour of the Sri Lankans living there.

JO confident of capturing several provincial councils - GL
The Joint Opposition said it was confident of capturing power not only in the North Central Province but in several other provincial councils as well, if the need arises.
The battle to capture power in the North Central Province is a sign of things to come JO member Prof.G.L.Peiris said addressing the media in Colombo.
Peiris said the JO was confident of capturing power in the North Central province shortly although the Governor refused to entertain affidavits submitted by 17 pro-JO, UPFA MPs calling for the removal of the chief minister on Monday.
He said the government was trying various underhand tactics to win back the dissident Councillors and added that the shifting of allegiance by one UPFA member who signed an affidavit against the North Central CM on Monday was due to such efforts.
The provincial councillors, like the public in this country are fed up with this government which is heaping more burdens on the people almost on a daily basis.They are now ready for a change and we will give leadership to it he added.
Prof.Peris said that the terms of North Central, Eastern and Sabaragamuwa provincial councils will expire in September and the government has no alternative but to go for elections.
Peiris said that the government will not be able to postpone the PC polls as they have done with the LG polls and added that the JO will launch a street struggle if the government strives to do that.

Literature in Hudson Valley
The Hudson Valley in New York is known for two things: its ridiculously beautiful foliage in the fall, and for the attraction it holds for literary folks. This region sits a couple hours north of New York City and often gets overshadowed by its larger, more bustling city neighbor.
However, writers from Washington Irving to Nova Ren Suma to Joshua Ferris to Carol Goodman havent pulled inspiration from the Hudson Valley for their books just because it happens to be around. The Hudson Valley hosts a plethora of places to visit for any literary lover  and I would know, having lived there for my entire life.
BOOKSTORES
There are a dozen beautiful bookstores in the Hudson Valley, and the first one on your list of places to visit should be Oblong Books & Music. Okay, I am a little biased towards this one  its where I work!  but Oblong keeps winning the Hudson Valley Magazines Best Bookstore award for a reason. Oblong has two locations.
The original store is located in Millerton on the very edge of the Hudson Valley, a sleepy little town with dozens of destinations for foodies and art lovers. The second store is in Rhinebeck, a cozy little town with huge tourist appeal that boasts award-winning restaurants and three candy shops, including one co-owned by actor Paul Rudd. (Book Riot also listed the Rhinebeck location as one of the best bookstores in New York.)
Love a good drink Head to Spotty Dog in Hudson. The bookshop not only offers an excellent selection of books, but it doubles as an bar, with an excellent list of local hand-crafted ales and wines.
In Warwick, youll find Ye Olde Warwick Book Shoppe. The adorable store, which sells both used and new books, is modeled after an old-fashioned Victorian book shop in its furniture designs and colors.
You can get two-for-one if you visit New Paltz. On one side of a street is Inquiring Minds, a cozy little bookshop for new books that offers both a frequent buyer program and discounts for students at SUNY New Paltz, a ten-minute walk away. On the other side of the street is Barner Books, which has served the New Paltz community for 25 years.
Filled brim-to-brim with mostly used books, the shop is a delight to browse and also features a selection of handmade journals.
Merritt Bookstore in Millbrook hosts an incredible selection of books. They also help host the Milbrook Literary Festival on May 20th, which will host authors from Min Jin Lee to Iza Trapani.
The Golden Notebook sits in the heart of Woodstock, NY  right next door, nicely, to a local ice-cream store. The adorable little shop hosts a wonderful selection of new books and has an excellent selection of books about the local area.
HISTORY
One of the perks to driving through the Hudson Valley is that you pass a lot of beautiful old houses, and more of them have literary ties than you may think. A lot of them are also open for visitation. Edna St. Vincent Millays house Steepletop is now the Millay Colony for the Arts, an artists residency located in Austerlitz, New York.
While aspiring authors can apply for their retreats and workshops, folks who want to visit can call ahead to take a look at the houses and estates.
When you think of the Hudson Valley, you think of Sleepy Hollow. Located in  shocker  Sleepy Hollow, the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery is open for visitation every day of the year. It also hosts guided tours, whose first stop is always the grave of the infamous Washington Irving himself.
A hop and a skip away from the cemetery is Sunnyside, Washinton Irvings home. Fans can sign up for hour-long tours hosted by folks in period garb that will take you through Irvings life and around the beautiful estate.
The Olana State Historic Site was the home of of Hudson River School painter Frederic Edwin Church. Churchs Hudson River School paintings can be found in stunning collections, but Olana has the perk of having a mystery novel  Glenda Rubys Death At Olana  that you can read as you visit the absolutely stunning estate.
Love old libraries Then head straight to Hyde Park, where the Roosevelt mansion  known as Springwood  overlooks the Hudson River.
The estate is beautiful to walk around, but one of the highlights is the F.D.R. Library and Museum, which contains dozens of historic documents. (And though not directly related to books, a five-minute drive away is Vanderbilt Mansion, an equally stunning estate with a beautiful rose garden.) Mark Twain fans can also head to Elmira, New York to visit his library study and visit his grave at the nearby Woodlawn Cemetery.
Though its not quite a historical house, youll also find Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. Vassar College is the alma mater of dozens of poets and writers, including Elizabeth Bishop, Marianne Moore, and the aforementioned Edna St. Vincent Millay. Their campus is open and has the delightful perk of looking like New Yorks Hogwarts.
While hes not my cuppa tea, fans of James Fenimore Cooper can shimmy up to the top point of the Hudson Valley and visit Cooperstown. The town drips with Coopers touch. The most notable of those places is the Fenimore Art Museum, a 1930s mansion built on James Fenimore Coopers early 19th century farmhouse, and the James Fenimore Cooper Society, which displays Coopers memorabilia.
OTHER LOVELY PLACES
Part of the beauty of the Hudson Valley is all of the places outdoors to walk and explore  and those include places inspired and named after literary folks. The Sherman Park in Peekskill is named after the poet Frank Dempster Sherman.
The Poets Walk is a two-hour long walking trail located in Red Hook, named in honor of Washington Irving and other poets and writers who pulled inspiration from the shady, stream-side path.
For aspiring writers or people who want a behind-the-scenes on the craft of writing, there are other places where you can sign up for classes. The stand-out is the Hudson Valley Writers Center, which is located in Sleepy Hollow and offers both events to the general public and courses specifically for writers. - Book Riot

Macron wins Merkel backing to shake up Europe
GERMANY: Frances new President Emmanuel Macron secured backing Monday from key ally Chancellor Angela Merkel for his bid to shake up Europe, despite scepticism in Berlin over his proposed reforms.
Travelling to the German capital to meet the veteran leader in his first official trip abroad, Macron used the opportunity to call for a historic reconstruction of Europe.
During his campaign, Macron had thrown up ideas on reforming the eurozone, noting that the currency bloc cannot go on as it is if it wanted to avoid falling prey to protest and populism.
Among reforms he wants to see are setting up a separate budget for the 28-member group, as well as giving it its own Parliament and Finance Minister.
But the proposals have sent alarm bells ringing in Berlin, and initial relief about his victory against far-right leader Marine Le Pen had quickly given way to fears about his reform plans.
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble warned that such deep-reaching reforms would require treaty changes, which were not realistic at a time when Europe is hit by a surge of anti-euro populism.
Saturdays edition of weekly news magazine Der Spiegel featured a cover picture of Macron with the headline expensive friend.
But at a joint press conference following their talks, Merkel adopted a conciliatory tone and offered what appeared to be a key concession.
From the German point of view, its possible to change the treaty if it makes sense, she said.
If we can say why, what for, what the point is, then Germany will be ready.
Germany and France are the eurozones two biggest economies.
Merkels approach underlined her view that it was crucial not only for France, but for Germany, to help Macron succeed -- a point that she has repeatedly stressed.
Yet it remains to be seen if her approach would go down well in Germany, which is deeply adverse to shouldering burdens of eurozone laggards.
Macron sought to bat away German fears on debt, saying he was opposed to mutualising old debt between eurozone countries.
However, he signalled readiness to look at sharing future burdens.
I am not a promoter of the mutualisation of old debt within the eurozone, said Macron after meeting Merkel, adding however that the joint financing of future projects should be considered.
Underlining the concerns over Macrons proposals, Germanys biggest selling daily Bild warned ahead of the French leaders meeting with Merkel that before seeking deeper EU integration, France must once again be at the same level as Germany politically and economically.
Only then can the EU be reformed or develop deeper integration, it said.
The priority for France must be to loosen the jobs market, to simplify the highly complicated pensions system, to trim the civil service, it said, placing any investment from Germany secondary. - AFP

Maduru Oya right bank development takes place this year  President
President Maithripala Sirisena said the development work of the right bank of Maduru Oya will be implemented this year.
The President was speaking at the ceremony to offer 10, 000 deeds to the settlers of the Mahaweli C and B zones held on May 15 at the Vilayaya Maha Vidyalaya, Aralaganwila.
The Mahaweli settlers were granted 100,000 deeds under the Livelihood Development Programme by the President.
The President said the government has implemented a large number of mega projects to develop irrigation and agriculture in the country.
President Maithripala said 600 tanks in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Kurunegala, and Trincomalee will be renovated assisted by the Asian Development Bank.
He said the government is now resolving the water issue of the Rajarata people through the Moragahakanda Project - a long term demand of the regional people. They will not have a water issue after filing the reservoir with water in the Maha Season. the President said. The former government spoke about a mega development. But the debt burden of that development has now become a critical problem when taking the country forward, the President said.
He said the government has implemented a comprehensive development programme to take the country forward by freeing it from the debt burden.
We will bring in economic development by taking the programme forward rapidly facing any challenge, he said.
The President said some are dreaming to topple the government. He said some people talk about forming a new government after the May Day rally in Galle Face.
"They observe the rally and by seeing the supporters transported by buses to the Galle Face grounds, think that they can topple the government and it is a joke," the President said.
President Sirisena said he was informed that some people who asked people to hoist black flags when the Indian Premier arrived in Si Lanka, visited him at midnight.
Necessary equipment for the Livelihood Opportunities Development Programme was provided during the event.
Schools and temples were provided with water purification systems and water containers.
The Maha Sangha, religious leaders, Uva Provincial Governor M.P Jayasinghe, Minister Daya Gamage, NCP Chief Minister Peshala Jayarathne, Deputy Minister, Sudarshani Fernandopulle, former minister, P. Dayarathne, Provincial Councillor, Sampath Sri Nishshanka, Ministers and MPs, Mahaweli Authority Director General, and Polonnaruwa District Secretary participated.

Magic of being held by the world
Right now, as you read this article, you are being held up by an invisible, magic web.
Consider the following, with gratitude in your heart:
You are reading an article written for you by me, sent across the Internet thanks to the work of thousands and thousands of engineers and power workers and workers in computer factories, using a computer device produced by thousands of people around the world.
You are alive because you ate food and drink produced and delivered and served by thousands of people. You have shelter built by thousands of people (when you consider the manufacturing process), powered by a power system where thousands of people work every day, with water coming to you produced by thousands of people, cable (or Internet) entertainment streamed to you that was produced by millions of people. Your furniture, clothes, appliances, car, roads, work buildings, city were all built by millions of people.
When you were born, you were incapable of living without the support of your family, who fed, clothed, sheltered you, changed your diapers, kept you alive every single day. They were supported by many others, and then you were educated by many more. You were raised by a village, no matter what your childhood was like.
Your entire existence has been supported by millions of people, for your whole life, including right now.
And its not just your physical existence: your thoughts have been influenced by writers, pundits, TV shows, films, music, educators, friends and family, the work you do with others, politicians and government, philosophers and religious figures, the environment you live in. What you think and who you are is not something you just invented, it has been created by everyone and everything around you.
You have been co-created by every other human being alive, by the entire world. And your actions have co-created those around you as well.
You are held up by an invisible, magic web of human lives and thought, of food and shelter and electricity and devices, of human creation and nature and the cosmos around you. We co-create each other, every moment. And we take it all for granted. The only reasonable response to this realization is gratitude. Applause. Joy.
We are all connected, and our actions matter. How can you co-create the world around you today What loving action can you take right now, to care for others around you, to make their lives better What can you do to appreciate and show gratitude for those who have supported you
Fill your heart with love for those who have created you, and fill their lives with your love so you can create something amazing for them.
