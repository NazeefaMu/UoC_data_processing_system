INSEE Cement announces price increase
In view of the increasing cost of raw material and other production expenditure, INSEE Cement announces that the company had to increase its MRP (Maximum Retail Price) by Rs. 30 per bag. The retail price of a bag of cement will be Rs. 960/- with immediate effect. (The price of a ton of cement will be increased by Rs.600/-)
These price increases have been approved by Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) with effect from 23rd Feb 2018 and will be adopted across INSEE Cements product portfolio. The local cement manufacturers and importers of cement had lodged applications for price increases due to increasing costs which the industry had absorbed over the past 5 years.
Jan Kunigk, Executive Vice President / Commercial Director of INSEE Cement explained, The crude oil prices had doubled over the last two years to US$ 60 per barrel and the coal prices had increased by 30% in 2017 alone. Both these are essential inputs for manufacturing cement locally and import of cement.
In addition to the increase of these cost, the country also increased wages by 10% per annum over the last few years due to rising inflation and depreciation of the LKR against US$ by a minimum of -3% every year, all of which have a compounded impact on the company. Therefore, to remain competitive amidst these tough conditions, it was necessary to make this adjustment to partially compensate the cost increase.
The price revision will enable INSEE Cement to maintain our delivery excellence and technical support to our stakeholders nationwide. As the only fully integrated manufacturer of cement in Sri Lanka, we are committed to provide a continuous supply of cement to individual house builders and to all major infrastructure development projects that are in progress and in the pipeline.

Islanders rugby flagship knock-off round
The warm earthy colours of March add much to our island existence and herald the end of our club season and the start of a brand new school competition that promises to redefine the game as we know it.
Rugby in Sri is second to none...it shines bright all year round ...with age group formats that colour players from U10 up...and the apex u20 Singer schools rugby that is our beacon for fans from all corners of this incredible island.
The force is within ...as our Royal v Kingswood opener clearly defined by a full house and max inspiration for the young warriors in the middle....
The defending champions clearly better prepared and match ready...much different to a rusty Kingswood squad...short of finish and a long arduous lung buster season unfolding as we speak.
Each stable has left no stone unturned ....investing heavily on every front ....and pressure on the whole school family to deliver ...its beyond logic and way beyond convention that makes the history, more than fascinating.
Much will be writ about the planning ...or then again its simply a matter of unadulterated pride for each stable to muscle up and step right.
Royal and Trinity the hallowed sanctum of elaborate strategy and international budgets to match ......not surprisingly the oldest schools rugby fixture in the world in very good hands and supported all the way by our global multinational Singer plc.
The Bradby Shield is the epitome of all fixtures and fittingly a world feature of our island heritage...its beyond the greatest of examples and is hailed by all ...young and old, Sri islanders, the world over as the most historic annual confrontation to be found on this partially green planet.
The game is certainly flourishing and needs little introduction...if anything, with a global streaming audience of around 3million Sri islanders from home.....The two legs of the shield ...our version of fiesta ...rugby fiesta Sri style island magic.
International 7s opens our warriors up on the Asian stage ...then men looking to win silver ware and the women defending the cup title from 2017...such is our fiery assignment in Borneo...next week.
The men are wild carded for the World Series Hong Kong 7s later this busy March...an unforgiving journey across the China Sea!
Bigger still the Commonwealth Games in sunny Australia, where the Gold Coast host the best and brightest in glorious competition.
Our islanders meet the epitome of 7s and defending Olympic champion...Fiji in the opening match...a baptism of pure fire and less brimstone...hopefully
What a tantalising opportunity and experience for our lads and a chance to match up.....run against the skill our island brothers carry and stand up to their pressure in the middle.
My memories stark and too intimidating too mention in passing.....always a massive mind shift to play them in any corner of our rugby planet.
Expectations are rife and much anticipation about the quality of our islanders team for the battle listing from March to October.....let's wish the likes of Danushka Ranjan, Ratwatte, Jason and Ritchie fast recovery for the months ahead.
Likely that Muthu will skipper the side and good Auckland 7s experience to carry across Malaysia to Borneo.
Naturally our threat for domination....from Japan, Hong Kong Korea and China ....realities that Sri rugby would like to alter this 2018 season.
Preparation is everything and supreme reliability on fitness and maximum skills ...The only way to progress in Asia for starters!
As rugby fans we are certainly hopeful that this is the year for change ...so let's wish chief Asanga Seneviratne, CEO Priyantha Ekanayake and managing team at Sri HQ...the absolute best for all Asia rugby. Ahead ...its a grand task to push up both rankings ...Asian and World....and aim for our best effort this year.
It is imperative we make a mark and earn new respect in the region. Blessings to all who will be guiding and shaping our future ...its the challenge that counts and us islanders to the front.
Bula Bula the game and may we stride from strength to skill and pure pace beyond our wildest imagination.
The dream is reality when we score under the posts and defy all odds and form .....USA just did exactly that in Vegas last Sunday to beat Argentina in the World Series final...What a fantastic result and magical opportunities for our future in 7s.
Cheers indeed!

Lotus Tower to blossom soon
The foundation stone was laid on January 20, 2012 with an investment of $104.3 million to build an iconic tower in Sri Lanka. It was named the Lotus Tower project.
The Lotus Tower comes with unique features among them three museums which add more glamour to the tower and this project would be the icon of Colombo, said Prof. Nimal De Silva, Senior Engineer, Lotus Tower project.
The main purpose is transmission and the transmission will be run through this tower. The first and second floors of the tower, located at 215 meters and 219.8 meters, are to be used for TV and radio broadcasting. The ground first and second floors are for commercial purposes and it will be rented out soon. We are going to rent it out for a bigger amount, we intend to cover the cost of the construction within a certain period, he said.
On the Lotus Tower, three floors will be technical floors and that will be for technical people. At 234.2 metres (768 feet) on the fourth floor, there will be a restaurant with a revolving floor for fine dining to house 300 packs. At a height of 224.6 metres and 229.4 metres (737 and 752 feet) there will be two banquet halls on two floors. There will also be four chalets for foreign dignitaries, state guests and exclusive guests on the sixth floor, at 239 metres (784 feet). Above that there will be an observation deck where eight telescopes fixed to see around the city, Prof De Silva said.
Three museums will be introduced on the ground floor and the ground floor museum is going to be a natural history museum covering Geology, Zoology and Botany.
We have found fossils of Dinosaurs, Hippopotamus, Lion and Tiger from gem pits. Few weeks ago I found a jaw of an elephant that lived more than 10,000 years ago. All fossilized things are deposited; we thought that we should expose it to our people. All kinds of gems will be displayed at the museum. Secondly the cultural history, covering the traditional kitchen, pottery, dresses, festivals and many more things will be covered electronically, high technologically. The third museum would be the arts and crafts. The identity of the civilization comes with arts and crafts. We are going to setup a souvenir shop as well, he said.
The Prof said that they plan to give something that schoolchildren have never seen before and for them to get the knowledge of the history of Sri Lanka. The country has fascinating rock varieties and people are not aware of it, similarly there are many timber varieties here and people have never seen most of them. The intention was to show the Lankan people the real heritage and they can learn from it, he said.
We have installed very high speed lifts in this tower and the speed is seven meters per second. This will help people to go to functions within few minutes. It will enable to evacuate about 900 people in the middle and the top of the tower within half an hours time. Three elevators in the tower will be high speed elevators; two will travel at a medium speed of five meters per second, it will be mostly for service usage. It will be used for sending food and other items from the kitchen located in the basement to the top floors.
With the high speed elevators, it will be possible to reach the observation deck from the tower base in less than a minute. These lifts are fire proof, he said.
Chanaka Abeykoon, Administration Manager, Lotus Tower project said that there would be several VIP rooms in the sixth floor as well and a special area to view Colombo city and the pending Colombo Port City project.
However the major draw would be the revolving restaurant on the top floor which would do one round in 90 minutes. Once the project completed, and with the lightning tower in place, the tower will stand at a total of 356.3 metres, he said.
The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) serves as the local regulator of the project while the University of Moratuwa provides consultancy services for this project.

Media cautioned against inciting hate speech
The government yesterday requested everybody, including the media, to make sure they do not fan the flames of violence by inciting hate speech online on social media.
Government Information Director General Sudarshana Gunawardana said incitement of violence goes against the Constitution and the laws of the country.
All citizens, and especially media institutions, should ensure that they do not themselves incite violence or engage in hate speech in contravention of the laws of Sri Lanka, and that they do not publish such statements calculated to incite violence, the statement said.
It is disturbing to note that statements inciting violence, especially targeted against particular communities, have been published or circulated on certain media, especially social media.
It should be noted that such incitement to violence is contrary to the fundamental duties (recognized by Article 28 of the Constitution) of all citizens to uphold and defend the
Constitution and the law; to further the national interest and to foster national unity; to preserve and protect public property; and to respect the rights and freedoms of others.
To make statements intended to incite violence and or engage in hate speech amounts to criminal conduct according to the laws of Sri Lanka and according to Section 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Act.The relevant section states that No person shall propagate war or advocate national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence.
The Penal Code also criminalises the abetment of an offence (section 100), and recognizes that instigation of an offence would amount to abetment. Thus instigation of acts of violence such as
causing hurt and causing hurt with a dangerous weapon, etc would amount to the abetment of such offences.
While the Constitution recognises (subject to the imposition of lawful restrictions) the freedom of speech and expression including publication, these rights must be exercised in a responsible manner, with (among others) due regard for the rights and freedoms of others.The freedom of expression must also be exercised in a manner which does not amount to an incitement to
violence or hate speech.
Therefore all citizens, and especially media institutions, should ensure that they do not themselves incite violence or engage in hate speech in contravention of the laws of Sri Lanka, and that they do not publish such statements calculated to incite violence as aforesaid.

Mithun bags 6th RGTI title with Chennai Open crown
Sri Lankan Mithun Perera the exceptionally talented son of the legendary Nandasena Perera, captured his 6th major title on the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI), as he drove himself to the pole position from the 2nd round of the tournament, with a scintillating 7 under par, 'bogey free 63. Then, Mithun surged into a clear 3 stroke lead with another Bogey free 5 under par 3rd round. All this while, compatriot, room-mate and friend Thangaraja was in second place playing in the last flight with Mithun in the crucial final round. Thangaraja started round 4 in dream fashion firing 4 Birdies in the front nine to overhaul Mithun by one stroke but Mithun kept kept his cool as usual with a long birdie conversion on the 9th and a brilliant tap-in birdie on the 12th.
Thangaraja made an unusual poor shot on the 14th, which cost him a double bogey, the lead and the tournament, to finish in 4th place just 2 strokes behind Mithun.In the meantime, top PGTI Tour Pro Digvijay Singh shot a magnificent 8 under par 62 in the crucial final round and sat in the Club House on a 13 under total waiting for Mithun to falter.
The other power house and aenior atatesman on the Asian Tour Mukesh Kumar was quietly working his way to the top of the leader board with a closing round of 66, having won the Chennai Open in the last three years (2015, 2016, 2017) on his favourite hunting ground the Madras Gymkhana Club Golf Annexe, in Chennai to also tie with Digvijay Singh on 13 under par waiting for Mithun Perera to join them for a Sudden-death play-off.
The cool, bubbly, experienced Mithun Perera had other ideas, played conservatively and even though he dropped a stroke at the 17th, Par on the 72nd hole was enough for Mithun Perera to break his massive drought of victories on the Indian Tour. Mithun last won a major title 4 years ago, and at 31 years old, the Vine is sweeter now and Mithun Perera did Sri Lanka proud defeating a high profile field to capture his 6th PGTI title.
The feature of Mithun Pereras performance at the Chennai Open was his meticulous accuracy off the Tee and the number of regulations earning a
total of 17 Birdies with only 3 Bogeys for the 4 Rounds.Mithuns compatriots Thangaraja finished a very creditable 4th, Anura Rohana Ranked 3rd in the PGTI 2017, finished Joint 24th and Prabagaran secured Joint 32nd place out of 120 starters.
Mithun Pereras victory spiraled him to 2nd place in the PGTI 2018 Order of Merit behind Syed Saqib Ahmed who finished 19th on 2 under par. Thangaraja is Ranked 8th in the Order of Merit with some consistent performances missing out in a four-way sudden-death play-off in the previous PGTI Tour event, the Golconda Masters 2018, in Hyderabad.

The full statement
The National Christian Council of Sri Lanka is deeply distressed at the significant escalation in Inter-Religious tensions which have led to the loss of life and damage to property.
We appeal to all Peace-Loving Citizens in this country to take into consideration the heavy price we have paid for nearly three decades of war and violence and to work towards the peaceful resolution of the issues that are causing these acts of violence which are not in line with the righteous principles upon which this country is founded.
We appeal to all political parties and other formations to act with restraint and not to contribute further to the destabilisation of an already fragile Government, causing greater harm to the economy of the country and ultimately negatively affecting the poorer sections of our people. We appeal to all law enforcement authorities to act without partiality and to consider their paramount duty which is to ensure the security of every citizen of the country and to maintain law and order.
We appeal to all religious leaders to act together, sustained by our spiritual resources, to collectively work towards resolving all the fear, hatred and suspicion that arises at a time like this. The Council reiterates its ongoing commitment to work with any and all Religious groups as we seek to collectively restore peace and harmony for every citizen of this country.

Therefore, it is totally unacceptable and unpardonable that certain individuals are spreading false rumors that the NCPA is not operating properly, she said.

No Confidence Motion against Premier not constitutional
There is a lot of misconception regarding a No Confidence Motion (NCM) against a Prime Minister with even learned Rhodes Scholars being unable to comprehend that a NCM can only be brought against the Government and not the Prime Minister.
The Constitution is quite clear on this.
Article 48(2) provides for a No Confidence Motion against the Government and not the Prime Minister, or if Parliament rejects a Statement of Government Policy or the Appropriation Bill that the Cabinet of Ministers shall stand dissolved  See Article 48(2) of the Constitution given below:
Article 48 (2) - If Parliament rejects the Statement of Government Policy or the Appropriation Bill or passes a vote of no-confidence in the Government, the Cabinet of Ministers shall stand dissolved, and the President shall, unless he has in the exercise of his powers under Article 70, dissolved Parliament, appoint a Prime Minister, Ministers of the Cabinet of Ministers, Ministers who are not members of the Cabinet of Ministers and Deputy Ministers in terms of Articles 42, 43, 44 and 45.
Therefore it is very clear that, if a No Confidence Motion is passed as above, then the Cabinet would stand dissolved and the President would have to appoint a new set of persons and not any of those who had held the Office of Prime Minister, Cabinet Minister or State Minister or Deputy Minister.
This means that all those who hold such Offices will have to vacate such Office. In such circumstances would any such Minister or State Minister or Deputy Minister bring a No Confidence Motion against the Government, as they would all have to go out and cannot be re-appointed by the President as per the Constitution in terms of Article 48(2) above
Also how could a Member of the Government have no confidence with the Government In other words, would this not amount to no confidence of the Government of which he or she is an integral part, thereby admitting no confidence of such person in himself/herself
On the other hand, to dissolve Parliament before 4 years from August 2015 it would require the Parliament to pass a Resolution by a 2/3rd majority as per Article 70(B)(1).
Pertinently, as per Article 43(2) of the Constitution, on the advice of the Prime Minister the President shall appoint Ministers nominated by Prime Minister for the Ministries determined by the President in terms of the Article 43(1). Therefore if the Prime Minister nominates Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka as Minister of the subject of Law and Order, then President is bound by the Constitution to make such appointment in terms of Article 43(2).

It is illegitimate if SL Forces were involved against unarmed civilians or combatants
The Sri Lankan forces fought the war on behalf of the Government to eradicate the LTTE. They were carrying out the directions of the government. But beyond that, if the security forces were involved in acts against unarmed civilians or unarmed combatants, if they had disappeared after they had surrendered to the security forces, then that could not be put on the same basis that the SL forces were engaged legitimately in the conduct of the war as per the policy decisions of the State, said Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan.
Sampanthan said so, joining the Second Reading debate of the Bill for the protection against enforced disappearances in Parliament yesterday.
Referring to a comment by Foreign Minister Tilak Marapone that this law would only be applicable to the future and not to the past, Sampanthan said that he was unaware why that was so.
If the Security Forces went beyond legitimate means and took into custody civilians or unarmed combatants, they must be dealt with and such crimes should be prosecuted. If not, it would imply be that such crimes were being sanctioned by the State. I dont think that is acceptable.
He accepted that this law fills a vacuum that existed in our legal system for a long time, but the government must ensure that the law is enacted in such a way that was fair to all.
Persons suddenly disappearing in this country had existed for a long time. During the JVP insurrection during the 70s and 80s, several tens of thousands of youth disappeared. As a matter of fact, Mahinda Rajapaksa who was an Opposition Member of Parliamentat that time, on behalf of those people, even travelled to Geneva to the UN with documents to explain what was happening to the International Community in regard to people of this country. This was a matter that had been going on for a very long time and having had a war in this country for several decades, which ended in 2009, both during and after the war came to an end, he said, adding that there had been a wide spread complaint by the people of this country, particularly from the North and East, that a large number of Tamil people had disappeared.
Over the past several years, the next of kin of the disappeared have been demonstrating demanding that they be made aware of what happened to their next of kin, many of them who had surrendered to the Police or the Army. I think it was a very legitimate demand which must be addressed, while the Sri Lankan Government was moving to enact a law to bring into operation the international convention, pertaining to enforced disappearances prescribing the several offences that could or have been committed under that law, noted Sampanthan.
He pointed out that there seemed to be an impression sought to be created by some people in the country that the International Community was interfering somewhat unnecessarily in the affairs of this country and that it was not acceptable. Such action on the part of the International Community impinges on the sovereignty of this country. We all wish for the sovereignty of our country be protected, while there was no question about that. But, if you talk in terms of sovereignty, it does not mean that one could do whatever one likes by violating all international conventions, treaties, violate commitments made to the International Community and say that we are sovereign and we could do what we wished, while no one else could talk about what we do. But that is not acceptable and not in keeping with either domestic or international law and is something outrageous.
In addition, he said that it made out to look like the International Community was against the Armed Forces and is supportive of the LTTE. But nothing could be further than the truth as we all know that the LTTE was engaged in a war, good or bad or both good and bad they fought the war for over 30 years. They gave the State a bit of a run, there was no question about that, but eventually, they were defeated.
However, what must be remembered is that the International Communities, particularly India, completely backed the Sri Lankan Government with regard to the conduct of the war against the LTTE. The LTTE was banned in all those countries and their efforts to muster support for the war in that country in various ways, was impeded, hindered and prevented. Many countries provided intelligence support, in particular with regard to the movement of arms by the LTTE. Countries such as India, completely helped Sri Lanka completely eradicate the LTTE. The government made it out that the LTTE was a hindrance to political resolutions.
Those countries were of the belief that Sri Lanka would keep to its commitment.
However, the fact of the matter was that up to date, nine years have lapsed since the end of the war and even after 2  years since the new Government came into power, although we have seen some progress, we have not yet been able to achieve a political resolution to the conflict despite the commitment made to the International Community, he said. Sampanthan noted that the country was able to win the war primarily because of the support received by the International Community.
Yet, the misconception that the International Community was seeking to punish Sri Lanka for defeating the LTTE, must be gotten rid of. If not, he pointed out that it would not be helpful in the movement in the right direction towards bringing about a political resolution of the conflict.
Therefore, he called on the government to rethink this decision to make this law only applicable for the future and not for past actions.
To find solution for volatile situation in country: Dinesh wants meeting convened of Party heads
Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena rising to a point of order in Parliament yesterday, request Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to convene a meeting of all political party heads and seek a mechanism to control the volatile situation in the country.
He said the situation in the country was very serious and a State of Emergency had been declared. Normally, civil officers could not control the situation.
That was the reason the President had declared a State of Emergency.
Hence, as public representatives, we urge the Speaker to mediate in calling for a meeting with all party leaders and discuss measures needed to bring this situation under control. Sharing the views expressed by MP Gunawardena, MP Wimal Weerawansa said there was curfew being imposed in Kandy at present. Both the Sinhalese and Muslims in the Kandy district, currently live in fear. Even Government Ministers blame themselves and the Police. But the Government is allowing this situation to prolong and simply watching without taking action to stop it.
This was similar to a national tragedy, while not allowing this to ignite and spread. The news we hear today was not good news. Hence, if there is a semblance of a government left, then please stop this destruction.
If you are unable to do it, then kindly hand it over to someone who could do the job and stop the spread of violence.
He accused the government of allowing the people to take the law into their own hands and take up swords and weapons and attack each other, while the government simply watched on with folded arms. This is not a private issue, but it is our society that was being destroyed.
He said having a whole lot of ministers, there wasnt a single responsible minister in Parliament to take responsibility, he said.
In response, the Chief Organiser of the UNP, Minister Gayantha Karunatillake, said the Cabinet had discussed the countrys situation on Tuesday morning, while summoning the Security Forces heads and discussing with them too, the current situation.
He noted that the government would not hesitate to implement the law.
Karunatillake said relevant ministers and security forces and Police responsible officers had also been present at the Cabinet briefing held yesterday, to notify the country of the current situation in the country and measures taken to bring the volatile situation under control.
He noted that as a government, every effort had been taken to prevent the situation from escalating out of control.
Party with third largest number of members entitled for Opp. Leader post
Parliament yesterday, turned down a request by the Joint Opposition to include in the Standing Orders of Parliament that the person who holds the post of Leader of the Opposition, must command the majority support of Opposition benches.
When Parliament took up the committee stage of the revisions to the Standing Orders, JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena moved an amendment seeking to apply the principles of selecting the Prime Minister to the Opposition Leader as well.
This is not a matter of any individual, but a matter that affects all future Parliaments as well.
The Opposition Leader has huge responsibilities and he is an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council, which is the apex body handling important appointments. The Speaker must accept the person who wins the majority support in the Opposition as the Opposition Leader, he said.
Standing Orders Committee member and State Minister Ajith P Perera, however did not accommodate JOs proposal maintaining that the proposed revisions to the Standing Orders were drafted after a careful study of traditions in other countries too.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya too endorsed the same position.
Intervening at this point, NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa argued that the current Opposition Leader has no majority support and the peoples mandate had been distorted in Parliament.
TNA MP M A Sumanthiran replying to this concern said, This Parliament has only six recognized political parties, while two of those parties are in the Government. Therefore, the party that has the third largest number is entitled to the post of Opposition Leader. 
OMP meets CC headed by Speaker to discuss future action
The newly appointed members of the Office of Missing Persons (OMP), met with the Constitutional Council (CC) headed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday, subsequent to their appointments and discussed their future course of action.
During the meeting, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya assured the members of the Office of the Missing Persons and those of the Constitutional Council, that he would instruct the Ministry of Public Administration and the Treasury to provide necessary funds and infrastructure facilities for the setting up of offices for the OMP.
The Speaker gave this assurance when he met with the members of the OMP and CC at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday.
The Speaker said during the meeting that the OMPs primary task was to uncover the truth with regard to missing persons and notify their families of the results of the findings.
Among those present at the meeting representing the CC, were Leader of the Opposition R. Sampanthan, MP WDJ Seneviratne, Dr AT Ariyaratne, Shibly Aziz PC and Dr Radhika Coomaraswamy and from the OMP, its Chairman Saliya KM Pieris PC, Dr Sriyani Nimalka Fernando, Mirak Raheem, Kanapathipillai Venthan, Maj. Gen. Mohanti Anotenette Maltidevi Pieris, Punyamoorthy Jeyatheepa, SK Liyanage, Chandima Wickramasinghe (Senior Assistant Secretary, Presidential Secretariat), Ibrahim Ansar (UN International Affairs Coordinating Unit), Tharaka Hettiarachchi (UN International Affairs Coordinating Unit), V Sivagnanasothy (Secretary to the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation), J J Ratnasiri (Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration and Management), Nalani Amaratunga (Director, Department of National Budget), H G Sumansinghe (Director General, Department of Management Services, Ministry of Finance) and A Vaidehi (Director, Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation).
House approves revised set of Standing Orders, Code of Conduct for MPs
Parliament unanimously approved the revised set of Standing Orders of Parliament and the Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament, yesterday.
The final drafts of the new Standing Orders and Code of Conduct for MPs were tabled in Parliament by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in November last year, after months of deliberation and a days debate on them were taken up on February 19.
Opposition members Dinesh Gunawardena, M A Sumanthiran and Tharaka Balasuriya, actively contributed to the last minute amendments to them at the Committee stage and the Government accommodated those proposals as much as possible.
The set of Standing Orders previously in use was formulated in 1979 and was last revised on February 6, 1993. The modified version has been made with the extensive consultation of all MPs and after taking into consideration the changes to Parliamentary traditions over time.
Change in the sitting time of Parliament, the role of the newly introduced sectoral oversight committees and the recently adopted electronic voting system have been included into the revised Standing Orders.Speaker Jayasuriya said the Code of Conduct for MPs and revised SO, would help uplift the standards of the Sri Lanka Parliament and pave the way for a better political culture. State Minister Ajith P Perera reminded that introducing a Code of Conduct for MPs was a pre-election pledge of the Government.
One specific clause in EDB: No person could be held in detention secretly:Jayampathy
One of the specific clauses in the Enforced Disappearance Bill(EDB) is that no one could be held in detention secretly. This cannot be included in the Penal Code, said UNP-MP Jayampathy Wickramaratne in Parliament yesterday.
He said the OMP Bill was one that had been spoken about, criticised and misconstrued more than any other Bill. Even those with profound legal knowledge had misconstrued the OMP Bill. One of the common misinterpretations was that the law applies to the past as well.
The 13th Paragraph of our Constitution under fundamental rights, clearly states that a criminal law brought in applies only to the future, he said, adding that therefore, it was not necessary to mention it specifically as the Constitution was above all.
However, if we have signed any convention that specifically applies to the past, then, there was provision to include a clause specifying it. Then it needs to be specifically mentioned.
However, this act was taken before the Supreme Court and had there been any room to also include past deeds, then this act would not have been passed.
Then Supreme Court would have determined that a referendum was required. However, that was not required as there was no retrospective clause.
Hence, there is no need to have any doubt about it, he said.
Wickramaratne noted that Sri Lanka is a duellist country and just because we sign an international convention, it does not become law in this country. However, in countries such as Netherlands, acceding to an international convention automatically becomes law in that country. But, we are not like that. However, it is ironic that the majority of those who misinterpreted the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from the Enforced Disappearance Bill, were those who held higher positions of legal educators.
Wickramaratne, further focussing on the current situation in the country, charged that hailing from Kandy, he was receiving messages frequently and in many instances, the Police were inactive and looking on without taking action
. Their excuse was that they did not receive orders. There is no way that the Police could shoot into the air and control such a situation. Emergency is not imposed to simply do nothing. Preventive detention could be used to bring the situation under control.
There is no point in imposing curfew just at night, it should be used during the day too, to prevent the situation from spreading to other areas.
Parliament passes two Bills with amendments
Parliament yesterday passed the Safeguard Measures Bill and the Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties Bill with Amendments.
The Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties Bill aims to protect local industries and manufacturers from the goods imported to Sri Lanka without control. The Safeguard Measures Bill provides for the conduct of investigations and the application of safeguard measures on products imported into Sri Lanka.
Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties Bill imposes Anti-Dumping Taxes against the introduction of imported goods to the local market at a lower price than their actual value and Countervailing Taxes against the entry into the local market of imported goods at unusually low prices due to the various concessions granted by foreign governments.
The amendments to the two Bills were moved by Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama.

Political divisions contributing to unrest - Prelate
Political divisions is the major contributory factors towards the present unrest. No one can prevent the country from falling into an abyss if national unity is disrupted, Most Ven. Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter said.
The Mahanayake Thera expressed these sentiments when JVP leader and Opposition Chief Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake called on him at his temple in Kandy and received his blessings yesterday morning.
The Mahanayake Thera said that disruption of national unity would adversely affect the countrys future.
He added that each and every community was duty bound to safeguard national unity.
The JVP leader who later called on the Most.Ven.Dimbulkumbure Wimaldhamma Anunayake Thera and received his blessings said clashes could be avoided if all Buddhists acted according to Buddhas dictum, Nahee Veerena Veherani (Hatred ceases not by hatred but by love).
He emphasised that religious leaders and prelates had a great role to play to subdue the current tension in the country.

Proper mechanism to strengthen ethnic harmony needed- Patali
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said there should be a proper mechanism to strengthen ethnic harmony and to settle clashes between ethnic groups at the very beginning promptly.
The Minister added that it is important to establish a quick response unit, which operated during the terror period to settle communal unrest with immediate effect without letting minor issues develop as a national issue.
The Minister said so while addressing a media conference at the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) Headquarters in Battaramulla yesterday.
Minister Ranawaka urged the government to exercise the law and order properly and impartially without considering the positions. Similarly, he urged the public to act responsibly.
He suggested that the government hold an all communal discussion to strengthen communal harmony and to let people as brothers and sisters of one family.
The Minister said that there are a few miscreants, which use such incidents for gain narrow political mileage.
These scavengers are the scum of the earth whose hands are stained in blood who try to utilise communal clashes for their petty political gains, Minister Ranawaka added.
Skills Development and Vocational Training State Minister Karunaratne Paranawitharana said that certain people are trying to convert the Kandy issue into a communal dispute. But, people of the country should be wise enough to act peacefully and in a responsible manner.
According to the Deputy Minister, the Kandy incident is only an isolated one and therefore it is clear that it cannot be considered as a communal dispute.

The Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed to a $500m (359.7m) settlement with New York State over the mis-selling of financial products in the lead up to the 2008 global financial crisis.
RBS is the sixth bank to settle with the state over similar claims, linked to risky mortgages.
The agreement will see the bank pay $400m in relief to homeowners, as well as $100m to the state.
RBS still faces a potentially massive fine from the US Department of Justice.
The bank said last month that it had put aside 3.2bn ($4.4bn) to cover upcoming settlements with the US and others.The sale of the risky mortgage-backed securities had contributed to a housing price crash during the financial crisis, the New York attorney generals office said.
RBS is majority owned by the UK government. It has been trying to return to financial health since the financial crisis, when it was bailed out for tens of billions of pounds.
The bank said last month that it had returned to profit for the first time in ten years.
While the financial crisis may be behind us, New Yorkers are still feeling the effects of the housing crash, said state attorney-general Eric Schneiderman.
Todays settlement is another important step in our comprehensive effort to help New Yorkers rebuild their lives and communities.
Royal Bank of Scotland has returned to profit for the first time in a decade as it continues its recovery.
Chief executive Ross McEwan told the BBC it was a really symbolic moment.
The bank, which is majority-owned by the taxpayer, made an annual profit of 752m compared with a 6.95bn loss the year before.

Religious leaders play pivotal role in maintaining peace and harmony- President
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday requested religious leaders of all faiths to play a pivotal role in maintaining peace and harmony among all communities in areas affected by the recent unrest.
The President had made this request during a special meeting with religious and political leaders, government officials and security authorities at Presidents House in Kandy yesterday.
The President during the meeting had requested religious leaders of all faiths to help maintain peace in addition to efforts undertaken by security authorities to maintain law and order.
President Sirisena drew the attention of those present to the predominant role religious leaders could play in alleviating misunderstandings among various groups and establishing peace, according to a media communiqu issued by the Presidents media unit.
Religious leaders meanwhile had pointed out that certain media including social media had contributed in aggravating the unrest by carrying false and fabricated news and blowing out of proportion some minor incidents.
The President in response emphasised on the importance of making the public aware about the truth and correct details.
He advised state officials present to take necessary steps to make people aware about the true situation through religious leaders using the media.
President Sirisena stressed on the importance of taking all steps necessary by religious leaders to consolidate peace and harmony among all ethnic groups without any racial or religious differences and create an environment which ensures a non-recurrence of any violent incidents in future. He instructed the Inspector General of Police and Security forces Commanders to take all necessary measures to further strengthen security for the people in the affected areas and help establish peace.
President Sirisena also instructed security officials to apprehend those responsible for violent acts and take necessary action against them in accordance with the law, irrespective of status or differences.

Retro reflective signboards to reduce railway accidents
Retro reflective signboards will be installed at unprotected level crossings across the country as a solution to the continuous fatal accidents on railway level crossings and resultant multiple deaths island wide.
National Council for Road Safety Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said retro reflective signboards will be installed initially prioritizing the frequency of accidents and unsafe locations. The rest of the boards will be installed in the future.
The first retro reflective signboard will be installed at the unprotected level crossing located in Nawinna on March 12.

Roads to development - unveiled by her strength
Empowerment exists when women can equitably participate in, contribute to, and benefit from economic opportunities as workers, consumers, entrepreneurs, and investors, and, equality exists when all women and girls have the same opportunities as men and boys for education, economic participation, decision-making, and freedom from violence.
While International Womens Day is now largely aimed at inspiring women across the world and celebrating their achievements, its roots are in movements campaigning for better pay and voting rights. International Womens Day (IWD) is celebrated on March 8 every year. It commemorates the movement for womens rights.
While the first observance of a Womens Day was held on February 28, 1909 in New York, March 8 was suggested by the 1910 International Womans Conference to become an International Womans Day. After women gained suffrage in Soviet Russia in 1917, March 8 became a national holiday there. The day was then predominantly celebrated by the socialist movement and communist countries until it was adopted in 1975 by the United Nations.
female representation
Sri Lanka is a country, which granted the franchise to women even before many developed Western countries. As a result of this background, Sri Lanka was able to produce the worlds first woman Prime Minister as well as the first Executive President.
The Government has taken a policy decision to increase the female representation in all political decision-making bodies. As the first step, the Government in March last year amended the Local Authorities Election Act to include 25 percent quota for women at the Local Government elections.
An Elections Department official said that female representation in Provincial Councils is about 4 percent as of now.
Although Sri Lanka produced first prime minister of the world, Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1960 and her daughter Chandrika Bandaranaike became prime minister first and later the executive president, the female representation in Parliament is as low as 5 percent.
It is all the more unfortunate when considering that this is lower than many other South Asian countries. Although Sri Lanka is high in many human development indices, when it comes to women representation in parliament, it is mere 5% , which is comparatively a lot less than Nepal (33.2%), Bangladesh (19.7%) and India (10.9%).
Sri Lankan women are well aware of politics. It is not a question of the lack of political awareness and empowerment among women for such low representation, but they are extremely reluctant to enter the political arena as they are hampered by the social norms. The general notion among the public is that the political campaigns are run mostly by males. Campaigns are known for rowdy acts, and distribution of liquor and it is no place for even a decent male, not to talk about decent womenfolk.
When it comes to education, we see girls are taking top positions in almost all examinations from Grade 5 Scholarship Examination to General Examinations on ordinary level and advanced level. For the last few decades female graduates at universities outnumber the males. Furthermore, the right to education has paved the way for women in our country to secure highest positions in the administrative system of the country. Hence nobody could say women do not have the required competency and knowledge to contribute to national policy formulation effectively.
New political culture
As President Maithripala Sirisena often says, what is essential is to nominate clean and pure candidates so that the general image of politician could undergo a transformation and new political culture could be established. In such a scenario one can expect qualified women entering the field of politics in sufficient numbers.
Another objective of the present government is to develop female entrepreneurship and to increase the female participation in industries and production. Thus, special loan schemes and entrepreneur training programmes have been activated in government and non- governmental level.
The final objective behind all these programmes is to ensure the female of the country amounting half the entire population to be an equal partner of a nation which possesses a high social development.
As the root cause to most issues, education is a facility which empowers all the social scenarios into better live been. In Sri Lanka education is compulsory up to a certain age. This has identified as a great achievement of our country among all the de facto.
Girls education is a strategic development priority. Better educated women tend to be healthier, participate more in the formal labor market, earn higher incomes, have fewer children, marry at a later age, and enable better health care and education for their children, should they choose to become mothers. All these factors combined can help lift households, communities, and nations out of poverty.
Girls education goes beyond getting girls into school. It is also about ensuring that girls learn and feel safe while in school; complete all levels of education with the skills to effectively compete in the labour market; learn the socio-emotional and life skills necessary to navigate and adapt to a changing world; make decisions about their own lives; and contribute to their communities and the world.
All the beliefs of ours lie upon on this International Womens day celebration that these celebrations would usher an important debate on these progressive social development objectives.

SANASA group holds Lets Be the Change  to commemorates International Womens Day
In conjunction with the International Women's Day, SANASA Group held a special program under the theme Lets be the Change at the Navarangahala, Royal College recently. Marking the beginning of a series of women-centered programs, plans are underway to implement a comprehensive islandwide awareness campaign encompassing the key drivers including women, children, family and the environment.
Chairperson of SDB bank Samadanie Kiriwandeniya expressed her views on the tremendous contribution made by SANASA Movement, an organization strongly backed by a majority of women, towards uplifting the living standards of the local women.
This year's commemoration of Women's Day has become quite special as women have earned a higher representation in local government areas. As SANASA Movement, we intend to collaborate with the new local government agents and implement a broad scale plan at regional level for the benefit of our women. This year's theme for Women's Day is Lets be the Change'.
SANASA Movement has made a tremendous contribution towards empowering women. Our movement is backed by 54% of women. For 40 long years, we have been able to provide a conducive environment to build a strong women's force as a result of inculcating entrepreneurship and income generating means among rural communities.
At this juncture, we believe women should act more intelligently and cautiously. Its of utmost importance that a woman should identify the needs of her own as well as of her family. Gaining sufficient knowledge and discipline to meet essential needs, without falling into market gimmicks is a quintessential trait for a woman. In a matriarchal society, a family revolves around the mother of the household. Hence, its pivotal for a mother to properly manage the household tasks.
We feel that, when striving to improve our assets, we need to act based on a new vision. One of the major issues of the society is having a higher Dependent Population in comparison to Independent Population. Instead of simply saving, this calls for a more pragmatic approach in improving assets. Therefore, its important to contemplate on utilizing the hard earned money for a successful investment. For example, if one wishes to target a sum of Rs. 10 million in Ten years, then its imperative to decide on a proper investment plan to follow in order to achieve the target.
SANASA Movement has given a prominent place for women, and also implements various programs including Uththamavi in order to appreciate their true values. Since ancient times, Sri Lankan women have been known to be courageous and wise.

FR petitions on PC elections:
SC refuses to grant leave to proceed
The Supreme Court yesterday refused to grant leave to proceed with seven Fundamental Rights petitions filed by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris and six others challenging the decision of the Election Commission to indefinitely postpone conducting elections at Provincial Councils which already stand dissolved.
However, a majority of a divided three-judge-Supreme Court bench refused to grant leave to proceed with the petitions citing that there is no legal basis to proceed with the petitions.
The Supreme Court bench comprised of Chief Justice Priyasad Dep, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Nalin Perera.
In his petition, Prof. G.L. Peiris was seeking an order to take steps to conduct elections for the Sabaragamuwa, North Central and Eastern Provincial Councils.
Professor G.L. Pieris, in his petition, challenges the decision of the Election Commission to indefinitely postpone conducting elections.
He cited Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya, its members, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and the Attorney General as respondents.
He stated that indefinitely postponing taking steps in accordance with the Constitution and the law to conduct elections in several Provincial Councils which already stand dissolved by operation of Article 154E of the Constitution, constitutes an infringement of the Fundamental Rights of the petitioner and of the people, guaranteed by Articles 10, 12 (1) and 14(1) (a) of the Constitution.
He stated that the constituted Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council, duly elected by the people in 2012, stood dissolved on 27-09-2017 and the North Central as well as Eastern Provincial Councils too stood dissolved on 01-10-2017.

School cricket season reaches its climax with Royal-Thomian
The 2017/18 inter-school cricket season will reach its peak this weekend with the oldest uninterrupted inter-school match in world history. This seasons school cricket will reach its climax with the 139th Battle of the Blues cricket encounter between Royal and S. Thamas which begins at SSC grounds tomorrow (Friday).
Probably, this will be the first time since 1985 that the Battle of the Blues encounter starts on a Friday. The encounter which customary starts on Thursday of the second week in the month of March since it became a three-day affair from the centenary encounter in 1979, has been put off by a day due to the state funeral of Most Venerable Daranagama Kusaladhamma thera, Chief incumbent of Sri Sambodhi Viharaya, Colombo and founder of The Buddhist television and radio channel, scheduled to be held on Thursday at the Independence Square. Incidentally, the most venerable thero is a distinguished old boy of Royal College.
The Royal-Thomain encounter, the last of the four main big matches, in Colombo will be followed by a few more big matches in the suburbs and outstations scheduled to be played before the end of this month.
Interestingly, history was created on Tuesday with Sri Lankas first-ever girls school cricket big match in Nuwara Eliya - between Gamini National School and Our Ladies Upper School at the Race Course grounds. It is heartening to see the progress of girls schools cricket in Sri Lanka under the directions of Chairperson of SLCs w0mens cricket Apsari Sinhabahu Tillakaratne, wife of former Sri Lanka Test captain Hashan Tillakaratne.
Sri Lankas inter-school cricket structure is considered one of the best, if not the best and well-organised one in the world. Many school cricket officials and youth coaches world over have hailed Sri Lankas well-knit school cricket structure which has five different age groups under three divisions in each age category. Over the years, it has been the feeder pool to the national team. There has not been an organized inter-school cricket tournament for Under-19 until 90s, despite the island-wide participation. All what they had until then were friendly matches, some over a century old.
There was hardly any recognition for the milestone achievements of schoolboy cricketers. Lack of an organized inter-school tournament deprived young schoolboys of their due recognition. Even the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) first had only a limited over knock out tournament at Under-19 level, on completion of the first XI matches and traditional big matches, that too from late 80s.
Sri Lankas flagship English newspaper - the Sunday Observer, and its publisher Lake House understood the need to recognize the talents of the countrys schoolboy cricketers and inspiring them to continue their careers at club level.
It is with that vision in mind that the Sunday Observer commenced the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest way back in 1978/79. That proved to be a resounding success and the event ultimately turned out to be the most looked forward to event in school cricket calendar. Ever since the then Royal captain Ranjan Madugalle was adjudged the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 1979, Sri Lankas first ever inter-school cricket awards show has produced many legendary cricketers who have played for Sri Lanka with distinction.
Playing its true corporate social responsibility role as the countrys premier English newspaper - the Sunday Observer gave birth to the countrys first-ever Schools Cricket Awards ceremony four decades ago at Navarangahala, Colombo 7 in 1979. It was a fitting tribute to Madugalle who led the Reid Avenue boys in the centenary Battle of the Blues cricket encounter against S. Thomas in the same year. Crowning Madugalle as the first-ever Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year was a memorable and a great beginning not only to the prestigious contest but also for the first-ever recipient of the title who later went on to play for Sri Lanka and now the Chief Match Referee of the International Cricket Council.
During the four decades of its cherished history, the Mega Show has produced some of the legendary cricketers that Sri Lanka has ever produced, including the countrys 1996 World Cup-winning captain turned minister Arjuna Ranatunga, worlds highest wicket-taker in Test cricket Muttiah Muralitharan and the most valuable player of the 1996 World Cup tournament in which Sri Lanka emerged champions, Sanath Jayasuriya.
Besides these four recipients, the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest has baptized some of the most outstanding players to the big league - 1996 World Cup star Asanka Gurusinha, former captains Roshan Mahanama and Marvan Atapattu to name a few.
Winning the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title has been the dream of every schoolboy cricketer as they generally believe that the prestigious title would take them closer to wear Sri Lanka cap. Most past winners of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the tile had made their Sri Lanka debut in next to no time, some of them just months after winning the Crown. There are three past Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year main award winners in the current Sri Lanka team - Dinesh Chandimal (2009), Niroshan Dickwella (2012) and Kusal Mendis (2013). The trio stepped into the Sri Lanka team just months after their crowning glory to become vitalingredients to the national team.
Sri Lanka Test captain Chandimal is the most experienced of the three, winning the prestigious Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 2009 when he was representing Ananda College, Colombo. Former Trinity skipper, Dickwella won the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 2012.
Kusal Mendis, who led Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa with distinction, was adjudged Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 2013.
Former Nalanda captain and ex-ICC Match Referee Roshan Mahanama was the first to win the prestigious Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year on successive years - in 1983 and 1984.
A household name in school cricket during early 80s he first won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 1983 with a rich harvest with the willow.
He continued to let his willow to do the talking in the following year too and his superb form won him the title for the second successive year in 1984.
Although former Ananda captain Arjuna Ranatunga too had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title twice prior to Mahanama, Ranatunga had not won the crown on successive years. Ranatunga first won the coveted title in 1980 after Ranjan Madugalle but failed to repeat the following year, finishing runner up to Rohan Buultjens of St. Peters. However, in his final inter-school first XI season for Ananda, Ranatunga was crowned Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year once again in 1982.
Following Ranatunga and Mahanama to join the select band of schoolboy cricketers to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title twice each were Thilan Samaraweera (1994 and 1995), Lahiru Peiris (2004 and 2005), Bhanuka Rajapaksa (2010 and 2011) and Charith Asalanka (2015 and 2016).
Finding huge funding that is needed to host a great show of this magnitude is no easy task. Although the cost to host the show in the first couple of decades was marginally less, it was a commendable contribution by Haliborange which sponsored the inaugural show and the Bata Shoe Company which followed.
But the entry of Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel as the sponsor added value to the Mega Show, improving the standard of the event to solid trophies and larger cash awards. The Observer-Mobitel partnership which celebrates its 11th successive year, has not only recognizes the achievements of schoolboy cricketers but also to reward their coaches and master-in-charges, who make a silent role in molding the next generation of champion cricketers.
SLT Mobitel, the national mobile service provider, continues to provide that smart connection to the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Contest. Under the directions of the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Telecom and SLT Mobitel P.G. Kumarasingha, the Chief Executive Officer of the SLT Mobitels Nalin Perera has made a great contribution towards the success of the event during the past decade.
The Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year continues to enjoy the longstanding association of the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) and the Sri Lanka Cricket Umpires and Scorers Association under the blessings of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), headed by Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala.

Situation in Kandy under control
The government reiterated yesterday that the instability and unrest in Kandy caused by a wave of communal clashes over the last three days have diminished due to a strong presence of the Security Forces, a curfew which has been re-instated for the next 24 hours and emergency rule.
Speaking to the media in a hurried press conference, Secretary to the Ministry of Defence Kapila Waidyaratne told the press that the situation had normalised but the government was not taking its chances.
We have brought into force an emergency rule which unlike the previous times has new inclusions which we believe will assist the security forces and police to arrest the situation, he said. Meanwhile, Secretary to the President Austin Fernando who chaired the press briefing said that the government was acting on the findings of investigations and intelligence to ensure that the crisis does not spiral out of control. As part of these measures, the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission has requested all telecom operators to curtail the transmission of data, limiting connectivity on social media platforms such as Facebook, Whatsapp to name a few.
We have come across evidence of fake news, images that criminalize innocent individuals and content that harm the effort the government is making to ensure that these communities peacefully coexist. It is with this rationale and evidence that the operators will be limiting the transmission of data temporarily, he said.
The public can see for themselves, the type of content that is widely shared and the effect it has on the current situation.
He added that the unrest had become more precarious over the last three days due to widespread fake news that has been circulated on social media platforms, prompting fear mongering and further instability which could potentially spread to other parts of the country. Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Ravindra Chandrasiri Wijegunaratne said that the situation was limited to Kandy and that the Security Forces have been adequately equipped by law to take necessary action against unruly elements. While refraining from commenting on the number of security personnel who are deployed in various places, he added that every effort is taken to ensure the safety and security of all communities.

Stern action against saboteurs - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe delivering a special statement on the situation in Kandy yesterday said the Security Forces Chiefs and the Police have been instructed to take prompt action against acts of sabotage and be prepared to control any kind of unrest.
He said that Security Forces Commander in the Central Province, Major General Rukman Dias has been appointed to coordinate security related activities between the Police and the Security Forces.
Premier Wickremesinghe further said that the Tri Forces, the Special Task Force have been deployed in the Kandy district in addition to the Police in order to ensure that the normal life of the community is maintained without any hindrance and that law and order is maintained.
He also said that additional Security Forces personnel have been dispatched to the area. While noting that rumours were being spread that religious leaders have been harmed, the Premier said that there was no truth to such reports.
Giving details about some violent acts which took place yesterday, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said several shops in the Katugastota area had been set on fire.
He said that a hand grenade in the possession of a person who was among a group who had been acting violently had exploded. He said these incidents were being investigated by the Police.
In the other areas of the Kandy district, law and order and peace prevailed, the Premier explained.
The Prime Minister went on to say that after considering the prevailing situation,a curfew had been imposed in the Kandy district under Emergency regulations since 4.00 pm yesterday.

Swift action to contain racially motivated attacks
The government came in full force yesterday at the weekly cabinet meeting to condemn the racially motivated attacks that have taken place in Kandy since Sunday (4) night.
Two cabinet meetings were held yesterday to discuss the ongoing situation with the last one called at 7pm on Tuesday night. Co-cabinet spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne addressing the media at the Government Information Department said separate meetings with the National Security Council and heads of government were held thereafter to decide on what needs to be done to control the situation. Minister Senaratne confirmed that they had taken the decision to control and monitor social media sites to contain the spread of rumours and inflammatory messages which have resulted in ethnic tensions being further heightened in the country.
Internet access to those in the Kandy district was thus cut off with social media platforms like Facebook,Viber and Instagram being blocked islandwide. Internet speeds were also reduced across all platforms.
The government decided last night (6) to take strict action against all those who spread communal hatred and to investigate into who is behind this, Minister Senaratne said.
He said that thus far they have been able to discover that the incidents in Digana and Teldeniya were carefully planned and executed by persons with political backing.
The Minister declared that there were seven persons involved in the conspiracy so far; two recently appointed local government councillors, two Members of Parliament, a monk affiliated to their political party, a secretary of one of the MPs and one of their Party organisers.
The Minister alleged that the unrest may have been caused by a certain party wanting to distance the minorities from the government.
The government received most of the minority vote at the last election, when you look at the election results, those who say they have won, have not succeeded as much and our vote base has not reduced either. If they are to increase their vote base from 40 percent, they have to increase it by 11 percent. And the only way to do this is to have the minorities move away from the government.Certain MPs have stated in Parliament that even votes we couldnt get, we will get next time. So we will look into all this, he said.
In response to why the police were not more effective at the time of the unrest however, Minister Senaratne said that investigations have been launched into the conduct of the police at the time and that thus far it was revealed that the Kandy ASP was not present when things broke out and thus the junior officers had not been given any clear instructions to act.
The Minister who was supported by his cabinet colleagues, Co-cabinet spokesperson, Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister, Gayantha Karunathilake, Public Administration and Management, Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Deputy Minister of Finance and Mass Media, Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Highways and Higher Education Minister, Kabir Hashim and Special Assignments Minister, Dr.Sarath Amunugama.
Speaking on behalf of the SLFP, Minister Amunugama said all political parties in Parliament have with one voice rejected racism and extremism. We have all stated that this is something which should not be allowed and I thank them for that.
He stressed that as the government they would not be remiss in their responsibility to uphold the Constitution of the country which guarantees equal rights and freedoms for all ethnic groups in the country.
The Minister also stressed that the attacks were politically motivated and that people from outside the area have been brought to escalate the situation.
All evidence points to an organised and carefully implemented plan, said Amunugama.
This is not a conflict between groups within the village. People from outside were brought in vehicles, people spoke in inflammatory languages and caused conflict
Evidence is revealed, that this was organized and carefully implemented. The police have arrested certain individuals; some are attached to politics, some are former military men and some are active military personnel, he added.
UNP General Secretary, Minister Hashim speaking on behalf of the UNP said they strongly condemned these attacks and stated that as a multiracial party, they believed in protecting the rights of all citizens to live together equally as Sri Lankans.
The Buddhist monks and Muslim religious leaders had met and discussed the incident of the murder of the lorry driver and agreed to not have it get out of hand, but a group from outside had come and launched attacks, said Hashim.
He stressed that whilst a political group with certain agendas were trying to inflame the situation, the President and Prime Minister have taken a strong stand to enforce the law equally to all parties, regardless of their ethnic or religious backgrounds.
For all those who are encouraging attacks, do not think that there will not be any consequences. We all will suffer as a result of this, said Minister Amunugama.
Military in control in most areas - Chief of Defence Staff
Chief of Defence Staff, Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne commenting on the security situation at cabinet yesterday said the military was in control in most areas and that they were using minimum force to contain tensions,
These groups of attackers are not armed, they come with clubs and stones, most damage are done to property and apart from those who got caught in between, there have been no casualties.
He stressed that the military has taken extra precautions to ensure that there are no lives lost as those behind these attacks were expecting such a scenario.
We are very much aware that the people behind this want us to fire and kill people, he said.
Today we are alive because of the Muslim community, our intelligence was mainly run by the Muslims.The military is grateful to them.They sacrificed their lives and went with us on long range reconnaissance patrols, he added.
All these Sinhalese who are doing this damage to our Muslim brothers are traitors. This community was always with us and they protected us.In Kandy all walked freely without LTTE bombs because of the Muslims who were in the armed forces.That is why they were targeted by the LTTE
I am saddened as a professional military man by these incidents. Most who are doing this damage have never seen war, the Admiral said.
He however admitted that the forces could not cover the entire area and that minor incidents have been reported even during the police curfews.
People on motorbicycles throw stones at mosques or temples and run off. They are hard to catch, he said. Commenting on stones being thrown at a temple in Ambatenna, he said they were not sure whether it was done by Muslims or by Sinhalese themselves to make things worse.

S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia will hold a slight edge over Royal College and are confident of holding the upper hand and pressing for a win when they meet their traditional rivals in the 139th Battle of the Blues three-day cricket encounter which will take place at SSC grounds from tomorrow. This match is played for the prestigious D. S. Senanayake Memorial Shield.
The Mount Lavinia boys are famous for their fighting qualities and they last proved what the Thomian grit is all about at the centenary years encounter in 1979 when hero of the game Mahinda Halangoda (former SSC captain) with a spectacular unbeaten innings of 70 teamed up with fast bowler C.P. Richards 20 not out (playing only his second match for the season) figured in a match saving unbroken 91-run partnership for the ninth wicket to earn a honourable draw.
Recalling that innings Halangoda said: It was a team game, not only me and Richards who saved it that day but we all did it. We all had a role to play and we did it for our College and our alma mater.
Our College motto is Be Thou Forever and the determination and our preparation helped us. Even today I think its about the persons attitude, not giving up but to commit yourself and work towards your goals and think that nothing is impossible. The Thomians are not dead until they are buried.
The Thomians have been shaping well with six wins against Dharmapala College Pannipitiya, Zahira College Maradana, Maliyadeva College Kurunegala, Prince of Wales College Moratuwa, Nalanda College and Lumbini College and are unbeaten this season.
The Thomian team is a blend of experience and youth. They have the services of Kalana Perera, who has turned out to be a vital cog in the Sri Lanka youth team playing in the ICC Under 19 World Cup in New Zealand. In four matches this season, Kalana has taken 31 wickets with the best bowling of 7 for 37 against Zahira College.
Third year coloursman Dellon Peiris (son of rugby referee Dinka Peiris) is the captain of the side. Besides his useful contributions as a right hand middle order batsman by scoring over 450 runs this season. Dellon has shown great success as a left arm leg spinner as well. He has shown no mercy on batsmen with his deadly leg breaks, taking over 60 wickets. On four occasions, he has innings analysis of five wickets or more.
The highest run getter for the Mount Lavinia boys is right hander cum middle order batsman Maneesha Rupasinghe who has scored nearly 700 runs. Top order batsman right hander Manthila Wijeratne, has also shown great form scoring over 600 runs with some impressive knocks.
Wicket-keeper and left-hand top order batsman Sithara Hapuhinna, has aggregated nearly 600 runs with a top score of 63.
Among the others who are capable of keeping the scoreboard moving are right hander Kishan Munasinghe together with left hander Dulith Gunaratne both have scored over 400 runs each along with right hand batsman Shalin de Mel who has nearly 400 runs under his belt.
Sharing the new ball attack are left arm paceman Kalana Perera and right arm medium pacie Thevin Eriyahgama who has captured nearly 30 wickets.
But the deadliest weapons in the Thomian bowling armory will be the left arm leg breaks of Shannon Fernando, who has a total of nearly 70 wickets. He has produced a seasons best innings analysis of 7 for 66 against Wesley College.
Although S. Thomas will be over dependent on Shannon and Dellon there are a few others who could pose a serious threat to the Royal batting line up like left arm leg spinner Pavith Ratnayake who has 20 wickets to his credit.
D. S. Senanayake, who became the first Prime Minister of independent Ceylon, donned the Thomian cap in 1901 and 1902. Other notable S. Thomas players who have played in the Royal-Thomian cricket match are Dudley Senanayake, Vernon Prins, Michael Tissera, Anura Tennekoon, Buddy Reid, Mano Ponniah, Bradman Weerakoon, Duleep Mendis, Guy de Alwis, Mahinda Halangoda, Aruna Gunawardene, Saliya Ahangama, Kaushik Amalean, Kapila Wijegunawardene, Johanne Samarasekera, Nisal Fernando, Manoj Mendis, Jeevan Mendis, Kaushal Silva, S. Saravanamuttu, P. Saravanamuttu, M. Saravanamuttu, Mevan Pieris (Snr), Ranil Abeynaike, Shantha Kottegoda and Michael Jayasekera to name a few.
The first century in the series came in the 38th encounter in 1917, when Thomian batsman B.T Janz scored 103. David Ponniah (100 not out in 1967) and Manoj Mendis (124 in 1992) remain as the only Thomians to score centuries on debut.
The rare occasion of scoring more than one century during their Royal-Thomian careers is shared by Thomians Duleep Mendis (1971 & 1972), his nephew Manoj Mendis (1992 & 1993) and Ashan Pieris (2005 & 2007). Only three Thomians have achieved a rare batting double (a century and a fifty) in the same game. They are Willie Jayetileke (62 & 110 not out) in 1937, former Colts CC opener Dhammika Bulankulame (108 & 72) in 1984 and present Sri Lanka all rounder Jeevan Mendis (111 & 54) in 2001. Ex-Thomian and Sri Lanka Test skipper Duleep Mendis, who steamrolled the opposition with 184 in 1972 is still S. Thomas College highest individual scorer.
This year the S. Thomas is coached by experienced coach Dinesh Kumarasinghe (nephew of famous Sri Lankan and CR & FC rugby player Didacus de Almeida), who has nearly 30 years of experience in cricket coaching. So far out of the 138 encounters that have been played, the Thomians have won on 34 occasions with their last win coming in 2007 under Ashan Peiris.

Three former Lankan cricket captains condemn violence
Cricket legends Sanath Jayasuriya, Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardena condemned the acts of violence reported following the tense situation in Kandy area. They requested the public to stay vigilant and ensure harmony among all ethnicities.
Former Sri Lanka Cricket Captain Kumar Sangakkara posting a video on Twitter requested everyone not to be blinded by hatred, ignorance and fear and urged everybody to say no to racism.
To my fellow Sri Lankans, Have we not learned anything from our past Have we lost sight of basic human decency and love Are we morally corrupted that we cannot see our mindless acts are endangering our common future We are responsible for the safety and well being of our neighbours. We are our sisters keepers. We are our brothers keepers. We have to make sure that in Sri Lanka anyone and everyone feels safe, loved and accepted regardless of ethnicity or religion. Sangakkara said.
When we look into the eyes of our Sri Lankan brothers and sisters, we should not see a Sinhalese or a Tamil or a Muslim or a Burgher. We must see ourselves in eachother. We must see the hopes and dreams in their eyes. And we must see the same deep love for our country and for one another. Lets not allow their eyes, our eyes and our vision not to be blinded by ignorance, hatred and by fear. Together, let us say no to racism. he also said.
Sangakkara in a Tweeter message further said that No one in Sri Lanka can be marginalised or threatened or harmed due to their ethnicity or religion. We are one country and one people. Love, trust and acceptance should be our common mantra. No place for racism and violence. Stand together and stand strong.
Former Sri Lankan captain and former politician Sanath Jayasuriya requested the public to act intelligently and demanded the culprits be brought to justice.
Disgusting and sickening to see the acts of violence in Sri Lanka, he tweeted.
I condemn strongly and request to bring the involved culprits to justice. I request people of Sri Lanka to be wise and stay together in these tough times. the twitter massage further said.
Former Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardena vehemently condemned the recent acts of violence and demanded everyone involved to be brought to justice regardless of race, religion or ethnicity.I grew up in a civil war which lasted 25 years and I dont want the next generation to go through that, he tweeted.

Subsidiaries of LAUGFS Gas PLC, LAUGFS Power Ltd, LAUGFS Leisure Ltd and LAUGFS Eco Sri Ltd will be listed separately on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) within the next three months, subject to necessary regulatory approvals from the SEC and the CSE, said H A Ariyaratne, Director, LAUGFS Gas PLC.
Once the segregation is completed by March 31, all different entities will be in a position to operate as independent companies from the financial year commencing April 1 and a person who owns a share of LAUGFS Gas will receive another three shares. As independent companies they will be more dependent on raising funds and having their own strategy formulation and attracting strategic investors which would enable capital infusion, expertise and technology into the business.
W K H Wegapitiya, Chairman of LGL addressing the media on Tuesday said they plan to summon an extra ordinary general meeting on March 20 to get the consent of its shareholders for the restructuring of its non-core businesses.
Wegapitiya said that over 80 percent of the construction work of the LAUGFS Terminals at the Hambantota Port has already been completed and they plan to commence operations in April-May.
There was an initial misunderstanding with Chinese officials manning Hambantota harbour. However this has now been settled and the Chinese too have now understood the value and benefits of our project.
The facility when complete will be the largest LPG import and export terminal in South Asia with a 30,000 MT LPG storage capacity. The Chairman said currently, they owned three ships for LPG transportation, and after the commission of the terminal, they will need seven more. Wegapitiya also said that the planned US$ 100 million expansion of LPG operations in Bangladesh and the setting up of Laugfs operations in Myanmar were also going according to plan.
Capital Alliance Partners Ltd Global Markets & Investment Banking Managing Director Deshan Pushparajah said the companies will be listed at the CSE by introduction and no shares will be issued.

International Womens Day:
Time to acknowledge lethal gender-based violence
My father is a hot-tempered person who gets angry very easily. So I do not know whether the killing was planned or a result of sudden anger.
These are the words of a young woman from Panamure, Sabaragamuwa Province, whose mother was killed by her father in 2016.
She continues: My mother was discharged from hospital recently. She needed time to recover, but he wanted her to go with him. My mother suffered a lot. I have seen my mother being beaten by my father since childhood. He used whatever he could get his hands on to beat her. She had fractured arms and legs several years ago. My mother had to go to hospital this time because my father inserted a wooden pole into her vagina and she was badly hurt.
The technical classification of this type of death is unnatural. Defined as a death not caused by disease or aging but by external causes such as injury, trauma, or poisoning where the manner or circumstance could be homicidal, suicidal or accidental or at times even undetermined, unnatural death is an obscure term that obfuscates a real problem: island-wide, women are dying from intimate partner violence at an alarming rate.
Studying the problem
In December of 2015, the UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) commissioned a research team at the University of Kelaniyas medical faculty to conduct a national study to better understand unnatural deaths of women and girls in relation to intimate partner violence in Sri Lanka.
This study, which was conducted over a span of almost two years and released earlier this week in advance of International Womens Day, is the first of its kind in Sri Lanka. According to the UNFPA, such studies are important not only to find out how and why these deaths occur, but also to ensure justice for the victims families where violence is involved.
A mixed methodology - using both quantitative data and qualitative evidence - was used to gather information, including from police, JMO (judicial medical officers), ISD (industrial safety division) records, and interviews. The unnatural deaths in five provinces in specific from 2016 were studied - Western, Sabaragamuwa, Eastern, Southern, and North Central.
The objectives of the study were threefold. First, the researchers aimed to calculate incidence rates and examine types, injury patterns, and factors associated with unnatural deaths of women and girls in the five selected provinces. Second, the researchers aimed to describe the problems associated with the judicial processes and outcomes relating to unnatural female deaths. And third, the researchers aimed to provide policy inputs and guidelines to address the problems associated with the investigation and judicial processes relating to unnatural female deaths.
Grim results
The results of the study proved nothing to write home about.
Of the total 729 deaths studied, 234 were classified as accidental, 252 as suicides, and 243 as homicides. Thirty-nine percent of homicides and 35 percent of suicides were the result of intimate partner violence. In 36 percent of homicides, the alleged perpetrator was the legal spouse of the victim, and in 21 percent of homicides, it was a blood relative.
According to Anuruddhi Edirisinghe, Professor of Forensic Medicine at the University of Kelaniya and the principle investigator of the study, These results indicate that the system has failed to keep women safe.
Furthermore, in only eight percent of the cases had the deceased woman previously reported the interpersonal violence to law enforcement agencies at least once; in three percent of the cases, the women had reported such violence three or more times. UNFPA country representative Ritsu Nacken said that the low rates of reporting to law enforcement authorities indicate that gender-based violence in the country is still shrouded in silence.
The most common method of suicide was poisoning, and 100 percent of the homicides studied were carried out with sharp force. In three out of every five deaths, the underlying reason was the inability to solve relationship issues. And in one out of every five interpersonal-violence-related homicides, the husband committed suicide after killing the women. Finally, 37 of the homicide victims, or fifteen percent, were raped in advance of being killed.
Distrust of judicial system
In addition to outlining the statistics and causes of unnatural death of women in the country, the UNFPA report also analysed the ways unnatural deaths of women are investigated, and how these investigations are received by the victims families.
According to the report, police and preliminary forensic investigations of unnatural female deaths were concluded within 24 hours in more than 80 percent of the cases.
A majority of those interviewed were comparatively more satisfied with police and forensic investigations than they were with the judicial outcomes.
Police OIC was very supportive and helped us a lot. Our son-in-law was arrested. A wooden rod and some other evidence were collected by the police dogs and he was remanded, said the mother of a female homicide victim from Mandoor, Eastern Province, whose husband killed both her and their eight-month-old child.
But she continued by expressing her disappointment in the judicial process thus far.
The case is not yet concluded. Still court hearings are going on. I am not going to courts regularly. I am fed up now. I do not have any specific expectation of the legal outcome. I have lost trust in people. His family has migrated from here. If there is a God, he will be punished.
Out of the 243 homicides studied, only 47 percent had ever proceeded to the Attorney Generals Department (AGD), whose responsibility it is to file an indictment. And the progress for the cases in which an indictment is issued proceeds too slowly, some say.
At the end of three years, only 30 percent of the cases ever reached the high court for judgement.
There is palpable frustration on the part of families who feel justice hasnt been served.
Its been five years now but still they havent given any punishment to the perpetrator, said a man from the North Central Province whose wife and twelve year old daughter were murdered in a robbery five years ago. I come to the police every month. They have been saying the file is in the Attorney Generals Department.
Recommendations
At a panel event for the launch of the study, experts in the field discussed policy recommendations to address the high rate of unnatural deaths among women and girls due to gender-based and intimate partner violence, in the country.
These recommendations were broken down into three main categories.
The first category is prevention by addressing underlying etiologies. Since one out of every three homicidal and suicidal deaths of women is the result of disharmony in relationships, the report suggested the implementation and expansion of redress mechanisms, gender-sensitive counselling services and support, and gender-sensitive law-enforcement protection and legal aid for those in need.
The enhancement of psycho-social support during bereavement was also suggested. The second category is improvement of the quality of death investigation systems. This, in general, would require coordination between and strict impartiality and gender-sensitive conduct on the part of all the main stakeholders who investigate deaths.
Also suggested was the establishment of guidelines and institutional standard operational procedures for the investigation of unnatural deaths, the accreditation of laboratories, the establishment deadlines for report submission and annual audits, and the incorporation of public feedback into each process.
The final category of policy recommendation is to make the court system which supposedly administers justice more efficient. This, the reports authors and panelists explained, would require, first and foremost, clearing of the current backlog of cases.
As well, it would require reforms to the legal and penal codes
Media must do its part too
In addition to the main policy brief released by the UNFPA this week, another study, on reportage of such unnatural deaths, was released by the organization as well.
Analyzing the ways unnatural deaths of women are reported in English, Sinhala, and Tamil newspapers, the study found that such deaths often receive wide-reaching media coverage because the incidents cause much speculation.
Yet while the country does have legal frameworks within which the media are expected to operate, according to the UNFPA they often do not.
While newspaper coverage in all three languages is problematic, very often reportage of unnatural deaths in the Sinhala newspapers do not conform to ethical guidelines or accepted ethical standards of reportage, the report explained. It chastised both Sinhala and Tamil newspapers for identifying victims by their names and addresses, exposing them and their families to visibility and speculation, as well as identifying alleged perpetrators and suspects, subjecting them to scrutiny before theyve been proven guilty.
The report also pointed out widespread sensationalism in coverage of such unnatural deaths.
There is a high degree of sensationalism and emotiveness in the writing, photography, headlines, colouring, details, spacing, and positioning of articles in the Sinhala newspapers.
Innuendo and embellishment are found to distort information.
In order to combat what the UNFPA classified as harmful reportage, it impressed upon the media in attendance of the launch event, its responsibility to not exploit grief or do anything that might retraumatize victims families or put anyone at risk.
A full list of suggestions and guidelines for the media, as well as both policy briefs in full, can be found on the UNFPA Sri Lanka website.

US metal tariffs: Mexico and Canada may be exempt, White House says

The White House says there could be exemptions to US plans to impose tariffs on metal imports, in a softening of its tough stance.
Canada, Mexico and other countries may see "carve-outs" on national security grounds, a spokeswoman said.
US President Donald Trump has said steel products will face a 25% tariff, with 10% on aluminium goods.
Meanwhile, China threatened an "appropriate and necessary response" in any trade war with the US.
Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China and the US should strive to be partners rather than rivals.
The EU has proposed retaliatory measuresagainst a number of US goods including bourbon and peanut butter.
Despite opposition at home and abroad, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the US president would sign the measures in by the end of the week, with US media reporting it could happen as early as Thursday.
But she added: "There are potential carve-outs for Mexico and Canada based on national security, and possibly other countries as well based on that process. That would be [on] a case-by-case and country by country basis."
President Trump has previously suggested that planned tariffs for Canada and Mexico could be abandoned if a "new and fair" North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) is signed.
Why is Trump doing this
Trump has railed against the US trade deficit, arguing that other countries have been "taking advantage of" the US for decades.
One of his campaign promises was to rebuild the US steel and aluminium industries which he said has suffered "disgraceful" treatment from other countries, in particular cheap Chinese imports.
Last week he dismissed concerns he could trigger a trade war, instead saying "trade wars are good" and were something the US would easily win.
Trump has already hinted he could drop plans to impose tariffs on Mexican and Canadian metals but linked it to the US getting a better deal in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
Mexico and Canada are among the main suppliers of steel to the US.
What's the reaction been
The US plans have sparked worldwide alarm and jolted stock markets.
Critics argue that the tariffs would fail to protect American jobs and would ultimately raise prices for consumers.
International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde warned "nobody wins" in a trade war, saying it would harm global economic growth.
The EU has set out tit-for-tat plans to impose import duties on bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice, steel, and industrial products. Other countries are also considering retaliatory steps.
Members of Trump's Republican party are concerned too, with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying he wanted to see tariffs that were "more surgical and more targeted".
Tuesday saw the departure of top White House economic advisor Gary Cohn, who is a strong supporter of free trade.

This violence against our fellow citizens must stop now!- Rosy
Every right-thinking, decent Sri Lankan is at this moment in anguish at the racially motivated violence in the Kandy district. A few days ago it was Ampara and before that Aluthgama. Remembering the dark days of July 1983, we need to be aware of how such a situation can get out of control and have deeper and long-lasting effects that would affect us as a people and as a united country, states Mayor Elect Colombo Municipal Council Rosy Senanayake in a release.
The release states:Our inability to see situations of conflict and the dangers contained therein is what is of concern. We cannot adopt a wait-and-see attitude that gives time for hate mongers to get a foothold and to inflame the narrative to their advantage as we see today.
They obviously have an arrogant agenda that is supported by blinded supporters. History has shown us that race and religion are the most convenient ways for such extremists to gain a foothold and if we as a nation take a passive view, they will succeed and we will have no one to blame but ourselves. We have to pressurize those in power to be more pro-active and to nip such situations in the bud  regrettably we have failed and the country is facing the consequences of our inactivity.
However, it is not too late  we still have a window of opportunity to voice our concern and to resort to real action but if we fail to do that, the country as a whole will be poorer for it.
I call upon all fellow SRI LANKANS, regardless of ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic background or political affiliation, to take a firm stand and show this group of hate mongers that they do not represent you, that they do not represent an ethnicity or a religion, and that they certainly do not represent Sri Lanka. That would be the patriotic thing to do!

Voice against violence
She embodies a belief in her own abilities without fear of limitations. Together with her team at the Girl Scouts and Sri Lanka Girl Guides Association (SLGGA) she works to provide a mental health boost for life by helping individuals develop their full potential as leaders and active citizens of the world.
Working as the coordinator (volunteer service) for SLGGAs Stop The Violence Campaign which started off in 2013, Chamathya Fernando made her mark globally when she won the Global Emerging Young Leader Award last year. The United States Department of State selects 10 youth each year to felicitate them for the courage they have shown by resolving conflict, promoting security, and creating economic opportunities in challenging environments.
A past pupil of Vishakha Vidyalaya, Colombo, Chamathya, has been engaging in social service activities through Little Friends and Girl Guiding. She soon developed a passion for addressing social issues and wished to take her work forward to a much bigger scale through the Sri Lanka Girl Guides Association.
I have gone through certain experiences and know how uncomfortable I have felt in such instances. A girl or a boy going through such or greater harassment makes me feel that I need to do something from my end. I strive to educate at least one person to make a difference and the satisfaction I receive in the feedback motivates me, says the 24 year old who became a Presidents Guide in 2010.
Chamathya had represented Sri Lanka and the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) as a youth delegate at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, at the UN Headquaters, New York, for three consecutive years. She was also a youth speaker for the UN Womens Stakeholders Forum held at the UN Headquarters in 2013 and for the Community of Democracies Ministerial held at the US Department of State, Washington DC in 2017.
Speaking about her experience as a youth delegate at the UN Commission on the Status of Women Chamathya said that she met many men and women who played leading roles in engaging in campaigns related to gender equality.
They trained the youth delegates on the Stop The Violence Campaign - a global advocacy campaign linked to the World Association. Research has revealed that the biggest issue that women face is violence and harassment, she said adding that she is the first Girl Guide from Sri Lanka to take part in the event.
She notes that she always stresses upon the topic of violence against women and girls.
Girls are often neglected because of their gender and age. There are certain issues that are mostly faced by girls such as harassment linked to the digital media. Girls and young women are mostly in contact with such devices and face such complications. I started the campaign locally and on a small scale by visiting schools. We lacked funds and we basically used our own money as well as spared our free time for the projects. The World Association took note of the work we put in with the limited resources we had. They gave a funding in 2014 to expand the campaign. Therefore I was able to take the Stop The Violence Campaign to district and provincial level, Chamathya said.
The Activate Training organised by UN Women and WAGGGS on the Voices Against Violence curriculum held at Sangam, WAGGGS World Centre, India, in 2014 marked another milestone in her journey.
Due to this we were able to have national trainers in Sri Lanka and move the campaign to the 25 districts covering the nine provinces and conduct the workshop in Sinhala, Tamil and English. Now we have 65 trainers delivering the curriculum age appropriately to areas such as Jaffna and Batticaloa too. We have activity based work for each age group on the themes of gender, violence, harassment and the steps they need to take to protect themselves. We also involve boys and men in the campaign, she explained adding that the need for equal rights has to be a collective effort.She says that the campaign also stresses upon sustainability and values.
At times you start a project but find out that the work does not progress after a span. The participants of our workshops were very interactive and identified the problems in their areas themselves. We understood that the campaign has a life changing impact on their lives and on the community as a whole, she said adding that Stop The Violence Campaign is headed by six youth: Dasuni Athauda, Dumidu Thabrew, Kenneth Amunugama, Venuri Kalinga, Anuradha Uswattage.
Child abuse, harassment and teenage pregnancies prevail on a large scale in the society. Sometimes we find that teachers are a bit shy to start off this kind of conversation due to our culture. We need to understand our situation and give the solution. As youth we need to do something from our end for the betterment of our country and society, Chamathya opined.
Their efforts were recognized globally and they were invited to take their campaign to Bangladesh. They trained around 66 participants at the Bangladesh STV National Training of Trainers in Dhaka, Bangladesh in January 2018.
Recalling her experience at the Global Emerging Young Leaders Awards Chamathya said that she had to take part in an exchange program at the event as well.
We had to use the social media to take our work to a bigger audience. I spent a day with an American family to experience how their family system works. The mother of the family I stayed with runs a home school. She is a public speaker and educates her children at home. We visited different organizations in the US to see how they find solutions to their issues. They too have their own set of problems like teenage pregnancies, internal refugees, and conflicts between the Black Americans and White Americans, Chamathya mused.
She says that she has always felt that the lack of education and awareness in both men and women is one of the main causes for these kind of gender based issues.
Women are unaware that they are entitled to the same rights. I feel that educating and creating awareness on such matters is very important. Start this conversation with anyone, anywhere.
You need to respect each individual despite their gender and give them their space. If you violate their rights, then it is a crime. Celebrities speaking out about the harassments they faced in their field is good to create awareness. People initiate conversations and start campaigns but at the same time you need to realise that the knowledge needs to be given to a child at an early age.
We stereotype aspects in life like colours, toys, occupations and activities according to a persons gender. This is the root of the problem. You need to make them realize that this is a shared role, she stressed.
Chamathyas father, Christie Fernando, is an engineer while her mother, Lalitha Fernando, was into banking. Her sister, Chathu, lives with her family in Australia.
Plan International has chosen Chamathya as one of the 10 members of their Young Influencers group for an upcoming global project. The STV team are also planning workshops in areas like Meemure and Jaffna. They hope to have another national training workshop for both male and female youth.

When Trinity beat St. Anthonys after 35 years
The 101st Kandys Battle of the Blues will take place on Friday and Saturday at Asgiriya Stadium. Recalling memories of the Trinity-Antonian game of 1986, which the Trinitians won by seven wickets to break a 35-year hoodoo. That year the Trinitians were led by T. P. Weerasuriya and the Antonians by Rienzie Perera.
This great win for the Trinitians would not have been possible if not for the sporty and challenging declaration made by the Antonian skipper. He threw the game wide open and the Trinitians who accepted the challenge found the going easy during the last stages as the Antonians were a tired lot and ran short of bowlers after the start of the 20 mandatory overs. Today this sort of declaration is not seen because they go for huge totals to gain first innings points and for individual performances. The winning run a boundary to the long-on fence was hit by burly left hander Romesh Jayawardene in the 14th mandatory over.
In this big un the Trinity skipper failed to call correctly and St. Anthonys elected to take first turn of a placid Katugastota wicket. The Katugastota boys topped the 50 mark for the loss of just one wicket but with the introduction of the spinners C. I. Fernando and Selvaratnam Ratnakumaran the Antonians found themselves in trouble and were dismissed for a paltry 126. Opener Suresh Peiris 24, Damian Nadaraja 23 with four hits to the ropes, Nimalaka Perera 24 with four fours, Sahib Thariquishad 20, Suresh Alwis 11 in 69 minutes and skipper Rienzie Perera with an aggressive 14 studded with three fours batted best. Right arm spinner Selvaratnam Ratnakumaran bowled 23.4 overs, 10 of which were maidens. The Trinitians fielded well with stumper Mevan Ballale performing well holding three good catches and also stumping skipper Reinzie Perera. The ever agile Ballale set an example to the rest of his teammates. This was one of the lowest score made by an Antonian side against Trinity for quite some time. The Antonians 126 came in 240 minutes after 67.4 overs.
The Asgiriya boys in reply were off to a sound start but with the score at 28, A. K. Premasinghe foolishly ran himself out. Wickets fell at regular intervals and Trinity ended the first day at 86 for 6. Mevan Ballale 21, Chaminda Unnantenne 31 n.o. and Romesh Jayawardene 15 made useful contributions towards Trinitys score. Rienzie Perera returned impressive figures of 4 for 34 in 15 overs, in which three of them were maidens. There were two run outs in the Trinity innings.
Continuing from 86 for 6, Trinity found themselves in trouble as their overnight batsmen failed and the last four wickets fell for 12 runs within the space of 15 minutes. C. I. Fernando was run out while C. Unnantenne who was 31 overnight was in a mighty hurry, that he played a rash stroke to be dismissed for 38 which had five hits to the ropes. Rienzie Perera added two more scalps and finished with figures of 6 for 39 in 17 overs. Trinity were bowled out for 98 in 161 minutes off 41 overs.
St. Anthonys enjoying a first innings lead of 28 runs, were expected to make quick runs and consolidate their position, instead they batted without purpose and were 55 for 3 at lunch having batted for 105 minutes and faced 28 overs. At 2.35 p.m. St. Anthonys declared with a score of 160 for 7. Anurudha Seneviratne made a top score of 47 with eight fours. Opener Suresh Peries got 40 with six fours but batted for 129 minutes facing 101 balls, Rienzie Perera made a breezy 23 which had a six and two fours. Sixteen-year-old Ruwan Kalpage chipped in with an unbeaten 24 which included four hits to the fence and a well-timed six which landed on the tiers accommodating the Antonian tent. It was good fun anyway and the boys cheered lustily, Selvaratnam Ratnakumaran 3 for 67 and C. I. Fernando 3 for 39 shared the wickets. Ratnakumaran who had a match bag of 6 for 100 was presented with the best bowlers award.
The Trinitians set to make 190 to win in 90 minutes and 20 mandatory overs, were given a sound start by Mevan Ballale and S. K. Premasinghe who put on 93 runs in 100 minutes. Premasinghe was dismissed for 39. Ballale joined by Sujeewa Jayawardene took the score to 144 before Jayawardene was run out for 14. Chaminda Unnantenne joined Ballale who was batting at his best, tried to force the pace and was adjudged run out with his individual score at 81. Ballales match winning innings was studded with ten fours and a glorious six which landed on a roof erected behind the Old Antonians SC. Ballale was given a rousing ovation on his way back to the pavilion by the large crowd. Unannetenne normally an aggressive bat made 29 which had three fours and 2 sixes and Romesh Jayawardene 20 saw Trinity achieving their target without further loss. Trinitys 191 for 3 came in 150 minutes off 35.1 overs. The happiest man on this day was Trinity coach J.A. Shaw Wilson, a product of Royal College who helped the Trinitians to break the 35-year-old hoodoo. Shaw is the present Vice Principal of Trinity.

Woman, her charm and pride
Human beings can never speak of women without bowing their heads in gratitude to three of the greatest women who walked on mother earth. They, as mothers gave to the world three sons whose words on Karuna, Meththa, Forgiveness, submission, Love and peace lifted the minds of mankind to do good.
Woman is natures or Gods most consummate creation. She is always with us. She brings us into being. We are cradled in her arms. She guards us with devotion. We may look plain, but she sees beauty in us. Yes! To the mother of the scary looking Tasmanian monster her offspring is the prettiest. A woman will sacrifice comfort, sleep, food and her life to serve mankind.
Woman has been a part of the world and the human race from the beginning of time. She is by no means a mans source of recreation but the sagacious citadel of procreation.
A womans constant and unwearied ministry is what makes the word home the sweetest in the world. She is our guardian from cradle to grave. A woman carries a quiver full of arrows of love and peace.
We walk back in time. A smiling matron carries a babe. It is a girl, she coos, while placing her in the pink laced cot, all in raptures. A woman begins to suckle, to be fed by another woman - another addition to feminine gender. She grows up in a cozy cauldron of gossip where with every word a reputation falls, makeup, fashion and dolls  a mischievous elfin.
From an unforgettable childhood to the vivacious adulthood she likes to imitate the mother and the real star artistes appearing in the large and small screens. Pampered by a doting thaththa, whose dreams are shared with Amma, beautiful dreams about the future of an angel.
Then education becomes happy memories. Trophies for achievements in class and in the sport field pave the way to the future.
Then a proposal or a sweet love affair ends with a wedding. In a lovely white saree, exquisite jewellery, carrying a heavenly bouquet of white flowers, she walks with her spouse, clad in stylishly tailored dark suit. A slight digression. Thaththa, why do brides always wear white Duwa, white signifies purity. Amma, then why do bridegrooms wear black Amma was silent. Women will flyaway from the home of her parents to build a new home amidst embraces, tears, confetti and waves. We remember with nostalgia the song of Mignnone Fernando kadallay and Professor Carlo Fonsekas Raththaran duwe Then ponder on the words of Leon Uris in his masterpiece The Egyptian quote; the greatest gift a woman can give to a man is her innocence, which she can give only once.
The woman goes to live with another woman - husbands mother. The duel of the in-laws is common the world over. Truly if a woman can remember that once she was a daughter-in-law and the other will one day be a mother-in-law, then surely that obnoxious word in-law could be deleted from the dictionary. The woman as a sister becomes a symbol of care for her younger members of the family. Along with an understanding spouse, she helps them without measure. A woman as a sister becomes a mother, to others under her wings and history repeats itself. The woman is in labour. Pain mingles with joy. How true are the words in verse Le kiri karala.
The family grows. The woman takes over. She keeps the home fires burning. In short she becomes the home central bank. She washes her wedding ring thrice a day- morning, noon and night in dish water to keep the family in good health. The woman as a mother is ever alert to the needs of the family.
Who keeps-awake to mark the temperature and administer antibiotics Who attends to the laundry work, in keeping the house clean and in keeping the children under her watchful and affectionate care At times, running around with soot and tear filled eyes brandishing the pol katuhanda (coconut shell ladle). Most important of all, the woman as mother is there to take the family up to the altar of the beautiful teachers in whom they believe to pray and thank for all the sweet favours received.
A woman as a professional and heroine we cannot forget. Countess Cinchona who showed that a bark of a tree could yield quinine, the bitter medicine for the malaria infested world of yester year, Madam Curie gave us Radium, Florence Nightingale became an institution when her caring for the afflicted in war, armed with a lamp ushered in the world, caring angels in caps.
The indispensable nursing sisters, yes she helped the woman medical specialists. Grace Darling helps her father by waving a lantern, guiding the ships to sea when the light house lamp fails to give light. Maria Montessori gave the toddlers a unique system of understanding ABC and 123.
Immortal authors, whose works have been translated to many languages - Rebecca, Jane Austens Pride and Prejudice, Margret Mitchells, gone with the wind Rachel Carsons Cry my beloved country and Henrywoods East Lynne-made in to film in Tamil as Thaai Ullam. Can we forget these women of greatness
Now, we remember and salute one of the noblest women. Queen Viharamahadevi who bequeathed to us a noble and brave king who, from his heroic and meritorious deeds showed his righteousness by decreeing that all who pass the tomb of a very just king whom he had slain in battle should pay their respect to his royal opponent - a wonderful son of an outstanding woman and a mother stature.
Our women, in this little gem of an Isle were given the honour of using their franchise. They could vote. This was in the 1930s long before many other countries thought it fit that their women who keep them and all mortal beings in the cozy confines of their water bags for nearly 264 days, were eligible to vote.
We astounded the world with a Guinness record which made Madam Tusseuds wax works in London to erect a model of the first ever elected woman Prime Minister of the world Sirimavo Bandaranaike of then Ceylon.
We created a precedent. Some say woman thou art fraility - a fallacy. She will be there ad-infinitum. The hand that rocks the cradle shall rule the world, in her own imitable way.

INTERNATIONAL WOMENS DAY MESSAGES:
Women, equal partners in development: President
Women enjoy the unique position of ensuring sustainability of human civilization with their reproductive ability and were honoured since ancient times. The modern cultural human being acknowledges that she has a more social value than that significant biological factor, stated President Maithripala Sirisena, sending a message marking International Womens Day.
The message added: I am pleased to send this message of greetings to the International Women's Day celebrated by the entire world community to make that belief into a common social reality while extending my best wishes to all the efforts taken to ensure the dignity of women that they richly deserve.
Sri Lanka is a country, which granted the franchise to women even before many developed Western countries. As a result of this developed social background, Sri Lanka was able to produce the world's first woman Prime Minister as well as the first Executive President.
I am pleased that we are far ahead of many developing countries in granting equal educational and professional rights to women. The right to education has paved the way for women in our country to secure highest positions in the administrative system of the country. Furthermore, in recent times, legislations have been adopted to strengthen women's participation in governance, and we were able to make this a reality at the recently held local government elections.
Our next objective is to develop female entrepreneurship and to increase female participation in industries and production. Thus, special loan schemes and entrepreneur training programmes have been implemented at government and non-governmental level. The final objective of all these programmes is to ensure that the females of the country, amounting to half the entire population, become equal partners of a nation which possesses a high social development.
I believe the theme Roads to development - Unveiled by her strength in this International Womens Day celebration would usher in an important debate on these progressive social development objectives.
I wish all the programmes organized with the aim of achieving these important objectives every success and offer my best wishes to all those women who participate in them.

Women to the fore
The best protection any woman can have... is courage. - Elizabeth Cady Stanton, American suffragist and social activist
When the Time Magazine honoured the Silence Breakers as its Person of the Year 2017, the world took notice of a rising wave of resistance and protests against the harassment of girls and women worldwide. The Me Too movement on social media amplified the voices of those who spoke up against violence targeted at women.
Today, on International Women's Day (IWD), there will be renewed focus on the issue of sexual and physical harassment against women, as well the gender pay gap, under-representation of women in politics, business and other professions, trafficking and slavery of women, the lack of educational opportunities for women in many countries and inequality.
The first women's day was observed in February 1909 when 15,000 women marched through the streets of New York demanding improved pay, shorter hours and voting rights. An annual international women's day was first organised by the German socialist and theorist Clara Zetkin along with 100 delegates from 17 countries in March 1911. In 1975, the United Nations proclaimed the year International Womens Year and christened March 8 as Womens Day. IWD is a global celebration of the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. The day is also a call to action through events large and small focusing on equality. It is also a national holiday in many countries.
This year, there are two dominant themes for IWD. The theme #Press for Progress is a push for gender parity worldwide. Women are predicted to face another 118-year wait for the gender pay gap to close, with only 55 of the 500 richest people in the world being women. Many leading companies have admitted that women receive lower pay and are working to rectify it.
In politics, only a fifth of parliamentary seats worldwide are held by women and only 19 Heads of State out of a possible 196 are women - only seven more women than 20 years ago. Despite producing the worlds first woman Prime Minister way back in 1960, Sri Lanka fares rather badly in this aspect, with womens representation being just 6 percent in Parliament and 2 percent at Local Government level, though the last Local Government Poll sought to rectify this by stipulating a 25 percent quota for women.
More than a third of women worldwide have also experienced physical or sexual violence at some point in their lives mostly at the hands of relatives and close associates, with this being most common between teenage years and menopause. One in three girls in the developing world is married off before the 18th birthday, amounting to more than 15 million girls every year. More than 140 million girls and women alive today have undergone some form of female genital mutilation. Clearly, there is much progress still to be made.
The other main theme The Time is Now: Rural and Urban Activists Transforming Womens Lives is also appropriate in todays context. This year, International Womens Day comes on the heels of unprecedented global movement for womens rights, equality and justice. Sexual harassment, violence and discrimination against women has captured headlines and public discourse, propelled by a rising determination for change. International Womens Day 2018 is an opportunity to transform this momentum into action, to empower women in all settings, rural and urban, and celebrate the activists who are working relentlessly to claim womens rights and realize their full potential. International Womens Day will draw attention to the rights and activism of rural women, who make up over a quarter of the world population and majority of the 43 percent of women in the global agricultural labour force. For instance, less than 20 percent of landholders worldwide are women, and while the global pay gap between men and women stand at 23 per cent, in rural areas, it can be as high as 40 percent. They lack infrastructure and services, decent work and social protection, and are left more vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
IWD is also an opportunity to consider how to accelerate the 2030 Agenda, on Sustainable Development Goals, especially goal number 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Some key targets of the 2030 Agenda are: By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education; End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere; Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation; Eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation. The target year is only 12 years away, but most, if not all, of these goals can be achieved if States have the political will to enact the necessary legislative and other tangible changes. The time for change and action is now.

INTERNATIONAL WOMENS DAY MESSAGES:
Encourage women to play greater role
Today, the time is right for us to focus on initiating a platform that assures women gain adequate recognition and empowerment while creating a just and equal society for all. Sustaining an environment that encourages women to play a greater role in society, remains key towards progress, stated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his message marking International Womens Day.
The message stated: Women already shoulder considerable responsibilities not only in the home but also in the workplace - their contribution to the well-being of the nation and the society at large remains vital.
The theme of International Women's Day 2018 She empowers and lights the path of progress is, therefore, both apt and relevant towards the greater acknowledgement of women as partners and participants in today's seamless global environment.
Although women's participation in education, management, arts and many other spheres remain considerable, the same cannot be said for their political representation.
Hence, ensuring 25% participation of female candidates in the recently concluded local government elections must be viewed as a step indeed in the right direction - one that empowers women to play a greater role in the national political arena.
Our Government reiterates its commitment towards creating the economic and social conditions necessary for women and the community in general to live safe and productive lives; while inviting Sri Lankan women to play a strategic role in fuelling the Government's initiatives.
"I take this opportunity to wish all a productive International Women's Day.

Irresponsible social media usage  detrimental to stock exchange activities
The practice of using social media platforms to disseminate information without any restrains or responsibility is ushering in a harmful trend and it will be detrimental to the stability and the movement of the stock exchange activities, said Prof. Maithree Wickramasinghe.
Prof. Wickramasinghe made these observations at an event organized to ring the opening bell for trading at Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) to celebrate International Womens Day 2018.
The event was held in collaboration with IFC, a member of the World Bank Group and the Government of Australia.
Stock exchange depends on stability and today one of the greatest threats to the stock exchange comes from social media. Any individual who possess a laptop or a mobile with an internet connection has the power to receive and disseminate news without any restrains or responsibility.
Prof. Wickramasinghe also noted it is unfortunate that the law enforcement authorities have not been well equipped with technology or capacity to curtail the impact of fake and hateful contents that harm the mutual trust, diversity and harmony among local communities.
Sometimes, we do not adequately condemn these activities. There is a need to identify the citizens rights and civic responsibilities to prevent commotions and violence of this nature and to prevent any politically heightened differences. Then only, we are able to celebrate diversity, unity and peace.
It is important at this juncture to keep in mind that none of us has a singular or essential identity. We may have an identity as women and men. And also, we may have other identities in terms of profession, sexual orientation, language, class, education, geography, age, politics and so on.
Commenting on gender equality, Prof. Wickramasinghe also noted that equality involves accepting commonality, considering the common rights of men and women and ensuring equal employments, promotions and opportunities for women.
Primarily it involves looking at numbers in terms of nomination, domination, representation and participation within the labour force and employment structure, industries and horizontal and vertical work sectors and structures and so on. We need to look at gender equity, as gender equity involves looking at differences between men and women, and more importantly between men and men and women and women.
Prof. Wickramasinghe also stated that Sri Lanka is still battling for gender sensitive and gender appropriate work spaces, work facilities and work infrastructure.
Gender equity is presumed to fulfill these gender expectations of women and leads to social justice, she noted.
Amena Arif - IFC Country Manager for Sri Lanka and the Maldives speaking at the event noted that there is an enhanced amount of compelling evidence for the importance of gender diversity and equality both on board level and in suitable positions.Gender diversity is the right thing to do; not just because it is the right thing to do, because it will immensely contribute towards the growth of the private sector, Arif noted.

Real Estate sector in North-East yet to boom
The Real Estate sector in the North East is yet to boom and the main reason for this is the lack of infrastructure, said founder and managing director of the PropertyGuru, Asia Property Awards, and Terry Blackburn.
Speaking at an event in Ramada Colombo he said that no major apartment or hotel projects have shaped up in the North East recently despite the residents having a large disposable income mainly accumulated from relatives living overseas.
The nonavalability of a highway, air fare being too expensive and limited infrastructure are some of the main reasons for North East to fall out in this segment.
Today there are several high rise apartment complexes that are being built in the South and the main reason for this is the highway.
JLL Sri Lanka, MD, Steven Mayes predicted that the land prices in Colombo 1, 2 and 3 are likely to peak this year and development of the Colombo Port City is one key reason for it. Mayes said that Colombo Port City will be a game changer as it would be the key to promote development of infrastructure in Colombo and asserted that the reintroduction of 15% VAT on new condominium sales will have a detrimental effect on its sales as it will dampen demand and weaken the sentiment. Due to high construction costs, severe labour shortage and reintroduction of VAT, he said that developers will have to discount, incentivize and up their marketing game, if sales volumes are to be maintained.
Mayes highlighted that there is a big vacuum for international Grade A office spaces in Colombo and also four star business hotels. Real Estate sectorFrom i

The 2017 event took place in Singapore last November.
This certainly provides a platform for the local industry to showcase their capabilities to a wider audience and be recognised on a regional stage. I consider it a privilege to be part of this historic event.

Bank of Ceylon extends  Branch on Wheels to other provinces
BOC Branch on Wheels extends its service to several other provinces including Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Northern, and Uva Province providing many more customers of the region the convenience of Banking.
This mobile branch vehicle includes a teller counter, customer area, ATM, and a self service KIOSK. A wider range of banking services such as cash deposits and withdrawals, fund transfers, bill payments, accounts opening, applying for loans and internet banking are provided here. With the online connectivity the mobile branch has, a transaction that would be done at or through this branch would be updated real-time.
BOC Branch on Wheels is introduced in line with the Government objective to bring in the un-bankable population in the country to the banking stream through extending modern banking facilities to customers in remote areas and building their confidence in the banking stream. Even these modern banking facilities are hard to reach for some; mobile branch will go up to the customer breaking psychological and geographic barriers to make banking more feasible.
Enabled as a part of the digital transformation, the Bank takes this initiative very seriously. To ensure that the entire country is covered, the Bank will assign a mobile branch for each province. By doing so it will be able to cover wider ground area and reach a wider customer base ranging from a busy marketplace, to a school, hospital and any type of organization or factory, at the convenience of the customer. The branch will be deployed according to a pre-decided schedule to operate as a routine branch. It will also serve as a service station when mobilizing special events in the region. BOC also looks forward to strategically placing this as a part of a recovery plan to support relief operations in disaster situations to assist customers immediately in their time of need.
Digitally altering the Sri Lankan Banking landscape, BOC pioneered to elevate the countrys banking industry significantly in par with the international standards bringing a world-class banking experience to its customers. With the responsibility of a Bank with a state ownership it has spread its service across the country to cater every Sri Lankan.

Rumour mongers should be taken to task:
Be astute statesmen and responsible citizens
The ugly heads of ethnic tension and communal disharmony raised themselves this week as the government clamped down hard on unrest in the Central Province, even if its own political course remained unclear almost a month after the local government elections.
At the time of writing, the declaration of a state of emergency had been announced for a period of seven days following clashes in Digana and Teldeniya which had the potential to escalate into a conflict between the Sinhalese and Muslim communities on a greater scale. Police curfews were also being imposed in areas thought to be at higher risk.
A concern in government circles is that incidents which would otherwise be personal disputes are being exploited, giving them a communal undertone. The incidents in Digana and Teldeniya were sparked by the death of a Sinhalese man who was reportedly severely assaulted by several Muslim youths. The unrest forged a life of its own and evolved, leading to the destruction of several Muslim owned shops and houses from which the body of a Muslim youth had been recovered.
That this senseless violence comes days after similar- if not so severe- clashes erupted in Ampara is a cause for serious concern to the authorities. The issue at stake in Ampara was a myth propagated through rumour and social media that Muslim owned restaurants were introducing sterilisation pills into food consumed by Sinhalese customers.
Nationalist and racist rhetoric
This is not medically possible because oral contraceptive medication usually needs to be taken by females in a regular manner. However, the myth seemed real to those inflamed by nationalist and racist rhetoric propagated through social media and word of mouth. That the incidents in Ampara in the Eastern Province and Digana and Teldeniya in the Central Province occurred only days apart, appears to be too much of a co-incidence.
Even if they did occur spontaneously and were not orchestrated, there is no shortage of groups willing to take advantage of the circumstances. Venerable Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera, the head of the Bodu Bala Sena organisation which is known for its persecution of minority communities was quick to visit the funeral house of the Sinhalese victim and his presence there wouldnt have helped to ease tensions. Buddhist monks were also at the forefront of demanding the release of those charged with arson in the violence there.
On the political front, Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP) leader Wimal Weerawansa was quick to seize the situation to discredit the government, as he is wont to do. Weerawansa accused the government of being lethargic in dealing with the unrest deliberately.
When people resorted to violence, the government turned a blind eye because it was an excuse to suppress burning issues. The government wanted to do so because it wanted to divert attention from the crisis in over the Premiership and the United Nations Human Rights Council sessions, Weerawansa claims. Such allegations are of course Weerawansas hallmark, although most would consider them preposterous because the government wouldnt surely want another issue to contend with at this critical stage.
There have however been several indications that law enforcement authorities were not, at least at first, quick to clampdown on the growing unrest, perhaps underestimating its consequences. Both Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament that initial investigations suggest that persons who are not from the locality may be involved in propagating the violence.
Buddhist and the Islamic clergy in Digana and Teldeniya were engaged in a dialogue to resolve the issue peacefully but a group of extremists who had come from elsewhere were engaged in violence Prime Minister Wickremesinghe told Parliament. Inquiries, under the direction of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe are underway to probe this more extensively.
Communal unrest
President Sirisena also declared that action would be taken against those seeking to create more communal unrest. Stern action would be taken against those who breach peace and provoke citizens by spreading rumours and false news by various means, including social media platforms, the President said in a special statement. If the law and order situation in the Central Province was a key focus of attention, so was the Law and Order portfolio within the Cabinet. At the recent Cabinet reshuffle, the portfolio was taken away from Sagala Ratnayaka and vested with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. However Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne is on record saying this is a temporary measure and the ministry would be brought under Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka.
The current impasse has arisen because parliamentarians of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) oppose such a move. It has been reported that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had made several representations to the President in this regard and so has Fonseka himself.
The Presidents predicament in vesting this ministry with the decorated soldier who served jail time under the previous regime must be viewed in the current political context. In the aftermath of the local government elections, it is no secret that overtures were made by President Sirisena to the dissident faction of the SLFP headed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Joint Opposition (JO) group in Parliament.
The JO is thus far playing hard to get. They have mooted a motion of no-confidence against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. They have also stated that in the event such a motion is successful and a SLFP led government is formed, they will not accept any portfolios but would provide conditional support. The JO also demands the Opposition Leaders position. These are difficult demands to agree to, even if the SLFP is able to muster enough numbers to oust Prime Minister Wickremesinghe- which they havent been able to do.
Local government election
The SLFP- as well as the UNP- realise that one key issue at the local government election was the governments inability to punish those who were corrupt in the previous regime. If this is done now by entrusting Field Marshal Fonseka with the task and he executes it with the same precision he dismantled the Tamil Tiger terrorists, the JO leadership as well as some in the mainstream SLFP could find themselves having to answer some difficult questions.
With SLFPers in the government now seeing rapprochement with the JO as their only path to survival at the next general election, they oppose Fonsekas appointment as Minister of Law and Order. The UNP and the SLFP are in a stand-off on this issue now, reminiscent of when former President Chandrika Kumaratunga refused to swear in S. B. Dissanayake as the Minister in charge of the Samurdhi programme in the UNP led government of 2001. In that instance, Kumaratunga eventually yielded and Dissanayake was sworn-in. The JO meanwhile is keen to push through its agenda for a motion of no-confidence against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. A few UNP backbenchers were supportive of the move but the JO then announced that it had been postponed. The reason it gave was the current unrest in the country but observers say it is more than likely it was because it lacked the sufficient numbers in Parliament.
The political climate in the nation is therefore in a state of flux. What is important that in the midst of all this, the country does not hurtle into yet another ethnic conflict. For such a calamity to be prevented however, its political leaders of all hues should act as astute statesmen- not petty politicians.

The Beast Rides Again
...they can hate so much theyll tear the world to pieces.Arthur Miller (All My Sons)
Even as I write these words, Kandy is burning.
Muslims, their homes and their properties are being targeted in the name of Buddhism, within shouting distance of the Temple of the Tooth. If the custodians of the Tooth Relic, the chief prelates of Malwatte and Asgiriya, look out from their windows, theyd probably see the smoke from the fires, if not the fires and the fire-makers.
There is no greater perversion of Buddhism than killing in the name of Buddhism. In the Buddhas teachings there is no place for any kind of violence, no concept of holy war or just war, no room for revenge, whatever the crime. It the chief prelates are true followers of the Buddha, they would have walked going among the rioters, pleading for calm. But the only monks visible and audible in Kandy seem to be those who are feeding the fires. The chief prelates and other leading monks are silent, no word of condemnation, no plea for sanity and peace. If Kandy-burning symbolises the failure of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, the silence of the monks indicates why that failure happened.
The chief prelates were silent in July 1983 as well.
There is an image from Black July I will carry with me for the rest of my life: a Tamil woman being pushed into the roaring fire of a shop by a mob in Kirulapone, as the police watched. I still remember that she was thin and not tall, had salt-and-pepper hair and was wearing a sari. I couldnt see her face and I didnt hear her cry.
I saw the incident from a moving bus. I couldnt have saved her even if I managed to jump out. But such logic cannot dim the memory of horror and failure I carry with me. Now the horror is happening again. Another minority is being targeted. And we, the majority community in whose name the violence is being perpetrated, are failing to stop the marauders, to protect the victims or even to condemn the horror in loud enough voices.
What began in Teldeniya, what is happening all over Kandy, is not a religious clash. A clash implies two parties fighting each other, but in Teldeniya and in Kandy  as in Ampara last week - there are just armed perpetrators and unarmed victims. Nor was the violence that began in Teldeniya on the night of March 4th an accident. There was nothing spontaneous about the timing of the violence, and its trajectory.
On February 20, a minor traffic accident involving a three-wheeler and a lorry happened in Teldeniya. The incident ended in a brutal assault; the four passengers in the three-wheeler savagely attacked the lorry driver. The attackers were Muslims. The victim was Sinhalese, the sole breadwinner of his family. But there is no evidence whatsoever that the racial/religious identity of either party had anything to do with the assault. It was another expression of brutality pervasive in society, a legacy of the long war and two insurgencies.
The Sinhala victim was immediately hospitalised and the Muslim attackers were immediately arrested and remanded (they are still in remand). The police were not lax in performing their duties and no politician intervened to save the culprits. After almost two weeks in the ICU the lorry driver died on March 3. If the anti-Muslim riot in Teldeniya was a spontaneous explosion of anger, it should have happened either on the day of the assault or on the day the victim died. But up to the evening of March 4, Teldeniya didnt explode.
On the evening of March 4 Venerable Galagoda-Atte Gnanasara Thera visited the funeral house. A couple of hours later the first attacks began. Muslim properties were destroyed and burnt. Police intervened and arrested some rioters. If the government intervened at this point, ordering in additional forces or declaring a limited curfew, making it clear through fast and strict action, that further acts of mob-violence will not be tolerated, the subsequent tragedy could have been avoided. But the government did nothing, thereby leaving the field wide open to Sinhala-Buddhist extremists dreaming of a new Black July.
On the morning of the 5th, a baying mob surrounded the police station and demanded the release of arrested rioters. Venerable Galagoda-Atte Gnanasara Thera was there, playing the role of peacemaker, but in reality lending the mob the protection of his robe and his name. (One of the monks present, probably the controversial chief-incumbent of Mangalaramaya in Batticaloa, is heard promising the mob to get ape aya  our people  released in an hour. He also says he will summon a senior DIG for discussions if necessary, a statement which indicates the kind of power and impunity these robed criminals continue to enjoy, despite the governments pledges to end impunity and restore the rule of law.)
That afternoon, the second round of rioting began.
From Ampara to Teldeniya
The argument that the violence, be it in July 83 or today, is the work of a fanatical minority is true. But it is also irrelevant. The majority of Sinhalese did not take part in Black July. They didnt have to. All they had to do was to shrug a shoulder, turn a blind eye. Indifference is neither neutral nor benign. Indifference kills and destroys.
In 1983, the silence of the silent majority (together with the lenience of the government and the collusion of the police and the military) created the enabling environment in which a minority of extremists could set fire to an entire country. That collective indifference was fed by inherited myths and fake news about encroaching Tamils dominating our universities by cheating at exams, taking away our jobs and our land, planning to overrun our only country by breeding like rabbits... Ancient tales and false statistics were used to lend this demonization an air of sanctity, authenticity and objectiveness. Without that seeding Black July wouldnt have happened.
Those same lies are being repeated about Muslims now. The BBS started the madness in 2012, under the patronage of the Rajapaksas, pouring lurid stories into willing ears, turning Muslims into the next enemy, the new other. Without that seeding, Ampara and Teldeniya wouldnt have happened and Kandy couldnt be happening.
The mini-riot in Ampara was waged on the excuse of a sterilisation pill which a customer supposedly found in a curry (or a kottu) purchased from a Muslim-owned eatery. The Ministry of Health or the Minister of Health should have issued an immediate statement nailing the canard, explaining that no one in the world, no physician, no pharmaceutical company, no researcher has succeeded in manufacturing a sterilisation pill. The Ministry did make a statement, but almost a week later. By that time, the myth of the sterilisation pill had become an accepted fact in the larger society.
If the police was lax and the government was inept, society was no better. The professionals best able to nail the lie about a sterilisation pill, the doctors, were mostly silent. A few brave souls spoke out but the absolute majority said nothing. The various medical associations (including the GMOA) did not bother to explain the truth to the country. Their silence fed the fires of misunderstanding. More than a week later, they are still silent.
It is a dangerous path, allowing extremists to dominate the narrative and own the initiative. The danger becomes greater when leading extremists are granted de facto impunity on the strength of a hallowed robe. These old habits and practices were supposed to end in January 2015.
The Sirisena-Wickremesinghe administration was supposed to, expected to, end the impunity enjoyed by robed thugs, adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards every kind of extremism and ensure that another Aluthgama never happened.
The government, to its credit, is not racist. But during most of its tenure, especially the last two years, it has displayed a distressing absence of political and moral courage. Instead of standing up to every form of extremism, it developed a habit of succumbing to monks, priests and mullahs. The government did not create extremists. But it pandered to extremists in the hope of rendering extremism toothless. This political weakness and moral cowardice didnt render extremism toothless; on the contrary it helped turn the teeth into fangs. Muslims voted for the government in massive numbers, hoping for peace and security. The government failed them. Who can they trust now Will they ever feel secure, even after the fires have died How can they Why should they
Suicide at Seventy
Sri Lanka celebrated her 70th independence day just a month ago. In reality there is nothing much to celebrate. We are Sri Lankans in name only. Unity is just a word; coexistence a precarious state that can be destroyed by the most trivial of incidents. We are a country of Buddhists, Hindus, Christians and Muslims who know next to nothing about each others religions. Most of us study in schools which are de facto segregated, live in neighbourhoods with invisible walls.
A fog of misconceptions divides the ethnic and religious groups who call this island home. Comparative religion is not a subject taught in our schools. What we read in the media strengthen the prejudices we learn at home and relearn in school. Where ignorance and fear rule, violence is never far away. Anything can ignite it  a misplaced food order (as in Dambulla last year), the myth of a sterilisation pill, a brutal crime.
One of the tasks of the new government was to carry out a systematic effort to dent this fog of misconception. Even that task, which did not require standing up to mad monks, priests or mullahs, was not done. In the absence of any counters, lies continued to flourish. For example, a website called the Lanka C News recently carried a new item claiming that the proportion of Sinhala Buddhists which had been at 72% a few decades ago has come down to 67% now. The statistics were a total fake. According to census figures since the first census of 1881, Sinhala-Buddhists never exceeded the 70% mark until 2012. 2012 was the last census and according to that census Sinhala-Buddhists comprise of 70.1% of the populace.
So the news about a rapid decline in Sinhala-Buddhist numbers is fake news, a lie fabricated to make Sinhala-Buddhists feel insecure. More worryingly, the website attributes this incendiary canard to Hemakumara Nanayakkara, the governor of the Southern Province. The government might not know that it is nursing new Cyril Maththews in its midst, but that ignorance is no excuse, not when the fate of the country and lives of people are at stake.
If Kandy continues to burn, sooner rather than later, the contagion of anti-Muslim violence will spread to other areas, including Colombo. If that happens, Sri Lanka will not be able to escape the scourge of a religious war. Black July enabled the LTTE to gain the upper hand within the Tamil armed struggle. The triumph of violent Sinhala extremism in the South led to the triumph of violent Sinhala extremism in the North. Sri Lanka and all her people are yet to recover from the horror the competing extremisms unleashed.
Now we are about to recreate that historical crime with Muslims.
There can be no peace in a country where the extremists set the national agenda. Talking about the rule of law is a joke when robed thugs are above the law and can command senior DIGs. It is a dangerous game, allowing extremists to ply their deadly trade, irrespective of which race they belong to, which religion they espouse or which political party they claim to support.
As a multi-ethnic, multi-religious country, our greatest enemy is extremism. And of the competing extremisms, the most dangerous is the extremism of the majority community. When Sinhala-Buddhist fanatics are given a free hand, they set the country on fire, endanger innocent lives and strengthen fanatics in minority communities.
That is why a zero-tolerance policy towards extremism must be applied with equal vigour and firmness to monk, mullah and priest. The habit of allowing extremists to shape the national agenda and set the national course must end if Sri Lankas future is to be better than her past.
If the government is too timorous to do so, the demand and the pressure should from come from those Sinhala-Buddhists who retain enough sanity to see the deadliness of the future that is being made. Kandy was set in fire in our name.
The perpetrators want to turn Sri Lanka into the next Myanmar. If we remain silent and inactive, shame and guilt will be our lot once again. If we, the Sinhalese, fail Muslims as we failed Tamils, history will not forgive us, and will punish us with a new and a worse war.

Bill for protection against enforced disappearances passed without amendments
The Bill for the protection against enforced disappearances was passed without amendments in Parliament yesterday amidst disturbances from the Joint Opposition.
The Bill was passed with a majority of 37 votes, obtaining 53 votes in favour and 16 votes against following a division called by JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
The JO members voted against while the JVP members walked out of the chamber at the time of voting. A total of 156 members were absent.
Earlier in the day, Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana moving the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill for debate proposed to amend the Clause on extradition in the Bill for clarity that it does not apply to Sri Lankan citizens.
However, as the debate concluded the Joint Opposition opposed to moving the said amendment stating that they had not received a copy of the document for their perusal.
National Freedom Front Leader Wimal Weerawansa agitated in the House asking the Government to postpone the debate.
MPs Dinesh Gunawardena and JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti spoke on the same lines.
Intervening at this point, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told the House that the Government withdraws the said amendment and puts the Bill for vote without amendments.
Minister Marapana also observed that the amendment was proposed as per the JOs request and if it does not want it the Government would go ahead without it.
The minister said that he wished to include a phrase excluding Sri Lankans in Section 8 of the Bill to expel the doubts held by some that the legislation allows a foreign state to try a Sri Lankan, who is found to have committed an offense, in a court of law in that respective state. He made this statement when Joint Opposition members requested to postpone the debate on the Bill which had already been deferred twice in Parliament due to various objections.
Section 8 establishes that the Government of Sri Lanka will notify any State making an extradition request of the steps already taken or steps to be taken in respect of the prosecution or extradition of the person accused of offenses under the Act.
This was the only concern raised by JO MPs when the Bill was discussed at the Sectoral Oversight Committee. This amendment is redundant as this legislation does not anyway obligate us to extradite that person, but proposed it for clarity. What is mentioned in the International Convention is not the law of Sri Lanka and what becomes law here is what is mentioned in this Act, he clarified.
The minister pointed out nothing in the Bill is retrospective and its content applies only to the offences committed in the future. All the offences mentioned in this Bill are already considered offences according to the Penal Code and other laws in Sri Lanka.
Under Section 3 of the Bill, a person guilty of the offence of enforced disappearance can be imprisoned for a term not exceeding 20 years, and be liable to pay a fine not exceeding Rs 1million and compensation not less than Rs 500,000 to a victim, Minister Marapana said.
Sri Lankan Government ratified the UN International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances (ICPPED) in December 2015 and the bill is to satisfy its obligations under the ICPPED.
The main intention of the bill is to ensure that every Sri Lankan citizen gets the freedom to live without fear of being a victim of enforced disappearance or abduction.
The Second Reading of the Bill received 53 votes in favour and 19 votes against, and the number of votes against the Bill reduced further at the Third Reading vote.

Catholic Bishops Conference calls for restraint
The Catholic Bishops Conference in Sri Lanka in a statement yesterday appealed to all religious and political leaders and other organisations to cooperate in a spirit of dialogue and understanding to prevent a disastrous conflict.
It is destructive to give religious twists to isolated incidents, leaving room to extremists to create a conflageration, let no one add fuel to fire. Such acts will not protect the country, religions or race but rather insult, discredit and betray them, the statement said.
The Catholic Bishops Conference in Sri Lanka is deeply concerned about the disturbances which have arisen in the country during the past few days.
Considering that this country has a multi ethnic and multi religious co composition, we need to promote and foster harmony to live in peace.
As citizens of Sri Lanka, we ought to look at the prevailing situation and its consequences wisely and with foresight. Having learnt from our past experiences, we should look at all incidents as having potential to unleash violence. Therefore, let us be realistic, humane and compassionate in dealing with events of this nature. We do not need outsiders to teach us of the importance of living in peace and harmony; we have the four major religions to teach, us of the spiritual values.
Therefore, it is destructive to give a religious twist to isolated incidents, leaving room to extremists to crate a conflagration; let no one and fuel to fire. Such acts will not protect the country, religion or race but rather insult, discredit and betray them.
We earnestly request all religious and political leaders and other organisations to cooperate in a spirit of dialogue and understanding to prevent a disastrous conflict. We all realise that the path of reconciliation and harmony is an arduous process where patient commitment, and courageous dedication of every one is required in achieving it.
Towards this end, we the Catholic Bishops Conference in Sri Lanka seek the good will of every one to help restore order and peace while praying for Gods blessing upon our dear country, Rt. Rev. Dr. Winston Fernando, President, Catholic Bishops Conference in Sri Lanka and Rt. Rev.Dr.Valence Mendis, Secretary General, Catholic Bishops Conference in Sri Lanka said yesterday.

Church of Ceylon calls on the Govt to restore peace
Presiding Bishop of the Church of Ceylon Rt Rev. Dhiloraj Canagasabey in a statement yesterday called on the government to take urgent steps to bring a halt to the criminal activities taking place in several parts of the country.
The Bishop of Colombo also urged the government to take stern actions against those who are involved in thuggery and violence .
Those who suffered harm and damages must be compensated and minority groups reassured that they cannot be used as scapegoats and pushed to desperation, Rt Rev. Dhiloraj Canagasabey said.
The full statement:
Barely had the nation recovered from the aftermath of the local government election, its political fall out and the confusion created, that violence broke out in two areas, Amapara and Digana, where from all accounts, personal disputes have been deliberately twisted to inflame hatred and violence against minorities, in this case the Muslim community.
Both incidents demonstrate how fragile inter-communal and inter- religious harmony is in this country and how little it takes for matters to spin out of control. The ugly pictures of rampaging mobs brandishing rods and poles setting fire to property and vehicles recalls to us the frightening images of the many riots that have torn this country apart and the irreparable damage it has caused our nation.
Social harmony is the bedrock on which all else is built. It is foolish to imagine that anyone gains by this kind of mob violence. It is the responsibility of all religious, community leaders and politicians to speak and act to ensure that we maintain understanding and peace amongst communities despite our differences.
The slow reaction of the authorities to the violence and arson is greatly disappointing. If there
has been lethargy, inaction or collusion at any level these must be investigated. The primary duty of any government is to ensure the public peace and come down strongly on anyone who attempts to take the law into their own hands.
I call on the government to take urgent steps to bring an immediate halt to these criminal acts and to take stringent action against all those who use thuggery and violence and who incite them, including those who use social media for this purpose. Those who suffered harm and damages must be compensated and minority groups reassured that they cannot be used as scapegoats and pushed to desperation.

Emphasis made on wellbeing of Kidney and Women's Health
The World Kidney Day falls today (Thursday, March 08). This year is dedicated for Kidney and Women's Health, said Consultant in Medical Administration and the CEO / Director of the National Institute for Nephrology Dialysis and Transplantation Dr. Rathnasiri A. Hewage.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said that the entire country should pay special attention towards preventing and controlling kidney diseases on this day which is International Women's Day. Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology (CKDU) is another factor that distract people from CKD.
According to Dr. Hewage, only 25 percent of kidney patients in Sri Lanka has CKDU and all the other cases are CKD.
The main factors that contribute for CKD is diabetes and high blood pressure (hypertension).
Consultant in Chemical Pathology attached to the MRI Dr. Gaya Katulanda said that anybody can get done Serum Creatinine test and eGFR test in order to detect kidney diseases at an early stage.
The result of Serum Creatinine should be within the reference rage and eGFR should be less than 60. Urine Microalbumine to Creatinine ratio should be checked thrice within two weeks taking the urine sample in the early morning and should see a doctor if two out of three results become positive.
Consultant Nephrologist Dr. Anura Hewagiganage said that issues develop during pregnancy, joint diseases, congenital issues, urine infections etc. lead to the development of CKD.
Consultant Vascular and Transplant Surgeon Dr. Nalaka Gunawansa said that kidney transplantation can extend the life expectancy of a kidney patient and improve his/her quality of life.
Kidney can be taken for transplantation only if the patient die in an ICU and only when the heart is working. Even under those conditions, the kidney should be taken within six to eight hours. Some kidney patients live for 20 or 25 years after transplantation.

Everyone is an Ocean inside
Today, on Womens Day as government organizations celebrate the movement of womens rights, while social media overflows with good wishes for women, if you found yourself wondering and doubting if men can be feminists you need to get introduced to my father, Daya Dissanayake, or Khaled Hosseini, the author of the Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. Both have written advanced feminist literature focusing on the plight of women  and both regularly speak out against the oppression women suffer.
Fueled by the belief a society has no chance of success if its women are uneducated and realizing his debut work, The Kite Runner, had turned out to be a novel about men, even as he edited the manuscript of his first book, Hosseini had decided that in his second novel he would address the issues pertaining to women.
The result was A Thousand Splendid Suns. In this incredible chronicle of Afghan history, Hosseini gives readers an amazing look at what happens when women in Afghanistan are left to fend for themselves. The seeds for the story were planted in his mind he says in the spring of 2003 when he had gone to Afghanistan and met women who were working for various organizations. I basically just listened to their stories. The purpose of the visit was to educate myself. I really wasnt thinking at all about researching a book. But I came home with this amazing repertoire of eyewitness accounts and stories that were vivid and heartbreaking, and that sat in my head for about another year. When I began writing this novel, all those voices came back and I think the two main female characters in A Thousand Splendid Suns were kind of inspired by my collective sense of what women in Afghanistan went through, particularly since the withdrawal of the Soviets and the breakout of anarchy and extremism and criminality.
Writing from a female perceptive had not come easy. Hosseini remembers calling his agent and telling her what he was going to write, and listening to her say, It sounds pretty daunting. He admits he had not thought it would be hard  until he got into the thick of writing. Looking at the world through a womans eyes had not been easy. I thought I had really kind of cornered myself into a difficult spot, especially since I had set my heart on writing from two womens perspectives, two very different women. So it became very difficult, almost to the point where it kind of crippled the writing process, Hosseini confesses. I was agonizing over whether I was doing it right and obsessed with this notion that women live in a different emotional arena. At some point I just let go and I began to view these two women, not as Afghan women, but rather just people and focused on their humanity rather than their femininity. Suddenly a really transformative thing happened. These women began to speak for themselves, and I kind of became a mouthpiece for them rather than me speaking through them. The novel almost wrote itself after that.
In the same way Herman Melville scribbled changes onto the final proofs of Moby-Dick until the printers deadlines could wait no longer; and Virginia Woolf announced at least four separate times that she had finally completed The Waves, Hosseini too says he keeps writing and refining and finds it hard to stop working on a novel, even when everyone around him is screaming for him to stop.
The reason for this, he explains is that its terribly hard for a book to recreate the scope and grandeur of an authors ideas before they hit the page. Everyone is an ocean inside, he said in an interview with the Atlantic a few years ago. Every individual walking the street. Everyone is a universe of thoughts, and insights, and feelings. But every person is crippled in his or her own way by our inability to truly present ourselves to the world.
Explaining further he adds, we fear well be misunderstoodand, at times, we surely will be. The most powerful human emotions are terribly difficult to explain in a way that doesnt diminish them, or that doesnt make you look slightly ridiculous in the telling. How easy to safeguard them then, and keep things close, rather than risk looking foolish or being misheard.
But thats what art is forfor both reader and writer to overcome their respective limitations and encounter something true. It seems miraculous, doesnt it That somebody can articulate something clearly and beautifully that exists inside you, something shrouded in impenetrable fog. Great art reaches through the fog, towards this secret heartand it shows it to you, holds it before you. Its a revelatory, incredibly moving experience when this happens. You feel understood. You feel heard. Thats why we come to artwe feel less alone. We are less alone. You see, through art, that others have felt the way you haveand you feel better.
Born in Afghanistan on 4th March 1965 Hosseini and his family sought asylum in the US when he was 15 years old, with only a limited grasp of English. He went on to attend medical school and began practicing as a doctor in California. While still working as a physician, he began writing The Kite Runner,hoping to share what life in his homeland had been like. I expected the book to resonate with people who were interested in the region, who maybe were interested in Afghanistan specifically, he remembers.
But the degree to which it caught on  it did take me by surprise quite a bit.
But even after The Kite Runner, became an international publishing phenomenon in 2003 (6 million copies in print in the U.S. and 18 million worldwide), he still found it hard to imagine that his writing career would last. For a year and a half after its publication, I refused to believe that it was possible that I could do this for a living, says Hosseini. I was reluctant to let go of the security of a very stable life. But, he says, when I started seeing people at airports reading my book, and when my patients would come in to visit me, more out of a sense of getting a book signed than getting their diabetes treated, I started to see the writing on the wall. Thats when he gave up his profession and became a full -time writer. Theres no doubt he was wise to hang up his stethoscope.
As a self-taught writer, Hosseini believes writing runs in his blood. Both his parents are from Herat, where, he explains, The old joke is you cant stretch a leg without poking a poet in the rear. On his fathers side there were a number of accomplished poets known within the town, but never published. His younger brother Daoud is also a poet.
These days his wife, Roya, a Silicon Valley investment lawyer, is his most trusted editor. I will give her 10 to 15 pages to read and it will come back and there will be a red line circling a paragraph and it says, lol [laugh out loud] you cant be serious! I have people in my family who love me too much to ever say anything negative, they feel like they hurt my feelings. But evidently not Roya.
Some authors, among them John Irving, are notorious for not beginning a new work until its entire story has been carefully plotted. I envy the ability to do that, laughs Hosseini. But I cant do that. I never know where the book is going. As new characters emerge, they become, he says, like pebbles in a shoe, and I have to see what they are all about.
With an amused twinkle in his eyes, he also issues a warning. If you are going to be a character in my novel, get a lot of life insurance, he jokes. It is not going to be good for your health.

First six overs had a great  impact on the game - Kusal
Man of the match Kusal Perera said that the first six overs decided the fate of the first match in the Nidahas trophy T20 tri-series between Sri Lanka and India played at the R Premadasa Stadium on Tuesday.
Sri Lanka won that game quite handsomely by five wickets thanks to Pereras early onslaught on the Indian bowlers that saw his team run up their best ever power play T20I total of 75/2 in the first six overs. In comparison India managed only 40 in their power play overs.
When you get that kind of start it is easier for the innings to progress smoothly. But you dont get that kind of start every game. The first six overs had a great impact on the game, said Perera who went onto score a blazing 66 off 37 balls that saw Sri Lanka overhaul Indias total of 174-5 with nine balls to spare. The win brought to an end Sri Lankas seven-match T20I losing streak against India.
We had to attack in the first six overs as the target was 175. We needed some momentum, said Perera who was playing his first international match since January 21 after straining his side during the one-day tri-series match against Zimbabwe in Bangladesh.
After the injury when I returned there were doubts. More than wanting to play a great knock, I wanted to play a good game. Very happy with that. Ive had several injuries in the last several months. But I had played a few domestic games and I had done well. So I had confidence going into the first match of the competition. The way the wicket was behaving it was easy to bat. The ball was coming onto the bat that was why I was playing my normal game.
Perera whose strokeplay is sometimes reminiscent of the great Sanath Jayasuriya denied that he was trying to copy anyone. I was not trying to copy anyone but playing my normal game. When you have confidence and experience you know how to play your game. Some people use the top hand and some the bottom hand. I am using the bottom hand and everyone is different.
Perera said that his assault on fast bowler Shardul Thakur off whom he took 27 runs in an over was not pre-meditated. He bowled short and full and I was going to attack him after two balls. That is the T-20 game and you have to attack.
Perera said the win was a good confident booster for the tournament and they hoped to maintain it right till the end.
It is good for our confidence to start off with a win. That is the main thing. We are trying to improve everyday. We are not over confident. We are seeking to improve every single day, said Perera.
The Indian side is very good and they have done a good job in the last few months. We were trying to control what we can control. The coaching staff is communicating well. The players have been given confidence. The way everyone is moving about during games and training is good.
In his career Perera has batted in different positions from opener to middle order batsman. Whatever the position I get, I need to play a role. Whether I am opener or middle order batsman, it is decided by the selectors and the management. My role was to go out there and do the job for the team.
TODAY: Bangladesh the third team in the competition make their first appearance when they meet India at the R Premadasa Stadium at 7 pm.

India reclaims worlds fastest  growing economy tag from China
The Indian economy has regained its momentum, with the Central Statistical Office (CSO) reporting a GDP growth of 7.2% in the December quarter (Q3) of 2017-18the fastest in five quarters.
This recovery was sparked by a revival in investment demand, registering a growth of 12%.
Based on Q3 GDP data, the full years growth has been revised upwards to 6.6%. If this GDP growth rate is realized, the size of the Indian economy is projected to grow to $2.6 trillion at the end of March.
Not only does this signal that the Indian economy is tiding over the disruptionstriggered by demonetisation of high-value currencies and rollout of the goods and services taxbut the latest quarterly corporate earnings data suggest that consumer demand too is reviving.
To achieve the 6.6% growth projection of the second advanced estimate, the Indian economy will have to grow at 7.1% in the last quarter, as against a growth of 6.5% in Q2 and 5.7% in Q1.
The Indian economy had expanded by 7.1% in 2016-17, 8.2% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2014-15.
The CSO had in its January projections estimated that the economy will grow at 6.5% in 2017-18 but has now marginally revised it upwards, though it is still lower than the 6.75% estimated by the Economic Survey.
In the quarter, economic activity picked up across sectors, with the exception of mining and quarrying, data released by CSO showed.
Significantly, gross fixed capital formationan indicator of investment demand in the economyalso registered a sharp increase of 12%. Private final consumption expenditure grew at 5.6% while government final consumption expenditure was up at 6.1%.
To be sure, a part of the acceleration can be attributed to the base effect. India cancelled the legal tender of high value notes on 8 November 2016 leading to widespread disruption in economic activity.
Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings, said the Indian economy should grow gradually to 7.5% in 2018-19.
Manufacturing has benefited in the third quarter from the restocking exercise post demonetization which is also evident in the IIP growth numbers which should be maintained, he said in a note adding that the pickup in activity across sectors, supported by private consumption and gradual revival in investment could push India into the high growth trajectory.
In the quarter, agriculture grew at 4.1%, manufacturing at 8.1%, construction at 6.8%, trade, hotels, transport communication and services related to broadcasting at 9% and electricity, gas water supply & other utility services at 6.1%.
The finance ministry said in a statement that the robust growth in manufacturing and significant acceleration in construction mark a turnaround in the countrys economic growth momentum.
For the full year, gross value added (GVA) is expected to grow at 6.4% as against 7.1% in the year ago period. Agriculture will grow at 3%, manufacturing at 5.1%, trade, hotels and restaurants at 8.3% and construction at 4.3%.
But given that government spending has driven economic growth, the rising fiscal deficit numbers could prove to be a constraint.
Chandrajit Banerjee, director general, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said the Q3 GDP numbers strengthens the perception that the Indian economy is on the threshold of a sustained rebound.
Separately, data released by the controller general of accounts, Indias fiscal deficit as of January end was at 113.7% of the revised estimates.
