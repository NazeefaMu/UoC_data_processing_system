In favour of private university education
The following are only the best private medical colleges mentioned  there are many more private medical colleges around in the countries mentioned.
Best Private Medical Colleges in five countries bordering Sri Lanka
* Best Private Medical Colleges of Pakistan - 20 in number
* Best Private Medical Colleges in India 2015 - 30 in number
* Best Private Medical Colleges in Nepal - 10 in number
* Best Private Medical Colleges in Bangladesh 48 in number
* Best Private Medical Colleges in Sri Lanka - 0 (Nil)
This gives the picture very clearly.
Sri Lanka is the only country in the entire region without a recognized Private Medical College!
These private medical colleges are catering to a need, earning money  including Foreign Exchange, providing retired doctors with jobs, high salaries and have been enjoying the fruits of their labours. And producing excellent medical graduates. Also saving the country a large sum of money in Government financing these Medical Colleges, which they have been doing in Sri Lanka for the past 70 years.
But Sri Lanka is the only country which has not done this. Why, In 1956 the Sinhala Only Policy was brought in by S W R D Bandaranaike to win the election on the racist card, regardless of the consequences to the people, to education, to administration of government and to the Legal and Medical Profession.
The Bandaranaike Family of course ensured their own three children were educated in three top European universities  Oxford, London and the Sorbonne.
But for the hoi polloi and the riff raff it was Sinhala Only!
Trade union action
Subsequently Governments have not changed this disastrous policy but has continued to use it to gather extra votes at election time to stay in office. They raise this fear among the majority Sinhalese people periodically when they need support for counter-productive legislation, and a lot of other issues.
This has in turn produced a sub-standard education which is widespread in the country and has chased hundreds of thousands of bright students to leave the country for better pastures, never to return.
The vast remainder are mainly dregs of the student levels (Not all of them of course).
Now these GMOA supporters and their cohorts are trying to get the Government to take over the only Private Medical College in the island and convert it into their own messy style of functioning and behaviour patterns and control medical education in the country.
They have even got round the Retired Grama Sevaka (GCE qualified) with no proper understanding of the issues involved to judge this very important issue, threatening trade union action, blackmail, thuggery, cheating and every conceivable method to achieve their aims!
The Sinhala Only policy impoverished the country economically, and in the education fields so badly that there are no signs of recovery ever. The only solution is to have an English only education. China which has a large number of Private Medical Colleges teaches in English-Oxford English is what they opted for. While Sri Lanka which had a high level of Oxford English until 1956, has opted to destroy it. Why this death wish
Five private medical colleges
The people of this country have been kept in the dark by lying, and by blackmail, threats of Trade Union Action and so forth.
It is about time we bit the bullet and rectified this terrible situation for the students and the country before there will be no country left to govern, and we will be continually living on handouts.
Wake up Sri Lanka and serve justice, fairplay and results in your actions. Otherwise, you and all of us are doomed.
Dr Neville Fernando and his supporters are fighting an uphill battle. Hope they will succeed and that Sri Lanka will have another five private medical colleges shortly. Best of luck to them and to Sri Lanka.
As for the GMOA and their law-breaking followers, they should be taken into custody for action as criminals defying a Supreme Court Decision, and locked up in jail.
The GMOA and their fellow  travellers causing disruption are governed by massive jealousy of the success of the SAITIM programme.
They have to start thinking about the damage they are causing to the country.

FR filed by Udayanga Weeratunga re-fixed for support
The Fundamental Rights petition filed by former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga seeking an Interim Order to recall the warrant issued for his arrest by the Colombo Fort Magistrate was yesterday re-fixed for support on March 16 by the Supreme Court.
When the petition came up before the Supreme Court two-judge-bench comprised Justice Buwaneka Aluwihare, Upaly Abeyratne and Justice Anil Goonaratne, the Attorney General was given further time to seek possibility of releasing funds from several frozen bank accounts belonging to Udayanga Weeratunga following his request to do so.
On October 20 last year, the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued a warrant written in English through the Interpol for the arrest of UdayangaWeeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA).
Udayanga Weeratunga had filed this petition through his mother-in-law Latha Indrani, the power of attorney holder of the petitioner.
In his petition, Udayanga Weeratunga stated that he is currently residing in Mekhanizatoriv Street Kyiv,Ukraine.
The petitioner further sought an Interim Order restraining the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank from suspending the petitioners bank accounts and continuing to suspend the bank accounts.
The petitioner stated that the seventh respondent, a Chief Inspector of the FCID had moved Magistrates Court for a warrant for the arrest of the petitioner. The petitioner sought a declaration from the Court that the Chief Inspector infringed the petitioners Fundamental Rights guaranteed in terms of Articles 11, 12(1) and 13 of the constitution.
The petitioner further said the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank has infringed his Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the constitution by the purported decision to suspend and suspension of debit transaction of the bank accounts of the petitioner in contravention of the provisions of the Financial Transaction Reporting Act No. 6 of 2006.
In his complaint to the FCID, journalist Iqbal Athas stated that he had written several articles regarding the financial irregularities that had taken place in procuring four Mig-27 aircrafts at a higher price.
He told the police that these ground attack aircrafts had been manufactured between 1980 and 1983. He said financial irregularities had taken place during the transaction between Sri Lank and Ukraine.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for the petitioner. Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda appeared for the Attorney General.

Going for bigger catch
The topic of fish and the Palk Straits was one of six presentations by groups studying creative diplomacy at the Regional Centre for Strategic Studies Colombo. The writer was privy to presentations.
Globally more fish are harvested than meat. Sri Lanka has traditional fishing grounds. The prospects in the industry has enhanced with the reopening of EU markets and the growth of the post conflict Northern and Eastern grounds. A further incentive is the returning to profits of the Fisheries Cooperation after a sustained drought of losses.
Palk Strait is named after Robert Palk, governor of Madras presidency from 1755 to 1763 separating the Northern coast of Sri Lanka from the Southeast coast of India. Both countries have signed bilateral agreements on the maritime boundary as per the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS which became effective from 8 July 1974 followed by a supplementary agreement signed in 1976. (Both India and Sri Lanka have signed and ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which does not recognize maritime territory based on any historical claim).
The maritime boundary between the two countries was delineated in the Gulf of Mannar from the south-western edge of the Bay of Bengal to a point further down in a south-western axis up to the point where the boundaries of India, Sri Lanka and Maldives met in the Indian Ocean. Both countries enjoy sovereign rights over the waters, the islands, continental shelf and sub-soil of the maritime area on their respective side of the delineated boundary. Indian fishermen and pilgrims have also been permitted access to Kachhativu Island which falls on the Sri Lankan side of the maritime boundary.
The Indians mostly fish at night, with boats originating from Rameshwaram, Mandapam, Kottaipattinam, Jagadipattinam, Kodikkarai and Nagapattinamin coastal Tamilnadu. Moreover, their use of gill nets and synthetic nets has caused severe damage to the ordinary nets of Sri Lankan fishermen. They come in droves by night reaching a fever pitch towards 1am.
They outnumber their counterparts roughly a by a scale of 5:1. Sri Lankan Tamil fishermen could not freely fish during the last three years of the Fourth Eelam War (2006-09) due security restrictions, particularly on night fishing. Activities of the Indian fishermen allegedly increased as a result. Use of synthetic nets and the extended area of their operations seem to have adversely affected the livelihood fishermen families in Mannar, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Jaffna.
TamilNadus fishermen are not allowed to freely operate in the coastal waters of adjoining (Andhra Pradesh state. It is the same situation vis--vis Andhra fishermens conventional jurisdiction off the Orissa coast. Indian fisher folk normally observe such territorial limitations and there is no reason why they should not do so off Sri Lankan waters.
Solutions
Sri Lanka does not understand why it should restrict the number of days they fish on their side of the maritime boundary and why Indian fishermen have any right to fish in the first instance in Sri Lankan waters. Fish though are not constricted underwater by man made boundaries. In January this year, India and Sri Lanka held ministerial-level talks on their long-standing dispute over fishermen in the Palk Strait. Indian Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Radha Mohan Singh met with Sri Lankas Minister for Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Mahinda Amaraweera.
The Indian side agreed to encourage Indian fishermen to avoid the practice of bottom trawling  an unsustainable mode of fishing that indiscriminately captures aquatic life, leading to overfishing. The Indian External Affairs Ministry noted in its press release that bottom trawling would be phased out in a graded time-bound manner within a practicable timeframe.
Parliament is scheduled to debate two bills concerning the issue. One bill would increase fines for Indian fishermen caught fishing illegally in Sri Lankan waters and the other would ban mechanized bottom trawler.
There are calls to restrict the number of Indian trawlers that are allowed to operate beyond the maritime boundary, restrictions on the number of fishing craft and their technical capacity as well as the nature of the fishing nets used.
A Palk Bay Authority
An integrated solution to the fishermens problems encompassing their livelihood issues and commerce in the area has been proposed. In addition to New Delhi and Colombo, the government of Tamil Nadu and the Provincial Council of the Northern Province with fishing communities in both countries need to be involved.
A Palk Bay authority, comprising fisheries experts, marine ecologists, fishermens representatives, strategic specialists, and government officials from both governments. The authority could determine the ideal sustainable catch, type of fishing equipment that can be used, special provisions could be made to protect the interests of traditional fishermen and oversee pricing. The focus should be on the enrichment of marine resources and a qualitative improvement in the lives of coastal people.
A win-win
India has numerical superiority on fishing capacity. Sri Lanka has rich fishing grounds with potential to develop the industry further.
An agreement to nurture the fishing grounds, fish responsibly collectively on either side of the boundary with licensed craft, provide for fair sale of the catch in Sri Lanka whilst allowing sale in India, may bring dividends to all parties. It calls for cooperation across the Palk Straits on fishing. Hence from defensive postures moving to a common understanding to preserve means of livelihood and food, exploit the revenue earning potential responsibly from the industry, whilst respecting rights over the respective maritime zones would be a mature way of going forward.

Good Governance will overcome any obstacle: Rajitha
A deadly battalion is interrupting the ongoing programmes of the Good Governance Government and we will defeat them step by step, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Senaratne, the journey is not a red carpet ride and the difficult part is continuing the revolution. The Ministers in the current Government should understand this. The politicians make laws and the people should obey and follow such laws. When Parliament makes laws, the judiciary should implement them. During the previous regime, the rule of law was implemented according to political powers.
The minister made these remarks during the opening of the new building complex of the Warakapola base hospital.
The Minister pointed out that the new building complex constructed jointly by the Japanese Government and Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council is estimated at Rs. 1.1 billion. President Maithripala Sirisena obtained the grant during his tenure as the Health Minister.
He also obtained funds to build drug manufacturing plants of the State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC).
Senaratne said the people were fed up of changing political parties and it was why the National Government was formed. Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma and Chief representative of JAICA, Sri Lanka, Kiyoshi Amada were also present.

Govt. to approve setting up of National Council on Women
As the government faces tough questions at the 66th session of the Committee on the Convention on Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) this week, Cabinet has taken steps to simultaneously approve the setting up of the National Commission on Women- decades after it was first proposed by CEDAW.
The government in the late 90s established the National Committee on Women as per the Womens Charter based on CEDAW but it did not give it legal, administrative and financial authority to ensure that the state machinery implemented the rights of women as CEDAW had recommended. The Cabinet paper presented by Minister of Women and Child Affairs, Chandrani Bandara observed that an earlier Bill in January 2012 had been drafted to establish a commission but the Ministry of Finance and Planning at the time stated that, as a strong administrative and legal framework is in effect in Sri Lanka for the empowerment of women and for the protection of the rights of women, there is no requirement for the establishment of a National Commission on Women and that it would be appropriate to strengthen the legal framework and the institutions which are confronted with difficult situations
The institutions such as the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs, Sri Lanka Womens Bureau and the National Committee on Women which were the institutions with the mandate, however have no legal power to investigate or institute legal proceedings.
The government has not fared well at the present CEDAW Committee review with experts in Geneva questioning: the governments slow progress in prosecuting cases of sexual violence perpetrated by the armed forces against women during and after the conflict, its delays in tackling the issue of gender based violence in homes, the need to expedite cases of sexual and gender based violence in courts, to review discriminatory provisions in personal laws and to amend the Land Ordinance to allow women to have access to resources.

He was addressing a meeting following the inauguration of a number of development projects in Bentota Divisional Secretariat area in Galle recently.
Developed Deddugoda Circular Road in Kuda Uragaha, Achariwatte Road in Ranthotuwila Grama Niladhari division, Pilekumbura Multi-Purpose Building complex and Munasinghegama Water Supply Project were among the projects vested in the public by the minister.
He said the National Unity Government could restore a transparent and enhance the image of the country by rectifying diplomatic follies of the previous regime.
"We decided to continue with the new two party unity government until 2020. We could establish a new political culture of unity and conscience in place of conflicting politics winning the trust from the international community by restoring a transparent and civilized rule in the country.
During the previous rule, the media freedom was tumbled down. Abductions and killings of persons were a common phenomena. We were deprived of many international concessions, including GSP plus. However, we were able win the trust and confidence of the world community by restoring good governance in the country Karunathilake said.

Grama Seva divisions recive 500,000 for economic upliftment
The Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs will allocate Rs. 500,000 for each Grama Seva division to uplift the economy within each division, United National Party (UNP) Puttalam District MP Hector Appuhamy said at a media briefing at Sirikotha yesterday.
Referring to the allegations against former Minister Wimal Weerawansa, he said Weerawansa was allegedly involved in constructing low quality houses for health labourers in Chilaw but Rs. 945,000 had been recovered from labourers wages as the cost of construction.
Appuhamy said tourism and industrial zones would be established island wide and Colombo would be further developed as the financial city. The Swashakthi loan scheme will be implemented to provide financial assistance to small scale domestic industries, he added. He said all measures would be taken to re-establish the national unity of the country.
Meanwhile, UNP Kurunegala District MP Thushara Indunil Amarasena said the Joint Opposition (JO) Members double talk on the SAITM incident confirmed that their main motive was not to lead the country towards development but to regain power and safeguard their own interests.
There is nothing wrong in obtaining loans to finance the country. But, what matters is whether the obtained loans are utilised efficiently and effectively to lead the country towards sustainable development.
Therefore, the loans obtained by the previous regime were a complete waste since they were not allocated for any viable project, said Amarasena. He said the Executive Presidency would be abolished and a new Constitution introduced as per the promises given to the public by the Good Governance regime.

Great career opportunities from SriLankan Aviation College
SriLankan Aviation College has expanded its portfolio of products and services in recent months and is keen on communicating these lucrative career avenues to prospective aviation students.
In a news briefing on Wednesday insight into the Aviation College and its wide array of facilities were discussed and displayed. The event provided a unique opportunity to experience first-hand the high quality aviation training facilities and practical training opportunities available at SriLankan Aviation College, while simultaneously enhancing knowledge on advances in the aviation sector.
Since its inception in 2012, SriLankan Aviation College has forayed into many avenues, expanding its branch network and product portfolio. SriLankan Technical Training, which is part of the College, has undergone major developments in recent months to position itself as the prime aviation training institute in the country. For many years SriLankan Technical Training provided services for the national carrier and offered EASA 147 certified training programmes to both local and overseas students. However, its portfolio has now been extended to include EASA B1.1, B2 programmes to CAT A1 and foundation programmes. The technical institute has witnessed a steady flow of foreign students as well. Keeping abreast with counterparts abroad, the institute has introduced value additions such as internships and practical training opportunities for the students of SriLankan Aviation College.
SriLankan Aviation College (SLAC) from its' inception strengthened by the affiliations of world's foremost aviation institutions. International Air Transport Association (IATA) recognized SLAC as its' Regional Training Partner (RTP) in Asia and one of the top ten training centers in the world. European Aviation Safety Agency's (EASA) relationship with SriLankan exceeds more than ten years as South Asia's foremost EASA 147 approved training center.
Latest in our accolade International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) recognized us as their TrainAir Plus member, commission to provide ICAO training programs. SLAC is also among only a handful of aviation training organizations worldwide and the first in the country to obtain ISO 29990:2010 certification which is granted for learning services in the areas of Vocational Training, Life-Long learning and in-company training , plus ISO 9001:2015 as an organization which maintains management systems to provide consistent products and services that meet the customer requirements and satisfy regulatory requirements.
In addition to these international affiliations SLAC has strong bonds with state universities in Sri Lanka. University of Colombo, University of Moratuwa already joined hands with SLAC to offer co-branded programs in travel and Tourism sector.
Apart from these notable developments, SriLankan Aviation College is expanding its wings to new training areas such as national aviation diploma programmes, partnerships with universities and offering degree pathways, all of which bodes well for the country's aviation sector.
The rising popularity of Sri Lanka as an investment and tourism destination is generating a demand for technically skilled aviation personnel and SriLankan Aviation College is ideally poised to nurture and educate a new breed of specialised and technically advanced qualified aviation graduates to enhance the sector's future potential, while enhancing the sector's role in the economy.
The institute is cognizant of global standards and enables customized training solutions for international airlines and individuals. MFJ

Gulf Air commences direct flights between Colombo and Bahrain
The Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the Kingdom of Bahrain, Dr A. Saj U. Mendis, had a meeting with the Chief Executive Officer of Gulf Air Maher Salman Al Musallam, last week, to discuss the most efficacious courses of action as well as strategies to augment and to boost tourism in particular and other commercial, economic, investment and trade activities between the two countries.
The Gulf Air, the flagship carrier of the Kingdom of Bahrain, operates five direct flights between Colombo and the Kingdom of Bahrain, thus complementing the flights of Sri Lankan Airlines as well.
The Chief Executive Officer, Al Musallam, and Ambassador Dr Mendis, during the meeting, discussed a myriad of issues ranging from tourism, economic activity including trade and investments, connectivity between and among nations, geo-political and geo-economic dynamics and developments and people to people contact, among others.
It is of firm conviction of both the CEO and the Ambassador that the operation of Gulf Air to Sri Lanka would markedly enhance not only tourism from the Kingdom of Bahrain to Sri Lanka, but also other concomitant economic and investment activity, thus benefiting both the countries. The Gulf Air has placed firm orders for state of the art aircraft and it currently operates 30 aircraft serving over 40 destinations around the world. In year 2015, the tourism from the Kingdom of Bahrain to Sri Lanka was merely 3,000 and last year, the tourism from Bahrain to Sri Lanka has risen to approximately over 10,000. It is strongly envisaged that this year the tourism to Sri Lanka from the Kingdom of Bahrain would reach nearly 16,000 to 18,000, particularly given the fact that Sri Lankan Airlines has almost daily direct flights as well as the direct flights of Gulf Air.
The Chief Executive Officer, Al Musallam stated to Ambassador Dr Mendis that a large number of travel agents and tour operators as well as potential vacationers in Bahrain are keen to travel to Sri Lanka since it offers almost all touristic attractions of any given country. In addition, given the current political milieu and environment in the world, Sri Lanka is very stable and very safe for any foreigner or tourist to travel to almost any location in Sri Lanka.
Ambassador Dr Mendis punctuated the fact that a number of reputed international journals and magazines such as National Geographic and Lonely Planet have listed Sri Lanka as one of the most favored and desired touristic destinations in the world. Ambassador Dr Mendis also stated to the CEO Al Musallam that Sri Lanka Tourism (SLT) is hoping to host a mega Road Show to promote tourism from the Kingdom of Bahrain to Sri Lanka in the foreseeable future. He also added that Sri Lanka received well over two million tourists last year and it is the third largest foreign exchange earner of the country behind the remittances of migrant workers and garment sector.

Hallmark of the present moment
What is happening What would happen next Where are we heading for
These are questions that crop up today even during a casual conversation among friends and acquaintances. A certain uncertainty is in the atmosphere. Of course it is related to the Government and political developments of the day. The clarity and coherence in the objectives and actions of governance displayed at the time of taking over the reins of government are disappearing.
Our attempt here is to enumerate a few instances of such uncertainty that have become major concerns of the public. First and foremost is the fate of Constitutional changes. Going by media reports and utterances of several ministers and political parties in the Government there is no unified view on the matter.
The SLFP has decided to retain the executive presidency and not to go beyond the 13th Amendment in devolving power. Nay, it wants to abolish certain provisions in the 13th Amendment such as police and land powers granted to the Provincial Councils. Even ministers who are for devolution of power are practically taking over powers and institutions of the Provincial Councils under the central government. It was quite recently the Health Minister declared his intention to take over all base hospitals under the central government. Some of the better provincial roads and schools were taken over similarly during a former regime.
Though the President has not so far indicated any change in the electoral promises made loud mouthed ministers with a history of controversy such as S B Dissanayake as well as new-comers such as his namesake holding the post of General Secretary of the SLFP are implicating the President too in their statements. For instance, they have openly declared that the President would contest the next Presidential election though he has pledged to retire after the current term. Incidentally in opposing a new Constitution the language used by these gentlemen is the same as that used by the chauvinist forces opposed to national unity which gives rise to a justified suspicion whether they are acting as a Fifth Column of the so-called Joint Opposition.
New Constitution
Meanwhile spokesmen of the UNP say that a new Constitution will be introduced, as promised during the elections. Adding insult to injury there is no certainty about the promises made at the elections too. The irony of the situation is that those who opposed President Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe at the election are now interpreting their election manifestos. One could only say that the devil may quote scriptures to his purpose.
There is also a lot of uncertainty regarding the SAITM issue and the governments policy on free education. Minister of Higher Education Lakshman Kiriella and once again our friend former Higher Education Minister S B Dissanayake has taken up the position that the Court verdict is final. They belligerently oppose any other way out ignoring the sentiments of almost the entire University student body and a substantial number of academics and professionals. Meanwhile several political parties including some in the Government take a different position.
Differences of opinion are apparent in the sphere of foreign policy too. Doubts have arisen among concerned circles whether Sri Lanka is deviating from the non-aligned foreign policy. The lukewarm attitude shown towards it at the last Summit and the downgrading of our representation to it is a sign of such deviation, it is argued. The President, on the other hand has tried to allay these fears. Though the President and the Prime Minister have been visiting few dozen countries there has been no visit to the Gulf region where substantial number of Sri Lankans are employed.
Former regime
Uncertainty also relates to the fate of the investigations and legal proceedings against bigwigs of the former regime who were alleged to be involved in bribery, corruption and misuse of public property. No serious attempt has been made to expedite these inquiries or to ensure that undue influence is not being brought on officers of State conducting them. Some of the alleged offenders have not been touched at all despite wide accusations against them giving the impression that they are enjoying some sort of impunity.
Added to the confusion is the attitude of certain ministers to the FCID, which has been constituted legally. Their attitude does not differ in any way from that of many who are indicted in Courts for misdeeds while in public office. Is it a case of birds of a feather flocking together
There is hardly any attempt to formulate national policies on education, health etc. as envisaged in the Memorandum of Understanding reached by the UNP and the SLFP in forming the Consensus Government. What is witnessed is the same old acrimony among considerable segments of the two parties.
Uncertainty has given rise to confusion and loss of confidence in the Government on the part of the public including those who voted it into power. Confusion is a breeding ground for indiscipline. Hence, uncertainty, confusion and indiscipline seem to be the hallmarks of the present moment. The sooner they are eradicated the better for the country.

Innocent military personnel will not be punished: President on firm stance
President Maithripala Sirisena is on a firm stance that innocent military personnel should not be punished. He was also of the view that those who had committed offences should be dealt with, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
Minister Amaraweera made this observation yesterday in Parliament responding to NFF leader and Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa.
We know over 99.99 percent of the military officers had acted in keeping with the law, said Minister Amaraweera. But if there had been anyone who acted outside the law and assaulted or murdered media personnel or anyone else, they should be dealt with by law.
He said the public too would not stand against such a decision. Even the international community is on alert on such matters. However, we are now pressure-free due to the new governments policy in guaranteeing the rights of all communities equally, the Minister said. We have to take corrective measures building on the mistakes of the previous government.
He said unity between the Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims should be strengthened. However, the statements of several Tamil politicians in the North, especially in the Local Government institutions are hurting the sentiments of the Sinhalese community to a degree that discourage us to urge the Sinhalese community to build friendships, the Minister said.
He said the government would not be able to prevent the Police from preventing the method of their investigations such as taking data from communication towers in connection with the Keith Noyahrs investigation.
However, we guarantee that steps would taken against army personnel being harassed baselessly, Minister said.

Since the early 90s iOM has been in a league of their own when it came to (software) post implementation support.
iOM used what was then known as a Customer Service Reporting (CSR) module to log customer requests, questions or issues. This was at a time when none of the tier one ERP solutions carried a solution such as this.
In the year 2000, the second generation of this solution evolved as iOMHelp (www.iomhelp.com) which was a 24x7 web based helpdesk that allowed any of iOMs customers worldwide to access customer support. Today iOMHelp has evolved into being a mobile APP in keeping with the latest technology and user experience.
Once a request is logged in either via the APP or the website, it is routed to the appropriate engineer in the support team based on the closest regional support desk. The system also enables customers to track the status of a query and also allows iOM to analyse the type of query and solutions.
Therefore, apps are becoming the dominant form of digital interaction. Business users in today's world are onthe move and using mobile application platforms to get there. Whether they use mobile phones, tabletsor other smart mobile devices - they have all the information they need. That's why mobile Apps are so important as well as relevant in today's business environment.

Japanese Romeo Watanabe seeks Tokyo gold -- and more
TOKYO THURSDAY: Fresh from setting a new world record, Japans latest swim sensation Ippei Watanabe is plotting Tokyo Olympic glory in 2020 -- and he wants his gold medal sealed with a kiss.
The 19-year-old, who shot to fame with a jaw-dropping time of 2 minutes 06.67 seconds in the mens 200 metres breaststroke last month, plans to set another world best in the Olympic final and celebrate by sweeping some lucky damsel off her feet with a dashing wedding proposal.
Im blessed that Ill be at my peak as a swimmer when the Tokyo Olympics arrive, Watanabe told AFP in an interview.
My aim is to win the final in a world record and then propose to someone with my gold medal, he added, coyly declining to elaborate on who might be the object of his desire.
Theres only three years to go and Im determined not to waste the opportunity to make the Tokyo Olympics the crowning glory of my career. Behind Watanabes hopes for a slushy Hollywood ending, burns a competitive fire to emulate boyhood idol Kosuke Kitajima, who won 100m and 200m breaststroke gold at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics.
When I was 10 I buried a time capsule, said the Waseda University student, who broke the world mark in Tokyo watched by the Japan swimming great.
I put in a message with my dreams written on it: saying I wanted to be like Kosuke Kitajima and swim at the Olympics. Having eclipsed a world best once owned by Kitajima and competing in Rio last summer, Watanabe has gone some way to reaching those goals.
But the record-breaker, who finished sixth in the Olympic final, is hungry to prove his wonder swim was no fluke. AFP

## Title: Modular housing: Making housing affordable

Modular housing: Making housing affordable
Shelter, food and clothing are some of the most basic needs of all human beings but data from the Population and Housing Census of 2012 show that close to 3,418 families are homeless in Sri Lanka.
Adding to these numbers, the Ministry of Resettlement, Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms as of August 2016 states that three decades of war has left 13,670 internally displaced people who need to be resettled.
Housing thus is a major challenge as well as a need at present but due to high construction costs and time taken to build a house, many have been left homeless, despite the government promising one of the most ambitious housing projects since the late 80s.
On the other hand, plans such as the Megapolis and increased urbanization will also bring with it consequences such as unaffordable housing, rendering those on the margins of the housing market, homeless.
It is amidst such problems that the option of pre-fabricated homes have been proposed and while there are many models to be followed, a recent presentation done by Dr. Samudra Jayasekera, former National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) civil engineer and present Research Director at Modular Building systems based in Australia, has proposed the concept of modular housing.
She promises that this system would make housing affordable if done right, thus we first must understand why it is important to have a home within the reach of all.
The need to keep housing affordable
If the government ensures that all have access to a home, it will succeed in putting a stop to one of the biggest challenges any government faces; that is to put a stop to an increase in the informal housing sector. If people can afford a decent house, they are less likely to opt for a shanty.
According to the Habitat III-Sri Lanka National Report 2016, most low-income households are not bankable, and cannot afford access to formal housing finance. The banks classify about 80% of the nations earners as low income. Only 20% of all low-income earners have regular employment, potentially allowing them access to bank loans for finished housing.
This has led to the government proposing the plan of Affordable Housing for All by 2020 to develop a functioning housing market that meets the need of all segments of the population. They target to increase the supply of adequate housing to 100,000 units a year (including the improvement of existing stock) to address the backlog and ensure adequate and affordable housing for all.
A substantial share of these annual new buildings, possibly around 4045% in the initial years and then an even larger proportion, will be in urban areas. But meeting this target will be challenging given past trends. For example, each of the two largest municipalities  Colombo and Kandy approves 1,000 building permits a year on average, and Galle 500, according to the 2016 Habitat report.
However, the Habitat report also pointed out that for this to work, it was important to have the removal of, constraints on the supply of land and housing finance that limit the production of formal housing by the private sector and that keep formal shelter beyond the reach of most of the urban population. The needs of the poorest people must also be met, through well targeted housing assistance programmes (for example, credit enhancement for affordable housing and home improvements).
A survey carried out by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) in 2011 around Colombo estimated that 68,812 households lived in 1,499 underserved settlements, accounting for more than half the citys population. These settlements tend to be small and scattered, and about 74% of them have less than 50 housing units.
The results also showed that even cities outside of Colombo are faced with the challenge of underserved settlements.
In Matara, 17% of the housing stock was deemed to be unsanitary, due to the use of low quality material and unsafe locations. In Kandy, 18% of the population lived in 3,602 low-income housing units in 45 underserved settlements. Nuwara Eliya had more than 7,000 temporary houses constructed with non-permanent materials, equivalent to about 20% of the total housing stock. The suburban cities of Colombo, such as Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia, Kollonnawa, Kotte, Moratuwa, and Wattala, have on average 1015% of their urban housing stock at substandard quality.
Pre- fabricated Modular housing
It is in this backdrop that we come to the concept of modular housing. The former NBRO engineer who has worked in Australia for the past few decades has returned home to propose that the NBRO take on the idea of pre- fabricated modular housing as a possible option to solve the housing crisis in Sri Lanka.
Most believe that a house is a lifetime investment, and many will only finish construction on their house when they reach the last stages of their life. It is their biggest asset and greatest life investment, said Dr. Jayasekera presenting her plan to the NBRO.
Conventional housing however is also rigid and cannot be expanded. Modular pre-fabricated housing on the other hand can evolve during a lifetime, she added.
The pre-fabricated houses are built in sections in a factory controlled environment, and she explained that site work could be started while the components are being built. The ability to build a house at a much quicker pace than traditional construction has been one of the major selling points of modular housing.
Short timelines and reduction in overall project costs are one of the main advantages. We can also build permanent modular buildings to the same building codes as traditional buildings, said Dr. Jayasekera.
She estimated that it would take around 6.5 man-days to build a single unit with a 2,000 sq ft house which would traditionally cost AUD 3.2 million would cost AUD 1.5 million in modular form.
A significantly streamlined construction process, earlier occupancy due to a shorter construction timeline and reduced environmental impact and various Green Building optionswere some of the other advantages of choosing a modular house.
These are not shanties but houses providing all facilities needed for a person to live in, Jayasekera said. She also added that contrary to popular belief that all pre-fabricated houses would look like match boxes in a row, the houses provided the owner with the flexibility to meet any design specifications and be customized according to the needs of the environment. It is available as a small single story building to large multi-story complexes.
This is not the first time pre-fabricated houses have been proposed. Minister of Resettlement, Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms, D.M. Swaminathan too brought forward the idea of steel pre-fabricated houses in 2015 as a quick and easy way to build houses for IDPs in the North.
The initial project of 65,000 houses from Arcelor Mittal which was to cost an estimated US$ 1 billion faced much resistance due to the expense as well as the use of steel to build a house in the scorching heat of the North. Each house which was estimated to be built at around Rs 2.1 million however, was later brought down to Rs 1.6 million.
When Dr. Jayasekera was asked whether her own modular homes would be cheaper than steel fabricated ones, she replied in the affirmative, as steel was a much more expensive building material. It also usually costs less than half of that of a traditional model house, she said. The modular houses which have also been tested for extreme heat conditions in Australia would also be more suitable for conditions in the North.
Green Building
Furthermore, as energy efficiency and reducing environmental harm becomes a key consideration and Sri Lanka looks to meet its climate change goals, modular housing has sought to incorporate such considerations into its building specifications.
Hence the introduction of Smart Panel Technology that incorporate; Smart Wall Panels, Smart Floors, Smart Ceilings, Smart Roofs and Smart Structural Connections.
According to Dr. Jayasekeras presentation, smart walls were the next generation of structural insulated panels (SIP) which were constructed using a superior outer membrane made of composite materials. The walls also have inbuilt memory and will generally return to its original format if damaged.
The structure has also been tested for extreme seismic, cyclone, hurricane and landslide areas. Allowing it to withstand most natural disasters. In addition, it is not susceptible to decay, insects or termite attack and impervious to most acids and solvents.
The walls themselves are also light and can be manually handled. Dr. Jayasekera also noted that it is not only housing but also hospitals and large apartment complexes could be built using the same model.
The model though attractive has one flaw. It will only make economic sense if the units are built at a local factory, otherwise the added costs of transport would not guarantee the promised cost savings.
We need to set up a local factory and produce houses on a mass scale to make economic sense, quipped Dr Jayasekera who has proposed a partnership with the NBRO for such a venture.
At present her Australian company has set up a factory in Thailand where the need for modular housing has risen sharply over the years.
If we start a manufacturing plant here, we can also create new jobs and skill sets locally. It requires a significant investment but in the long term, it is very cost effective," she said.
Smart floor and ceilingSmart Floor & Ceiling take a holistic approach to building design and construction, working in conjunction with Smart Wall to form a practical solution that results in superior insulation and strength. Floor and ceiling panels can be manufactured from 2.4 m to 3 m wide and up to a 6 m span to allow quick manual construction. For a span of more than 6 m a supporting crane is needed to install. The same smart connection type is used to join the walls, floor and ceiling resulting in less fixtures and fittings (one connection type fits all). Once locked into position this transforms the building into a solid cube, fully insulated and extremely strong. The Smart Floor base is manufactured from roll formed light weight steel with Smart Floor attached, creating an extremely strong floor, soft underfoot and able to accept most floor covering including ceramic tiles. Smart Wall can be used in traditional situations and fixed directly to concrete or timber floors and a roof system pitched directly to the walls or can be used in conjunction with Smart Floor & Ceiling.
Smart wall panel specsSmart Wall can be manufactured in lengths to suit individual building layouts and in any length (up to 12 meters due to transportation limitations if it requires transportation). The height of a single panel can be manufactured between 2.4 m up to 3 meters. Lengths of 6 meters are generally considered the optimum size for safe manual handling. Above 6 m the support of a crane in needed. The outer membrane is manufactured in 106 meter rolls for maximum panel length laminated to the core substrate. Smart Walls superior construction allows it to span a far greater distance than standard Structural Insulated Panels (SIP), while requiring less support and with a greater load capacity. Wall joints are rendered invisible as the connections are located in junctions or intersections within the construction. The Primary material composition for the panels include EVA (Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA),closed cell high density foam core with either phenolic FRP or epoxy FRP (Fibre-reinforced plastic) (fibreglass) structural surface skins. The perimeters of each panel beingframed with Extruded PVC frames incorporating the panel to panel connections enabling the buildings to be assembled with no individual mechanical connections. All connections are continuous accommodating the in plane and out of plane flexural resistance, diaphragm and cracking resistance and waterproofing. The material composition combined with the connection system makes the system ideal for extreme wind conditions including impact and seismic conditions.
Smart connectionsSpecially extruded connections are exclusive to our Smart Wall system. The same smart connection type is used to join the walls, floor and ceiling resulting in less fixtures and fittings. Snap the panels into place to create a secure watertight connection. A connection that is extremely difficult to take apart without the use of mechanical tools. The connection runs the entire length of the panels. The result is the formation of a cubic structure that offers strength and rigidity that traditional Structural Integrity Panels (SIP) cannot achieve.

MR calls on President to condemn CBK
Incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena should condemn former President Chandrika Bandaranaikes allegations publicly that war widows face sexual exploitation by members of the army among others, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in a statement said yesterday.
The former President in his statement said her allegations against the Sri Lanka Army is a matter of grave concern.
When a former President and Commander-in-Chief makes such a statement, the person who should respond should be the current President and the Commander-in-Chief. Therefore, as a former President and Commander-in-Chief, I urge the President to publicly condemn the statement made by Kumaratunga, he said.
He said the government should seriously consider whether former President Kumaratunga is fit to be the head of the officie for National Unity and Reconciliation as she is using her position to tarnish the image of armed forces.
Since Kumaratunga holds the position of head of the ONUR which functions under the Presidential Secretariat, the statements she makes goes to the world as the official position of the Sri Lankan government, he said.
Now, with days to go for the 34th Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council, a former President of Sri Lanka and a former Commander in Chief of our armed forces says that our armed forces are sexually exploiting war widows in the north.
What we have here is a former President echoing the accusations made by our enemies in what is obviously a deliberate attempt to vilify our armed forces on the eve of the UNHRC meeting, he said.

Mustapha to mediate in LG, UDA issue
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha said he will seek a solution to the crisis pertaining to UDAs initiatives to restructure its powers delegated to local authorities.
I would like to play a role where I could put both parties together, said the Minister speaking to the Daily News. He said the Provincial Councils complain that the powers have been taken away by the UDA and the UDA claim they have a right to do so.
At this point I will not express my personal views being the bridge between the periphery and the centre. I believe that I can solve this through cordial discussions, he said. The Minister said he had discussions with the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry.
I am having a forum on March 27 where all Chief Ministers will participate and I hope to discuss this issue in full. Under this government there is nothing that cannot be solved through discussions, he said.

NFF cannot be accepted as one independent party: PM
The National Freedom Front (NFF) led by MP Wimal Weerawansa cannot be accepted as an independent party in Parliament. However, the five members could be accepted as five independent members in the Opposition, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
The Premier thanked and appreciated Weerawansa for deciding that they could not go forward under the leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He made this observation yesterday when MP Weerawansa demanded to know the decision of the Speaker on his request to accept the NFF as an independent party in the Opposition.
Reminding of the request made on Wednesday to allow five members of the National Freedom Front to function as an independent group, MP Weerawansa said he originally made the request from the Speaker on April 5, 2016. He added that in the same request, he said the NFF would act as an independent group. He added that he did not express his decision to be independent on April 5 last year and not on last Wednesday.
At this stage, the Premier said the NFF MPs can sit independently individually and not as a party.
He said he is grateful that Weerawansa had decided to be independent as it means that they can no longer work with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
MP Weerawansa said his party will continue to work with the joint opposition although it has decided to leave the UPFA.
Opposition MP Gajadeera said he is an MP from the Communist Party. He added that he decided to become independent even before the joint opposition was formed. He added that it would be appropriate if the Speaker allows members belonging to various political parties to act independently.
The Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said the usual procedure of the Parliament is that only the parties from which a member has contested the election from are accepted as a party which represents the House. He added that if MP Weerawansa says he would act along with former President Rajapaksa, he had not deviated from the norm.
The Speaker said he will give a ruling after speaking to all relevant political parties.

NFF never a part of UPFA: Dayasiri
The National Freedom Front (NFF) of MP Wimal Weerawansa was never a part of the UPFA, said SLFP MP and Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday as he explained that the Alliance had no agreement with the party.
Addressing a media briefing at SLFP Headquarters on Darley Road, the minister explained that only three main parties had official agreements with the UPFA. They were the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) of Dinesh Gunawardena, Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) with Armugam Thondaman and the Desha Vimukthi Janatha Party.
They cannot leave the UPFA if they were never a part of it, stressed Jayasekara and added that the five members of NFF simply contested as independent UPFA candidates and not as a separate party.
If they are to be independent, they have to do what UPFA MP Chandrasiri Gajadeera did; be an independent UPFA MP within Parliament and not as a separate party, he explained.
According to Jayasekara, Weerawansa had taken such a decision as he was not being given due prominence to speak in Parliament as a party leader under Parliamentary Standing Orders 23/2. We have so many party leaders now that he doesnt get to speak much. I suspect thats the reason, he said.
With MP Weerawansa deciding to be independent, Jayasekara pointed out that he would simply now be considered as any other member and be sent to the backbenches of Parliament.
The SLFP Minister said Weerawansa and his four supporters needed to also formally write to UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera to declare that they would sit independently in Parliament. They cannot say that to the Speaker. It is the UPFA General Secretary that they need to write to, said Jayasekara.
On Wednesday, Weerawansa and four others from the NFF declared that they would sit independently of the UPFA and asked that the Speaker recognize them as an independent party in Parliament.

Payne was the only One Direction member in attendance Wednesday (22), accepting the award from One Direction mastermind Simon Cowell.
In his speech, Payne acknowledged the group's time off, but reassured fans that"One Direction is who we are, it's who we always will be."
Despite not being there to say thank you in person, Tomlinson and Horan also took to Twitter to send their love to fans."You guys to continue to surprise us with how incredible you are over and over again," Tomlinson said in a video.

Ongoing development will create 500,000 jobs: Ravi
The ongoing development projects under the administration of the Good Governance regime will generate 500,000 jobs within the next six months, said Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
He said therefore, the youth should prepare for the big opportunity. Karunanayake said this at a ceremony to lay the foundation stone for a swimming pool at Vystwyke Park in Mattakkuliya on Wednesday.
Karunanayake said the government is facing a problem in providing employment as the majority of youths are seeking employment in the public sector.
The youth give preference to government sector employment. But the private sector salaries a much higher, perhaps three times higher than the public sector. However, private sector employees are expected to work three times harder than expected in the public sector.
Around 500,000 jobs will be generated under the ongoing development projects within the next 6 months. When a foreign investor is prepared to offer 1,000 jobs, we only have 100 qualified applicants. This situation should change," he said adding that an attitudinal change in youth is essential.
" Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao changed the social situation in India two decades ago. India, receives its highest revenue from America through Information Technology today as a result. We should also follow that system," he said.
He said when the government tries to do something innovative, the bankrupt Opposition is quick to level allegations. "However, we are not deterred by such allegations. Dynamic people are always targeted. If we too were inactive, nobody would have blamed us. Therefore, we do not work according to the advice of the Opposition but according to the advice of the people, Karunanayake said.
The foundation stone was laid for the swimming pool and construction is expected to be completed by next October at a cost of Rs.100 million .
Meanwhile, the foundation stone for the sports complex on 17th Lane in Kotahena was also laid by the minister. The project will cost Rs.50 million. Colombo Municipal Council Commissioner V.A. K. Anura and several former Municipal Councillors participated.

Pan Asia Bank closed its financial year ended December 31, 2016 recording a profit before tax of Rs 1.8 billion, an increase of 17% over the previous year.
Meanwhile the Bank increased its Profit after tax by 20% for the same period to Rs.1.25 billion or Rs.4.24 a share, surpassing its previous earnings record.
This commendable performance is a result of the combination of factors from the timely re-pricing of assets and liabilities, re-calibration of assets in to more remunerative areas, better recoveries and asset quality, the relatively strong growth in loans and receivables and better management of costs in all areas of the banking business during the year.

If established in Sri Lanks: Indias Coca Cola factory could diminish our natural water sources:Devananda
EPDP leader Parliamentarian Douglas Devananda yesterday, stated that the Coca Cola factory proposed to be established in Sri Lanka would further reduce the island's already diminishing natural water sources and queried as to what the Government plans to avert a serious crisis.
MP Devananda made this observation yesterday, in a special statement under Standing Order 23/2.He also said that the Coca Cola Company was attempting to set up its largest manufacturing plant in the South Asian region in Sri Lanka to supply to its largest market in the region which is India.
MP Devananda said that currently the Coca Cola was facing serious criticism in India.
He added that there were around 57 coca cola plants in India and they criticized the Indian legal system for the violation of the water usage limits. He also said due to the severe drought in India, their courts had banned the company from using water from the Thamirabarani River.
He added that under such a situation, the Coca Cola Company was planning to set up its manufacturing plant in Sri Lanka and use our water sources.
He further said that although the company would bring in profits from foreign exchange and numerous employment opportunities, the damage that could be done to the islands water sources would be tremendous.
MP Devananda also said that Sri Lanka was also facing a serious drought.
"However Coca Cola wanted to use our water resources to meet the market demands of their largest consumer market in the region," MP Devananda said. "How could we permit this, he queried.

Pope suggests it's better to be an atheist than a bad Christian

If you're a Christian who exploits people, leads a double life or manages a "dirty" business, perhaps it's better not to call yourself a believer, Pope Francis suggested in a homily on Thursday (23) in Rome.
"So many Christians are like this, and these people scandalize others," Francis said during morning Mass at Casa Santa Marta, according to Vatican Radio. "How many times have we heard -- all of us, around the neighborhood and elsewhere -- 'But to be a Catholic like that, it's better to be an atheist.' It is that: scandal."
"But what is scandal Scandal is saying one thing and doing another."
In the Catholic Church, causing scandal also a grave offense.
Examples of such sins abound, the Pope said, from money launderers to business owners who take beach vacations while stiffing their employees.
Pope Francis' sermon, as is customary, was an extended riff onThursday's Mass readings, which include a passage from the Gospel on Mark. In it, Jesus says it is better to be drowned than to cause others to sin.
Drawing on that passage, the Catholic Catechism says scandals include business leaders who encourage fraud, teachers who agitate students and manipulators who turn people away from moral values.
In other words, anyone who leads others to do wrong, directly or indirectly, is responsible for the evil he has encouraged, the church says. So when Pope Francis compares hypocritical Christians to atheists, he's not being flip; he's trying to protect his flock.
In the United States, some Catholics have cited the church's teachings on scandal to argue that priests should not distribute Holy Communion to politicians who support abortion rights. Pope Francis, a sharp critic of capitalist excesses, turned his scorn instead on greedy businesspeople.
Fake Christians
While many of this Pope's pronouncements are often assumed to be novel interpretations of Christian doctrines, Pope Francis was also touching on an ancient debate: Is salvation open to all believers, or only those who do good while on earth
The Pope suggested the latter, in characteristically blunt language.
He imagined a wealthy Christian knocking at the gates of heaven and saying, "Here I am, Lord! ... I went to Church, I was close to you, I belong to this association, I did this... Don't you remember all the offerings I made"
To which Jesus may reply, according to the Pope:
"Yes, I remember. The offerings, I remember them: All dirty. All stolen from the poor. I don't know you.' That will be Jesus' response to these scandalous people who live a double life."
Thursday's sermon is far from the first time Francis has targeted Christian hypocrites. In asermon last February, the outspoken Pope called out the "fakeness" of Christians who talk piously, but do little to help others.
"To be a Christian means to do: to do the will of God -- and on the last day -- because all of us we will have one -- that day what shall the Lord ask us Will He say: 'What you have said about me' No. He shall ask us about the things we did."
It isn't the first time the Pope has mentioned atheists, either.In 2013, he raised questions for saying that heaven is open, potentially, to all people.
"The Lord has redeemed all of us, all of us, with the Blood of Christ: all of us, not just Catholics. Everyone. "'Father, the atheists' Even the atheists. Everyone!"
Pope Francis continued, "We must meet one another doing good. 'But I don't believe, Father, I am an atheist!' But do good: we will meet one another there."
The Vatican later issued a note clarifying that the Pope was simply saying that God's grace is free to all, even atheists, and urging Christians and non-believers to work together.

A practical approach  to Traffic Management
Sri Lankan working population is very badly in need of rapid transport modes to reach their work destinations in a much reduced time span and also to get back after the office hours within the shortest possible time to be with their families and also to relax after a hard days work, possibly with some entertainment added to the relaxation.
However, both the public and private sector staff are finding it extremely impossible to get the much needed relaxation mainly due to traffic congestions mainly in Colombo and extending to other major towns on the borders of Colombo.
This is mainly due to excessive number of vehicles on the road, non working of signal lights, inefficient traffic control by traffic policemen, excessive numbers of pedestrians crossing roads, reckless and selfish drivers, lower penalties on offending drivers, vehicle breakdowns, accidents and a number of other factors.
Japanese businessmen always endeavor to house their office and residence at the same location so that they do not have to waste time on the road coming to their work places and getting back saving precious time adding to their daily productivity levels.
In our country, vehicle owners spend considerable time on the road for unproductive travel also. Most of advanced countries utilize the high speed rail network with the using of so called bullet trains to transport the office workers from distances of over 400 kilometers also at times. The working population hardly feel the time passing as they are quite comfortable inside the trains. In Thailand, the use of rivers for transportation has become popular and convenient.
The famous Chao Pryar river is the best example. The main reason for traffic congestions is the centralization of almost all top offices in the main cities or in the capital cities of countries. Good examples are Colombo, Mumbai, New York, London, Bangkok and many other major towns all over the world. With the ever rising working population, the major cities are facing the problem of traffic management throughout the day. In some countries even the directors and top management come to office by using motor cycles as the motor cyclists resort to driving along the pavements as well to reach their destinations in time.
In Sri Lanka some of the practical examples are highlighted below. The traffic jams occur in all roads from Colombo to outstations and Colombo suburbs especially in the afternoon. The most notable roads are from Colombo to Moratuwa, Homagama, Ja-Ela and Kadawata. At times it may well take two hours to reach Moratuwa from the Colombo city. The problem aggravates during rainy days. The drivers and passengers are facing the agony of spending over 3 to 4 hours on the road coming to work and getting back. However, it may be possible to reach Chilaw in 90 minutes with imaginative driving. Trains are frequently used by office workers coming to Colombo from outstations as there are no worries of traffic congestions.
The only problems for them is the sudden cancellation of trains due to union action and the non availability of adequate seats due to over crowding. A visit to Kandy may well take over four hours after 5 P.M. with vehicles entering the main road from access roads and lanes. For a very long time, the traffic problems keep haunting the minds of all office workers.
Successive governments are paying attention to traffic management for a long period but still have not found complete solutions to ease the situation.
Another difficult time for the motorists will be the school closure times with traffic jams prevailing for over one hour. Motorcyclists, Three wheeler drivers, Container transporters and Lorries transporting goods add to the problems by joining the lengthy vehicle queues at peak periods.
I strongly feel that we should employ a separate minister to handle traffic management only, as our productivity levels depend very much on easing traffic congestion. Right now they leave it to the traffic police.
From the point of view of foreign and local investors also traffic blues will be a negative point. Smooth flow of raw materials & finished goods will reduce the transport, handling, loading & unloading costs of their respective business ventures. For example a foreigner going to a hotel in Mount Lavinia area will encounter the traffic jam in the evening and will wonder why a vehicle takes over 90 minutes to cover around 18 kilometers in the Colombo district.
The recent proposed guidelines for three wheeler drivers and for the purchase of three wheelers will no doubt will do a world of good and is very much in the interests of motorists. The three wheeler numbers increased during the last two decades without any regulatory framework to arrest heavy traffic situations. Road rules are violated mainly by the three wheeler drivers. They have been charging passengers exorbutant rates up to now and it would be in public interest to make it mandatory for them to install meters and also to display their identity clearly.
The 25% ceiling on leasing will reduce the owners monthly costs for leasing charges and could be easily recovered monthly and there will be a reduction of accidents and road mishaps due to speeding in the eagerness to earn more. The same 25% rate also should have been applied on lorries, buses and all commercial vehicles. So that the monthly leasing charge will come down and the hires also will benefit by way of lower charges.
The rate per kilometer should be Rs.30 at a realistic level even after providing for lost mileage on running. Like in Singapore taxi stands be erected in Colombo and other major cities closer to bus stands so the travellers will have the option of going in the bus or in a metered taxi. Metered taxis will also include the proposed cars run on electricity. There should not be any further delays in implementing this programme. The objectives would be many fold, namely,


1. A lower rate for the travellers, Rs.30 for three wheelers and Rs. 50 for cars run on electricity.
2 .Safety of travellers
3. Reduction of buses plying on Colombo and suburban roads
4. Reduction of air pollution levels
5. Reduction in traffic jams
6. Increased public savings
7. Increased productivity levels in all sectors by reductions in travel times
8. Regular hires for all passenger vehicle owners
9. Lowering of cost of living due to lower
transport costs

To make this scheme successful all vehicles coming into this scheme be registered with a private sector managed institution assisted by different mobile phone companies and reputed banks, finance companies and insurance companies so that the supervision will become easier and productive. This scheme will ensure that only the genuine and hard working drivers are retained in public transport and they will be much disciplined due to the fact that they are being monitored.
The rest will turn to other avenues such as construction and manufacturing. Due to the inadequacy of manual labour, the construction industry now pays between Rs.1,000 to Rs.2,000 per worker depending on skill level sometimes with tea and meals. So our youth could be employed in a productive manner to enhance GDP growth. The functions of this private sector managed instituition will include,

1. Monitoring of all vehicles entering the main cities and compiling of a data bank on vehicles entering cities frequently or on a daily basis

2. Physical observation and control of traffic in all main cities of each district

3. Levying of tolls on vehicles entering the cities on a daily basis

4. Maintenance of data bases on drivers and provision of training facilities including spoken English

5. Imposition of fines on traffic rule violators and even blacklisting of them

6. Decisions and recommendations on new vehicle owners joining the daily traffic movements

7. All new vehicle registrations

8.Training of bus and other passenger transport drivers and crew

9. Installation of cameras with overseas/state assistance to nab traffic offenders

10. Recommendations for school/office time revisions

11. The introduction of sophisticated testing equipment for drunk drivers

12. Checking the accuracy of meters of all hiring vehicles

13. Prevention of accidents by categorization of drivers.

14. Introduction of a token road levy to maintain the road network of the country to be paid equally
by the passengers and the drivers

15. Awarding of points for all drivers based on performance

16. Monitoring and simplification of work procedures at the department of motor traffic

17. Taking steps to further streamlining the leasing procedures and criteria
18. Recommendations on shifting of main public and private sector offices from existing locations to reduce the traffic flow to/from the city

19. Compilation of monthly traffic reports for the benefit of policy makers

20. Evaluation and study of contemporary practices adopted by other countries to arrest city traffic Congestion and collecting of road levies from motorists

21.Taking immeadiate steps to attend to needy repairs to roads and pavements within a matter of hours to ensure smooth traffic flows

22. Transport assistance in productivity enhancement in schools, private& public sectors

I wish to highlight a number of practical situations where improvements are needed to enhance the efficiency of existing systems and also for environmental protection.

1. To avoid formation of large queues to pay the toll at exit points of highways, the drivers should be requested through media to bring the exact amount of cash, especially during weekends where heavy traffic formation is possible.

2. Shifting of all shops selling consumer goods, restaurants & barsa few yards back to avoid parking of vehicles by their customers

3. Pavement hawkers be assigned a separate place of business to ensure pedestrians do not step into the roads

4. All vehicle drivers, conductors and passengers should be banned from chewing betel inside public transport vehicles to avoid instances of spitting on roads and public places

5. Separate bus services should be operated for school children, Public sector staff and private sector Staff at different times on a planned time table. In the sixtees there were separate school service Buses run by the central transport board

6. For executive staff,a separate executive bus service at a higher fare be also introduced with added Comforts

7. Use of 'Dendro Power' for running of buses should be tried to maintain/reduce the existing bus fares as this may well cut down the running costs. This is practiced in many countries

8. Looking ahead solar powered buses could be introduced to bring in the green effects for Transportation and to avoid environmental pollution

9. Introduction of larger comfortable separate seats in public transport systems will lure the motor car Owners to travel in buses leaving their cars at home. There will be an immeadiate reduction of the number of vehicles on roads

10. Beautification of central bus stands and railway stations will also attract more passengers to travel in public transport systems leaving their personal vehicles at home. A project for beautification of railway stations was initiated by the lions movement in 1991 with assistance from the railways department for which the writer assisted as an observer. The Rambukkana station was adjudged as the best station.

11.Vendors and others soliciting money from passengers be totally banned making the journey a pleasant one for all.

12. Turning off from main roads to other sides of the roads at junctions be eliminated to The maximum.A good example is turning of vehicles at William grinding mills close to Dehiwala where huge traffic jams are experienced on a daily basis.As an alternative the drivers should be diverted through Hill street at Dehiwala junction to drive towards Nugegoda.

13. Construction of additional tracks between railway stations so that trains need not have to stop at stations waiting for other trains to pass, sometimes causing over 30 minute delays.

14. Levelling of pavements so that the pedestrians will have smooth and quick walks rather than walking on uneven surfaces taking time

15.VIP travel should be minimized on peak hours and video conferencing facilities should be provided for meetings. This is even suitable for the public and private sector also.

16. Special walks, processions and trade union/student/other protests be banned by law causing traffic congestions and the protesters should be allowed to protest only at specified venues. This menace has done irreparable damage to our economy and productivity levels.

17. Notices on Religious processions and festivals be informed to the public via media days before the events on a daily basis so that motorists will use other routes or leave early

18. Speed limits should be strictly adhered to by all motorists and the traffic police should use Speedometers at suspected locations for speeding and charge offenders on the spot

19. Metered taxi stands be erected at shopping malls,outside hotels and at main junctions like in Singapore where the scheme has benefitted both the travellers and taxi services. Taxi services will erect the stands and will also pay an agreed sum as the annual licence fee which could be utilized to provide security to taxi stands throughout the day.

20. Drainage systems at major junctions of Colombo are still at a deplorable level.Take the case of Armour street junction where a heavy shower for 30 minutes will create water levels of over 10 inches. We had three phases of Greater Colombo flood control projects many years back but still the situation remains the same.

21. Repair work on main roads take months and years.The work should be completed within a few days employing a large number of workers.A good example is the current work at Thurstan road.

22. The traffic police personnel be rewarded with incentives for ensuring smooth vehicle flows.
The traffic management process will involve,

1. The ascertainment of facts and data
2. Physical Observation
3. Introduction of productive changes
4. Progress monitoring
5. Feedback information
6. Innovation and value addition
7. Regular communication via media
8. Strict adherence to the new systems

Presidents admission
President Maithripala Sirisena has dropped a bombshell of sorts. Addressing SLFP organisers at the Presidents House on Wednesday, the President revealed that there were rogues and wrong doers in the previous regime as well as the present one and that he has kept this uppermost in his mind when working. President Sirisena is the first Executive President to own up that there were rogues in his government (SWRD Bandaranaike took action against certain MPs who were convicted of bribery). Of course, President Premadasa too came out with the revelation that there were thieves in his government. But this was after the Lalith Gamini duo left the government and tried to impeach Premadasa. Those familiar with the politics of that era would recall the rash of neu gilla, Mahaweliya keva (ships were sunk and Mahaweliya was devoured) posters that appeared throughout the country at the same time.
JRJ, while not directly admitting that there were rouges in his government, nevertheless increased the salaries and perks of his ministers on the basis that this will keep them out of temptations way. President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga did not reveal that there were thieves in her government but only that there were those who besmirched her good name, mage moone deli gewa, after the infamous Wayamba election which was rigged to glory, courtesy prominent members of her government.
In that sense President Sirisenas admission is a first and is bound to be met with mixed reactions.
There will be those who will acknowledge the Presidents candidness in admitting that there were indeed rogues in his government while others would ask what was he doing about it
Politicians in the present day are not of the same make and breed that the people came to know in the immediate post Independence era. That was a time when politics was strictly a public service that attracted philanthropists, benefactors of various causes and the upper echelons of society who were awash with the dosh and did not need politics to stand up financially. Of course there were a few among this breed who sought upward social mobility and used politics as a convenient vehicle for this purpose.
Today, things have changed drastically, with politics being a livelihood for some while for others it is a means of becoming super rich. It is an open secret today how those who did not even posses the means to purchase a push cycle are riding in flashy SUVs and Pajeros while owning property and mansions overseas. With no academic qualifications required to become a parliamentarian, it was party time for all and sundry, the riff-raff included, as it is all too evident today.
True, one can blame the open economy as the primary cause for the level of corruption one sees in present day politics. The liberalization of the economy and the dismantling of safeguards and barriers had certainly opened the doors for financial crimes such as money laundering on a scale never heard before. It is also equally true that the type of individuals who have entered politics had contributed in a large scale towards the present malaise. Those with criminal records and unsavoury characters have today laid siege on the body politic, muscling their way to plunder and ill gotten wealth, using the political power at their disposal. Both main parties are guilty of harbouring such elements in their midst but entertain them for their voting getting value. The Proportional Representation system has only exacerbated matters.
Now that the President, no less, has admitted that there are rogues even in the government it is incumbent on him to identify such elements and weed them out .He will no doubt cover himself with glory by such an act as the first Head of State to show the door to his own men who are corrupt . After all, he is on record stating that the people did not get rid of one set of rogues to replace them with another set. Besides there is his mandate to fulfill to cleanse the body politic of corrupt elements.
Namals mea culpa
Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa has made a mea culpa of sorts, perhaps on behalf of his father former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The eldest of the Rajapaksa progeny, the other day, speaking to journalists outside the Supreme Court, said that he felt incarcerating former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka was wrong and that it is better if it did not happen. In the same breath the former first son says that the he (Fonseka) was imprisoned through a legal procedure after allegations were made against him and that they, meaning the Rajapaksas, did not take revenge by politically insulting him. It is obvious to even a political novice that Fonseka was imprisoned for politically challenging Mahinda Rajapaksa, in a clear act of revenge. The fact that nothing is heard of the case brought against Fonseka is a clear indication of this. If depriving the war winning Army Commander of his civic rights was not political revenge let Namal explain what it is.

Presidential Commission on bond issue: SSC challenges contents of Jan. 01, 2015 gazette

In a surprise move, Senior State Counsel Dr. Avanti Perera yesterday challenged the contents of the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1895/19 issued on January 1, 2015.
She rose to point out a discrepancy in the said gazette notification. The said gazette notification included details of Treasury Bonds for the years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.
She then elaborated and made another point to say that the same gazette notification gave the details of the controversial
Treasury bond issuance conducted on the February 27, 2015 and March 31, 2016.
The said gazette notification was issued during the tenure of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Finance Minister.
Dr. Avanti Perera led the evidence together with Presidents Counsel Additional Solicitor General Yasanta Kodagoda at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds.
The Presidential Commission comprised of Supreme Court judges Justice K.T. Chitrasri , Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and Retired Deputy Auditor General Kandasamy Veluppillai.
While questioning the Secretary to the Finance Ministry Dr.R.H.S.Samaratunge,Avanti Perera pointed out the discrepancy she observed in the said gazette notification.
At this point the President of the Commission Justice K.T. Chitrasiri said the Commission has decided to verify from the Government Printer as to the date on which the said gazette notification was printed.
Accordingly Presidents Counsel Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera was instructed by the Presidential Commission to record a statement from the Government Printer immediately regarding the said gazette. Proceedings took a new turn as Dr. Avanti Perera questioned Dr. Samaratunga, if, to his understanding, a gazette notification must be published in terms of section 4.1 of the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance as soon as the cash roll statement has been sent by the TOD and the Central Bank decided the mode of issuing treasury bonds.
Dr. Perera also questioned Dr. Samaratunga whether he is aware that a gazette notification that was challenged, has been published dated 1 January, 2015 bearing the gazette extraordinary number 1895/19, to which the latter answered in the negative .
Dr. Perera also pointed out to Dr. Samaratunga that there are several notices referring to particular treasury bond issuance which the then Minister of Finance, the Former President has signed.
It was pointed out by the Presidential Commission that Dr. Samaratunga cannot be aware of such a gazette notification since he was not the Secretary to the Finance Ministry at that time.
Dr. Perera also questioned Dr. Samaratunge whether he is aware the gazette notification challenged, reflects details of a transaction that took place two months thereafter, which is also the main subject matter of the Presidential Commission.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardane summarizing the point made by Dr. Perera re-phrased the argument as follows.
So your point is that anybody who went through the said gazette could have known that there was a notice published on the 1 January 2015 that the Central Bank intends to issue 10.05 billion 30 year bonds on March01, 2015.

He ordered them to submit a report to him on the deaths of the turtles and produce the suspects to court if unruly activities of human beings have led to the deaths of the turtles.
A large number of turtles were found dead in the costal belt from Hambantota to Tangalle for unknown reasons. Kalametiya Wildlife OIC Uthpala Adaranga appearing before the Tangalle Magistrate said the turtles had no wounds on their bodies, but they had died under unnatural circumstances. He said the turtles must have got entangled to the fishing nets thrown by the fisher folk to catch Madu fish and the turtles must have died of suffocation.
The bodies of 30 turtles that died have been sent to the elephant transit home at Udawalawa.

'Refugees Welcome' banner removed from Statue of Liberty
US: National Park police are investigating who illegally placed a Refugees Welcome on the base of the Statue of Liberty on Tuesday afternoon.
The banner, which measured 3-feet by 20-feet, was unfurled atop the statues pedestal just before 1pm. It was affixed to the public observation deck by nylon rope and rangers removed the banner nearly an hour later.
An activist only identified as David told Fusion that he was one of the people behind the banner.
This was first conceived in response to whats been called the travel ban of the Trump administration, which I think flies in the face of the founding principals of the United States, he told the news outlet. I think.
President Trump is expected to sign a new executive order in the name of protecting America from foreign terror networks. His first order banned citizens from seven majority Muslim countries and was blocked in a federal court last month.
Later in the day, an activist group named Alt Lady Liberty" claimed responsibility for the display.
"Almost all Americans have descendants from somewhere else," the group said in a statement to CNN. "Immigrants and refugees make this country great. And turning away refugees, like we did to Anne Frank, does not make us great. Refugees are welcome here, Muslims are welcome here and immigrants are welcome here.
"And it's not just our ancestors. Every American knows an immigrant or a refugee. We wanted to send a reminder about America when we're at our best  the country that's a beacon of freedom to the world, built by immigrants. Walling off countries or entire religions is against our values. That's what the Statue of Liberty stands for." - THE INDEPENDENT

Rules and regulations to safeguard patientss rights
More rules and regulations will be brought to safeguard the rights of patients. The majority of Sri Lankans suffer from mental stress. It is one of the main reasons for increasing Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs), Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
The minister made these observations after opening the web site of `Mahajana Suwadhana' Exhibition' to be held from July 14 to 16 at the BMICH in Colombo.According to the minister, he has paid special attention towards patients' rights and doctors' ethics. Rules and regulations have stipulated 10 minutes as the minimum consultation time for a patient.
Dr. Senaratne said if the rules and regulations are not implemented, consultant doctors examine patients similar to the way electric meters do. A doctor's maximum consultation charge has been limited to Rs. 2,000, he said. After performing a surgery, the doctor should stay with the patient for at least an hour. The number of consultants should be increased to the level of the consultants of foreign countries, the minister said.
A Cabinet proposal will be submitted to increase taxes on sugar, salt and fat to protect the people from NCDs. Diseases such as dengue and HIV/AIDS need to be controlled, the minister said.

The Health Ministry will introduce solar power electricity to state hospitals. The monthly electricity bill of a state hospital is around Rs. 3 million. It will cost billions of rupees annually, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had expressed these views during a recent visit to the Tangalle hospital. The Health Ministry spends around another Rs. one million to repair electricity systems in state hospitals annually. The ministry will add all state hospitals to a solar power electricity generating system by providing solar panels to them. It will save billions of rupees to the government, the sources said.
Measures will be taken to commence a courier service to transport drugs to Provincial Hospitals according to a concept of Minister Dr. Senaratne.

Pathirana, a recent graduate of the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology, is employed at the London Stock Exchange Group's new facility at Trace Expert City, where she works with some of Sri Lanka's best and brightest technology professionals in providing support to the Group's worldwide network.
Utilising a computational approach to reduce the complexity of a legal statement, Pathirana's research delved into information extraction, information retrieval, question analysis and answer generation techniques as methods to derive better meanings for legal statements.
Positing that, if legal statements are analysed as questions, more information could be retrieved from the WordNet and LawNet networks via a process that mostly functions like a search engine. Research results showed an accuracy level of 80% on average, for a 1,500-item dataset.
Held under the theme, Breakthrough to Excellence, the 2nd Asia Pacific Conference on Contemporary Research highlighted up-to-date academic research being carried out in the disciplines of Business, Social Sciences, Education, and Information and Communications Technology (ICT).

Sri Lanka refugees who sheltered Snowden in Hong Kong being hunted
Sri Lankan asylum seekers living in Hong Kong fear they are being illegally pursued by police after sheltering the US whistleblower Edward Snowden in the city.
Criminal investigators from Sri Lanka are believed to have visited Hong Kong looking for them, their lawyer said.
The Sri Lankan police have denied the allegations.
Law enforcement authorities from mainland China or other countries have no jurisdiction in Hong Kong.
The lawyer representing the men, Robert Tibbo, said that at least two officers from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Sri Lanka police visited Hong Kong in December looking for them.
"We have become aware of Sri Lankan police taking active steps to locate my clients," he said, adding: "They identified themselves to members of the Sri Lankan community in Hong Kong. They carried photographs and files."
Sri Lankan police spokesman Priyantha Jayakodi said the allegation was "a complete lie".
"We have not done any investigation in Hong Kong or any other country on any refugee case," he told BBC Sinhala.
However Mr Tibbo said the evidence came from Sri Lankans living in Hong Kong who were approached on the street in late December by people who carried official identification. His clients fed and housed Mr Snowden for two weeks in June 2013 when he fled the US after leaking thousands of documents belonging to the US National Security Agency (NSA).
The former IT contractor subsequently left Hong Kong for Moscow.
The names of the asylum seekers, Kellapatha Supun Thilina and Debagma Kankanalamage Ajith Pushpa Kumara, were revealed last year by Mr Tibbo, ahead of the September premiere of the film Snowden by the director Oliver Stone.
He said that it would have been difficult to keep their identities secret after the film's release.
Tibbo believes the Sri Lankan government began investigating the asylum seekers shortly afterwards.
The lawyer says Sri Lankan officials may have noted the disappearances of the Causeway Bay booksellers and the Chinese billionaire Xiao Jianhua - who some fear may have been forcibly taken from Hong Kong to mainland China.
"With the Hong Kong government not holding Beijing accountable, and the lack of transparency, this amounts to an invitation to other governments in the world," Mr Tibbo said. - BBC

Wimals request to part from the UPFA: Amaraweera wants him to resign first
UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday asked NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa to send his letter of resignation from the UPFA to him, so that a decision on it could be taken immediately.
The Minister made this comment in Parliament yesterday, reacting to a request made by NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa to sit as an independent group in Parliament.
The NFF contested the elections from the UPFA, but it is not a constituent party in the UPFA. If he makes this request from us we can consider it without delay. We are in a drive to restructure and strengthen the party. The NFF members got elected to Parliament exploiting the SLFP voter base. They will come to know their real power when they separate from our party he said.
Replying to this statement MP Wimal Weerawansa said that he had already drafted the letter and that it would be handed over to Amaraweera before he leaves the chamber.
I believe you have no intention to retain us in the Alliance forcibly. Please be kind enough to accept the letter and inform the Speaker in that regard he said.
Amaraweera agreeing to this said the decision would be communicated soon.

Women in Management, IFC launch seventh Professional Career Awards 2017
Women in Management (WIM) and IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, are inviting nominations for the 'Top 50' Professional and Career Women Awards 2017.
Now in its seventh edition, these awards recognize women who inspire others with their successes in career, business, and everyday life.
IFC and WIM work together in Sri Lanka to provide skill-building and training opportunities for women who lead, or work in, micro and small businesses.
This is the third consecutive year that IFC will partner with WIM to host the Professional and Career Women Awards.
Sulochana Segera, Founder/Chairperson of Women in Management, said, "It is fitting that the theme for 2017 is Beyond Parity-Developing Tomorrow's Women Leaders. Sri Lanka is at cross-roads, with many local companies on the verge of evolving their leadership for a new age of equal opportunity. Now in its seventh edition, we want to continue to shine a light on the achievements of Sri Lanka's most remarkable women, which will also help inspire the next generation of women leaders."
Nominations for these awards are open from February 25 to May 30, 2017.
Zahiya Zareer, Head of Mission, Maldivian High Commission in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Sulochana Segera, Founder/Chairperson of Women in Management, Henriette Kolb, Head of the Gender Secretariat at IFC, Dr. Rohantha Athukorala, Chairman of Lanka Sathosa /2017 Panel Judge at the event.
The awards ceremony will be held on July 14, at the Cinnamon Grand hotel in Colombo. Nominations can be made by visiting www.womeninmanagementawards.org.
Dr. Rohantha Athukorala, Chairman of Lanka Sathosa and a 2017 Panel Judge said, "The WIM top 50 career awards has become one the most respected events in Sri Lanka, attracting the highest number of entries and high-powered professionals as judges."

"No country can afford to lose half its talent pool. When female employees are unable to realize their full economic potential, businesses, communities, and economies are affected," said Henriette Kolb, Head of the Gender Secretariat at IFC.

Collaborative approach needed to help local dairy farmers
A collaborative approach to drive commercially sustainable farming businesses is needed to help local dairy farmers better respond to the current challenges and lift both the quality and amount of milk they produce, the National Livestock Development Board (NLDB), Chairman Professor H. W. Cyril said.
He was speaking at a seminar under the theme, Dairy: Flourishing farmers to nourishing Sri Lankans held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) recently.
Highlighting common challenges which include lack of farm business knowledge, the rising costs of farming inputs and the limited availability of both land and high-quality cattle, Professor Cyril said these challenges are affecting Sri Lankas 300,000 small-scale dairy farmers, which together currently produce around 80 per cent of local milk supply.
On average, these farms have only three to five cows, and are run as family businesses with limited resources and inadequate farm management knowledge.
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hon. Dr. Harsha De Silva, speaking at the event said the local dairy industry has huge potential to drive the economy.
The agricultural sector employs 30 percent of the Sri Lankan workforce, but contributes just 9 percent of the national GDP. This tells us that the productivity of this sector has an immense potential to grow, and as Ive seen from my recent visit to New Zealand, agriculture and in particular dairy has the potential to be a strong pillar of our economy, Dr De Silva said.
He added further added that developing the local dairy industry can play a role in closing the local supply and demand gap, and uplift the livelihoods of small to medium farming entrepreneurs. (IH)

Political, geographic fragmentation hampering wealth formation
Sri Lankas legacy of political, geographic fragmentation prevented the formation of its own wealth, Calamander Capital, Singapore Director, Mafaz Ishaq said.
Making opening remarks at a conference on Capital markets 2017 held in Colombo, he said Sri Lanka as a country lacked the ability to accumulate its own wealth due to long drawn political geographic fragmentation. He stressed that private gain, public good need not be in conflict and to reinforce this principle, proactive polices and regulations need to be adopted soon.
The business case for the development of the capital market is self evident. They mobilise savings from productive investments or the price discovery mechanisms which make the economy more dynamic, efficient and transparent.It is no doubt that robust capital markets are defining the features of every advanced economy.
Commodities and future markets stabilize the price of essential food products and even help prevent famine.
Debt markets enable banks to expand their access to business loans, mortgage finance. Retail investments products like bonds, mutual funds allow families to diversify protect their assets, in order to plan for their important life goals, such as education and retirement.
Regional sub continental even global integration is more than ever before, he said adding that no amount of technology can ever substitute for trust as market only work when participants believe when they are fair and transparent.
Quality of corporate governance in the region must be raised, subsequently, Sri Lankan companies would be able to grow into corporations with continental, global reach. Ishaq said.
He said the capital markets depend on integration technology entrust and they are part of the infrastructure optimism, upon which Sri Lankas prosperity arises.

Abductions in Colombo during 2009: Navy intelligence officer further remanded
Lieutenant Commander Dhammika Anil Mapa, a Navy Intelligence officer attached to the Welisara Navy camp arrested for allegedly abducting a resident of Kotahena in 2009 was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till March 9 by Colombo Additional Magistrate J. Trotsky.
The Additional Magistrate is to announce his bail order regarding the suspect on the next hearing date.
The Court permitted the CID to record a statement from former Senior DIG Anura Senanayake on February 28 in connection with two abductions that took place in 2009.
It is alleged the former Senior DIG covered up evidence into an incident in which two persons had been abducted by an unidentified group from the Kotahena and Wellawatte areas in 2009.
The CID conducting investigations into an incident where several persons had been abducted by unidentified groups in Colombo and the surrounding areas in 2009 had informed Court on a previous occasion that former Navy Intelligence Director Rear Admiral Ananda Guruge is to be arrested over the disappearance of two individuals in Kotahena.
The OIC of the CIDs Gang Robbery Unit-Inspector Nishantha Silva informed Court that former Navy Intelligence Director Ananda Guruge and Lieutenant Commander Sampath Dayananda, a former Navy intelligence officer attached to the Welisara Navy camp would be arrested soon regarding the investigations on the abductions and disappearances of Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan and Rathnasami Paramanandan.
Inspector Nishantha Silva informed Court that the van of Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan was found at the Welisara Navy Camp while being discarded and cut into 72 pieces.
However, Presidents Counsel Anil Silva appearing for the suspect had denied the allegations leveled against his client but admitted the fact that the Navy Intelligence Unit had taken the concerned vehicle into their custody following a report that it contained a bomb concealed and compelled to cut into pieces for the purpose of searching explosive substances.
The CID submitted to Court that there is no legal provision vested with the Navy to carry out such a step and informed Court that the Navy should have brought the matter to the attention of police and bomb disposal unit.
The Colombo Crimes Division initiated investigations into these abductions on the instructions of the IGP following a complaint by then Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda in 2009.
The CID also informed the court that 11 abducted individuals had been detained at the Trincomalee underground detention centre violating their basic human rights.

Agreement cancellation saves millions to SriLankan Airlines
The SriLankan Airlines would have suffered a loss of over US$ 205 million over the next 12 years if the aircraft leasing agreement with Air Cap Cooperation was not terminated, state Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim said clarifying certain press reports published on the cabinet memorandum he had submitted on the issue.
The minister said these press reports contained certain falsehoods deliberately aimed to crate a clash between his ministry and the Finance Ministry.
Minister Kabir Hasheem said during the previous regime the lease agreement on these new aircraft had been signed for a monthly rental of 1425000 US dollars when it could have been early obtained in a monthly rental of 950000 US dollars.
The statement added that after the agreement was abrogated the Air Cap Cooperation had demanded a sum of 154 million dollars as cancellation fees but the cabinet of Minister granted an opportunity for Sri Lankan Airlines to negotiate with the cooperation to reliance it to 75 to 85 million dollars. At the last round of discussions held by Sri Lankan Airlines the cooperation had agreed to reduce the 154 million dollars to 98 million dollars.
Thus the Airline had been able to reduce the potential from 205 million dollars to 98 million dollars. The statement added their the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime had undermined confidence and acted fraudulently by trying to pay rentals over and above the normal market ratio in signing the lease agreement.
An investigation into the capacity of these air planes had proved they were unsuitable and could not be used profitably in keeping with the Sri Lanka Airlines business plan.
Two companies involved in Air traffic named NYRAS and Sky Works for had reported that these new planes would be an unbearable economic burden on the people of this country and recommended that their lease agreement be terminated.

Trotsky for allegedly cheating and misappropriating Rs.125 million of public funds when purchasing a stock of leaf springs to the SLTB between 2010 and 2012.

The CID further alleged that the suspect had supplied the leaf springs to SLTB with a deficiency, which amounted Rs.24 million and Rs.101 million respectively. The CID had further alleged that the former SLTB Chairman had given his authorisation for the concerned financial transactions acting in his capacity as the then Chairman of SLTB. The CID further informed Court that original documents pertaining to this fraudulent transaction had been destroyed by previous administration and a complaint regarding this incident had been made by present SLTB Chairman Ramal Siriwardena. The suspects are charged under the offences come under Public Property Act.
However, Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa appearing for the former SLTB Chairman had denied allegations levelled against his client citing that there is no evidence to prove that his client involved in the financial transaction.
He further told Court that his client had been subjected to a bypass surgery in 2014 and that fact be considered as an exceptional circumstance to release him on bail.
At a previous occasion, Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris had issued an order directing the Controller of the Emigration and Immigration to prevent four individuals including the former SLTB Chairman, Nandana Priyantha, Sanjeewa Waidyatilleke and Sumith Hettiarachchi from leaving the country.

When former President Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed Prof. Carlo Fonseka as the President of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) during his tenure, Prof. Fonseka had agreed to resolve all issues pertaining to SAITM although he is now singing a different tune, Movement for Free Education and Freedom to Education Co-convener Saman Rathnapriya said.
Addressing a media briefing held yesterday, he said, that Prof. Fonseka had accepted that SAITM was a good idea those days. But, now he is against it under this government. During his observation tour to the SAITM sometime ago, he has told that he can vouch for its standards with his own blood. Now, he has forgotten all these things.
Nine out of ten professors who recently inspected SAITM have said that SAITM mets the all required standards.
Although, the SLMC is supposed to stipulate the minimum standards of Medical faculties in Sri Lanka, it has not done so this far from its inception. So, it has neglected its responsibilities. The SLMC is also empowered to register foreign universities which award medical degrees. But it has been registering those universities without any investigation. We ask the SLMC, if they can allow KDU medical students to do clinical studies at Kalubowila Teaching hospital, why cannot
they allow SAITM students to do the same as both institutions offer degrees by charging money. Those who got through the GCE Advanced Level Exam cannot enter to the university. Only 26000 students enter the universities and around 55,000 students follow higher educational courses at private institutes and universities. But, around 66000 students have no way to go because they can not find a job because of lack of skills.

He made this observation in Parliament yesterday while Minister Mahinda Amaraweera commenced speaking with regard to the intelligence officers whom MP Weerawansa spoke about earlier.
Weerawansa said the intelligence officers were taken into remand custody. He added that Major Bulathwatta was among them.
He said it was peculiar that the CID investigators went to Australia to take a statement from Keith Noyahr. The other matter was that the CID had sent the photographs of these officers to Noyahr and later he identified them at the identification parade. The other matter is that these officers had been arrested based on their phones being in the vicinity of the Dehiwala Telecommunication tower at the time of the abduction of Noyahr.
He said it was a fact that the Police does not come under the President but the Army comes under the President. He requested Minister Mahinda Amaraweera not to allow the Police officers who come under Prime Minister to harass Army Officers who come under the President to which Minister Amaraweera replied definitely.

Polythene free home
Very recently, we came across the news of an attempt of few, including responsible authorities to save a sick elephant who has consumed a deadly amount of polythene. It is one of thousands of innocent animals who become victims of our polythene usage. Unfortunately such incidents have become very common today with rampant littering and just a sigh relieves our shock of reading or watching it.
How long can we live with this numb respond and arent we all responsible authorities of this Once there was an article with consequences of using plastics and how it affects ones health. However, since we are aware of everything about polythene and its consequences, all such have become just articles/news while polythene is killing all people and animals gradually.
Considering this, I would like to make a suggestion. From today onwards, lets stop buying plastic items which are poisonous to our mother earth. Lets say NO to all the polythene bags offered by supermarkets even though they are free. Lets find an alternative to pack our lunch without using so called lunch sheets. If one can stop at least that contribution to this, pollution will be reduced and it will matter a lot when it is considered as a life and even your next generation will take the same path. Also, if you search carefully there is an eco-friendly alternative for everything made out of plastic/polythene and only your concern is needed to find them.
Your role in family can be the father, the breadwinner or the mother, the guiding star or the grandparent, the adviser or the elder child, the example to family or the youngest, the free bird and whoever you are in the family, be the first to initiate Polythene/Plastic Free Home concept in your home. Start it today, Mother Earth will appreciate it forever for saving her from this agony and you will be able to die without a guilty conscience one day.

COPE finds certain wrongdoings
Sports Minister and SLFP member for the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday said COPE had found certain wrong doings in the manner in which SAITM was granted approval to establish itself as a private medical campus in 2011.
When COPE was looking into the UGC, the UGC included a note on SAITM. It explained that at the time, the UGC had given six months for SAITM to correct certain shortcomings before it canapply for recognition as a private medical institute. In the meantime, the Ministry of Higher Education passed a gazette in 2011 to empower the Secretary to the Ministry of Higher Education to grant approval for the setting up of SAITM once necessary conditions were met, said Jayasekara addressing a media briefing at the SLFP Headquarters in Darley Road. He further explained that COPE had found no clear evidence to show that the Secretary to the Ministry at the time had appointed a committee to look into whether the conditions were met or not prior to granting approval and there was no evidence of any deliberations made on the issue before arriving at such a decision.
COPE which is currently conducting its periodic review of the UGC thus has also decided to look into the procedural issues which led to setting up of SAITM.
Overall however, we note that the government needs to take a policy decision on private universities without swinging from one end to the other every time theres a change in regime, said the Sports minister.
He explained that while the government was investing in more in universities, it has become necessary that private universities be included in higher education, The question is how are we going to do it,Jayasekara said.
