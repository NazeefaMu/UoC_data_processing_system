Mysterious object is a sea glider
The mysterious object detected by a group of fishermen about nine nautical miles off sea and brought ashore on Thursday, is a sea glider used by National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) for continuous long-term measurement of oceanographic factors, an official of the agency told the media on inquiry.
The sea glider is a deep-diving Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) designed for missions lasting many months and covering thousands of miles and various oceanographic researches. Experiment establishments worldwide use these implements for their underwater research work. NARA also makes use of these buoyant gadgets to examine and analyze the conditions of sea such as salinity, strength, direction of sea currents etc.
We have informed fishermen about these AUVs and not to tamper with them but they are not mindful over our instructions, the official said.
The fishermen who were onboard the fishing trawler Thushan Putha brought the sea glider to the shore as they assumed it to be a part of an aircraft on Thursday.
However, the officials of NARA are planning to go to Galle to bring back the sea glider to the agency.

Abu Dhabi Harlequins hold Kandy SC to 29-all draw
Abu Dhabi Harlequins Rugby Football Club have improved immensely and proved they still remain the benchmark in the West Asia Champion Club tournament when they produced an enthralling 80 minutes of rugby to hold host Kandy Sports Club, the Sri Lankan rugby champions to a 29-all draw at Nittawela yesterday.
After a nervous first half riddled with errors and dropped balls the game came to life in the second half in front of Kandys rugby fans. In a physical first half where both sides tried unsuccessfully to gain the upper momentum, the Quins went into the half time break with a 17-10 lead over the hosts.
The Nittawela boys knew they needed to attack from all areas, but with a depleted squad ravaged with injuries and some on national duty, fatigue began to set in and they made a few mistakes, but fortunately in the last ten minutes managed to gain reasonable possession and territory to hold the Quins to a 29-all draw.
Kandy SCs points came off three goals, one penalty goal and a try to Abu Dhabi Harlequins RFCs three goals and a try and a penalty.
For Kandy Sports Club Anuruddha Wilwara scored two tries, and Lavanga Perera one, a penalty goal and the kicking part by Thilina Wijesinghe and for the Visitors Ben Bolger, Johan Marshal, Lewis Matherson, Christy McCormick scored the tires and Andrew Semple made the kicks at goal. So it was a nailing biting rugby match defending champions had be satisfied with a draw. It was a hotly contested draw-29 all.

All you need to know about new US Open champion
Sloane Stephens has become just the second unranked player to win the US Open since computer rankings began in November 1975. The first was Kim Clijsters from Belgium in 2009.
It was a first grand slam final for the 24-year-old American, who needed just 61 minutes to post a 6-3, 6-0 victory.
So, who is Sloane Stephens
1. Stephens was born in Plantation, Florida and her athleticism is no surprise given her genes. She is the daughter of swimmer Sybil Smith and professional American football player John Stephens.
Her father left the family home when she was a toddler but they were reconciled many years later before he was killed in a car accident in 2009.
2. Stephens was introduced to tennis aged nine by her mother and stepfather, Sheldon Farrell, who died of cancer when she was 14.
She shared a hugely emotional hug with Smith immediately after the match and then paid tribute to her, saying: "I think parents don't get enough credit. When I was 11 years old, my mom took me to a tennis academy. One of the directors there told my mom that I'd be lucky if I was a Division II player and I got a scholarship."
3. Stephens first came close to winning a grand slam title four-and-a-half years ago in Australia. She beat Serena Williams in the quarter-finals before losing to Victoria Azarenka. Afterwards, Stephens went public about what she perceived as a snub by Williams, who had been described as her mentor.
"She's not said one word to me, not spoken to me, not said hi, not looked my way, not been in the same room with me since I played her in Australia," Stephens said. "They think she's so friendly and she's so this and she's so that - no, that's not reality." Stephens later apologised and they have since patched things up.
4. Prior to arriving in New York, the 24-year-old's 2017 earnings stood at $310,000 and her career earnings at $4.5 million, but that now stands at over $8m after she collected a $3.7m winners cheque. She also stands to make millions more in endorsement deals as a result of her triumph.
However, Stephens' wallet may be a little lighter now.
Keys suggested the newly-minted grand slam champion would be buying drinks to console her at a celebration party planned in New York later in the evening. The Telegraph

Aloysius has lied to COPE committee - Palisena
Perpetual Treasuries Limited Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena yesterday stated that PTL owner Arjun Aloysius has lied to the COPE sub-committee investigating into the Treasury bond issue with regards to his involvement in the operational activities of PTL.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake took Palisena through a series of questions with regard to certain statements made by Aloysius to the COPE sub-committee on his resignation from the post of PTL CEO and his involvement in the daily activities of the PTL.
According to the statement given by Aloysius to COPE sub-committee, he stepped down from the post of CEO of the PTL due to the conflict of interests that arose when Arjun Mahendran, his father-in-law, became the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
While pointing out that certain telephone call recordings between Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena reveals that the former was instructing the latter how to and how much to be for at what rates, DSG Gunatilake suggested that Aloysius in that case had lied to the COPE investigation. DSG Gunatilake argued that Aloysius in fact, contrary to his statement to the COPE, involved himself in PTLs day to day activities when it came to dealing and other operational activities. Palisena, who was testifying before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue, initially denied that Aloysius had lied to COPE.
Did not Aloysius involve himself in daily dealing activities of the PTL, as suggested by these telephone call conversations DSG Gunatilake asked. Not always. Only if there is anything important, Palisena replied. Ah, that means Aloysius involved himself only in big things DSG Gunatilake queried. Palisena then said Aloysius did involve himself with PTL trading activities, but not always and regularly.
DSG Gunatilake then asked Palisena, whether or not PTL recorded large profits at certain Treasury bond auctions, by taking trading decisions according to instructions given by Aloysius. Palisena again gave an answer suggesting that Aloysius was not involved with PTL activities regularly. Then, Commissioner Supreme Court Judge,Justice P.S. Jayawardena specifically questioned Palisena whether Aloysiuss involvement in PTL activities was of an operational nature, to which Palisena did not give a clear answer.
Justice Jayawardena then asked Palisena to read out another portion of the testimony given by Aloysius to COPE, where Aloysius explains that had he been involved in PTL trading activities, it definitely would have been in operational activities. He was then asked to consider his answer according to what Aloysius told the COPE investigation. Palisena seemed unconvinced that Aloysiuss involved himself in PTL activities on a daily basis.
Palisena repeated another He (Aloysius) was involved but not always. to the suggestion.
Following Palisenas reply, Chairman of the commission Supreme Court Judge, Justice K.T. Chitrasiri observed that It is very difficult to get an answer from you! referring to Kasun Palisena.
Justice Jayawardena then questioned Palisena on the matter at hand.
Justice Jayawardena: Now, dont fool around. When Aloysius said to COPE that he does not involve in operational activities of PTL, was he lying or not
The witness remains silent.
JJ: Do you know the meaning of a lie
The witness still remains silent.
JJ: Did he lie or not
Kasun Palisena: He has.
Following the answer Chairman Justice K.T. Chitrasiri observed that Kasun Palisena took two minutes to answer the question.
DSG Gunatilake also questioned Palisena if Arjun Aloysius was aware of PTL using its customers securities without their consent or awareness for other deals. Palisena denied of such activity.
Palisena was also questioned on another portion of Aloysiuss statement to COPE with regards to his instructions to PTL as he stepped down from his post as CEO. According to Aloysius, he has instructed PTL to act accordingly to the Central Bank regulations when trading in the market. Justice Jayawardena asked Palisena if Aloysius had this instruction in a memo or any other written form. Palisena said no such written memo was given by Aloysius.
JJ: So we are not inclined to believe you that Aloysius actually instructed so. If PTL violated Central Bank regulations, would Aloysius have know about it
Palisena: Necessarily would have.
JJ: Central Bank charges that PTL violated regulations with regards to day to day operations. So Aloysius knew these violations
P: Yes, he would have.
JJ: So was Aloysius deliberately lying
Palisena did not provide a clear answer to the question.
Chairman Justice K.T Chitrasiri in a lighter tone added, This is like husband not knowing what wife does! causing much laughter among those present in the room.
Meanwhile, Palisena also denied knowing anything or to have given instructions to delete telephone call recordings or to crash the voice logger computer of the PTL call recording system. According to Palisena he thought all call recordings were handed over to the investigators of the commission.
Asked if then PTL IT executive Sachit Devatantri is lying about the computer crashing under Palisenas instructions, the witness said he is not aware of IT matters.
DSG Gunatilake pointed out when Salgado testified that Palisena instructed to delete calls and crash the computer, no counsel objected him in this regard. Palisena denied knowing anything about crashing computers and deleting calls.
A telephone conversation between Kasun Palisena and Kavin Karunamoorthy was then played before the commission suggesting that Palisena proposed to fabricate a call requested by the Central Bank for investigation on PTL.
The conversation has taken place in November 2015, regarding a certain deal. In the conversation, Palisena seemingly proposes Karunamoorthy that Api wena (call) ekak karamuda because there is much slang incorporated in the initial call conversation.
Palisena denied that he was suggesting fabricating a call conversation in place of the original. He also denied knowing PTL call recording systems having the ability to record the call information such as time and caller ID. DSG Gunatilake pointed out that Palisena among thousands of call recordings, has identified and given to the Central Bank specific call recordings by using date, time and caller ID which is contrary to his affidavit to the Treasury Bond Commission. DSG Gunatilake called Palisena an unrepentant liar and suggested that Palisena lied to the Treasury Bond Commission. Palisena said he denied the suggestion made by DSG Gunatilake.
The commission several time requested Palisena to answer truthfully to questions put to him. Justice Jayawardena went on to say Mr. Palisena, at least out of courtesy, try to make it believable when you are lying! Palisena however was adamant that he was not lying.
It was also revealed before the Commission that Palisena receives a nine digit bonus from his company. Justice Jayawardena asked if Palisena had a personal interest in the well being of PTL, when proving PTL has done nothing wrong in the Treasury bond issue, to which Palisena answered in a reluctant affirmation.
When asked about a reference to a payment of Rs. 1 million to a little Jhonny as a boss payment, Palisena said the said Little Jhonny could be anybody. He went on to say that it is a term like podiyan which they used for small customers or dealers they are transacting with.
DSG Gunatilake: So who is little Jhonny
Palisena: Little Jhonny can be anyone!
DSG: Can I suggest to you that there is a limit to lying
Palisena: Ah
DSG: Oh, you think there is no limit to lying!
The Commission will sit again on Monday (18).

Anyika Onuora: From malaria to Olympic medallist in 10 months
When British sprinter Anyika Onuora took some time off to visit family in Nigeria in October 2015, she expected it to be like every other holiday.
But the 32-year-old contracted malaria and unable to walk, her Rio Olympic dream was left hanging in the balance.
Just 10 months later the Liverpudlian stood on the Olympic podium, with a bronze medal in the 4x400m relay hanging round her neck.
Not even her team-mates knew about the life-threatening ordeal she had endured just to be there. Now 13 months on from the Games, she tells her story...
A HOLIDAY TO NIGERIA
There was a pause and the consultant just gave me the look - the look of uncertainty. He didnt know whether Id make a full recovery.
Youre lucky to be alive, he said.
But all I could think was can I leave Ive got an Olympics to train for. I felt like my dream was being taken away from me and it was heart breaking.
It all started when I was in Nigeria - I contracted malaria but I didnt know I had it. I went to the Dominican Republic for another holiday and that was when my symptoms started to get really rough.
I emailed the doctor at British Athletics and I told him my urine was dark, really really dark.
Are you sure its not alcohol or you havent been drinking and staying hydrated he asked. But I was hydrated and it was getting quite worrying.
Even with the symptoms, I got home from the Dominican Republic and I went back to training at Loughborough. I was in denial for a long time. But I knew I wasnt running properly and I felt weird. Thats when I realised it was something much more serious. As soon as I stopped that session, the fever kicked in.
I went to get a urine and a blood test and within 12 hours the chief medical officer got back to me. Theres something wrong with your kidneys, you need to see a specialist, he said.
I had no way to get to London other than to drive myself, with a raging fever, to St Johns Hospital.
LEARNING TO WALK AGAIN
I sometimes complain about doing a tough workout but the symptoms I had were beyond anything
I could have imagined.
I had a fever, I had vomiting, stomach cramps and headaches. I was going from hot to cold, shivering, and waking up in a pool of sweat without knowing why it had happened or where it had come from.
By the time they diagnosed me and told me I had malaria my fever was reaching 40C and they said we need to throw you in an ice tub, but I couldnt move, I could barely breathe.
The nurse had to put bags of ice around the bed because I couldnt get to the tub - I was in so much pain.
I was then put in quarantine and I wasnt allowed to leave. I couldnt even go outside and I remember gazing out the window and thinking how amazing London looked. I didnt know if I was ever going to see fresh air again.
I also had to learn to walk again. When I was moved to the ward I tried to do laps and I was fighting with the nurses because they said I should be in bed resting. But I needed to walk, I needed some sort of movement, I needed to be active - this was my winter training, I should have been out on the track.
The day I got released from hospital, it was my birthday and as soon as I walked outside I took a deep breath of air. I was so thankful to have the opportunity to do that, because not many people are able to survive it.
I think if I was a regular person I wouldnt have known it was malaria. I would have just taken some tablets and thought it was a cold.
They told me if Id have left it a day or two days later it could have been fatal. Im thankful that I caught it as early as I did.
GETTING BACK ON TRACK
I went through the absolute worst in that hospital and I nearly had everything taken away.
But as soon as I could walk again, I started running. No matter how much the training sessions killed me, I was just so grateful to be there.
Originally the European Championships werent in my plans before the 2016 Rio Olympics, but because of the circumstances that led to my performances at the national championships - the Olympic trials - I had to go to the Europeans in Amsterdam to get a medal.
So nine months after contracting malaria I won my first global individual medal - a bronze in the 400m before gold in the 4x400m relay.
That didnt get me an individual place at Rio 2016 but I was selected for the relay and I said Im not coming back to the UK without an Olympic medal.
And in August, I got everything Id ever dreamed of.
Alongside my team-mates Christine Ohuruogu, Emily Diamond and Eilidh Doyle we won bronze in the 4x400m relay.
I remember shaking on the podium. Id been at the Europeans and got a medal, been to the Commonwealths and the World Championships in Beijing, but an Olympic medal It was amazing. You just want to stare at it and hold it, its like a new born child that youve just created and you dont want to let go.
KEEPING A SECRET
Only a handful of people knew what had happened to me in the months building up to the Olympics. I told 400m runner Martin Rooney because we were training partners and I also told long jumper Shara Proctor.
I didnt know how people would react so I decided to keep the fact Id had malaria a secret, even from my 4x400m relay team-mates.
I am always accountable for everything I do and if I had a bad race in 2016 I didnt want anyone to use the malaria as an excuse. I just wanted to focus on the season and not think about it.
Even when I got the Olympic medal, I wasnt too sure about telling people - I felt exposed at the time but the response when I finally did was amazing and completely overwhelming.
Sometimes I still get nightmares about what happened in the hospital. I didnt want to have to remember it but speaking about it gives me a sense of relief and closure.
THE FUTURE
I am now an ambassador for Malaria No More UK - an amazing charity who are bringing the disease to the forefront. Theyre teaching people that this is a global disease and not just in Africa.
People are sometimes worried about going to Africa because of Malaria but Nigeria is like home for me and I love going back - its where my parents were born and bred. After my dad passed away in 2012 I said Id go back as often as possible and I might even retire there one day.
I know many people who have passed away from Malaria. I have a cousin who died from the disease so it makes me truly grateful that I survived and am able to tell my story.
In terms of my performances on the track, Im not in exactly the same shape as before. Over the last two years my times have been up and down, but I dont think thats related to malaria. Im just feeling my way with the 400m.
Im definitely capable of running as quick as I have done in the past and malaria by no means is going to stop me. The biggest thing I took away from this experience is strength, strength I never knew I had.
Weve got the Commonwealth Games in the Gold Coast and the European Championships in Germany next year so hopefully there are more medals to come.  BBC

Body of British journalist killed by crocodile found
Police yesterday found the body of a 24-year-old British journalist, Paul McClean, who is suspected to have been killed by a crocodile.
Divers found McCleans body in the mud of a lagoon in the coastal village of Panama, 360 kilometres east of Colombo by road, a Police spokesman said.
There were six or seven wounds on his right leg, a police official told AFP by telephone. The body was stuck in mud at about the same place where he was seen last by some others who were with him. A crocodile is believed to have dragged McClean away on Thursday afternoon, the officer said.
But a post-mortem examination later Friday would formally establish the cause of death.
British media reports said McClean, who worked for the Financial Times, was holidaying in Sri Lanka with friends. He was on a beach and had wandered away to find a toilet when he stumbled into an area known to be infested with crocodiles. Other holidaymakers in the area alerted Police after McClean disappeared and a search was mounted with the help of navy divers. Crocodile attacks are rare in Sri Lanka. However, earlier this month, wildlife authorities reported that a crocodile had seriously injured a wild elephant in the south of the island.
During monsoon floods in May, authorities warned people in inundated areas to beware of stray crocodiles. - AFP

Essex on brink of County Championship title
LONDON: Essex moved to within touching distance of their first English County Championship title in 25 years after they beat Warwickshire by an innings and 56 runs at Edgbaston on Thursday.
Victory for the visitors meant Essex, only promoted to the First Division at the start of this season, will be crowned champions if Lancashire fail to win away to Somerset on Friday's final day of four.
Given Lancashire were 247 for eight in their second innings after following on at the end of the third day -- a lead of just 45 runs with two wickets standing -- only an extraordinary turn of events in Taunton will stop Essex winning their first Championship title since 1992 on Friday.
Prolific Essex wicket-takers Simon Harmer (four for 25) and Jamie Porter (three for 37), who shared 15 wickets in the match, again did the damage as Warwickshire, bottom of the First Division, slumped to 112 all out.
Essex captain Ryan ten Doeschate said his side's success this season proved the gap between the First and Second Divisions of the first-class County Championship was not as wide as often suggested by many pundits.
"There's not much difference and it's one of the myths I hope we've dispelled this year," said the Dutchman as he reflected on the season enjoyed by Essex, based in Chelmsford, east of London.
"Teams coming up don't necessarily have to go down," said ten Doeschate of an Essex side who were boosted by contributions earlier in the campaign from former England captain Alastair Cook -- still a Test-match opening batsman -- and Pakistan paceman Mohammad Amir.
"It's foolish to look at past records. You need to look at the team and the players you've got. By putting yourself in the position of fearing the change -- it doesn't help anyone.
"The myth of the big gap between the divisions got in our heads a little bit at the start."

Expedite kidney disease eradication - President
Staff shortage to run forty available dialysis machines:
President Maithripala Sirisena has focused his attention on eradicating the spreading kidney disease in the North Central Province.
The North Central Provincial Health Services Director and staff appraised the President, ministers and senior healthcare authorities about the gravity of the situation, the shortcomings in disease prevention programmes and immediate medical care requirements in the NCP during the Presidents recent official tour to Horowpothana.
Action will be taken to provide sufficient trained staff including doctors and nurses to Kebithigollewa, Thambuttegama, Medawachchiya, Medirigiriya and Hingurakgoda hospitals where kidney disease treatment units with 40 dialysis machines are available. The machines are not functioning due to the dearth of staff.
Provincial Health Services Director Dr. Palitha Bandara referring to the spread of the kidney disease told the Daily News that testing blood samples of those less than 20 years in the NCP will be accelerated. He said already the first round of blood tests of 390,000 people have been completed and around 8,000 persons are suspected of falling prey to the disease are being referred for further clinical tests.
According to him, in the Anuradhapura district alone, blood tests of 600,000 persons are required to be done under this programme.
We are planning to strengthen mobile blood testing units at grassroot level with the assistance of available staff including medical health officers and are waiting for more healthcare facilities through the Presidential Secretariat and the Health Ministry to complete this task by 2020. It is our aim to stop the increase in the number of kidney patients which is now at the rate of 4,000 or more per year. However, the death rate of kidney patients is decreasing. Carrying out extensive and intensive medical care programmes, doing away with poisonous agro-chemicals, taking to carbonic cultivation and making potable drinking water available are measures instrumental in curbing the menace, Dr. Palitha Bandara said.

Final copy of Interim Report on Constitutional Reforms Okayed by Steering Committee
After months of deliberations and contentious arguments behind closed door meetings, the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly last week approved the final copy of its Interim Report on Constitutional Reforms.
A member of the Steering Committee confirming that the report is ready for submission said the Constitutional Assembly has been summoned to meet on September 21 at 9.30 a.m. for that purpose.
A copy of the report will be handed over to President Maithripala Sirisena.
The interim report, which deals with the vital aspects of Constitutional reforms including the electoral reforms, devolution of power and nature of the State, spells out the contours of Constitutional Bill.
The Interim Report will be tabled along with the observations made by various parties. Accordingly, the observations of the Joint Opposition, SLFP, TNA, JHU and JVP have been included into the report as annexes. The report also consists of a separate collective document submitted by the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA), Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) and Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP). Constitutional Lawyer Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne has given his own submissions in the report. The UNP has not made a separate submission as the party agrees with the report in its entirety. It is learnt that observations made by various parties indicate contradictory and clashing views on core issues related to the Constitution. While the SLFP has sought to retain the Executive Presidency, the JVP insists on its abolition. While the TNA is bent on a federal solution within an undivided and indivisible country, the JO is adamant on preserving the clause on unitary state. It is now time for hard bargaining. These views are not fixed positions. Nothing is cast in stone. The challenge is to hammer out an agreement cutting across all parties through compromise and negotiation, the Steering Committee member said.
Sources said a date for the debate on the interim report would be fixed after its submission and the Steering Committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would go ahead with drafting the Constitutional Bill based on the proposals and suggestions coming out of this debate.
The Steering Committee which conducted its first meeting on April 5, 2016 has so far conducted over 70 meetings. The Constitutional Assembly formed following a resolution passed unanimously in Parliament in March last year has so far conducted four sittings.
In the meantime, the reports of six sub-committees on Fundamental Rights, Judiciary, Finance, Public Service, Law and Order, Centre-Periphery were presented to the Constitutional Assembly by the Prime Minister on November 19. A three-day debate on Constitutional reforms initially scheduled from January 9 was postponed indefinitely as there was no consensus among the political parties.

A four-year-old girl has fallen victim to the power cuts experienced in many parts of the country as a result of the strike launched by CEB employees.
The girl was given the wrong cough medicine in the dark.
On Thursday (14) night, the family experienced a power cut in their home in Kattaparichchan in Sampur. The victim, Sivanetthin Parsin was suffering from a cold at the time and her mother, in the dark found a bottle thought to be paracetamol to give to her child. The little girl soon after had complained of a stomach ache and her father having suspected something to be wrong with the medicine and had tasted it himself. It is then that the parents had noticed that it was not paracetamol and they had rushed their daughter to the Muttur hospital. As the girls condition worsened, they transferred her to the Trincomalee General Hospital but she did not respond to the treatment and died soon after.
The father too is receiving treatment for having ingested the poison but his condition is not serious.
Sampur Police is conducting further investigations into the case.
In a separate incident, the power cut in Hingurakgoda resulted in the death of the Public Health Inspector, M.P. Sunil Karunaratne (56).
Karunaratne who had been brought to the Hingurakgoda Hospital suffering from a heart attack could not be treated at the hospital due to the power cut. He was then being transferred to the Polonnaruwa Hospital wherein he died.
Karunaratne was attached to the Hingurakgoda Public Health Department at the time of his death.

Graeme Swann on the Jimmy Anderson you dont see
Its fitting that James Anderson is the first England bowler to take 500 Test wickets.
Not only is he Englands best ever, but he was also born to bowl. Hes a phenomenal talent in so many ways.
I want to say hes a club swinger who got lucky - similar to what he says about me as a spinner - but his talent is all natural.
He likes his records and milestones and is aware of his numbers at each ground, but his main drive is simply to take wickets. And to be grumpy while doing so.
I find it bizarre when commentators say he could do better. Hes always got a plan and is often so patient in his execution of those plans that he could be a spinner.
Hell angle three deliveries across a batsman and the commentator will be screaming for him to nip one back. But he bides his time, almost waiting until the batsman thinks hes not got one that goes the other way, and then hell produce it and take a wicket.
Hes got incredible control of the cricket ball.
Jimmys a supreme athlete who, despite being 35, still has the body of a 21-year-old. Im not sure how, though, because hes got the worst diet of any professional athlete I know.
The only things he eats are pizzas and burgers, yet hes so lithe and loose. Hes like a whippet - theres more meat on a dirty fork.
He also has a brilliant knack of annoying batsmen. I remember during one particular Ashes series he would refer to Mike Hussey as Dave, his brother.
When he saw him in the morning, itd be: Morning Dave. After a delivery: Shot, Dave. Mid-innings: Keep going, Dave.
Eventually, Hussey snapped and replied: Im not Dave. Im Mike.
Anderson just smiled: Sorry, Dave.
Imagine how annoying that would have been for Hussey for an entire series. It was entertaining for us, thats for sure.
Jimmy likes to be angry and gets fired up for everything he does. The only time he fell out with me was when I laughed after Tim Bresnan scored a great goal against him in the last minute of a computer game on tour.
He lost the plot, ignored me for days - including on the field when he wouldnt even look at me - then, almost as quickly as he snapped, gave me a big cuddle and said sorry.
While we appear to be different characters at first, were so similar we could be brothers. Hes such a good friend, Id literally do anything for him.
Obviously, Id be the good-looking brother. I like to wind him up about some modelling he did for an advert which is on the back of a fleet of buses.
The advert refers to him as the worlds second best bowler. Why not just go with Englands best bowler I like it anyway because I can say hes got a face like the back of a bus.
We often travelled together to Tests and one particular day we had to follow a diversion to Lords. Im superstitious and because I took five wickets that day, Jimmy - my passenger - was happy to repeat the journey the next day even though we were borderline late.
He has great taste in music and made sure the tracks were exactly the same too, and we sat in the car listening to the White Lies Farewell to the Fairground. We were parked up at Lords and couldnt get out of the car until it was over.
One thing I always admire is his desire to play for Lancashire.
When youre an international bowler with a decent record, youre almost given licence to pick and choose the games you need to be ready for the first Test of each summer.
While Id pick two of three matches to play in, Jimmy would want to play in them all. He loves nothing more than trying to win games for Lancashire and picking a fight with the Yorkshire captain.
He is 35 now, but hes in such good shape that I wouldnt rule out him playing until hes 40. In that respect, hes the Floyd Mayweather of English cricket.
Like the brilliant American boxer, in his particular discipline - and certainly for this country - hes the best theres been. BBC

Heavy rains increase Kalu Ganga water levels
Heavy rainfall in the Kalutara district has resulted in a rapid increase in the water levels of Kalu Ganga. As a result, many low-lying areas in the district have been inundated.
The Disaster Management Centre has also issued landslide warnings to nine Divisional Secretariats in the Kalutara District and the public have been warned to be vigilant in these areas.
The areas are Bulathsinhala, Yatagampitiya, Delmella, Pasgoda, Palindanuwara, Agalawatte, Ingiriya, Walallavita and Mathugama.
On Wednesday evening, the Kukuleganga spill gates were opened affecting those living downstream in Agalawatte, Bulathsinhala, Ingiriya and Madurawala.
The rains over the past few days have caused havoc in the district with sectors such as farming, fishing and rubber cultivation coming to a complete standstill.
The districts vegetable cultivations too have been greatly affected as a result of the rain.

Inland Revenue Act to be effective from next April 1
The Inland Revenue Act (IRA) will come into effect from April 1, 2018, the Finance Ministry issuing a press release said.
The release said the capital gain tax, remittance tax, withholding tax and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax which were scheduled to come into effect from October 2017, would come into effect in April next year.
The release said the decision was made to avoid complications arising from having to keep two sets of accounts to implement the Act in two ways. The new tax collection date was set by the Treasury, as advised by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera. The minister said reports that new sectors would come under taxation were false and that the Inland Revenue Department, Trade unions and all parties in Parliament have been consulted and their suggestions included in the final Act.
He refuted reports that religious institutions, foreign remittances or the interest payments of senior citizens would be liable for tax.
Interest incomes on deposits of senior citizens have a tax exemption up to Rs. 125,000 per month. A senior citizen should own a deposit exceeding Rs.15 million to be liable to tax.
The new system has simplified the tax system and removed other concessions granted to various individuals and companies.
The release states that under the new IRA, the annual limit for exemptions of PAYE tax has been increased from Rs. 750,000 to Rs. 1.2 million, which frees a fragment of employees liable to PAYE from the new financial year.
Companies listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange and the profits from trading stocks are not liable to capital gains tax. EPF is not liable to tax under the new IRA. The new IRA has not imposed taxes on the service fees of hospitals. Private hospitals are liable to tax as companies.
This tax was increased from 12 to 28 percent of the profits a hospital makes at the end of the financial year.
This would not result in an increase of hospital charges on patients.

The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday claimed to have collected close to Rs. 1.5 million in their first day of the Pindapatha programme launched by the Buddhist monks in Colombo.
The monks engaged in the practice to collect money to pay the fine of former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga and former Director General of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Anusha Pelpita. JO Member and UPFA MP Gamini Lokuge speaking to the Daily News, said that over 350 Buddhist monks participated in the programme. The next programme is to be held next Sunday at Kiribathgoda.
Lokuge said they had appealed the Court order on the Sil cloth case and that the people should help collect money to pay their total fine of Rs. 100 million as a service to these government officers.

Karunaratne propels BMS, Sri Lanka into the finals
Business Management School (BMS), Sri Lanka emerged victorious in a last-ball finish against University of Sydney, Australia.
The hosts hero was 21-year-old seam-bowling all rounder Chamika Karunaratne, who after having hit a valuable 33 off 29 balls, delivered an accurate final over, conceding only nine runs when Australia needed 14 to win. The final delivery  a perfect yorker  sparked jubilation on the field,
University of, Sydney needed four off that final delivery to score the 164 that would have seen them progress to the final. It was a dot ball. At one stage it seemed like Sydneys chase had been halted by Sri Lankas disciplined seamers.
Though opener Hayden Kerr had struck 54 off 27 balls, the remaining top order batsmen failed to find the boundary, as the Sri Lankan bowlers delivered a succession of tight overs.
They had needed 67 runs off the last 36 balls, before Will Lawrence and Joseph Kershaw started hitting out. Even their rapid 48-run stand could not get Sydney across the line,
However. Sri Lanka themselves had been in trouble in their innings, with the first four wickets falling for a mere14 runs. Karunaratne put together a 54-run stand with Supeshala Jayathilake, who went on to top-score with 50 off 41 balls. Tilaksha Sumanasiri also hit 40 not out off 22 balls as Sri Lanka reached 163 for 6 in their 20 overs.

Lankas health system passes many milestones: Minister Dr. Senaratne
Sri Lanka achieved notable improvements in the health system, such as receiving certification for the eradication of Malaria, adoption of a migration health policy, and the multi-pronged fight against NCDs by improving access to NCD screening and care through Primary Care, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the 70th Session of the WHO Regional Committee for South East Asia held in Male, Maldives recently, the minister said providing cardiac stents and intraocular lenses free of charge for those being treated at government hospitals and the reduction of the price of 48 commonly used drugs facilitating equitable access to medication among notable improvements.
Addressing another event, the minister said Sri Lanka as a country which has enjoyed universal health coverage for almost six decades, has managed to achieve impressive health indicators, especially in the areas of maternal and child health and addressing communicable diseases, supported by nearly 100 percent immunisation coverage.
Minister Senaratne said Sri Lanka has been successful in achieving polio free status way back in 1993 followed by lymphatic filariasis last year.
The country is targeting on the elimination of Rabies, mother to child transmission of HIV, measles and congenital rubella by 2020. Sri Lanka has a fairly low viral hepatitis burden below two percent.
The country can continue with this scenario by strengthening the routine immunisation programme which includes three doses of the hepatitis B vaccine, soon to be boosted with a birth dose of the vaccine based on expert opinion, he said.

Meet the world's strongest man, who dodged death to lift 500kg
This is what happened to Eddie Hall when he broke the world dead-lift record. He was on stage at the Leeds Arena in April 2016, faced with lifting 500 kilograms, roughly the weight of a fully-grown polar bear. Three men were competing to see if they could do it. The first competitor tore his hamstring in the warm-up and never lifted a thing. The second ruptured something major in his first attempt. Then Hall stepped forward and, with a roar, hoisted the steel bar as it bent under its colossal, half-tonne load. As the 11,000-strong audience cheered him, he fainted. He woke up on the floor, with blood seeping out of his mouth, his nose, his eyes.
My blood pressure was well over 200, he recalls. It could have killed me. He had proved himself the Roger Bannister of dead-lifting, breaking a record long deemed beyond human capability, and nearly died in the process. It might be thought by most of us a good point to stop. But for Hall that was just the start. Now he has set himself on a path to become the biggest draw in British sport. And after that, if his manager Mo Chaudry has his way, to use his renown to bring peace to the worlds trouble spots.
He can tour the world, spreading the goodwill, says Chaudry. I really believe that people will come together with him. He could be a phenomenon. First, though, there was a small matter Hall needed to resolve.
When I said I was going to lift 500 kilos, everybody laughed their heads off, he says, as he sits sipping a protein shake in the Stoke gym where he trains. Well, I did it. But there was one thing I needed to do to cement that achievement: I had to win the title of the worlds strongest man.
For years, the Worlds Strongest Man has been a staple of the Christmas television schedule. Generations of us have been brought up on the sight of freakishly contoured, usually Scandinavian, giants engaging in ridiculous strength challenges like pulling jetliners or flipping tractor tyres. Hall had watched the competition as a boy, dreaming one day the title might be his.
For me, theres two things to call yourself, he says. Either the worlds fastest man or the worlds strongest man. I was never going to be the fastest. But I could be the strongest. Its the most alpha-male title on the planet. Brought up in the Potteries, Hall had been a champion freestyle swimmer in his youth. When he was 15, installed on the Olympic development programme, however, he walked out of the pool, fed up of the demands of coaches. Soon after, he was excluded from school.

Milk Fish to replace baitfish from China
The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has taken measures to promote Milk Fish, known in Sinhala as Wekkaya as an alternative for baitfish import from China.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera directed relevant officials to provide relief for those who are willing to breed the local fish variety called Wekkaya as an alternative for the Chinese baitfish variety.
The minister said the price of cuttlefish variety imported from China to use as bait has increased rapidly during the past few months.
Although fishermen have requested to reduce the price, the ministry cannot do so as tax has not been imposed on the Chinese baitfish variety, said the minister. Accordingly, the ministry has decided to provide financial assistance of Rs. 500,000 and a land for them. Measures have also been taken to provide loans at concessionary rates through a State bank.
The minister said a land from Balapitiya close to Madu Ganga and another land from Chilaw have already been identified as suitable lands for breeding the baitfish.
The ministry has also decided to give priority to the fisher community when they select beneficiaries with the intention of enhancing living standards, said the minister.

More relief for fishermen in Budget 2018
The government is ready to provide more facilities and relief for the fishery community from the Budget 2018, enabling them to increase their income using modern technologies, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
A cabinet paper has also been submitted seeking approval to include a proposal on the implementation of mechanism to purchase fishing vessels with modern technology and also to give relief to for fishery community in the 2018 Budget Proposals, the Minister said.
The Minister was participating at the launch of two new fishing vessels equipped with latest facilities by Richwin Ceylon Fisheries on Thursday at Dikowita Fishery Harbour.
"Even though we inherit a sea eight times larger than the land area, 116 lagoons and 10,000 reservoirs in the country, we have become incapable of catching fish adequate for domestic consumption due to the absence of latest technology by our fishermen.As a result of that, imported fish and canned fish brought here last year was 112,000 metric tonnes,the Minister said.
"With the introduction of fishing vessels equipped with modern technologies we will be able to reduce post harvest losses, he said.Around 40 percent of the fish harvest cannot be used for consumption due to the post harvest losses," he added.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Deputy Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi also participated.

National Coastal and Marine Resources Conservation Week from Sept 15 to 22
The national event on the National Coastal and Marine Resources Conservation Week and Coastal Cleanup Programme, organised by the Marine Environment Protection Authority and the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resources Management, is held at Crow Island Beach Park, Mattakkuliya from September 15 to 22 with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Marine Environment Protection Authority Chairman Rear Admiral (Rtd) Rohana Perera said the risk of pollution of the ocean around Sri Lanka is on the rise daily due to the impact of heavily used pollutants emanating from various development activities and increasing population.
The threat of pollution pressure is alarming with around 65 percent urban population pressure and about 70 percent organized industries concentrated in the Sri Lankan coastal zone. Large quantities of non-degradable waste generated from the land wind up in the coastal and marine zones directly or through the waterways. This is bound to adversely affect industries such as fisheries and tourism that are closely linked to the sensitive marine environment system as well as to the ocean, Perera said.
By considering all these facts, President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Mahaweli Development and Environment Minister, made a proposal to declare National Marine Resources Conservation Week in September.
The Cabinet has approved the proposal and the National Marine Resources Conservation Week will be held in September each year to coincide with International Coastal Cleanup Day that falls on the third Saturday of September each year.
Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department Director General B. K. Prabath Chandrakeerthi said Sri Lanka has a coastline of about 1,700 km polluted immensely due to various activities. Arrangements have been made to protect the marine environmental system including the coastal belt and nearly 82 lagoons during the National Marine Resources Conservation Week.
Under this programme, coastal cleanup programmes will be held at 75 locations in 14 districts. Programmes will also be launched to cleanup coral reefs and mangroves with the participation of schoolchildren and teachers, government officials, officers in Divisional Secretariat offices, Provincial Environment Ministries and representatives of environmental organizations.
During this project, all non-degradable and degradable waste will be collected and they will be properly disposed or directed to recycling projects.
Marine Environment Protection Authority General Manager Dr. Terney Pradeep Kumara said that Sri Lanka is ranked number five in the Global Pollution Rankings Index. The problem in terms of marine pollution in Sri Lanka is due to plastics, polythene and solid waste products arising from tourism, fisheries and other sectors.
Therefore, Sri Lankans should act responsibly to reduce this.

North Korea replies to SANCTIONS with another MISSILE
SOUTH KOREA: North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan and into the Pacific Friday, responding to new UN sanctions with what appeared to be its furthest-ever missile flight amid high tensions over its weapons programmes.
The launch, from near Pyongyang, came after the United Nations Security Council imposed an eighth set of measures on the isolated country over its ballistic missile and atomic weapons programmes.
That followed its sixth nuclear test -- by far its largest yet -- earlier this month, which Pyongyang said was a hydrogen bomb small enough to fit onto a missile.
In New York, the Security Council called an emergency meeting for later Friday.
The US Pacific Command confirmed Friday's rocket was an intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) and said it did not pose a threat to North America, or to the US Pacific territory of Guam, which Pyongyang has threatened to bracket with enveloping fire.
Seoul's defence ministry said it probably travelled around 3,700 kilometres and reached a maximum altitude of 770 kilometres.
It was the furthest overground any of their ballistic missiles has ever travelled, Joseph Dempsey of the International Institute for Strategic Studies said on Twitter.
It was a clear indication North Korea has range - not necessarily accuracy - to follow through (the) Guam plan, he added.
The North has raised global tensions with its rapid progress in weapons technology under leader Kim Jong-Un, who is closely associated with the programme and regularly pictured by state media overseeing launches and visiting facilities.
The North's last missile launch, a Hwasong-12 IRBM just over two weeks ago, also overflew Japan's main islands and was the first to do so for years.
But when Pyongyang tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July that appeared to bring much of the US mainland into range, it fired them on lofted trajectories that avoided passing over the archipelago nation.
The North is sending a message which is, 'we are not cowering before any sanctions and our warnings are not empty threats', Yang Moo-Jin of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul told AFP.
It has vowed the US would face 'pain and suffering' in retaliation for the UN sanctions.
Millions of Japanese were jolted awake by blaring sirens and emergency text message alerts after the missile was fired.
Missile launch! missile launch! A missile appears to have been launched from North Korea, loudspeakers blared on Cape Erimo, on Hokkaido's southern tip.
Breakfast television programmes, which usually broadcast a light-hearted diet of children's shows and gadget features, instead flashed up the warning: Flee into a building or a basement. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Tokyo could never tolerate what he called a dangerous provocative action that threatens world peace.
If North Korea continues to walk down this path, it has no bright future, he told reporters. We must make North Korea understand this. Tokyo had protested to Pyongyang in the strongest words possible, chief government spokesman Yoshihide Suga added.
The missile overflew Japan for around two minutes, reports said, but there were no immediate indications of objects falling onto Japanese territory.
The launch came a day after a North Korean organisation warned of a telling blow against Japan, accusing it of dancing to the tune of the US for supporting fresh UN sanctions.
The four islands of the archipelago should be sunken into the sea by the nuclear bomb of Juche, the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee (KAPPC) said in a statement, referring to the North's national philosophy of Juche or self-reliance.
In response, South Korea's military immediately carried out a ballistic missile drill of its own on Friday in the East Sea, Korea's name for the Sea of Japan, the defence ministry said.
The Hyunmu missile travelled 250 kilometres -- a trajectory intentionally chosen to represent the distance to the launch site at Sunan, near Pyongyang's airport, it added.
President Moon Jae-In called an emergency meeting of Seoul's national security council, a standard procedure after the North fires a missile or tests a nuclear device.
The United Nations Security Council sanctions imposed on Monday are the strongest so far, banning the North's textile trade and imposing restrictions on shipments of oil products, among a series of other measures.
But analysts expect them to do little to dissuade Pyongyang, which says it needs nuclear weapons to defend itself against the threat of invasion by the US.
Earlier this year US President Donald Trump threatened it with fire and fury, heightening fears of conflict. - AFP

One person killed every hour in accidents
National Accident Prevention Week:
One person is killed every hour and 27 die daily in Sri Lanka due to various types of accidents. This includes road traffic and other accidents.
Annually, 10,000 persons die due to accidents in Sri Lanka, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministrys Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) Unit Director Dr. Thilak Siriwardana said. According to Dr. Siriwardana, every year, four million Sri Lankans need to seek medical treatment for accident-related injuries and one in every five Sri Lankans seek medical treatment for the same. Four hundred and eighty persons become accident victims every hour. A total of 11,000 become accident victims daily.
Dr. Thilak Siriwardana was addressing the media during a health seminar at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo, yesterday.
Dr. Siriwardana pointed out that accidental deaths are at the 11th place out of hospital deaths. Around 10,000 persons die from various accidents every year and 3,000 out of them die due to road traffic accidents. Another 1,000 drown.
The government spends a large amount of money to treat accident victims. The most number of accidents are related to animal bites. The second highest number of accidents is due to falls.
The National Accident Prevention Week will be held from September 18 to 22 island-wide.
The first day of the week is allocated to road traffic accident prevention while the second day is allocated to workplace accident prevention. The third day of the week will focus on preventing accidents at home.
The fourth day will focus on preventing accidents taking place at pre- schools. The final day of the National Accident Prevention Week - September 22 - will be focused on preventing accidents taking place in school premises, he added.

Over 10 people die daily in road accidents
About 10 to 12 people die daily in Sri Lanka due to various road traffic accidents.
About 45 to 50 severe road traffic accidents take place in Sri Lanka every day. In addition, 100 to 125 road traffic accidents take place in the country, Traffic Police Division ASP W.D.A. Dhananjaya said.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo, yesterday, he said in the past, only seven or eight died due to road traffic accidents but now this number has increased to about10 to 12. Over 90 percent of road traffic accidents are connected to motorcycles.
The second highest number of accidents is related to three wheelers.
Most accident victims are between the ages of 15 and 40. The most number of accidental deaths occur between the ages 40 and 70.
There are 3.8 million motorcycles and 1.1 million three wheelers in the country.
In addition, there are seven million registered vehicles in the country and six million run on the roads which are 98,000 kilometers long, Dhananjaya said. Around 40,000 road traffic accidents take place annually in Sri Lanka and between 2,500 and 3,000 persons die from them.
Last year, a total of 3,020 deaths were reported due to road traffic accidents.
Ignorance, carelessness, not paying attention and not having the required knowledge are the four main reasons for road traffic accidents, Dhananjaya added.

Over 400 killed in train accidents last year
A total of 405 persons were killed due to train accidents last year. During the past eight months, over 300 persons were killed due to train accidents, Railway Security Department officials said.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, they said two persons died during the past 24 hours. One person committed suicide and the other died due to an accident. More than one death is reported, daily. Schoolboys travel on the trains footboards and insult railway security officers when warned, officials said.
Train commuters are more interested in catching a seat than safeguarding their lives. They try to get on to moving trains, fall and die.
This kind of accidents is now being reduced by narrowing the gap between the rail track and platform. However, passengers still behave in a reckless manner, they said.
Train commuters die due to various accidents when they travel between two compartments.
They walk on rail tracks located along the beach while using mobile phones.
They do not hear the sound of the train due to the call and the sound of the sea.
They are often run over by trains. Sometimes, they change the track and jump to the other track to escape from one train and get run over by the other train that comes on the other track, they added.

Pakistan beat World XI to win T20I series
LAHORE: Pakistan beat World XI by a thumping 33 runs in the final Twenty20 Friday to clinch a three-match series which marked the return of international cricket to the country.
Set a target of 184 to win, the World XI only managed 150-8 at Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium to concede the series to the home team by 2-1.
David Miller and Thisara Perera scored 32 each while Hasan Ali took 2-28.
Pakistan opener Ahmed Shehzad had earlier missed his second Twenty20 international century when he fell for 89. His 55-ball knock included eight fours and three sixes.
Babar Azam made a 31-ball 48 with five boundaries and added 102 for the second wicket with Shehzad.
Pakistan won the first match by 20 runs on Tuesday before the World XI fought back with a seven-wicket victory on Wednesday to set up Friday's decider.
There were terrific scenes in Lahore following Pakistans victory. The fans were happy, the dressing room was happy and the coach Mickey Arthur ecstatic.
Pakistan came up with a terrific display of death bowling.
Shortly after the match Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed calls his boys into a huddle does all the talking before his boys roar in delight.
Pakistan came into this series as favourites and have played like one. The euphoria has carried on from their Champions Trophy win.
The World XI weren't any pushovers. There was some serious pedigree in there, but Pakistan have dominated in conditions familiar to them.

Pilleyans book on his LTTE experience launched
Former Eastern Province Chief Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pilleyan who is in remand has written a book describing his experiences in life from the time he was a member of the LTTE organisation.
The launching ceremony of the book titled Wedkei or Sirei Payanna Kurippugal, was held at the Chelvanayakam hall, Batticaloa recently.
Pilleyan said since he has been in remand for two years cut off from the outside world, he wrote the book to overcome his loneliness. Since Pilleyan was not able to attend the launching ceremony, the first copy of the book was presented to Pilleyans parents by Hindu Priest Sri Sivakumar.
Pilleyan is in remand in connection with the alleged murder of former Parliamentarian Joseph Pararajasinghem on December 25,2006.

POWER MINISTRY STANDS FIRM
Casual employees who fail to report for duty would be deemed to have vacated posts :
CEB TU Convenor says they are ready to face consequences :
A defiant Power and Energy Ministry has asked all employees who retired after September 1, 2014 to report to work as the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) trade unions decided to continue their strike for the fourth consecutive day.
The Ministry on Thursday night had warned casual employees and those on probation, that if they did not report to work yesterday (15), the Ministry would consider them to have vacated their posts.
The CEB is estimated to have 4000-5000 employees working on a casual and probationary basis. CEB National Electricity Workers Union Convener Ranjan Jayalal reiterated that no CEB worker would report to work and that they are ready to face the consequences if the Ministry decided to take any action.
He said that they would continue to strike until they receive a favourable response to their demands from Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya.
Jayalal added that as the discussion they had with the Minister and the Ministry Secretary on Thursday (14) was unsuccessful they would continue to strike. CEB cancelled leave of all CEB employees from Wednesday (13) until September 20.
The decision was taken after the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Workers Union announced that they would launch an indefinite strike from Tuesday (12) over several demands including the revision of the salary ratio from 1:6 to 1:9.
They also warned that no repair work will be carried out in the case of a breakdown or power failure except at government hospitals, during the strike.
Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Secretary B.M.S Batagoda said there had been no issues so far and the CEB would continue to function with the available staff.
The Ministry suggested just solutions to their demands but the trade union employees are refusing to accept them.
"We are now taking measures to deal with the issues and so far the situation is under control, he added.

Ranawaka calls for national dialogue on priority development projects
A national dialogue is necessary with regard to which development projects should be given priority, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
He said during the previous regime, priority had been given to many projects that were not beneficial to the country. It would be better if the roads and public transport service were developed rather than spending a large amount of money on expressways.
He made these observations at the groundbreaking ceremony held to construct a building for the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation in Keravalapitiya.
Minister Ranawaka said even now the government attempts to continue some of those projects but the time is ripe to identify the most important projects that should be implemented.
He further said that even now there is a concern on the Uma Oya project, Gin Ganga and Nilwala river projects to provide water to Hambantota.
However, there is an issue of providing water to Colombo and Gampaha districts from 2020 as a new water project or reservoir had not been constructed to provide water to these two districts," said Minister Ranawaka.
On the other hand, the expressway being constructed from Kurunegala to Galagedara saves only 25 minutes. However, it requires around Rs. 200 billion to construct these 39 km expressways including Rs. 144 billion for the constructing company, land acquisition etc. If the same road is developed into a four lane road, the expenditure is only Rs. 10 billion. Minister Ranawaka said the control of overflow of Kelani River, Kalu River and Attanagalu Oya and road development should be given priority.
He added that garbage management should also be given importance. The minister said the Treasury should allocate money for garbage management. If it is not addressed, it would become a menace again, Minister Ranawaka said.
We have more work including low land development, urban housing development, control of flood waters, land development, water management etc. So we cant attend to the garbage issue if the money is not allocated for the same. Land Reclamation and Development Corporation Chairman Asela Iddawela, its acting Director Roshan Gunawardena and General Manager Srimathi Senadheera were also present.

## Title: The religio-political project of Sil Redi
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Saturday, September 16, 2017 - 01:00
The religio-political project of Sil Redi
The judgement by the High Court, Colombo on the Sil Redi issue, apart from the sentence of imprisonment on the former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeeratunga and the former Director General of the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) Anusha Pelpita, is showing signs of moving to a major encounter between the forces of politics and the powers of the judiciary.
The fact that this was the first case involving alleged fraud and corruption under the previous Rajapaksa Regime, has certainly made it an issue with important political impact in the context of the pledge given by the Yahapalana campaigners to make the fight against corruption a key aspect of its policies. It is important to recall that the pledge in that campaign was to fight, expose and bring to book the politicians in that government who were carrying a repulsive image of their involvement in fraud and corruption. What has happened is that two public officers, have been the first to be found guilty. The question now arises as to when the politicians, whatever rank they may have held, and the members of their families and other players in that carnival of corruption would be exposed and brought to book.
Weeratunga and Pelpita have now filed their appeals against the High Court judgement in the Court of Appeal, and have thus gone back to the judiciary in the hope of obtaining acquittals, or a reduction in the convictions, in keeping with the process of law. It is important to bear in mind that the High Court in making its order in this trial was very clear that neither Weeratunga nor Pelpita had personally benefited in any way with the huge sum of Rs. 600 million involved in this exercise of the buying and distribution of Sil Redi, during the campaign of the last presidential election.
While the due process of law would take its course, very clearly demonstrating a major shift towards the independence of the judiciary in the present policies of government, the politics of Sil Redi is showing a new factor for consideration, where the Rajapaksa image, with its known buttress for corruption, is drawing both Weeratunga and Pelpita into the vortex of a crooked political cavalcade, which seeks to hide the strong image of corruption in the Rajapaksa Regime that has come out with this judgement, and carry out a mix of crooked religious with the loud politics of chicanery.
Mahinda Rajapaksa is very loud in his statements about the honesty of Weeratunga in implementing the Sil Redi policy on which he had given directions as the President, with the interest of supporting Buddhist religious activities in the country. He says publicly that he is responsible for the order, and that he has not been queried on the matter.
Religious veil
What he considers a superb tactic, in distorting the administrative realities, and supposedly trying to take the blame away from, especially Weeratunga and also Pelpita, is in fact a contemptible attitude of twisted political manipulation, that appears to shield the two persons convicted for allegedly following his instructions, but is in fact using the Sil Redi as a religious veil to cover his corruption, with little regard, in any, for the situation that he has pushed these two persons into, about whom he is so gladly shedding crocodile tears.
What stands out here is why he and his lawyers had to wait till the trial of the Sil Redi case was over, and the verdict delivered, to come out shouting that it was his order they were implementing; and carrying out a huge political-cum-religious circus to expose what he sees to be the fault of the judiciary, and show his own commitment to serve the religious needs of the Buddhist community through the powers and rights of the Executive Presidency.
It will certainly take much more of this promenade of religio-politics to make the people accept this I am the guiltyif at all crooked yarn. But, there is certainly the danger of this dishonest and corrupt political strategy, leading to some arousal of politically directed and manipulated Buddhist feeling, which has to be met with proper exposure of the truth with regard to the corruption of the Rajapaksa Regime.
This masquerading of honesty in government certainly calls for a stronger approach to the fight against the fraud and corruption of the Rajapaksa Regime. The veil of the Sil cloth should not be allowed to hide any more of the corruption that prevailed at the time Mahinda Rajapaksa says he issued so many orders that had to be implemented by the administration, with no fear of corruption or misdemeanor. The twisted logic of MR even goes to compare the annual distribution of school uniform material to children, with the Sil cloth project or Sil Redi Vyapruthiya as he calls it. He asks if the school uniform distribution would be stopped if an election is held at the end of a year, when that distribution usually takes place.
The simple answer would be that such distribution will have to be stopped if; the uniform package includes a photograph and/or message (even education concerned) by a presidential candidate or any other candidate in an election being held at the time. That is the simple reality.
The political noise that MR and his JO backers may make on this issue, including arousal of religious feelings, moving away from the realities of religion and, the possibility of Sil Redi being used as political bribes, and the various religio-political strategies that will be used with some of the yellow robe, seeks new strategies. The call now is for a more determined fight against corruption. The exposure of the corrupt forces of the past, and those who have moved towards corruption at present is the call of the day; with the advantage that honest public servants will now feel stronger to fight the forces of corruption seeking to use them for their dirty politics and filthy business.
The Eliya  Keliya
While the fight against corruption gained new strength, the political strategies of the defeated forces of corruption have taken a new stride in political organisation, with the launch of the Eliya movement, which does not bring much light as the name indicates, but throws out the so far uncertain candidate for political leadership, from the Rajapaksa family. This is the emergence of the Military cum Administrative hulk, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who has so far been trying to show that he had little interest in politics.
With the definite reality that Mahinda Rajapaksa will not be the next national leader, being kept out of the presidency by the 19th Amendment, the Rajapaksa forces have organised what is seen as a new intellectual leadership, - with academia, diplomats, clergy of different faiths, and professionals who have clearly moved to racist and majoritarian thinking, to present Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as the next leader of the Sinhala majority.
The Gota Eliya exercise was mainly structured on criticism of constitutional changes  especially the proposal for a new Constitution, which has been a key policy issue of the Yahapalanaya alliance. The Eliya makes it clear that they are not in favour of any new constitution, and also oppose constitutional reforms that could lead to a wider democracy, and the progress of the thinking and policies of reconciliation and nation building.
The Eliya drivers must be pleased with the decision of the SLFP to oppose major constitutional reform, and instead only support constitutional amendments that will not remove the Executive Presidency.
The Eliya policies are against constitutional reform, or progress in towards wider democracy that will go against the success of the military victory against the LTTE, attempting to show that any new constitution that is being discussed today, will give to the Tamils, or to the Tamil Diaspora, what the LTTE failed to win in the battlefield. The rays of Eliya are certainly against any widening of the system of devolution introduced with the 13th Amendment.
The strategies of the Eliya are directed towards the expected parliamentary and presidential polls in 2020, and will seek to obtain the support of new voters, not involved in the defeat of the Rajapaksa Regime in January and August 2015. It is certainly an uphill task, but it has hope for success due to the divisions that prevail between the UNP and SLFP. However, there is also the reality of the efforts now being made to bring the SLFP and its inner rivals of the JO to come together, and also the efforts by some to bring both Mahinda Rajapaksa and President Maithripala Sirisena to some understanding in the coming months, especially with local government polls.
Amidst all this complex and tortuous politics Eliya certainly has no easy opening for a Gotabhaya Rajapaksa candidacy for national leadership. Its success will have much more to do with giving the true light to the people on the political and social realities in the county, and not through the darkness of racist and religious extremism that hangs as the backdrop in this new political stage in the country.

## Title: Roads for All
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial
## Date: Saturday, September 16, 2017 - 01:00
Roads for All
Roads connect people and places. They are the lifeblood of any modern economy. We just cannot imagine life without them. Sri Lanka, ranked 121st in the world in terms of size (just 65,610 Sq Km), has the 43rd biggest road network inclusive of unpaved roads. Many bigger, more developed countries rank below Sri Lanka in terms of total road length.
Still, we have a problem. We are literally running out of roads, because they cannot cope with the sheer number of new vehicles being registered every day. There are now more than six million vehicles in circulation and every month, more than 3,000 passenger cars alone enter the roads, not counting other vehicle categories.
Our policy planners have addressed this issue in several ways: Adding expressways for those willing to go faster by paying a reasonable fee, widening and repairing existing roads, building entirely new toll free roads, building flyovers (Rajagiriya, Ganemulla, Polgahawela) and underpasses (Kandy) in busy city junctions and most recently designating bus lanes during morning and evening rush hours. The Ministry of Highways and Higher Education and the Road Development Authority are the lead agencies for these tasks along with the Megapolis Ministry for certain aspects.
But one problem in our part of the world is that projects which begin with much fanfare take ages to complete, due to bureaucratic bungling and red tape, legal and logistical issues, sheer lethargy and sometimes, an element of corruption. This is why periodic reviews of such initiatives are essential.
This is exactly what President Maithripala Sirisena did on Thursday when he met ministers and officials engaged in this sector for a lengthy review and discussion. He rightly emphasized the need for a National Policy on Highways to ensure that there will be no changes from time to time when construction of such roads is being carried out.
The new Government has essentially continued the road projects initiated by the previous one after a thorough review of their financial terms and status. This was a must, given the widespread accusations of corruption and excessive cost estimates in road projects during that period. The new Government did manage to renegotiate the terms of some projects, saving a substantial amount of foreign exchange in the process. Getting local subcontractors for most of the road packages is another victory.
The Government has launched several new expressway and highway projects, some of which are already under construction. President Sirisena inquired regarding ongoing construction work of these expressways and the renovation work of existing major and minor roads.
The gathering was told that the construction of the section from Meerigama to Kurunegala and the section from Kadawatha to Meerigama of the Central Expressway will be completed by September 2019 and 50 percent of the construction work of the section from Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya will be completed by the end of this year. The plan for the Northern Expressway has been formulated under the road development projects in the Northern and Eastern Provinces and the Government of India has expressed its consent to provide loans for this project. Encouraging news indeed.
A National Policy on Highways as envisaged by the President will essentially mean that no future Government will be able to cancel or change existing road development projects without a valid reason and a solid explanation to the public. In fact, the President urged the relevant authorities to update the public on the ongoing road construction projects in a timely and transparent manner. This will earn them more confidence from the public.
One cannot blame lawmakers, the public and even the officials for their obsession with flyovers and expressways, but they must spare a thought for rural folk, like the President did at the progress review meeting. Watch any TV news bulletin at night and you are likely to see a segment highlighting a village that has no real access road or connecting bridge at all. This should not be the case in the 21st century. The President has stressed the importance of improving the rural road network  there is no use of building better roads for the city if the villager cannot access that road to bring his produce to the city or transport a patient to the city hospital. In some areas, there is a lack of clarity over exactly who is responsible for maintaining rural roads  whether it is the Provincial Council, Pradeshiya Sabha or the Central Government. Such bureaucratic issues must be resolved for the benefit of the public.
Ultimately, there is a limit to the number of roads that can be built. There are two approaches to fix this problem - traffic management and better public transport. The success of the bus lane experiment shows that traffic management measures can work if discipline is enforced. Public transport is even more important, because a comfortable, efficient and clean mass transit network such as the proposed Light Rail Transit can potentially entice motorists to leave their cars at home at least for the office run and make our roads less of a nightmare.

Six week journey  from world no. 957 to US Open champion
Sloane Stephens was planning to spend Saturday night in New York celebrating with Madison Keys, hours after beating her friend to a first Grand Slam title.
The 24-year-old American, ranked 83rd until Monday, thrashed 15th seed Keys 6-3 6-0 in just 61 minutes to complete a scarcely believable return from injury.
Asked if she would be buying the drinks, Stephens confirmed: "Yes, a lot of them apparently. We are having a little celebration and she is coming."
Just 69 days after returning from an 11-month injury lay-off, and six weeks since her ranking dropped to 957, Stephens became only the fifth unseeded woman to win a Grand Slam singles title in the Open era.
And she later revealed it was boredom as much as nerves that threatened to upset her equilibrium during the 48 hours between semi-final and final at Flushing Meadows.
"I was literally in my room twiddling my thumbs,' she said. "I was looking at car reviews last night on Auto Trader, like literally. That's how bored I was. I didn't have anything to do."
Stephens admitted that the nerves finally took hold as she stepped out onto Arthur Ashe Stadium - but a little over an hour later her eyes were bulging as a cheque for $3.7m (2.8m) was handed to her and she was announced as a Grand Slam champion.
She said: "There are no words to describe how I got here, because if you told someone this story they'd be, like, 'that's insane'."
'THERE IS NO POSITIVE TO NOT BEING ABLE TO WALK'
It is four years since Stephens first grabbed worldwide headlines when she beat compatriot Serena Williams in the Australian Open quarter-finals.
The likes of NBA stars Shaquille O'Neal and Dirk Nowitzki, and singer John Legend, congratulated her on social media, and a star had seemingly been born.
In the event, progress was harder going until 2016 when she won three titles, cementing her place in the top 30 and apparently on the up.
A right foot stress fracture halted that momentum, forcing her to withdraw from the US Open last August, and she would not return until Wimbledon.
Surgery followed in January and for the next 16 weeks Stephens was on crutches and unable to put any pressure on her foot.
Just a month before Wimbledon, she was still wearing a protective boot.
"There is no positive to not being able to walk and being on one leg," said Stephens. "That's not fun for anyone."
Finally, Stephens stepped back on court in July - and first-round defeats at Wimbledon and in Washington were entirely predictable. Her ranking plummeted to 957.
What followed was, in her own words on Saturday night, "insane".
The victory over Keys was her 15th in 17 matches, the kind of form shown by someone vying to be number one rather than avoid slipping outside the top 1,000.
"When I had surgery, I was not thinking that I would be anywhere near a US Open title," she said.
"Nor did I think I was going to be anywhere near the top 100."
'SLOANE'S BEEN AMAZING WITH ADVERSITY'
Sybil Smith made her tournament debut in the player box for the final as her daughter made history.
"It was nice that we got it right for the two weeks, and I came out with the title," said Stephens.
It is eight years since Stephens attended her father's funeral on the eve of the US Open, after he died in a car accident in Louisiana.
Estranged from the family, John Stephens had been a running back in the NFL for the New England Patriots, the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs. But it was her mother, Sybil, an all-American swimmer, who brought up Stephens, and that included introducing the nine-year-old to tennis.
"Obviously my whole life my mum has been very supportive," said Stephens. "She's been in my corner the whole time.

Solving national issues through reconciliation
Though the Arabian Prince, highlighted Lankas lack of progress, and called on the Yahapalana government to realize that its obligations are not childs plays to fool the world council but as an essential undertaking to address the rights of Lankan people of all nationalities; the European Union praised the Yahapalanaya Government for the progress made in advancing human rights, labour and environmental standards, but stressed that there were still many areas where reform had yet to be delivered. Of course we should be clear that setting up various reconciliation offices and talking of progress is not the same as implementing the 2015 resolution.
Clearly long-suffering Lankans, especially the minority nationalities need to see the resolution fully carried out, and they need to be convinced that justice is being achieved.
International conventions
All those foreign critiques must understand the struggle that is going against fascistic enemy who resort to sabotage and violence. Because of that Lanka failed to implement the UN resolution in time. After the struggle is won with mass actions, Lankas President formally created an Office of Missing Persons, as set out in the resolution and enacted by parliament. It is a victory for the anti fascistic democratic movement that the gazette notification took place on September 12, just as the Human Rights Council session got underway and a few weeks before Sri Lanka is to present an oral update on steps it has taken to carry out the resolution.
War between the Lankan state and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam was a tragedy where both sides committed many grave human rights abuses, including summary killings, abductions and enforced disappearances, torture, and sexual violence. There are well-documented allegations of laws-of-war violations, particularly during the final months of the war. The governments lack of progress in investigating and prosecuting these many crimes spurred the Human Rights Council to adopt the consensus resolution. A team of senior officials from Brussels have been in the country for 10 days recently, on a fact-finding mission. The mission has focused on the status of the implementation of 27 international conventions of which Sri Lanka is a signatory.
Progressive implementation of the conventions is the condition for continued preferential access to the European Union market - the world's largest and Sri Lanka's biggest export market  under the GSP Plus. The team had a range of meetings with Government Ministers, civil society, trade unions and other organisations. They also travelled to Jaffna and Kilinochchi to meet the Chief Minister of the Northern Province and hear the views from civil society, including a number of human rights activists. They were able to see the development in the Tamil homeland and freely discuss with representatives of various sections of the Tamil society.
Following a constructive meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Ambassador Tung-Lai Margue said: The excellent cooperation by the Government is a reminder of how much the situation has changed in the country over the last two and a half years, including real advances in human rights. But there are still important concerns about the lack of concrete progress in key areas. Torture has to stop. It is of paramount importance that the Government delivers on its commitments, including replacing the Prevention of Terrorism Act with counter-terrorism legislation consistent with international standards and allowing people in custody to have access to a lawyer from the point of arrest.
Pro Mahinda union
Clarifying the fate of those who disappeared at the end of the war and speeding up the return of land will help to restore confidence, particularly in the North and East, in the policy of national reconciliation. Concerns were also raised about continued discrimination against women and girls and against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Sri Lankans. This is very important; as fascistic elements are strongly against the liberty of such oriented people.
All these discussions and presser politics show that the liberal bourgeoisie cannot be pressurized by arguments alone. In the history it has not been so. On the other hand there may not be a threat to them of a possible takeover by the proletariat, either. No need to keep hopes so high, it could still end in a flop, but there is a need to keep relentless pressure and criticism on the government in the language they could stomach.
On the other hand criticisms of the opposition may be the best way to expose the mistakes of liberalism. It is by solidly exposing the fascistic menace that one could show the gentlemen of liberty and justice how to keep friendship with the proletarian masses. On that basis one must keep vigilance of the Yahapalana government. Vigilance must be real and should come from the side of the organised proletariat. Conscious workers must show clearly that fight against racism and fascistic actions are already in the streets; in actions voiced by many ways. Proletarian leaders must be seen in the streets with banners and placards.
There were not only debates but number of actions including Sixty two sathyagrha; these were powerful enough to galvanize, at least certain extent the government into taking a purposeful approach to dealing with the gross malfeasance of the previous regime and curbing corruption in its own ranks. Leading workers have seen the impression made in liberal intellectuals by the sensible but unrepentant anti fascistic actions by proletarian and plebian masses against the thuggery of pro Mahinda union and student actions.
It is better not to have hopes that during the tenure of this government there will be successful prosecution of the corrupt big fish of the Rajapaksa era; because that is not what we hope from liberal capitalists. Capitalists always search and look towards accumulation of capital legally or otherwise; nor we should be hopeful that corruption in UNP-SLFP ranks will be curtailed.
What we should be eagerly interested is exposing fascistic murders, cruel war crimes and the establishment of democratic constitution with power sharing. We must keep pressing for a solution based on equality, autonomy and the right of self determination. We must press for inclusion of bill of rights within the new constitution approved by a national referendum.
Ravi resigned to clear the path for investigators to work without any disturbances; but he is doing important political work behind the seen. On the contrary firing Wijeyadasa is a victory to the anti racists and a moral disaster for the fascistic Mahinda gang. As 2020 approaches most certainly pressure will mount against fascistic forces and more mass actions are likely. Also there will be desperado attacks from the side of Mahinda and Gotabhaya.

The attack with guns and bombs to the house of Nandimal Silva cannot be taken lightly. Men who committed crimes against humanity are frighten of their own shadows. Though this is true, some people expect much progress on corruption related matters and live in a dream of a country without corruption. As the battle grows they will lower their expectations. Because fight against murder and barbaric actions will gain the ground. However, all these will be connected to the battle for a new Constitution.
What we do in this country is important, but as or more important the struggle of the proletariat in the outside world. Because the theory of permanent revolution is applicable globally, as the revolution has become a subject in international arena today, more than any time before. The rise of Donald Trump is globally answered by the giants of the left such as Bernie Saunders and Jeremy Corbin. There are many in the horizon, the power of proletariat should be estimated locally as well as internationally. In that sense the pressure on Yahapalanaya has to be improved both locally and internationally. Already Turkey and South Africa have made contributions on national problem, very interesting!

St. Benedicts College prove their mettle
All Island Schools Athletic Relay Carnival:
Benedictine athletes covered themselves in glory in the Northern capital city of Jaffna, winning the All Island Schools Athletics Relay Carnival, the glamour event of the schools athletic calendar for the second consecutive time, at the championship held from 8-10 September.
Though unfortunately disqualified in two events, in which they were particularly strong, the boys from St. Benedicts achieved victory by a comfortable margin, followed by Maris Stella College, Negombo in second place.
The Benedictine juniors (under 12 and under 14 teams) faired moderately collecting some useful points. Under 16 with Anuja Prabashwara, Sasidu Bandara, Uditha Dilshan, Oshada Mattou, Pasidu Senanayake, Tejana Wahalthanthri, Sandeepa Vishanperuma and Uvindu Malshan won gold in the 4x 100 meters event and were disqualified after finishing second in the 4x200 meters event due to a marking issue.
The seniors were in terrific form completely dominating the under 18 and under 20 segments. In the under 18s sprinter Sahan Rajapaksha returned after a serious injury and P.N.T Auchithya after a bout of dengue.
Others in the squad were World Junior Games returnees Santhus Weerasinghe and Thiran Ravishka, Dilan Bogoda, Yohan Silva, Manusha Priyashan, Tharidu Nimesh and Visal Samainda. They won gold in the 4x100 meters, 4x200 meters, medley relay and silver in the 4x400 meters, under severe muddy underfoot conditions.
The strong under 20 outfit consisted of Supun Nimasha, Shammi Lakshan, both of whom selected for international meets, captain of the team Shiran Angelo Jeganathan, Randu Perera, Yohan Dias, Bawantha Rangana, Pruthivi Kavishan and Nimantha Perera.
They won gold in the 4x200 meters, medley relay, and silver in the 4x100 meter events.
In the last event of the day much looked forward to 4x400 meter relay they were disqualified due to a possible wrong decision.
The reason given was that Benedictine anchor Supun Nimasha allegedly ran into the runner from Bandaranayake College Gampaha.
However, as already reported in the media earlier in the week, video evidence clearly showed that the Benedictine anchor was in the front at the first bend and the runner from Bandaranayake College came from inside and bumped into Supun Nimasha out of the lane and it took some time for him to get back in.
The Education Ministry officials have collected the video evidence after the awards presentation and have assured the Benedictines that justice will be done after examining the video evidence.
The result of the final race did not prevent the Bens from becoming overall champions, since they had an unbeatable lead at the commencement of the event.
However, if the points difference was close, as it often happens in big competitions a mistake like this could have been decisive and should be prevented by all means. In a sport like athletics, where enthusiastic youngsters from every nook and corner of Sri Lanka and from all possible backgrounds, come together in a spirit of camaraderie and sportsmanship, meets like the All Island Schools Athletic Relay carnival should be assure that justice and fairplay prevails at all times.

Tripartite talks on Syrian cease-fire
Russia, Turkey and Iran held a fresh round of talks were in Astana, Capital of Kazakhstan on September 14 -15 to agree on four de-escalation zones prior to the forthcoming ceasefire talks with the Syrian Government and some Opposition groups.
These three states collaborated with the Syrian military in the war against the Islamic State rebels. It was the main factor that led to the weakening of the IS rebels. Syrian military victories and the in-fighting among various rebel groups had thwarted US and other Western attempts to oust the Assad regime and install the Opposition in power.
Now neither the US nor its allies call for the non-participation of the Syrian Government in the peace talks as they used to do earlier. They have quietly reconciled to the position that its presence in the talks is inevitable.
Syrian Army
Iranian Revolutionary Guards played a key role in the ground fighting while the turning point in the war came with the aerial support given to ground forces of the regime by the Russian Air Force.
With the capture of Aleppo, the foremost rebel stronghold, the Syrian military took the upper hand in the war. Now the number of defectors is increasing among the rebel forces. Most of them are fleeing to neighbouring countries. Last Thursday 1,000 militants crossed over to the Syrian Army together with seven field commanders. Their transfer was arranged by the Reconciliation Center established by the Russian Defence Ministry.
With the fall of Mosul in Iraq last February, Syrian rebels became further weakened. On September 5 the Syrian Army liberated Deir ez  Zor, held by the rebels since 2014. Raqqa, the last rebel stronghold is expected to fall by October.
Russia - a key political actor
With these developments Russia has already become a key political actor in regional developments. A Russia Iran-Turkey Axis is being strengthened as a counterweight to the US influence in the area.
Already their cooperation covers several fields including economic, political and military. For example, Turkeys trade with Russia increased by 28 percent during the first half of 2017.
According to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan the volume of Turkeys trade with Russia is expected to reach $ 100 billion by year end.
Recently oil companies in Russia, Iran and Turkey signed an agreement to jointly invest in oil and gas ventures. Turkey has also signed a deal with Russia to purchase S-400 Surface - To Air (ZAM) missile defence systems amidst opposition from NATO.
