The ball is in Sri Lankas court we cant lose the series - Hathurusingha
Former Sri Lanka cricketer turned head coach of Bangladesh Chandika Hathurusingha said the ball was in Sri Lankas court to either draw or lose the three-match One-day International series.
Bangladesh who won the first ODI at Dambulla by 90 runs are 1-0 up going into the third and final game at the SSC on Saturday.
Sri Lanka are a very strong team at home. I cant remember a time when they didnt win a single game in a series, so it is a good position that we are in, said Hathurusingha yesterday.
We are 1-0 up, we cant lose the series. They have to play well, and we have to play our best game to come good. We are very much confident, if we get our process right. I think we will do well against Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka bounced back from their defeat in the first match at Dambulla to post an imposing score of 311 in the second game played at the same venue, but before they could get at the Bangladeshi batsmen rain washed out play forcing a no-result that sees them trailing 0-1 in the series.
It was a good score, but chasing 300-plus was not easy. The wicket was better than the previous match. We were really confident that we could have got it, said Hathurusingha.
We didnt bowl as well as we could have, in certain periods. They played well on that pitch. (Kusal) Mendis and (Upul) Tharanga batted well, and did better than the last game. We came back well. The match could have gone either way, he said.
Bangladesh who have been at the receiving end on past tours to Sri Lanka are now quietly confident of returning home with a win. They have already recorded their maiden Test win against Sri Lanka and are now eyeing a maiden ODI series win.
When you win, everything looks good. The body language and effort on the field is the biggest change I have seen in the last few matches, after the Galle Test, said Hathurusingha.
They had a good one-to-one afterwards, and the boys responded to that very well. In the last game we were a bit lethargic after the first ten overs, but after that they were really good in the heat.
Hathurusingha said that batsmen converting scores into big ones was one of the things they have always spoken about. In that aspect opening bat Tamim Iqbal anchored the Bangladesh innings in the first ODI with a century that saw them run up their highest total against Sri Lanka  324-5.
If you get in, make a big contribution. The seniors have responded to that really well. It comes with the belief and maturity of the players, said Hathurusingha.
I would say it was one of the best performances for the batting group. We always talk about using the top seven batsmen in 50 and 20 overs. It is our game plan. In that sense, it was a perfect game. They are really confident in their preparation now.
It is not me, but the whole team and my coaching staff who are contributing. We are doing our best to prepare our players to perform. I am very happy with the way things are going so far.
Being a past Sri Lanka cricketer and now plotting the downfall of his own country Hathurusingha said it was a totally different feeling.
As a player you played for your country, which is a different feeling. And now, I am doing a job. I have to do it to the best possible way I can. This is not only my effort; it is a whole team effort. It is a good feeling to be on the winning side always, said 48-year-old Hathurusingha who represented his country in 25 Tests and 35 ODIs between 1991-1999.

BFE refutes allegations by Badulla resident
The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment yesterday refuted allegations made by a resident from Badulla that he visited the Bureau 37 times to complain about difficulties faced by his wife employed in Saudi Arabia and request to get her down, but the Bureau had failed to fulfil his request.
The Bureau in a press release said the person concerned who held a fast opposite the Bureau on March 27 and visited the Bureau only nine times to represent his wife's case and four such visits wee made only to hand over letters.
The Bureau said during investigations into the matter the man's wife had said she had not suffered any assault from her employer in Saudi Arabia who had promised to pay her back wages on her return to Sri Lanka.
The man concerned had stated in his letter dated November 17, 2016 that he did not mind his wife continuing to serve until February 8, 2017, the expiry date of her contract provided she is paid her salary arrears.
The licence of the foreign employment agency had been temporarily suspended on March 24, 2017 for its failure to get the woman back to Sri Lanka on the completion of her contract.
On March 28, the Sri Lanka Embassy in Saudi Arabia had informed that it would take the woman concerned under its charge to be sent back to Sri Lanka.
At a time when the Bureau is working with the Sri Lankan Embassy in Saudi Arabia to bring down the woman expatriate employee to Sri Lanka, her husband had staged a fast opposite the Bureau with the intention of causing embarrassment.

Bull shark found on road after cyclone hits Australia

A shark found in the middle of the road stunned residents of a small Australian town following a deadly storm.
The bull shark washed up on a flooded road near the town of Ayr, Queensland, aftertropical cyclone Debbie battered northeast Australia.
Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) shared photos of the shark on social media, warning members of the public to stay out of flood water near the Burdekin River.
Think it's safe to go back in the water Think again! QFES posted.
You never know what lurks beneath the surface during a severe storm and what will wash up in the aftermath.
Just ask emergency services who came across this bull during inspections around Ayr, where floodwaters are receding in some parts.
Some residents in the town took teeth from the shark as a souvenir.
WIN News journalist Philip Calder, who was covering the flooding, tweeted: The only victim of Burdekin flooding...a bull shark.
There was only moderate flooding, peaked at nine metres in Burdekin River about an hour before we took the photo, he told the Brisbane Times.
The poor guy had obviously been trying to escape the torrent orsomething like that and had beached himself onthe road.
He was looking pretty clean and wasnt decomposing, so [it] wasn't there long.
There were a couple of locals who came over with a knife and souvenired a tooth from it.
He added: Wewere pretty amazed, we were turning up to shoot a flooding road, we werent expecting to see wildlife as well.
Torrential rain hampered relief efforts after the powerful cyclone wreaked havoc, with floods sparking emergency rescues as fed-up tourists were evacuatedfrom resort islands off Queensland.

Cabinet appoints comittee to fast track economy

A Central Programme Management Unit (CPMU) to deliver big, fast economic results for the country in the next three years was approved by Cabinet this week as concerns over the economy not growing fast enough looms over the government.
On September 5, Cabinet approved the proposal to launch a programme to enable Accelerated Economic Transformation in Sri Lanka and the setting up of a Central Programme Management Unit. Thereafter, the Minister of National Policies and Economic Management and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe engaged the services of the US Consultancy group McKinsey and Company to prepare a plan for the implementation of such a programme. The agreement between the two parties was signed in November 2016.
Over the first six weeks of this year, Mckinsey consultants met with government agencies and private sector stakeholders to review government and sector plans and conducted analyses to help define a three year Economic Delivery Programme (EDP) for Sri Lanka.
According to documents on the plan, the EDP will only focus on delivering economic outcomes and not the governments social agenda.
The EDP will mainly focus on increasing, median income, private sector jobs, investment (both foreign and domestic) exports and government revenue.
Economic accelerators ,unlike the economic priorities of the government which are common to all ministries, will be given more resources and will directly come under the Prime Ministers purview, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) and the CPMU.
The McKinsey consultants have identified the three main areas of; tourism, agriculture and manufacturing to be accelerated. In Tourism, they would focus on marketing and international connectivity efforts on six tier 1 countries like India, China, UK, Germany Russia and France and capturing the luxury segment in Tier 2 markets and hubs such as Middle East- Dubai, USA-New York, Singapore, Australia and Japan. Manufacturing will focus on textiles and apparel, electronics manufacture and food and beverage manufacturing while agriculture will have focus directed at improving end to end tea processing, coconut processing and rice. Key enablers of these three sectors have identified to be; investment accelerators, digital economy and government revenue.
McKinsey has also proposed that the accelerators be led by relevant ministers closely supported by an identified private sector Czar.
They also state that they have developed similar programmes in over 20 other countries and this will be tailored to the unique context of Sri Lanka. The company has charged the government a total of USD 2,997,666 million for their efforts.
De-bureaucratising the economy and fast tracking investments have been a main concern for the government which has seen a drop of FDIs and domestic investments in the last two years. In March of this year, the CCEM received new powers to engage directly with line ministries and the Board of Investment to fast track investment projects. Given the current trend in economic growth however, the Central Bank is hopeful of a 5-5.5 percent GDP growth by the end of 2017.

A candid proposal to New Constitution Makers:  Grant Constitutional Protection to Fetal Rights
There are things, which must be understood not with intellect, but with intelligence. We should never misunderstand the phenomenon of intellect with the faculty of intelligence. They are polar opposites. Intellect is of the head. It is taught by others. It is imposed on you. One has to cultivate intellect. It is burrowed. It is something foreign. It is not inborn. But intelligence is inborn. It is ones own being, the very nature.
It is intelligence that has the propensity to wisdom, with the help of which, as the Buddha taught, one understands things for what they truly are. Hence, in order to comprehend the fetal rights and the dire need of its constitutional protection, one must approach the subject not with intellection, but with intelligence. Various legal doctrines, jurisprudential arguments and logical debates stem from intellect and hence, for the most part, fraught with the possibility of flaw.
A word after spoken would not revert back. The time, after gone cannot be reversed. The reproduction of an occasion, after it is missed, is an absolute impossibility.
Therefore, the new constitution of Sri Lanka to be, yet, is an unspoken word, an occasion, not yet missed and hence, must be made use of to constitutionally protect the right to life and fetal rights.
Right to life
The Good Governance is in the making of the new Constitution of Sri Lanka. For any Governance to be good, only problem addressing would not suffice. It needs to strengthen and fortify fundamental rights of the people, it represents.
The constitutional making is a wonderful chance, the Good Governance may make use of. Thus, among the rights, which are anticipated to be constitutionalized, the right to life represents the one, not only pivotal, but also central. Why
Undoubtedly, the phenomenon of life is the most important truth in the Universe. Among various kinds of lives, the human's life is very important. Humans life is the noblest among all and the excellent entity of existence.
Mankind is the most talented creature and that is why his life is so centrally significant. Actually, what distinguishes the value of the human's life from that of other creatures, while making him outstanding among other creatures, are his astonishing and extraordinary physical and spiritual potentials and talents.
Cognition of the magnitude of human, who enjoys wisdom, judgement, insight, discretion, knowledge, will power, conscience, love, perfectionism and management, is not easy. And these are only a fraction of it, as all these are only a part of the power and ability of man's life. Compared to other creatures, scope and span of human's life impact, is so vast and astonishing that in various dimensions, without any pause in history, it has always attracted the attention of scholars and philosophers.
The most important principle of inherent rights is the right to life for mankind. This has been unanimously accepted by all schools of thought. The right to life is one of the inherent and natural rights of mankind. It is the fundamental of all other rights of mankind. There are no other rights for mankind without the right to life.
Inherent right means no legislated law is required for the existence of the right to life, and this state itself is a law for everyone, including animals. No law, be it internal or international, grants life to man. It only can protect mans right to life. Legislated laws in every system and every society must protect and defend the human's right to life, in order to provide necessary safety for man. And it must find its vivid reflection in the fundamental law of the country- the constitution.
Rights of the fetus
If the conceptualized doctrinally unsubstantiated polemics are to be set aside for a moment and should one is to empirically refer to the authentic inception of life, it can be well seen and discerned that life begins with the conception of the fetus in the mothers womb. The fetus and its conception is a mysterious dimension, well above and beyond law. It may seem metaphysical to some legal luminaries, yet, the truth is not a lie. The final destination of life is not its end, but, its continuity and perfection via evolution. That is the essence of man-woman duality. Womans womb is the God-gifted space for the conception of the fetus and the fetus, in its turn, is the foundational power for the continuation of mankind. Hence, the mother has been assigned an existential duty to continue the mankind, which, she bears the total responsibility for. This existential responsibility cannot and should not be one, to be absolved from. It is an existential necessity, though, there may certainly be rare exceptions. Hence, the constitution making of Sri Lanka must be in concordance with natural patterns of human development and no constitution can last, if it is diametrically opposed to nature. Why Nature is above law. All the written laws are man-made and man-made laws are incapable of granting absolute justice. The best, they, in the administration of justice, can reach is, not total justice, but, its proximity.
Jurisprudential polemics
In many court cases, determining the right to abortion and birth control, the central question, posed, in order to counter the defending of the right of the fetus to life is, Is fetus a person Can a fetal personhood be established Can the unborn children be persons within the linguistics and meaning of international conventions, the main intent of which is, the protection of human rights These are the questions, the abortion and birth-control promoting NGOs are making use of. Now, the Sri Lankan constitutional makers have a responsible duty. That is not be trapped in to such NGO homilies, which degrade the innocent wombs of our mothers in to brutal killing fields and constitutionally guarantee the right of the fetus to life unequivocally, certainly with the simple exception of the medically recommended abortion and birth-control by medical professionals, in order to protect the life of the mother.
Duty of Good Governance
It is good to refer to some judicial precedents, in order to consider and acquire the right experience of other indigenous and international jurists for the determination of certain cases. Yet, it is not necessary to absolutize this practice, embracing all what is coming from the West. Sri Lanka has a historical heritage. It never teaches us to kill our children.
The beautiful religion of the majority original community of this country is Buddhism. Therein, the brutalization of mothers wombs in to killing fields has been clearly declared as sin.
Besides, thanks to the NGO introduced Golden Family Concept and the animalistic deception of abortion and birth-control based economic prosperity, more than 800,000 women, for the most part, Sinhala Buddhist mothers, have been subjected to birth control and as a dangerous consequence of it, the nation is heading towards its own cessation, with the threat of non-discernible and gradual disappearance. Colombo capital is the best example of it. Hence, there is a burning need to constitutionally guarantee the right to life and right of the fetus to life, the fundamental responsibility for which goes to the managers of Good Governance.
Text explicity
The plagiarizarion, clandestinely extracting jurisprudential texts, formulated by others, certainly would not help. Vague terminologies, absence of doctrinal exactitude, impertinence to actual domestic needs, disregard of national interest, harmful destruction of the demographic development of the country, space allocation for the NGOs of vested interest, to interpret the law to suit their private agendas are matters, the constitution makers should pay their attention for.
Implicit recognitions by certain legal luminaries on concrete cases should not be absolutized and they can be used on a particularized and concretized basis. Yet the constitution, dealing with the right to life, should comprise, not a ground, wherein implicit conjectures are possible, but a solid foundation, which writes explicit jurisprudential terms, which, elements like NGOs of vested interest, will not be able to paralyze and brutalize against the nation, in the present case, against the conceived fetal rights and its total possibility of uninterrupted growing in to a full-fledged human person. Importing imperfect jurisprudential texts from international conventions and their constitutional embodiment in the fundamental law of Sri Lanka, would only do more harm than profit.
The absence of unanimity of all States, in holding unborn children to be persons under criminal, tort, and property law, the erroneous findings of certain jurists in substantive law, which, as a whole, amount to judicial errors and which should be held null and void as to the rights and interests of unborn persons, must not serve as the jurisprudential foundation to destroy the rights of the fetus, conceived in the wombs of Sri Lankan mothers.

Citizens Organizations Collective demand justice
Citizens Organizations Collective have urged the government not to grant any amnesty to the security force members who have engaged in suppression or attacks against civil society representatives and media personal at the behest of the Rajapaksa regime under the guise of fighting terrorism.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, Citizens Organisations Collective representative Akalanka Hettiarachchi said when the government is acting against such elements of the security forces, Rajapaksa loyalists are alleging that the government is hunting down war heroes.
Several security forces members have been implicated in several criminal cases including the murder of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickramathunge and the abduction of Journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda. Their families are still fighting for justice.
"We appreciate President Maithripala Sirisenas statement that he will stand for war heroes who helped crush terrorism, but, he will not defend any security force member found guilty of murdering and attacking civil society members and journalists. However, we have asked the government to reveal the names of those who ave the orders for these acts to be carried out by the security forces members," he said.
"Since MP Wimal Weerawansas arrest, many people who had abused powers during the former regime are living in fear. MP Weerawansa does not say that he is innocent of these charges. But, says that others were
also guilty of the same offences. However, he had a chance to become a state witness and reveal the misdeeds of the Rajapaksa regime. If he agreed to such a condition, then we can push for some sort of leniency. But, enaging in a death-fast will not help him win the court cases against him," Hettiarachchi said.
He added that it has been revealed that the EPF has lost Rs.9,500 million as a result of the bond scam . "The cuprites of the case are now staring various business venture and investing money for various projects. We request the government to probe these cases soon and confiscate their wealth looted from the public," he added.
Left Circle Co-convener Chameera Perera said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had said that the government had demeaned the dignity of MP Weerawansa. "But, he has forgotten how he and Weerawansa
demeaned the dignity and tarnished the character of former Cheif Justice Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake. Weerawansa said former Chief Justice Bandaranaike should be sent home in 24 hours. he who has not even passed his O/L insulted Dr.Bandaranayake who appeared before the Committee in Parliament. That is how Weerawansa insulted the judiciary. If the MP had misappropriated public money and property which had benefited his family and associates, now he has to face the consequences. Many culprits responsible for various crimes and racist attacks during the former regime have not been arrested yet. There is no investigation still against 'Bodu Bala Sena' responsible for the Aluthgama incident," he pointed out.

Colombo most suited to be South Asias commercial hub: Port City official

Sri Lankan capital Colombo is the most suitable to be South Asias commercial hub, says Liang Thow Ming, Chief Marketing Officer of the US$ 1.4 billion Colombo Port City project being executed by the China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC), The New Indian Express said.
Liang told this correspondent that Colombo is not only South Asias cleanest and the most livable city, it is also the capital of a country which has no quarrels with any of the nations in South Asia.
That makes Colombo an ideal place to create and run a regional commercial hub, he added.
People from all parts of South Asia can come to Sri Lanka and do business here without issues relating to their nationality, Liang pointed out, in a veiled reference to problems between India and Pakistan which hinder free movement of goods, services and people between the two countries.
In fact, from the general acceptability point of view, Colombo could be the Singapore of South Asia, Liang added.
A Singapore national of Chinese origin, Liang said that the Colombo Port city (now renamed Colombo Financial City) will be an international commercial and financial hub with its own legal system based on the British model and labor laws attuned to the needs of modern businesses. It will have investments from all parts of the world and not necessarily from China.
Serving the Indian Market
However, the Financial City will be primarily serving the Indian market which is the single largest in the total South Asian market of 1.7 billion people, Liang said.
Indians who want to park funds abroad could do it in the Colombo Financial City, rather than in Dubai or Mauritius, as Colombo is the nearest and also culturally compatible, he noted.
Asked about Indias opposition to the project on security grounds, especially after the visit of Chinese submarines in 2014, Liang said that India has since dropped its opposition because Indian businessmen and government officials have realized that the Port City is nothing but a commercial venture in which Indians are welcome to invest.
He said he has met Indian entrepreneurs and even addressed the association of top Indian real estate developers at their conference held in Shanghai. The delegates expressed an interest in knowing more about the project. Liang also met the former Indian Deputy External Affairs Minister Shashi Tharoor, an ardent advocate of India-China cooperation.
According to Liang, it would cost a company about US$ 200 million to invest in land, buildings and business in the Colombo Port City. There are about 1000 top Indian developers out of which 100 to 200 may be able to raise US$ 200 million, he estimated.
However, the question is whether it will be worthwhile for them to shift to Colombo from India or Dubai to Colombo, Liang said. According to the Chinese Ambassador in Sri Lanka, Yi Xianliang, four or five top Indian companies have expressed an interest in investing in the port city, but he would not name them.
Following the Sri Lankan Presidential election in January 2015, in which the incumbent President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who initiated the Port City project, was defeated, the new government stalled work on it for a few months to investigate some charges and also to negotiate the terms.
But after the modification of the terms, work is going full steam ahead,Liang said.
The Port City has just re-started reclamation work, but marketing of the project is also being done in right earnest simultaneously, he added. There has been no advertising but potential investors are being contacted and engaged.
The Project
The Colombo Port City project envisages the reclamation of 269 hectares from the sea south of the Colombo harbor opposite Galle Face. Reclamation is expected to be completed in two or two a half years. In 2018, the eastern side will have been reclaimed. The reclaimed portion, divided into blocks, will have all modern infrastructural facilities so that the buyer or investor can just plug in start his operations, Liang said.
The mini city will have offices, 21,000 residential apartments, four sites for hotels, parks, a marina, and entertainment facilities. There will be no fancy attractions of the kind Dubai boasts of, but it will be a world class Smart City, Liang said.
Step by Step Watching the Bottom Line
The port city will not be built not all at once, but in phases stretching over 30 years, Liang said.
Eventually, there will be 71 plots with two or three being readied for sale every year. The plots will be sold to investors from Sri Lanka and overseas in stages as per a business plan. The Port City authority will be watching the ventures bottom line constantly, as it is essentially a business enterprise.
The Port City will be 20 per cent less in size than the Marina Bay in Singapore, and is expected to have a fixed population of 80,000 and a floating one of 220,000.
Its financial laws will be based on the British model. It will have its own courts but with Sri Lankan judges. Labor laws too will be international in nature. According to Liang, stringent international labor laws will not be an issue as the Port City will be providing opportunities to Sri Lankans to work in an international environment at higher wages, and that, at their very door step. As it is, enterprising Sri Lankans are seizing similar opportunities provided by countries in the Middle East and West.
Quashing propaganda that Chinese funded projects use mostly Chinese labor, Liang said that the Port City project currently employs 70 people out of whom, 50 are Sri Lankans or of Sri Lankan origin; 10 are Chinese nationals and another ten are from 15 different countries.
Relations with Sri Lankan Government
Since the Port City is a collaborative venture of the CHEC and the Sri Lankan government, the 269 hectares of reclaimed land will be divided between them. The government will get 153 ha and the CHEC 116 ha on a 99 year lease. Both are expected to make money from the lands allotted to them.
The Port City will be dependent on the Sri Lankan authorities for power and water. In this context, Liang welcomed the development of the Western Province though the multi-billion dollar Megapolis project as it will vastly improve the Port Citys hinterland.
Challenges
However, the Port City project faces challenges and some uncertainties as it aims to develop an autonomous business system within Sri Lanka, Liang said.
There is anxiety about the stability of the Sri Lankan governments policies, which is understandable given the stoppage of the project after the government changed. The second anxiety is over implementation of policies which must be consistent. And thirdly, the new laws for the city will have to be drafted carefully and unambiguously, Liang said.

Combined efforts of all stakeholders A MUST to achieve SDGs
With countries around the world agreeing to the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030, the world is moving forward from the industrial era to the sustainable era.
In 2015, global leaders agreed to adopt the SDGs with the aim of transforming our world by 2030. The Paris agreement was ratified by 198 countries including Sri Lanka at the summit of the United Nations Framework convention on Climate change.
The government from March 31 to April 4 will launch the programme Thirasara Lanka (Sustain Lanka) at the BMICH to bring together all stakeholders in the country in order to find and showcase ways in which these goals can be adopted into the Sri Lankan context.
Chairman of the Strategic Enterprises Development Agency (SEMA) Asoka Abeygunawardena who is in charge of the programme, in an interview with the Daily News explained what it was all about.
Excerpts of the interview follow:
Q: What are the programmes SEMA is currently working on
A: Earlier, SEMA focused on the development of state owned enterprises. It was formed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumarathunga to ensure that state owned strategical enterprises are not privatized while not being a burden to the country at the same time, as most of these institutions were running at a loss. It also develops strategies to improve the performances of state owned enterprises and currently there are 20 state owned enterprises under SEMA.
But, President Maithripala Sirisena instructed us to concentrate on sector wise issues as well. Currently, we are implementing two major projects related to agriculture.
Last year, SEMA formulated a three year national programme covering 10 sectors to strengthen organic farming methods without the use of pesticides and chemicals. Last year, we conducted training programmes and mobilized farmers for it. During the 2016 Maha Season, we worked with 7,500 paddy farmers covering 10,000 acres, and now the harvesting of these fields are taking place. We have proved that there is no additional cost involved in organic farming. The harvest is the same or sometimes more, when using organic farming. We are mainly streaming it, other farmers too would be involved in this endeavour.
This is a three year programme, our aim is to label Sri Lankan food products as if its Sri Lankan its toxin free, and we can also target high end markets worldwide.
At present, the contribution from agriculture to GDP has dropped to about 10 percent from 30 to 40 percent which means that the agricultural economy is collapsing and as a result we witnessed that poor females in those villages had to go to the Middle East to earn an income. With this intervention, they could come and work in their own paddy fields.
Q: What measures have been taken to incorporate the SDGs to all these sectors
A: The target for toxin free food is very important as the United Nations has declared that we will be moving towards a sustainable era from the industrial era. In 2015, the UN announced the SDGs covering 17 areas. We mainly cover sustainable agriculture and food but that will in the long run, address many of the issues pertaining to poverty.
What we have done covers a major sustainable development goal. This is a paradigm shift. During the industrial period, we were talking about using more chemicals, widening the road, having more vehicles and having high rise buildings. But under SDGs we talk of the opposite; our focus is not only on economic growth but how satisfied the people truly are. Its not only focused on consumerism.
Climate change is also another reason why we need to focus on SDGs. Global carbon dioxide concentrations have increased by 50 percent, the global average temperature has increased by 1 degree and sea level raise has risen to 20cm. As a result, the world had to face many disasters. This shift has changed everything, our agricultural practices cannot survive.
President Sirisena at the beginning of this year clearly stated that we are marching towards a sustainable era and appointed an expert committee to come up with ideas and suggestions which sets not only 2030 targets, but also the 2020 targets. The present government is also setting its own targets to be achieved by 2020.
Q: What is the Thirasara Lanka (Sustain Lanka) programme about
A: It is a combined effort by state agencies, private firms, small scale entrepreneurs, non-governmental organizations, community based organizations, co-operative societies, scientists, creative artists, researchers, inventors, media personnel, school children, youth, farmer communities and consumers to Sustain Sri Lanka (Thirasara Lanka).
In January 2017, the government of Sri Lanka launched the Sustainable Era initiative and the year 2017 was declared as the year for eradicating poverty.
These steps were taken to move Sri Lanka into a sustainable future. The sustainable Lanka, education and trade fair organized by the Presidential Secretariat along with the Strategic Enterprise Management Agency, aiming to create awareness over various facets of a sustainable country among the general public.
The event is scheduled to be held at the BMICH from March 31 to April 4, 2017. During this five day period, we expect approximately one million participants with whom we could share knowledge, raise awareness, provide training, exchange success stories on achieving sustainability and come to a common understanding on how we can achieve sustainability together.
We believe that this event would also provide a unique opportunity for the private sector to contribute to a national level discussion on the different sustainable developmental agendas in relation to their own business interests.
All 17 SDGs will be divided into five days for which we will be having major rallies. There will be another 80 events which will run parallel to the main one, covering all the SDGs. The 17th goal (Partnerships for the Goals - Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development) clearly states that this cannot be achieved only by the state but should be done with the partnership of all institutions, private sector and the people. This event will be a gathering of all the sector leaders and discussions will be held on how to develop partnership and work collectively to achieve the targets.
Q: What are the major events that are to take place
A: This is an initiative that will determine the future of Sri Lanka. The community is still in the industrial era where they have consumerism oriented practices. Their mind set need to be changed. The UN highlighted to focus on the economic, social and environment sector but in Sri Lanka we have added another and that is the spiritual side.
Visitors will get the chance to buy toxin free food at affordable prices at the Avurudu fair. There will be green products from local industries, sales stalls, industrial stalls, health clinics, toxin free cookery demonstrations, nutrition programmes, green job fairs, green entrepreneurship chain, women and children  counselling services, educational exhibition stalls, presentation of research papers, innovations demonstrations, creative contests, discussions, debates, Janakala, cinematic creations, Art circle and art meet, farmers meet, consumer voice, relief for consumer complaints, home garden network, renewable energy and energy conservation, physical health programmes, intellectual discourses and media zones.
There are 57 regulators to safeguard the rights of the consumers but people are not aware of them. There will be a separate place, where consumers can come up with their complaints and representatives from all sectors will be present to help them out.
There should be a mechanism in between to facilitate both the consumers and the regulators and with the Presidential Secretariat we are facilitating a programme to establish a national consumer network. It will be an independent institution where non-governmental organizations, trade unions and farmers organizations will be a part and that will help the consumers to contact the regulators.
There will be 1,000 stalls and in addition, we need to have a different approach. The organizers and the visitors also should adhere to sustainable principles. This will create a new culture. People should visit this to have a clear idea about the SDGs.
Q: SDGs are always interconnected. What is the support extended by the other institutions for this
A: There will be 250 private sector stalls and more than 500 stalls from strategic enterprises. All ministries and institutions are currently studying ways in which we can incorporate SDGs to our programmes. They are participating in it in a positive manner. They are also prepared to have discussions.
For example, during the Thirasara Lanka five day programme; the first day will be about the quality of life focusing on good health and well-being, gender equality and quality of education. The second day will be about sustainable livelihoods focusing on elimination of poverty, decent work, economic growth, industry innovation and infrastructure. Third day will be about a space for the environment focusing on zero hunger, clean water, sanitation, climate action, life on land and life below water. The fourth day will be about responsible consumption and production, affordable and clean water and partnerships for the goals. The fifth day will be about reducing inequality, sustainable cities and communities, peace justice and strong institutions.
The targets cannot be achieved in isolation; the SDGs are also very well interconnected and dependent on each other.
Q: Are you doing enough to achieve all of the SDGs
A: The goals cannot be prioritized in order; all should be done at the same time. But practically, each country will have their priority areas. As we are not a fully industrialized country, we are in a better footing to move towards to a sustainable era.
The government has identified four key themes that can be utilized; they are bio diversity, renewable energy and capable human resources. The people have the potential to move towards a sustainable era considering the nature of our country.
Achieving these goals and targets require the combined efforts of various stakeholders through multiple partnerships to ensure that no one gets left behind. I think Sri Lanka is making progress.

Fines for child labour exploiters to go up
Fines for those who engage children in child labour will be increased to Rs. 25,000, Labour and Trade Unions Relations Minister John Seneviratne said.
He was addressing the media at the Global Towers, Colombo yesterday.
The minister said stringent laws should be in place to eliminate child labour. Sri Lanka is heading towards a child labour free country. The fines should be increased to achieve this end," he said.
Minister Seneviratne said children between 15 -17 ages are being used for drug smuggling in Colombo.
We are investigating the issue. Measures will be taken to prevent children being engaged in similar activities," he said.
He said Sri Lanka agreed to eliminate child labour at the Global Child Labour Conference in 2010 held at Hague, the Netherlands. Meanwhile, there has been a decrease in use of child labour over the past few years indicating Sri Lankas ability of eliminating child labour, he said.
Sri Lankas efforts to eliminate child labour have been successful according to the recently launched Child Activity Survey 2016 by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS). The report shows a low level of child labour which has been estimated as one percent of the child population," Minister Seneviratne said.

Grave injustice for rural children: SHARE AND SHARE ALIKE!
The watched pot never boils. Yet, the department of examination has released the much awaited G.C.E.(O/L) results in double quick time to the utter surprise of the parents, teachers and the students. In my ramblings, I came upon some children who were on cloud nine. Even though they were in rural areas, they were busy communicating among friends about their results over their smart phones and their general mood was that they had earned good results commensuratingly to their hard work, dedication, devotion, alacrity and enthusiasm in studies.
Unspoilt rural child in the bucolic environment fed with the pastoral nutrients always would do if the ideal facilities for education are provided with. Yet, it is reported in every media that their urban counterparts have competed well. It is not surprising because the schoolmaster is abroad. Their schools have the state-ofthe art facilities, veteran teachers who have migrated into the city looking for green pastures, internet coverage to the fullest and to cap them all, educated parents who leave no stone unturned to make their children win the mad rat race of education for the upward social mobility in their Newfoundland.
I had the good fortune to have a friendly exchange of words with some rural parents regarding their childrens education.
It is very poignant. I feel very proud of our rural parents because they are genuine to their heart core. Their ardent desire is to see their children shine. It was quite palpable to me that most of these parents keep half-starved to meet their ends. They work under the tea-bushes, in the muddy fields deep to their waists, send their elder sisters to the sweat-shops and mothers to the Middle East to wash the cutlery of the oil-riched middle east families who drive nails into their fragile bodies at the drop of a hat, just to give some younger ones a sound education.
The children burn midnight oil to come out of the vicious circle of poverty through education and it is a commendable effort from their part. It is needless to say that they are the people who earn for the country, make doctors, and pay for the perks of our honourable parliamentarians. The irony is that the fore-mentioned segment of the society is always put into oblivion when the dividends are shared.
Peoples representatives
My concern here is a matter of national significance. I hope the compassionate president, well-read premier, the youthful minister of education and the fully dedicated members of the august assembly who always give priority to the underdog would contemplate on this matter in depth.
In an arm-chair study, I came to know that the rural children have scored very poorly in English Language. In some cases Queens lingo is quite alien to them. In our neighbouring India English is their lingua-franca. But other languages are given pride of place. Our country is comparatively a very small one quite invisible to the naked eye on the map of the world. Therefore it is very irrational if someone says that it is impossible to propagate English in every nook and cranny of the country. It is not a Himalayan task. If our people-friendly peoples representatives take up the cudgels, we are here to back up. We, the teachers of the yester year are retired, but not tired.
Most of the retirees of our country are rejuvenated and ready to shoulder the responsibilities when a national need arises.
The writer begs pardon to digress your much needed attention to another crying need in the rural areas with regard to English education. It is discernible that the prevalent situation of English education in remote areas is poignantly pathetic. It could be attributed to many a distinguishable factor. No enough teachers of English are available there on one hand and on the other hand those who are posted to such remote areas manage to get transfers to convenient places in no time. It is a perennial problem quite chronic with the system.
All the governments who rode to power on the back of the farmer and the chena cultivator, from the votes of the proletariat, turned their back to this innocent segment of the population. Lo and behold, some students who had scored some good results asked me whether there was a subject called English Literature. The urban reader or the students of the city schools may find these information ridiculous.
Yet, it is the ground reality. I have come to know that some city schools visit their counterparts in the very countryside with books and other educational paraphernalia. They would have witnessed what I am writing here. It is I who made the children of one rural school in Monaragala wear white trousers. I shared their fate with me. After one school term, I stayed with them in their village and cleared the jungle and made a vast chena cultivation for the sole purpose of making them able to buy trousers and shining shoes. I derived much pleasure when they attended the school in pure white school attire with smiling faces. The rest is history.
I was able to make a revolutionary approach to teaching English with a multiple effect. I gave a thorough understanding of the rudiments in English to the entire staff within a record time of six months. I continued teaching them every evening after school. In fact, I was very crazy with teaching English after my university education. My second step was to teach each and every subject teacher, the English words they needed in their lessons. Thus, in their subject lessons they introduced their topics with the English version.
Childrens vocabulary
The childrens vocabulary developed marvelously to the utter surprise of the principal. The much needed interest in learning was created almost effortlessly and children started learning English like duck to water. It was a featherbed start for a long journey. My effort came into fruition and some of my students now have become good teachers of English.
If I go back to my beginning with regard to their asking about literature, it was quite palpable to me that without a formal study of literature, the elements of literature had been in their veins. The writer wishes to project some salient aspects of their genuine expressions for the readers to judge the situation. The pith of the matter is given with possible interpretations to make a case in point why they deserve to be given a proper coaching in literature. They requested me explain a poem about the jungles, animals, waterways, rain and clouds, weather, rural scenes, winds an fairies. They could be better students to study the romantic period of literature. They asked me to tell a story about child abuse and cruel women.
My mind went back to HAVISHAM. I described them the episode and at the end they were overjoyed on HAVISHAMs tears in apologizing PIP, the protagonist. At the same time it was discernible to me that they were very shocked to learn that HAVISHAM was caught in a fire in her bridal saree. They showered immense praise on PIP for his daring effort to rescue her from the tongues of fire. Yet, it was heart rendering to them when I explained them that PIPs hand were severely burnt. Their empathy with PIP would make them literary genius one day if they would be given the necessary facilities for learning English Literature.
The picture in rural schools is not so rosy, so the authorities have to wake up from their slumber and do the needful. They could visit either M/GALEARAWA or NELLIYADDA in Monaragala or any other rural school to have the firsthand information. If a need arises, I would be available as such a pilgrimage is sweet.
Many a question they asked me prompted me to write this in detail. Another pertinent and heart rendering question was a gross injustice to them done by educational policy planners and higher authorities from time immemorial.
As they had mastered the rudiments of Sinhala Literature, they put forward a barrage of questions and also complaints about not teaching English Literature to them. The questions were really thought provoking. They put me against the wall as the idioms goes and questioned me as from an educational authority. Their main question was why they had been educationally ill-treated, discriminated, cornered for no fault of theirs They told me that their parents had voted all the leaders to come to power from elections to elections in turn, yet their right to education had been given the Cinderella treatment.
I really thought that I had opened a Pandoras Box that should have been a debate in the parliament. They put raised a question that I was not able to answer straight forward. When the urban child learns English Literature and get an A, B, C or even an S pass they would have an edge over the rural child at an island level interview for the recruitment for the government or private sector employment. Moreover they very logically pointed out that they are blessed with opportunities for improving spoken English with their parents and peers. In addition they learn Western music, ICT, and play cricket which are given priority at recruitments for both local and foreign employment. They pleaded with me to air these views in the relevant forums on their behalf.
English language teacher
When I asked them whether they had read GULLIVER TRAVELS, OLIVER TWIST, GREAT EXPECTATIONS, ROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS,TENNYSON AND HILARY ON MOUNT EVEREST, NAPOLEAN BONAPART, MAYOR OF THE CASTERBRIDGE, LE MISERABLE ,GRASS FOR MY FEET, DAFFODILS, THE BROOK, or any other novel or a piece of poetry they felt very envy of their city counterparts when I told them that city children were keeping them in their satchels. Even the names of the above books were Greek to them.
To clinch over, who are responsible for this educational calamity They have already become the eroded shores in the intellectual flow of the Nile. As a teacher of English language here and abroad having a proven track record almost well over four decades, having braved many a weather in teaching, I dare say that this anomaly could be rectified very easily. It is not a Herculean task. One of the English language teacher methodologists of high calibre of our time, of TV English language teaching programme fame, GERNEL MAYAKADUWA is in a firm view that the prevalent bizarre situation could be rectified with no extra sweat if the English language teachers in rural schools are given a sound footing in teaching literature, too.
Another drawback of the system is that these innocent rural children are herded to compete with the city children at English competitions. The city child is jubilant because they bag all the certificates, medals, trophies and credits. The principals boast at their morning assemblies of their talents without knowing the ground realities of the grave situation that their rural counterparts paved them the golden path. These things are done under much fanfare and the rural child is the victim of the system.
Tennakoon Bandara of the Monaragala English Teaching Resource Centre who has successfully shouldered the responsibility of resurrecting the stamina of the teachers of English language and literature deserves the salute of the nations anglophiles for his ardent desire to see the light at the end of the tunnel. The country ought to be geared towards a literary Sri Lanka because it is in literature where we breathe the true fragrance of Queens Lingo.
Whats sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.

Independent Media Council in the offing
The Mass Media and Parliamentary Reforms Ministry is engaged in drafting new legislation to set up an Independent Media Council, Deputy Minister Karunarathna Paranavithana said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said the new legislation would be titled Independent Council for News Media Standards Act. Deputy Minister Paranavithana said several models of media regulation have been proposed in this regard, adding that the model which would be most suitable to the Sri Lankan context would be selected in consultation with all stakeholders.
He said several roundtable discussions with media owners, journalists and journalists associations would be held shortly to come to an agreement on the legislation, prior to making the official draft.
Asked whether the new legislation would replace the Sri Lanka Press Council Act, the Deputy Minister said it has not been decided yet.
However he said the Press Council has already been asked not to exercise its draconian powers vested under the Press Council Act.
Asked whether the new regulation would cover even the online media, Paranavithana observed regulation of online media via legislation would be practically difficult.
However, he said the Media Ministry would soon establish a separate section called Social Media Development Section to deal with social media related issues.
Under this, certain measures will be taken to get qualitative outcome from the web-based media. We will also organise training programmes for social media journalists and educate them on ethics. Our approach to web-based media will be educationally driven rather than regulation, he said.

Training scholarships in various industries offered to Sri Lanka have been enthusiastically received by Sri Lankans and fully utilised while also increasing such training opportunities given to Sri Lanka.
We have seen enthusiastic participation from Sri Lanka with almost full utilization of the allocated Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation program slots India's High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu said on Wednesday.
Singh was addressing the Indian High Commission's Joint Celebration of Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) program and International Students Day at Ballroom of Taj Samudra, Colombo on March 28.Minister Rishad Bathiudeen and Deputy High Commissioner Arindam Bagchi were present.
I thank Minister Rishad Bathiudeen for all the support he has given to sustain Indo-Sri Lanka relations. India always believed skills are the real strength. ITEC, started in 1964, has been an important component in India's development partnerships, High Commissioner Singh said. Importance of acquiring right skill-sets have gone up in today's knowledge based societies. ITEC offers technical training, consultancies overseas and feasibility studies. Almost 280 course are conducted annually and they are offered to more than 160 countries all over the globe. Certain programs are response oriented. Sri Lanka is one of the most important ITEC partner countries. We have seen enthusiastic participation from Sri Lanka with almost full utilization of the allocated ITEC slots. We increased ITEC slots allocated to Sri Lanka from 225 to 370, starting 2016. ITEC is not just about human resource development or capacity building and more than bilateral techno economic partnership-It looks at preparing ourselves to face the world together.
Minister Bathiudeen, addressing the event thanked India for its support to Sri Lanka. ITEC is only a part of support and cooperation extended to Sri Lanka by people of India over the years, and I thank the people of India for all such continued support said Minister Bathiudeen and added: Sri Lanka is on a development journey towards higher-middle income ranks, as per the vision of the unity government. In this background we place great importance to human resource and skills development.
India's ITEC programme is historic, starting way back in 1964. Under ITEC India assists young professionals from 160 countries including Sri Lanka to enter into 280 study courses in many top Indian institutions. ITEC also offers a menu of short term courses such industries as info-tech, banking, and even remote sensing.
Sri Lanka is one of the most important partner countries for the ITEC and Colombo Plan Scholarship Program. Since ITEC began in 1964, more than 1000 Sri Lankans -mostly young professionals-attended various study courses (on scholarships) and returned.

Indian Navy Chief says Indian fishermen are crossing maritime boundaries
The Indian Navy has been tracking and monitoring Chinese submarines in the Indian Ocean, the Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Sunil Lanba, said here on Wednesday.
At a press conference after a programme to mark the decommissioning of the Tu-142M long-range maritime patrol aircraft after 29 years of service and the silver jubilee of INS Rajali at the naval air station in Arakkonam on Wednesday, he said the Chinese had been deploying submarines in the Indian Ocean since 2013.
On fishermen coming into conflict with Sri Lanka, he said, Indian fishermen have been crossing maritime boundary, going and fishing in Sri Lankan waters. A dialogue is going on and there was a meeting between fishing associations of Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu.
Admiral Lanba said the Tu-142M had extensively flown in the airspace around Sri Lanka when the island nation was fighting the LTTE. He recollected the crucial role played by the squadron in Operation Cactus in the Maldives, when fleeing mercenaries were detected and tracked till they were apprehended by Indian warships.
On coastal security, he said that after the November 26 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, the Navy was made overall in-charge of maritime security. We have worked together with the Coast Guard and also coastal State governments and a whole lot of other agencies, such as the marine police and the Department of Fisheries, to ensure that our coasts are safe, he said.
Admiral Lanba pointed out that the Indian Navy were the pioneers in indigenisation. It started building ships in India in the early 1960s, and had built over 200 ships in Indian shipyards.
We have worked along with Defence Research and Development Organisation in developing many products for the Navy. We are there for indigenisation, we are there for Make in India, he said.
He said the Navy was the first to support the Aeronautical Development Agency and the DRDO in developing the light combat aircraft (LCA). We are committed to an Indian fighter aircraft that can operate from an aircraft carrier.
The LCA Mk1 does not meet our requirements to be a carrier-based fighter aircraft. It does not have the correct power-to-thrust ratio, he said.

JHU strongly objects to PC motion: Warnasinghe
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) strongly objects the motion passed by the Provincial Councils to identify its Chairmen as Speakers and their deputies as Deputy Speakers, said JHU National organizer and Western Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe.
He said all Provincial Councils had passed this resolution and sent to Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapa to include it in the Constitution which is being formulated.
Warnasinghe made this observation yesterday at a press conference at the JHU office in Battaramulla.
He stated that this motion is against the Provincial Councils Act as well. Warnasinghe added that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the JHU objected the motion when it was moved in the Western Provincial Council on March 21. He said the motion had been moved on a decision reached at a meeting of the Provincial Council Chairmen.
The same resolution formulates nine provincial Parliaments similar to Parliament and this is a step towards separatism, the Provincial Councillor said. He said the UPFA members of seven Provincial Councils support former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The supporters of Mahinda Rajapaksa are speaking of a united country but they support a motion that strengthens separatism. The JHU does not support a resolution that promotes separatism, Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said.
He said the worst suggestion has been for a new constitution by the Northern and Western Provincial Councils.
They had suggested that the powers of the Governors of Provincial Councils, representative of the President, should be pruned as much as possible, Warnasinghe said. Some groups gradually attempt to strengthen Provincial Councils to an extent that would affect the unitary status of the country.
He said the JHU objects the Provincial Council system as a policy. Warnasinghe said the JHU would extend its support if the government takes measures to abolish the Provincial Council system.
He added that a large amount of peoples money is spent on a single provincial council sitting.
Provincial Councillor Warnasinghe said the Provincial Councillors attend workshops on a daily basis. He said they are not organized by the government or representatives of the two main parties.

The joint opposition will hold a separate may day rally this year, Kandy District Parliamentarian Dilum Amunugama said yesterday.
He said the Sri Lanka Freedom Party members in the government will not take part. However, Amunugama did not mention the location the JO was planning to hold its may day rally.
Amunugama said, in the current context he does not see the possibility of the JO members and the SLFP members in the government teaming up together even in the event of the latter severing its ties with the United National Party. Speaking at a public event in Nugawela, Amunugama said, "we have made it clear that we will work with the SLFP members in the government even if they were willing to sever ties with the UNP. However, I believe the time has now passed for such a merger. I think it is no longer valid. It is better for us to go our own way."
He further noted that the SLFP members in the JO were prepared to face any disciplinary inquiry.
He stressed that the SLFP members in the JO knew the desire of the party members and supporters and were always willing to make any sacrifice to fulfil their expectations.

Lanka quick to adopt cashless electronic payments
Sri Lanka is the second fastest country in adopting cashless payments in the region after India Visa Sri Lanka and Maldives Country Manager Anthony Watson said.
Sri Lanka is a fast-developing economy and with the evolution of digital commerce, there is significant opportunity for the growth of electronic payments, he added.
Electronic payments is on the rise in Sri Lanka with Visa payment volumes up 22% in 2016, Visa registered a12% growth in cards and a 61% growth in eCommerce transactions, he said.
This growth comes off the back of a number of initiatives and investments made by the company in developing the acceptance infrastructure and driving awareness around the benefits of electronic payments in the country. He said that 23% of Sri Lankan card transactions are being done using credit cards and 21% via debit cards.
He said that the high internet penetration and increased use of Smart phones too is a reason for this.
He also said that currently most of the cashless transactions are being used in the leisure sector to make hotel, air ticket and restaurant purchases. In addition we also see an increase in cashless transactions for electric and household equipment purchases.
He said that Sri Lanka though moving fast in this area surprisingly frauds are notably very low. This may be because Sri Lankan banking sector has taken several meaningful steps against fraud.
The payments industry in Sri Lanka is undergoing rapid change and the electronification of payments is marking the future of digital transactions. However, personal consumption expenditure on electronic payments remains around 4.2%, which indicates there is still considerable room for growth. Visa has been in Sri Lanka for the last 29 years, over which time there has been considerable growth in the uptake of electronic payments.
We will continue to leverage our global payments network to bring the latest payment solutions to the Sri Lankan market, which is seeing a surge in the popularity of eCommerce transactions and will gradually move towards mobile payments.
Visa is committed to working with the government, merchants and financial institutions to continue to drive the growth and development of electronic payments across Sri Lanka, Watson added.

Love and Chrysanthemums
Once upon a time (not so long ago) lived a Prince in the Land of the Rising Sun who searched in vain for a bride. Im probably going to challenge Prince Charles for the gold medal in marrying late, the heir to the throne complained on his 32nd birthday. Finally, the prince sought his mother, the queens advice. The all-knowing queen, who could see into the deepest depths of her eldest sons heart simply told him, You must follow your feelings and marry Masako Owada.
Crown Prince Naruhito, the bachelor prince, had met Masako at a banquet in Tokyo. While the prince immediately fell in love with her, Masako harboured doubts about her feelings for the prince, especially as her marriage to the Prince would mark the end of her career in the Foreign Ministry. There were other obstacles to the marriage, too. A Crown Princess, by Japanese tradition, must come from an aristocratic family, be under 25, and have never had a previous romantic relationship.
The 29-year-old daughter of a diplomat did not fit these first two requirements, and the press roared with speculations on the third. Masakos life in the US and her education at Harvard and Oxford universities also came under scrutiny.
But love prevailed. On June 9 1993, as a soft drizzle fell on the leaves of the trees showering them with tiny drops of water deep in the woods of the imperial palace, the Crown Prince Naruhito married Masako Owada in a quiet ceremony, inside the Kashikodokoro shrine. It is believed that the shrine inside which three other royal couples had exchanged their marriage vows in the last century, contains the spirit of Amaterasu the Sun Goddess, who, according to legend, began the imperial line.
That morning, court ladies had dressed Masako in the formal bridal array, or juni-hitoe - literally a 12-layered garment, (a 30-pound silk kimono) that cost more than $300,000. Her hair was coiffed in classic style, with long, artificial strands added down her back.
The Japanese tiara she wore had played a previous role in another important imperial wedding: the 1959 marriage of Michiko Shoda to Crown Prince Akihito, today the Emperor and Empress, and Prince Naruhitos parents. Made of white stones, mostly diamonds with some pearls, the tiara is a large diadem in an exaggerated scroll design, and includes a perfectly matched necklace.
In an inner sanctuary of the shrine, in the presence of a few attendants: the palaces white-robed chief spiritualist, a chamberlain bearing the centuries-old sword representing the crown prince; a court lady and a priestess - the prince, who was dressed in brilliant garb from the Hein era representing the rising sun, was presented with a sacred sprig. He then read a pledge of loyalty and love to his future wife. In the hushed silence, out of view of television cameras, the two drank the sacred sake. Thus, the graduate from Harvard, the former diplomat of the Foreign Ministry who spoke five languages and had a Yorkshire terrier called Chocolate, renounced her former life to become Her Imperial Highness The Crown Princess of Japan.
That evening, the heir to the Chrysanthemum Throne and his bride took a 30-minute ride through the streets of Tokyo to take up residence at the Princes palace. The day was followed by three days of banquets.
So happy was the prince, he composed a poem for the beautiful woman he loved and courted for six years, who was now his wife.
I gaze with delight
As the flock of cranes takes flight
Into the blue skies
The dream cherished in my heart
Since my boyhood has come true
- Aditha

Mystical Thanthirimale
Cut off for three decades by the countries civil war Thanthirimale has taken on an almost mystic persona over the centuries with its boulders hiding ancient carved Buddhas and a golden bat necklace lost in the sands of time. Juliet Coombe went in search of this legendary spot and was deeply moved by this sacred haven.
The ancient site
Hewn out of solid rock
Thanthirimale 40 kms northeast of the city of Anuradhapura in the north central dry plains of Sri Lanka is a stunning sacred spot that still fascinates all that visit this sacred site. All who make this special pilgrimage comment on the scenic drive through rural countryside that takes you to the heart of Thanthirimale, an old village in the Anuradhapura District of Sri Lanka.
The name means place of the bat necklace. It is believed that a piece of jewellery of this description was hidden at a secret spot in the rock carved area about 2,300 years ago when the temple complex was built. Today local people still enjoy speculating on where it is, the size and the amount of gold used. The army who are based there have many an interesting story to tell about this legendary priceless piece.<U+2028>
Large granite boulders on a bend in the road create a natural entrance to this hidden gem of a village. It feels like you are travelling into another world, as it is so isolated and remote from the rest of the country. As you walk into the ancient site you are greeted by a grey granite moonscape littered with simple hand chiselled temple structures, lakes full of lotus, seated and reclining Buddhas hewn by hand tools out of rock faces and intriguing Brahmin inscriptions etched on the walls of meditation caves, which can be reached by a short walk through the forest. Each one with an important message impart on all those pilgrims who decide to go there at least once in their lifetime.<U+2028>
Fascinating area
The walled Bodhi tree, a sapling of the 2,500-year-old tree at Anuradhapura, is planted at one of the highest points. Test out its magical properties by walking around it and you may be granted eight wishes from good fortune to special fertility rights. Just remember to use each one well. The ancient Buddhist temple situated in a nearby rocky covered area is considered by the local village people to be Sri Maha Bodhi, which was brought from India to Sri Lanka, one night along the way the pot containing the sapling was kept at Thantheremale as it was then called. It is believed that there was one branch separately grew from the pot, was planted at that village to remember the incident. Some believe that this may be the first Sri Maha Bhodi plant in Sri Lanka. Whether it is or not the place is truly spectacular with Buddhas beautifully carved out of the giant boulders and pretty water spots make idyllic places to sit and contemplate the meaning of life, or if you are an artist a magical space to draw or do watercolours.
There is an archaeological museum at the site and some quirky little street sellers with all sorts of interesting local delicacies including squashed bat. This of course is a little joke and when you open up the green leaves there is all manner of delicious picnic style curries. As per the historical evidence being currently dug up this fascinating area is one of the oldest human settlements in Sri Lanka, which dates back according to archaeologists to pre 6th century BC, when Prince Vijaya and his men set foot on the island at a spot that came to be called Thambapanni, meaning bronze sand. A place full of mystics and magic, one cant help but feel the Thanthirimale charm that fills the air and enjoy the delicious village food that you will be pleased to hear does not included golden fried bat.
Bring your gold detector, a sense of adventure and enjoy one of the Islands great rock wonders. As one of the most incredible Sacred Cities its sure to cast its spell on you and for those who want to get away from the usual cultural triangle sites, there is something very spiritual and geographically unusual about Thanthirimale and its religious rock complex of temples and buddha carvings that makes a truly unforgettable place.

Nepal MFIs keen to emulate Lankan model
The Sakchyam Access to Finance for the Poor Programme (Sakchyam) in Nepal recently invited a Sri Lankan team from Berendina Microfinance Institute (BMI) to conduct a feasibility study to replicate or adopt the Enterprise Development Services (EDS) model being implemented by the Berendina Group in Sri Lanka.
Berendina Group Chairman Anura Athapattu and Berendinas Enterprise Development Manager. Rajesh Kanna were involved in the feasibility study conducted in Chitalang, Gulariya and Pyuthan of rural Nepal from March 20 to 24, 2017.
At the workshop held with Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) and enterprise development practitioners, it was observed that they were keen to replicate the model while Sakchyam offered all their partner MFIs a grant funding to cover replication of the BMI  EDS model, Berendina Chairman, Athapattu said on conclusion of the tour.
The BMI operation has supported thousands of families in Sri Lanka enhance income levels by implementing a unique credit plus approach. This is where credit is provided to individuals in the poorest strata of the society along with several other tied-up training services in a financially sustainable manner. As result of this, BMI was called upon to interact with Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in Nepal to explore the feasibility of emulating the model to develop and support micro and small level enterprises in that country. BMI, a non-governmental-organization is one of Sri Lankas top microfinance service providers and has a client base of over 100,000 persons spread in the remotest of regions in Sri Lanka.
Sakchyam is an initiative funded by UKaid as part of an agreement between the Governments of Nepal and the UK. It is implemented by Louis Berger for the Department for International Development (DFID Nepal) in partnership with local and international institutions. The five year programme, valued at US$ 25.77 million, is working with the public and private sectors to leverage access and facilitate financial sector development in Nepal for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and for poor people with a focus on the mid and far-Western regions (MWDR and FWDR), and beyond.

North promotes separatism: Warnasinghe
Separatism is promoted by the Northern Province and its Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran due to the powers given to it by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa despite objections by the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU), said the JHU National Organizer and Western Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe. He said the previous government gave land and police powers to the Provincial Council although the JHU objected. He added that the former President believed he could handle the matter on his personal contacts but failed.
He made this observation yesterday at a press conference held at the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) office in Battaramulla.
"MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara was a good friend of Former President Rajapaksa. So he thought he could handle Wigneswaran as he was his brother-in-law. But, when Wigneswaran went to the North he became a racist and promoted racism and separatism," Warnasinghe said.
"Now they are using separatism and racist economic policies. They say that they don't need toddy produced in the South. They also say that the fishermen from the South cannot fish in the Northern sea, but they have no problem with the Southern Indian fishermen fishing in the North, he said. He questioned as to what would happen if the Southern Provincial Councils passed a motion banning onions and potatoes from the North."
JHU Central Committee Member Ven. Budugala Jinawansa Thera and Legal Adviser Tudor Perera also participated.

NSB posts highest ever Rs. 13.3 bn PBT for 2016
The National Savings Banks operating profit at Rs. 16.1 billion recorded 4% increase as compared to the previous year.
These reported profits were achieved despite lower interest margins on account of an elevated market interest rate scenario, the bank said yesterday.
The growth in its traditional lines of business enhanced fee based income and improvement in credit quality of its asset portfolio resulting in lower provisioning being the main contributory factors leading to this growth in profitability.
Interest income of the bank grew by 11% to reach Rs. 86.4 billion whilst the net interest margin reduced to 2.9% in 2016 from 3.3% in 2015. The bank has augmented these market challenges with growth in volumes to post an increased profit. The total assets of the bank surpassed Rs. 900 billion and are currently at Rs. 911.7 billion, whilst the deposit base grew by 10% to reach Rs. 657 billion by year 2016. The banks loans and advances portfolio grew by 19% primarily assisted by advances within the retail sector. Its Non Performing Loan ratio at 1.55% testifies prudent management of its asset portfolio with emphasis on strengthening its balance sheet.
A contribution of Rs. 19.2 billion to the government in the form of dividends, levies and taxes is the highest in its history, thus signifying its critical role within the state sector. As another unique initiative, the Bank raised Rs. 6.0 billion from the local market through a private placement of debentures to strengthen the Tier II capital. The Banks Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio stood at 12.5% while the total capital adequacy was 14.7% at the end of the year 2016.

Pakistan sends rice for drought-hit Sri Lanka

Pakistan today said it will send 10,000 metric tonnes of rice to Sri Lanka which is facing its worst drought in four decades.
The first shipment of the consignment will depart from Pakistan today and reach Sri Lanka on April 3.
The Foreign Office said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has directed authorities to provide all necessary assistance to the government and the drought-affected people in Sri Lanka.
"The procedure for dispatch of 10,000 metric tonnes of rice to Sri Lanka through containerised shipments has been initiated," it said.
"The Government and people of Pakistan stand shoulder to shoulder with the brotherly people of Sri Lanka in this hour of need and will continue to provide all possible support to them," it added.
Earlier, 25 metric tonnes of rice was airlifted to Colombo on February 8 as immediate short term assistance.
Sri Lanka is facing its worst drought in four decades with more than a million people experiencing acute water shortages, according to officials.
The shortage of rain last year has lowered water levels in rivers in parts of the country.

Parents up in arms as SLTA fires foreign tennis coach
The bosses of Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA) have been at loggerheads with the parents of tennis players after they announced the firing of the Associations foreign head coach Eric Peterson.
With the SLTA higher-ups giving notice of early contract termination to coach Peterson, who was hired from Netherlands on a two-year contract to take charge of tennis players in Sri Lanka, the parents of tennis players training under Peterson, have openly expressed their anger and frustration to SLTA bosses about it.
We have been unnerved by the decision of the SLTA managers. Over and above, the children too are upset about it, a parent said.
The players have been making tremendous progress under coach Peterson when they handed the termination letter to him, a parent said. (Most parents talked to us on conditions of anonymity).
Meanwhile, coach Peterson has more than a year left on his contract.
Since Petersons ascent as SLTA head coach, the local players have won more than 20 Asian Tennis Federation Cups. The players have won Asian Tennis Federation championships in under 12, 14, 10 and 16 categories in less than eight months. Lankan players became runners up in the womens doubles at the Asian Games training along with him.
Tennis parent Suchitra Alexander, former Sri Lankan cricketer who captained the Sri Lankan Under 19 side during the tour of England, said SLTAs sudden decision to forfeit its own tennis program involving an international tennis coach of the caliber of Peterson, a man who loves the labour of his trade is still unclear to him.
The decision came out of the blue without a conversation or meeting being held with any of the stakeholders, he said.
Another parent blamed SLTA for firing the head coach at a time he has shown tremendous progress with the players. He has made such a big difference to the players. He was so close to bringing the players to the top of the game, she said.
SLTA secretary Pradeep Gunasekera when questioned about this decision to terminate the coaching program involving Peterson said, We are unable to sustain the program.
The Association has been incurring a loss of about Rs 200,000 per month over the program, he explained.
On being pointed out that it was they who brought Peterson to SLTA on a two-year contract, Gunasekera said, There are performance issues as well. We have observed that some players were dropping, and they were dropping one by one.
Most tennis parents blamed SLTA officials for not discussing the matters with them. Asked if SLTA must communicate its administrative decisions to them, a parent said, We pay 60 percent of the cost of the program. They should have made us aware.
Parents said they once saw head coach Peterson was denied entry into SLTA premises on the orders of SLTA officials. The security guards locked the gate preventing his entry. After all he is a tennis coach of international fame. This is no way to treat foreign coaches, they said.
When we met SLTA officials to discuss matters they were giving various evasive answers about the future of the game.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera had participated in one such meeting. After listening to both SLTA officials and the parents, the Minister is said to have agreed to extend a sum of Rs. 200,000 from his ministrys monthly to sustain the program for six more months.
However, SLTA bosses are keen on carrying out their decision of ousting Peterson. He continues to conduct tennis lessons while SLTA officials have reportedly appointed a new tennis head coach who, according to parents, is not qualified to handle that job. He is not even a full-time coach.
Sources close to SLTA said many tennis gear and equipment, including tennis balls, string reels, sporting apparels such as T-shirts supplied to SLTA by international organizations such as the Asian Tennis Federation and countries, such as France have gone to waste lying idle at the SLTA.
Some on this equipment are being sold fraudulently to outsiders, they said.
SLTA president Iqbal Bin Ishak categorically denied that there have been such instances.
Some parents are canvassing to retain Eric Peterson as the head coach of the SLTA. Our decision to terminate him as the head coach of the association is one reason for it. But there have never been problems of the sort, he said.
Meanwhile former tennis players and observers of the game pointed out, the main problem of the SLTA is that it does not have a player pool. There are no key gauges for player evaluation in the SLTA hence some players get undue passage to play some games while others get none.
They went onto suggest that a proper audit should be conducted into the SLTA.

The release adds: Some interested parties with personal or political agendas are carrying a disinformation campaign and falsely state that the Muslim religious places, villages and houses would be seized by the Government and the Wildlife Department under the said Gazette Notification.
These forests have been declared as Reserves under the Gazette in order to protect the forest areas adjacent to the areas released for the people as settlements to further ensure their security.
This is to inform that none of the Muslim religious places, villages or houses in which the people live and have legal rights would be seized by the Government.

The President has spoken
President Maithripala Sirisena has set the record straight. For the umpteenth time that is. Earlier, he had declared, in no uncertain terms, that he would not compromise the country's War Heroes and would not stand for a hybrid courts. He was followed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who also declared unequivocally that no War Hero would be brought before any tribunal.
But Mahinda Rajapaksa, and the Joint Opposition, were not convinced, or rather feigned to be unconvinced. They were only interested in exploiting our War Heroes for narrow political gain, assuming a monopoly as the protectors of the country's War Heroes, never mind that they unceremoniously threw the war winning army commander behind bars.
Addressing War Heroes at a function at the Defence Services School, in Kurunegala, on Wednesday, President Sirisena once again reiterated his pledge to stand by the country's War Heroes and declared that no War Hero would be subject to any inquiry relating to abuse of human rights. He said he is not prepared to make any War Hero a suspect on charges levelled against the armed forces and the government on the alleged violation of human rights during the war against terrorism. Pointing out that it is the responsibility and duty of the government to protect the War Heroes, who fought for the Motherland, the President assured that he would always fulfill his responsibility as the President and the Commander-in-Chief.
But, in the same breath, he also stressed that he was unable to protect those found guilty of acts that are not connected to national security and those who are guilty of killing media personnel and sportsmen. President Sirisena could have not been more emphatic. He has declared his stand unequivocally and all right thinking members of the public, no doubt, would approve of the position he had taken. The President has now cleared the air, and, convincingly so, and the Joint Opposition can persist with it's threadbare slogan of a government witch-hunt against War Heroes only at considerable political risk to itself.
No war is fought clean and the Eelam was no exception. To deny that there were no excesses, on the part of security forces, is closing one's eyes to reality. As the saying goes the end justifies the means and today the people from VVT to Dondra Head are reaping the fruits of peace, thanks to the sacrifices made by our forces. To completely turn one's back on these valiant men and throw them to the wolves, would, therefore, seem not only ungrateful but a treacherous act. President Sirisena, as the Commander-in-Chief, has therefore fully stood by the forces and has assured their protection, indemnifying them from any allegation of human rights violations, in the line of duty. The President's firm stand vis-a-vis the country's War Heroes, and the tone and tenor in which he made this pledge, no doubt, would have convinced the public of his sincerity. It has certainly taken the wind off the sails of the Joint Opposition which had been carrying out a campaign to portray the government as being an anti-War Heroes, based on the arrests of some criminal elements among the security forces.
The President made it clear that all those responsible for criminal acts, among the forces, would have to suffer the same consequences, as in the case of the ordinary members of the public who are arraigned before the law, for crimes. The President, no doubt, has made this distinction to impress upon the public that crime never pays, whoever may be the perpetrators. True, members of the security forces may have committed excesses in the battle against the LTTE. But these could, by no means, be categorized as cold blooded killings, as in the case of the murders of Lasantha, Prageeth and Thajudeen. These were not conducted in the heat of battle but carefully planned and executed. Hence the President's position that he will not cover such elements in the security forces will be widely acknowledged by the public.
Today, hardly a day passes without some former member of the armed forces, or a serving member, reported to be involved in serious crime, such as murder, rape, or robbery. What would be the position if the President grants blanket immunity to all armed forces personnel This is exactly what the Joint Opposition is telling the government to do. Will not such a course lead to a complete breakdown in law and order leading to a state of anarchy Members of the security forces cannot have a license to commit criminal acts just because they fought on the battlefield.
True, the question of manpower compelled the recruitment of persons to the forces without proper screening, and, needless to say, a not inconsiderable number of criminal elements found their way into the tri-forces. It is these elements that did the dirty work of politicians to get rid of meddlesome journalists and others. Therefore the President's decision to put the record straight is not only timely but also puts the whole issue in its proper perspective.

He said, to his personal knowledge, the loss incurred could have been averted. He presented an analysis of his personal view in the form of graphs and data, suggesting direct placement would have been a favourable option instead of solely an auction based system.
It was pointed out an independent witness will be summoned to the Commission to weigh the pros and cons of solely auction based method and direct placement method.

Previous regime's legacy: Seaport sans ships, airport sans planes, cricket ground sans cricketers: Sajith
A seaport without ships, an airport without planes and an international cricket ground without cricketers, were built by the previous regime, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said addressing a meeting at Lunugamwehera.
The play ground at Suriyawewa was set up by clearing a jungle.
This led to the increase of the human-elephant conflict, he said.
The minister said the seaport, the airport and the playground became white elephants as they were set up without an environment assessment and a feasibility report.
Minister Premadasa said the Mahaweli project led to the clearance of a large extent of land, but the then government relocated wild elephants in safe locations.

The woman who realised this on suspicion after removing her blindfold had followed the radiologist who left the room and snatched the phone after grappling with him.
She had later lodged a complaint with the Police after submitting the phone as proof. Police who checked the photo clips in the phone had established that the man had taken the photographs. The suspect was produced before Kandy Chief Magistrate Gihan Indika Attanayake and remanded till April 6. Investigations are continuing.

Reaching out to the needy
BasicNeeds Sri Lanka (BNSL) with roots spanning over 14 territories all over the world, completed a little over 14-years long journey in the island.
Founded in year 2000 in the UK, BasicNeeds is an international NGO which is pursuing a vision to make sure that the basic needs of all people living with mental illness and epilepsy throughout the world are met and their basic rights are recognised and respected.
Following successful implementation of initial programme to promote and protect the needs and rights of children with, and vulnerable to, mental health problems, BNSL selected Batticaloa District for their second project. The area was chosen after observing the need for such a programme for children and adults in the region, because it had been directly affected by three-decades of violent conflict  with severe physical and psychosocial impacts.
The physical needs were being gradually addressed, however the psychosocial needs of both adults and children continued to be neglected. That was exactly why BNSL stepped in.
Various mechanisms were used in addressing the issues and one of them was working with Childrens Clubs (CCs) to build resilience among children, using the Child-to-Child and Open Dialogue approaches to educating the educators about childrens wellbeing while addressing their own mental health problems.
The project wanted to create space for children to gain knowledge, capacity and agency; to accommodate childrens need for creativity, support and security.
During the Childrens Club meetings, BNSL initiated a series of information-sharing and capacity-building exercises on different subjects, beginning with organisational development aspects like how to conduct meetings, record minutes, handle finances and networking.
Participation in club related activities contributed to improved wellbeing of children as they consider the clubs a safe place, eventually fulfilling the entitys expectations.
Last year, the Childrens Clubs took up a new initiative: to look at their own community, identify pressing issues and their causes and examine how they affect childrens wellbeing. Working on a One-Year Action Plan, each club addressed or mitigated the issues while 24 MOUs have been signed between the Divisional Secretary, ESCO, implementing partner of BasicNeeds Sri Lanka and the clubs, outlining the Action Plans and the roles and responsibilities. Child Rights Promotion Officers (CRPOs) are now supporting the efficient functioning of the clubs, taking BNSLs intentions to the next level.

Resolve to implement UNHRC resolution, an act of treachery: MR
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said that the Governments resolve to implement the UNHRC resolution is an act of outright treachery practiced against the Armed Forces and the people of Sri Lanka,
Rajapaksa in a statement yesterday said that the Yahapalana government pledged to implement the entire resolution it co-sponsored in October 2015 and thereby renewed its earlier undertaking to establish a war crimes tribunal with foreign judges, prosecutors and investigators, to remove through an administrative process members of the armed forces suspected of war crimes even if there isnt enough evidence to take them before a judicial inquiry, to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and to replace it with a law acceptable to Western powers and to permit the war crimes tribunal and other mechanisms set up in Sri Lanka to obtain funds from overseas.
Though the President and Prime Minister repeatedly say that no foreign judges will be brought to try our armed forces, the pledge given in Geneva last week was exactly the opposite. The most dangerous aspect of the UNHRC resolutions of 2015 and 2017 is that the Sri Lankan government has accepted without any reservations the report of the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) of September 2015 which had accused the Sri Lankan government of a whole range of war crimes including indiscriminate killings of non-combatants, torture, rape, illegal detention, abduction and deprivation of humanitarian assistance.
There was no compelling reason for the yahapalana government to have accepted the OHCHR report other than their own inherent anti-national attitude. In 2010, the UN Secretary General commenced an inquiry against Sri Lanka and its report was published in April 2011. My government resolutely refused to accept that report and today, nobody even remembers that such a document existed.
The UN Secretary General can appoint a panel of experts to advise him on a country only on the instructions of the UN Security Council. Yet, under pressure from the Obama administration, Ban Ki Moon appointed a panel of experts to advice him about Sri Lanka without the sanction of the Security Council thus going against the practices in the UN that had evolved over seven decades.

A Royal experience!
The Royal College English Drama Society is a fine blend of past pupils and present day Royalists. It is mix of knowledge, experience, wisdom and talent. Dramatic Moves features the Royal College English Drama society where past and present join hands.
Teacher in Charge, Mrs. Lanka Ranatunga pointed out that one of their strengths definitely is the fact that the old boys are very much involved.
This is one of our strengths. They assist us with the funding, so there is no burden for the school. It is a vast collaboration with the old boys, present day thespians and prefects. So many people are involved in this, said Ranatunga.
Ranatunga also added that the school has received a lot of acclaim. When it comes to drama we have a very high rating. These students are a very dedicated set. Once they start practicing they are very committed to it. We normally have practices during the late evenings. There is the parental support and the support of the old boys, pointed out Ranatunga.
Ranatunga also stressed that Drama builds up team work and inculcates leadership qualities in the student. It helps immensely for studies as well. The students also receive training how to work with the team and address an audience. It develops their personalities and creates an all -round personality, she explained.
Capable!
President and Chairman Vinsara Jayalath also agreed that one of their main strengths is that the old boys help them.
They understand our capabilities as a school and they know this through experience having done drama themselves. The whole cast has one objective and one understanding and we all strive towards that, so we excel when it comes to team work, said Jayalath.
When it comes to drama the school has a good foundation in their inter-house drama competitions. Also they are a very resilient group of thespians.
Last year one of the main achievements was bringing the inter-house drama competition on a grand scale. The children themselves made and wrote their plays and took part. Around the World in 80 days, really was a mass production. And it was really funny and from that we did a tragedy like Julius Caesar at the Shakespeare Drama Competition and came up runners up that year, explained Jayalath.
Positive atmosphere!
Cast leader Suran Weerasekara felt that one of their strengths is that they have a lot of diversity.
Even off the stage they have very differently personalities and different qualities. So when it comes to acting it translates pretty well. The diversity of the people helps portray different roles. So you learn a lot from each other and as an experience for the actors themselves, it is something really great. That is something special I see in the Royal Cast, said Weerasekara.
The Old Royalists Association of Dramatists are aiding these thespians in terms of finances and organizing workshops. With that kind of background, there is a very positive atmosphere in the school itself and it will help us reach great heights, stated Weerasekara
The Shakepeare drama competition is very competitive and it is a great honor to emerge winners.
However this in a way has detracted from Drama itself. So many schools focus so much of their attention on the Shakespeare Drama competition alone, which is important and a great achievement. But something that we have been trying over the last few years, is not to let that competition take away from every other aspect of drama. Shakespeare is one style of drama. There are so many other varieties. It would be a bad move to isolate drama into Shakespeare alone. You can do public production workshops and collaborations with other schools. While the Shakespeare competition is important and while that competition brings out a different set of qualities, we should not forget these other aspects, explained Weerasekara.
Weerasekara pointed out that when it comes to drama, the handling of the logistics can be very demanding.
Our practices start at 4pm  5pm. It often goes on until 1.30am, the next morning. Sustaining that kind of practice on a daily basis for a couple of months is really exhausting. Throughout the period of a year doing two or three productions is extremely draining. And sometimes with all the studies, it is not fair to expect so much of the students, added Weerasekara
Weerasekera reasoned that maybe schools can reach out to a more diverse and larger set of people to take part in drama with the added benefit being that it will develop more people and it will make it easier for the others who have to apply themselves to such a strenuous routine.
Perhaps a good way to start this, is to promote drama at a very young age. Communication skills, language skills and dramatic skills can be acquired at a very young age. At that age it is so much easier to grasp this, informed Weerasekara.
The boys as a whole maintained that one unique feature of their cast is, that as opposed to having certain spectacular individuals who would carry the entire play and steal the show, their main strength is that the entire cast works together and each person contributes to making the entire performance something amazing. In 2013, when they did Tempest at Shakespeare, there was no stand out character. When they did Julius Caesar last year and came runners up, it was a similar performance.
Winning the Shakespeare is a great motivational factor
Secretary Madara Thalduwa, maintained that the parents consent goes along way.
Drama at college really matters a lot to us. So our parents have been a great help and that is another strength. Winning the Shakespeare is a great motivational factor for us. For me doing drama is a life changing experience. It improves all the aesthetic aspects of your life. It may be script writing and even directing skills.
Not so easy!
Treasurer Haathim Munas believes that where there is a will there is a way.
Balancing school work and practices can be a challenge. But when you want to do something for the school and you want to get the cup, you will do anything. You will do your studies in the morning and practise in the evening. And then next morning you go for classes. It is not easy and during those two or three months you do your best with or without sleep because you know it is important, said Munas
Lifetime bonds!
Nipun Kannangara felt that one of the great benefits is getting to know people. And that is a great experience. It is something you miss out on, if you dont do it. It is something you will regret not doing.
Yashanka De Soyza and Kalinda Abeyanayake shared the same opinion that the best experiences are the bonds you form and that is a really a great experience.

Shun blame game, work for better tomorrow: Sampanthan
Sri Lanka has a peaceful environment devoid of war. The time has come for the people to buckle down to work to develop the country without engaging in blame games for the war which is a thing of the past, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said.
The Opposition Leader expressed these sentiments when he inaugurated the 8th National Youth camp Yovun Pura at Trincomalee on Wednesday.
He said the contribution of the youth generation is vital to achieve development objectives. Sampanthan said educational and technological development has become the need of the hour as they create jobs. Since youth are the future leaders of the country, they should be led on the proper path. At a time when people of three main communities belonging to four religions live in peace and harmony, all should march together to build a new Sri Lanka, he said.
The Opposition Leader said when Sri Lanka attained independence in 1948, the country was so developed that Singapore's Prime Minister at the time said Singapore too should follow Sri Lanka's example in development. But today Singapore has overtaken Sri Lanka in the sphere of development leaving us far behind, he said. National Policy and Economic Affairs State Minister Niroshan Perera said youth had assembled at the Yovun Puraya to shoulder the responsibility of creating a country where all could live in friendship, amity and brotherhood. Those participating in the camp should take the message to their villages to muster their brethren at village level to the task of building the country and giving them the leadership.
National Youth Services Council (NYSC) Chairman and Director General Erandika Weliange said Sri Lanka remained a third world country as certain past leaders did not place confidence in youth. He said Rs. 120 million was distributed among youth attending the Yovun Pura under the Gamata Kotiyak programme.
Eastern Province Chief Minister Hafeez Nazeer Ahmed also spoke.
Eastern Province Governor Austin Fernando, Provincial Ministers, A L Mohamed Nazeer and Ariyawatie Galappeththy and Trincomalee District Secretary N. A. A. Pushpakumara were also present. The Yovun Pura attended by 6,000 youths and 110 foreign youth delegates will conclude on April 2.

SLTC welcomes third intake at inauguration ceremony
The Sri Lanka Technological Campus (SLTC) held an inauguration ceremony earlier this week (March 27) to welcome new students.
The third intake of students were officially welcomed and congratulated by SLTC President Ranjith G Rubasinghe, chief guest Prof. Lakshman Watawala, SLT Chairman Kumarasingha Sirisena, Higher Education and Highways Ministry Additional Secretary,N.K.G.K Nammawatta, and members of the SLTC faculty, and staff.
Rubasinghe said SLTC is not a campus where students just come to learn, but a place where they would leave as good, decent human beings.
"Our campus is different. We do not only impart knowledge, but it has become an extension of who we are and what we will become. Our students are not enrolled just for classroom knowledge but to become all-rounders: in academics as well as learning life skills that will make them decent human beings," he said.
The SLTC is the only corporate-powered residential campus, located at the former SLT Satellite Earth Station at Padukka. Students live onsite and experience cohesiveness and camaraderie while enjoying the cultural and scholarly resources of a research university in a landscaped 36-acre property.
The campus also officially opened a new hostel to accommodate female students from the new intake. The hostel provides all the basic facilities, including laundry services, access to a cafeteria, library, study halls, ATM machines and a brand new auditorium.
"We also believe that 'small is great' and therefore limit our intakes to ensure unanimity among our students," Rubasinghe said. "Our academic faculty is experienced and highly regarded with over decades of experience in their related fields and engage our students through exciting and modern teaching methods: Outcome Based Education and Problem Based Education. We also offer our students extra curricular activities that go beyond classroom study," he emphasized.
The SLTC has impressive affiliations with several world-renowned colleges. Lancaster University, ranked as one of UK's Top 10, Deakin University, Australia's fastest growing research university, Trinity College Dublin, the highest ranked university to engage with a Sri Lankan institute, Texas Tech University, USA's premier research university, and Georgia Institute of Technology, ranked 19 in the world for Engineering.
The SLTC also follows the Washington and Sydney Accords, which are multi-lateral agreements between bodies responsible for accreditation or recognition of tertiary-level engineering qualifications within their jurisdictions that have chosen to work collectively to assist the mobility of professional engineers.
In 2016, the SLTC was awarded ISO 9001:2008 certification for Quality Management System.
Also speaking at the event, Vidyajothi Prof KKYW Perera reiterated that a research-based campus is the ideal scenario for a good education. And together with the faculty, students must endeavour to make this Campus a world-class institution.
President of the Student Interactive Society, Mr. Akeel Mohamed (a past student of D S Senanayake College) said, "It is up to each and every student to go beyond classroom study and be a brand ambassador of this great Campus". Mohamed was the first student to enroll at the SLTC when it commenced operations in 2015.
Prof. Lakshman Watawala said that colleges like these are important for the future of Sri Lanka where students are assured of a good, affordable education, the country saves on foreign exchange, the output of skilled future leaders, and the appreciation of local educators. "These students are the future of this nation. Once they graduate, they will have entrepreneurial skills along with their educational qualifications to enable them to serve this nation."
The SLTC was set up by Sri Lanka Telecom with the motive of realizing Sri Lanka's vision of becoming the knowledge hub in Asia.
The Campus helps address the increasing demand of students who opt for a path in Engineering and Technology. Furthermore, the SLTC will bring in the much-needed hands-on corporate requirement thus transforming students into all-rounded graduates.
SLT Chairman Kumarasingha Sirisena told the graduating class of 2021 to be prepared for a world that is technologically advanced. "In 2021, Sri Lanka will be in the crux of a technological revolution: a smart world.
"During this time, the nation is going to be looking for great engineers like you. This is the time for your dream to come true, so study hard and be prepared to face a successful future."

Even as China is firmly entrenched in Sri Lankas Hambantota port, the island nation has three other major ports - Colombo, Trincomalee and Kankesanthurai - where India could collaborate for development, a Sri Lankan Minister has said in Dakhla, Morocco.
 According to Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, his government is looking at an Asian subcontinent investor to partner with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) to invest and take over the East Container Terminal (of Colombo port) in private-public partnership mode.
 India has shown interest in the East Terminal and Colombo port. Seventy-five per cent of the trans-shipment goes to India. India is looking at getting a stake in Colombo port. There are a couple of private companies that came and spoke, and we will look at them in a positive manner, the former Sri Lankan cricket great told IANS in a chat on the sidelines of an international event here.
 According to reports, the state-run Container Corporation of India (Concor) has formed a consortium with APM Terminals, John Keells Holdings and Maersk Line to bid for the development of East Container

The Teakwood Box..!
Dad asked my elder one this morning, whats happened to the cousin you used to be quite fond of, the one who was like a sister to you
Weve fallen apart! I said gruffly.
And you never tried to repair the relationship she asked.
I did, I said, but I dont think she was in any mood to work things out.
And you didnt try harder
No, I said a little defiantly.
A little like our teakwood box isnt it
The teakwood box I asked weakly.
It lay proud and beautiful in the corner of my sitting room. Its woodwork was beautiful and the brass sides and hinges shone out like gold. Visitors who came over admired its surface and spoke about its antiquity.But it hadnt always been so.
I had inherited it as a dirty old cracked box from my dad. I stored whatever I needed to hide from sight; old toys, old pillows, old blankets, and the box lay in a storeroom, musty smelling, faded and falling apart. Then one day a bearded friend, an interior designer by profession saw the box.
Bob! he shouted youve got a treasure over here!Work on it, he told his polish man.
Sir, said the man, Its useless!
Scrape it! shouted my friend.
The poor workman looked at me with resigned eyes, took out sandpaper and knife and started scraping. It had been painted and as he scraped the box, it started looking even uglier than before. Leave it, I told my friend, youre just wasting my time and money on something useless!
Carry on! he told the man and the poor fellow continued on what seemed a useless job. I watched in agony for five full days and even joked it was the paint holding the box together and it would soon fall apart, but my friend wasnt listening.
Five days later the box stood before me, shed off all its paint looking like a shorn chicken, even more unattractive and distasteful. I laughed at the ridiculous sight.
Okay, said my friend to his workman, start polishing!
I couldnt believe the transformation.
As each coat of polish went onto wood, as brass was shined and worked at; ugly duckling turned into a beautiful swan.
That was many years ago.
I stared at the box today and looked at my daughter and nodded, I knew what she meant when she felt a relationship needed the same working on, that the box had got. A broken friendship needed old hurts to be scraped away; with that would come vulnerability, before the making up and the forging of a new deeper friendship, like new coats of polish that would shine the teak and make it take centre place once again.I picked up phone and called my cousin long distance.
Bob! she whispered on the phone, and I could hear sobs over the line. I had tears as I gazed at my box and smiled at my daughter: A teakwood box was in the making..!

Thajudeen murder case: CID explains causes for delay in investigations
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appearing on behalf of the CID yesterday explained the causes which led to a delay in investigations pertaining to former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen.
DSG Ratnayake informed Colombo Additional Magistrate that the CID detectives need sufficient time since they have to unearth evidence which were buried during the past few years.
The investigation into Wasim Thajudeen murder case is a complex one and cannot be compared with ordinary investigations. The body of Thajudeen was also exhumed in order to unearth new evidence.
The investigators also have to preserve the secrecy of investigation, DSG Ratnayake added. He further added several persons including former DIG Anura Senanayake was responsible for covering up evidence regarding Thajudeens murder case. DSG Ratnayake made these remarks in response to a query by defence counsel regarding on going investigations. The defence counsel queried how long CID will take to conclude its investigation into Thajudeens murder case.
Defence counsel moved Colombo Additional Magistrate J. Trotsky a relief be granted on former Deputy Inspector General Anura Senanayake since he is in remand custody over a period of 12 months without substantial evidence to prove that he involved in the murder of Thajudeen.
Meanwhile, former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake arrested over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder and conspiring to commit a murder was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till April 5 by Colombo Additional Magistrate.

Towards a productive system of governance
Erudite writer Somapala Gunadheeras article in the press titled Selection criteria for prospective MPs, lured my attention as I myself, as a concerned citizen have been harping on the dire need to professionalise the membership of our National Parliament through my several, articles to the press, culminating with my presentation to the Public committee on Electoral reforms in January 2016.
While agreeing with Gunadheeras submissions on criteria covering age and education, I wish to, at the outset make the following observations and suggestions in regard to his comments under sub-head Control of Finance. Quite manifestly, it is the corrupt and antagonistic Preference Voting (PV) system (Not the PR system) that has compelled the candidates to muster votes by Hook or by Crook spending enormous sums of white and/or black money for their vote collecting propaganda.
It also implies that the primary job role of a national Parliamentarian includes visiting his voters in the electorates. Of course, it would have been right, in the pre-Provincial Council era (prior to 1987) where the MP was the indispensable Demi-God from whom voters were compelled to seek redress for all their issues and problems. In my view, if we perpetuate this system, all our Constitutional and electoral reforms will end up in square one. It is high time that we changed and adopted scientific corporate management principles to run this country.
As we know, ever since the advent of the Provincial Councils in 1987 with 9 provincial Parliaments, they have remained as White Elephants because the Parliamentarians did not want to severe their connection with the local voter due to the Preference Voting (PV) system. Therefore, as exhorted by the late prelate Ven. Sobhitha Nayaka Thera, the destructive PV system which anyway is optional should be abolished forthwith through a simple amendment to the relevant laws. Then, the issues mentioned by Gunadheera will not arise again.
Political administration structure
If I may expand a little more on the subject, since Sri Lanka is a very small developing country, it is befitting to embrace a simple political administration structure utilizing its human capital in the most productive manner. Unfortunately, we are already burdened with a colossal Political Administration structure though not fully of our own making. There are 4,486 politicized Local Govt. members (I have recommended them to be de-politicised) and 455 Provincial Council (PC) members at the grass root level. At the apex of the Pyramid is the Central Parliament comprising 225 Members (MPs). In other words, there is 01 MP for every 02 PC members. Is it productive We must remember that on top of it all, there is a powerful Executive President with a huge Secretariat and practically he is the final decision maker in solving many an issue coming under various Ministers!
Thus, the solution to the increasing population is not to boost up the number of MPs at the centre which is already Top-heavy, but to empower the 4,941 strong peripheral PC members and Local Govt. members with specified job roles and more financial allocations to work in the grass-root level Electorates and Grama-Niladhari Divisions. At present, the voters will still have 25 local politicians serving each of the 196 electorates.
Responsibilities of MPs
Given this saturated decentralized political Administration structure as mentioned above, the role responsibility of the 225 MPs at the Centre can be easily narrowed down to, framing and approving Countrys laws and policies in addition to approving and monitoring the National budget and financials. Visiting voters in the electorates to attend to local problems and needs should be the function of peripheral politicians - viz. Provincial Councilors and Local Govt. members.
However, for monitoring the end use of budget allocations, the parliamentarians may attend the occasional District Development Committee meetings as done hitherto. In such a scenario, the MPs at the centre should be residing in close proximity to Diyawannawa to perform their aforesaid sacred role. This step will no doubt ameliorate the present vehicle mania of MPs. Further, under a system of Good Governance, the practice of going behind politicians, seeking undue favours through MPs Chits should not arise. Indeed what was envisaged under the District Nomination system was to discourage the MP Chit system and save the MPs from political stooges and henchmen seeking undue patronage. The primary need is, to enhance the efficiency and productivity of the Public service, the Sri Lanka Police and the Judiciary in order to minimize political interventions which in their wake bring waste and corruption. It is pertinent to mention that the new RTI Act will reduce political interventions to a great extent.
Professionals in District Nomination lists
Coming back to the need for selection criteria for prospective MPs, obviously, the onus lies on the respective political parties who have been hitherto nominating their candidates on a District-wise basis, using ad hoc and biased criteria. They have to come of age and function as Professional, Corporate bodies. In order to achieve the aforesaid narrowed down objectives of Parliamentarians, it is critical for the contesting parties to select their candidates through a robust, transparent, well-structured interview system in order to field the most efficient, reliable and genuine Professionals (Lawyers, accountants, economists and political scientists - both men and women) with country at heart, who as a national team can implement the respective Party manifesto to the satisfaction of the voter and the country. If the task of publicity and propaganda is fully taken over by the party machinery, many professionals are bound to come forward.
The requirement to adopt a new set of stringent selection criteria in terms of the Code of Ethics for Nominations initiated by PAFFREL and accepted by all parties is no doubt a right step to change the existing political culture. In the same vein, we venture to propose to dispense with the existing National list of 29 members and allow the parties to include their names too in the District Party lists thereby converting the entire Party Nomination list to one National list of professionals presented on a district-basis. As a result, all parties can technically nominate 225 National candidates though it may not be practical for smaller parties to do so. To meet situations arising from premature deaths or other unavoidable circumstances, each District list may be allowed 3 extra nominations at the bottom.
The District-wise Party nomination lists should be prepared in the order of merit so that the parties can select the successful candidates in an unbiased, transparent manner, to fill the number of seats they have won based on proportionate District vote. Further, such merit list will also induce the voter to give due consideration to the quality of the candidates when deciding on his vote for a particular Party. But surely, 12 Mln. voters cannot be expected to screen these 225 people for their credentials as hitherto being done under the PV system. Therefore, logically, their optional Preference vote can be dispensed with, leading invariably to a much simpler, vote counting process as a bonus!
Party manifesto is the critical document for voting
It must be emphasized that the critical factor for voter decision should be the Party Manifesto which should be distributed among the voters together with the Island-wide nomination list, scheduled under each district well in advance of the election. Since the Party Manifesto is the vote governing document, it must be made legally enforceable through electoral reforms.
If the aforesaid suggestions are implemented, we are confident that a group of 225 honest, efficient, decent, ethical and morally rich professionals with the country at heart will be elected to the Parliament. In the presence of such professionals on both sides of the divide, phrases such as Hung Parliament and Stable Govt. will become irrelevant, misnomers.
Finally, we wish to propose that the fixed number of seats in the Cabinet also be allocated proportionately based on the national vote of contesting parties so that smaller parties like TNA and JVP too will represent the sovereign voter at all levels of Governance thereby creating a true Peoples Govt. Moreover, it provides the solution to our internationalized 13+ issue by justifying the + component.
A Paradigm shift in our political culture is imperative (It is already seen to be happening) where two sides will finally maintain a Consensual relationship rather than a confrontational stance to achieve the common objective of developing the country and its people under a system of Good Governance.
We earnestly appeal to the media, all fair minded citizens and Civil Organisations to pressurise the politicians serving in respective committees of the Constitution Assembly to re-tune their mindsets to evolve a patriotic assemblage of modern electoral reforms of our own anvil, to ensure a simple, fair, equitable and a productive system of Governance in Sri Lanka.

That same evergreen shrub grown near sea level as compared to grown at 6,000 feet can have all these different flavour profiles, explains Sidath Perera, one of Zestas Tea masters. And then by changing elements of the manufacturing process you get even more flavour profiles.
The collection of Zesta Connoisseur has several teas and herbal infusions English Breakfast (an exceptional, bright, black tea) Moroccan Mint (a Ceylon gun powder Green Tea with Peppermint leaves) and Lychee with Rose and Almond (a Ceylon black tea flavoured with Lychee, Rose and Almond).
The range also features herbal infusions like Chamomile and Rosehip and Hibiscus as well as flavoured teas such as Peach and Strawberry which are iced tea favourites.
A special feature is a range of four single estate Ceylon teas from Kenilworth, Waltrim, Shannon and Uva Highlands which embody the special taste and flavour characters that made Ceylon tea special.
Sunshine Holdings Group Managing Director, Vish Govindasamy in detailing the process that went into Zesta being handpicked by Shangri La, said, The Zesta Connoisseur collection was developed together with Shangri La, based on guest requirements. A lot of insight into unique and exclusive taste preferences, veering towards artisan, got us experimenting with new blends, especially for the range.
Needless to say, our single estate teas, picked from the highest altitudes of the fabled elevations of the Nuwara Eliya region to the misty valleys of Uva and Dimbula are unparalleled in taste and lends to a perfect brew noted Govindasamy.
