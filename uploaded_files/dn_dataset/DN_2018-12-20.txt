Lady and  the Tramp  remake features real dogs
Real dog actors are being utilized in Disneys Lady and the Tramp reboot.
Thomas Mann, who plays Jim Dear  owner of Lady (voice of Thor: Ragnaroks Tessa Thompson), the refined and pampered cocker spaniel who falls in love with Tramp (voice of Star Wars: The Last Jedis Justin Theroux)  told Collider the live-action spin on Walt Disneys 1955 animated classic is an enhanced version of the world that audiences saw before with human characters who are a little more fleshed out.
Theyre not these passing faces that you barely get a glimpse of. You get to know them a little bit better. And also, there are real dogs, Mann said.
Who doesnt want to see two real dogs kiss over a plate of spaghetti That is the main draw for me. You get the charisma of real dogs in there. Lady and the Tramp came out in 1955. I understand people who are like, Dont mess with the original, but they arent re-animating it. Its a live-action remake. So, why not
Mann confirmed the dogs were on set and filmed every day.
They were on set and they werent even trained. They found these dogs and started training them about three months before. They just wanted to find the perfect dogs, he said.
The main dogs name was Rose, who played Lady. It was crazy because they didnt know they were working, so they would run off in the middle of a take, and then come back over. You have to be extra patient because you have to be good every time for when they are good once. It was a lot of fun. It was so cute, every day, to just have a bunch of dogs to play with. It made the job a lot less stressful.
Lady and the Tramp will debut exclusively on Disney+ sometime after the streaming service launches in 2019.

The ability of silencing the mind is the key to finding the button that turns the mind on and off, in accordance with our will. When we are able to turn it off at will, we experience serenity of mind, strength, confidence and happiness. When the mind and its thoughts are quiet, we are able to use the mind in a most effective way, he said.
Controlling and understanding the thinking process, also leads to the ability to silence the mind, which is a higher stage that very few know about, and fewer take practical steps to achieve, he said.

Some  stories choose  you
The tagline of Abhishek Kapoors Kedarnath, Love is a pilgrimage, could well apply to the film itself. The Sara Ali Khan-Sushant Singh Rajput starrer has overcome financial roadblocks, inclement weather and intense litigation to finally secure a December 7 release.
Kapoors fifth feature isnt through yet. Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ajendra Ajay has protested against the films inter-faith theme and demanded a ban on its release.
Kedarnath is a love story that plays out amidst the 2013 deluge in the pilgrimage centre in Uttarakhand. Sushant Singh Rajput plays a Muslim porter who falls for Sara Ali Khans Hindu tourist  the point of contention for fundamentalists.
Kapoor has collaborated on the screenplay with Kanika Dhillon (Manmarziyaan and Mental Hai Kya). The film was born out of his fascination with pilgrimages and the harmony they represent.
If you stick around too much in Bombay and Bollywood, you just end up talking about the same ideas, Kapoor said.
If you want to tell stories for the people, you have to go and see them where they are. Instead of going for a holiday abroad, I decided to see where the people were going. A lot of them were going on pilgrimages. On one of these trips to Kedarnath, I saw so many porters carrying people every day. I found that to be really fascinating.
Faith, self-confidence and the belief that he had been picked by the god Shiva to make the film kept him going, the director said.
There are some stories you dont choose, they choose you and Kedarnath was one of them, Kapoor said.
I truly believe that I have been picked to make this film. I feel like Bholenath has picked me. Even through all the problems, I had faith and I never once thought that I would not be able to complete the movie. Everything is not a project to be trade, and I was making this film with a lot of purity in my heart.

Up to 319 people dead as Congo Ebola worsens
One of the deadliest Ebola outbreaks in history continues to worsen in the Democratic Republic of Congo with as many as 319 people now dead.The Ministry of Health said Tuesday that 542 Ebola cases had been recorded in the province of North Kivu - 494 of which have been confirmed. Of the 319 believed to have died from the virus so far, 271 have been confirmed.On average, Ebola -- which causes fever, severe headache and in some cases hemorrhaging --kills about half of those infected, but fatality rates in individual outbreaks have varied.The World Health Organization (WHO) said efforts to contain the outbreak have been hampered due to "non-engagement" from local communities and armed conflict in the region.North Kivu, which includes the cities of Beni, Kalunguta and Mabalako, remains the epicenter of the outbreak, though cases have been reported in neighboring Ituri province, according to the WHO. The two provinces are among the most populated in the nation and border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan.The public health agency estimates that more than a million refugees and internally displaced people are traveling through and out of North Kivu and Ituri, which could hasten the spread of the virus further.The Congo outbreak is the second-deadliest ever, behind only in West Africa in 2014, when the virus killed more than 11,000 people. It is Congo's 10th epidemic since 1976, and second this year.( Sources:CNN )

Army Commander Lt. General Mahesh Senanayake said there was no threat to national security from the so-called Aava Group.
He said the security forces were equipped to deal with any type of a danger to national security. Lt. General Senanayake expressed these views at a press conference held at the Mechanical and Engineering Corps Headquarters in Slave Island.
The Commander said the military apparatus was powerful and the intelligence network was fully active. Hence, there was no possibility of any threat from Aava or any other group to arise.
The Army Commander said false reports on social media about the distribution of lands to the people in North, had given the wrong impression to the public.
He added that although the Army had occupied some lands in North; those were previously owned by the people there. Therefore, the Army will take action in future to distribute lands to its previous owners as a symbol of friendship and co-existence.

According to Mathews and Mendis Rain, epic stand save Sri Lanka in NZ Test
Wellington, Wednesday: Sri Lanka battled to a rain-affected draw in the first Test against New Zealand on Wednesday after the Black Caps were unable to break an epic stand by Kusal Mendis and Angelo Mathews.
The tourists were 287 for three in their second innings -- still nine runs away from an innings defeat -- when the umpires called time with only 13 overs bowled on the final day.
Mendis was unbeaten on 141 and Mathews 120 not out at stumps after a 274-run stand that, along with the weather, allowed Sri Lanka to salvage a draw.
New Zealand will view the draw as a missed opportunity after they took control of the Test with a mammoth 578 in the first innings, anchored by Tom Latham's unbeaten 264.
Latham's epic effort overhauled former England captain Alastair Cook's 244 as the highest score by an opener carrying their bat in Test history. The emphatic performance should have given the New Zealand bowlers two full days to attack a Sri Lanka line-up that showed little fight in the first innings, but Mathews and Mendis responded with a masterclass of their own.
The pair came together late on day three with Sri Lanka reeling at 13 for three in their second dig, trailing New Zealand's first inning total by 296.
They batted through the whole of day four, fending off a barrage of bouncers from the New Zealanders in a stubborn rearguard action that, along with the weather, allowed Sri Lanka to salvage a draw.
It was the only time in New Zealand that a full day's play has been completed without a Test wicket falling, and the first time anywhere since South Africa achieved the feat against Bangladesh in Chittagong in 2008.
The partnership was also a Sri Lankan record against the Black Caps.
The draw snaps a four-Test losing streak against the Black Caps on New Zealand soil.
It will give the world's sixth-ranked team some confidence after they arrived in New Zealand smarting from a 3-0 Test series whitewash against England last month.
They have also had to contend with disarray in their coaching and selection ranks.
The fourth-ranked Black Caps entered the two-match contest buoyed by their first away Test series win over Pakistan in 49 years.
They are looking for a fourth straight Test series win after also defeating England and the West Indies in the past 12 months.
The second and final Test begins on December 26 in Christchurch, where the tourists have never won in three attempts.AFP

Apples $1 bN Austin campus latest big investment from top tier companies
Major corporations such as Apple, which just announced a $1 billion investment into a new Austin campus, are buying into Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott told CNBC Friday.
The iPhone maker promises to develop a 133-acre complexto hold 5,000 employees, with room for an additional 10,000 more. It will be situated within a mile of Apples existing facility in the Texas capital.
The Republican Abbott shrugged off Amazons decision last month to pass on cities in his state in favor of locating its second headquarters on the East Coast, split between New York and Virginia.
The week after Amazon made that announcement, McKesson ... announced it was moving its headquarters from San Francisco  to the Dallas-area in 2019, the governor said on Squawk Alley.
In addition to Apple and medical supplier McKesson, Abbott said software giant Oracle opened a massive campus and investment firm Pimco announced an artificial intelligence facility  both in Austin.
Those are just two of dozens of examples of whats happening in Austin, Texas, just this year, Abbott said, referring to the Oracle and Pimco projects.
The first-term governor said companies like Amazon, who purchased Austin-based Whole Foods, and Apple are turning to Texas for its access to top tier universities in the state and low taxes.
Abbott also touted Texas, which topped CNBCs 2018 Top State for Business list, as the leading choice for companies leaving California.
He cited a Dallas Business Journal article that reported that 13,000 businesses have left The Golden State since 2008 for a better business climate, with most settling in Texas.
Convenience store distributor Core-Mark, Toyota Motor North America, and Charles Schwab are a few other names that have moved their corporate offices or opened regional hubs in North Texas, according to the article.
If I can use a football analogy: Texas is the Alabama when it comes to recruiting in college football, Abbott said. We get to pick the 5-star recruit companies that are coming to the Lone Star State. (CNBC)

BALL IN HER COURT
Where there is a will, there is a way, proves Rashmi Taniya Perera. The 17-year-old student of St Josephs Girls College, Nugegoda, was ranked world #1 in the FIBA Under 18 Women 3x3 Individual World Ranking list with 131,355 points recently. She had dribbled past all odds to reach this feat after her sterling performance at the Youth Olympic Games held in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
She had taken to basketball from grade three. Though she had given up the sport for a short span after witnessing the demanding nature of the game played by her seniors, she got back on track while she was in grade six. Standing tall at 55 Taniya says that she continued playing basketball due to her mothers encouragement.
She saw me shooting baskets and noted that I have a knack for the sport, Taniya explained.
She took part in the Under 17 all island tournaments when she was in the Under 13 category in 2014/15, playing with and against basketball players who are much more senior than her. Her skills for the game soon earned her the opportunity to captain the under 16 national team in 2017. She had also captained her school team in the Under 15 age category. She is currently the Vice Captain of the Sat Josephs Under 19 team. Her first international tournament was in 2016 when she took part in the 23rd FIBA Asia U18 Championship for Women in Bangkok, Thailand. Though she scored only around two baskets in that event, it marked the beginning of a great journey.
Rashmi Taniya PereraPicture by Chaminda Niroshana
Recalling some of her best performances Taniya noted that she performed exceptionally well in the Under 23 Asian Games, the FIBA 3x3 Under 18 Asia Cup in 2017 and the Youth Olympics. She also added that she did well in the Under 19 and Under 17 National in 2016. She is in the Under 19 first year now.
I have scored around 30 to 34 in the nationals. Between 20 to 24 shots has been my highest score in an international match. I have scored around 11 or 12 shots in a 3x3 match, Taniya said.
Though she has shown talent to play any kind of shot in any position in the team, Taniya is mainly placed as a Point Guard. The Point Guard is also known as the one. He or she is typically the teams best ball handler and passer. They often lead their team in assists and steals. They are able to hit shots either outside the three-point line or in the paint. Point guards are also known as the coach on the floor, Taniya elaborated adding that the one who scores is decided on the offense of the opposition team.
Taniya had been trained by Ajith Kuruppu and Sivashakthi Selvaraja. Her first national coaches are Prasanna and Buddhika. She had also been trained by Shane and Anton. She says that they have advised to send as many straight passes as they possibly can so that the opponents will not be able to tap the ball.
You need attitude to excel in the game. There needs to be understanding among your team members because it is a collective effort that will win the game. Respect your coaches. Be alert. It is a tiring but rewarding game, she said.
Reflecting back to some of the words of wisdom given by her coach Sivashakthi Selvaraja, Taniya said that he had asked her to give each game her 100 percent.
A game only lasts for about one and a half hours. So you need to make the most of that time while you are on the court. Keep up your confidence and you will succeed, she said.
Taniya had been ranked #2 in the FIBA Under 18 Women 3x3 Individual World Ranking prior to the Youth Olympic tour. She had made it to the top of the list soon after returning back from the tour.
I had been asleep when Selva Sir called us to give the good news. Later my mother shared the news with me. She was so emotional there were tears in her eyes. I was elated, Taniya added with a smile.
Being awarded at the SLT Silk Sports Award Ceremony 2018
She won the SLT Silk Sports Award for basketball this year. Apart from basketball Taniya is into athletics too. She is also a Senior Prefect. Her father, Kokila Nandana Perera, is working abroad while her mother, Nimesha Dilrukshi, is a housewife. Her brother, Nipun Nishara Perera, is a champion sprinter and was the Games Captain of St Johns College in 2013. Taniya is following her G C E Advanced Levels in the Arts stream.
Queried if she hopes to travel abroad for further training if the opportunity comes her way, Taniya says that it is up to her coaches to decide on which path she should choose. Her ambition is to become a judge and excel as a senior national player.
I admire Hussein Bolt and former American basketball player Kobe Bryant. However my hero has been Selva Sir from the beginning of my school days, she said.
Her words of advice to youth with diverse talents are to believe in themselves and their capabilities.
Do not back out. Believe in your talents and move forward. Your talents and determination will help you come on top of the game one day, she advised.

Dip powder nails: These arent exactly new per
se - theyve actually been available in salons for years - but thanks to social media, the manicure is staging a comeback. Think of them as somewhere
between a regular manicure and a fake nail

Baby Bangs: Theyre certainly not for everyone, but as the photos for cropped bangs prove, when you go short, the payoff is big.

Glossy makeup: After years of liquid lipstick, the tides are turning and its lip glosss time to shine again.
Standout lips: Well, this one seems kind of obvious. When isnt bold lipstick in


Almond nails: It looks like were all ready to put coffin nails to rest. Almond nails - long nails that come to a rounded point - is gaining momentum for 2019. It makes sense, given that the shape makes your fingers look longer.

Going gray: 2018 was a big year for embracing your natural grays. Celebrities like Chrissy Teigen, Jessica Biel, and Katie Holmes all did it on the red carpet, while women at home shared their own personal gray journeys. The trend will continue in the New Year.

Drinking water in an empty stomach in the morning helps in boosting metabolism. It also helps in getting rid of the body toxins. And the plus point it will also keep you full so that you wont be wanting to eat more.
Also, drinking water benefits skin, kidneys, weight loss. If you are bored of plain water, you can always have raw fruits and veggies. They are rich in water and will keep you hydrated too.
Control the salt intakeIt is very important to keep a check on your daily salt intake.
This point also suggests you avoid the salty foods that we are usually very fond of.
Foods like chips, pakoda, pickles are all rich in salt which increases our sodium content. These high sodium foods even lead to water retention.
So keep the salt shaker away. And a better idea is to replace it with Himalayan rock salt, which has come out as a healthier option.
Starving can never healthy weight loss
To become slim doesnt mean you will have to stop eating.
That is the worst thing to do. Your body needs nutrition to function properly and nutrition comes right from the foods we eat.
So starving can never be the solution. To become slim and get away with that weight, just choose the right foods.
We need a balanced diet for proper regulation of the body. So, go ahead and eat but be mindful of it.
In fact, starvation can make you fatter.
Exercises
To become slim, you have to sweat a little. Yes, if you are up to it, make a routine of some kickass exercises. Push-ups and squats are always advised.
For the ones who are already into it, try going for cardio exercises.

Always go for post meal walks
If you are one of those lazy bums like me who keep looking up how to become slim without exercises then make after meals walk as a habit as this is not something very tough you dont even have to go to gym.
Just take 15 minutes walk right after your meals. Walking just post your meal is more effective in weight loss.

A bestselling swimming  elephant
Donald Trunk and The Curse of Crabzilla will be launched on Wednesday January 16 at 3pm at the Jetwing Lighthouse

What do a top art director; top hotel and travels chairman, top white tea plantation manager and top photojournalist have in common They are all coming together in one of the top hotels in Galle, Jetwing Lighthouse with top new childrens book character, Donald Trunk, Sri Lankas Swimming Elephant for the launch of his latest adventure and to tell us the secrets to writing a bestselling book. 
Last year Donald made his debut at the Fairway Galle Literary Festival Art Trail in an incredible art exhibition of illustrations by Donald Trunk book artist Janet Anderton, who brilliantly captures the adventures of this fascinating character. He is a fictional personality that is based on a real life news story about three run-away swimming elephants, which swam ten miles out to sea before being brought back by the Sri Lankan navy. Much to the delight of Trunk fans who loved the theatrical performance of the book in English and Sinhalese, Donald returns in fine fashion, surfing his way towards being a social media celebrity on Tusk Book, delighting kids around the world with his new trunk selfie skills, while teaching them a thing or two about Sri Lankas amazing history. Like at the launch of the first book, Donald Trunk and The Curse Of Crabzilla takes us into a fascinating world of wonderful wildlife characters, like the bandit crab that gets turned into Crabzilla by accident, the wise Jiminy cricket-like butterfly, Natasha, a cheeky monkey, and Donald Trunk himself.
This years 2019 book launch will be an even more special event, with the second childrens book in the series of eight, featuring more characters doing more fascinating things, entertaining both adults and children in various glorious rooms in the Jetwing Lighthouse, a flagship hotel among Sri Lankas Premium range of hotels. There will be no better way to start the New Year off than with a magical childrens story about Sri Lankas most iconic animal, the elephant.
Monica Lawrie, astronomically talented Art Director; Shiromal Cooray, Jetwings Chairman and Managing Director; Juliet Coombe, author of the Donald Trunk book series; and Herman Gunaratne, manager of the best white tea plantation in Sri Lanka and famous author of five top selling books, will all be converging, like stars coming into alignment, for this great launch and will be giving audiences the benefit of their significant expertise and experience in producing the book you want to write if only you knew how. So, do join them for a fascinating behind-the- scenes presentation, addressing all of your unanswered questions. After all everyone has his or her own unique tale to tell; its just unearthing that story line and finding what you want your message to be. But where do you start What should inspire you How can you become a good writer And then how do you design it so it is eye catching and sells. Monica Lawrie will give us an international perspective after a decade of publishing in Australia and Herman Gunaratne will reveal the brutal realities of being a writer in Sri Lanka, with a global following.
After the talk, Juliet Coombe will launch her book over tea and a very special elephant cake mapping Trunks big trip across the world, one of many splendid illustrations from the new book Donald Trunk & The Curse of Crabzilla. In a brief reading, we will learn that Donald Trunk, Sri Lankas Swimming elephant is at it again; swimming back to Sri Lanka from Nicobar and then setting off in search of the mythical elephant graveyard treasure in the highlands of Sri Lanka, after doing back breaking work rebuilding the ancient tanks of the Second Kingdom. Why did he leave paradise on Great Nicobar Island, home to endless miles of breathtakingly beautiful beaches and a phenomenal protected biosphere of wonderful wildlife creations One of these extraordinary creations is the peculiar robber crab, a species that doesnt much like water, loves climbing trees to get coconuts and is an unrepentant thief of silver, and all things shiny, from peoples houses, into which he breaks, enters and nonchalantly helps himself, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. This robber crab turns into a monster after Donald has an accident in a secret cave laboratory and becomes obsessed with getting Donalds tusks to add to his treasure collection. He spends the rest of the book in hot pursuit of Donald, like the terminator, in some hilarious circumstances.
In this new episode, Donald Trunk is many things; a dreamer, an idealist, a one-elephant expeditionary force and, during the course of the story, ends up trying to be the redeemer of his ancestors. Full of hilarious twists and turns with him pretending to be an Italian fountain to escape being captured by the police, not fitting into a passport booth to get his picture taken and discovering to his disgust that Jumbo jets do not carry elephants. The book is a collection of events and characters that revolve around four different cultures on two continents and is highly entertaining for children and those who enjoy a great story.
During the talks, the children will be entertained by the gifted hotel chefs who will teach them how to make incredible animal shapes out of food and several other exciting artistic activities, which will take place by the reflecting pool of the hotel. So come along and join this action packed afternoon on Wednesday January 16 from 3 to 5pm at the Jetwing Lighthouse, where they are aiming to assemble the largest elephant gathering in the world, in the form of artistic pieces brought along by children or created on the day, depicting elephants in their myriad of different forms. The most amazing artistic pieces will win prizes and the overall winner will go with their parents on a two day safari, where they can see real elephants and one or two of the other characters depicted in the book. - SK

Brexit is destroying Britains Constitution
Whatever the outcome, Brexit has triggered an irreversible collapse of Britainspolitical, legal, and social order.
Two events last week changed the Brexit game. On Monday, the European Court of Justice ruled that the United Kingdom could unilaterally cancel its decision to leave the European Union before signing a withdrawal agreement. Then on Wednesday, Conservative members of parliament called a vote of no confidence in their leader Theresa May (who leads the party as well as being prime minister)and lost. They only mustered 117 votes to unseat her, while she secured the backing of 200 Conservative MPs. According to Tory party rules, she now cant be challenged for another year: Instead of deposing her, theyve given her a year of magical leading.
The first development strengthened remainers, and the second gave the prime minister vital breathing space that could theoretically be used to advance their agenda.
But despite the fervent hopes of remainers, nothing that happened last week makes an exit from Brexit more likely. Instead, Brexit compromises conceivably capable of bridging the countrys divides, such as the Norway plus option proposed by moderate Conservative MP Nick Boles, are now harder than ever to reach. Meanwhile, Britain is teetering more wildly than ever on the edge of an outright constitutional crisis.
Lacking a written constitution, Britain has always relied on what we might call alternating majoritarianism for political stability. One party gets in and is allowed free rein to do what it wants. The fact that the British public generally has taken a dim view of parties it considered too extreme has generally forced these supposedly all-powerful majority parties away from their members views and toward the political centre. And under Britains first-past-the-post electoral system, centrist third parties face structural hurdles that prevent them from making headway.
Working majority
That system is now broken. It relied on the big Conservative and Labour parties being able to win working majorities that limited MPs ability to rebel against their party lines. Theres no point in 10 or 15 MPs rebelling when a government has a majority of 50. All it achieves is to damage the rebels prospects of promotion. But that system has been fatally undermined from multiple directions.
First, the strength of the Scottish National Party has made working majorities a thing of the past. It made its breakthrough in 2015, after an independence referendum it lost, but at which it vastly exceeded expectations. Its geographical concentration allows it to win Westminster seats in Scotland, and without Scottish seats its almost impossible for the two big England-based parties to win a working majority.
Without a working majority, party leaders must pay attention to their hard-liners, or, as some Conservative Party members have been known to call them, swivel-eyed loons. The loons forced David Cameron to offer a referendum on Britains EU membership, which he, as everyone knows, narrowly lost.
Normally, Britains flexible political system could accommodate one partys indulgence of extremism: if the Conservatives found themselves advocating something radical such as leaving the EU, this would typically open up space in the centre for Labour to position itself as the defender of economically pragmatic close relations with it. However, Labour is currently led by the far-left and anti-European Jeremy Corbyn, keen to facilitate Brexit and take advantage of the economic chaos to implement a radical socialist agenda.
Superimposed on these new, more polarized parties are the new, essentially sectarian political identities created by the Brexit referendum itself.
Leavers and remainers move in different social circles and have different understandings of the central facts of Brexit. Though there are still pragmatists in the centre, political careers are now made by appealing to the tribes core beliefs.
Thus Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, a remainer in 2016, has now declared himself unafraid of the harshest, no deal Brexit, while former Education Secretary Justine Greening has been working on bringing about a new referendum since Theresa May sacked her in the summer.
Anti-Europeans
This is the context in which to understand the rampant reports of conspiratorial plots within the Cabinet: remainers plotting a new referendum (and seeking legal advice on whether Britains decision to leave could be revoked by executive action, without consulting Parliament) and anti-Europeans threatening to resign from the government, reject the withdrawal agreement Theresa May negotiated with the EU, and leave without any sort of deal at all. (The Bank of England estimated that such a disorderly Brexit would cause unemployment to almost double, inflation to rise to more than 6 percent, house prices to fall by 30 percent, and the pound to fall below parity with the euro.)
Britains constitutional crisis running in parallel to its Brexit debate has made it much harder for any of these plots to come to fruition.
There is no majority for any policy at all in Parliament. Whereas Cabinet resignations were once accompanied by the prospect of the resigned minister and her entourage joining the leaders opponents in a vote of no confidence, Mays year of immunity has closed off that option; resignation will just produce ex-Cabinet ministers, fuming on the back benches without a ministerial car and salary.
The true limits of their power now revealed, no-deal Brexiteers are now contemplating a legislative strike, which would deprive the government of its majority for everything except confidence votes, or even forming a new hard-right party.
That would allow them to vote against the government in a confidence vote and provoke an election. The effect of a new party would, however, be to split the anti-Labour vote and give Jeremy Corbyn a good chance of entering Downing Street.
Second referendum
But nor is there any easy path to a second referendum, as remainers hope. If nothing changes, Britain will leave the EU on March 29, 2019. Holding a referendum requires an Act of Parliament, and thus continuous control of the legislative timetable to avoid a filibuster. In practice, that too requires a change of government, as well as for the EU to grant an extension to the Article 50 negotiating period to allow one to take place.
Even if remainers managed to get this far, referendum proposals would be accompanied by intense and polarizing debates about the referendum question (or questionsa two-stage referendum has been suggested), the franchise (one prominent anti-Brexit group wants to give EU citizens in the U.K. and British citizens in the EU the right to vote in it), the regulation of political spending, and the conduct of a campaign. Extreme Brexiteers have already begun civil disobedience, though their competence leaves something to be desired.

Britain in Brexit limbo with 100 days to go
UK: British MPs head off for Christmas with just 100 days to go until Brexit, leaving a country in limbo with no divorce deal in place and total confusion over what happens next.
Prime Minister Theresa May, who is holding her last question session of the year in parliament on Wednesday, has delayed a crucial vote on her Brexit deal to next month.
Jeremy Corbyn, head of the opposition Labour Party, has accused May of trying to run down the clock so MPs will have to choose between her deal and crashing out of the EU.
While the politicking continues in Westminster, many Britons are putting their lives on hold and delaying major financial decisions until the future becomes clearer.
Retailers are complaining of a slump in sales in a normally busy period as Britons contemplate a post-Brexit future in which government forecasts say they will end up poorer.
More than two years after a deeply divisive referendum and after months of negotiations with Brussels, the indecision of the countrys leadership is also frustrating for many.
Theres an overall mood of pessimism in the country at the moment, said Tom Clarkson, research director at BritainThinks, which conducts surveys on public feeling.
Brexit is the worst kind of politics. Its very Punch and Judy. Its the kind of Westminster politics people hate. In ordinary conversations this Christmas, the word Brexit is being replaced by the euphemistic The B-word to avoid groans of despair or a revival of long-running family feuds.
Experts agree that May is likely to lose the vote on her deal, but are divided over what might happen next as there is no majority in parliament for any alternative option.
Without a deal before March 29, Britain will still leave the European Union in a chaotic end to its 46-year membership that could trigger a financial crisis.
A cabinet meeting on Tuesday stepped up planning for a no-deal scenario, after which Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson informed parliament that 3,500 troops would be on standby to help with any contingencies.
Despite the apparent economic risks, some hardline Brexit supporters back a so-called managed no-deal Brexit -- leaving without an overall agreement with the EU but with individual ad-hoc deals to minimise disruption.
Many MPs are instead calling for a second referendum to end the impasse and give Britons the chance to think again.
May has ruled this out as deeply undemocratic since 52 percent voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.
Another possibility that has been raised by cabinet ministers in recent days would be for parliament to hold a series of non-binding votes on different Brexit options, giving MPs greater influence on Brexit strategy.
With no clear plan, a sense of desperation is setting in.
British rock star Damon Albarn recently joined with other prominent public figures to call for a citizens assembly to decide what to do next if the British parliament cannot.
As Christmas nears, even the Church of England has remarked on the turbulent events surrounding Brexit.
The bishops of the Church of England pray for national unity -- and courage, integrity and clarity for our politicians, they said in a statement.
There is now an urgent need for the United Kingdom to recover a shared vision and identity to help us find a way through the immediate challenges. - AFP

Christmas treats!
The Yule log is a specially selected log burnt on a hearth as a Christmas tradition in a number of countries in Europe. Whether you call it a yule log, chocolate roulade or Bche de Nol, this decadently creamy festive showstopper makes a highly popular Christmas dessert. Try out this recipe this Christmas.
Method
1. Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/gas mark 4/350F.
2. In a large, clean bowl whisk the egg whites until thick and peaking, then, still whisking, sprinkle in 50g /  cup of the caster sugar and continue whisking until the whites are holding their peaks but not dry.
3. In another bowl, whisk the egg yolks and the remaining caster sugar until the mixture is moussy, pale and thick. Add the vanilla extract, sieve the cocoa powder over, then fold both in.
4. Lighten the yolk mixture with a couple of dollops of the egg whites, folding them in robustly. Then add the remaining whites in thirds, folding them in carefully to avoid losing the air.
5. Line a Swiss roll tin with baking parchment, leaving a generous overhang at the ends and sides, and folding the parchment into the corners to help the paper stay anchored.
6. Pour in the cake mixture and bake in the oven for 20 minutes. Let the cake cool a little before turning it out onto another piece of baking parchment. If you dust this piece of parchment with a little icing sugar it may help with preventing stickage, but dont worry too much as any tears or dents will be covered by icing later. Cover loosely with a clean tea towel.
7. To make the icing, melt the chocolate  either in a heatproof bowl suspended over a pan of simmering water or, my preference, in a microwave following the manufacturers guidelines  and let it cool.
8. Put the icing sugar into a processor and blitz to remove lumps, add the butter and process until smooth. Add the cooled, melted chocolate and the tablespoon of vanilla extract and pulse again to make a smooth icing. You can do this by hand, but it does mean you will have to sieve the sugar before creaming it with the butter and stirring in the chocolate and vanilla.
9. Sit the flat chocolate cake on a large piece of baking parchment. Trim the edges of the Swiss roll. Spread some of the icing thinly over the sponge, going right out to the edges. Start rolling from the long side facing you, taking care to get a tight roll from the beginning, and roll up to the other side. Pressing against the parchment, rather than the tender cake, makes this easier.
10. Cut one or both ends slightly at a gentle angle, reserving the remnants, and place the Swiss roll on a board or long dish. The remnants, along with the trimmed-off bits earlier, are to make a branch or two; you get the effect by placing a piece of cake at an angle to look like a branch coming off the big log.
11. Spread the yule log with the remaining icing, covering the cut-off ends as well as any branches. Create a wood-like texture by marking along the length of the log with a skewer or somesuch, remembering to do wibbly circles, as in tree rings, on each end.
12. You dont have to dust with icing sugar, but I love the freshly fallen snow effect, so push quite a bit through a small sieve, letting some settle in heaps on the plate or board on which the log sits.

The case of narrow-minded politicians
The situation in our country was very tragic. This you will realize when you speak to your friends. When you watch television, read newspapers there was clearly a political crisis. This placed our country in an economic crisis. International community laughed at us. There was a debt crisis.
Ignoring all these disasters, politicians were in an enormous power struggle. We fervently believe that none of these senior politicians could take our country out of this tragic situation. They had no plan. They had no commitment. They were not dedicated. They did not love the motherland. They wanted power for their personal benefit. They wanted to hide their weaknesses and frauds.
The main reason for this is that the senior politicians had been very narrow-minded. A narrow-minded person is not willing to listen to or tolerate other peoples views. They are prejudiced. A narrow-minded person has a mind firmly unreceptive to new ideas or arguments.
Open-mindedness helps you learn and grow.
The politicians lacked tolerance or breadth of vision. They were unwilling to consider alternative ideas, perspectives or thoughts.
We hope the new parliament will be broadminded and listen to other views and new ideas.

The third was that she was presenting a Budget formulated with the contribution if the largest number of council members in history.
She said that even though presenting a Budget was a constitutional need accomplished in terms of section 211 of the Municipal Council Act, it was proper to describe the Budget as the Councils vision and the Management plan.

Contraction in Net Indirect Tax impacted economic growth-Analyst
Sri Lankas economic growth slowed to a two-year low 2.9% after averaging 3.5% yoy for the past four quarters according to report by Economic Analyst of HSBC Aayushi Chaudhary.
Statistically, part of the slowdown can be explained by a contraction in Net Indirect Tax (NIT) collections, which pulled down GDP growth by 40bps, the report adds.
The rest of the weakness in growth numbers can be explained by slower growth in services and continued weakness in the industrial sector.
In fact, services alone explain 50ppt of the fall in growth from the previous quarter. However, it has had a healthy run so far, growing for six straight months on a sequential basis. We would therefore not read too much into the latest print, awaiting further data to see if its just a blip, he said. Gross value added (GVA) measure of growth came in at 3.3% yoy, stronger than 3% in the same quarter last year but much lower than 4% last quarter
Industry, on the other hand, has been weak for some time now, averaging under 2% yoy so far in 2018. Though manufacturing and mining had an unfavorable base this quarter, on a sequential basis, too growth failed to impress.
Agriculture continued to grow smartly, led by rice, coconut, cereals, vegetables and rubber cultivation.
In the October policy meeting, the central bank had increased policy rates by 50-75bps to neutralize the impact of a 150bps cut in Statutory Reserve Ratio. Given low single-digit inflation, a moderation in credit growth and below trend GDP growth, we expect the central bank to keep policy rates unchanged over the foreseeable future.

Critics brand DC film  wannabe Thor
Warner Bros has finally unveiled its standalone Aquaman film, directed by James Wan, after what seems like an eternity of promotion.
Having made his debut in 2016 film Batman v Superman, the character  real name Arthur Curry  is only just receiving the solo treatment in a spectacle starring original Game of Thrones actor Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman and, in what was originally a secret role, Julie Andrews.
Compared with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the majority of films released as part of the DC Extended Universe have had a fairly rough ride with the critics: Batman v Superman was maligned, as were mash-ups Suicide Squad  which starred Jared Leto as Joker  and Justice League.
The jewel in its crown thus far has been Wonder Woman, the Gal Gadot-starring period adventure which made Patty Jenkins the most successful female director of all time.
But whats the verdict on Aquaman If the first reactions were anything to go by, it seemed the fish king could sit alongside Wonder Woman as a DCEU success story - however, the consensus among professional critics has been far more lukewarm, with IndieWire branding the character a wannabe Thor.

Die cast for lawmakers
The old adage says, The watched pot never boils. But, eventually every law abiding citizen in the country is convinced now that water had been boiling well in the supreme pot. The whole country had changed into a melting pot of ideas and even the Simple Simon contributed his share at the village tea-kiosk seemingly very accurately than some lawyer turned politicians and veteran parliamentarians.
Most of the people in our country are now politically mature. What they lament for now is their childrens future. They very well know that the sons and daughters of our patriotic politicians who exploit their much needed adrenalin for the sake of the country do their studies in foreign universities. Their golden logic is that there should be leaders after them to rule the country!
Love for motherland
When one spends a short holiday in a foreign country, he or she feels a great love for motherland. The very reason is that the people in the host country express their sympathy towards our country. I am sandwiched and better roasted now because whenever I meet a Sri Lankan or any citizen they sympathize with me for the sorry state of affairs in our motherland. The power hungry politicians with their shortsightedness have dragged our motherland to an unprecedented precipice.
The innocent citizens are not responsible for this calamity. But, now it is heard on numerous grapevines that people are waiting to pass a serious message to those fakirs and lebbes who ruled the country since independence and made politics a gold mine and Eldorado. An Elnino is looming over them in the dark sky.
Executive presidency and legislature
The die is cast. So, it is high time for the would be leaders to turn swords into ploughshares. Our per capita income has reached the bottom. Trade deficit is hopeless. Our foreign assets are dwindling. Brain drain is in progress.
Investors are turning a Nelsonian eye. Our image abroad has been badly tarnished. Future seems to be bleak. The executive presidency and the legislature should go hand in hand irrespective of visible and invisible differences. Democracy should be upheld at any cost. Judiciary has to march unblemished with the nation. Above all, people have to give vent to their opinions without fear or favour. Hearing of the backlog of cases in the courts should be expedited.
This is the best of times, this is the worst of times.

The brainchild of two self-proclaimed Foodies, the initial social media platform for Foodies Lanka was a WhatsApp group that kept growing in number as the duo tried out different places and cuisines every Friday night after their church young adults meetings. Eventually the growing popularity of the group meant a transition to a larger social media platform of Instagram and Facebook. Soon the duo was also approached to transform their experiences for lifestyle magazine audiences with specialized food columns.

It is amazing how food has brought together so many people. What started out as simply me and my wife loving to travel and eat, has now branched out to so many avenues. If you have a passion for something, money or resources is the least stumbling block for you to worry about. With Gods grace you can actually do whatever crazy idea you can think of. Always remember though to keep God in the center of everything. With Him nothing is impossible, he added.

GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer merge healthcare arms
The firms are combining their consumer healthcare businesses into one firm with annual sales of 9.8bn ($12.7bn).
Other brands involved in the deal include Aquafresh toothpaste and Chapstick lip balm.
The deal still needs approval by shareholders and regulators. Shares in GSK rose 7% on the news.
GSKs consumer healthcare division used to operate as a joint venture with Swiss firm Novartis, but it acquired full control of the business nine months ago.
GSK, which will have 68% of the new business, said the deal was a compelling opportunity to build on that earlier buyout of Novartis and deliver stronger sales.
Through the combination of GSK and Pfizers consumer healthcare businesses, we will create substantial further value for shareholders, said GSK chief executive Emma Walmsley.
Ultimately, our goal is to create two exceptional, UK-based global companies, with appropriate capital structures, that are each well positioned to deliver improving returns to shareholders and significant benefits to patients and consumers.
The joint venture will go by the name of GSK Consumer Healthcare. Apart from GSKs Nigerian subsidiary, which is excluded from the deal, it will operate in all countries where GSK and Pfizer have a presence.
GSK will have six directors on the board, while Pfizer will have three. The new firm will be spun off and listed separately on the London stock market within three years.(BBC)

Fueled them to find all the energy they need to be active and have lots of fun during the vacation.
What is breakfast
The word breakfast is really two words, break and fast.
Fast is when you dont eat food, and all during the night you have been sleeping and not eating. So, breakfast is when you break your fast by eating. Your stomach will be very happy about it and your body will be able to use the food to get the energy it needs.
Why is breakfast important

What you eat is turned into energy by your body. If you dont eat when you first get up, then your store of energy is low, you cant think or work as well and your stomach keeps letting you know that it is waiting for food! By the time morning break comes along you are starving.

Some breakfast ideas
Whatever happens or whatever you do during your day, it is a good idea to have something to eat when you wake up.
*Whole meal toast, cereals and eggs all provide the power (energy) your body needs to get through the morning.
*Milk and other dairy products are especially good for growing bodies and healthy bones.
*Having a toaster can mean that you get something warm without having to stand over the cook top.
*Using a blender to blend fruit and milk into a smoothie can give you a quick, easy meal with lots of goodness.

ICTA to launch Spatial Data portal
Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) announced the launching of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) system soon as part of a national initiative for effective decision-making.
The system is based on amassing available geographic data scattered with many government organizations and making use of this data to enhance the accessibility, communication, and use of geospatial data to support a wide variety of decisions at all levels of society.
NSDI is a platform that maintains an updated spatial database intended to create a common environment where all stakeholders and the public can corporate with each other, access relevant data as well as contribute in providing relevant data for others to use.
Sri Lanka is fast moving into being an information and knowledge society  especially with the emphasis on Information Technology and transparent e-governance. The next decade will see further large-scale investment in communications technology as Sri Lanka moves to exploit the full potential of the information age.
Among the variety of datasets that would be involved, spatial (or map) information will be a major content. These Spatial information sets are vital to make sound decisions at the local, regional, state and central level planning, implementation of action plans, infrastructure development, disaster management, and business development.
The NSDI platform is expected to benefit decision makers especially in the areas of natural resources management, flood mitigation, environmental restoration, land use assessments and disaster recovery. More specifically, it is expected to deliver benefits in the following areas; NSDI will contribute in solving major agricultural issues such as whole farm planning and natural resource management. Sri Lanka faces a host of environmental problems such as land degradation, pollution, poor management of water resources, loss of biological diversity, coastal erosion, increasing scarcity of water for agriculture and improper water disposal polluting agricultural land etc.
The effective use of available spatial data will help in protecting the environment along with balancing the increased development in the agricultural sector which will in turn lead to higher productivity and profitability.
Land Use: NSDI will enable land use planning for sustainable utilization and management of land resources. Maintaining a common platform with essential data about lands can contribute immensely in protecting them and avoiding land use conflicts.
Archaeology: NSDI provides reliable data on the countrys archaeological sites, their boundaries, entrance restrictions and buffer zones etc., to ensure smooth management of our heritage sites.

As much as 85 per cent of the planes would be narrow-body and the rest would be wide-body. The forecast is for the 2018-2037 period.
According to Boeing, India would need 1,940 single-aisle planes worth USD 220 billion and 350 wide-body aircraft valued at USD 100 billion.
Around 10 regional jets worth less than USD 1 billion would be needed during the 2018-2037 period.
India continues to grow at a faster pace, Dinesh Keskar, Senior Vice President (Asia Pacific & India Sales) at Boeing Commercial Airplanes said here.
He also noted that aviation market in India is quite challenging as most airlines are not making money even as there is strong passenger growth.
India is the fastest growing domestic aviation market in the world and registered 50th straight month of double-digit growth in October.

Japan plans tighter  regulation of tech giants
apan is planning to tighten regulation of tech giants like Google and Facebook after an expert panel called for better oversight on competition and privacy, an official said Thursday.
Japan has followed in the footsteps of other countries in scrutinising the dominant role played by the worlds largest information technology companies, including Big Four tech firms Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.
The government has now issued a report based on expert opinion that urges new regulatory oversight plans by next year.
Despite bringing benefits, tech giants tend to monopolise the market through their features such as... low costs and economies of scale, the report said.
It calls for better protection of consumer privacy and for more fairness and transparency from the firms about technologies that control market access.
Based on the report, the government will officially announce principles for new regulations in the next two weeks, a trade ministry official told AFP.
Japans anti-trust authorities have already said they plan a probe into whether global tech firms are using their market leader positions to exploit contractors or obstruct competition.
Japans decision to tighten regulations comes as European authorities crack down on US tech giants.
Earlier this year, the European Union issued a record 4.34 billion euro ($5 billion) anti-trust fine to Google, accusing it of using the Android systems huge popularity to promote its Google search engine and shut out rivals.
Google has appealed the decision, arguing that the EUs accusations were unfounded, but said last month it would comply with the decision in order to avoid further fines.
And the European Parliament in September approved a controversial EU copyright law that hands more power to news and record companies against internet behemoths like Google and Facebook, though the firms have pledged to fight that ruling. (PHYS.ORG)

Okay, we know this topic has been done and dusted and we exclusively brought you Reema Kagtis version saying that Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (ZNMD) sequel is not happening. But let us just admit, we so want a sequel to ZNMD. And so does Katrina Kaif!
Recently, when we met the actress over a conversation while she was promoting Zero, the actress spoke at length about the characters she played that are her personal favourite. No points for guessing - Laila from ZNMD topped the list. Kat even said that every time she meets Zoya Akhtar, she tells her that she should write a sequel. We so resonate with the thought.
Katrinas other favourite characters from her filmography are Zoya from Ek Tha Tiger and Indu from Rajneeti. On playing Babita in Zero, Kat said that her role was difficult and emotionally tiring.
Is there one role on Katrinas wishlist Well, shed like to play a mythological character in a fantasy drama. We hope to see that soon!

BOSS joins forces with artist Jeremyville on a new collection and campaign for the holiday season. Sleek BOSS design collides with playful Jeremyville artwork in a limited-edition collection, featuring a cityscape inhabited by a unique cast of characters.
New York-based artist, product designer and author Jeremyville has garnered international and critical acclaim for his playful and thought-provoking imagery created in a distinctive, cartoon style. He has created one of his signature cityscapes exclusively for the BOSS holiday campaign.
The bustling metropolis is a city that doesnt sleep  especially when there are gifts to be found and night after night of celebrations to attend. The four inhabitants represent a playful take on traditional holiday preparations. The lead characters include his now iconic bunny, and, to celebrate Chinese New Year, a pig.
These bold designs are printed in bright color on leather sandals, backpacks, document holders and phone cases. The HUGO BOSS logo and Jeremyville illustrations meet, as the cityscape is printed over a fully monogrammed Italian coated-canvas backpack.
In a more understated interpretation, the characters are printed into leather accessories, leaving a relief design. A grainy leather backpack showcases
the Jeremyville bunny, a sleek sneaker is detailed with a raised pig motif, and sartorial loafers feature an all-over embossed cityscape. Small accessories including phone cases and leather luggage tags also feature in the collection.
The individual characters come into their own as key charms and figurines. Available as single pieces, the figurines are also stackable, creating a new totem-like take on the Christmas tree.

He said the matter will be raised at a meeting at the health ministry today and added that he was confident the issue can be sorted out.

Man City survive shoot-out to reach League Cup semis
London, Tuesday: Manchester City survived a penalty shoot-out to reach the League Cup semi-finals as young keeper Arijanit Muric starred in the dramatic finale to the holders' win over Leicester on Tuesday.
Pep Guardiola's side took the lead when Kevin De Bruyne marked his return from injury with a fine finish in the first half at the King Power Stadium.
Marc Albrighton cancelled out De Bruyne's first goal since April with a late equaliser to set up the 3-1 shoot-out win.
Muric, making his second City appearance in place of the rested Ederson, stole the spotlight as the 20-year-old Kosovo international made two penalty saves to clinch his team's last four berth.
Just hours after Guardiola's old rival Jose Mourinho was sacked by Manchester United after their worst start for 28 years, City could afford to make eight changes and still went through as they chase the third trophy of the Guardiola era.
No wonder City fans cheekily chanted "bring back Mourinho".
"A tough game, it is always difficult at Leicester. We played with a guy (Eric Garcia) who is 17 years old and some injured players, but it was a good game," Guardiola said.
De Bruyne added: "I feel stiff but I am happy to contribute. To be out for so long and to play 70 minutes is a good sign for me.
"We want to win titles so there's two games more and we can battle for another trophy."
City had 87 percent of the possession in the early stages and their pressure was rewarded in the 14th minute.
De Bruyne took control on the left edge of the Leicester area, cleverly shifted the ball onto his right foot before unleashing a low drive that zipped through the legs of Hamza Choudhury and past goalkeeper Danny Ward.
It was a cathartic moment for De Bruyne in only his seventh appearance of a frustrating season ravaged by two knee injuries.
The Belgium midfielder was making his first start since being injured in City's League Cup win over Fulham on November 1. Riyad Mahrez was making his first return to Leicester following his move to City in the close-season.
The Algeria winger almost doubled City's lead when he pounced on Brahim Diaz's shot and smashed a volley just over.
Muric kept his side's lead intact when he sprawled to the left to repel a long-range drive from Demarai Gray that appeared destined for the bottom corner.
Sergio Aguero, back from an injury that sidelined him for three weeks, should have put City two up moments after half-time.
However, the Argentine forward shot too close to Ward after running onto Mahrez's pass.
Leicester drew level in the 73rd minute when Wilfred Ndidi lofted a pass that picked out Albrightons run behind Oleksandr Zinchenko and the substitute slammed a fierce strike into the far corner.
Guardiola's men had beaten Leicester on penalties at the same stage of the League Cup last season. Leicester had more recent spot-kick success after beating Wolves and Southampton on penalties in the previous two rounds, but it was City who prevailed again.
Leicester's Christian Fuchs and City's Raheem Sterling both shot over.
Muric seized the moment with saves to deny James Maddison and Caglar Soyuncu before Zinchenko drilled in the winner.
Third tier Burton are into the semi-final for the first time in their history after a shock 1-0 win at Championship promotion chasers Middlesbrough.
Sixth in the second tier, Middlesbrough made a host of changes and were punished by their lowly opponents.
Burton, 15th in League One, are the first team from the third tier or lower to reach the semi-finals since Sheffield United in 2014-15.
Jake Hesketh put Nigel Clough's side into the lead in the 48th minute, the on-loan Southampton midfielder firing home from the edge of the area. AFP

The new Cabinet of Ministers will be sworn in today, President Maithripala Sirisena had announced yesterday, nearly two months after the backdrop of the ongoing political turmoil in the country.
During a meeting of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Parliamentary group yesterday evening, the President had said the new Cabinet of Ministers will be sworn in today, Parliamentarian Nishantha Mutuhettigama said.
Mutuhettigama said the UPFA Parliamentary group had discussed about its future political plans but refused to divulge details.

Parliament
TNA rails against Speaker
There are two Opposition Leaders in the current Parliament, TNA Leader R.Sampanthan told Parliament yesterday.
The TNA Leader making a special statement said that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has not removed him from the Opposition Leader'S post though he announced about the appointment of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Opposition Leader on Tuesday.
Sampanthan also pointed out that it is alleged that former President Rajapaksas Parliament seat has fallen vacant as one month has lapsed since he ceased to be a member of the SLFP after obtaining the SLPP membership.
The person recognized by the Speaker as the Opposition Leader does not even hold the position of MP as of the date of such recognition. This again suggests the Speakers decision has been taken in haste and it is in violation of our Constitution, said Sampanthan.
He pointed out that the Speaker recognized him as the Opposition Leader in September 2015 and August 2018 and that the Speaker held that it was his final decision.
He further said that there is no need to recognize another person as the Opposition Leader in haste in a context where Cabinet is not yet constituted and Government is not yet formed.
The TNA Leader also held the view that appointing a member of the UPFA as the Opposition Leader while its Leader Maithripala Sirisena is the Head of Executive, Head of Government and Head of Cabinet is incongruous and such matters must be sorted out through a Parliament Select Committee.
I urge early corrective action, in the interest of the country as a whole, be taken to preserve the sanctity of our Constitution, he told the House.
Following Sampanthans submission, TNA MP M.A.Sumanthiran tabled three newspaper articles on November 12 which carried the story of former President Rajapaksa ceremonially obtaining the SLPP membership on November 11.
He pointed out this event was held two days after the purported dissolution of Parliament by the President.
UPFA MP Susil Premajayantha making his submission said former President Rajapaksa has neither resigned from the UPFA/SLFP nor he was expelled from the party.
He also held that the Speaker has no authority to appoint a Parliament Select Committee for the above mentioned matter as per the provisions in the existing Constitution.
He said that there is no evidence to claim that Rajapaksa obtained the SLPP membership except few newspaper reports. At this point, Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella asked Premajayantha as to whether he obtained the SLPP membership or not. Premajantha denied obtaining the SLPP membership.
However Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunathilake showed to the House the photos of the former President and his fellow MPs obtaining the SLPP membership.
SLMC Leader Rauff Hakeem pointed out that Parliament is in chaos again as Sampanthan challenges the Speakers announcement over the appointment of Opposition Leader. Former President Rajapaksa became the former Prime Minister and now he has become a former MP. Once you obtain the membership of another party, automatically your membership ceases. This will be proven before a Parliament Select Committee. One of the most popular political leaders in this country has been made a political orphan. Unfortunately, that is what you have done, he said.
However, TNA Leader Sampanthan did not assume the seat allocated to the Opposition Leader yesterday and was seen seated on a front row seat near the main entrance. The seat allocated to the Opposition Leader remained empty. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was absent. Speaker Karu Jayasuriyas ruling on the Opposition Leader post is due tomorrow.
Country needs new Constitution - Eran
UNP MP Eran Wickremeratne participating in the Adjournment Motion on the abolition of the Executive Presidency said that he hopes that President Maithripala Sirisena, putting the country first, would cooperate with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in appointing the Cabinet and assist in the process to bringing the country back to normal.
Wickremeratne also said that the draft of the new Constitution should be presented and taken up for debate without allowing others to make boogey-men out of it.
He also said the country need a Constitution that is agreeable to everybody and which treats all communities in an equal manner. Wickremeratne said there were Jumbo-Cabinets in Sri Lanka and a small country like this does not need such a large Cabinet. Wickremeratne also said that they are dedicated to working without destroying the hopes of the innocent people who flocked to Galle Face Green recently to celebrate the re-establishment of democracy in the country.
Without a proper foundation, we cannot erect a strong building. From 1978, we have been amending the Constitution, but anymore amendments will not do. We need to put up a strong foundation for the betterment of our future generation, Wickremeratne pointed out.
He also said that some President's who promised to abolish the Executive Presidency attempted to keep that position for a life time.
Quoting from the Mahinda-Chinthana 2005 and 2010, Wickremeratne pointed out that the Executive Presidency has been used to postpone elections, ban political parties, topple legal governments, pardon murderers and promote an assassination culture.
According to Wickremeratne, Rajapaksa in his election manifestos has promised to make the Executive Presidency answerable to Parliament and would participate in Parliament sessions once a month.
Wickremeratne pointed out that Maithripala Sirisenas manifesto states that the Executive Presidency will be abolished in keeping with the vision of Ven.Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera.
JVP urges MPs to support abolition of Executive Presidency
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Bimal Ratnayake joining the Adjournment motion in Parliament yesterday, urged all members of Parliament to support the move to abolish the Execute Presidency which gave excessive power to an individual, which is detrimental to the country.
He said they are amused to witness the Opposition Members, who tried to throw chillie powder and fling chairs at the Speaker, praising him when he appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Opposition Leader.
During the past three years, we saw members of the Rajapaksa clan playing double games as they are seen with Mahinda Rajapaksa during the day and at night, they are with President Maithripala Sirisena in the hope of obtaining benefits from both sides. We objected to their double standards on the basis that they should either be in the Opposition or with the Government, but not playing both sides. We were criticized claiming that we were supporting the UNP, but we are not a party which could be influenced by any side. We take our own independent decisions. We have a strong stand and we discuss matters, while taking appropriate action.
Referring to the Rajapaksa camp as a shameless group who abused the Speaker in the most despicable language, Bimal said it was amusing to watch how they are now praising the Speaker and claiming that the Speakers decision is final. Hence, he asked the UPFA members to kneel down and worship the Speaker and plead for forgiveness.
He noted that the peoples power should not be underestimated. Today the peoples' power is evident when we see the manner by which Mahinda Rajapaksa lost his premiership and how he is now struggling to hold onto his post as the Opposition Leader and even his Parliamentary membership. The Rajapaksa clan, just like leaders of the other party as well, always acted to hold onto power. Hence, they always took hasty decisions, he said, adding that the President got himself into a mess by trying to hastily dissolve Parliament.
Ratnayake noted that two days after Parliament was dissolved, Mahinda Rajapaksa got SLPP membership and now he is facing a pathetic situation. Now he is making all excuses and even stating that he did not take SLPP membership. These are utter lies. One must have a backbone when doing such things. They made a big show when they took SLPP membership by putting it up on twitter, FB and other social media. Now they are denying that they took membership in another party. They have no backbone at all.
He said the Rajapaksas had used State media and certain private media to promote their news. But he said they were not aware that social media and the peoples conscience is much more powerful. They failed to see this and thought they could influence the people through these handful of media institutions.
Commenting on the Executive Presidency, he said the UNF is now trying to get together with the President and even bribe members from the Opposition and form a government.
But that is not relevant to us. We said in our road map that even the current government had no ethical right to be here as they have now taken in the same rogues and based on such grounds, we need to go for an election. But now the President had apparently said that ministerial posts would not be given to those who crossed over from his camp. This is also not a good thing. If anyone crosses over to the Presidents camp from any party, he has the right to give them ministerial posts, but when they cross over to the other UNF camp, he wont. Hence, there are many reasons why the Executive Presidency should be abolished. The powers of the Presidency should be used for the benefit of the country, but today it is evident that it is being used for his own benefit. But today we have the weakest President in the entire history of this country. He does not have Parliamentary support nor the vote base. But based on just the provisions of the Constitution, see what a lot of destruction he could do just to safeguard his position. Therefore, we suggest that power should be vested under a Prime Minister (be it Wickremesinghe or otherwise), he should maintain that 113 on a daily basis.
He said after 1977, when there were only the two main parties, they always received the majority. But after 1994, no party got the majority except in 2010. Hence, the political reality is that the majority can only be obtained through coalitions. Therefore, under a Premiership, the government would have to obtain the support of other parties, no matter who the Prime Minister is he will have to listen.
Hence, he urged all Parliamentarians to support the move to abolish this executive Presidency which is a cancer that destroys democracy.
Ven. Rathana Thera, MP Hettiarachchi clash in House
A heated argument broke out between Independent MP Ven.Athuraliye Rathana Thera and UNP MP Wijepala Hettiarachchi in Parliament yesterday.
The argument broke out towards the end of Adjournment Debate on the abolition of the Executive Presidency. Ven. Rathana Thera intervening in the speech of MP Hettiarachchi said President Maithripala Sirisena's policy statement clearly mentioned that he would not make any Constitutional changes that require a referendum.
MP Hettiarachchi said that the President on numerous occasions had pledged to abolish the Executive Presidency.
If late Ven. Sobitha thera was alive, he would curse you. You could come to Parliament because the UNP accommodated you. We should put a full stop to the crossovers. You had been in the Government enjoying all the privileges and then switched allegiance. I am also a good Buddhist who had passed the Dharmacharya exam, Hettiarachchi said.
Ven. Rathana thera replied that he did not receive any privileges from the government and did not do any injustice to the UNP. He said that his principle is to object to what is wrong and support what is good.
Motion to increase number of ministers
There had been discussions in the UNP to present a motion to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to increase the number of ministers to 35.
A senior UNP MP said that there had been discussions on forming a National Government again with the support of a group of SLFP MPs.
The 19th Amendment to the Constitution restricts the number of ministries to 30 and this number can only be increased with the approval of the House when a National Government is formed.

Professionals back President to abolish Singapore FTA
Professionals National Front (PNF) Secretary Kapila Perera said all professionals will support President Maithripala Sirisena if he takes action to abolish the Singapore - Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement which is detrimental to the country.
While speaking after the appointment of Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister recently, the President categorically said that the way in which the Singapore - Sri Lanka FTA signed was wrong, he added. Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he further said the Commission that was appointed to investigate the Singapore - Sri Lanka FTA has also noticed that there are many shortcomings in the agreement.
Former Minister Malik Samarawickreme signed this agreement without the consent of Parliament or Cabinet bringing shame to the country. The President seems to be of the opinion that the agreement should be abolished and it should be reviewed by a panel of experts and the intellectuals again.
We urge President and the Prime Minister not to appoint former Minister Malik Samarawickreme to the same post again, he said.
GMOA representative Dr. Danushka Devapriya said Sri Lanka until now has signed FTAs that only covered goods. However, this agreement opened the countrys service sector to foreigners.
The law in Singapore updates frequently while it is stagnant in our country.That is why the service sector in our country must be protected.Former Minister Malik Samarawickreme cannot understand the value of professionals and has betrayed the country by signing this, he added.

Pros and Cons of Crossovers
It looks as if the game of political acrobatics at which our honourable peoples representatives are much adept at has commenced in earnest once again. A sample of this was witnessed on Tuesday when four UPFA MPs crossed the great divide to take their seats among the ranks of the new Government of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in Parliament. More are expected to follow, according to media reports as the Government consolidates itself enabling it to obtain a working majority in Parliament.
In fact UNP front liner Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has asserted that the UNF has the required 113 seats to form its own Cabinet, according to our main story yesterday. He (Dr. Senaratne) added that there will be more crossovers to the UNF Government from the UPFA. This is if one considers past trends in the Lankan political scene. Nay, we dont have to go very far. The post-October scenario saw the swearing-in of crossovers as ministers or deputies almost on a daily basis at the Presidential Secretariat, making a mockery of representative Government. Now it will be the other way round with the pole vaulters bound to trot out the usual yarns to justify their actions.
This naturally entails yet another bloated Cabinet, as witnessed under the Yahapalanaya and before that, which if eventuates would result in more burdens on the tax payer and blame on the new Government. MP Vijith Vijithamuni Soysa of Appachchi fame, one of the foursome who defected, stressed that they took the plunge out of the love of the people and not in expectation of any Cabinet portfolios. It is left though to be seen how long these good intentions would last. So far no crossover (almost always from the Opposition to the Government) has done so out of true altruism. It is rarely that we come across politicians of the calibre of Gamani Jayasuriya.
In the meantime President Maithripala Sirisena has thrown a spanner in the works for those among his party ranks planning to jump ship. According to another account in our front page of yesterdays edition the Central Committee of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party has unanimously approved President Sirisenas decision not to grant ministerial portfolios to SLFP MPs joining the new Government. A senior party spokesman was also quoted in our report as having stated that a motion was presented to the Central Committee seeking disciplinary action against MPs who cross over, though a final decision in this regard would be taken at a future CC meeting.
Of course, this so called disciplinary action against crossovers is old hat to those who are acquainted with past instances involving such disciplinary action against MPs of one party ditching their party to make common cause with the enemy. One recalls the crossover of Nanda Mathew, Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Susil Moonesinghe and Wijeyapala Mendis all of whom broke ranks with the UNP to throw in their lot with Chandrika Kumaratunga on the eve of the 1999 Presidential Election. The UNP went before the Supreme Court seeking expulsion of the renegades only to be overruled by a Bench presided over by Chief Justice Sarath Nanda Silva, on the grounds that this as an infringement of their (MPs) basic rights. The UNP also failed in its exercise of expelling the 18 UNP MPs who decamped in 2008 to strengthen the hands of Mahinda Rajapaksa and in the process provide him with the numbers to enact the 18th amendment to make him virtually President for life.
Thus, in the event of any contemplated disciplinary action against the would be SLFP crossovers, leading to expulsion, they are bound to seek the intervention of the judiciary by invoking the above precedents. There is also the fact that the SLFP and President Sirisena failed to take disciplinary action against the SLFP MPs, including Mahinda Rajapaksa, who bore membership of a party (Pohottuwa) that not only challenged the SLFP but also contested an election (Feb. 10 LG poll) as a rival to the Blue party pushing the latter to third place behind the UNP. It is not clear how the courts would view this whole process of selective penalizing.
Be that as it may, it is time that something is done to put a halt to this despicable act of changing sides. Apart from being morally objectionable is also a distortion of the peoples will. When one votes for a candidate of a political party it is on the understanding that he/she will be true to the party and stand up for its principles and protect the interests of the party. Ditching the party midway and joining a rival party is a clear act of treachery that should not be permitted. The recent saga demonstrated to what degree our so called honourable members had sold their souls, leaving the electors in the lurch. The agreement signed between the UNF and the UPFA/SLFP when establishing the Unity Government in September 2105 prohibited crossovers while the arrangement lasted. It looks as if it is party-time once again.

Ringgit ends higher against US dollar
The ringgit closed higher against the US dollar prompted by greenbacks weakness, amid the sell-off in US equities, dealers said.
At 6 pm, the local note traded at 4.1750/1800 against the US dollar compared with Mondays 4.1790/1830.
A dealer said stocks on Wall Street recorded a new low for the year in overnight trade as worries about the economy continued to weigh on investors sentiment ahead of a crucial US Federal Reserve decision on interest rates later this week.
The sell-off came after another indication that the American economy, while still strong, is showing signs of slowing down, he said.
Meanwhile, OANDA Head of Trading Asia-Pacific Stephen Innes said the US dollar remained incredibly susceptible to weaker US economic data and extension of the US equity market sell-off.
The US Federal Reserves rate hike probability for December remains at 64 per cent but doubt is starting to build given the severity of the recent equity market meltdown, he added.
The ringgit, however, was weaker against major currencies.
It eased against the Singapore dollar to 3.0439/0486 from 3.0388/0440 on Monday and fell against the Japanese yen to 3.7141/7192 from 3.6865/6910.
The local unit weakened against the British pound to 5.2810/2890 from yesterdays 5.2651/2714 and depreciated against the euro to 4.7491/7564 from 4.7340/7393.

ROUGE ready!
Festive season, the busiest time of the year with countless events and parties, has arrived! With Christmas just around the corner and the New Year too looming ahead it is a good time to start thinking about your party looks and makeup kits that will help to make you sparkle all through it.

Attire for the season 
Colours like red, green dull gold and silver always makes things so much more Christmas-like, and its a great pick-me-up as well for this season. A red shoe, a scarf or a necklace is all you need to dress with holiday spirit. Or go all out in a red satin sheath dress or sparkly red cocktail dress.
For a more casual holiday gathering, a satin wrap top is the perfect choice when you want to be festive but not too dressy.
A three-strap, cutout detail in a classic V-neck top creates a stylish, asymmetrical effect. Wear this for your office holiday lunch or out for cocktails with the girls. For casual holiday outings, a cross body bag will keep everything in its proper place with plenty of interior organization. 

Festive make up 
They say the festive season is the most wonderful time of the year, and thats especially the case when it comes to your beauty routine. If ever theres a time to experiment with sparkling eyes, bold lips, and a major glow, the holiday party circuit is certainly it. Take inspiration from Instagram and start practicing the flick of your wrist for your cat-eye and get searching for your shade of new berry coloured lipstick.

Trendy looks for a diva 
Matte red lips and winged liner: A few things are as timeless and classic as a winged liner-red lip combo. If you love being the life of the holiday party, go full out with a red glitter lips. To recreate an eye-catching pout, swipe a red lip color over your mouth and then top it with superfine, crimson-coloured glitter.
Define the outside corners of your eyes with a black kohl liner, then use a blending brush and black eye shadow to smudge it out for a smokier cat-eyed look. Use your finger to dab a gold, glittery shadow on the middle of your eyelids and the inner corners for the finishing touch.
If normal holiday colours arent your thing, try copper and bronze shades instead.

Hair styles that are in this season 
Holiday hair doesnt have to involve sparkly pins and headbands but thats half the fun. There are plenty of simple party-ready styles out there.
When you want unfussy, not-trying-too-hard hair with subtle volume at the crown, a loose, looped knot at the nape of the neck works best.
Crown braid is one of those effortlessly elegant updos that says stylish, not stuffy.
The best part about half-up hair is that you only need to worry about the bottom. Secure the top center section of your crown into a miniature bun, then take a curling rod to the rest.

Accessorize your nails 
Its not the most innovative nail art idea ever but a punchy Christmas red goes with everything.Chrome nails too will never get old.
The easiest way to inject a little festive shimmer into any ensemble is to don holographic silver nails which are in vogue right now.
Give your regular French manicure a festive update with taupe nails and silver glitter tips.
Get your Christmas nail art on with rose gold and black glitter ombr.

Handy hints for socialites 
From sequin dresses to velvet jumpsuits, there isnt one right way to do Christmas or New Years Eve in style. You can find something fun and sparkly or give your go-to LBD a jumpstart with a new pair of over-the-knee boots or floral pumps. No matter what path you take, the point is not to hold back.

Must try beauty trends
* Underliner rides strong for another season, now in the prettiest palette of icy, metallic blue and gold. * Try the Golden Cupids bow. Nothing feels more regal than a touch of gold on a velvet red lips.
* Every season, theres always one perfect messy bun which turns heads.
* Go for the Cut Crease Liner with your eye showdown this season.

*eauty must-haves you need to have in your purse
* Its always a good idea to carry a lip stick to retouch your lips during the night.
* A compact powder always comes in handy.
* Slide blotting papers into your clutch to control excess shine and oil as the party goes on without messing up your makeup.
* Mini perfume bottles are my favorite thing to keep in my clutch, handbag and makeup bag. They always come in handy.

Tips to choose your festive accessories 
In most situations, choosing jewelry and accessories is mostly a matter of finding pieces you love and pairing them with the right clothing. However, selecting holiday jewelry can be a little more complicated. For one thing, the selection of seasonal jewelry is huge and constantly expanding. Youll find everything from coordinated necklace and earring sets to novelty items like themed pins and necklaces. All these choices make shopping fun, but so many options can also make it challenging to figure out how to wear these pieces. These guidelines will help you figure out how to incorporate holiday jewelry into your look.

Know your style 
Your everyday style generally reflects your personality, so if you get to zealous with the holiday pieces, you may feel uncomfortable.

Consider the occasion 
The type of occasion should be a factor in choosing any type of jewelry, and this is just as important during the holidays. Even if a piece has a holiday theme, it may not be appropriate for your event. For example, avoid wearing flashy Christmas buttons and brooches to a dressy cocktail party.

Less is more 
When it comes to holiday jewelry, its easy to get carried away and end up looking like a Christmas tree. One way to prevent this fashion disaster is to remember that less is more. You want each item to attract attention, not blend in to create a cluttered appearance.

The season for giving gifts wrapped in partial belief
As many enjoy the Christmas cheer, rugby celebrates another remarkable season with the top team favourites very much in control.
Kandy despite all the pre-season hype are still very much the team to beat.
Havelocks, CR, Navy and CH certainly have their work cut out ...to outplay and out run the defending champions...
Coach Lewke will certainly need prep time and bigger forwards to match their age and counter paths ....and different thinking to be a real force in Asia.
For us Sri Lanka rugby hearts everything in Asia, realistically within our grasp.
Sri Lankas U19 team showed plenty of promise in the build-up to the Asian championships. Unfortunately fact and fiction separate that dream in the middle as we just found out last weekend with the U19 championships in Taipei.
Sri Lankas chances with their running game made them certainly contenders at the start but after playing the hosts they rapidly deteriorated and lost badly to Hong Kong.
Our last game against Korea highlighted the lack of impact caused and a predictable shyness to tackle up front.
We have to learn and adequate preparation for the right quality and skill that match Asias best. It should be the soul criteria in selections especially at youth level.
Sri Lankas best chance and challenge in Asia is at this level ...there should be a given priority by professionals of Sri Lanka rugby.
The club season remains solid despite continuous expert Ho-haaa..
Expectantly having fits and starts by the contenders...especially Havelocks despite losing 11 players at the start of the season ...remain unbeaten till they played Kandy at the cauldron in Nittawella.
If a team needed to show guts and courage they were the classic example in the best Havies tradition.
Coach Martis and captain Niroshan must be happy for the teams commitment, work rate and drive for the 80 mins in the middle.
The Kandy-Havies game was easily the best seen over the last ten years.
All you hear about the grand support in Kandy ...its true ...the intimidation and pressure on a visiting team certainly starts to show by the end of 65 mins and the raucous performance by Kandy for their fanatical faithful make it very difficult to survive.
Consistency and in the last quarter by Kandy has broken every team so far ....Havelocks being the latest victims on Sunday..
The defending champions remain unbeaten and coach Wijesinghe must be partly confident whatever happens in round 2.
Remarkable to consider the brilliant form Tharindu Ratwatte and Sam Maduwantha has been enjoying so far.
It is a remarkable fact that both kickers are lapping up classic attention for all their hard work and preparationas ball players they are second to none and a great example of professionalism for all young players graduating from school....
Ratwatte and Maduwantha are both from the hill capital and currently are the toast of Sri Lanka rugby with their accuracy and consistency.
The exceptions separate the average from the remarkable.
Players like Rudangamuwa for Kandy, Danushka Ranjan and skipper Richy plus Roshan Weeraratne and Khalhara make Kandy the toughest combination in club rugby ..
For teams lining up against defending champions will always be a requirement to try and match the Kandy front forward 8..in the set and the line-up.
Kandy are unstoppable with their ruck and maul game and have been able to grind the life out of all packs that played against ..to beat Kandy you need to break Kandy ...theres nothing left to chance or luck and pressure the entire hinge of the results.
From my calm deck chair trying to estimate Kandys performance away from home is challenging itselfcan they maintain this stupendous form and work rate away from home
...and outplay Havelocks, CR, CH and Navy to grab the league title of 2019 ...your guess is slightly better than mine, and the odds still sting enough to want speculation.
Much has been said about Kandys professionalism over the last decade and we continue in the same vein ...with team performances at the league.
Kandy have smashed opposition defenders with alarming regularity.
Little wonder that they remain unbeaten and huge pride for the lions.
For Havelocks the remarkable had turned around despite the lack of big impact players and mains.
Riza and his educated boots still providing plenty for the park club to cheer about...
For CR and CH, like I said last week have their own mountains to climb and plenty of work ahead if they are to be considered in the super league rounds ...
CRs Omalka Gunaratne providing maximum impact for his forward 8...
CH& FC has skipper Yoshitha, Muthuthanthri, Sathya, Henry and Sasanka for impact on any given day. Unfortunately the big stars failing to deliver consistent results from match one has resulted in CH finding themselves No.5 rather than top two with a mountain to climb in round two.
Maduwantha has rapidly carved himself a reputation as a reliable kicker and is beginning to add the much needed spark to CHs performance.
Lets hope their match against Police SC set them up nicely for round two.
This Christmas break would be perfect time for rest, recovery and rethinking strategy for round 2.
With the tournaments new super format teams get a second bite at the league title and more opportunity to become contenders, which is good news for fans and players alike.
Sri Lanka Rugby needs quality, skill and instinct among top players to shine beyond our horizon.
Rugby headquarters need to scrutinize the fundamental principles on which our system survives. I personally cannot disagree with the old principle that the governing body needs to invest and underwrite their stakeholder clubs so that we upgrade club teams to super rugby teams and give players and fans a chance to experience rugby at its highest given Sri Lankas long history.
Logically it is not an impossible task, if, the right acumen is given the opportunity for the game and country to progress beyond its Asian boundaries.
Japan will host the Rugby WC in 2019, and boast a club network of a thousand plus. Their national team is now ranked with the best. The time is ripe for us to stand up and be counted.

SoftBank alumni launches robot  companion designed to love humans
A $3,100 robot companion that exists to make people happy was unveiled on Tuesday by Japanese start-up Groove X, a tech firm founded by a SoftBank Robotics alumnus.
The Lovot was designed to enhance levels of comfort and feelings of love, according to the company, and has the ability to react to peoples moods, thanks to Groove Xs Emotional Robotics technology.
When you touch your Lovot, embrace it, even just watch it, youll find yourself relaxing, feeling better. Its a little like feeling love toward another person, the robots designers said on their website on Tuesday.
Lovot will react to your moods and do all it can to fill you with joy and re-energize you. It may not be a living creature, but Lovot will warm your heart.
Groove X said the launch of Lovot will spark an all-new relationship between robots and humans. Founder and CEO Kaname Hayashi was the development leader of SoftBanks robot Pepper before founding Groove X.
The wheeled robots are fitted with around 50 sensors and use artificial intelligence to mimic the behavior and emotions of a living being. A thermal camera allows Lovot to scan a room and immediately find its owner, while touch sensors on its body encourage the closeness between a mother and child.
Buyers will have a choice of colors when ordering their Lovot, and Groove X will also offer clothes and accessories for the three-kilogram robots.
Pre-ordering of the Lovot begins on Tuesday, with a deposit of 20,000 yen ($177.67) required to secure the purchase. The pre-order offers either a set of two Lovots for 598,000 yen, which are due to be shipped at the end of 2019, or one Lovot for shipment in early 2020 at a cost of 349,000 yen. (CNBC)

Speaker upholds MR as Opposition Leader
As the Speaker yesterday held his decision to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as final, Tamil National Alliance MPs, R.Sampanthan and M.A.Sumanthiran became vocal about it.
Sampanthan criticised Speaker Karu Jayasuriyas decision yesterday in Parliament for recognising former President, former Prime Minister and senior Parliamentarian Rajapaksa as such.
He said the Speaker had taken his decision in haste and that it was in violation of the Constitution.
Sampanthan said the Speaker has not removed him from his post as the Opposition Leader although he had announced on Tuesday the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Opposition Leader.
However, TNA leader R.Sampanthan did not take the Opposition Leaders seat in yesterdays Parliament.The Opposition Leaders seat was vacant as Mahinda Rajapaksa was not present during the sessions.
SLMC Leader Rauf Hakeen said here that Sampanthans challenge has given vent to chaos in Parliament.
TNA and SLMC members said Rajapaksa is not a member of Sri Lanka Freedom Party and added that he is a member of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, and therefore he is a stranger in Parliament, and that may be proven before a Parliamentary Select Committee.
UPFA MP Susil Premajayantha said that Rajapaksa had not resigned from the UPFA and that a Select Committee deliberation is uncalled for and unnecessary.

Staff shortage at Tangalle Hospital
There is a shortage of minor staff at the Tangalle Base Hospital, wich has slowed down functioning of the hospital, hospital sources said.
Though the hospital minor staff should be around 150, there are only 75 minor employees at the hospital, they said.
The hospital is in need of employees to work in their ambulances, because the hospital requires four workers to be employed in three ambulances, but only two workers are there, they added.
They further said that the hospital needs more nurses.

Tea prices continue to weaken
Tea prices continued to weaken further with the total Auction average declining to Rs. 536.69 from Rs. 610.28 during the corresponding period in 2017 (11%).
Exports totaled Rs. 58.7 billion compared to Rs. 63 billion in 2017, a negative of Rs. 4.3 billion (7%).
Sri Lankan tea production in 2019, consequent to the Governments decision to lift the ban on the use of glyphosate (weedicide) is likely to give much relief to the producers and in particular, to the large-scale plantations which would be able to carry-out the required agricultural practices to achieve the full potential of the plantations. Further the Governments decision last month  to allow a more liberal policy on fertiliser  should contribute favourably. Needless to say, subject to extreme weather conditions not being a reality.
However, ageing tea bushes and low productivity levels would be a downside.
Similarly, India with its aged plantations is unlikely to show any significant improvement in its output.

Teslas $7bN Shanghai plant shifts into high gear
Electric carmaker Teslas first plant outside the US, the Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai, is about to begin construction and partially start operating in the second half of 2019, one year ahead of its original plan, according to the official website of Shanghai Municipal Government, 21st Century Business Herald reports.
The gigafactory, with a total investment of 50 billion yuan ($7.25 billion), will have a production capacity of 500,000 units in two to three years.
The first phase of the factory, with an initial investment of 16 billion yuan, targets 250,000 units of Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles annually. The CKD (completely knock down) plant will enable production as soon as possible, said the report.
The plant, located in Shanghais Lingang area, remains a critical step in Teslas expansion. While China is the second-largest market of Tesla outside the US, the automaker still needs to pay a 15 percent tariffs for entering the market.
The smooth launch of the gigafactory will provide a better environment for Teslas development in China.
The Shanghai government is trying to introduce more enterprises in the industrial chain of new energy vehicles to foster an industrial cluster, and push forward Teslas localization. But industry analysts are still concerned about the companys supplier issue.
It is unrealistic to depend on US suppliers in a long run, and Tesla needs to cultivate its own suppliers in China, which is no easy task at all, said Jones Zhong, a veteran analyst of the industry, to 21st Century Business Herald.
In fact, insufficient production capacity problem has long haunted Tesla, and these problems may replay in its China journey.
Cash flow is another problem. The automaker has not realized annual profit in the past 14 years. As its expansion in the US continues, its new China plant will bring large financial pressure to the company.
Funding will mostly come from local debt, and the good news is that Tesla will enjoy preferential treatment in factory land, tax, and financing from local government.
The construction of Teslas gigafactory generated concerns in domestic auto market as well. Industry analyst Cao He said the electric vehicle market in China will face a reshuffle in the next three years, with only one or two left. Jones Zhong, on the other hand, said Teslas entrance will not shake the industry, as its position is higher than most newcomers domestically and does not belong to the same segment.
Zhang Junyi, Nio Captial co-partner, said Teslas new plant will trigger intensive competition among Chinese automakers, especially the newcomers, which will benefit the whole industry.
Tesla is very successful in the US, but it still has a long way to go in China. Traditional luxury carmakers, such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Audi will also present mature new energy vehicle models in 2021 or 2022, and Teslas achievement in China remains to be seen, Zhang added.

Threat of cyber warfare very real
Today life without the internet is something unimaginable and there is no way we can keep up with development without the use of the internet. Global computer networks provide us various communication and information exchange facilities. With the increase in internet usage for numerous data transfers and even transactions such as payments using credit cards, it is unavoidable that cyber and computer crime is also on the rise today.
Moreover, hackers have also devised means of illegally assessing other websites and private and confidential data sources in order to collect confidential information from any country. These are the reasons behind the importance of internet security today around the globe.
While internet technology is an integral part of our lives today, it is also important for every citizen or country to use the internet safely and securely without leaking private information. With this concept in mind, the Sri Lanka Army Signal Corps recently organised a Cyber Security Symposium under the theme, Cyberspace, Perpetual Battlefront for the Future.
Generally, the internet is not harmful until we choose to react to suspicious content and websites. The first reason the internet becomes harmful is when you dont know what youre doing. The second reason is when others force or entice you to react or click on links such as attractive ads, infected software, and messages.
Cyber criminals can range from professionals and big companies to even teenagers and young children. They use fake IP addresses, email accounts, and social media profiles to track people.
Three eminent speakers took the stage at this symposium to render their views on cyber security and how Sri Lanka should be geared to face the future, safeguarding personal, institutional and military information of the country.
Chairing the first session, Major General N.M. Hettiarachchi said cyber security is the days need and every person in the world is connected through his or her laptop, palmtop, iPad and mobile phone. Therefore, it is the need of the day to ensure our connectivity is secure. If we dont protect our information, there will certainly be a problem. All our services including education, transport, and health are vulnerable. We cannot avoid the incoming applications which are developed by other nations. Therefore, we must understand that all our day-to-day activities on the internet need to be protected by all means.
Readiness for cyber defence
Speaking at the first session, Dr. Sanjiva Weerawarana, an eminent IT specialist and long-time open source developer and IT advisor to the Sri Lanka Army, outlined what cyber threat means and how internet users can take precautions to avoid falling victim.
The internet is part of everything now and it is something that we cannot live without as every part of life is connected to the internet. The dependency on the network is ever constant and even with something as basic as the mobile phone, the technology provided is constantly aware of the users exact location. Beyond that, even the operator of the technology knows where the user is. They can also know the number of people gathered at any event and through phones know who is there, so they can figure out what that event is all about.
Being connected to the internet means a lot of private information is public. When certain parties can get information on a certain group that is present at a particular place, that information can sometimes be abused. Therefore, when you can capture that sort of data, a lot of analytics can be derived from that and that information can be abused for various purposes. So the connectivity of the internet, while it brings incredible benefits for humanity and is something that we cannot ever back away from, is also a threat in terms of how vulnerable you are, because the reality is that you are now part of an entire global eco system.
Dr. Weerawarana also touched on digital transformation which is used quite a lot these days, adding that it is similar to the industrial revolution that happened a few hundred years ago.
Digital transformation is the application of digital technology to every part of life. What that digital transformation does in increase dependency on technology. But digital transformation is also incredibly beneficial because it makes things which were difficult, very easy, improves productivity, and lessens the time it takes to do something. The terminology is relatively new, but with the extremely low cost of computing hardware, bandwidth, and so on, within the next 1015 years, everything will be digital, and once that happens, the dependency on digital technology will be even greater.
In fact, the countrys travel industry, banking, retail and other services are increasingly becoming dependent on the internet. Dr. Weerawarana noted that without internet accessibility, all these service sectors would come to a halt. However, he acknowledged that Sri Lanka is still way behind in comparison to developed countries, but noted that the country is fast getting there.
Cyber warfare is something very different from the usual kind of warfare we are used to. In normal warfare there are well-defined participants, but in the cyber world, none of those things exist. First of all, there is no difference between a state actor and a non-state actor. A government, a military, an organisation or an individual can be a player in the cyber warfare world.
Anybody can participate. An attack can also happen anywhere, at any time. In other types of warfare, you need to prepare and plan before you take a step forward, but this infrastructure is always in space and the ability to decide is just a matter of ones need. Size also does not matter, just one person can bring down an entire countrys infrastructure, if they know what they are doing and they have the right kind of tools available, he warned.
Military and civilian collaboration
Adding to the forum, Roshan Chandraguptha, a Cisco-certified security professional, ethical hacker, and computer hacking forensics investigator and the current principal information security engineer at CERT, said ICT is an important area for any sector. In protecting a nation, the military needs to have a reliable and accurate set of information from all over cyber space to know and predict the next move.
He said in order to assess our vulnerability, it is important to first identify the numerous cyber threats we face. Cyber criminals are those who commit cybercrimes for personal gain. Cyber espionage is also another area of concern which illegally accesses confidential or classified information. Be it the military or any other organisation, they should know how to ensure their data classification; they should know which information to protect thoroughly and which information can be public.
The other type of threat is cyber terrorism carried out by an ideologically motivated group of people around the world who would target individuals, systems, or critical infrastructure. To counter this kind of attack, one needs to understand their motives and their capabilities. Then there is cyber warfare where the next war the military would have to face would certainly be this type of warfare and not conventional warfare.
At an age when we are so dependent on cyber space, to counter the threats we need to invest in advanced technology. However, Chandraguptha said this technological advancement has to be done while maintaining a degree of human intervention. A computer can only provide programmed answers. Therefore, human intervention is vital to ensure protection.
He said practically, it will be difficult to have the technical means to monitor the entire cyber world simply because of its scale. Therefore, he said if we have a proper framework where civilians can collaborate and provide much-needed visibility into the activities of the cyber world, then greater advantage could be derived.
Meanwhile, Senior Lecturer at the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Moratuwa University, Dr. Chandana Gamage said the clear boundaries that once existed between the physical world and cyber space has now blurred or completely disappeared.
The cyber security problem has deepened due to the existence of attackers who span a wide spectrum from individual hacktivists, organised criminals, terrorists and state actors. In an era where every one of these antagonists has easy access to sophisticated cyber technology and resources, the notion of defenders having to cover all points of attacks while the attackers only have to find the weakest point in the security coverage, has become acutely relevant.
Talking about Trojans, he said while they appear to be quite useful and harmless, they are a primary source of the loss of security. The problem is compounded by the fact that while people know about all these dangers, they would still do the unthinkable. When you get emails with links that you are asked not to click on, curiosity makes a person click on it to see what happens, and this makes the user vulnerable, he said.
Dr. Gamage said when it comes to data, there is no way to figure out if someone has lost data as it is a virtual resource. Even if someone takes a full copy of your data, your copy still remains intact. That is a huge problem as once that data is stolen, identities can be stolen, money can be transferred, and so on, but you would not know that unless you have systems in place to detect and inform about data breaches, he said, adding that however, more than 80 percent of users do not have such capabilities.
He said more than 50 percent of these attacks are by Trojans. More than 400 attacks per day are being reported and unlike in the physical state, we do not hear of kidnap attempts for ransom, but in cyber space it is a daily occurrence.
Dr. Gamage said the 25th largest economy is the cybercriminal economy. Therefore, it is not meaningful for us to keep following through a failed approach of expecting the users to do the right thing and be careful.
We have to build tools that perform a white hat security approach on the systems. That means continuously looking for holes in the systems and then fixing them. To automate finding weaknesses in our systems is one of our tasks, he said.

Trump orders US troops out of Syria
President Donald Trump has ordered staff to execute the "full" and "rapid" withdrawal of US military from Syria, declaring that the US has defeated ISIS."We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency," Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. Planning for the pullout is already underway, a US defense official and an administration official told CNN.The decision, a sharp reversal from previously stated US policy, surprised foreign allies and lawmakers, sparking rebukes, rebuttals and warnings of intensified congressional oversight, even as the White House said troops are already on their way home."I'm pretty annoyed," said Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and Trump ally, who told CNN's Manu Raju the President's decision was "Obama-like" -- a reference to President Barack Obama's decision to pull troops out of Iraq in 2011, which critics say gave rise to ISIS. Graham said the role of Congress is "to make administrations explain their policy, not in a tweet, but before Congress answering questions."(Sources: CNN)

Unbeaten Kandy SC too strong for the rest
Kandy S.Cs sixth straight win in the first round of the Dialog sponsored rugby tournament was at the expense of Havelock SC who was unbeaten till then. Kandy pulled off a brilliant 31-21 victory over Havelock S.C. last weekend. Their skillful play in possession and bossing of the breakdowns helped preserve the lions share to lead 21-7 at the interval.
The pre-match predictions, were answered by three goal scored before the end of the first half. Kandy SC executed a pre-planned move in the first few minutes of the game.
Kandy should thank Buwanika Udangamuwa, for masterminding their 31-21 win. He fashioned three tries, with a chip in behind the rush defence. The winning teams defence was brilliant, they dominated the breakdown, and Havelock SCs chances all but ended.
Kandy SCs success is due to their chairman Lasantha Wijesuriya, their high quality coaching staff and a technical blueprint in place that is helping them to drive the success of the team and develop players.
Kandy continues to improve and their pre preparation for the second round is under way under the watchful eyes of coaches Sean Wijesinghe and his assistant Fazil Marija.
All round Kandy SC are too strong to defeat this season unless something spectacular happens.
The visitors enjoyed much of the possession and territory in the first 20 minutes but did little with it. Kandy on the other hand were more solid in defence and sharper in attack, with scrum half Roshan Weeraratne outstanding.
This season though the park club lost some of their players they have made good progress in a number of areas in play. A big hand should go to their coach Sanath Martis and he should thank their club president Romesh Abeywickrema and the committee members for their support.

UNF Cabinet in limbo - Pavithra
UPFA MP Pavithra Wanniarachchi told a media yesterday, though it has been seven days since the court decision, the government has not been able to find 30 ministers fit enough to be in Cabinet.
There are no ministers appointed so far, she said.
How can we expect individuals like this who are unable to reach a consensus even after seven days since the court decision, to govern a country, she asked. It is very clear that there is a crisis among the UNP and the friction between two rival groups, one which supports Sajith Premadasa and another supporting Ranil Wickremesinghe, shows that the party divided and undemocratic.
Wanniarachchi told the media that the Opposition Leader has been nominated and the Speaker has ratified it, so there should be no questions or doubts as to who the Opposition Leader is. The Speaker has no right or powers to strip a MP of their position in Parliament.The constitution is very clear about this matter. If it was not, Geetha Kumarasinghe need not to go to courts or Ranil Wickremesinghe, she added.
MP Chandima Weerakkody said new members who crossed over to the UNP went and sat next to Sajith Premadasa. This shows that they are supporting him in his bid to take over the party leadership.Very soon, Ranil Wickremesinghe would not only lose the Prime Ministers position but his own membership in the UNP.
He added that he was dismayed to see Presidents Counsel and friend M.A.Sumanthiran stand up in Parliament and make such pronounced statements.Many forget that when Chandrika Bandaranaike was the President, Ranil Wickremesinghe was the Prime Minister and Mahinda Rajapaksa sat in the Opposition.That is the parliamentary tradition.The Leader of the Opposition hails from the Opposition.
Wanniarachchi said that they were concerned that if a person from the ruling party was chosen to be the Opposition Leader since the President, Speaker, Prime Minister would then hail from the same coalition. They are allowed to nominate and make 7 out of the 9 appointments to the Constitutional Council. This is the highest council and elects members such as the IGP, head of the independent commissions and so on.
Weerakkody also noted that there was an internal crisis within the Tamil National Alliance due to some of its members not being supportive of Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Uniqueness of  RUEFULNESS
Ruefulness, by Namal Kumara will be free and open to the public from December 21 to the 27 2018 at Art Space Sri Lanka.
Namal Kumara is an emerging artist who, following his graduation in 2016 from the University of Visual and Performing Arts, has entered the local art scene with a strong following from collectors. A young artist whose medium and style sets him apart from other young artist in that his style is unique and consistent, he was selected to participate in the Imago Mundi Publication by the Benetton Foundation in 2016. His work is a part of numerous local and international contemporary collections and he continues to participate in group shows locally.
In explaining this series of work on canvas the artist states, Humanity abuses itself through ambition and ego, this causes a confusion and contradiction in the way we choose to live our lives. The play of the object against the shadow creates a unique story once combined; I have used this as my narrative. My works incorporate a human figure with open hands pointing upwards to symbolise how humans are punished by their minds. There are no shadows behind these forms, rather the shadow forms the image of the bull in motion; a symbol of the unrest and aggression. I use reds, yellows, blues, greys, purples and geometrical shapes construct this imagery and portray the ruefulness that has inspired by work.

Winning with Wit!
Sri Lankas worst ever constitutional crisis came to an end last week after a 51-day stand-off between the Executive and the Legislature that brought the countrys government to a virtual halt. The impasse was resolved after the intervention of the Judiciary, with a verdict from the Supreme Court.
The crisis was triggered when President Maithripala Sirisena, on October 26, decided to remove Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and appoint former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to the post instead. Wickremesinghes removal and Rajapaksas swearing-in took the country by utter surprise.
That there were significant differences of opinion between the President and his Prime Minister was well known. However, President Sirisenas moves to summarily sack his Prime Minister were unexpected, even though they were preceded by a series of discussions with the Joint Opposition (JO).
The Presidents decision was based on the premise that, once Rajapaksa is installed as Prime Minister, the JO together with the other factions of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) would be in a position to easily negotiate cross-overs of United National Party (UNP) parliamentarians.
Wickremesinghes dismissal
It was to allow this that President Sirisena prorogued Parliament on October 27, a day after Wickremesinghes dismissal. The prorogation, which attracted protests from the opposition, was until November 16, allowing UPFA and JO negotiators almost three weeks to negotiate with UNP MPs.
However, this is where the UPFA was caught napping. Its negotiators led by S.B. Dissanayake who mediated between the President and the Rajapaksa faction of the UPFA did not do their homework properly. They got their numbers wrong. There simply werent enough UNPers willing to cross-over.
A recorded telephone conversation between Dissanayake and UNP parliamentarian Range Bandara, where the latters cross-over was solicited also went viral on social media generating disgust and ridicule. This would have been a deterrent to any other UNPers who were considering crossing over.
The UPFA also underestimated the public backlash against the Presidents actions in dismissing Wickremesinghe, appointing Rajapaksa and proroguing Parliament.
Also facing international and local censure, President Sirisena then announced Parliaments prorogation will end on November 14.
Negotiations between the UPFA and selected opposition MPs then intensified. The objective was to secure their support for Rajapaksa as Prime Minister, so he could demonstrate he had the endorsement of at least 113 MPs in the House, a requirement under Article 42(4) of the Constitution.
As these discussions progressed, it became apparent to the UPFA leadership that they did not have the support of a majority of MPs. Faced with the prospect of Rajapaksa being rejected by Parliament if it was reconvened, President Sirisena dissolved Parliament on November 9, calling a general election.
On the next working day, Monday, November 12, twelve fundamental rights applications were filed in the Supreme Court, challenging the Presidents decision to dissolve Parliament. This was based on Article 70(1) of the Constitution which precludes dissolution before four and a half years.
Other opposition parties including the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) were steadfast in their support to the UNP in this exercise. Also filing an application was Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole, one of the members of the independent Elections Commission.
On the following day, November 13, the Supreme Court granted an interim order until December 7, staying the Presidents proclamation dissolving Parliament. It was a landmark decision and paved the way for subsequent events by allowing Parliament to continue sittings until the matter was decided.
Parliament met the next day and passed a motion of no confidence against Rajapaksa. Over the next few days, as successive votes were passed against Rajapaksa and his purported Cabinet, behaviour in Parliament descended to unprecedented depths with UPFA MPs resorting to violence and vandalism.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was prevented from taking his seat which was dragged away and had water poured on it. Chilli powder was flung at UNP MP Jayawickrema Perera. Chairs were thrown about and MP Prasanna Ranaweera assaulted a Police officer. This conduct dented the UPFAs image badly.
Other battles were being fought in court. On December 3, the Court of Appeal issued an interim order restraining Rajapaksa and his Cabinet from functioning until the hearing of a writ of quo warranto filed against them is concluded. This was another setback for the UPFAs plans to set up government.
The restraining order meant that effectively, there was no government in the country and all matters would have to be dealt with directly by the President. With the next date of hearing set for January 2019, it would have made the nation ungovernable, especially with no Budget being passed for 2019.
Supreme Court decision
In public, however, President Sirisena and Prime Minister Rajapaksa were maintaining a positive outlook. Also, some in government circles were still hopeful that the Supreme Court would hold in their favour. If they did, it would have triggered a general election and ended the crisis.
President Sirisena meanwhile continued having a series of discussions with the UPFA as well as Speaker Jayasuriya and the United National Front (UNF). However, he insisted that he would not reappoint Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister even if all 225 MPs in Parliament endorsed him.
The much-awaited Supreme Court decision was not delivered on December 7 but delayed by a few days. It came on December 13 when a seven-judge bench unanimously decided that the Presidents decision to dissolve Parliament was unconstitutional, illegal and therefore, null and void.
Although this signalled the end of the ill-fated constitutional coup for many, the Rajapaksa camp was still expectant. They were hoping that the interim restraining order granted by the Court of Appeal would be vacated by the Supreme Court. The court refused to do so on December 14.
That was the final nail in the coffin for the UPFA. On the following day, December 15, Rajapaksa resigned as Prime Minister stating he did not wish for the country to remain anarchic until January. The opposition, however, claimed that he had already foregone his post, losing support in Parliament.
Reappointed Prime Minister
On Sunday, December 16, Ranil Wickremesinghe was reappointed Prime Minister and took his oaths before President Sirisena who had to back down from his previous stance that he would never re-appoint Wickremesinghe. He was to say he did so out of respect for parliamentary traditions.
While the main political drama enacted over fifty-one days has now come to an end, the major players are reviewing recent events with an eye on the future, especially as presidential elections are due by January 2020 and general elections have to be held by August 2020 at the very latest.
While President Maithripala Sirisena has attracted much criticism for his ill-advised actions, he has attempted to explain them, stating he acted in good faith, based on legal advice provided to him by eminent counsel. Nevertheless, it is clear that the past seven weeks did not enhance his popularity.
The other big loser in this exercise was Mahinda Rajapaksa. He was riding the crest of a wave of popular support when this crisis unfolded. By accepting the Premiership and then by trying to stay in the office using strong-arm tactics in Parliament, he has lost much of the goodwill he enjoyed previously.
The big winner is the UNF and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. Weighed down by the burdens of incumbency, it was sliding in the popularity stakes. Its stance on this issue and its fight for democratic principles has boosted its morale, united its factions and enhanced its standing among voters.
Yet, there is still more than a year for the next national elections. As the past seven weeks have shown, a year can be a very long time in politics. It is now up to the UNF to deliver on its promises- or else, it too will be judged harshly by the voter- just as the UPFA was, in the past few weeks.
