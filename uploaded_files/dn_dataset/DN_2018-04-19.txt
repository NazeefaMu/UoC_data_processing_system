According to the spokesperson, the company provided Rs. 200 million to the Treasury last year. There are 40 sales agents island-wide who sell the additional production of Thriposha called Suposha.
Before paying bonuses to the employees, Minister Senaratne opened the new machinery worth Rs. 100 million installed with the aim of transferring the entire Thriposha production mechanism to machines. Earlier, 75 percent of the Thriposha production was handled with machines while the rest of the 25 percent was handled with human labour, he said.
Addressing the gathering, Minister Senaratne stated that a net profit of Rs. 2,900 million was made by the State Engineering Corporation when he was the Cabinet Minister in charge of the institution. However, the Cabinet Minister who took over after him spent the profit in six months. Now the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) makes profits and as a result, the SPC employees salaries increased by 50 percent, he said.

Top anti ageing fruits
While there is no such thing as a fountain of youth, there certainly are things that you can do to keep yourself looking youthful for as long as possible. One of those miraculous ways to stop the aging clock is to eat fruits. Certain fruits contain high antioxidant properties that can keep your skin feeling firm, clear and young.
Kiwi :
These fruits are packed with more vitamin C than an equivalent amount of orange. It is bright green, fleshy fruit speckled with tiny black seeds adds a dramatic tropical flair to any fruit salad. These fruits are creamy in consistency with an invigorating taste.
It gives a reminiscent of strawberries, melons, and bananas, yet with its own unique sweet flavor. The strong anti-oxidant compound found in this fruit firms the skin and delays the formation of fine lines and wrinkles. The higher percentage of Vitamin C and E will save skin due to damage caused by free radicals.
Apples:
A famous saying that, if you want to keep the doctor away, you should be eating these fruits daily. This fits perfectly true for the anti ageing benefits also that it offers.
One of the key components of apples is their high levels of Vitamin C. This bolsters the immune system and help keep you free from colds and other diseases as you go through life. But these fruits also have fiber, which keeps your digestive system moving. A clean digestive system plays an important role in keeping you looking and feeling good at any age.
Pomegranate:
These are one of the most popular, nutritionally rich fruits with unique flavor and taste. It has a lot of health promoting characteristics. It too has novel qualities of functional foods. They are often called as super fruits. They are just similar to sub-arctic pigmented berries and some tropical exotics such as mango. One way to understand aging is by relating it to oxidizing. Free radicals that may enter our body from dangerous or adulterated foods that we eat or from the air that we breathe oxidize our bodys molecules. We get old because we fall apart cell by cell due to continuous oxidation.
Therefore, you must consider the pomegranate as the deluxe version of the apple, capable of so much more than simply keeping the doctor away. The fruit is an also good source of antioxidant vitamin-C, provides about 17% per 100 g of the daily requirement.
Consumption of fruits rich in vitamin C helps the body to reduce the effects of free radicals. They develop resistance against infectious agents by boosting immunity.
Watermelon:
It was a big question till recent past that how could watermelon be a natural Viagra Soon it was found out that there is a key component present in it known as L-citrulline, which is an amino acid. It prepares L-arginine which is a precursor for nitric oxide, and the nitric oxide will help in blood vessel dilation. This keeps your cell alive for a longer time.
Watermelons contain potassium which is a mineral element that helps maintain your blood pressure. This regulates the heartbeat and prevents heart attacks. Watermelon also slows the accumulation of the Low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which is bad cholesterol.
Avocado:
Avocado is rich in Vitamin E and B-complex, both are wonderful in their function. This is especially when it comes to providing daily internal nourishment to your skin cells. The potassium in these fruits helps to keep it moisturized and hydrated. Glutathione contained in it assists in slowing down the aging process. The presence of oleic acid can add as an antioxidant when trying to prevent cancer. But it also has other anti ageing benefits in addition to increasing your lifespan.
Papaya:
It is a fruit you should enjoy eating if you are scared of wrinkles. It has powerful anti-wrinkling properties. It nourishes the skin with its bag full of vitamin A, C, and E.
Studies published that a diet high in carotenoid-rich foods, such as papaya, helps boost peoples defenses against the suns damaging rays. As a consequence, that helps to fight off wrinkles on your skin. The fruit has a high concentration of provitamin A carotenoid, phytonutrients. These circulate in the bloodstreams to bless you with younger looking skin. Zeatin is from the family of carotenoids which specifically deals to tighten the skin by forming good bonds in between.
Oranges:
These fruits are loaded with water, so they hydrate your skin and your cells very well. One large orange is an excellent source of vitamin C. This helps in collagen development under the skin. This, in turn, helps keep your skin look supple. Its the higher percentage of Vitamin C keeps the skin firmer. They also boost the immunity by its carotene which is the reason to provide it with its super attractive color. It helps not only in skin-cell renewal but acts as a powerful antioxidant. Antioxidants are great for getting rid of free radicals that can make your skin age faster. A good thing in favor of this fruit is that it is available in many parts of the world and at an affordable rate.
Banana:
Last but not the least here in the list, these fruits are worthy to mention, due to its good supply of potassium. The presence of manganese and anti-oxidant contents in banana prevent premature aging of cells in your body. It is also a wonderful natural moisturizer for the skin if applied topically. It also protects our cell from damaging properties of UV rays coming from the sun.

Trump OKs direct North Korea peace talks
US: President Donald Trump Tuesday confirmed direct contacts between the United States and North Korea and gave his blessing to talks aimed at formally ending the Korean War in a series of diplomatic revelations.
Raising expectations for a major breakthrough at a series of upcoming summits, Trump said a great chance to solve a world problem was within reach on the Korean peninsula.
Side-by-side with Japanese Prime Minster Shinzo Abe at Trumps Palm Beach, Florida resort, the US president said that a rare inter-Korean summit in 10 days time could, with his blessing, discuss an elusive peace treaty to formally close the 1950-53 conflict, which concluded with an armistice.
People dont realize the Korean War has not ended. Its going on right now. And they are discussing an end to the war, he said. Subject to a deal they have my blessing and they do have my blessing to discuss that.
Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have not spoken directly, the White House said, but the US president confirmed that Washington and Pyongyang had been in contact at very high levels to prepare for a historic meeting between them.
The Washington Post reported that CIA director Mike Pompeo had met Kim on a secret trip to the North over the first weekend of April, shortly after he was nominated to be Secretary of State. Both the White House and the CIA declined to comment on the report.
Five locations were being considered for the summit with Kim, Trump said.
That will be taking place probably in early June or before that assuming things go well. Its possible things wont go well and we wont have the meetings and well just continue to go on this very strong path we have taken.
Officials say that no decision has yet been made on a meeting venue, but China, North Korea, South Korea, and Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas are seen as possible locations. Panmunjom was the site of the signing of the 1953 armistice and will be the location of the April 27 summit between Kim and South Koreas President Moon Jae-in.
Officials from the two Koreas were to meet Wednesday in preparation, after Seouls culture minister -- who sat next to Kim at a K-pop concert in Pyongyang earlier this month -- said Tuesday that Seoul thinks that the inter-Korean summit should lead to the signing of a peace treaty.
The US-led United Nations command, China and North Korea are signatories to the half-century-old armistice, but most experts agree South Korea would likely have to sign any successor agreement -- which could need extensive negotiations. - AFP

The celebration, which attracted over 1500 people across the age spectrum, promoted proper dental hygiene through a series of lectures and practical drills.

Unilever Sri Lankas participation in the event is in keeping with the companys global mandate of encouraging better oral healthcare as part of its Sustainable Living plan to drive positive change in the world.
Sharing his views on the occasion, Dr. Vipula Wickramasinghe, General Secretary, Sri Lanka Dental Association said, This years World Oral Health Day was an astounding success.

Commenting on the key role played by Unilever Sri Lanka, Nilushi Jayatileke, Director Marketing - Personal Care, Unilever Sri Lanka stated, Being the pioneer that introduced fluoride toothpaste to the Sri Lankan market, Unilever is committed to its social mission of improving the health and well-being of the Sri Lankan people.
Upholding its commitment towards inculcating good oral health practices, Unilever in collaboration with Regional Dental Associations under the purview of the SLDA, have disseminated innumerable toothpaste and toothbrush samples to children across the country.

Victory through endurance
The hard work, the discipline, the achievement, the pride added to it all would be hope and anticipation to reach greater heights. Young endurance athlete, Ashwin Doranegama finds himself on the move, aiming for victory, one after the other.
Doranegama, 21, took part in the recently concluded Iron Man 70.3 in Colombo and was placed second in the 18  24 age category and thirty first out of the 850 participants. The 70.3 Iron Man consisted of a 1.9 kilometre swim, 90 kilometre cycle and a 21 kilometre run. Doranegamas finishing time for this race was 4 hours 53 minutes and 16 seconds. He was the youngest athlete in this event.
It came up as a bit of a surprise, said Doranegama. I was not expecting it, actually.
My passion for this sport started after I took part in an Ironman 70.3 contest in the Mens Open Relay category in Subic Bay Philippines in 2017, he said. At this particular contest, Doranegama contributed in the run leg and his team won the first ever Gold for Sri Lanka for the Open Mens Relay category. Just by witnessing the event, feeling the atmosphere, I got sucked into the sport, he elaborated.
In September, 2017, Doranegama entered the Olympic Distance Triathlon at the Singapore International Triathlon. Olympic Distance race consists of a 1.5 kilometre swim, 36 kilometre cycle and a 10 kilometre run. He was placed second in the 18 - 24 age category and was placed 26th out of 673 competitors.
Doranegama has been swimming since the age of four. In school, his events for nationals were the 50m, 100m, 200m, 400m and 1500m freestyle. Swimming was quite intense. We had about 11 to 12 sessions a week. Because of that, getting the discipline for this kind of training is not too hard, Doranegama explained.
In 2015, he started pursuing marathon. He did his first half marathon in 2015 and second in 2017. His first full marathon was done in 2016.
His fastest half marathon was concluded in one hour 28 minutes whereas his fastest full marathon was completed in three hours 30 minutes.
Waking up in the morning is challenging, sometimes, because youre tired after your previous session, said Doranegama. Making up your mind to get out of bed is the most difficult because youre hurting and youre tired. I think, everyday, waking up is the biggest obstacle.
Training alone is another challenge, I face sometimes, he said further. Its hours and hours, training alone. I like to train with company, so, I dont feel the time go by.
In terms of rest, you need to sleep on time, stated Doranegama. Forty per cent of the work is done by training, the rest is all what you eat how much you eat and how much you rest. Rest is like one of the most important things.
My Mom and Dad support me a lot. Dad said if youre not doing it properly, dont do it, at all. recalled Doranegama. My coach Rajan made sure I was on track, doing all the sessions, and if I didnt get something right, I had to do it the next day. Until I achieved what he wanted me to do, he made me do it for weeks. There was a time when I had to repeat the same thing for eight weeks, Doranegama remembered with wonder. It was tormenting but, I guess, thats what builds up the confidence and mind-strength. My ambition in terms of triathlon is to basically try and get more athletes of my age to start the sport by just simply showing that it can be done if you put in the time and effort, he stated.
Theres very little eagerness among people of my age for triathlon, he remarked. Outside Sri Lankan forces, its very little. Athletes are good in this sport when theyre aged 25 to 40. But its not bad to start now so you gain the experience you need for those years to come. We need more athletes doing triathlon, especially in my age.
I think people dont do this sport because theyre scared how much itll hurt. And I think you need to give in to the pain and not be scared of it, he said further.
Doranegama has been qualified to represent Sri Lanka in the (18  24) age group category at the Iron Man 70.3 World Championship in South Africa this September. The Iron Man 70.3 World Championship in South Africa is a race limited to qualified participants. Approximately 6,000 athletes from all over the world will be participating in this event and it is one of the biggest Iron Man events held in the world.
The race will be held along the coast in Nelson Mandela bay and it is said that the water is going to be cold, anticipated Doranegama. Its a wet-suit race. A lot of participants, a big audience, it will be a good experience to me.
Im excited. I can do a lot better than I did here because South Africa, for one thing, its cold, so, conditions will be better. The only problem will be with the altitudes. I might have to do a training camp for two to three weeks in Nuwara Eliya or somewhere high up to get used to the climate.
Theres a lack of facilities, remarked Doranegama. Literally, when we train, we cycle around Viharamahadevi Park. When we do our long rides, we go to places like Bandaragama, Rathnapura. Just to get out of Colombo and the traffic, you have to do a lot but if youre living in the outskirts, its fantastic. And we dont have enough experienced coaches, at all. I think, in order for the sport to grow, you have to invest in it.
Personally I want to be able to represent Sri Lanka in world championships, commonwealth and hopefully one day Olympics, stated Doranegama. I want to be able to put Sri Lanka on the map in the world of triathlon and show that we can produce athletes of such standards. I do plan on becoming a pro athlete and I hope to take the country forward in terms of the sport.
A young personality with such enthusiasm and dedication never fails to flourish the society and to take it into high levels of success and glory. It is, indeed, a pleasant hope, an unfailing inspiration.

Virat Kohli reveals what he learnt from AB
Virat Kohli, who became the leading run-getter of Indian Premier League on Tuesday, talked about how AB de Villiers inadvertently helped him in the recently concluded Test series against South Africa.
In an exclusive chat with NDTV, Kohli said, I actually learnt something from him in the recent Test series that we played. I made that adjustment to my game, which I havent told him about yet.
Kohli became the first India captain to win a bilateral series in South Africa. After losing the Test series 1-2, Kohlis team crushed South Africa to win the One-day International series 5-1 and then clinched the Twenty20 International series 2-1 to end the tour on a high.
The Indian captain also opened up on his county stint ahead of India tour of England and said, People have their personal opinions and I respect that. But I have to do what is best for my preparation going forward.
Kohli will miss the one-off Test against Afghanistan in June and focus solely on the England tour (from late June to September) where the Indian team will play a five-Test series, three T20Is and a three-match ODI series.
While it is yet to be ascertained which county Kohli will represent, it could be Surrey in all likelihood.
He will leave for England after completing his assignment for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 11th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).
Kohli went past Suresh Raina on Tuesday to become IPLs leading run-getter. Kohli needed 31 runs to catch up with Raina during the match with Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium and crossed the figure in the ninth over. He made unbeaten 92 against Mumbai but couldnt help his team go over the line and lost the match by 46 runs.
Kohlis teammate De Villiers also showered praise on the Indian team and said that they were more challenging than Australia in the Test series.  NDTV

Blue-green economic plan to fulfill SDGs - President
President Maithripala Sirisena delivering the keynote address at the Commonwealth Business Forum yesterday said the primary responsibility of implementing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) lay with the government and that he, as the Head of State was personally leading these efforts.
Speaking on Delivering the SDGs: Aligning Business, Societies and Governments, the President said: The world today is united in its efforts to create cleaner, greener and sustainable energy. There is no standard approach for implementing the SDGs, and each country decides its own path. However, the approach led by our countries should be people centred.
On the part of the Sri Lankan Government, he said they had created a special Ministry for Sustainable Development, integrating the SDGs to the overall national policies and the government had launched a Blue-Green economic plan which would ensure the full utilisation of the ocean and other natural resources of Sri Lanka in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner.
Through this economic strategy Sri Lanka hopes to become a role model for addressing the best practices, the President said.
In 2015, the world came together and agreed upon a common vision for a sustainable future in adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in order to create a world that is socially just, prosperous and sustainable.
The Plan of Action we agreed upon is inspiring. Therefore it is very important we give life to this ambitious development plan all the way through its successful implementation, urged the President further.
In order to eradicate poverty, to address climate change and to build peaceful inclusive societies, it is agreed that the key stakeholders must come together.
These include not only the governments but also the business and civil societies and communities, he added.
Good business practices would be a catalyst for peace and good governance. It should reflect social responsibilities and uphold rule of law with zero tolerance on corruption. Such practices will enable inclusive growth and common prosperity, said the President further, also taking the opportunity to encourage public-private partnerships to deliver much needed infrastructure in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals.
Real alignment of business society and government will depend on these stakeholders aiming to achieve cohesive social responsibility for the best satisfaction of the people.

The actor, who played the character in 2004 film 'Catwoman', was massively criticised for her performance. She famously accepted a Razzie for Best Actress in 2005 and in her speech she called the film "god-awful movie".
According to a report, 'Black Panther', fronted by Chadwick Boseman, has renewed Berry's hopes and she said she deserves another opportunity as the Catwoman.
"Each story builds on the next. It's like that old saying goes: behind every 'Black Panther' is a great black 'Catwoman'! You know, I've gotten a really bad rap for this role, and I think Catwoman deserves another goddamn chance, don't you" she said.

Istanbul Meets Sri Lanka workshop felicitates Lankan tour operators
A workshop was held in Istanbul organized by the Turkish Airlines Sri Lanka office in collaboration with the Turkish Airlines Cargo Sales office recently, where Sri Lankan tour operators were felicitated and rewarded at a ceremony held at the Renaissance Istanbul Polat Bosphorus Hotel.
Welcoming the tour operators and travel partners, Tuncay Eminoglu, Turkish Airlines Vice-President, Sales for Asia, Far East Regions and Australia, said Turkish Airlines flies to more counties than any other airline in the world and Sri Lanka was one of them where the first flight was launched in 2013. He said at that time they had only 4 weekday flights to Colombo and after considering the demand and success, the frequency had now increased to daily flights with modern A330 Airbus aircraft.
Turkish Airlines which started its journey in 1933 with only five aircraft today has 326 aircraft with one of the youngest fleets in the world and they were proud to reach their destination number 302 which include 253 international and 49 domestic and covering a record number of 129 countries, Eminoglu said.
Sri Lanka Ambassador to Turkey P M Amza addressing the meeting said the topic of the gathering of the day which was Colombo Meets Istanbul was broader one in his view because it did not talk about one segment of the people like the Colombo government meeting the Turkish government nor it talked about Colombo institutes meeting Turkish institutes.
What is significant is that it talks about the people to people contact, the people of Sri Lanka liking to meet the people of Turkey.
The ambassador said during the Ottoman rule in Turkey a consulate was establish in Sri Lanka in view of expanding trade between the two countries. Trade between the two counties had such an ancient history that even it had gone beyond the Ottoman rule. Amza however emphasized that the understanding between Lankan and Turkish people about two countries now were not that great.
The Lankan Ambassador to Turkey said the awareness between the two countries must be increased and one problem that he had noticed was that all propaganda material about Sri Lanka was available only in English. This promotional material should be available in the Turkish language, he said.
The ambassador said to overcome and address that situation with the assistance of a honorary consul he had compiled a booklet in the Turkish language highlighting the places that Turkish tourists would prefer to visit in Sri Lanka. While emphasizing that the daily Turkish airlines flights to Sri Lanka should be used to further promote tourism between the two countries ambassador Amza urged Sri Lankan travel agents to use the opportunity fulfill that objective.
Turkish Ambassador to Sri Lanka Tunca zcuhadar speaking at the event said the Turkish Sri Lanka relationship goes back many years.
In 1864 the Ottoman Empire established their first consular relations between the two countries. The reason why the Ottomans opened an honorary Consulate in Galle was to help the traders and also assist the pilgrims.
He also recalled that Turkey was one of the first countries that recognized Sri Lanka after its independence and the Turkish residential embassy in Sri Lanka was opened in 2012 and in Turkey in 2013 with Turkish Airlines direct flights from Istanbul to Colombo also commencing the same year. The direct flight of Turkish Airlines is a great impetus for our close relations, he said.
Recalling that Sri Lanka in Arabic is called Sarandip which means pleasant surprise, the Turkish Ambassador said he has been in Sri Lanka during the past two and a half years and the country is full of present suprises. Thats why I highly recommend my fellow Turkish Travel Agents representing the workshop to promote Sri Lanka. On the other hand I request my Sri Lankan friends to promote Turkey, zcuhadar urged.
Several Sri Lankan travel agents were awarded at the event which concluded with Biz to Biz meetings between the Sri Lankan and Turkish counterparts.

Sl committed  to preventing  financial crime
Sri Lanka has long identified the risk of financial crime as a priority area, given the countrys history in battling a sophisticated terror organization. A number of measures were taken over the years and the government is currently working on bringing on necessary amendments to some of the existing regulations with the objective of preventing financial crimes.
Minister of Finance and Media Mangala Samaraweera made these remarks at a roundtable discussion on Financial Regulation: Working Together to Address De-Risking, held on the sidelines of the 2018 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), at the Mansion House in London, on Tuesday.
The Minister stated that the sophistication of financial crimes has increased exponentially in recent years and is a threat to all nations which has resulted in a number of negative fallouts for international finance.
One such negative fall-out is de-risking, the scenario of global banks selectively withdrawing from the business of correspondent banking.
This can have highly detrimental implications for banks in developing countries in particular as it can shut them out of the global financial architecture, the Minister added.
Minister Samaraweera also stated that the challenge for countries like Sri Lanka is how to ensure continued progress of financial inclusion in this context.
At a more micro-level, one of the major objectives of our government, embodied in the 2018 Budget themed Enterprise Sri Lanka, is to empower entrepreneurs by providing access to finance.
In order to ensure access to finance at grass roots level, it is important for the Sri Lankan financial system to have robust access and engagement with the global financial architecture, Samaraweera said.

As such, the development plan still remains at the planning stage, the citizens of Ambalantota said. Under the development plan, the following projects were to be implemented which included setting up of a bus stand, a play ground, renovation of Ridiyagama Wadurupa road and Beragama road, the renovation of the circular road in close proximity to the clock tower in the heart of the town.
The roads in the heart of the town are narrow and as such the vehicular traffic is greatly obstructed. The Ambalantota is a main commercial city but the town remains congested.

The paddy farmers in the district have already begun tilling the land.
Usually in the Yala season 120,000 acres are cultivated. Due to the insufficiency of rainfall, the entire extent of paddy lands in the district cannot be cultivated.
In the Akkaraipattu irrigation region, about 3,849 acres of paddy lands will be included for cultivation.
Mayooran said that water for irrigation will be given from Ilukkuchenai and Neethai minor tanks.

Because You are a Girl...
It felt strange to be reading Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie during the new year break. The rituals performed on new years day clearly defines the roles of men and women in our society  women light the hearth at the auspicious time and confine themselves to household chores in the year just begun  men plant trees and engage in monetary transactions  the new year traditions must be a nightmare for feminists. I wonder what Adichie who wrote a 63-page blueprint for feminists called Dear Ijeawele, or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions, would have said if she was in Sri Lanka this time last week.
Quite a lot, no doubt. Legend has it not long ago, Adichie stood in front of a small class of literature students at Cardozo high school in Washington, D.C. While introducing her, Dr. Frazier OLeary, the classs soft-spoken teacher, mentioned that Adichie had visited the school a few years before, and that between that visit and this one, Adichie had had a daughter, now two years old. Then he ceded the floor to Adichie. She stood before the 20-odd students, her fingertips on the podium, and swept her almond eyes around the room.
So, what should we talk about she asked speaking with great precision, measuring every word. The first question came from a young man, originally from Ghana, who very politely asked how Adichie was balancing her work with the responsibilities of motherhood. She took her time to answer, and then, with her chin lowered, she raised her eyes to look kindly at the student. Im going to answer your question, she said, but you have to promise me that the next time you meet a new father, you ask him how hes balancing his work and the responsibilities of fatherhood.
Adichie believes feminism is a project that necessarily binds mothers and daughters, and that raising a daughter feminist has as much to do with what you tell yourself as what you tell her. In her book We should all be Feminists, Adichie writes, The first time I taught a writing class in graduate school, I was worried. Not about the teaching material, because I was well prepared and I was teaching what I enjoyed. Instead I was worried about what to wear. I wanted to be taken seriously. I knew that because I was female, I would automatically have to prove my worth. And I was worried that if I looked too feminine, I would not be taken seriously. I really wanted to wear my shiny lip gloss and my girly skirt, but I decided not to. I wore a very serious, very manly, and very ugly suit.
The sad truth of the matter is that when it comes to appearance, we start off with men as the standard, as the norm. Many of us think that the less feminine a woman appears, the more likely she is to be taken seriously. A man going to a business meeting doesnt wonder about being taken seriously based on what he is wearingbut a woman does.
I wish I had not worn that ugly suit that day. Had I then the confidence I have now to be myself, my students would have benefited even more from my teaching. Because I would have been more comfortable and more fully and truly myself.
Since then, she has chosen to no longer be apologetic for her femininity. She has decided she wants to be respected for her femaleness. She says she now often wears clothes that men dont like or dont understand.
I wear them because I like them and because I feel good in them. The male gaze, as a shaper of my lifes choices, is largely incidental.
Adichies set of guidelines for how to raise a feminist daughter includes teaching your daughter to question language. She advises never to call your daughter princess. The word is loaded with assumptions, of a girls delicacy, of the prince who will come to save her. She prefers angel and star instead. Decide the things you will not say to your child, says Adichie. You know that Igbo joke, used to tease girls who are being childish  What are you doing Dont you know you are old enough to find a husband I used to say that often. But now I choose not to. I say, You are old enough to find a job. Because I do not believe that marriage is something we should teach young girls to aspire to. Her mantra is because you are a girl is never a reason for anything.
Adichie who now divides her time between Nigeria and the US, grew up in an upper-middle-class home, the fifth of six children. Her father was a professor at the University of Nigeria, her mother was the universitys registrar  the first woman to hold that post. Her parents expected Adichie to be a doctor, and for a year she studied medicine at university, but her heart wasnt in it.
When I said I wanted to write, they were very supportive, which was very unusual, she said. Nobody just leaves medical schoo , especially given its fiercely competitive to get in. But I had a sister who was a doctor, another who was a pharmacist, a brother who was an engineer. So my parents already had sensible children who would be able to make an actual living, and I think they felt comfortable sacrificing their one strange child.
Adichie was just 26 when she published her first novel, Purple Hibiscus, in 2003. It won the Commonwealth Writers Prize for Best First Book. Her second, 2006s Half of a Yellow Sun, was a shimmering work of historical fiction that reminded the world of the Biafran War and made it deeply personal; it won the Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction (now called the Baileys Womens Prize for Fiction) and garnered comparisons to one of her heroes, Chinua Achebe. The next year, she won a MacArthur grant and found time to finish a masters degree in African studies at Yale.
The Thing Around Your Neck, her first collection of stories, was published in 2009, followed by 2013s Americanah, an intimate and accessible story about family and immigration set in Nigeria and New Jersey. It won the National Book Critics Circle Award and has become an enduring best seller.
In Americanah, Adichie describes how she found her authentic cultural voice - and warns that if we hear only a single story about another person or country, we risk a critical misunderstanding.
Yet, unlike the majority of her previous work which had been tightly controlled and gravely serious, in Americanah she is loose and irreverent. I decided with that book that I was going to have fun, and if nobody read it, that would be fine, she says. I was free of the burden of research necessary for the other books. I was no longer the dutiful daughter of literature.
Adichies unforgettable quotes
1.It is easy to romanticize poverty, to see poor people as inherently lacking agency and will. It is easy to strip them of human dignity, to reduce them to
objects of pity.
2. Marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support but why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we dont teach boys the same We raise girls to see each other ascompetitors not for jobs or accomplishments,which I think can be a good thing, but for theattention of men. We teach girls that theycannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are.
3. Of course I am not worried about intimidating men.The type of man who will be intimidated by me isexactly the type of man I have no interest in.
4. The problem with gender is that it prescribes how we should be rather than recognizing how we are. Imagine how much happier we would be, how much freer to be our true individual selves,if we didnt have the weight of gender expectations.
5. Show a people as one thing, only one thing,over and over again, and that is what they become.

CEB Union to launch work to rule
The Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union (CEBEU) has decided to work to rule from May 8 in protest of what they see as the states failure to ensure an uninterrupted power supply in the country.
Addressing a media briefing at the Organization of Professional Associations (OPA) in Colombo yesterday, CEBEU President Saumya Kumarawadu explained that the cost of the generation of electricity has been on the rise since 2015, resulting in the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) continuing to face heavy losses.
Last year, the CEB incurred a loss of Rs. 45 billion and this year they expected it to exceed Rs. 50 billion. The generation cost in 2015 had stood at Rs 15.06/kwh with the addition of the Norochcholai Power Plant (300MW) to the grid at the end of 2014. Since then, however, no new source of energy has been added to the grid, and coupled with the prevailing drought and the need to resort to more diesel power plants, the cost had risen to Rs 21.32/kwh by 2017.
Electricity prices are simply going to rise in the future. We see no sign of it reducing, said Kumarawadu, adding that the state enterprise CEB would continue to face losses until a low cost power plant was added to the grid.
The Unions actions also come in the wake of them not being able to resolve issues with the utility regulator, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) which has refused to approve in total its 20 year Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP), with approval being given only for the next five years. The PUCSL has insisted that the CEB remove coal from its energy mix and opt for LNG instead. The regulator has forwarded their own LCLTGEP for the CEB to follow.
Kumarawadu noted that the PUCSL was only a regulatory body with the responsibility of ensuring that their plan was in line with the government policy and thus they had no power or expertise to draw up their own plans.
We have discussed this several times and we had proposed a generation mix of LNG, coal, hydro, wind, solar, etc. But the PUCSL asks that we build all future thermal plants with just LNG. This will be a major risk to the energy security of the country.
They also alleged that the PUCSL was approving 400MW and 500MW LNG plants brought forward by private Japanese and Indian investors in the guise of government to government projects when they rejected the CEBs own 300MW proposal stating that it was too large for the system.
The PUCSL is merely catering to private interests, he added.
The Union has in the last two years met President Sirisena twice and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe thrice to explain but neither had offered them a solution to the energy crisis at hand, said the Union.
They demand that approval be granted to the CEBs LCLTGEP 2018-2038 plan, immediate action be taken to allocate lands to build low cost power plants, devise a proper mechanism to provide a government subsidy to CEB for incurring losses as a result of no new power plants being built and amend the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No 20 of 2009 appropriately to remove the unnecessary impediments for the proper functioning of the CEB. Other unions within the CEB have also agreed to support the strike action.
The failure to add new power plants to the grid, be it coal or LNG will result in the CEB not being able to meet the demands for power in the country.

From crisis to sustenance  Part 23
Challenge  the process  and be successful
Lets get right to it - history is useful for many things, but the experience and wisdom acquired from days gone by should be a springboard to the future, not an excuse for living in the past. Smart leaders simply dont waste precious resources on refining initiatives  they invest in reimagination efforts. Leaders would be well served to apply reimagination to all aspects of their business, but particularly with regard to constantly reimagining how they lead.
Leaders venture out and are not afraid to challenge the status quo. They step into the unknown, looking for opportunities to grow, innovate and inspire. All the stories collected by Kouzes & Posner involved leaders facing a challenge  and no one claimed a personal best by keeping things the same.
Leaders who challenge the process are willing to challenge the system to get new products, processes, services and systems adopted  even if there is a risk of failure. And if they do fail, they learn quickly from their actions.
Anything in business can be improved, everything can be reimagined, and many things can flat out be eliminated. The trick is knowing what items to focus on. While the following list is clearly not exhaustive, it identifies 9 things all leaders should challenge:

1. Challenge the Foundation - Bad things happen when your foundation is shaky. If the core values, vision, and strategy arent sound and aligned, everything else will suffer. If you dont have a clearly articulated direction and purpose, how can you expect to achieve the right outcomes The best leaders stand for something bigger than themselves, and theyre driven by more than just profit motive. They understand the value of a purpose driven business. If what Ive just said doesnt make any sense, its time to start the reimagination process.

2. Challenge the destination - Leadership isnt destination based  its a continuum. Great leaders think beyond the outcome. They think about what if and whats next. They dont get trapped in the journey to a specific destination but remain in constant search of discovery in order to seek new and better opportunities.

3. Challenge the promise - Is your brand promise on target Is it deliverable Is it sustainable If you cannot keep your promise to customers, you wont have much of a business to worry about. Few things hinder the advance of a business like a brand in need of a refresh.

4. Challenge the model - Not all business models are created equal. Furthermore, just because you have a business model doesnt mean its the right one, or that its sustainable. Break the business model down from the revenue engine all the way down to the distribution model and delivery strategy. Does it afford you a competitive advantage moving forward, or does it need to be reimagined

5. Challenge the information  Not all inputs are created equal. Dont think big data  think good data. Smart leaders understand theres a difference between gut instincts, data, information and knowledge. Furthermore, as much as some dont want to hear this, opinion and theory arent always synonymous with fact and reality. Agendas and bias often pervade the information flow, so trust and credibility must factor in when assessing information quality.
Always challenge the information but recognize theres a difference between being a skeptic and being discerning. Lastly, its always worth reimagining how you process information to yield better decisions.

6. Challenge the organization - Ive been around long enough to see almost every type of organizational design come and go, only to come again. A great example of this would be Matrix organizations, or what I call the corporate version of the Matrix Trilogy. The Matrix model has been around for nearly 30 years.
While many organizations have killed the Matrix, some have readopted it, others have remained trapped in the Matrix for decades, but virtually every large enterprise using it is over-matrixed. I can think of no better target for reimagination than the Matrix. Wheres Neo when you need him For those of you not trapped in the Matrix, youre not off the hook. Any organizational structure can be reimagined and improved.

7. Challenge the culture - Every organization has a culture. Some are carefully created and curated by design, and others evolve by default. Some are toxic; some are barely surviving on life support, while others are healthy and vibrant. The bottom line is culture can be a significant asset or a tremendous liability. The thing about cultural dynamics is they can change very rapidly  either in your favor or against it. Leaders who fail to constantly challenge cultural norms and constructs are failing themselves and those they lead.

8. Challenge the talent - Many things benefit from compromise, but talent is not one of them. If you settle for anything less than acquiring, deploying, developing, and retaining the best talent possible, shame on you.
Ive often said, leaders deserve the teams they build. If you cannot seamlessly mobilize and deploy the best talent to your greatest opportunities or your biggest risks you have a problem.
If succession isnt an enterprise wide concern there is trouble on the horizon. If leadership development is just a buzzword and not a point of emphasis you wont remain competitive.
The areas of leadership development, organizational development, and talent acquisition should constantly be challenged and reimagined.
9. Challenge the complex - Dont fall into the trap of believing sophistication is synonymous with complexity  its not.
Great leaders challenge all things complex, and if theyre smart, they look to simplify everything. Whether its strategy, organization, process, or execution, if its complex it needs to be reimagined.

Leaders have to search for opportunities by seeking innovative ways to change, grow, and improve. Each leader has to ask himself, How do I go to work today and do something that will move the enterprise and myself another step in the right direction Although there has never been a time when a company could rest on its laurels and survive, it is even truer today that if you are holding your own, everyone else will be passing you by.
To search for opportunities, leaders must use the four essentials:
1. Seize the initiative
To be effective on the battlefield, or the boardroom you must gain and maintain the initiative. It is essential to make your competition react to you, not you to them. Once initiative is lost, all control of the situation goes to your opponent.
2. Make challenge meaningful
This ties right back into Inspire a Shared Vision. When people understand why they are doing things, they buy into it and are much more motivated to accomplish their objectives.
3. Innovate and create
Routine work drives out non-routine work and smothers to death all creative planning, all fundamental change in any institution.
4. Look outward for fresh ideas
We need to leave behind the Not Invented Here (NIH) attitude.
There are all kinds of sources of information and knowledge that we have not yet tapped into. Continually question the status quo and look to see how others are handling their challenges. Experiment and take risks by constantly generating small wins and learning from mistakes.
Behaviors that derail the Challenge
Challenge the Process is more easily preached than practiced, often resulting in a strong feeling of hypocrisy about leaders. On numerous occasions, people have told me, My boss says she wants us to be creative, challenge the status quo, and think outside the box. But when we question why certain work must be done the way it is being suggested, we hear something akin to, If you have a problem with it, no one is forcing you to work here!
How would you translate that message It can certainly come across as controlling, duplicitous, and quite disabling to creative efforts. It is usually much easier for you to challenge something you believe needs improving, than to have others challenge something you believe does not.
There will always be operations in an organization that are untouchable at the moment. But, you will lose your credibility as a leader if you declare yourself immune to change or your favorite things off limits to the scrutiny of others.
Sometimes, the practice is communicated as challenge only the little things. There are organizations that seem to allow people to dabble, tweak, fine-tune, or slightly improve, but any change that might be considered too big is off limits. There is nothing at all wrong with continuous improvement. It just does not require the same degree of leadership that more ambitious opportunities call for.
Inherent in this practice is the need to experiment and take risks. Challenge the Process is never completely safe. Remember, if there is no chance of failure, there would be no risk taking, only sure thing taking. Leaders must continue to work at creating an environment which promotes the taking of a few chances.
Challenging the process is not something else that people need to do, on their own time. It is the only way to keep up with change occurring every dayfrom competitors, technology, economic conditions or whatever. If change is not done by you, it will be done to you, and leaders know on which side of that statement they most want to be.

## Title: Chinas first quarter growth beats expectations at 6.8%
## Supertitle:

Chinas first quarter growth beats expectations at 6.8%
Chinas economy grew at an annual pace of 6.8% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, according to official data, beating forecasts for the period.
The growth figures for January to March were also above Beijings 2018 annual growth target of around 6.5%.
The data shows resilience in the worlds second largest economy, helped by strong consumer demand.
But concerns about Chinas economy - including rising debt levels - remain.
The government has been fighting to contain ballooning debt and a housing bubble without hurting growth. Amy Zhuang, China economist at Nordea Bank in Singapore described the first quarter growth figures as solid but also said there are signs that the positive momentum is weakening, likely due to the cooling housing market.
The growth figures come amid concerns about Chinas outlook for exports which has been clouded by rising tensions with the US, its largest trading partner.
Against this backdrop, Bo Zhuang, China economist at the research firm TS Lombard told the BBC that exports growth is the top growth risk in 2018.
And while Mr Zhuang said stock markets have already priced in significant risks of a trade war, his firm believes it is feasible and likely that a deal can be negotiated.
As such, Chinese growth data through 2018 will be closely watched for any impact of tariffs proposed by the US.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Research firm TS Lombard believes exports growth is the top risk for Chinas economy in 2018.
The first quarter GDP numbers are good figures, reflecting what appears to be a healthy economy in China, which continues to grow, albeit at a slowly decelerating rate.
But the prospect of a trade war with the US could stifle that.
Strong retail sales growth of 10.1% suggests seasonal bounces are being ironed out and that the governments push to boost domestic demand is on track.
Online retail sales growth continues to be vast; it was up just over 35%. At the current rate, this sector in China doubles in size every two to three years.
But it was also exports that helped the economy grow in line with the second half of last year.
A resurgent global economy is very good news for China. But remember its trying to wean itself off a reliance on exports leading the charge. This could be a particularly acute problem if the trade stand-off with the US escalates.
The caveat, as always with these numbers, is that Chinas GDP figures are pretty much unrivalled in their ability to match government targets and remain at a staggeringly consistent level.
Many China watchers advise caution with Chinas official GDP numbers.
Julian Evans-Prtichard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said the official figures need to be taken with a grain of salt as they have been implausibly stable in recent years.
While we dont think Chinas economy is expanding as rapidly as the official figures claim, there is broader evidence to suggest that a recovery in industry did prevent growth from slipping too much last quarter. (BBC)

Citi-CCC Rural Economic Empowerment Program facilitates loans to rural entrepreneurs
Citi-CCC Rural Economic Empowerment Programme was initiated in June 2015 with the financial assistance of Citi Foundation with the main objective of empowering rural entrepreneurs through financial inclusion by providing training on financial literacy and business management skills as well as providing micro financing through facilitating linkages with banks.
The second phase of the Citi-CCC Rural Economic Empowerment Programme commenced in March, 2017 has been working with over 400 rural entrepreneurs from 11 Divisional Secretariat (DS) Divisions in Anuradhapura and Galle Districts. These include five DS Divisions in Galle Districts namely; Niyagama, Nagoda, Velivitiya-divithura, Neluwa and Thawalama and six DS Divisions in Anuradhapura District namely; Nochchiyagama, Nachchaduwa, Galnewa, Eastern Nuwaragampalatha, Thalawa and Mihintale.
The project activities of the second phase commenced in the above selected DS Divisions with an awareness session about the project and assistance offered through the project so that they have a clear understanding on the project interventions and dispel any false expectations from the project. Project staff of the Chamber, HNB staff including the Regional Manager for the respective region, Branch Manager and Micro Finance Officer of the respective branch, CEO of the District Chambers and Senior Officials of the respective Divisional Secretariats participated in these awareness sessions.
HNB officers explained the details of loan schemes available for micro and small scale entrepreneurs as well as the loan application and evaluation process.
HNB officers also highlighted the wide experience, they have gained in working with micro and small entrepreneurs through their Gemipubuduwa programme and their capability to extend loan facilities to all creditworthy entrepreneurs with viable business ideas/plans within the shortest possible time. Officers of Divisional Secretariats stressed the importance of empowering rural entrepreneurs through programmes of this nature led by the private sector. Whilst extending their fullest co-operation for successful implementation of the project, they requested the beneficiaries to make best use of the services/assistance offered by the project to improve their businesses.
During the awareness session, baseline information on the beneficiaries businesses, issues faced by them and the type of assistance required were obtained through a simple questionnaire in order to assess current status of their businesses/livelihoods and to plan project activities to suit their needs. The project conducted awareness sessions in 11 DS Divisions mentioned above with the participation of over 600 beneficiaries.
Baseline survey revealed that a large percentage of the participants are already engaged in some livelihood or a business venture and most of them have expressed interest in obtaining business management training, marketing assistance, advisory services to solve some technical problems, technical training and financial assistance.
The project partners strongly believed that proper understanding of basic business management principles and planning the business in a methodical manner is of paramount importance for success of their businesses. Therefore, the project offered basic business management training for selected beneficiaries through 3 structured training programs based on Foundation to Improve Your Business module of ILO accredited SIYB Training Program. The resource person for the training programs was a Master Trainer of ILO-SIYB Program, National Facilitator of ILO  Know about Your Business module and an experienced Business Development Expert and the 3 training programs covered following subject areas. The training programs were conducted using the participatory training methodology where the resource person facilitated the learning process through close interactions with the participants so that they can easily understand the subject areas covered by each training program.
Citi-CCC Rural Economic Empowerment Programme linked the beneficiaries who successfully completed the FIB training module and developed a basic business plan with the respective branches of HNB. After careful assessment of creditworthiness of beneficiaries and the feasibility of their business plans, HNB facilitated loans to beneficiaries linked by the programme.
In addition to offering small number of loans by each branch in the respective area, HNB provided loans to around 30 beneficiaries from Nochchiyagama, Nachchaduwa and Galnewa DS Divisions on September 22, 2017. On April 4, 2018, HNB through its Pitigala Branch facilitated loans to 70 beneficiaries of the programme from Neluwa and Thawalama DS Divisions. Altogether, the Citi-CCC Rural Empowerment Programme has so far facilitated loans to over 100 rural entrepreneurs during the last one year period.
Shanaka Waduge, Head of Corporate Affairs of Citi Bank, Sri Lanka, Jude Fernando, Deputy General Manager, SME and Development Finance of HNB, Visvanath Gunawardena, Senior Manager, Development Banking of HNB, Jagath Dissanayake, Regional Manager, Development Banking of Southern Regions of HNB and Chandrarathna D. Vithanage, Senior Assistant Secretary General of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce graced this occasion.
Representatives of all partner organizations including Citi Bank, HNB and CCC highlighted the importance of empowering and providing necessary guidance and assistance to rural entrepreneurs, who plays a catalytic role in uplifting the rural economy making a significant contribution to national economic development.

Pray for peace in Syria
Iran has helped Sri Lanka in difficult times. We are grateful to Iran for the support given to us during our difficult times.
Sri Lankans are always happy to help other countries.
There had been an armed conflict in Syria for the last several years. Sometimes back Syria was a peaceful country. At that time they were stable economically and politically.
We, Sri Lankans, are very keen to see Syria coming back to normal. The civil war has killed more than 220,000 Syrians. This is very tragic. As Sri Lankans, we are much worried about this situation. We want all the powerful countries in the world to do something and bring peace to Syria. We hope Iran, Russia, USA, UK and France will do their best to make Syria again a peaceful country.
Population of Syria is 18.43 million. Population of Sri Lanka is 21.2 million.
Area-wise Syria is 185,180 square kilometres. Sri Lanka is only 65,610 square kilometre.
Syrian civil war is an ongoing armed conflict. It is a conflict between forces of the Baath government forces and forces who want to remove this government. Protestors in Syria demand the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
According to the UN estimates, 220,000 people have been killed.
Syria is a country in western Asia bordering the Mediterranean Sea, Turkey, Jordan, and Israel.
Russia is supporting the Assad government. USA, UK and France are against Assad.
As Sri Lankans, we want peace in Syria at any cost. We must support any country in the world trying to establish peace in Syria.

Commonwealth cauldron of fire and world class skill
Sri Lankas trip to sunny Australia and the Commonwealth Games had all the makings of a gladiator weekend...with tons of hope for our tuskers against Fiji, Wales and Uganda.
Could there be step up performance from our young brigade What are the chances of some surprised spectator interest to get our performance off the ground
Our basics, on how to deal with Olympic champion Fiji, stand up to Wales and grab Uganda with our young speed merchants free to express themselves..
Burning questions that demand answering.
The boys stuttered with Fiji and were outgunned by Hong Kong 7s champions without much counter.....a win that sapped our energy and affected the next opportunity.
Wales were setting up and ran well for their 53 points.
Much anticipation for some heartwarming rugby skills from our islanders against Uganda....
But the reality was a real baptism of fire and hard graft for Muthutanthri, Danushka Ranjan, Soori and Co to get amongst the tries.
Here was that chance to define our rankings and grab some reputation.
Our islanders rugby future has always been in 7s and setting out that hugely needed professional structure with central contracts and the whole 7 yards
Fundamental to all Sri 7s and the massive input so far...is natural skill, pace and relentless stamina that defies logic and science.
I am hesitant on all 3 counts, knowing the quality of the squad ...same story with our levels of experience.
The massive search for real pace that gives Fiji, England, NZ, and South Africa...will be our Sri quest for fire ....and we live in great hope that day dawns soon.
What scintillating joy to nurture and blood a Carlin Isles and a Perry Baker for Sri ...or a Cecil Africa....
What magical joy for us Sri islanders to run out ...skill bubbling away and eager adrenaline to break defence at will....for support and blistering pace, anyway you dream it.
In all honesty...we accept our current status as a matter in progress...and wish president Seneviratne, chief executive Ekanayake, Director Gunaratne ...and the team at Sri Lanka Rugby...the sharpest learning so far plus plenty of young raw pace to boost our reserve.
Hope the investment falls on fertile plans that net talent from all corners of our resplendent island.
The Commonwealth Games ...a stark indication of our total lack of forward planning as a nation...with purpose and necessary investment in human talent.
We need to wise up and dedicate our resources for that singular ambition....the government of the people ...should support them to succeed.
The passion for sport an ideal means to win hearts and stride boldly into the new millennium.
Challenge the world and rewrite history ...is a wonderful poster for New Sri and the way beyond our horizons.
Time for the rugby family to accept our current state and unite for a defined formidable future ...with all the negative thinking cast out to drift upon our oceans.
Sri rugby is starring down the barrel of upgrading to world class...and 7s is our balance for that remarkable future.
Look no further than Kenya and the intoxicating talent they have produced in the last 5 years.
Take the case of those American Eagles, then absorb the skills of Portugal and Spain on the world circuit.
The time to support Sri islanders 7s is now ...the future is stronger, faster, more skilled and full time pro players that inspire the globe.
Bula bula Sri Api!

Converting to greener cities
The world, in unison, is speaking of saving the environment. What is the role sustainable or green architecture plays in it Archworld speaks to famous architect Murad Ismail for his viewpoint on the matter.
"In the past, there was no real issue about understanding the degradation of environment. The dwellings were smaller and their occupants accommodated to secure themselves from the environment. For instance, Sri Lankan architecture encouraged smaller windows and thicker walls to deal with the heat. But it didnt really matter because it was not mass scale production, said Ismail.
But over the years, with industrialization, the buildings became bigger and increased in number. Population increased and large scale land clearance took place. Then only was the environmental thought process was really researched into. So, the green building concept came up in favour of saving energy and correct use of material, he elaborated.
So, at present, the carbon footprint is taken into consideration in architecture which is developed upon the minimal effect it has on the environment. Its not that we can totally eradicate but we are trying to minimize the adverse effect, he said.
With the damaging effects, we believe we have the ice-caps melting, the ozone layer damaged and the temperature increased, I think there is a transformation in the world, Ismail remarked. With the industrialization and development, the amount of CO2 released into the environment has increased and were trying not to add to it. Were trying to reduce what buildings, material manufacture or sustainability is going to negatively impact the environment. We will need the buildings, we will need the cities but were trying not to contribute too much to the disaster.
In the early days, when we were not worried too much about energy and technologically advanced material, we had very standardized material around the world so we used them to the best of our ability. It had all to do with how you keep the house warm in a cold climate, how to keep it cool in a warm climate and control light and ventilation, explained Ismail. So, since the old days, architecture evolved on the usage of what we had in hand at that particular moment. Architecture evolved for the usage of mankind and as a necessity for use.
Today, with the development and increase of population towards cities and the scarcity of land in cities, larger and more complicated buildings have evolved. Therefore, environmentally, one has to think of energy and material used. Today, were expanding as a necessity, but at the same time, were trying to minimize the use of energy  energy in form of electricity, of production of material, or of sustaining a material, he said further.
There are 3 clear areas of being environmentally conscious:
Energy
Material such as e-glass, blocks heat and Ultra Violet rays but you can see through it without a problem. Technology has gone further where we have solar panels  solar energy and automation systems where the usage is controlled. Theres a lot of technology that takes place which allows us to minimize energy wastage, stated Ismail.
We have alternate energy  how you design with material that is helped to save energy. And how to manipulate the design itself to save energy, he said.
Sustainability
The idea for me in environment friendly material choice is how much energy is used to produce a material and how much energy that material can give you within a period of time, said Ismail. Basically, if the energy put into making the material and sustaining it is more than what it can give you in terms of durability, then, I dont think its environmentally friendly. For instance some eco-friendly hotels and resorts, using biodegradable material such as timber is made to last a prolonged period of time, theres a lot of energy put in to sustain it, he explained. Re-polishing, replacing while a lot of human energy and chemicals are used.
Sometimes, replacing could be worth it, he stated. But put the timber in the wrong place, you have to keep looking after it. Its like, you cannot take a soup in a paper bag, he elaborated. Youre not going to build a high-riser with sticks and stones and expect it to last a hundred years. Therefore, choice of material is really important.
Direct green/ Chlorophyll count
There is a clear notion of the demolition of chlorophyll  trees, grass, the greenery  which is a breathing center, said Ismail. How we actually reproduce what we have demolished in order to build something is important.
The idea is that, if you take a green plot of land to build a high-riser, we need to find a way to replace that amount or more on the building so the quantum of green is not disturbed by a city, he explained.
This has now been used in East Asia (e.g. in Thailand), where they replace whatever ground they have taken up for the edifice the amount of chlorophyll which produces oxygen within the day  on the building, itself.
This can be done by creating vertical gardens, or planting on rooftop. We need greenery for many reasons. It is the breathing ground, the oxygen production. It is where fauna inhabits in flora and it produces food. And secondarily, it collects dust. We need that, he stated.
In Sri Lanka, weve been really environment friendly since long years, remarked Ismail. Our architecture has been simple  minimal use of material, sustainability minimal  because we were a poor nation. We have not destroyed our beaches. We have been using a lot of natural, reproduced material, for a long time, he added.
But now were changing and going into cityscapes. And most environmental friendly buildings around the world talk about energy saving, automatizing of buildings and the material use.
If the material is brought from another part of the world, the amount of energy required for transportation and all other calculations must be taken into account. We, like other countries need to be careful how and where we get our material. We have to weigh the pros and cons. The best way to look at this is Environmental Economics.
When its unhealthy for the environment but necessary for the economy, we, today, can turn to the new subject around the world: Environmental Economics where you weigh the pros and cons and use the best solution to balance both needs.
It is important to learn green architecture and the correct way to practice the art. Reach beneath the outer layers and you will find a deeper foundation upon which it is built. There you can learn, realize and practice and protect the scarred nature, saving it for many generations to come.

Cuba nominates Castro replacement Miguel Daz-Canel

Cuba's parliament has picked Ral Castro's right-hand man, Miguel Daz-Canel, as the sole candidate to succeed him, ending the family's long rule.
Castro took over as president from his ailing brother Fidel in 2006.
An improvement in relations with the US which began under Barack Obama has been partially reversed since Donald Trump entered the White House.
Castro is expected to remain a powerful influence in the communist state even after he steps down.
The National Assembly has voted on the nomination but the result will not be announced until Thursday when he is expected to formally pass the presidency to Daz-Canel.
However, he will stay on as head of the Communist Party until its next congress in 2021.
The next Cuban leader will inherit a country in economic stagnation and with a young population impatient for change.
There is also the complex task of leading without the same revolutionary past embodied by Ral andFidel, who died in retirement aged 90 in November 2016.
Who is Daz-Canel
He may have had a relatively low profile when he was first appointed the vice-president of Cuba's Council of State in 2013 but he has since become Castro's key ally.
For the past five years, he has been groomed for the presidency and the handover of power. But even before being named first vice-president, the 57-year-old had already had a long political career.
He was born in April 1960, little over a year after Fidel Castro was first sworn in as prime minister.
He studied electrical engineering and began his political career in his early 20s as a member of the Young Communist League in Santa Clara.
While teaching engineering at the local university, he worked his way up the ranks of the Young Communist League, becoming its second secretary at the age of 33.
Ral Castro has praised his "ideological firmness".

Point of view 
Equity markets ended the week firmly, gaining ~29 points week-on-week, despite hitting 11-week low on Monday since Mid-January.
Although activity levels remained largely dull in the holiday shortened week due to traditional New Year, the benchmark Index hit a 4-week high of 6,483.91 gaining ~29 points (~0.44% W-o-W) while the S&P 20 index hit a 4-week high of 3,676.98 gaining ~20 points (~0.55% W-o-W).
The average weekly turnover declined by ~49% Week-on-Week to 0.5Bn, lowest since December holidays.
Local Institutional and HNI participation accounted for ~65% (of total market turnover) during the week, higher than the average of ~49% so far in 2018 while Softlogic Finance, Ceylinco Insurance & JKH accounted for largest proportion of crossings (~75%).
Market sentiment had improved after no-faith motion against the Prime minister was defeated 46 votes and the policy rates were eased by 25bps, as the ASPI improved ~40 points (~0.61%), while the S&P 20 index improved 37 points (~1.01%) since 4th April.
Foreign investors recorded a net foreign outflow of Rs.0.5Bn cf. a net foreign inflow of Rs.1.7Bn (highest since 1st week of Jan-18) last week.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from the cabinet reshuffle expected to happen before the Traditional New Year, and the activity levels are expected to recover as investors return to markets post the New Year holidays.
Global markets unsettled by geopolitical developments and US protectionism concerns
Reflecting both the heightened sense of domestic political instability and changes in global risk appetite, net foreign inflows to the bourse have begun to indicate a declining trend over Q118. Indeed, even excluding the one-off sale in Mar18 when ORIX Corporation of Japan sold its 29.97% stake in LOLC Plc to LOLC Holdings for Rs.12.8Bn, net inflows to the CSE display a declining trend.
February remained a challenging month for global financial markets, with most asset classes recording losses for the 1st time in months: Global equities lost money for the 1st time since Oct16 while worldwide bond markets were on track for its worst monthly performance since Nov16.
For the 1st time since Nov16, global investors appeared to reject EM/FM assets as net foreign portfolio flows to emerging markets fell $4.5Bn in February, ending a 14-month streak of net inflows.
Although the broad sell off in these EM/FM assets eased somewhat over Mar18, global financial market volatility remained high amid rising concerns over global trade wars following the USs tariffs on Metal imports, the worsening diplomatic tension between Britain and Russia and ongoing turmoil within the US political landscape.
Reflecting these broader global themes and also the heightened sense of political instability domestically, net foreign flows to Sri Lankan Equity and Debt markets reversed their positions for the 1st time in months.
Net foreign holdings of G-Secs in Mar18 fell 3.2% to total Rs320Bn cf. Rs.330Bn in Jan. Meanwhile, net foreign inflows to equities which recorded a 3-year high in 2017 eased to Rs. 7.2Bn (excl. LOLC sale) by end-Q118 as net inflows in Mar fell to Rs.1.2Bn from Rs.2.0Bn in Feb18 and Rs. 4.0Bn in Jan18.

A failed experiment
The new electoral system has deservedly drawn heavy flak from all political parties across the political divide. Even the pohottuwa which won a near landslide at the February 10 LG polls has started griping after some of the local councils won by it has had the tables turned. None other than President Maithripala Sirisena, during one of his regular meetings with editors and heads of media organisations, the other day, was critical of the new electoral system, particularly the monstrous increase in the number of local councillors (over 7,000) whose maintenance would place a heavy financial burden on the state, and called for an urgent revision of the system.
The latest to add his voice against the new electoral system is Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan in the wake of at least three local councils won by the TNA in the north being usurped by other parties through resort to subterfuge. He too has called for change in the system where justice will be done to the parties who won a majority.
Perhaps the worst to suffer has been the UNP which lost the coveted Galle Municipal Council, which it wrested control after a long period, after the SLFP lent its support to the pohottuwa, prompting Minister Vajira Abeywardena to call for a re-look at the new electoral system. The same was witnessed at Negombo where the UNP which won by a majority of over 6,000 votes was unseated by the same combination which prompted the UNPs Mayor in waiting (until then) Royce Fernando to cry foul and declare that black money was at work.
Decidedly, the new electoral system was put in place without giving thought to its ultimate outcome. True, any experiment is bound to run into snags. But those responsible ought to have paid careful attention to all the nitty gritty, particularly as the matter concerns the franchise of the people. The end result has been utter chaos, with most of the local councils in an unworkable state.
If the new electoral system was intended to check acrimony and bloodletting during electioneering, in addition to halt the practice of money bags being thrown liberally, in the battle for the manapey it has signally failed to do so. On the contrary, it has gone onto exacerbate the situation, with unforeseen developments cropping up. Previously, if there was violence during the election campaigns, now this has shifted to within the walls of the councils. Television showed how violent fisticuffs broke out during the inaugural sessions of some of the hung councils. At the inaugural meeting of the Wattala Pradeshiya Sabha, won by the pohottuwa, there was a right royal free for all with damage caused windows and furniture of the building, necessitating police intervention.
It was the contention of the Joint Opposition that the chief reason for the non disposal of garbage and the rise in dengue was the delay in holding the LG elections by the government. However today the situation has even further deteriorated with garbage piles lying unattended, what with the ongoing clashes among councillors whose attention is only focused on retaining the power they won in the councils with the support of other parties.
As already mentioned, the new electoral system has not brought about the desired effect where vote buying is concerned. If this happened under the PR system it was in relation to bribing the voters. However now we have a situation where big money is passing hands between the elected councillors of different parties in order that one particular party secures the majority. Hence all the good intentions made to cleanse the electoral system and rid it of the sleaze prevalent under the PR system has come to naught.
On the other hand the new system has caused chaos and confusion. It is difficult for a person of average intelligence to fathom on what basis the seats are allocated vis-a-vis votes received, with the compulsory quota of womens representation adding to the confusion. For instance, in the Dehiwela Mt. Lavinia Municipal Council, while the UNP won by a majority of 1,000 votes the seat allocation was equal (19) for the Greens and the pohottuwa with the mayoralty eventually going to the pohottuwa via some jiggery pokery. In Negombo even though the UNP won by over 6,000 votes, there was only a single seat difference in the allocation of placements in favour of the UNP which, needless to say, left ample room for manipulation. For the first time in the local government history in this country the public was treated to a comedy of sorts where the mayor or chairman of an MC or PS was decided by drawing lots under the supervision of the District Secretary. If that was not enough, violence broke out within the premises of the councils between rivals no sooner the victor was named, a development that is unprecedented.
Hence it is plain that the system is anomalous and needs overhauling. The President should take prompt action in this respect. The system should be done with before the next elections. The experiment has failed.

President tells Sri Lankans in London:
Fake news on social media hampering country's good name, development
President Maithripala Sirisena addressing the Sri Lankans living in the United Kingdom said that attempts taken to bury the truth and to spread fake news are a hindrance to the development and success of the country.
The President also invited the Sri Lankan community living in London to assist the journey of building the country with a proper understanding of the real situation in the country.
He made these remarks addressing a meeting held with the Sri Lankan community living in London, on Tuesday (17). President Sirisena is attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London.
He said that even though Sri Lankans living in other countries receive all the information about the country, he said that he doubts whether all information they receive are true and correct.
The President further explained that the real information on the propaganda followed by the government to develop the country by establishing freedom and democracy are not delivered to the people effectively.
I met many groups of Sri Lankans living in the UK. One thing that I realised after having discussions with them was that they receive a lot of fake news and information. I understood the amount of false propaganda that is being fed to you on social media and 75 percent of the information is false, he said.
President Sirisena pointed out that during the recent communal unrest in Kandy, more than the truth, rumours spread fast and added that the measures taken by the government to control the situation were hardly reported.
You might be talking to your relatives every day. But I see that fake news is being spread rapidly to the Sri Lankan communities living abroad. And they are not aware of the measures taken by the government for the well-being of the people, he said.
The President said that new technology and social media were introduced to ensure continuity of a healthy society but it is being misused by people not only in Sri Lanka but in the whole world.
He said that even United States of America faces issues related to spread of false information on social media.
Following the Digana incidents, I ordered a State of Emergency, army was deployed and social media was blocked and the government took immediate measures to bring the situation under control. Some of the Ambassadors had a problem with the decisions we made and they exceeded their limits and criticized our actions. We were not afraid, we took every necessary action that was needed and as a nation we were able to prevent a great calamity, he said.
President Sirisena further said that an organisation affiliated to the United Nations commended Sri Lanka for blocking social media during the crisis and another organisation said that if Myanmar had done the same when the first incident occurred, it could have prevented the calamities that followed there.
All the international organisations appreciated the measures taken by the government.People wrote to me and appreciated what I did and some parents even requested to ban all social media if possible, he said.The President said that political issues are common in every country and cannot just limit it to Sri Lanka.
I heard people complaining about the prevailing political issues in the government. Political turmoil is common in every country from Britain to Japan.Every country has its own political and economic issues, he said.
The President said that as a responsible government they have taken all the necessary initiatives to ensure co-existence among the communities, to build peace and to ensure non recurrence of war.
He said that there are many positive consequences as a result of the measures taken by the government in the past three years and added that those results do not reach the people effectively.
The resident said that some print and electronic media misuse democratic rights and spread false news and further stated that they have not truly understood the value of the freedom given to everybody by the present government.
In 2015 and 2016, our focus was to strengthen our international relations. Now, all the countries treat Sri Lanka as their friends. Europe, USA, UK, India, Russia, Japan and middle-east countries are friends with us. Sri Lanka never maintained a very well relationship with all the countries as now, after the independence, he said.
He said that the government made economic plans in order to develop and strengthen the countrys economy.

Fifteen percent import duty on gold
A 15% import duty on gold based on value was imposed by the Finance Ministry with effect from yesterday.
According to Finance Ministry sources, the decision to impose such a duty comes in the wake of a suspicion on gold smuggling. There is a suspicion that gold which is imported to Sri Lanka at a concessionary tax rate is being smuggled to other countries.
According to sources, around 8,000 kilogrammes of gold had been imported to Sri Lanka in 2017 and in 2016 respectively.
This is a tremendous inflow of gold in to the country,sources pointed out.
However, the value of jewellery made and sold from that gold does not tally with the amount of gold brought into the country under concessionary taxes.Hence, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has authorised an investigation into the matter, sources said.
Sources said that the recent detection of Rs.170 million worth gold biscuits is suspected to be a part of the same gold smuggling racket.

Review:
Framed flashes of life
Rendezvous in Colour at Alliance Franaise de Colombo
Where you feel passion, you are driven to strive and create. With burning enthusiasm, these artists splashed colour on their canvases, always reassured by the guidance of a trusted teacher.
Driven by their passion for art, many beginners have turned to Veteran artist Royden O. Gibbs throughout the years, for his tutelage. The final works of one such group of artists were displayed recently at exhibition Rendezvous in Colour.
The creations of the diverse group of 12 students were displayed at the Alliance Franaise de Ceylon, popularly known as Alliance Franaise de Colombo. The artists were, namely, Lal Chandranath, Veeranthi Wijemanne, Keshani De Silva, Renuka Mendis, Hansaja Devnith, Malinka Samarasinha, Dharsha Samarasinha, Wasantha K. Siriwardena, Manel Ratnayake, Dianthi Uragoda, Gamini Fernando and Lilani de Silva.
The exhibition spoke to its curious audience through a number of impressive paintings from water colour still life to portraits of persons, from urban scenes to enthralling flashes of nature.
Green scenes of nature
Dianthi Uragodas sceneries drew in the viewers attention in an unfailing grip. While standing in the quietness, contemplating her work, one would feel enveloped in the green forest view. Her work Serenity captured light pouring through the green into a stream of water and each ray of that light had been made to look radiant. If you lingered long enough, you would feel the coolness pouring through the scenery. Her painting Cascading Water pulled in the viewer with equal strength, making one imagine the sound the gushing body of water, while Morning Glory enveloped you completely in the cool shades of green.
Seascape in Galle by Wasantha Siriwardena revealed a calm sea of emerald green. The atmosphere of the painting captured the viewer instantly. The colors were maneuvered neatly to create gentle waves and the picture was a framed scrap of nature to remember.
Above Seascape in Galle hung Light House  Beruwela by the same artist as if to remind us that every adventurer who sets sail out in the ocean eventually seeks the welcoming light of land.
Portrayal of wild animals
Uragoda had captured the adoring mischief in the eye of a young leopard in her painting Leopard Cub. The feeling of adoration evoked by the painting was felt in contrast with the danger and subtle fear, felt when standing across the room, in front of Siriwardenas Leopard. The latter showed a full grown beast with lurking danger, powerfully portrayed in its eyes. Leopard was done with pen and ink and the monochrome background surrounded the animal, creating an image of night time.
The same unafraid, daring sense was captured by Hansaja Devnith in his painting of two wild elephants. The fearlessness of the eyes of one elephant looked at the viewer through the painting and they spoke of unmistakable danger that hides in the wild. Gamini Fernandos Tiger in Rantharbhore similarly captured a tiger with scrutinizing eyes. The softness of its hair was portrayed skillfully.
The painters had succeeded in portraying emotion in the faces of their subjects. A close observer would notice that even wild animals could communicate through their features.
From ancient ruins to urban scenes
Ancient ruins and the quietness that surrounds them were skillfully portrayed in Devniths Veherakanda  Kotte and Keshani de Silvas Beyond Serenity. The unmistakable pink and red flush of drooping young leaves of ironwood (na) trees portrayed in the latter revealed the skill of the painter.
Taking the viewer into more structured, urban scenes were Urban Conviviality by de Silva and Slave Island by Siriwardena. The exhibition was gracefully adorned with these brief flashes of views from everyday life, looking into the scrutiny of the viewer.
Veeranthi Wijemannes Tranquility and de Silvas A Bright, Breezy Day showed sun-stained paths that stretched among big trees.
The open spaces between the portrayed objects conveyed the quietness of the scenes, though, if you were curious enough to step into the sunny day in your minds eye, you would observe the sound of the breeze, rustling through the soft trees. The colours were maneuvered deftly to make the sunshine look natural. The method of painting realistic light was prominent in these works, too.
Delicate painting
Lilani de Silvas paintings, titled From the Garden Fence, A Drop of Nectar and Hidden in Shells showed a graceful beauty that was soft and gentle. The flowers, the feathers and the delicate egg-shells it all, very quietly, spoke of how gentle her brush strokes were, and her careful choice of colours.
More works of art
Manel Ratnayakas View from Kadugannawa showed impressive scenery and it was evident how the painter succeeded in placing the viewer at a high point, looking into the vast greenery below.
Lal Chandranath had portrayed Disappearing Brick Kilns of Kaluaggala and The Parson House in Canada (built 1886-1888), each painting capturing the rural surroundings of the two countries excellently. The chosen colours green and brown prominent among them blended nicely into the rest of the watercolour-washed art of the exhibition.
Among other chosen media were also oils, pastels and lead pencil. Uragodas Portrait of Amma was done completely in lead pencil and was remarkable among a number of similar works.
The collection was, overall, impressive. It was clear that Gibbs students did not fail to do justice to the media with which they chose to create their works of art.

## Title: Glyphosate ban: Has GMOA studied the research

Worlds largest study shows no harmful effects :
Glyphosate ban: Has GMOA studied the research
At a press conference held on April 11, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) stated that fresh laws should be introduced to take stern action against people involved in smuggling in such harmful chemicals like glyphosate. The GMOA considers glyphosate to be harmful because it allegedly causes cancer and kidney disease. However, just last November, the world's largest study on the health effects of glyphosate covering over two decades and involving 90,000 people, found NO harmful effects even on applying powerful statistical analysis to scrutinise the data.
Published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (JNCI) on November 9, 2017, the long-term large-numbers study found that there was NO association between glyphosate, the main ingredient in Monsantos popular herbicide RoundUp and any type of cancer. In particular, there was no association with any solid tumors or lymphoid malignancies overall, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma and its subtypes.
The new study used long-term data collected through the Agricultural Health Study. The study carefully monitored the health of nearly 90,000 people in Iowa and North Carolina from 1993 to 2010. These included farmers licensed to apply pesticides to their crops, and their spouses. The impact of more than 54,000 pesticide applications is taken into account in the study of which 83 percent contained glyphosate. Many of the farmers had been using glyphosate even before the study. Yet, after some two decades of continuous and intense use of glyphosate herbicides, they found NO significant increase in cancers among those exposed to the chemical.
Most scientists acknowledged the quality, clarity and decisiveness of the study, funded entirely with government and university sources. David Spiegelhalter, a Cambridge University professor who was himself not involved in the study, confirmed (according to a Reuter report) that the analysis has been large and careful and shows no significant relationship between glyphosate use and cancer.
So, how did the GMOA miss this decisive, massive study which in fact looks at the type of diseases that the GMOA thinks is caused by glyphosate Even though we can excuse Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera and his acolytes to be out of touch with the scientific community, one would expect that the GMOA would have its committee of mavens when it comes to technical matters, even though we recognise that the GMOA is a trade union with the primary mandate of protecting its own turf.
Lack of scientific evidence
The most important non-communicable disease that the GMOA refers to is cancer. This is precisely what is now definitively excluded from any association with the use of glyphosate, even if the latter were used continuously and intensely for two decades by a farmer. Perhaps the GMOA also has in mind the form of chronic kidney disease of unknown origin (CKDu) that is prevalent mainly in the Rajarata. There is no scientific evidence at all in support of this, while there is compelling evidence against the claim. In Sri Lanka, a small but politically powerful group of individuals led by Ven. Ratana Thera, and a small number of scientists on the fringe of the main scientific community have claimed that chronic kidney disease is caused by the glyphosate in the environment and the food chain, and that too only if arsenic, hard water and other agents are found in conjunction with glyphosate.
But the cats, dogs, cattle, and many villagers in the Rajarata itself, where the residents drink water from agricultural channels, rivers and lakes, do NOT get CKDu, while those who drink water from their private wells, located away from the paddy fields, get CKDu. So there is a strong anti-correlation between agrochemical use and CKDu. We also know that countries like Malaysia and New Zealand, which use many dozens of times more agrochemicals than Sri Lanka have no such chronic diseases.
Furthermore, the 90,000 people monitored by the US-NCI study would have also alerted the researchers to any higher incidence of kidney disease, since many different health indices of these subjects were a part of the inputs to the database. While the presence of correlations does not establish a causal connection, the LACK of any correlation is a very strong indication that glyphosate cannot be a causative factor in diseases that the GMOA has indicated.
Vested interests
This US-NCI study is just one of the many studies that have come to this conclusion. Over 190 countries of the world are satisfied and approve the use of glyphosate. However, strong political movements that take a nostalgic, romantic and often anti-science approach to agriculture have become very powerful during recent decades.
Their strength is the unreasoned fear of the public, fanned by the MANTHRA that chemicals in the food cause all sorts of chronic diseases. These groups join hands with the commercial interests of large consumer chains that offer organic foods, natural foods, holistic foods, etc., catering to the elite classes who also control the politics of most countries, constituting about 1 percent of the world population. It is not surprising that many educated people and indeed medical doctors who do the daily grind but do not follow the research, fall for the chemicals are poisoning our food MANTHRA. In fact, many agrochemicals, if applied in sufficiently high doses can be toxic, as with ALL pharmaceuticals and industrial substances like gasoline, chlorine, or common detergents. Even spices like chillies and cloves are potent toxins when their familiar-use thresholds are exceeded.
The conclusion of the International Agency for Research in Cancer (IARC) in 2015 that glyphosate is a Class-II hazard causing cancer at high doses was a God-send to the no-chemicals-in-my-food (NCMF) lobby. The Class-II hazard was weaponised for propaganda and renamed a dangerous TOXIN although no health risk was implied by the IARC. The NCMF lobby joined the powerful activists engaged against Frankenfood. This was their name for foods cropped from genetically modified organisms (GMO). Wheat, soya, canola oil, rice and vegetables where specific genes in their DNA have been replaced by other genes confer them economically or medically desirable properties. Genetic engineering of crops is the modern version of plant breeding where trial-and-error approaches are replaced by a modern approach guided by the DNA of the crops of interest. A key role in GMO cropping has been given to glyphosate in that it is economically advantageous to use GMO crops resistant to glyphosate to allow weed control. Sri Lankans have been safely eating GMwheat flour from USA, and Canadian lentils, for decades.
The opponents of GMO have directed their guns on glyphosate as a part of their campaign against so-called Frankenfoods. Every manner of propaganda trick has been used. One of the most farcical is the Kangaroo court organised by a French journalist, Marie-Monique Robin, in the Hague, Netherlands. This propaganda event, patented and owned by Robin is named by her The International Court of Justice, Hague to deceive the public by associating with similar-sounding institutions linked to the United Nations (see: http://dh-web.org/green/NatuNewsFake.html).
This court pronounced in April 2017 that Monsanto has committed crimes against humanity in unleashing glyphosate which is a weapon of mass destruction! Ven. Rathana Thera and Dr. Jayasumana were the main Sri Lankan delegates to the Kangaroo court. The delegation claimed that 3 out of every 100 families in the Rajarata gave birth to deformed children due to glyphosate use. However, 3 percent is the expected average birth statistic for deformed children, irrespective of glyphosate use, even in the days before glypohsate, be it in glyphobic Norway, Sri Lanka or glyphilic North America. Ven. Ratana Thera repeated the same false claim of 3 percent birth defects in the Rajarata being due to glyphosate on Derana on March27, 2018.
On the same broadcast, Ven. Rathana Thera stated that the GMOA is with him. Does the GMOA stand with the statistics of Ven. Rathana Thera Has the GMOA taken cognizance of the world's largest study on glyphosate covering some 90,000 people exposed to glyphosate for some two decades, continuously As a responsible, professional body, we hope that the GMOA acts on the basis of evidence and rejects the false claims of misguided zealots.

Grievance of an old couple abandoned by their son

Their daughter had died at the age of 35 while their only one son has abandoned them.
Under this prevailing situation, earlier they had lived in a thatched house. After that, those who trained under him in masonry, have constructed a house for this couple. Now, they are getting Samurdhi and the public assistance to eke out their day to day sustenance.
Although, Sirisena is unable to carry out his own work because of his blindness, he is moving here and there for his domestic activities with the support of a string made by coir. He walks to the latrine with the support of this string. As a result, they have to suffer many difficulties. In this connection, Sirisena Basunnehe said, my daughter died while my son left us after he got married. Currently, we are all alone. I am completely blind. We are living from hand to mouth on Samurdhi and other public assistance. The young-men who trained under me in masonry had constructed a house for me. Now, we are living there.

Hair hues!
Playing around with the colour of your hair is one way to make a statement. However you need to know the trendy colours of the season and which of those would suit you because hair colour can change ones overall appearance dramatically.
Choosing the right hair colour
Choosing a hair colour isnt as easy as simply picking out a colour you like. There are a lot of factors to contemplate before picking a colour for your hair. To decide on the right hair colour for you, plan out your new look, consider your complexion, and take other factors, such as your age, into consideration.
Different ways of colouring hair
There are many different styles and types of hair colouring. Some of the basic forms of colouring are global colour, root colour, highlights, lowlights and nombre.
The effect of hair colouron your skin tone
The perfect hair colour will not only complement your skin tone and make your best facial features pop, it can also help you look years younger. Get it wrong and you could end up looking washed out, tired, unnatural and older!
Prepare ones hair for colouring
If your hair is damaged, a regular protein treatment for a few weeks prior to your hair appointment can help replace the strength in your hair. Damaged hair should also be trimmed a couple of weeks before your colour appointment to get rid of the split ends.
Hair colouring process
Hair colour was traditionally applied to the hair as one overall colour. The modern trend is to use several colours to produce streaks or gradations, not all work on top of a single base color. These are referred to as highlighting, where sections of hair are treated with lighteners, and they usually create blonde streaks.
Lowlighting are sections of hair are treated with darker hair color. There are also newer application techniques such as ombr, in which hair is dark on the crown and bit by bit becomes lighter toward the ends.
Lowlights vs highlights
Lowlights involve darkening strands of hair by using colours that are darker than your natural colour. In contrast, highlights use colours that are lighter than your natural shade.
Stop missing spots when colouring hair
It is always best to go to a professional to get your hair coloured so that the issue of having missing spots can be avoided.
Permanent colour applied over a semi-permanent colour
It is possible to apply permanent colour over a semi-permanent colour however a semi permanent colour cannot be used to lighten a darker permanent hair colour.
Protective pre-colour treatment
You have to remember that colour processing does damage your hair, and that the damage done is cumulative. Protective pre-color treatments do help to minimize the damage colouring does to the hair, but should never be used to justify colouring the hair excessively.
Colouring ones eyebrows to match ones hair colour
It is possible to colour ones eyebrows to match ones hair colour and can be done using and eyebrow dye.
Colour filler
Protein fillers help equalize the porosity of the hair and gets into the gaps of the cuticle so that the hair colour penetrates evenly.
Permanent thicken hair
Permanent colour does actually thicken your hair by expanding the cuticle layer to deposit colour into the shaft, or disperse the existing pigments. Many women and men who have fine hair like the change in texture created by the hair colour process.
The effects of medications on hair colour
Healthy hair holds on to colour best. Some medications and other drugs may affect hairs receptivity to dyes. The most common culprits could be thyroid medications, chemotherapy, and some types of hormonal medications.
Using hair colour mixed the day before
It is not possible to use hair colour mixed the day before as the hair colour would have oxidized in the bowl and lost its strength.
Semi-permanent hair colour and hair damage
As temporary colours dont contain bleach, they cant lighten your natural shade. Temporary dyes fade with shampooing and exposure to air. This means they need to be frequently reapplied, which can be damaging. However, permanent dyes can be more damaging to your hair. Compiled by Ruwini Jayawardana

Hambantota brackish water fish culture still in its infancy stage
As the brackish water fish culture is still in its infancy stage, the entrepreneurs with foresight must think of Hambantota as a potential base to invest in it, a senior fisher folk of Hambantota said.
He said that there is a fair extent of shallow salt water lagoons, estuaries, deep lagoons and tidal mud flats in Hambantota alone. He said that an estimated 6,000 hectares are considered potentially suitable for coastal aqua culture.
The fresh water fish fauna includes around fifty indigenous species and several introduced exotic species such as Chinese carp silver, Big head carp and Tilapia.
The senior folk further says that the consumer response had been a very positive factor that will be most encouraging to those interested in fresh water fish farming.
Meanwhile, under the present regime, top priority is given to aqua culture development. The major areas of development are inland fisheries, fresh water aqua culture and coastal aqua culture, the senior fisher folk said.
Hambantota has four fishing harbours at Tangalle, Hambantiota, Kirinda and Kudawella. Most facilities have been upgraded at these harbours by the previous and the present regimes providing opportunities for the investors.
The Tangalle Regional Fisheries Training Center established in 1973 plays a key role in fishery
development. Courses conducted at the center include Marine engine technical course, Fishing gear technology and Mobile training extension.
Yet another area for investment is the utility of refrigerated and insulated trucks. The fish need transportation from the production area to consumption areas, the senior fisher folk in the district said.

Indian economy to  grow 7.3% - World Bank
Washington: The World Bank today forecast a growth rate of 7.3 per cent for India this year and 7.5 per cent for 2019 and 2020, and noted that the country's economy has recovered from the effects of demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax.
"Growth is expected to accelerate from 6.7 in 2017 to 7.3 per cent in 2018 and to subsequently stabilise supported by a sustained recovery in private investment and private consumption," the World Bank said in its twice-a-year South Asia Economic Focus.
In its report the World Bank said, India should strive to accelerate investments and exports to take advantage of the recovery in global growth.
"Every month, the work force increases by 1.3 million people and India must create 8.1 million jobs a year to maintain its employment rate, which has been declining based on employment data analysed from 2005 to 2015, largely due to women leaving the job market," the bank said.
In the India section of the report, the bank acknowledged that disruptions from demonetisation and events surrounding the implementation of GST led to a setback in economic activity and a potentially larger negative effect on the poor and vulnerable. Looking ahead, return to business as usual and subsequent rebalancing of growth drivers towards investment could support acceleration of GDP growth to 7.4 per cent by FY 2019, it said.
As in the past, sustained growth is expected to translate to continued poverty reduction, albeit with heightened uncertainty because of the effects on the informal economy, it said. Noting that the one-time policy events disruptions from demonetisation and uncertainty surrounding GST slowed India's economic momentum in FY2016, the IMF said real GDP growth slowed to 7.1 per cent in FY2016, from 8 per cent in FY15/16, and further to 5.7 per cent in Q1 FY2017.

Large-scale water tapping along Apura feeding canals
The activities of water pirates, who tap water flowing along the feeding canals to Huruluwewa, Thisawewa, Nachchaduwa, have become a serious problem.
The Anuradhapura Government Agent told the Daily News that farmer organizations and other officials had received complaints in this regard.
The inhabitants of the Huruluwewa scheme have also complained to the Anuradhapura Government Agent and the District Agricultural Committee that water coming through the Huruluwewa feeding canal to fill the tank is unnecessarily blocked at Habarana, Hiriwadunna and Thalkote by the agrarian development authorities without a proper water management system.
As such, Huruluwewa receives a limited water quantity from Mahaweli River for cultivation activities, the farmers pointed out.
The feeding canal carrying water from the Mahaweli water sources up to Huruluwewa is 60 km in length.
It is learnt that some, engaged in tourism and large-scale agricultural work, are illegally tapping the feeding canal which creates a scarcity of irrigational water at the Huruluwewa end.
The Huruluwewa irrigation engineer said although the Mahaweli water management committee releases 10,000 a.f. annually to Huruluwewa, not even one-fourth of the water reach Huruluwewa.
He said he had requested the district agriculture committee and the Anuradhapura Government Agent to get the Habarana, Hiriwadunna and Thalkote tanks transferred from the administration of the Agrarian Development Department to the Irrigation Department.
It is learnt that the water flowing along Yoda Ela from the Kalawewa tank to Thisawewa is also being illegally tapped along 20 km distance around Thalawa and Batuwatta.
The same situation is experienced with regard to the Nachchaduwa tank, where some groups of farmers had damaged the padlocks and bolts of the sluice gates of Heen Ela and Maha Ela of the Nachchaduwa reservoir to obtain water illegally.
Hidogama Police are investigating these incidents.

Law Commission tells Govt.
Make BCCI an answerable Public Body
NEW DELHI, Wednesday: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) should be brought under the ambit of the RTI Act, the Law Commission said today noting that it falls under the definition of a public authority which has received substantial financing from governments.
It also said non-consideration of the role played by the BCCI as monopolistic in the regulation of the game of cricket has resulted in the board flying under the radar of public scrutiny, encouraged an environment of opacity and non-accountability.
In July 2016, the Supreme Court had asked the commission to recommend whether the cricket board can be brought under the Right to Information Act. There have been demands to bring the cash-rich cricket body under RTI to usher in transparency.
The report, submitted to the Law Ministry today, states that BCCI ought to be classified as state within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution.
An analysis of the functioning of BCCI also shows that the government does exercise control over its activities and functioning.
... BCCI, falling in line with the foreign policy of India, did not recognize a player from South Africa due to their practice of apartheid; and that the cricket matches between India and Pakistan in view of tense international relations were made subject to government approval. The foregoing positions BCCI as a limb of the state, the law panel report said.
It said though the BCCI is continued to be regarded as a private body, owing to its monopolistic character coupled with the public nature of its functions, it can still be termed as a public authority and be brought within the purview of the RTI Act.
The report pointed out that BCCI has received substantial financing from appropriate governments in the form of tax exemptions and land grants.
The BCCI has enjoyed tax exemptions of thousands of crores, the report said. To be precise, between 1997-2007, the total tax exemption amounted to Rs twenty-one billion six hundred eighty-three million two hundred thirty-seven thousand four hundred eighty-nine. It may also be noted here that from 2007-2008 onwards, the registration of BCCI under section 12A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, as a charitable trust, was withdrawn, it noted.
The BCCI, it said, exercises state-like powers affecting the fundamental rights of the stakeholders, guaranteed (in) the Constitution. It is hereby recommended that the BCCI be viewed as an agency or instrumentality of state, under Article 12 of the Constitution, thereby making it amenable to the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 32, the report said.
It noted that human rights are sacrosanct and innately associated with the human personality. These rights...are to be respected by, and can be enforced against not only the state but also private entities.
Therefore, the BCCI should be held accountable, under all circumstances, for any violations of basic human rights of the stakeholders, the report said.
To support its case further, the law panel said the uniform Indian team wears contains the national colours and their helmets display the Ashok Chakra.
BCCI, though not a national sports federation, nominates cricketers for the Arjuna Awards. Parliament and state legislatures chose not to enact a legislation to govern the sport of cricket reflecting tacit recognition on the issue afforded to BCCI, it said.
The panel is of the view that the BCCI virtually acts as a national sports federation.
It said the BCCIs memorandum of association states that the Boards objects and purposes are to control, improve quality, lay down policies pertaining to the game of cricket in India as well as select teams to represent India at international fora.
Moreover, as per the statement made in the Lok Sabha, the central government has already been regarding BCCI as a national sports federation... since all other sports bodies which are listed as NSFs are covered under the RTI Act, it is inconceivable as to why BCCI should be an exception, it said.

Making Breakfast happen
It would be great to serve whole-grain waffles, fresh fruit, and low-fat milk each morning but it can be difficult to make a healthy breakfast happen when you're rushing to get yourself and the kids ready amidst the general household chaos.
Here are some suggestions to ensure that even in a rush your kids get a good breakfast before they are out the door.
Stock your kitchen with healthy breakfast options.
Prepare as much as you can the night before (gets dishes and utensils ready, cut up fruit, etc.)
Get everyone up ten minutes earlier
Have grab-and-go alternatives (fresh fruit; individual boxes or baggies of whole-grain, yogurt or smoothies) on days when there is little or no time to eat.
If kids aren't hungry first thing in the morning, be sure to pack a breakfast that they can eat a little later on the bus or between classes. Fresh fruit, cereal, nuts, or peanut butter and banana sandwiches are nutritious, easy to make, and easy for kids to take along.
What not to serve for breakfast is important too. Pastries, roles, patties and some breakfast bars are portable, easy, and appealing to kids. But many have no more nutritional value than a candy bar and are high in sugar and calories. Read the nutrition labels carefully before you toss these breakfast bars and pastries into your kids lunch box.
Breakfast ideas you can try
The morning meal doesn't have to be all about traditional breakfast items. You can mix it up to include different foods, even the leftovers from last night's dinner, and still provide the nutrients and energy kids need for the day.
Try to serve a balanced breakfast that includes some carbohydrates, protein, and fiber. Carbs are a good source of immediate energy for the body. Energy from protein tends to kick in after the carbs are used up. Fiber helps provide a feeling of fullness and, therefore, discourages overeating. And when combined with heathy drinks, fiber helps move food through the digestive system, preventing constipation and lowering cholesterol.
Good sources of these nutrients include:
Carbohydrates: whole-grain cereals, brown rice, whole-grain breads and muffins, fruits, vegetables
Protein: dairy products, lean meats, eggs, nuts (including nut butters), seeds, and cooked dried beans
Fiber: whole-grain breads, waffles, and cereals; brown rice, bran, and other grains; fruits, vegetables, beans, and nuts
And don't forget how important your good example is. Let your kids see you making time to enjoy breakfast every day. Even if you just wash down some whole-wheat toast and a banana with a glass of juice or milk, you're showing how important it is to face the day only after refueling your brain and body with a healthy morning meal.

The National Council for Road Safety Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said the government has decided to implement a rule making it mandatory for three wheelers operating taxi services to have a fare metre by April 20.
Last year in September, the Transport Ministry informed all three-wheelers to install metres in their three-wheelers by April 1. Three wheeler members, in response, said that it is difficult to install metres immediately and requested the Transport Ministry to extend the date. Accordingly, the deadline was extended to April 20.
The decision was taken in the best interest of passengers because three-wheeler drivers tend to cheat local as well as foreign passengers."
We expect to upgrade the quality of the three-wheeler service, he said.

Next Indiana Jones could be a woman
Filmmaker Steven Spielberg said he knows putting a woman in the lead role of an Indiana Jones movie would upset fans, but believes it's time the explorer 'took a different form'.
The role was made famous by actor Harrison Ford, 75. According to reports, Spielberg nodded when asked if this new-look Jones could be female, "We would have to change the name from Jones to Joan. And there would be nothing wrong with that."
The 71-year-old has been a vocal champion of the Time's-Up campaign for gender equality in the movie industry, and is no stranger to powerful women. His mother Leah, who died last year aged 97, raised him and his three sisters almost single-handedly because his workaholic engineer father Arnold, now 101, was rarely around. And he has been married to actress Kate Capshaw, 64, since 1991, after meeting in 1984 when she starred in the second Indiana Jones film.
He said, "My mom was strong. She had a voice; she had a very strong opinion. I have been very lucky to be influenced by women, several of whom I have just loved madly - my mom and my wife."
Filming for the fifth movie in the Indiana Jones franchise is due to begin in April next year. But Spielberg said, "This will be Harrison Ford's last Indiana Jones movie, I am pretty sure, but it will certainly continue after that."
That is when the director will decide on whether to go ahead with 'Joan'.

No-nonsense plan to curb traffic crimes
There is absolutely no road safety and traffic discipline in Sri Lanka. Politicians are doing very little to improve the traffic and road safety system. I have noticed the following dangerous hazards on our roads which require immediate action.
Main culprits are private bus drivers and three-wheeler drivers. I wonder whether they have the license or they have bribed to get the license and whether they are human. They seem to think they are above the law.
Private bus drivers are racing to overtake on narrow roads in order to get before the next bus to pick passengers. They are coming close to our vehicles and at a breakneck speed almost knocking us and our children. This is high-level criminal activity.
Three wheeler drivers are giving right signal and turning left or suddenly makes turns without giving adequate notice to the vehicle behind/ on the side or drive closely behind our vehicle without leaving space.
Traffic signals
At traffic signals even before the yellow light goes off and a green light appears, the three-wheelers and buses are taking off.
Traffic signals in some junctions are confusing without signs for a right turn or left turn - There should be simple easily understandable traffic light signals for the average educated driver. There should also be timers (second display) so that drivers know when the green is fading off or coming up.
The criminal bus and three-wheeler drivers must be only primary school educated and should be locked up in jail as they are risking the lives of so many people including breadwinners of families.
I urge the authorities (Legal system, Police and security authorities), Automobile Association and the public to work together and punish them thoroughly so that they will never repeat their crime again. The following action is recommended:
l Obtain the assistance of international community for technical support on formulating solutions to address our traffic and road safety. This can only be done if they are given a comprehensive understanding of our traffic and road safety issues. We could adopt best practices from other countries tailored to our local situation. This could be all done through teleconferencing and there is no need to fly in experts or our personnel visiting such countries.
l Police can take concrete action by having plainclothes policemen like CID to catch these fellows on the road and apply big fine. Then, everything will come to normal within a few days. This is how the system works in the Middle East which is very effective.
l Install plenty of cameras all over the roads to monitor traffic from a central control room.
l All citizens must observe wrongdoings of these criminals and take photos/ film it and immediately inform the police to apprehend them.
l In order to ensure that buses dont speed against one another, an electronic scheduling of all buses (government and private) should be done to ensure a second bus will start only after a certain time gap after the first bus departure. This will give all bus drivers equal opportunity to pick commuters and earn revenue. Peak hours could be allocated on a rotational roster basis so that all buses gain a slice from this revenue peak.
Corrupt politicians
Why should we citizens suffer due to the lethargy of the authorities How many parents are crying and have become mentally ill due to the loss of their loved ones in accidents
We are a nation of good literacy and if we cant fix these simple matters, then how can we develop.
I have witnessed the traffic and bus flow in London, Sydney, and Paris, Singapore and can tell you how well it is organised using simple technology. Passengers know the exact time of arrival of the bus at a bus station and regular updates are available. Our politicians take nice joy rides to these countries at the cost of foreign governments and NGOs but don't bring back any know how to our country. Instead, our people pay by way of taxes to feed these politicians and families, who in turn enrich themselves with further corruption. A stringent screening process for new political entrants is a must by all political parties and elections commission. A set of comprehensive criteria should be applied in selecting them.
We need the support of the politicians, corporate sector, foreign governments (for aid and technical support with strategies how to solve these issues), general public and Automobile Association and implement a no-nonsense plan to eradicate this. Any problem can be solved if there is strict enforcement.

No shortage, delay of subsidised fertilizer - Duminda
Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake yesterday assured that the government has already taken measures to provide subsidised fertilizer to farmers without a shortage or any delay.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Agriculture Ministry, Minister Dissanayake said that a circular mentioning the fertilizer distribution procedure has already been issued to all Agrarian Services Centres and agricultural officers at the grassroots level.
According to the Minister, a 50 kg bag of fertilizer will be sold to paddy farmers at Rs. 500 and the fertilizer will be issued through Agrarian Services Centres.
A bag of fertilizer for farmers who grow other crops including fruits, vegetables, tea and rubber will be sold at Rs.1,500. But they cannot purchase fertilizer only through the private sector and not through the Agrarian Services Centres.
Minister urged the public to make complaints about any sale of fertilizers, urea, TSP, MOP and sulphate of ammonia at a price higher than the subsidised price of Rs. 1,500, via hotline 0113 036666.
A team of officials headed by the Secretary to the State Minister of Agriculture has been appointed to take decisions related to next cultivation season and the dates of supplying water and fertilizers.
According to the Minister, measures have already been taken to supply required fertilizer stocks to the stores at Nikaweratiya, Galenbidunuwewa, Murukkan, Hanguranketha, Niyagama, Medirigiriya, Buttala and Bakamuna.

NOC chief says athletes should  be honed on overseas contests
Upbeat National Olympic Committee (NOC) of Sri Lanka chief Suresh Subramaniam has called for athletes to get involved in more overseas competition following Sri Lankas record- breaking performance at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games.
Sri Lankas 80-strong athletes squad returned with its biggest haul of medals at the Commonwealth Games  one silver medal and five bronze medals  with weightlifting and boxing providing the riches.
The success was welcomed by Subramaniam, the new president of the Sri Lanka National Olympic Committee, who recommended local sporting bodies should help pave the way for its athletes to take part in international competitions as much as possible.
This is where victory is forged. We have to encourage and support our athletes to participate in overseas events that is the key to winning medals, Subramaniam pointed out.
Taking part in local competitions will not help an athlete raise the bar, to go beyond his personal best. The only way they can do that is to regularly compete against other athletes from other countries. At the Commonwealth Games we have shown that Sri Lanka has talent. Now it is up to us, the administrators, to make it easier for them to win medals, Subramaniam added.
Weightlifter Indika Dissanayake led the way for Sri Lanka at the 21 st Commonwealth Games when on the second day of competition he lifted 297 kg in the Mens 69kg event to win a silver medal. His effort complemented the two bronze medals won on the opening day by Chaturanga Lakmal, Mens 56kg, and Dinusha Gomas, Womens 48kg.
Thilanka Kumara, in the Mens 62kg, and Chamari Warnakulasuriya, in the Womens 53kg, also set national records as they were narrowly beaten finishing fourth in their respective classes. Ushan Charuka also lifted 329 kg to set another national record in the Mens super-heavyweight category but could only finish eighth.
There was more success for Sri Lanka in the ring with boxing queen Anusha Kodituwakku, Thiwanka Ranasinghe and Ishan Bandara winning bronze medals to take the overall tally to six. It could have been better. Army lance-corporal Bandara could consider himself unlucky after he twice knocked his Indian opponent Gaurav Solanki to the canvas in the opening round in the Mens 52 kg class but was edged out in a split decision.
Kodituwakku came up against Indian boxing legend Mary Kom and despite a brave performance in the semi-finals finished second best while Ranasinghe also fought valiantly against Englands Galal Yafai. Both Kom and Yafai went on to win gold medals in their respective categories proving how difficult a hurdle they were.
There were success stories elsewhere too, even if they didnt finish in medals glory. In the pool. Sri Lankas Matthew Abeysinghe narrowly missed out reaching the final of the Mens 100m freestyle. Abeysinghe set a national record of 49.11 seconds in the heats but failed to produce this same time in the semi-final, 49.43 secs, which was the ninth fastest time. Only the top eight made it to the finals.
Then in the Mens 50m freestyle, Abeysinghe once again set a new national record, 22.65, although it wasnt enough to qualify for the finals. Dilrukshi Perera also set a national record when she swam 29.81 in the Womens 50m freestyle. The mens 4x100m freestyle relay also qualified for the final but were disqualified.
What was most encouraging was to see many personal bests and national records being set. This shows our athletes are constantly improving and striving hard to raise the bar, said an impressed Subramaniam.
It was the case in athletics when the Mens 4x100m relay team  Himash Eashan, Shehan Ambepitiya, M. Ashroff and Vinoj de Silva - set a national record of 39.08 secs to finish a creditable sixth.
In badminton, the mens doubles pairing of Sachin Dias and Buwenaka Goonethilleke reached the bronze medal playoff but failed to get the better of their Malaysian opponents in a straight games loss.
It was a creditable performance all round, not only those sports who won medals but others too. It is now up to us, the administrators to make it easy for them, especially when it comes to team selection.
The athletes must have faith in the system and should be picked on regular performances rather than one-off trials.
And it is very crucial that they compete against the best overseas, Subramaniam stressed.

Over 85% of businesses to invest  in digital transformation - Virtusa study
Virtusa Corporation, a global provider of digital engineering and IT outsourcing services that accelerate business outcomes for its clients, announced the findings of The Digital Transformation race has begun, a September 2017 study commissioned by Virtusa and conducted by Forrester Consulting, that reflects the digital maturity of firms worldwide.
The study evaluates the state of digital transformation across six key industries  retail, banking, healthcare, insurance, telco, and media.
The Forrester study confirms that while most companies are preparing to make digital transformation a priority, they have a long way to go before achieving any kind of mastery over the multiple disciplines required to effectively innovate, said Frank Palermo, global head of digital solutions, Virtusa. Firms that are obsessed with their customers experience can achieve significant operational efficiencies and put innovation at the heart of their respective cultures and are the ones that will see the greatest benefits from digital transformation. In todays business climate, with industries being disrupted at every turn, companies must be able to quickly change their products and processes to pivot to take advantage of new market opportunities. As the study finds, improving digital maturity will be key to meeting the changing needs of customers in an evolving marketplace.
The study was generated with input from more than 600 digital transformation decision makers in North America and Western Europe to explore the state of digital maturity across six key industries. Respondents included C-level executives, vice presidents, and directors at companies with revenues ranging from $250 million to more than $1 billion.
The study deployed a digital transformation maturity index, examining firms innovation readiness and competency across these key industries in three areas: customer experience, operational excellence, and business innovation. In all three areas, firms fared slightly better in customer experience compared to operational excellence and business innovation. The study also identified five levels of digital transformation maturity firms can reach  Curious, Exploring, Deploying, Thriving, and Mastering  to best synthesize the data from the maturity index. On average, firms currently fall into the lower-to-middle range of the Deploying category (26.06 out of 45).
According to the study, currently 85 percent of firms surveyed said they would increase the budget, their company allocates for digital transformation next year, with 37 percent indicating the increase would be by 10 percent or more.
The study also recommends that firms be customer obsessed by building visions for winning over executive stakeholders, establishing baselines to build digital transformation roadmaps, and putting innovation at the heart of their firms cultures to ensure greater digital transformation maturity.
In the age of the customer, empowered, demanding customers can exercise more choice than ever before in deciding which companies will earn their business, and which will fall by the wayside. To keep up, firms must invent or reinvent their businesses with technology at the core, or watch customers defect as their markets are disrupted, the study states, adding, To move forward on digital transformation, firms must evaluate their current capabilities, then plot a path forward accordingly. Furthermore, firms must move soon to keep up with the fast pace of digital change. In the age of the customer, firms must adapt or be swept aside.
Virtusa provides strategic digital solutions and services across a wide spectrum of industries.
These solutions are services designed to help companies transform their businesses, expand their addressable markets, and increase revenues.
Leveraging its strong innovation and digital engineering expertise, proven platforms, solutions, jump-start kits, and partnerships with some of the leading technology vendors, Virtusa helps global firms in their digital transformation journey.
Specifically, Virtusas digital offshoot, Virtusa Digital, works with Global 500 businesses in financial services, insurance, media, healthcare, and beyond to push the boundaries of user experience (UX), mobility, social, cloud, gamification, analytics, big data, and IoT to accelerate time-to-market, increase productivity, and improve customer service.
In this study, Forrester conducted an online survey of 606 organizations representing six verticals in North America and Western Europe to evaluate the state of digital transformation readiness today.
Survey participants included decision makers in customer insights, digital operations, or business innovation strategy. Questions provided to the participants asked about their current plans and capabilities in digital transformation.

## Title: Political possibility for Sri Lankan society
## Supertitle:

Political possibility for Sri Lankan society
The struggle towards Independence in Sri Lanka was a peaceful political movement which aimed at achieving freedom and self-rule for the country from the British Empire. For those pioneers in the movement, the political freedom was their greatest objective.
Yet seven decades after it was won, what that freedom has delivered measures up poorly for most of the citizens in the country.
Today, politics itself has come to be seen as impeding the decisive action needed to expand economic and social possibilities. In a society of swiftly inflating expectations, where old deference crumbles before youthful impatience, frustration with the current state of politics is perhaps not surprising.
Most independent political critics believe we are running out of time. The Government has to make choices. And, these choices will determine how we are going to handle the daunting challenges we face today.
Five challenges
Some months ago, World Bank pointed out that Sri Lanka has five main challenges that need to be addressed in order to sustain progress and fulfil development potential. Those challenges remain valid even today and it's worthwhile going through it again.
World Bank said the country has ample opportunities to build on its success due to its enviable location for trade, relatively educated workforce and remarkable natural assets. The Bank also emphasised that effective leadership will be needed to steer Sri Lanka forward on a path that will continue its strong progress in ending poverty and promoting shared prosperity.
The five main challenges which need attention are as follows:
Fiscal challenge
For many decades, Sri Lanka has been one of the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the world in spite of increasing economic growth and higher per-capita incomes. We did not have any tax adjustments in line with the economic changes. In addition, tax avoidance and tax evasion were not handled professionally.
The present Government has introduced a new revamped tax bill to ensure that all citizens pay direct taxes and cut indirect taxes. The new measure, according to the Finance Ministry sources, will support fiscal consolidation, make the tax system more efficient and equitable, and generate resources for social and development programmes. However, success depends on the implementation of an effective programme to raise income tax collection and to rationalize the widespread income tax incentives.
However, the immediate fiscal challenge is to improve the external liquidity position and prepare for active liability management. Given the significantly large external obligations falling due, especially beginning in 2019, potential actions include buying back and re-issuing longer-dated bonds. However, this is a short-term solution.
When a high proportion of revenue is absorbed to meet debt servicing costs, most Government current and capital expenditure has to be met on further borrowings. This will result in growth slowdown, leading to delays in key reforms in a challenging political environment.
Therefore, structural changes to public expenditure are needed to focus on investment in human and productivity-enhancing physical capital to return to a higher growth rate. The government should also develop a stronger programme for poverty reduction while preparing to take care of an ageing population.
Challenge of providing jobs for the bottom 40%
Sri Lanka has met the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of reducing extreme poverty and is on track to meet most of the other MDGs, out-performing other South Asian countries. Only 6.7 percent of the population live below the national poverty line. Fifteen years ago, it was around 23 percent.
It is important to note that around 30.0% of the employed population in the country is still engaged in agriculture and are producing food for 20.3 million people. The pro-poor economic transition cannot be achieved by abandoning the agricultural sector. Instead, sufficient attention needs to be given to increase agricultural productivity by improving extension services, introducing new technology and farming techniques, providing necessary advice and assistance to set up agro-based industries. Such comprehensive programmes could create new employment opportunities for rural youth.
The highest numbers of people living in poverty are located within the multi-city agglomeration areas of Colombo, Kandy, Galle and Matara. A critical means to end poverty and achieve greater shared prosperity is to harness urbanization for inclusive growth.
There are also pockets of high rates of poverty in the Northern and Eastern Provinces and within the estate sector. The high poverty rates in these areas are characterized by weaker access to services and poor links to the labour market.
Sri Lankas industrial policy has been broadly market-oriented since liberalization in the late 1970s, but the degree of outward orientation has wavered in the past decade. The introduction of para-tariffs has effectively doubled the protection rates, making the present import regime one of the most complex and protectionist in the world. Foreign direct investment remains below 2 percent of GDP, far lower than the levels of FDI in other middle-income countries, particularly in Southeast Asia. Sri Lanka also suffers from a skills mismatch, a result of the education system not equipping people with the abilities that businesses want.
Social inclusion challenges
High and growing inequality makes inclusive growth more difficult. Beyond a certain threshold, inequality could harm growth and poverty reduction. Although there was no specific goal on inequality, under MDGs, for SDGs, Goal 10 says: By 2030, progressively achieve and sustain economic growth of the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average.
Women can play a stronger role in Sri Lankas development. Females made up 53 percent of the working-age population in 2012 but only 34 percent of the employed population, a figure that has remained static for decades. If Sri Lanka hopes to tap into the productive potential that women hold to stimulate economic growth, it must work to develop greater support systems for women who continue to operate within current socio-cultural frameworks.
Governance challenge
There is good enough proof that during the previous regime, our country has been plagued by corruption, the absence of the rule of law, the heavy politicisation of all government institutions, including the judicial system, police and the entire political machinery.
The newly elected government in 2015, therefore, was tasked by the people with the responsibility to create essential conditions, a governing system to achieve self-reliance, sustainable development, social justice and the ideal functioning of a democratic government which could operate with efficiency and effectiveness. People wanted the Government to ensure that accountability both financial and political, transparency both financial and political, enforcement of the rule of law and efficient and effective delivery system of services and goods are implemented as soon as possible. Above all, they wanted the corrupt politicians and officials to be taken in and institute legal action immediately.
How far the Government has succeeded to date is under debate. The recent Local Government Election results projected some idea of the public thinking.
Sustainability challenge
Over the longer term, the country will need strong political leadership with a commitment to fight against deep-rooted corruption, non-accountability, non-transparency and inefficiency. It should also be able to provide a durable framework for national reconciliation to address grievances which fuelled past conflict and carry through with institutional reforms. What is most important is that the current leadership sets a trend and provides inspiration for new generations of leaders to emulate.

Politicians are destroying cricket in Sri Lanka: Muralitharan
Muthiah Muralitharan is a soft-spoken man, not one to get agitated easily. It was a rare sight to see him lose his cool when asked about Sri Lankan crickets downfall. In a conversation with Economic Times (India), the Sri Lankan legend talks about what is wrong with Sri Lankan cricket, why wrist spinners offer better dividends in good batting conditions (referring to Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal) and more.
Excerpts.
Q: What is wrong with Sri Lanka cricket
From the days of Sanath Jayasuriya, Kaluwitharana, Aravinda de Silva and Arjuna Ranatunga to today, it has undergone a sea change. Dont go so far back. In 2014, we won the World T20 beating India in the final in Dhaka and in 2011 we made the final of the 50-over World Cup in India. So what we are seeing today is a very recent development.
To tell you the truth Sri Lankan cricket is currently in a mess. Politicians have taken over the running of the game and with little or no knowledge of the game they are destroying the institution with every passing day.
Cricket is all about confidence giving the players the confidence to perform. Making them feel great when they wear Sri Lankan colours. I did not become a champion bowler in one day. For 4-5 years, Arjuna kept giving me the confidence.
Thats how I became who I am. Now every time a batsman goes out to bat he is told you have to score or else we will bench you. The same is true for bowlers. In the last one year Sri Lanka has fielded some 60 players across all formats. 60 players in one year! This is irrational and tells you there is no vision how the game should be run. Such frequent chopping and changing will only end up destroying the game further.
Q: But have the players done justice to the opportunities they have been given
Take the case of Kusal Mendis. All of us thought he was a bright spark and will serve Sri Lanka cricket for a long time. He started out extremely well. However, within months he was out of the team. One bad series and dropped. Such things do little to inspire confidence among cricketers.
Q: Moving away to something different now. Weve recently seen India prefer Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal over Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja because they get more purchase in overseas conditions. Wrist spinners rather than finger spinners seem to be the flavour. Your take on this
Wrist spinners will always give you better dividends in overseas conditions. Or more simply put in good batting conditions. There cant be any debate on this matter. They are expected to pick more wickets and I can clearly see and understand why the Indian selectors have done what they have done.
Theres always an element of mystery to wrist spinners and until this mystery is decoded they will deliver for the captain. I dont know whether Ashwin or Jadeja will be back but the reasoning behind the call is fairly obvious. And both Kuldeep and Chahal have done well and justified the faith shown in them.
Q: Are you saying that to be successful every spinner today will have to have something mysterious in his repertoire
While that is correct Im also saying you have to keep your core intact. I always emphasised on bowling off-spin first and then trying out other things. Bowling too many doosras, for example, can impact your off spin bowling and it has happened to people in the past. Thats what modern day spinners need to keep in mind.
Q: Coming to IPL, very good start to the season for your team
It is a marathon and the race has just started. What weve done is create a team that has real good balance. Many people asked why we chose Wriddhiman Saha. It was a clearly thought out strategy. Last year we did not have good spin back-up options after Rashid Khan. This year we do. We have picked Shakib Al Hasan as our first choice left-arm spinner.
When you have two quality spin bowlers in your team, its essential you have a good keeper. Else, the chances created by the spinners are wasted more often than not. So in that sense weve done what we could have. Now only time will tell if the planning gives us the results we are hoping for.
Q: A word on David Warners absence - you must be missing him
His are big shoes to fill. He has been an exceptional player for us and for any team he has played for. But there is little that can be done and I have to say Kane Williamson has led the team very well in Warners absence. He has the experience and has held the dressing room together quite nicely. - Economic Times

Prince Harry grateful to 'woman he is about to marry'
Prince Harry just gave the sweetest shout out to the 'Woman I Am About to Marry.' Prince Harry is sharing his optimism and excitement about joining forces with fiance Meghan Markle as they forge a new dynamic partnership around the world.
Harry, 33, said in a major speech on Monday that he is grateful Meghan, 36, will be at his side to help young peoples voices to be heard as he begins a new role as the Commonwealth Youth Ambassador.
Making his first address since being appointed to the position by his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, Harry said, I am incredibly grateful that the woman I am about to marry, Meghan, will be joining me in this work, of which she too is hugely excited to take part in. As he plans his first year in the job, he told delegates at the opening of the 11th Commonwealth Youth Forum in London, I know that serving as an ambassador to young people, I am going to have to try to keep up with you.
Harry and Meghan will undertake tours to Commonwealth countries and convene meetings in the U.K. to discuss how best we can make Commonwealth platforms work for you, and to ensure maximum impact, he said. Both here in the U.K. and as I travel, my job will be to listen to you.
Friends of the prince have told PEOPLE that he and Meghan see the Commonwealth as a perfect place for their international philanthropic activities, which match a lot of the charity work Meghan had done before she joined the royal fold. They are set to take part in some Commonwealth events later this week.
On Monday, Harry said he is drawing inspiration from the Queen, 91, as the ultimate source of guidance on all things Commonwealth, which is comprised of the 53 thriving family of nations linked to the U.K.
On the day of her 21st birthday, the then-Princess Elizabeth gave an extraordinary radio address from Cape Town. With an eye on the future, and an already unflinching sense of duty, she made a commitment, he told the delegates. She said that whether her life be long or short, it would be dedicated to the service of the people of the Commonwealth.
From that speech in 1947 onwards, she has known that young people really make the difference, Harry continued. Her call to action was for her fellow young people to lead the way in making the Commonwealth a more free, more prosperous, more happy and a more powerful influence for good in the world.'
And he paid tribute to the foresight of his father, Prince Charles, 69, adding, The young adults I have met across the Commonwealth have shown me time and again that your generation understands something very important: that to tackle a big challenge, you need to focus on the root causes, not the symptoms  something my father has believed for years, yet something society still struggles with.
You care. You want your nations to be cleaner, your planet to be greener, your friends and neighbors to be treated fairly and with respect, no matter their ethnicity, their religion, or their status, he continued. You are optimistic. The complicated challenges we face  climate change, inequality, conflict  they do not discourage you. Rather, they inspire you to persevere and effect change. The speech comes at an exciting time for the royal family: Kate Middleton is expected to give birth to her and Prince Williams third child later this month, and the countdown is on for Harry and Meghans highly anticipated wedding on May 19.
Meghan is going to be a force, a palace source told PEOPLE of the actors new chapter in the royal family. She will help him really define his role and relate to the public in a way that he wouldnt have been able to do before. It was worth the wait.

A shramadhana campaign was held at the Children's Park located near Mazoor Mawlana Housing Scheme in Maruthamunai under the purview of A. M. Rakeeb, the newly elected Mayor for Kalmunai Municipal Council recently.
The shramadhana campaign was the first phase of the development programme of the Children's Park in Maruthamunai. The newly elected Mayor Rakeeb took necessary action to clean the premises of the park to enable it for the use of the children in the vicinity, with the support of the employees and machinery of the Kalmunai Municipal Council.
Due to various reasons, the park was not properly maintained and enabled for the use of the children in the area.
Rakeeb said, "the mental and physical health of the children are very important than the others. Today, most of the children are not playing in the ground, but they all play games by using mobile phones and computers. They are addicted to the modern technology. It also helps them to learn and spend the time leisurely, but playing games in the ground only helps them to be healthy people in the world".
The Municipal Council Commissioner J. Liyakath Ali and Memeber of KMC M. S. Umar Ali joined with the Mayor A. M. Rakeeb to inspect the progress of the work.

SC turns down TRC appeal over TRN network shutdown
The Supreme Court three-judge-bench headed by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep has turned down a Leave to Proceed application submitted by the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL), objecting to the establishing of a digital television broadcasting network by Television and Radio Network (TRN).
The television broadcasting station of TRN which operated the popular TV Lanka TV channel from the year 2000 in Sri Lanka and throughout the world, was closed down by the CID and the TRCSL officers in May 2012, alleging that TRN operated a digital broadcasting network without the authority of the TRCSL.
At the time of forcible shutdown of TRNs TV station by CID and TRCSL, damaging equipment in the process, TRN had established a highly advanced version of DVB-T2 digital broadcasting technology, with H.264 / H.265 / HEVC encoding technology-based digital television broadcasting station. TRN had the capacity to broadcast 200 TV channels with DVB-T2/H.265/HEVC technology in this network. This was the first such operation in the whole of Asia.
When the matter was taken up at the Colombo Magistrate's Court in June 2012, then Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris ordered the CID to restore the television broadcasting station immediately to its original state, refusing the plea of TRCSL to continue the shutdown.
As the TRCSL was determined to closedown TRN operation, the frequencies assigned to TRN was cancelled by TRCSL in December 2012 and the request for extension of the frequency licence for the year 2013 was also refused by TRCSL.
TRN appealed against that purported action of TRCSL to the Court of Appeal stating that the action of TRCSL is ultra vires and TRN has all necessary licences to carry out digital pay television transmission in Sri Lanka. After a lengthy hearing, the two-member bench presided by then President of Court of Appeal, Justice Vijith K. Malalgoda, PC, allowed the appeal favoring TRN, disregarding the objection of TRCSL.
Counsel Manoj Bandara assisted by Lakshana Perera of Sudath Perera Associates represented TRN at the Court of Appeal, while Ali Sabry, PC, appeared for TRCSL.
TRCSL submitted an application for Leave to Appeal to the Supreme Court to get the order of the Court of Appeal set aside. This application was refused by the three-judge Supreme Court bench presided by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, PC, on April 4.
Counsel Thishya Weragoda appeared for TRN, while Manohara de Silva, PC, appeared for the TRCSL at the Supreme Court.

Although all schools have hit a winning streak they will however be looking for more victories. They will have plenty of work ahead of them with tough games left on the schedule, and the boys will need to consistently produce wins to be in contention during the second round. Players will be looking to keep improving their skills and show their worth so that the coaches know who will be in the reckoning.
The second round matches are going to be competitive, interesting and very close games with close finishes. The organizers must therefore ensure that there are no good games clashing on the same day.
Kingswood who are placed 3rd in Segment I A will play St. Josephs College on April 20 Friday in Colombo. Kingswood has won two against Trinity and St. Anthonys and lost two. They are well guided by Dinesh Gamage. They played well in their two wins and should look to a good combination for the rest of the games.
Trinity are placed 4th in the Segment -I A and will play their key game on April 21 in Colombo against Royal College, in the first leg of the most looked forward to Bradby Shield. Trinitians this time did not live up to expectations they beat St. Anthonys and St. Thomas, and lost to St. Josephs and Kingswood. Coach Lote Taikabula is going all out to put things in order but something is lacking in the Trinity line up.
They have not matched the level they should have; it was disappointing they failed to win the important matches. It was very clear that their defence, the contact play and attacking accuracy - weren't anywhere near where they need to be. In stages they play well but are unable to sustain any continuity, most of the time the options they take as a team go the other way. St. Anthonys College, who are 4th placed, were expected to fare well this season with all areas of coaching and player development taken care of, but somehow they have failed. They have lost all four games played so far in Segment I A to Trinity, Royal, Kingswood and St. Josephs. Their next game is on April 24 Thursday with S.Thomas at Nittawela.
Dharmaraja playing in the Division I Segment B coached by Kapila Silva, unfortunately have failed to win any matches in their segment. They have lost to Isipathana, St. Peters and D.S. Senanayake.
Their next game is with Zahira College on April 21Saturday in Colombo. Their coach has done his best, and have put them on the right path by citing the improvements made to his squads depth since he took over. But the players have failed to perform as a team.
St. Sylvesters playing in Segment  I B, under the coaching of Aruna Rankothge have played four games, out of which they have two wins against Ananda and Piliyandala Central and lost two games to Science and Vidyartha. Their next game is on April 24 against St. Benedicts College in Colombo.
Vidyartha College playing in Segment - I B have won all the matches they played beating Ananda, Piliyandala Central, St. Benedict's and St. Sylvesters. Their next game is on April 22 against Science College. A big hand to their coaches Sumeda Malawena and Danushka Pushpakumara former players of Kandy Sports Club for the excellent job done this season.
Sri Rahula playing the Division 2 Segment  I B under the guidance of Nalin Wijesinghe have played three and won all matches, against Mahinda College Galle, Presidents College Maharagama and Sri Sumangala Panadura and have to play Vidyaloka Galle, Zahira Mawanella and Eheliyagoda MMV.
Sri Sumangala (St.Pauls) coached by G. Gunadasa, are playing in the Segment I IC and have done their best by beating all the schools they met, Nalanda, Moratuwa MV, Royal Panadura by over 100 points and their next game is with St .Johns Nugegoda on April 24 at Digana grounds.

Sponsors role commended by the chief guest
The stage is set for the 40th anniversary celebrations of Sri Lankas first ever school cricket awards show  the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest. Making the grand occasion a historic one, the first-ever recipient of the most prestigious award in school cricket, former Sri Lanka captain Ranjan Madugalle is set to add colour to the grand finale as the chief guest.
The ex-Sri Lanka, Royal and NCC skipper turned ICCs Chief Match Referee is expected to grace the milestone celebrations of Sri Lankas first and the oldest school cricket award show which accounts for four decades of cherished history, producing legendary Sri Lanka cricketers.
For the past 40 years, it has remained the dream of every schoolboy cricketer as many believe that the prestigious title would give them a giant leap forward in fulfilling their ultimate dream of winning Sri Lanka colours. There are enough and more examples to prove this common belief as most past winners of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title had made their way to the Sri Lanka team in double quick time after winning the crown.
There is no exception this time around as three recent winners of the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year main award are in the current Sri Lanka team - Dinesh Chandimal (2009), Niroshan Dickwella (2012) and Kusal Mendis (2013). After being baptized at the Mega Show, the trio has become vital ingredients of the national team.
Beside Madugalle, Ranatunga and Muralitharan, Roshan Mahanama and Kumara Dharmasena are two other past winners who had made their presence felt in the international arena. The former Nalanda captain Dharmasena is the first player to win the prestigious Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in successive years, 983 and 1984. Although Ranatunga, the then Ananda captain, too had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title twice prior to Mahanama, Ranatunga had not won the crown on successive years. Ranatunga first won the coveted title in 1980 after Ranjan Madugalle but failed to repeat it the following year, finishing runner up to Rohan Buultjens of St. Peters College. However, in his final inter-school first XI season for Ananda, Ranatunga was once again crowned Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 1982.
It is no easy task to continue a mega awards show of this magnitude. As Madugalle had pointed out before, the sponsors play a key role in promoting the game and encouraging schoolboy cricketers.
The credit goes to Haliborange for coming forward to support Sunday Observers initiative to start the first school cricket awards show by becoming the sponsor of the inaugural show. Thereafter, the Bata Shoe Company took the baton before SLT Mobitel joined with a lavish sponsorship package 11 years ago.
The entry of SLT Mobitel as the principal sponsor, enabled the organizers to improve the standard of the Mega Show significantly, improving the quality of the event to solid trophies and larger cash awards.
The Observer-Mobitel partnership has not only recognized the achievements of schoolboy cricketers but also to rewarded their coaches and masters-in-charge, who make a silent contribution to produce the next generation of champion cricketers.
Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel is the proud sponsor of the Mega Show for the 11th consecutive year. Over the years, the mother of all shows has unveiled world famous cricketers, including Sri Lankas World Cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga, worlds highest Test wicket taker Muttiah Muralitharan and Madugalle.

Sri Lankas growth rate will rise to 4.8 pc: World Bank
Sri Lankas economic growth rate will rise to 4.8 percent next year, the World Bank predicted in a report this week.
However, the authors warned that accelerating reforms to promote competitiveness, better governance, and a more balanced budget, were critical to achieving higher levels of development.
The World Banks Spring Economic Focus report analyzed the economic conditions in Sri Lanka and other countries in the region.
They predicted that despite a prolonged drought, Sri Lankas economic growth rate would rise from 3.1 percent in 2017 to 4.8 percent in 2018.
Sri Lankas growth tracks with the region as a whole.
According to the World Bank, South Asia is again the fastest growing region in the world, bolstered by the economic recovery in India.
With the right mix of policies and reforms, growth (in the region) is expected to accelerate to 6.9 percent in 2018 and 7.1 percent next year, they said.
The good news is that economic growth is creating jobs in the region, said Martin Rama, World Bank South Asia Region Chief Economist.
But providing opportunities to these young entrants, while attracting more women into the labour market, will require generating even more jobs for every point of economic growth, he added.
In Sri Lanka, the working age population increases by 10,000 people every month, they said, adding that the market must grow by 63,000 jobs a year to maintain its employment rate.

SRK gives a nod for Vikram Vedha remake
Recently there were rumours that Shah Rukh Khan might not star in the Hindi remake of 2017 neo-noir Tamil drama, 'Vikram Vedha'. But now reports have it that the actor has finally given a nod for the project.
According to a report by an online portal, SRK wanted two major changes in the script, but the makers were unwilling to accommodate them initially. However, after Neeraj Pandey acquired the remake rights of the film SRK's demands were eventually fulfilled and Neeraj is keen on having Shah Rukh Khan on board for the project.
If reports are to be believed then Shah Rukh Khan was offered Madhavan's role in the remake but SRK demanded to play the role of Vijay Sethupathi. Earlier the makers were not sure about the same but latest reports suggest that they have agreed to SRK's demand.
Initially, there were reports speculating that the original director duo, Pushkar, and Gayatri will be directing the remake. But SRK wasn't convinced about the same and wanted Neeraj Pandey to direct the film. Reportedly the makers have even agreed to this demand. Official announcements of the project are yet to be made.
Currently, Shah Rukh Khan is shooting for Aanand L Rais 'Zero'. The film also stars Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif in key roles. 'Zero' is slated to release on December 21.

Taken for a ride
An enforced break because of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year has not slowed down intense political manoeuvring both within and without the government in the aftermath of the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and these moves are bound to intensify in the weeks to come.
The outcome of the motion of no-confidence came as a surprise to the Joint Opposition (JO) and sections of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). The comments of some former ministers such as Susil Premajayantha, Dayasiri Jayasekera and S B Dissanayake prior to the motion indicated that they were extremely confident of the no-confidence motion being adopted by Parliament.
In the JO, which spearheaded the motion, its de facto leader, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa initially resisted moves to introduce the motion until he was certain of a positive outcome. Following numerous discussions with the mainstream SLFP and having received assurances that a sufficient number of parliamentarians from the United National Party (UNP) will back the motion, Rajapaksa gave the green light to go ahead with presenting the motion to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
Speaking after the defeat of the motion, SLFP ministers acknowledged that they had been taken for a ride. They were unable to explain how, after apparently having received assurances of support from more than a dozen UNP MPs, the UNP voted en bloc to support Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. It was to cost six SLFPers their Cabinet portfolios.
No-confidence motion
However, even as the day began on April 4, the day the motion of no-confidence was taken up for debate in Parliament, it was a well-known secret in the corridors of power that the UNP had closed ranks and rallied around the Prime Minister. That was why 25 SLFP MPs absented themselves and thereby abstained from voting. For some of them, it saved their ministerial posts.
Now, the fallout from the motion of no-confidence has slowly but surely begun. The UNPs first reaction was to submit a motion of no-confidence of their own against the six ministers and Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala who voted for the motion of no-confidence.
Although Prime Minister Wickremesinghe asked the UNP MPs who signed the motion to withdraw it and they did so, the call for their resignations grew louder. The six ministers who voted for the motion of no-confidence were Dayasiri Jayasekera, S B Dissanayake, Susil Premajayantha, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, Chandima Weerakkody and W.D.J. Seneviratne.
Most of these ministers were not in favour of maintaining the status quo, although President Maithripala Sirisena indicated that he would prefer them to remain in the Cabinet. It was clear that the President would not be demanding their resignations or sacking them. These ministers, however, boycotted the first Cabinet meeting after the vote on the motion of no-confidence, indicating that they too were not happy to remain in the Cabinet.
Initially, the matter was supposed to be decided by the Central Committee of the SLFP, the partys highest decision-making body. The Central Committee meeting was a stormy one, with the majority of members stating that the SLFP should leave the government, an option President Sirisena was not keen to pursue.
Among the minority arguing that the SLFP should remain in government was former President Chandrika Kumaratunga. Kumaratunga strongly advocated the continuation of the National Unity government arguing that any decision to leave it would be a betrayal of the mandate received by President Sirisena and pave the way for what she called the return of the Rajapaksas.
resignation of Six ministers
It was against such a backdrop the President Sirisena finally reluctantly agreed to accept the resignations of the six ministers who voted for the motion of no-confidence. Along with them, ten others who held state and deputy ministerial rank also resigned, thus causing a defection of sixteen MPs from the mainstream SLFP.
Publicly, this group of sixteen have stated that they will sit on the opposition benches in Parliament but function as an independent group. They have indicated that they may support policies endorsed by the President on an issue by issue basis. Despite these public pronouncements, most expect them to now identify and align themselves with the JO faction of the SLFP.
That still left the question of what the remaining 25 SLFP ministers and MPs- those who abstained from voting for the motion of no-confidence- should do. Following discussions with President Sirisena, this group has now decided to remain in the government, retaining their Cabinet portfolios.
Thus, the stage is now set for a major Cabinet reshuffle. The reshuffle will occur after President Sirisena returns to the country from the United Kingdom, where he is attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.
The broad parameters of the reshuffle have been agreed upon, in talks between President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe prior to the Presidents departure to London. The SLFP, for the most part, will retain the portfolios it held and the UNP will do likewise but new faces are likely from both parties. There may be a few exceptions such as the Samurdhi Ministry, previously held by S B Dissanayake, being now handed over to the UNP.
The net result of the no-confidence motion, therefore, is that the strength of the government- more particularly the SLFP faction loyal to President Sirisena- has been pruned. Previously, the President commanded the support of about 45 MPs; now that number has dwindled to about 25 MPs.
Significantly, this would mean that the government, by itself, will now lose the two-thirds majority it enjoyed in Parliament. However, it could still muster a two-thirds majority if it can convince the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) to vote with it.
Therefore, the JO by itself does not have the numbers to thwart the government of a two-thirds majority. This could become a crucial factor if, in the remaining period of this government, there are attempts to bring about constitutional changes that require parliamentary approval by a two-thirds majority.
Sirisena faction of the SLFP
Consequent to the recent events, the Sirisena faction of the SLFP and the UNP have now moved to the next phase. This will involve the signing of a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two parties. The previous MoU lapsed on December 31 last year. Minister Sarath Amunugama, a former civil servant who began his political career in UNP who is now loyal to President Sirisena, has been tasked with preparing the new MoU.
It is expected that the new MoU will prioritise the governments development plans for the next two years and set out the guidelines under which the two parties would work together, without having to encounter difficulties such as the ones seen in the recent past.
Within the UNP, the introduction of party reforms is pending. Already, the partys Chairman Malik Samarawickrema and General Secretary Kabir Hashim have resigned. All new party appointments are expected to be ratified by April 30. Much would depend on whether there is general acceptance as to whether these reforms embody a real change of direction and a transformation of its image for the party.
In the final analysis, although the JO lost the motion of no-confidence and with it, some momentum it derived from its recent local government election victory, it may have gained a number of SLFP stalwarts to swell its ranks. The UNP, on the other hand, has rallied around its leader and if its reforms see the light of day, maybe in a better position to canvass for public support.
The big loser would be the Sirisena faction of the SLFP which now has to cast its lot firmly with the UNP, at least for the rest of this governments term of office, if it is to have even a semblance of a chance of making an impact at the next national elections which are due by January 2020- less than two years from now.
