Mommy blues!
Some trailers are better than the actual movie ever could be. Movie-trailer editors pick and choose the best bits from a film and string them together to lure unsuspecting viewers. Thats exactly what Bad Moms is.
The trailer had it all: three beloved actors playing funny women who turn reckless, hinting at comedies like Bridesmaids and Trainwreck.
Youll be drawn in for sure, but in the end, the film is a cringe-worthy call to appreciate mothers and for women to stand up for themselves.
The best part about Bad Moms is when the end credits start rolling, and here, I dont mean when you get up and leave. The end credits comprise an earnest montage of the actors with their mothers, talking about past mistakes and childhood. But heres what goes down before those credits start rolling. Amy Mitchell (Mila Kunis) is a 32-year-old mother of two who loves, loves, loves her kids.
Shes stretching herself to a sliver trying to balance a career and home. But her kids are demanding, and her deadbeat husband, Mike (David Walton), does nothing.
Done-to-death
Mila Kunis as Amy Mitchell
Amys arch nemesis is the she-devil mom Gwendolyn (Christina Applegate) with her posse of equally loathsome lackeys Stacy (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Vicky (Annie Mumolo). When shes had enough of it, Amy decides to be a bad mom and stop trying so hard to be perfect.
Following suit is Kiki (Kristen Bell) and already-bad mom Carla (Kathryn Han), who decide its time for a change. This displeases the she-devil clique.
In a done-to-death plot, our heroine  Amy in this case  crusades against the Nazi mothers who are forcing everyone else to be just like them.
Kunis ( Friends with Benefits ), Bell ( Forgetting Sarah Marshall ) and Hahn ( Were The Millers ) have already established themselves as far as comedy goes, so the acting definitely wasnt the problem.
Its all the scripts fault, thanks to writer-directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. The characters and their stories are exaggerated versions of reality: Amy is a mom who does everything, right from carting the kids around to taking the dog to the vet and even working overtime for a demanding boss.
Irresponsible parenthood
Kiki is a doormat who drops everything when her husband orders her to. And theres Carlas sex-hungry crassness (which is, sadly, the only thing really funny about Bad Moms ) which redefines irresponsible parenthood.
Ironically, Carlas behaviour has been glossed over and glamourised to the point that she decides to be an even worse mom, if that was possible. That these three characters were written by a real adult seems unfathomable.
Bad Moms is the kind of film you roll your eyes at, resigning yourself to endure it when nothing else is on TV and theres absolutely nothing else to do.
Even then, you question why your precious hours have been wasted. With its one-track plot (for women to embrace being bad), the film is focused, but theres nothing else really going for it. The Hindu

Chris Hemsworth: the next James Bond
Australian actor Chris Hemsworth catapulted to fame after starring as the Norse god of thunder in Marvels Thor franchise, but this time, word has it that the hunky actor might just take the place of Daniel Craig as British secret agent James Bond.
The buzz, and in my opinion, is that its Chris Hemsworth for Bond. He would be perfect. I am not being biased in any way, Bobby Holland Hanton, award-winning 007 stuntman, told The Mirror.
I think he would be perfect for it, and he has got a fantastic English accent as everyone knows from his performance in Rush, added Hanton.
The stuntman, who previously worked with Craig for the James Bond movies, said that Hemsworths physical prowess is enough to land him the highly-coveted role.
When Hemsworth was asked about the prospect of becoming the next James Bond, the actor hinted that he would not turn down the role if it was offered to him, but noted that there would be a lot of competition for it.
I dont know many who wouldnt jump at that. Would it be scary and daunting Of course. But what isnt he simply replied.
Aside from Hemsworth, rumor has it that Victoria actor Tom Hughes might be offered the role as well, according to The Telegraph.
Meanwhile, Hemsworth is busy filming Thor: Ragnarok in Australia, and he is grateful that his work is so close to home.
Thor: Ragnarok will be released on November 3, 2017.

Sonakshi reinvents herself for Akira
Sonakshi Sinhas movie Akira has created quite a buzz these days for its slick action sequences. In the movie, Sonakshi is seen fighting off a pack of hoodlums and reducing them to pulp with her kicks and karate-chops.
According to Sonakshi, she started training two months before the film hit the floors. Even when the shooting was on, I had to keep learning the judo karate kicks to make the fight scenes more convincing and gut-wrenching, says the actress who is reinventing herself with this role. Sonakshi is all praise for its director AR Murugadoss for deciding to do a woman-centric film. The actress also feels that girls should have a basic knowledge of self-defence.
When asked if it was really tough doing the martial art scenes, Sonakshi says that since she had been very active in sports in her school days, it was not that difficult to pull off action scenes as it needed quick reflexes and agility. From throwball, volleyball, basketball to swimming and discuss throw, I did everything, says the actress. Doing Akira has a special significance for Sonakshi as she feels now that women sportspersons like PV Sindhu, Sakshi Malik and Dipa Karmakar are bringing laurels for the country, it seems fitting that we celebrate the birth of a girl child in our country. After Akira, Sonakshi takes her action heroine tag forward with Force 2 where she is paired with John Abraham. According to her, the action sequences in Force 2 is more sleek and stylized not to mention some high-octane chase sequences.

Prince's Revolution Reunites for Tribute on Purple Rain Stage
The Revolution didn't come to party. Prince's best-known backing band reunited for the first time in five years Thursday night at First Avenue, the Minneapolis club their late bandleader made famous in Purple Rain, to publicly acknowledge his irreplaceability on the same stage they once shared. The night was struggle to determine how best to simultaneously mourn his absence and honor his groove.
I encourage every one of you to take every one of these songs and make them your own, urged guitarist Wendy Melvoin even before the warped church-organ drone of Let's Go Crazy filled the room. Her message was clear: Dearly beloved, we are gathered together to get through this thing called a Prince tribute, and it's not going to be easy for anybody.
The Revolution set out to recreate the music of Prince rather than re-interpret it. The complimentary synth styles of Lisa Coleman and Matt Fink, the funk-rock bottom of bassist Mark Brown and drummer Bobby Z., Melvoin's artful rhythm work  this was unmistakably the Minneapolis Sound of the early Eighties.
What was missing seems almost too obvious to mention. No one on stage could fill Prince's stylish high heels, and no one was dumb enough to try. And yet, there were songs that needed to be sung, and the Revolution explored all their options.
To start, they tried going it on their own, with Melvoin and Brown sharing vocal duties. This task seemed at times too much for Melvoin, the most visibly distraught band member, who also had to make the most Prince-like sounds that she could on her guitar while additionally serving as group spokesperson. The evening's most poignant moment was hers: a hushed Sometimes It Snows in April, fingerpicked on acoustic guitar and accompanied only by Coleman's keyboards and harmonies, with vocals verging on emotional collapse. Throughout the night, Melvoin's ragged competence was both harrowing and heroic.
They tried bolstering their sound by introducing other Prince sidemen. Buff and sleeveless, Prince's boyhood friend and first bandmate Andr Cymone brought real charisma and a sharp bolero hat to the stage, and he popped out a wicked bass solo on Let's Work.
A beaming Dez Dickerson, the Revolution's original guitarist, recreated his solo on Little Red Corvette with aplomb.
The band probably couldn't have tackled the Dirty Mind and Controversy jams they did without Cymone and Dickerson.
They even brought in a ringer: Philadelphia neo-soul singer Bilal added welcome vocal muscle to The Beautiful Ones, nailing the ecstatic screeches of its climax, bounding through Private Joy, and holding together a sometimes misshapen When Doves Cry. And yet, the more he approximated Prince's vocals, the more clearly he wasn't Prince.
Everyone had loosened by the first encore, Kiss, followed by an extended Baby I'm a Star during which the women from Prince's past filled the stage. Apollonia was there  she had also emerged earlier, regal in a shimmering golden gown, to toss hoop earrings to the crowd. So were Prince's ex-wives, Mayte Garcia and Manuela Testolini, and Wendy's twin sister, Susannah Melvoin, Prince's closest romantic partner during the Revolution's heyday. Prince's youngest brother Omarr Baker came out too, and tried unsuccessfully (but indefatigably) to coax the rest of his family onstage.
The final encore was inevitable. As they have for the four months now, the initial quivering chords of Purple Rain were fraught with anticipation, and Bobby Z's snare hit pierced the shimmer like that moment a roller coaster pauses before taking the first plunge.
The Revolution's version was wobbly and soulful, and felt, as every public sing-along and tribute rendition of that anthem has felt since Prince's death, cathartic and final.
We should know better by now of course  each time Purple Rain starts again, we just find a new way to mourn. And so will the Revolution.
They have two more First Avenue shows to soldier through this weekend. The Rolling Stones

Fans criticise Zayn Malik for collaborating on M.I.A. rape track
Fans have hit out at Zayn Malik after he collaborated on a M.I.A. track which uses a slang phrase about rape.
The 23-year-old former One Direction heartthrob sings vocals on the track Freedun, which was released by the Sri Lankan hip-hop star on Thursday (01Sep16). In the song, M.I.A. raps: I rape that button just to play this song.
The lyric means to repeatedly hit the replay button on video sharing site YouTube to watch and listen to a track over and over again, according to Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper.
After the track was released, Zayn's fans took to Twitter to vent their frustrations at the singer being linked to the controversial lyric. M.I.A used the word rape and Im disgusted Zayn agreed to collaborate on that song... its trash anyway. Get him out! one person wrote.
Why would Zayn agree to collaborate on a song where the word rape is used ew (sic), posted another.
M.I.A., who was slammed for sticking up her middle finger while performing with Madonna during the Super Bowl halftime show in 2012, previously said she created the new song with Zayn over messaging app WhatsApp while she was in India.
We just basically did it while I was here, the 41-year-old rapper explained last month (Aug16). We've just been going back and forth on WhatsApp.
I made this song a long time ago, and it was always a bit too mainstream sounding for me, M.I.A. said of Freedun. If I was going to have a collaboration and have someone like Zayn, this is perfect. It takes me out of my comfort zone and kinda takes him out of his a little bit as well.
M.I.A. also wrote songs for Zayn's debut solo album Mind of Mine.
She recently confirmed her fifth album, called AIM, will be her last. The project, featuring guest spots from DJ Blaqstarr, Skrillex and M.I.A.'s ex-boyfriend, producer Diplo, will be released on 9 September (16).

Seven JO MPs set to join govt: Isura
Seven MPs of the Joint Opposition (JO) are ready to join the government following the tremendous success of the Sri Lanka Freedom Partys 65th convention in Kurunegala, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said.
He made this revelation at a media briefing yesterday. We celebrated the golden convention of the party on September 4 amid many challenges. While addressing the Partys 65th convention, President Maithripala Sirisena stressed that the SLFP will contest the upcoming Local Government elections under the partys traditional Hand symbol while a number of leaders from 20 other parties were present at the stage, Devapriya said.
The President also invited other political parties supporting the SLFP and those who are willing to do so in the future to contest as a common front at future polls under the Hand symbol. President Sirisena said a SLFP led government will be formed in 2020 much to the joy of its supporters. He was able to win the confidence of the public within one day, within one moment with this brave statement, the Chief Minister said.
Although 38 SLFP parliamentarians in the JO boycotted the convention, the 65th SLFP convention attracted a massive crowd, which according to many political experts, was the biggest, SLFP convention ever. This is the first time in my political career of 25 years, that I too witnessed such a massive crowd. Many supporters missed the opportunity to take part in the convention due to the heavy traffic congestion along Kurunegala road. This clearly proves that the publics support is still with us, he added.
Devapriya also said that they were able to witness the positive signs of the reorganisation of the party during the convention.
All the JO members who alleged that the removal of 13 SLFP organisers was a plan implemented by the UNP to split the SLFP cannot remember that it is during the time of the former President that 17 organisers were removed and the organiser posts were given to UNP members who had just joined the government, Western Provincial Council Minister Gamini Thilakasiri said.
Therefore we invite all members to join with us and walk towards a new political journey without trying to tarnish the image of the party. They all should remember that we all are here in these positions, not due to our personal attractiveness, but due to the party and its name. Therefore they all should be grateful to the party, Thilakasiri said. He said anybody has the right to voice their objections while being in the party, since they have a democratic leader.
MP Kumara Welgama, and Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne are two good examples. They even represent the partys CC. But they never register their criticisms by leaving the party. Only immature inexperienced politicians act against the party and they should be forgiven, he added.

No truck with SLFP so long as marriage with UNP lasts: MR
The Joint Opposition group will be forced to stay away from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) as long as the latter is in alliance with the United National Party (UNP), former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said upon his arrival to the country following a visit to Malaysia, yesterday.
The observation was made when a journalist questioned the former President about the non-appearance of JO MPs at the SLFP convention at Kurunegala on Sunday and SLFP leader and President Maithripala Sirisenas invitation for all SLFP members to work in unity to further strengthen the party.
Addressing journalists at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), Rajapaksa said the policies of the SLFP and the UNP did not match and this was the reason why S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in the first place left the UNP to form a new party.
A visibly angry Rajapaksa also condemned the incident where Sri Lankas High Commissioner to Malaysia was assaulted by a group of persons at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Sunday.
He also urged the government to take appropriate action while noting that it was a very serious case.
Rajapaksas visit to Malaysia was marred by protests launched by a Tamil group and the Sri Lankan high commissioner had been attacked while he was returning after seeing off several Sri Lankan parliamentarians at the airport who were returning after attending a conference.
The Malaysian media reported that the mob had attacked the Ambassador with the notion that he was returning after dropping Rajapaksa at the airport.
