Amendments to Counter Terrorism Act
The government has come up with several Amendments to the proposed Counter Terrorism Act (CTA) that will replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).
These revisions come in the wake of serious concerns expressed at the original draft of CTA that it has retained the repressive powers of the PTA.
The proposed Amendments have been discussed at length at the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Security which met at the Parliamentary Complex on Monday.
A Committee member told the Daily News yesterday that heated arguments erupted during the Committee meeting when the piece of legislation was taken up. He said the meeting ended with indecision on certain provisions of the CTA including that of giving access to a lawyer before the recording of first statement of a suspect.
However, the member said the draft CTA along with the proposed Amendments was to be presented for Cabinet approval yesterday.
He said the Oversight Committee would take up the Bill again during the next Parliamentary sittings week after the Cabinet decides on what amendments to be accommodated.
The member said there was contention during the Committee meeting on the part of the TNA and the JVP that the access to a lawyer must be provided for the suspect immediately after the arrest and if not the Police could extract statements forcefully from the suspect.

Amplifying workplace diversity
International Parity at Work Day will be observed on January 11 every year, starting January 2017. It champions the value of workplace diversity  inclusive of all genders, ethnicities, sexual orientations, physical abilities and ages; and it raises awareness of persistent workplace inequality.
People across the world are creating events to celebrate International Parity at Work Day  and many Sri Lankans are getting involved: whether it is just a chat over tea and cake to explore how you will support someone who is different from you to advance  or a full blown celebration of the difference that people who are different from each other contribute at work.
The largest celebration so far scheduled in Sri Lanka will be held near the Viharamahadevi Park and includes speakers who will share many personal stories, including: how leaders have created excellent performance from cross cultural/multifaith teams; how young ambitious people have got themselves noticed so that they could progress at the rate of their talent rather than have to wait their turn; and how men struggle to succeed in female dominated professions  demonstrating that the gender challenge is not limited only to women.
Organisations and individuals interested in holding an event can publicise and share photographs/videos of their celebration on social media by using the hashtag #ParityDay whereby their celebration be reposted and acknowledged on the International Parity at Work Day official pages.
The inaugural Day will also be celebrated in London at the iconic Cheesegrater building, and with businesses and communities around the world holding individual events to show their support for workplace parity.
This years International Parity at Work Day also sees the launch of The Parity Pioneers Movement, initiated by a group of global professionals who seek to unleash world-class performance by amplifying the value of workplace diversity through leadership and cultural development.
In an increasingly volatile, uncertain complex and ambiguous world, organizational diversity increases long-term business resilience  and yet workplace disparity remains a critical global challenge. The Equality and Human Rights Commission found that progress on gender equality is grinding to halt1; Strikingly, too, sectors that are successful at promoting women to senior positions are not doing the same for minorities - and vice versa. The World Economic Forum currently estimates that economic parity between the sexes will take 170 years to achieve after a continuous and dramatic slowdown in progress.
Ishreen Bradley - founder of the Parity Pioneers Movement, commenting on the importance of parity at work, says now more than ever  in this tough operating environment, it is essential to support individuals and organisations to overcome engrained cultural and institutional barriers to parity, said The Parity Pioneers Movement in a press release.
The Parity Pioneers Movement aims to accelerate the realisation of brilliance and performance through inclusion and difference - catalysing world-leading performance by maximising the value of difference.

Automakers, suppliers team up to share costs of self-driving cars
Automotive suppliers and automakers are expanding alliances to develop self-driving car technology that can serve multiple automakers, as the race to put such vehicles on the road separates companies that can go it alone from those that need help sharing the financial and technical burdens.
While some companies, such as Tesla Motors, General Motors and Ford Motor, are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop self-driving technology in collaboration with suppliers  as many other features such as anti-lock brakes or radar-enabled cruise control already are.
What's going on in the industry right now is like a hyper version of musical chairs - and the music is still playing, said Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of Toyota Research Institute. Everyone is changing partners. BBC

Ban Ki-moon's brother and nephew charged with bribery

Prosecutors have charged relatives of former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon with conspiracy to bribe a government official.
Ban's younger brother and his nephew stand accused of offering money to a Middle Eastern official, through an American middleman.
They allege the two men bribed the official to use state funds to buy their building project.
Ban served as UN secretary general from 2007 until 2016.
He was succeeded by former Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres on 1 January 2017. Ban is now being seen as a possible future president in his home country of South Korea.
Ban's spokesman had siad that he was unaware of the circumstances surrounding the allegations against his relatives.
Prosecutors say that in early 2013 the South Korean construction firm Keangnam, of which Ban's brother Ban Ki-sang was an executive, was faced with growing debt and sought to sell a building complex in Vietnam known as Landmark 72.
In a 39-page indictment unsealed on Tuesday at a Manhattan courthouse, prosecutors alleged that he and his son Joo Hyan "Dennis" Bahn, a Manhattan estate agent, stood to make millions of dollars in commission on the sale, valued at up to $800m (657m).
US officials say that the two men paid millions of dollars in bribes and tried to trade on the prominence of their South Korean family name in order to persuade a Middle Eastern official from an unnamed country to arrange a purchase of the complex by that country's sovereign wealth fund.
Federal papers say the two even tried to secure a meeting to discuss the deal with that country's head of state during his visit to New York during an annual UN general assembly meeting.
Bahn, who has pleaded not guilty, was released on bail.
According to the indictment, a $500,000 initial bribe was paid to US businessman Malcolm Harris who presented himself as an agent of the official, with another $2m promised upon the closing of the sale.
But Harris allegedly double-crossed Bahn and his father and made off with the money. Neither Harris nor Ban Ki-sang have been detained.
"This alleged bribery and fraud scheme offends all who believe in honest and transparent business," said US Attorney General for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara, "and it stands as a reminder that those who bring international corruption to New York City, as alleged here, will face the scrutiny of American law enforcement."
Ban's relatives are charged with corruption, money laundering and conspiracy.

Basil's Malwana land 'valuation report' referred to Justice Ministry
The valuation report of the 16-acre land in Mapitigama, Malwana said to have belonged to former Minister Basil Rajapaksa, on which a court order had been given for sale by public auction, was referred to the Justice Ministry to obtain funds necessary for future action by Pugoda Magisrate and Additional District Judge Nilupuli Lankapura. The case was heard in the Pugoda Magistrate's court yesterday.
The case was filed by the FCID under the Money Laundering Act following a complaint that former minister Basil Rajapaksa had bought a 16-acre land at Mapitigama for Rs. 64 million and built a luxury house on it at a cost of Rs. 125 million.
Basil Rajapaksa and Thiru Kumar Nadesan, former deputy Minister Nirupama Rajapaksa's husband, were cited as the first and second respondents respectively in the case.
The FCID making its submission in court asked for court sanction to sell the coconut harvest of the land and deposit the proceeds in court in connection with the case. The FCID also requested a copy of the valuation report received by court.
The magistrate said the court decision regarding the coconut harvest would be delivered in due course and said the FCID would be allowed to obtain a copy of the valuation report after making the relevant payment.
Senior lawyer Nalin Ladduwahetty PC, who appeared for Nadesan, requested court permission for his client to travel abroad for business purposes.
The magistrate said the second respondent would be granted permission to go abroad for six weeks from January 25.
Rajapaksa was not present in court yesterday. The second respondent was present in court.
Further inquiry was postponed for April 25.

Behardien to lead SA in T20 against Sri Lanka
Farhaan Behardien will captain a new-look South African T20 outfit in their series against Sri Lanka later this month, which includes six new caps. The 13-man squad for the first two matches on January 20 and January 22 has only four members - Behardien, David Miller, Imran Tahir, Aaron Phangiso - who were part of South Africa's last T20 matches at the World T20 in March 2016.
Kyle Abbott, Rilee Rossouw and David Wiese were not considered because both have recently signed Kolpak deals to play in county cricket, thereby ending their international careers.
The radical changes to the South Africa squad - including resting regular skipper Faf du Plessis and several senior players such as Hashim Amla, JP Duminy, Quinton de Kock and Kagiso Rabada - come as a result of a packed fixture list which has seen scant breaks since last November. South Africa had three weeks between their Tests in Australia to the home series against Sri Lanka and will only have four days between the end of that and their trip to New Zealand. They have identified the shortest format, which does not have a major tournament coming up until at least 2018, as the area they can afford to experiment in.
South Africa T20 squad: Farhaan Behardien (captain), Theunis de Bruyn, Reeza Hendricks, Imran Tahir, Heino Kuhn, David Miller, Mangaliso Mosehle, Lungi Ngidi, Wayne Parnell, Dane Paterson, Aaron Phangiso, Andile Phehlukwayo, Jon-Jon Smuts.

Call to enshrine socioeconomic rights in Constitution
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) and the National Endowment for Democracy held the second of a series of public discussions on the inclusion of socioeconomic rights in the new constitution yesterday at the BASL.
These meetings aim to educate the public on pressing constitutional matters by encouraging active discussion among legal experts, parliamentarians and citizens, said Geoffrey Alagaratnam PC, President of the BASL and yesterdays moderator.
Four panelists each spoke for 15 minutes before engaging in a debate and fielding questions from the audience.
The first speaker, Professor Camena Guneratne, Dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at the Open University of Sri Lanka, said the time is ripe to include socioeconomic rights in the Constitution.
Civil and political issues are linked to socioeconomic ones. All are entitled to socioeconomic rights, she said.
Dr. Dinesha Samararatne, Senior Lecturer, Department of Public and International Law, Faculty of Law, at the University of Colombo, seconded Guneratne, saying that guaranteeing socioeconomic rights would strengthen welfare and reverse the trend of worsening quality of life for Sri Lankans.
She was against the idea that empowering the court to enforce socioeconomic rights was a bad thing: The judiciary is not outside of the democratic process. We have a competent and independent judiciary that has the expertise to deal with socioeconomic rights cases.
Rajendra Theagarajah, Deputy of Chairman of Cargills Bank and Attorney Niran Anketell were against including socioeconomic rights in the constitution, as both pointed out that there is no evidence that guaranteeing these rights constitutionally helps the poor and vulnerable.
There is evidence, in fact, that socioeconomic rights protections help the middle and upper classes who have access to good lawyers, rather than the poor, said Anketell.
He highlighted the problems of making these rights justiceable and raising the peoples expectations.
It is dangerous when the court becomes a forum for distributional politics, Anketell said.

## Section: Editorial

Chamal shows the way
Ex-Speaker and elder sibling of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Chamal R. has spoken. Contrary to the rumpus kicked up by fellow Joint Opposition parliamentarians, the modest and more temperate of the Rajapaksas, CR, while lauding the governments moves to create an industrial zone to compliment the Hambantota port project says that the harbour was constructed not to keep it in isolation but to link it to an industrial complex in the vicinity.
Addressing parliament, Chamal said, what he is opposed to is only with regard to land acquisition, with the story of a 15,000 acre takeover of land in Hambantota alone causing unrest among the people of the area, not to mention the 99 year lease agreement with the China Merchant Company. The senior Rajapaksa said if there is a need for more land they should be acquired from suitable places in adjacent districts.
He however commended Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for clearing matters at their joint meeting with the Tissamaharamaya Nayaka Thera, although this did not clear the suspicion of the people, and hence the agitation. Chamal was also aggrieved at the alleged government sponsored thuggery.
It is hoped that the fears of the people of Hambantota will be allayed by this clean bill of health given to the Hambantota port project by none other than a Rajapaksa himself. Rajapaksa senior, no doubt, is aware of the benefits that would accrue to his constituency by the massive transformation that the project will ensure. Hambantota is still a largely backward area in spite of the patina of modernity that Mahinda Rajapaksa strove to give it by the construction of a port, airport and international cricket stadium. A large segment of its youth are unemployed, with none of the mega projects launched in the area succeeding in bringing down unemployment.
A US $ 1.1 billion investment is certainly going to turn things around for Hambantota and the Rajapaksas cannot afford to let go this opportunity. That is, if the rest of the Rajapaksas genuinely care for the people of Hambantota. Obviously Chamal, the mature politician that he is, has seen the potential and hence his defence of the project.
True, the UNP while in the Opposition was critical of the construction of a port in Hambantota and even coined various derisive terms to describe the project. But it is now a fait accompli and time to move on to the next stage to realise its full potential. Premier Wickremesinghe told parliament that the first factory to be opened in the Hambantota Industrial Complex will be by a Sri Lankan and that 95 percent of the land acquired will be state land. He asked Namal Rajapaksa if they wanted a industrial zone in Hambantota or not and that there are many takers for such a venture among his ministers in their electorates.
It is unfortunate indeed that while Chamal Rajapaksa is dwelling on the virtues of the Hambantota Industrial zone project, his colleagues in the Joint Opposition saw it fit to lead a mob to disrupt the agreement signing ceremony attended by the Chinese Ambassador. The Police had no option but to act the way they did. There is no knowing to what extent the rabble would have carried out their violent protest. The Ambassador and other diplomats who graced the occasion had to be protected at all costs from the rampaging mob.
What motivated the likes of Udaya Gammanpila and Dinesh Gunawardena, great China lovers not so long ago, and who made nary a whimper of protest when the Chinese had virtually a run of the country during the hay days of their erstwhile boss, to act the way they did, is baffling indeed, unless this was another opportunity not to be missed on the way to once against enthrone Mahinda Rajapaksa. Where were they when Port City land was given gratis to the Chinese. Did they, who are today shedding copious tears over the alleged loss of land of the people of Hambantota, object, when a sizable part of the Port City was being earmarked for a car racing track, for the amusement of the Rajapaksa progeny.
The government did right by effectively confronting opposition to a development project that would bring immense benefit to a large neglected rural populous whose innocence and backwardness are being exploited by crafty politicians. A poor country like Sri Lanka cannot afford the luxury of protests and agitations against development projects meant to take the country forward. A big issue is being made by spokesmen of the Joint Opposition that Bikkhus were set upon by the police. They say that mobs and police did not even spare the Sangha who were about to chant pirith. No prizes for guessing who these monks were.
The Prime Minister has already given an assurance that no temple or archeological site in Hambantota would fall victim during the land acquisition. Besides, Buddhist clergy should conduct themselves with dignity and in keeping with the veneration in which they are being held. Hopefully the sentiments of statesmen like politicians such as Chamal Rajapaksa would strike a chord in the hearts of the people of Hambantota.

Chapecoense opponents win FIFA fair play award
Zurich: Atletico Nacional collected the Fair Play prize at Mondays FIFA awards ceremony after the Colombian side requested Chapecoense receive the Copa Sudamericana title following a plane crash that decimated the Brazilian club.
Chapecoense were flying to Medellin ahead of the first leg of the final when their plane crashed in the Colombian mountains on November 28, killing all but six of the 77 people on board. Nineteen players and 24 other club members perished as the accident tragically cut short their dream of playing in Chapecoenses first major final.
Atletico subsequently asked for their grieving opponents to be awarded the title, with South American footballs governing body granting the request a week later. Fans of both sides paid tribute to the victims as thousands, dressed in white and holding candles, piled into Atleticos stadium for the originally planned kick-off to grieve together and mourn those lost.
Its still a difficult time, it was a big final and the tragedy struck our opponents, its an indescribable moment, very hard to manage, said Atletico president Juan Carlos de la Cuesta upon receiving the award from former Barcelona and Spain defender Carles Puyol in Zurich.
Weve tried to manage this situation in the most dignified way possible. AFP

## Title: Chinese cars take over the automobile industry

Chinese cars take over the automobile industry
The Chinese car market is now the largest in the world. In fact it's massive and impressive, something like the world has never seen before, and will likely never ever see again. But what does massive really mean It means the Biggest, the Most Brands and Models, the Most Expensive and also the Cheapest. Heres why we feel that theyve taken over the global automobile market.
1. The Chinese car market is the biggest in the world!
The Chinese car market is the biggest passenger car market in the world. It became the largest in 2009, and has remained the largest ever since. In 2015, automakers sold 21.1 million passenger cars, up 7.3% from 2014. Its growth alone (1.1 million) is almost as big as the entire Australian car market (1.15 million). This year's growth of passenger car sales is forecast to reach 8%, which would size the market at 22.8 million sales, making China the largest market again, by a wide margin.
2. It has the most brands and models
The numbers of brands in the Chinese car market is recorded as 130 (as of May 2016), the most by any country. With three kinds of brands such as, foreign brands like Audi and Mercedes to local Chinese brands like Geely and also sub brands under foreign-Chinese joint ventures such as Venucia, the industry is truly multi-faceted. All in all there are 952 models of cars that is available for sale in China making it the most diverse car market in the world.
3. Has the most expensive cars in the world
Wealthy Chinese car buyers are unlucky. They pay far more for their exclusive ride than their fellow high-rollers elsewhere in the world. In the United States, a Mercedes-Maybach S600 costs $190,275. In China the very same car goes for $440,000, more than double the U.S. price. One more example: the Ferrari 512berlinetta costs $323,745 in the U.S., and $810,000 in China, just over 2.5 times more. The enormous difference is caused mainly by two reasons: high taxes and healthy entrepreneurship. Of course this is applicable only for domestic buyers in China.
4. China also sells the cheapest cars in the world
Less wealthy Chinese car buyers are also very lucky. They pay much less for an affordable car than buyers in other countries, because the market also has the cheapest cars in the world, in almost every category. This end of the market is the exclusive domain of the local Chinese automakers. Prices can be so low because automakers incur low labour costs, low development costs, and are often benefitted from generous subsidies of the local governments in the locations where the automakers are based, and you end up with a very low-cost and a very low-priced car. The margins are also thin as manufacturers focus on higher volumes. (China News)

Cibulkova, Wozniacki win in Sydney
Sydney: Slovakia's world number six Dominika Cibulkova dropped just two games in blistering heat to win her opening match at the Sydney International on Monday.
The diminutive Cibulkova, who upset world number one Angelique Kerber to win the WTA finals in Singapore last October, swept past Germany's world number 31 Laura Siegemund 6-2, 6-0. Cibulkova, who lost to China's Li Na in the 2014 Australian Open final, will next play Canadian wild card Eugenie Bouchard in the second round of the WTA lead-in tournament to next week's Australian Open.
When you start a season, you always start with some confidence, not doubt, but you always need to get into this match rhythm, said Cibulkova.
It's not easy if I would expect myself to play like I did in the (WTA) final against Kerber, I think that would be too much expectation.
Cibulkova, who lost to Agnieszka Radwanska in the Sydney final four years ago, was knocked out in the quarter-finals of last week's Brisbane International by France's Alize Cornet in straight sets. Kerber and Radwanska, the top two seeds, have a bye into the second round at Sydney. Former world number one and seventh seed Caroline Wozniacki dumped Olympic champion and last year's finalist Monica Puig out of the tournament 6-3, 2-6, 6-4.
Puig, who lost to Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova in last year's final, had 12 break point opportunities but could only convert three, while Wozniacki put away three of four break points.
British sixth seed Johanna Konta was too strong for Australian Arina Rodionova 6-3, 6-4 and fellow Australian Samantha Stosur again bombed out in the first round, going out 6-3, 6-1 to Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. AFP

Unwelcome traffic plan
While much attention is paid to the construction of the Central highway, no one in authority seems to be concerned about the traffic congestion at Kiribathgoda, which has now become a hub for most towns in the periphery of Colombo and the main approach road to Gampaha and beyond. Recently the main Kandy road from Peliyagoda was widened and carpeted, but the stretch from the Kelaniya University to Kiribathgoda town was not widened though carpeted. In addition, a pavement has been erected in the middle preventing the possibility of opening up an additional lane on the other side during rush hours.
This is an area where there are many container yards and many containers and heavy vehicles operating between the port and the free trade zone in Biyagama. At times it takes more than half an hour to get through a distance of less than one kilometre to the Kiribathgoda town from the University.
There are only two lanes on each side and those too are too narrow for a bus and a big car to overtake, thereby causing congestion. This is a great amount of waste of fuel and precious time.
Except for the area near the traffic lights, from the university the stretch of road in Dalugama seems to be the only area that does not have a pavement for the pedestrians. This is an area where there are many private classes. After classes, the students have to walk on the road at the risk of their lives. During rush hours, the pedestrians find it life-threatening to walk on Kandy Road
If the ministers and officials are made to travel by public transport or walk on Kandy Road in this area they would get a better understanding of the difficulties ordinary people have to go through.
Could the Highways Minister please look into this matter and bring about an immediate solution please

Colombo airport congestion  completely eased - Minister
The initial congestion caused as a result of the partial closure of the Katunayake International Airport beginning January 6 has now been completely eased according to the Minister of Tourism Development.
The airport is closed from 8.30 am to 4.30 pm daily for a period of three months to carry out resurfacing of the main runway.
Tourism Development Minister John Amaratunga who has been closely monitoring the situation visited the Katunayake Airport on January 8 and followed it up with a meeting with airline representatives and Airport and Aviation Services Limited (AASL) officials at his office last morning.
It was the general consensus among the airline representatives that congestion issues have been completely overcome and they in fact commended the authorities for their quick action to ease passenger traffic.
Following reports of congestion on the first day of the partial closure, airport authorities swiftly moved in to action to minimize inconvenience to passengers by introducing a series of measures, noted Minister Amaratunga.

Minister Amaratunga meeting airline, aviation and airport officials in Colombo yesterday.
Minister Amaratunga who visited the airport on an inspection tour observed first-hand the measures in place to ensure the smooth flow of passenger traffic. During a meeting at the airport which was attended by the Controller of Emigration and Immigration, AASL senior management, representatives of runway repair contractor, security heads and other top officials, the Minister inquired about operational issues and the measures that had been introduced.
The Minister was informed that the number of counters for check-ins, immigration and also customs has been increased corresponding to the increase in traffic. Having spoken to all the officials concerned and some of the passengers themselves I found that passenger flow was quite smooth and fast getting back to normal. It must be remembered that with 2 million tourist arrivals the airport is operating at 150% capacity, so until the new terminal is ready it's going to be a very busy airport, noted Minister Amaratunga.
Some of the other measures that have been introduced are queue management, entertainment for waiting passengers, additional seating arrangements, passenger facilitation services in the emigration area and free Wi-Fi for passengers.
During the meeting at the airport we discussed the feasibility of introducing a separate business class check in area to ease main terminal passenger traffic.
We are also exploring the possibility of enabling passenger check in at airline offices in Colombo.
Logistics and emigration issues need to be worked out in this regard, explained Minister Amaratunga.
Senior management of all airlines operating in the country expressed their satisfaction with the measures in place during the meeting with the Tourism Minister in Colombo this morning.
The passenger flow is better than before the closure. The relevant authorities must be commended for their pro-activity, said Chandana De Silva representing a leading airline.
We are also looking at the possibility of reducing the 5 hour check in time. Im confident this can be reduced in the near future, Minister Amaratunga said.

Country must be protected from new forms of colonisation: President
President Maithripala Sirisena vowed to protect the country in the face of modern avatars of foreign colonisation as the country commemorated 199 years since the Uva-Wellassa Freedom Struggle yesterday.
The Uva Wellassa battle was termed as a rebellion with those taking part in it termed as traitors by the British. On January 10, 1818, Keppetipola Disawe and 18 others were declared traitors of the struggle.
Last year, UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana pointed out this injustice in Parliament and asked that this ruling be overturned. This in turn led to the President directing Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to gazette them as national heroes and freedom fighters.
We have a problem in our country.We know that the modern era comes with new forms of colonisation. Moreover, the competition between world powers is something that has been present throughout history, the President said.
Given the geostrategic location of our country, we have always been an attractive prize for many world powers, President Sirisena said at a function held at the BMICH yesterday.
But today we cannot use Keppetipolas sword or T-56 and multi-barrels. Today we need to use our knowledge and wisdom to move forward. I promise that I am always ready to take the country forward as a unitary and prosperous nation, despite any challenge, the President added.
The President asked that the people come forward with constructive criticisms and solutions rather than problems in order for the country to move forward.
The President was also given a petition of 980 other names who were also declared as traitors by the British and asked that their names too be cleared.
Prof. K. N. O. Dharmadasa who delivered the main speech highlighted the friendship between Keppetipola and the Britisher Simon Sowers as an example of how complex human history can be.
Keppetipola was fighting against the British but continued to be friends with Sowers to the end. Keppetipola had asked him to attend his execution which the former refused. The story highlights the important principles of Buddhism, of kindness and friendship which Keppetipola upheld.
Keppetipola who was one of the Kandyan officials who signed the Kandyan Convention and later worked for the British, it is said regretted his decision having realized that the British would never
allow them to practice their religion, culture and way of life freely.
He realized that self-rule was the only option. The struggle started when people think back and ask themselves if they did the right thing,Prof Dharmadasa said.
History needs to be looked at with all its human complexities. There were some who betrayed the people to the British in return for monetary benefits, some actually preferred to work under the British, then you have those like Keppetipola who turned around and fought and the people who protected their leaders, observed Professor Dharmadasa.

Drone journalism in Sri Lanka: Ethics, regulations and guidelines
The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles commonly known as drones for commercial and private use has grown recently, especially with airspace restrictions around airspace being relaxed after the war, states a Media Ministry release.
The media release is as follows:
The Media Ministry is aware of footage taken by drones, by citizens as well as tourists visiting Sri Lanka, widely available across social media as online video platforms. we recognise that many events today in their promotional material or live coverage feature the use of drones and we also note their use in health applications, precision agriculture practices (smart farming), the coverage of public rallies the aftermath of natural disasters, around disaster risk reduction, sporting events and private functions such as weddings and parties.
Given the increasing availability of high-end consumer drones in Sri Lanka, the manufacture
of sophisticated drones within the country and with their purchase price dropping, the Media Ministry expects their use in commercial and recreational purposes, including in the field of journalism, to grow rapidly.
The Media Ministry issuing a statement said it fully supports the use of drones by journalists and media personnel in pursuit of their professional news gathering operations and coverage of events, places and processes.
However, given a rapid increase in usage and the evolving nature of drone technology, the Ministrys primary responsibility is to ensure usage of drones for journalism is in compliance with existing rules and regulations and conducted in a manner that is, above all else, safe, ethical and respects the privacy of citizens.
Recent media coverage around the exhumation of slain journalist Lasantha wickrematunges body in Colombo to the coverage of the unrest in Hambantota, have focused on the use of drones by media organisations and raised questions around regulations, ethics and professionalism.
The Media Ministry insisted that the use of drones for journalism must be at all times, in compliance with the regulations issued by the civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL) in February 2016, CA-IS-2016-GEN-001 titled, Requirements for Operation of Pilot-less Aircraft (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles/Remotely piloted Aircraft), available freely on its website. Those who fly drones for purposes of journalism need to read these regulations in full and abide by them.
Key points include;
* A pilot-less aircraft of gross mass of more than 25 kg shall not be operated unless explicit approval from Director General of Civil Aviation has been obtained.
*A pilot-less aircraft with a gross mass of between 1 kg and 25 kg may be operated under the authority of the Director General of Civil Aviation, an approved person or approved organization.
*A pilot-less aircraft with a gross mass of less than I kg may be operated without approval from the Director General of Civil Aviation if it is operated for leisure or education purposes at a private premise with the consent of the property owner or at public places which are clearly identified for the purpose, with due regard to safety of persons and property.
* An identification stamp on a pilot-less aircraft shall indicate its identification number.
owners national identity card number and his/her contact details.
* Pilot-less aircraft of any weight category shall not be operated for hire or reward, unless special approval is obtained from the Director General of Civil Aviation in writing after payment of the specified fee on a case by case basis.
* A pilot-less aircraft of any weight category shall not be operated unless its method of propulsion, source of power and means of controls are checked and verified for normal operations prior to flight, ensuring safe operations without endangering persons or property.
* A pilot-less aircraft shall not be operated by any person if he or she;
1. is not familiar with operations and maneuvering of the aircraft safely.
2. is not in good physical and mental health condition,
3. is under the influence of alcohol or psychoactive substance;
4. does not have a sound sense of social responsibility.
5. A pilot-less aircraft shall not be operated on or within 5 miles of the boundary of an airport and must not be operated at a height of more than 400 feet above ground level unless otherwise approved by the Director General of civil Aviation.
Unless otherwise authorized by the Director General of Civil Aviation in writing, a pilot-less aircraft shall not be operated in any part of Sri Lanka;
a. on or over any movement area of an active aerodrome; or on or over any active runway strip area;or
b. over assembly of persons or public gatherings; or
c. over congested areas; or
d. along or over roadway or railway; or
e. below or above open electricity power lines; or
f. within proximity to communication towers;
g. national park, protected areas or security establishments without approval
A pilot-less aircraft must not be operated;
a above any property unless explicit prior consent has been obtained from persons
occupying that property or the property owner; and
b. causing safety or security hazard to third person or property
Nothing shall be dropped nor shall any banner be displayed in a pilot-less aircraft in flight
without approval from the Director General of civil Aviation.
A person who operates a pilot-less air craft must at all times,
a. maintain visual line of sight with the aircraft; and
b. be able to see the surrounding airspace in which the aircraft is operating; and
c. maintain the aircraft below the cloud base.
Pilot-less aircraft shall not be operated in a race or competition of any form, without special approval from the Director General of Civil Aviation.
A pilot-less of aircraft shall not be operated from dusk to dawn (night) In particular, the CAASLs point about keeping a drone within the pilot,s line of sight is important to underscore, with media reports around the incident in Hambantota involving the drone by a private TV station clearly flagging the distance between pilot and drone to be well beyond human vision.
The Media Ministry is keen to work with the Civil Aviation Authority and other relevant bodies in the near future to streamline these regulations and make it easier for accredited media organisations to obtain permission to fly drones. We will also work with the larger media community, including those who not formally part of any media institution and are keen to use drones for joumalistic purposes in orderto facilitate approval. We recognise that existing processes in place for the approval of drones can be cumbersome and will work with the CAASL to both simplify and hasten submission and approval procedures. The Media Ministry also intends to raise awareness of existing rules and regulations through material released to the public domain and also through workshops, presentations and structured interactions with relevant authorities, importers and manufacturers of drones, commercial industry and the media community.
In addition to existing CAASL regulations, the Media Ministry stresses the need to keep in mind existing ethical and professional guidelines.
Overarching ethical guidelines flagged by the Editors Guild and in the Colombo Declaration on Media Freedom and Social Responsibility, amongst other industry guidelines, remain deeply relevant and applicable for drone journalism.
In addition, the Ministry will work with relevant govemment authorities as well as key journalists and drone journalism experts to formulate guidelines in line with international standards and norms applicable to Sri Lanka.
We request all those who fly drones to do so with the awareness that while they may be seen as toys, in their actual use and operation, they can lead to hurt, harm and litigation if inappropriately deployed. Respecting ethics, privacy and being mindful of the safety of those under and around the theatre of flight operations must be paramount.
We again remind all media personnel to read and comply with CAASL regulations noted in this press release and any associated material published on their website around the use of drones. Please get in touch with us for clarifications and also with any assistance you require in approaching the CAASL for drone operations in the pursuit of a professional media culture in Sri Lanka.

Established on June 14, 1973: Sri Lanka Press Councils Forward March since its origin
Sri Lankas Press Council has become the topic of the day on several occasions during the recent past within intellectual circles referring to Right to Information and press freedom, which created a massive social uproar fuelled by comments of the print and electronic media channels. Thus the need has arisen to outline the pathway of the Sri Lanka Press Council and its present role.
The Sri Lanka Press Council was first established as a Statutory Board on June 14, 1973, as per Regulations of the Press Council Act No 05 of 1973 under the purview of the then Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Its present Line Ministry is the Ministry of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media
SLPC Chairman Koggala Wellala in a media-awareness programme.
The Sri Lanka Press Council was operated under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting from year 1973 to 1977, under the State Ministry from year 1977 to 1989, under the Ministry of Cultural and Information from year 1989 to 1994, under the Ministry of Mass Media, Tourism and Aviation from year 1994 to 1997, under the Ministry of Postal, Telecommunication and Mass Media from year 1997 to 1999, under the Ministry of Mass Media and Information from year 1999 to 2000 and for a short period from year 2000 to 2001 under the President.
At its inception in 1973, the first Board of Directors of the Sri Lanka Press Council consisting of six members was presided over by its first Chairman Senior Counsel A. K. Premadasa.
The Director of Information was an Ex-officio member in the Board of Directors. The greatest challenge before the first Board of Directors was to establish its impartial identity as an independent institution. As a result, it was the responsibility of the Sri Lanka Press Council to respect both parties; the complainant and the respondent, maintain an amicable environment within complaints inquired before the Council and to bring in justice to both parties in accordance with the Sri Lanka Press Council Law and its rules, while it was further responsible in making the society aware of its process of bringing in justice. Within a short period of time, the Sri Lanka Press Council was able to ensure its stand as an institution, which would not become a threat to press freedom.
The relationship between the journalists and the Sri Lanka Press Council had gradually grown as a result of journalists receiving the respect and dignity they deserved from the Sri Lanka Press Council. With the decisions of the Press Council, it was evident that press freedom would not be challenged by the Press Council. At the end of its first term, complainants and defendant journalists were mutually settling disputes at hearings before the Press Council and it was quite a victory for the Council to reach such status within a minimal period of three years.
Its first Chairman, Senior Counsel A.K. Premadasa, who rendered yeoman service to create the legal framework and physical infrastructure required for its firm establishment, had said goodbye to his post in 1974. Later, a veteran politician well-revered in the Government as well as in the Opposition and a Barrister, P.M. William de Silva, had been appointed for the post and served till 1977. After William de Silva, Presidents Counsel J.W. Subasinghe was appointed to the post in 1978 and served till 1986.
Code of conduct
With the clearing of initial hurdles, the Press Council had taken measures to introduce a Code of Conduct in 1981 with the contribution of veterans in the field, University lecturers, clergy and various mass organizations. The prime objective of this Code of Conduct was to encourage journalists to act with self-discipline rather than legal pressurizing.
Accordingly, the main focus of the Press Council during this decade (1973  1983) was to demolish negative responses aimed at the Council and to conduct fair and unprejudiced inquires and to cement the fact that the Press Council is vital for the betterment of Democracy. But at the time, the Press Council had been a novel experience in Sri Lanka and therefore, many were there to find fault with.
During the decade from 1983 to 1992, the misconception that the Press Council was an obstacle to press freedom had been dissolved. The few years of this decade had gone in history as the period in which the proposal of conducting seminars, workshops, courses and publication of literature on journalism had been submitted to the Board of Directors. Puwathpath Kala Sameeksha  I, the first compilation published by the Press Council had been first published in year 1992.
After the tenure of Presidents Counsel J.W. Subasinghe in 1986, Attorney-at-Law M. Hussain had been appointed in year 1987 and had served till year 1991. Later in the year, Attorney-at-Law A.L.M. Fernando, was appointed as Chairman.
During the decade 1993  2002, the first publication of Puwathpath Kala Sameeksha  I, was launched by the Sri Lanka Press Council in 1993, Prof. Sunanda Mahendra had been the Consultant Editor, along with the contribution of all other veterans in the field. Furthermore, it had provided the opportunity for a series of controversial articles expressing views on various subjects in different perspectives. Journalists too had voluntarily appreciated this compilation. Puwathpath Kala Sameeksha  I can be recognized as standard literature related to the field of mass media. Subsequently launched was Puwathpath Kala Sameeksha  II, which had also been widely acknowledged. Some journalists referred it as Pen Thudaka Aravindaya (Blooming of a Fountain). Even today, these two books are used as hand books in Universities in the stream of mass communication. Furthermore, the book An Access to Provincial News reporting (2000) published by the Press Council is a guide to provincial journalists.

The primary focus of Puwathpath Kala Sameeksha  III (2003) was to present a scientific research study on obscene publications. This book had achieved key attention among a handful of publications on the subject within Sri Lanka.
Conducting of workshops and seminars
Sri Lanka Press Council has continued to conduct workshops and seminars and during the year 2002 alone, 35 awareness workshops for students and journalists. In addition, several diploma courses; i.e. Preparatory Diploma in Print Media, Bi-lingual Training Programme for Journalists and language proficiency courses were introduced by the Press Council.
During the decade, several professionals have chaired the Sri Lanka Press Council from time to time. After the farewell of Attorney-at-Law A.L.M. Fernando in year 1994, Attorney-at-Law A.A. De Silva was appointed to the post in the same year and held the post till 1997. In year 1998, Dr. P.V.J. Jayasekara was the Chairman of the Press Council. Later Dr. Jayasekara bid farewell in year 1999. A renowned Presidents Counsel in Sri Lanka Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapaksha was appointed as its Chairman in year 2000, where he continuously served till year 2001. During his tenure, the Sri Lanka Press Council was able to remarkably achieve its desired goals.
In year 2009, a Board of Directors chaired by Prof Somarathna Balasooriya was appointed to the Press Council. Gradually, the conducting of various courses and workshops and the launching of publications had re-commenced.
Veteran Presidents Counsel W. Dayarathna held the post of Chairman from year 2010 to 2014. In year 2015, the Council had proceeded under the presidency of another reputed Advocate as well as writer, author and critic Counsel Koggala Wellala Bandula, while further reactivating various programmes. Accordingly, following in the footsteps of the previous chairmen, complaints received against newspapers were inquired systematically, efficiently and in an unbiased manner. Even though a number of complaints have been received by the Council, less than 10 complaints have issued orders of correction. It is the anticipation of the Council to conduct inquiries with the concurrence of the two parties and to ensure public rights, while making press freedom more meaningful.
90 percent of complaints received investigated 
From the date of its re-functioning, the Press Council had received many complaints from which investigations of over 90% of the above had been completed. Whenever the Council receives a complaint, it takes every possible effort to initiate investigations at its earliest and to arrive at conclusion within a period of 3 months.
In keeping with the recent social, economical and political changes, the Sri Lanka Press Council too has changed its perspectives. Accordingly, awareness of journalists and their welfare have become its foremost priorities. It is the expectations of the Council to create journalists, who could face future challenges by being empowered with theoretical and practical subject-related knowledge and also to engage them in the national development drive and create well-disciplined modern media culture. Among the programmes initiated in realizing the above goals, is the one year Diploma in Journalism and Communication Studies. The Diploma is designed for professional journalists as well as new entrants in the field and it has been based on UNESCO guidelines on journalism training. The awarding of certificates of the 4th batch of this Diploma was held recently under the patronage of the President and the participation of line Ministers. Studies of the 5th batch are currently underway, while the course co-ordinator was Prof. Sunanda Mahendra.
The Council is of the view that re-commencing the English Language Certificate course was initiated with the intentions of upgrading language proficiency of professional journalists. Furthermore, the Council conducts seminars and discussions on the subject prescribed for the G.C.E. (A/L); Media and Communication Studies to update the knowledge of students in rural areas away from the city of Colombo. Accordingly, a number of workshops were conducted at Education Zonal levels. It is expected to upgrade media literacy and appreciation in school students.
Media workshops conducted at district level
Media workshops conducted for provincial journalists have turned effective and attracted many journalists. Media workshops are being conducted at district level on selected contemporary significant issues in view of upgrading theoretical and practical knowledge of provincial journalists. The workshop organized under the patronage of the Minister and Deputy Minister and conducted for journalists in Jaffna in March the previous year, was quite significant.
Sri Lanka Press Council identifies and conducts research on contemporary and significant issues with social and cultural repercussions and guides respective parties in its relation. Accordingly, the Council is currently conducting several researches in collaboration with universities.
Since its inception in year 1973, the Press Council has launched several publications from time to time. Even though these publications were centered around journalists and journalism at the beginning, the Council has decided to launch publications to cover various other media. Accordingly, the magazine Maadya Sameeksha I was launched in year 2010. In year 2011, five hand books for journalists named Sannivedana Vividhanga  (Source and Development of Sri Lankan Newspapers, An Introduction to Media Literacy, Language and Communication, Media Education and Newspapers and An Introduction to Photographic Journalism). Sri Lanka Press Council has launched Maadya Sameeksha - II to coincide with its 40th Anniversary which had been edited by senior journalist Karunadasa Sooriyarachchi.
Among other functions conducted by the Press Council, we find conducting subject related seminars and workshops at the request of private institutions and organizations, registration of School Media Associations, conducting Symposium on significant publications and conducting a series of monthly seminars.
With the establishment of the Sri Lanka Press Council in year 1973, registration of newspapers had become one of its prime objectives. In the absence of a central systematized state institution for registration of newspapers, the Sri Lanka Press Council has been able to ensure the nature of newspapers in Sri Lanka in accordance with the highest recognized standards as well as to discourage obscene or defamatory newspapers. Therefore, registration of newspapers has become the most significant function of the Press Council today.
Chairmen and Board of Directors appointee from time to time had been well-versed veterans equipped with knowledge and experience in each field. The services of the members of previous and current Boards of Directors in successful and effective operation of the functions of the Council should be appreciated. In addition, the contribution of the Press Commissioners, who were responsible for its administration during the past forty years, is commendable.
Senior panel of experts at the helm
A senior panel of experts representing diverse disciplines act as members of the present Board of Directors. Senior Attorney Koggala Wellala Bandula (Chairman), Prof. Sunanda Mahendra, Prof. Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa, Senior Journalist Gamini Sumanasekara, Senior Journalist Ariyananda Dombagahawatta, Senior Journalist S. Thillainathan and Dr Ranga Kalansooriya, Director General of Information function as Board members.
It will be the expectation of the Sri Lanka Press Council to continue the service rendered by the Council during the past four decades amidst public accolades in a far more attractive and effective way, while educating journalists and securing press freedom as well as public rights in realization of the ultimate goals of creating a better media culture.

European Commission proposes GSP+ concessions

The European Commission has proposed GSP+ concessions to Sri Lanka in exchange of the government's committment to ratify 27 international conventions on human rights, labour conditions, protection of the environment and good governance.
In a statement today the European Commission said, The European Commission today proposed that a significant part of the remaining import duties on Sri Lankan products should be removed by the European Union in exchange for countrys commitment to ratify and effectively implement 27 international conventions on human rights, labour conditions, protection of the environment and good governance.
These one-way trade preferences would consist of the full removal of duties on 66% of tariff lines, covering a wide array of products including textiles and fisheries, the statement further said.
It quoted Trade Commissioner Cecelia Malmstrm as saying  GSP+ preferences can make a significant contribution to Sri Lankas economic development by increasing exports to the EU market. But this also reflects the way in which we want to support Sri Lanka in implementing human rights, rule of law and good governance reforms. I am confident of seeing timely and substantial further progress in these areas and the GSP+ dialogue and monitoring features will support this reform process. This should include making Sri Lankan counter-terrorism legislation fully compatible with international human rights conventions.
It also added that Granting access to the GSP+ scheme does not mean that the situation of the beneficiary country with respect to the 27 international conventions is fully satisfactory. Instead, it offers the incentive of increased trade access in return for further progress towards the full implementations of those conventions, and provides a platform for engagement with beneficiaries on all problematic areas.
As is the case with all GSP+ countries, the removal of customs duties for Sri Lanka would be accompanied with the rigorous monitoring on the countrys progress in the area of sustainable development, human rights and good governance.

Former NOC president Roy de Silva dies at 80
Former National Olympic Committee chief Roy de Silva passed away on Monday afternoon in his hometown Kandy following a brief illness. Roy who turned 80 on October 8 was a gifted sportsman and promoter and a product of Kandy from a top public school Kingswood College.
Only a handful would remember the role played by officials to uplift sport. If it be so, the name of Roy de Silvas name should never be forgotten in the field of sports and at the National Olympic Committee (NOC) level.
Roy is one of the finest sportsmen to come out of Kingswood College and also Kandy where he excelled at hockey, football, athletics and cricket. Hockey was his pet sport at school and even later. After leaving school, Roy played for Kandy Whites hockey team, and was an automatic choice for the Kandy District and Up-Country teams whenever they played against foreign sides. He also took to hockey umpiring and helped his school in coaching. At one time he was rated as one of the top umpires. Roy also played cricket as a right-arm spinner for Kandy United S.C. along with Dr. C.D.L. Fernando, M.E. Marikar, Bertie Gomes and Mervyn Berenger. He was also a fine cueist and famous in billiards.
Later, Roy took to administration, and was the secretary of the Kandy District Hockey Association for ten years, under the watchful eyes of late M. S. Jainudeen. From Kandy he was elected as the president of the Sri Lanka Hockey Federation, and held the post from 1979 to 1998.

Golden Globes 2017: 'La La Land' breaks record
La La Land" swept Sunday's 74th Golden Globe Awards and set a record.
The musical film -- starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling -- won all seven of the awards for which it received nominations including best motion picture - musical or comedy, best director, best screenplay, best score and acting awards for its stars.Host Jimmy Fallon kicked off the broadcast with a taped sketch that riffed off "La La Land" -- foreshadowing the winning theme of the night.
Fallon's monologue included some political humor -- noting the Globes is "one of the few places left that still honors the popular vote"-- and a small snafu.
"Already the teleprompter is down, so this is a great way to start the show," Fallon said right off the bat.But it was Meryl Streep, who was honored with Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement, that captivated the audience.Streep's "Doubt" costar, Viola Davis, presented the award and praised the actress.
"You make me proud to be an artist," Davis said. "You make me feel that what I have in me, my body, my face, my age, is enough."Streep got political in her speech, highlighting the diversity of the various actors there from around the world.
"Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners and if we kick them all out, you'll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not arts," she said.Without mentioning his name, the actress criticized President-elect Donald Trump for his behavior on the campaign trail -- and called on the press to hold him accountable.
"We need the principled press to hold power to account, to call them on the carpet for every outrage," she said. Streep ended her speech with words of wisdom from her friend, the late Carrie Fisher: "Take your broken heart, make it into art."
The Globes paid tribute to Fisher and her mother Debbie Reynolds, with a video highlighting some of their most memorable film roles.Reynolds died one day after Fisher in December.Davis, who earlier in the night won for best supporting actress in a motion picture for "Fences," thanked her co-star and the film's director, Denzel Washington.
She also paid tribute to her father.
"He had a story, and it deserved to be told and August Wilson told it," Davis said.Casey Affleck and Isabelle Huppert won best actor and actress in the motion picture drama categories for their work in "Manchester by the Sea" and "Elle," respectively.
"Moonlight" was honored as the best motion picture drama -- potentially boosting the coming-of-age film's chances for more success at next month's Academy Awards. In the television categories, FX's "People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story" won for best TV movie/limited series. Sarah Paulson, who portrayed prosecutor Marcia Clark in the series, also picked up a statuette for her work on the show."The Night Manager" scored wins for best actor and supporting actress in a limited series for its stars Hugh Laurie and Olivia Colman.
History was made when Tracee Ellis Ross won for best actress in a musical or comedy TV series. She became the first black woman to win in that category since Debbie Allen won for "Fame" in 1983."This is for all of the women, women of color and colorful people whose stories, ideas, thoughts are not always considered worthy, valid and important," Ross said. "But I want you to know I see you. We see you."Newbie "Atlanta" won for best TV comedy series.The show's creator and star, Donald Glover also won for best actor in a TV comedy.
"This is incredible," Glover said after his show, which has a majority black cast, won. "I really just want to thank Atlanta and all the black folks in Atlanta. For real, just for being alive...and being amazing people."
"The Crown," the acclaimed Netflix series about Queen Elizabeth II, won for best TV drama, with star Claire Foy taking the prize for best actress in a drama.

Government encourages improving quality of human capital
The government encourages and appreciates all institutions dedicated to improve the quality of human capital, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said.
National Human Resources Development Council (NHRDC) under the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry is a leading institute that facilitates and elevates the quality of community life, he said. Amarathunga made these comments at a workshop organised by the NHRDC on Customer Care at the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management yesterday. Customer care training specialist Dammika Kalapuge, addressing the workshop said economic development at the cost of values is not sustainable.
He said religious values, knowledge on history, art, culture and sensitivity to nature is important to develop a personality of an individual.
Kalapuge said, educational qualifications and titles following names will not create an individual with good personality, adding that positive communication and socio-cultural values are foundation for proper customer care.

## Title: He was Kalan to many

He was Kalan to many
The seventies and eighties clearly were tumultuous decades for our cinema. Most commentators, in their rush to inject political relevance to our cultural history, tend to see in them the flowering of a political cinema. True. That does not, however, belittle the other precedents, landmarks, and revolutions which our directors, actors, and scriptwriters wrought. It was in the seventies, for instance, that H. D. Premaratne emerged, and it was in the eighties that, thanks in part to liberalised social and economic policies, an independent cinema here was given birth to. For me, the most significant result of all this was the rise and formation of a different breed of actors: those who not only appealed to the youth, but exemplified it.
Top among these actors, of course, was Vijaya Kumaratunga, whom I wrote on some months ago. Vijaya set a precedent. He was not Gamini Fonseka. He neednt have been. He had an image and that image, at the end of the day, depended on how many conventional, formulaic films he took part in. Those who decry the mans unwillingness to act in off-the-beaten-track ventures, therefore, fail to acknowledge the fact that for our cinema to throw up actors who took to our youth, the precedent-setter (if you will) had to participate in films which, though certainly lacking in critical appeal, reaped dividends at the box-office.
Enough profits
Vijaya came to us in Hanthane Kathawa. He acted opposite Tony Ranasinghe, by then an established star in the mould of Montgomery Clift and James Dean, and (I admit with no hesitation) bested him. But Vijaya was not alone there. He had a co-star. Someone whod go on to symbolise youth in a different, less brash way. His name, Amarasiri Kalansuriya, or Kalan to most.
Before I (try to) examine Kalansuriyas reputation in the context of our cinema, a brief biographical sketch is called for. He was born in Kandy in September 20, 1940 and was educated at Dharmaraja College. His mother died when he was 17, which compelled him to take care of his three younger brothers. He found menial work as a labourer, eventually seeking employment at the Department of Agriculture at Mahiyanganaya, the Air Force (as a lance corporal), and Mallika Studios in his hometown. He left the latter after an argument with his superior, after which (he told me rather candidly when we met) he vowed never to work for anyone again.
This meant, logically enough, that he was his own man. He took to selling clothes. He was able to draw enough profits from these enterprises to set up his own tailor shop, thanks to which he managed to hobnob with several political and cultural figures in his day.
Long before he took to these jobs and before his mother died, though, Kalan had taken to the cinema. Sugathapala Senarath Yapa, on the lookout for aspiring, new actors for his debut, took in the man to act alongside Tony Ranasinghe. Hanthane Kathawa of course is a film that remains as fresh as it would have been back then, a point reinforced by its depiction of campus life. While Kalan had certainly not been to University (at the time he was still in school), he acted with so much sensitivity, wit, and candour that Lester James Peries, again on the lookout for new, aspiring actors, chose him to be Douglas Ranasinghes sidekick in Akkara Paha.
Given his mothers passing away, however, he was forced to move away from films. Remembering this with me, he admitted that he found it difficult to leave behind a tentative career as an actor, but then agreed with me at once when I said that if it wasnt for all those hard, harsh years, he wouldnt have injected conviction into his later roles. That second phase in his career, incidentally, began with Dharmasena Pathiraja and Ahas Gawwa, where the director chose the relatively untried and untested Kalan for the role of the protagonist, opposite Wimal Kumar da Costa.
Scoring films
Pathiraja had his repertory of actors: Vijaya, Wimal, Malani Fonseka, Daya Tennakoon, Cyril Wickremage, and Kalan. Malani of course had been an established box-office star long before Ahas Gawwa, but it was with this politically and socially nuanced debut that all those other names really began their careers. The cinema of Dharmasena Pathiraja is noted for its exuberance, its unabashed lack of regard for uniformity (as opposed to say, the films of Lester James Peries). The narrative sometimes refuses to flow from A to B, it swerves and detours, and in the depiction of its characters, privileges spontaneity over reason. Kalansuriya couldnt have asked for a better comeback.
In my article on Clarence Wijewardena I mentioned that the man couldnt have made a career out of scoring films if it wasnt for H. D. Premaratne. Premaratne was accustomed to taking risks and being emboldened by them. He went as far as to cast relative unknowns and in the process, jumpstart their careers (he did this for Bandula Galagedara, the dwarfish aristocrat in his debut Sikuruliya). To break ground and create a middle-path in our cinema, he resorted to actors as opposed to stars. He was not afraid of trying out new blood, which was how and why he invited Kalansuriya to act as the protagonist in his second feature, Apeksha.
If Sikuruliya gives the promise of an instinct-driven director, Apeksha confirms it. The plots conventional enough, if not simple: a rich girl falls in love with a man from a low social class, only to be engaged against her will to a man who has his sights on another woman. The predictable unfolds: the other man is exposed for who he is, and the girls father, aghast and shocked at his follies, lets the daughter have her way. That final encounter atop a hill, where Kalan (the hero) and his friend (Robin Fernando) fight the antagonist, could have been taken from a standard American flick, and the resolution of the plots conflict would have left audiences and critics happy in a way which drew both audiences and accolade. Much of this, no doubt, had to do with Kalansuriyas acting.
While Sikuruliya and Apeksha conceded ground to the tropes of commercial cinema (with Kalan as the poor hero, Malani as the estranged heiress, and Ranjan Mendis as the rich antagonist), Premaratnes next film was of a different mould. Parithyagaya, which examined the issue of poverty, class, and the dowry system, paired Kalan with Sriyani Amarasena and Vasanthi Chathurani. His earlier work had a refreshing pop quality to them (no doubt owing to Clarence Wijewardenes music). Parithyagaya (which got Premaratne working with Premasiri Khemadasa) signifies a break from this trend, the beginning of a new middle cinema in the country. It boosted Kalansuriyas image as an idealist beset with misfortune in his youth, which he retained throughout the eighties.
Youthful idealist
Speaking for myself, I dont think that image ever left him. You see it crop up in every part he took. While the likes of Vijaya Kumaratunga matured, and I daresay hardened, Kalan remained the youthful idealist he would have been in real life. Parithyagaya, to give an example, opens with a sequence of the man riding his bicycle to the city: he rides it, stops it to check the wheels, clutches at a moving truck, and daringly takes his hands away from the handlebars for a moment or two.
The opening sequence is crucial, though superficially extraneous, in establishing him as a strongman beset and cut down by social circumstances later on: when he steals money to get his sister the dowry she needs for her lovers family to agree to her proposal, he is both daring and frail: a composite of opposites signifying the inner turmoil and self-contradictions his characters, in their quest to help others, bred and embodied. He doesnt particularly do a good job of stealing the money, moreover: in that final scene, after his sister is finally married, when he imagines hes marrying his fiance (Chathurani) atop the poruwa and is disturbed by the intrusion of the police, he almost looks relieved in a defeatist kind of way: its as though hes been expecting the police to come all along, as though it were a moment of reckoning for him.
I think this was the Kalan we grew up loving and (to a point) emulating. You never really had much hope for his protagonists (the man was unable to play antagonists, I like to believe), but that didnt stop you from offering sympathy for them. The earlier Kalan was a sidekick, someone who, at most, offered balm to his co-star (think of Douglas Ranasinghe from Akkara Paha or Tony Ranasinghe from Hanthane Kathawa). The Kalan of the eighties was a different player. Being an instinct-driven actor, he found his niche with instinct-driven directors. He didnt take part in a great many films (a pity at one level, a blessing at another) but in the few he was in, he brought home the point he wanted to make with his characters.
I met Amarasiri Kalansuriya the other day and I saw someone Id seen many, many, many years ago. He remains the young idealist he always was. More pertinently, he remains young. Hasnt really aged. Brash, candid, and honest, he has combined his youthfulness with a sense of humility and humanity that has, I fervently believe, aided him over most of lifes rough terrains. He hasnt still finished his rounds, I suspect.

Internet of Things: An enabler for business growth
From smart cars that are able to drive and park themselves, intelligent thermostats that detect your arrival and turn up the heat, to smart clothing that can track the amount of calories burnt,these are all part of the latest gadgets-gone-gaga trend: the Internet of Things (IoT).
Simply put, a thing, in the Internet of Things can be any natural or man-made object with an IP address and has the ability to collect, analyze and transfer data over a network without human intervention.
The concept of IoT dates all the way back to the early 1980s when a Coca-Cola machine at Carnegie Mellon University in the U.S. was modified to become an internet-connected appliance that could measure and report, without human intervention,whether or not the drinks were cold. However, it is only now that IoT is gaining significant relevance and traction driven by the declining cost of sensors, increased connectivity and enhanced data processing power.
Is it catching on in the Asian region
While estimates projected by multiple industry experts vary drastically, forecasters agree on one thing,IoT will see remarkable growth in the next few years. Experts estimate global growth to jump from 6-14 billion autonomous things in 2014 to 18-50 billion things by 2020, while the revenue opportunity of IoT is forecasted to be between $1 trillion to $7 trillion by 2020. These estimates reflect IoTs capacity to transform both consumer and business applications in the near future.
According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region is set to become the frontline for IoT with an estimated 10 billion things connected, creating a market opportunity of over $2.6 trillion by 2020. Smart Cities government initiatives implemented by countries like India, Singapore, Malaysia, China and Indonesia, are driving the demand for IoT solutions that can reduce costs and enhance citizen services.
While government initiatives are expected to lead the IoT sector, private investments in IoT within utilities, healthcare, retail and discrete manufacturing are also likely to see high growth. For instance, healthcare smart applications like wearable devices, remote patient monitoring and clinical trial applications are revolutionizing and improving the healthcare space in India, where the doctor to patient ratio is lower than the limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Have IoT investments really been successful
Innovation-hungry companies across various sectors are capitalizing on IoT opportunities. In fact, industry experts believe that by 2025, organizations that extensively invest and incorporate IoT technologies in their products and operations will be at least 10% more profitable than competitors that dont.
Last year, IBMs announcement of a $3 billion investment in a new IoT business unit and General Electrics announcement that the company made $6 billion through their industrial IoT products further proved IoTs revenue potential. Companies in the APAC region have been following suit.
For example, XL Axiata, an Indonesian telecom operator,launched a separate IoT division that offers innovative IoT products and solutions. Savvy, a smart home solution, was launched by this division in February 2016 and has recorded over 360,000 registered connections after the first three months.
The burgeoning IoT sector is also having a significant impact on the APAC startup ecosystem, with an increasing number of IoT startups receiving funding from both global and local investors. In October 2015, Qualcomm Ventures and Norwest Venture Partners invested $10 million in Chennai-based Attune Technologies, a cloud-based software provider that connects devices such as Intensive Care Unit (ICU) machines and lab analyzers to the health network.
Moreover, some IoT-based startups are exhibiting impressive top line growth. Covacsis Technology,an Indian IoT startup focused on manufacturing plant optimization and backed by investors such as Cisco Systems,is seeing top line growth of 300 to 400% and targets to reach $15 million in revenues this year. Although the company was founded just seven years ago, the IoT solution is now being used by 25 of the top 100 manufacturing companies in India.
What is the future of IoT in Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka is certainly not far behind this revolutionary charge. Several government initiatives aimed at capturing the full potential of IoT, big data and cloud computing to empower key public sectors including education, healthcare, urban development and finance have already been commissioned. This is evident with conceptual projects like Megapolis Smart Cities that involve the implementation of real-time traffic information systems, smart power grids and smart street lighting.
Sri Lanka has also stepped into the utilities segmentthe Ministry of Power and Energy launched a smart meter system earlier this year to the business community. These smart meter systems have the ability to track, monitor, and report granular utility usage data without any human intervention.
This concept not only enables the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to reduce its peak power generation charges by pushing consumers to shift electricity use to off-peak hours, but also helps replace the costly, traditional model that requires regular home visits to read meters.
Sri Lanka has long been recognised as a regional leader in terms of connectivity, innovation and incubation,as proven when Sri Lanka was the first country in South Asia to introduce commercial 4G services in 2014.
Sri Lanka also boasts a mobile penetration of over 100% with the market rapidly shifting towards the Smartphone segment. Given that IoT solutions primarily rely on Smartphone use and connectivity, there is substantial runway for growth and adoption of IoT solutions in Sri Lanka. What can this mean for your business
As IoT adoption becomes a reality, Sri Lankan businesses must explore the relevance of IoT to their products and services and how they can best capitalise on potential opportunities in the space. In order to enter the space and reap quick returns, it is critical for firms to make fact-based, informed decisions based on a clear understanding of not just market nuances and complexities, but also an honest assessment of in-house assets and capabilities.

Legal action against police for Htoa incidents: G.L.
Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna President and former External Affairs Minister Professor G.L. Peiris yesterday said that legal action would be taken against the police for dispersing a peaceful protest in Hambantota by using tear gas and water canons.
He was addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday.
He said over 2,000 STF personnel with police had been deployed to disperse a peaceful protest by the people of Hambantaota against the proposed acquisition of their lands by the authorities for the establishment of an Industrial Zone.
The Inspector General of Police who was among the police officers present were seen giving orders to attack the Buddhist monks who participated in the peaceful protest, he said.
Peiris said the police should take the responsibility for disrupting public life by unleashing violence. The former minister said he has already held discussions with senior lawyers to institute legal action against the police.
The IGP is at the beck and call of the Prime Minister. He is willing to do anything to win the confidence of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, he said. Professor Peris said the IGPs conduct has brought disrepute to the department.
The Chairman of the National Police Commission has already tendered his resignation and the Commission has failed to take any action against the IGP, he said.

Linea Aqua Hanwella obtains world  first with WaterNeutral Certification
Linea Aqua announced its latest landmark accomplishment in environmental sustainability obtaining the WaterNeutral Certification for its Hanwella factory, making it the first apparel manufacturing facility in the world to have achieved this status.
Water Neutrality is a novel concept first coined by the Water Footprint Network of the Netherlands - a non-profit, multi-stakeholder, global organisation, in collaboration with the University of Twente, which was further customised by The Sustainable Future Group (SFG) taking into account other published global concepts in developing its WaterNeutral certification.
The theory behind it is based on achieving the maximum, reasonably possible reduction of a business entity's fresh water consumption by means of reusing and recycling water.
Another important requirement of this certification is the reasonable, responsible and effective investment(s) into projects aimed toward improving sustainable and equitable use of water. Commenting on the historic occasion at the handover ceremony, Linea Aqua outgoing CEO and Managing Director Sarinda Unamboowe who initiated the project said Linea Aqua has always placed sustainability at the forefront of its business operations and this latest initiative is no different. "We pledge to become the first-ever WaterNeutral apparel manufacturer in the world, and we hope that our efforts towards reducing our operational Water Footprint would set a precedent within the industry.
CCC CEO Sanith De S Wijeyeratne said, Water is a precious natural resource that is in abundance in Sri Lanka, but we don't give much thought about its conservation. It is heartening to see companies like Linea Aqua take the initiative towards measuring and minimising the impact of their operations on our water table. I hope that other companies will follow suit and help us safeguard one of the most vital resources we have been blessed with.
This significant achievement of Linea Aqua further showcases the company's commitment towards becoming a more sustainable business entity in Sri Lanka.

Look up your dictionary
The dictionary is synonymous with student life. A successful student career is unimaginable sans a good dictionary. In other words, a dictionary is a must for a student. In fact, the dictionary propels the learning process of the learner. The dictionary has brought forth many a scholar to the society. It has rendered a yeoman service for the uplift of the intellectual capacity of man.
In this light, the dictionary deserves the intellectuals encomium for putting them on a high pedestal on their journey of success. It has been highly instrumental for their upward mobility in intellectual development. As the first term of the academic year 2017 unfurls before the students, it seems our bounden duty to inject new vigour to the students enthusiasm to use the dictionary to reap its many a benefit for the progress march of the nation.
All of us have to open the eyes of the prodigy to enable them to unlock their own potentials. In a profound analysis, the dictionary is a whetstone for them to sharpen their innate talents.
Using the dictionary at the young age prepares the necessary springboard for them to reach the zenith in their future spheres of life. No one has developed his linguistics skills without the dictionary.
The dictionary is the gateway to a vast treasure house of knowledge. The tragedy is that most of the students seem to have deviated from this reliable source of knowledge to their own detriment. The teacher has an unwritten duty to guide the tender children towards this direction that would yield many a positive result on their long journey of academic excellence.
A careful learner could gather an ocean of words from a good standard dictionary such as The Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary of Current English, Cambridge Advanced Learners Dictionary, Collins Dictionary and our own Malalasekara English Sinhala Dictionary. In addition to these dictionaries, it is advisable to be in constant touch with a standard thesaurus if a learner gets into the habit of making references to these invaluable guides in their learning process, the sky is the limit for them.
It is very poignant to note here that even most of the teachers of English have not cultivated this habit, let alone other subject teachers at their own mercy. This aspect is of paramount importance because language is a very volatile field and new words enter the dictionary very frequently, aiyo, you are too late to begin.
Not only new words, but also new types of English emerge making it an unending race for the learners to keep pace with. The growth of internet use is behind it .The multiple ways of using dictionaries in this day and age is unto the reader.
The dictionary is popularly used as a very effective tool of learning. It is mostly used for checking meaning and spelling.
Yet, an enthusiastic learner like the writer can get a lot more from a dictionary. The modern dictionaries are veritably efficient teachers than most of the teachers that you find in the normal school classrooms. The English vocabulary profile that you find in any new dictionary could be your constant guide.
You could find sure answers for the problems of word meanings, phrases, idioms, parts of speech, figurative use, literal and literary meaning, the proverbs related to the words, whether the word is given in taboo or it is derogatory, how the word is used formally and informally, how to use it in spoken English, the origin of the word and many more. It is said that necessity is the mother of invention, the necessity of a dictionary was first felt by Samuel Johnson and his little effort has now gone a long way.
In most of the dictionaries common mistakes of using words are given in a box. Even an advanced learner could refer to them and revise their knowledge very easily. They are given in a box for easy reference. The compilers of modern dictionaries take the learners dictionaries a list of irregular is given with surgical accuracy.
The geographical names given after the word meanings expand our knowledge. Many varieties of English are invading the print and electronic media in an unprecedented manner. In order to equip the learner the dictionaries give major pronunciation styles in easy to understand ways. Phonetic symbols are made easy in dictionaries.
The publishers of this priceless facilitator deserve our encomium for undertaking such a gigantic task and performing it with zero error in their noble duty towards mankind.
A learner-friendly dictionary is a trusted guide. The writers personal experience is that the educational wealth found in a dictionary is a fat dowry to a learner.
The sentences given as examples to illustrate the words are informative and educative. Total immersion in the dictionary catapults ones knowledge into dizzy heights.
Reading the dictionary is a time tested method that could be introduced to the learners without hesitation.
The apparent enthusiasm among young children to learn good English deserves to be emulated in order to groom them to the future language requirements of the country.
The good name earned by our scholars for our country ought to be preserved. Queens lingo should be given pride of place in the national curriculum.
Apart from the mother dictionary, in furtherance of the dictionary skills, Dictionary Punctuation And Hyphernation, Spelling Dictionary, Dictionary of Literary Terms would serve as a catalyst in this experiment. If you would like to take a leaf from the writers experience, take your mind off to think that I have read the dictionary five times in toto, it is to have the fun of it.
Reading makes a full man
Conference a ready man
Writing an exact man
Virtue is like a rich-stoned best plane set.
Creative reading of the dictionary loads you with all the rudiments for intellectual pursuits.
Be at ready wits by reading the dictionary. Lets make it a New Year resolution and promote the notion for the forward march of the prodigious posterity.

Lust for peace
May I share my thoughts with my dear readers on a word that brings joy, hope, faith and love mingled with a lot of tears. It is the most beautiful word sought so much by humans, animals and plants between the beginning and the end of their existence.
Peace, Samaya, Samadanam is a word that has been with us from birth to death, and exists in all the languages of the world. A most sought after word. The white feathered dove has been the symbol of peace from time immemorial. The dreaded tentacles of pride, greed, anger, jealousy, lust, war and politics have always strived to strangle peace. To man, peace is the ultimate consolation in overcoming the tears and desolation caused by them and bequeaths to man an abundance of tears of thanksgiving and tranquillity. Peace is a state of harmony that exists between individuals, families, neighbours, ethnic groups and countries. At times we make peace with our lovely innocent animals. Peace of mind, peaceful environment, peaceful demonstrations, passing away peacefully. When the Red Indians wanted to have peace, they threw their tomahawks away and smoked the pipe of peace. Peace can be easily broken.
Of all the happenings, opposing peace, the most dreaded is war. Peace is made to shudder and cry. War of words, thoughts of revenge could culminate in a vale of tears. War is the precursor of hunger, despondency and loss of life. History has shown us how nations have been sliced to pieces until peace steps in. Breaches of peace cause man, animal and plant to embrace Mother Earth in death. It is only the victims of war who as the limbless citizens of a nation, orphans and refugees who walks, walk and walk to unknown lands carrying their starving children who cry and pray for peace.
It is not those who light crackers and parade on the streets who understand the meaning of real peace. Its the unfortunate persons who have been bitten by the dogs of war and have been eye witnesses of their loved ones and friends being blown up to bits who will accept peace with bowed heads, smiles and tears. The lives of persons who lived in peace can be torn asunder by interested persons. Hidden agendas of a few make peaceful humans to go berserk while some shed crocodile tears. Politics, lust for power make peace to cry.
It happened in our gem of an island. A country universally excepted as a hospitable nation with smiling people was shattered.
A nation prayed for peace. A joyous, nation, sighed in relief when peace dawned. Here, we cannot ever forget our beloved combatants who made peace to bloom once again. Millions of voices were raised in prayer to all the Beautiful Teachers in whom we believed. All prayed for peace. All of them granted our wish. In our own little gem living water played a vital vote in bringing us peace. Our sagacious monarchs of old gave their subjects water to irrigate, bathe and to drink and live in contentment and peace. Again it was water that was to give us peace, when the gates of Mawilaru sluices were opened, and quenched a parched part of our Mother Lanka with water and peace.
The league of Nations and the United Nations were founded to remove the stench of war from the face of the earth.

Man gives up guarding durian due to wifes frolics
With the Durian season now on, residents in the Kuruwita area who are in for a windfall now make it a point to guard their Durian trees at night to protect their impending fruit harvest from robbers.
But a resident in Kuruwita who put a watch hut near his tree, had to give up his night vigil and guard his house due to the sexual frolics of his wife who had developed an intimacy with another man in the neighbourhood whom she invited to the house at night during the absence of her husband.
The womans brother-in-law who had observed the ins and outs of the paramour in the absence of the husband had alerted the husband about the latest development.
One night, the husband who thought of catching the night intruder red handed, had returned home from the watch hut accompanied by his brother.
They had seen the intruder fleeing from the backdoor sensing their arrival.
The husband had berated the wife and started assaulting her, but the brother-n-law had quickly intervened and settled the matter creating reconciliation between the two.

Mexico will negotiate with Trump without fear
MEXICO: Mexicos new foreign minister vowed on Monday that his country will negotiate with US President-elect Donald Trumps administration without fear.
President Enrique Pena Nieto brought former finance minister Luis Videgaray back to his cabinet last week to seek constructive relations with Trump, who has vowed to upend trade ties with Mexico.
Videgaray had resigned as finance minister in September, a week after it was revealed that he orchestrated a much-criticized pre-election meeting between Trump and Pena Nieto in Mexico City.
We will negotiate with great confidence in ourselves, without fear, knowing how important Mexico is for the United States in economic, social and political terms, Videgaray said at a meeting with Mexican ambassadors.
Trump has angered Mexicans with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and his vow to make the neighboring country pay for a giant wall along their border.
The Republican billionaire, who takes office on January 20, has also caused the peso to plunge as investors fret over his plan to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada.
He has also pledged to slap import tariffs of as much as 35 percent on companies that ship jobs abroad.
Trump made similar threats to US auto-maker General Motors and Japans Toyota last week for making cars in Mexico, while Ford announced the cancellation of a new $1.6 billion factory in the neighboring country.
Despite concerns about Trumps protectionist policies, exports of Mexican-made cars to the United States rose by 9.6 percent in December compared to the same month in 2015, according to the Mexican Automobile Industry Association (AMIA). Trump was elected on November 8.
AMIA president Eduardo Solis said the United States would have to withdraw from NAFTA in order to impose tariffs because the pacts rules keep such import taxes for cars at zero percent. The Mexican government could also take legal action at the World Trade Organization if tariffs of more than 2.5 percent are imposed on light vehicles and 25 percent on pickup trucks, Solis said.
The five biggest exporters of Mexican-made cars by volume in 2016 were GM, Nissan, Fiat Chrysler, Ford and Volkswagen, while Toyota was eighth

Misunderstanding led to Hambantota unrest  Shantha Bandara
The lack of knowledge of the people on the agreements of the Hambantota projects led to the unrest, said the President of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Youth Front, Shantha Bandara.
He said although development programmes in Hambantota were commendable, lack of knowledge of the clergy and civilians regarding the projects and agreements, led to such a situation. He added that not only the Buddhist priests but civilians too have the right to understand what was taking place. "We dont like anyone harassing the saffron robe," said Bandara.
He made these observations yesterday during a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) headquarters organised by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Youth Front.
The mistake of the government was that there was no clear indication of the extent of land to be acquired. There were different statements made by different parties. "When the youth front of the SLFP inquired from President Maithripala Sirisena, he said that he would not allow the acquisition of land that would inconvenience the public.
"The proper way to decide on land acquisition was through discussions at the Regional Coordinating Committees and District Coordinating Committees where all regional and district level officials meet and also with religious representatives and civilians," Bandara said.
"If it happened that way there would not have been any issue," he said.
He said when the Hambantota harbour and the airport were constructed during the previous regime, the industrial zone was to be set up and it was in the plan. The same was told to the people and the same plan is now being implemented.
He requested Joint Opposition members to unite with the SLFP even if they don't agree with the Unity government. He added that they should rally around the SLFP.

New tunnel from Getambe to Tennekumbura: Answer to Kandy traffic congestion
A new tunnel will be constructed from Getambe to Tennekumbura to ease traffic congestion in Kandy, said Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
Past rulers never gave highway contracts to domestic companies. This is the first time that a domestic company has been awarded a highway construction contract, he said.
Kiriella said when he was the Kandy district chief organiser in 1989, he received requests regarding the Halloluwa Bridge.
The first foundation stone to build this bridge was laid by Deputy Minister Hemachandra Sirisena during the 1960-65 Sri Lanka Freedom Party government rule. But construction came to a halt over the years, he said.
The minister made these comments at the opening ceremony of the new Dodamwala and Halloluwa Bridge. It was built over the Mahaweli River by the Road Development Authority under the UK Steel Bridge Project.
The 105 metre bridge was built at a cost of Rs. 374 million.
The unity government has commenced many projects in Kandy. Construction from Kadawatha to Meerigama for the Central Expressway has begun, and the section from Meerigama to Kurunegala has been awarded to a local contractor for the first time in history, Kirella said.
President Maithripala Sirisena, Post, Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Minister M.H.A. Haleem, British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka James Dauris, MPs Mayantha Dissanayaka, Lucky Jayawardana, Ananda Aluthgamage, provincial ministers and residents participated.

A new way to punish young cybercriminals
Cybercriminals do stuff online, so punish them by taking away their internet access. Its as simple as taking a crowbar from a burglar. Or is it Some outside-the-box thinking by a top cop this week has triggered a debate among cybersecurity types about young offending and punishment.
Ch Supt Gavin Thomas, the president of the Police Superintendents Association of England and Wales, suggested in an interview that wifi jammers  devices worn on the ankle or wrist to block the internet  could serve as a smarter punishment for cybercrimes than prison. We have got to stop using 19th-century punishments to deal with 21st-century crimes, he said.
Few would dispute that, but there are some issues with jammers. First, they are illegal under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006, so wed need to work on that. Second, they wouldnt work.
Although we desperately need alternatives to prison, using wifi jammers is both technically infeasible and unreliable, says Cal Leeming, who went to prison for hacking as a teenager and is now a security consultant. Even if you did manage to implement it without breaking nearby connectivity, which in itself would be very difficult because of how radio works, it could be easily circumvented by using a cable.
Darren Martyn, an Irish convicted hacker turned security researcher (he was part of the LulzSec group), adds: This would cause huge disruption to anyone within jamming range of the tagged person.
Legal and technical hurdles notwithstanding, would an enforced screen break  a digital grounding of the sort increasingly issued by parents  help solve the broader problem Prof Mary Aiken, a cyber-psychologist at University College Dublin, is sceptical. If the criminal justice system is struggling to keep pace with tech, the lag in education is the graver threat, she says. It is going to be very difficult if not impossible to prosecute our way out of problems such as youth hacking, she explains. What is required is a fundamental re-evaluation of the impact of technology on developing youth.
In Youth Pathways into Cybercrime (pdf), a report published in October by Middlesex University, Aiken and her colleagues recommend not thwarting the digital skills of these young people, but giving them safer outlets.
Jessica Barker, a cybersecurity consultant who runs the cyber.uk website, agrees. She cites research by Sonia Livingstone, who leads the Parenting for a Digital Future research project at the London School of Economics. It suggests that denying screen time or web access can be counterproductive, whether were talking about naughty kids or young criminals. Children who are blocked access are more likely to engage in risky behaviour because they will find another way to access the internet that is unsupervised, Barker says.

Obama Farewell: Democracy needs you, says outgoing president

President Barack Obama has called on Americans to defend their democracy in his farewell speech in Chicago.
"By almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place" than it was eight years ago when he took office, he told thousands of supporters.
But he warned "democracy is threatened whenever we take it for granted".
He implored Americans of all backgrounds to consider things from each other's point of view, saying "we have to pay attention and listen".
The country's first black president, now 55, was first elected in 2008 on a message of hope and change.
His successor, Donald Trump, has vowed to undo some of Obama's signature policies. He will be sworn into office on January 20.
Raucous chants of "four more years" from the crowd were brushed aside by the president. "I can't do that," he said with a smile. US presidents are limited to two terms by the constitution.
"No, no, no, no no," he said, when the crowd booed the prospect of Trump replacing him.
Striking an upbeat tone, Obama said that the peaceful transfer of power between presidents was a "hallmark" of American democracy.
But, he outlined three threats to American democracy - economic inequality, racial divisions and the retreat of different segments of society into "bubbles", where opinions are not based on "some common baseline of facts".
"If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the internet, try to talk with one in real life," he said to laughter and applause.
In his closing remarks he said he had one final request for Americans as president: "I am asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change - but in yours."
Returning to Chicago, where he first declared victory in 2008, Obama delivered a mostly positive message to Americans after a divisive election campaign which saw to Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Obama said that young Americans - including those who worked on his campaigns, and who believe "in a fair, just, inclusive America" - left him feeling "even more optimistic about this country than I was when we started".
In choosing Chicago, Obama had earlier said he wanted to return to "where it all started" for him and First Lady Michelle Obama, instead of delivering the speech from the White House.

Perched on a huge cactus
Before the arrival of Spanish conquistadors to the regions of Mesoamerica the indigenous civilizations of Olmec, the Mayas and the Aztecs made Empires of different identities. Mesoamerica expanded covering a vast area from the Central Mexico to Belize, Gautamala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Northern Costa Rica.
Mesoamerica was a region of contrasting landscapes and rich in diversity of topographical features such as snowcapped volcanoes , swamps and lowland jungles. Well-irrigated Valley of Mexico covering an area of 800,000 hectares ( two million acres) is in the Southern part of Mexico.
Tenochtitlan believed as the founder of Aztecs was known by Nahuatl, Aztecs, Mexica, and Tenochcas - the mysterious Island City of Cranes. According to the chronicler Hernando Alvarado de Tezozomoc this tribe of Mesoamerica was known as Aztecs because of their place of origin the mysterious island city of Axtlan having the meaning of White Land or the Land of Cranes.
Under the guidance of the Huitzilopochtli the Tribal God of Aztecs, they ventured on a hazardous migration across the northern landscapes before they embarked on the location destined to found their capital.
Another version of mythology based on the founding of the location of the Aztecs capital was the vision of an eagle perched on a huge cactus eating a writhing serpent on lake Texcoco. The name Mexica was given on the wandering tribes by their Patron God- Huitzilopochtli. Just like all the religious beliefs of rest of the other tribes found scattered in the various regions of Mesoamerica there were similar traits even in the belief systems and cult practices of Aztecs. According to research scholars on Aztec Civilization , there were almost 200 Gods and Goddesses in charge of supervising different aspects of the Universe.
Huitzilopochtli was the Patron God of Aztecs. It was he who gave instructions to the wandering Aztecs where to establish the Capital City of their Civilization.
Tlaloc was the God in charge of rain and also considered as one of the most ancient gods in Mesoamerica. Tlaloc was associated agricultural fertility and this Fertility Gods origin could be traced back to the Olmec and Maya Civilizations. Human sacrifice and feasting on the flesh of the victim were well known religious traditions across the civilizations in Mesoamerica including the Aztec civilization. Sacrificial human victims breast was cut open and the heart was removed during Aztec religious festivities.
Blue band had been used to decorate Tlalocs shrine symbolically indicating rain and water. During the cult ceremonies conducted in honour of God Tlaloc, new-born children had been sacrificed because the Aztecs believed that the tears could satisfy Tlaloc.
Tonatiuh was the Sun God of the Aztecs responsible in providing warmth and fertility to the human beings. The Aztecs believed that the god was in need of sacrificial blood of the human beings in order to provide warmth and fertility.
Tlalaltlecuhtli was Aztecs Earth Goddess and in order to propitiate this monstrous Aztec Goddess several human sacrifices had to be made. Xipe Totec was the Aztec God of Agriculture and Fertility. A human skin was worn by him symbolizing the death of the old and growth of vegetation. Quetzalcoatl was the most famous Aztec god venerated by numerous tribes belonged to many civilizations across Mesoamerica.
In 1428, Tenochtitlan, Texcoco and Tlacopan formed an alliance and Aztec Empire became a confederation. Referring to appearance of the comet, Friar Bernardino de Sahagun, the Author of General History of the Things of New Spain had mentioned, that the comet thrust into the sky just having the appearance of a flame and had spilled a rain of fiery drops as it had broken the canopy of the heavens. The shamen, nor the astronomers could interpret this omen.
The ruler of Texcocan, Netzahualpilli renown in the prediction of future events, said the destruction of the Aztec empire. Long before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in Mexico, in 1519, there were rumors spreading about the European visitors.
In the year 1492, the Spanish conquistadors landed in the West Indies and left their marks in Hispaniola, Cuba, Venezuela, and Panama. Seeing large Spanish ships, in 1518, a labourer came to the Imperial Court that he had seen mountains floating in the sea.
The last Aztec leader Moctezuma 11, discovered that men having long beards and fair skin had arrived in floating mountains. Cortes was hesitant whether to treat the strange visitors as Gods or the invaders. According to the tradition of the Aztecs, Moctezuma sent tokens of friendship comprised of large discs of gold and silver representing the Sun and the Moon , ritual costumes and some food ceremonially blended with human blood obtained from a sacrificial victim.
The Spanish Conquistador Hernan Cortes refused to accept the gifts sent to him.
After realizing the mission of Cortes that he had arrived as an invader, Moctezuma obtained the services of the sorcerers to cast spells preventing the movements of Hernan Cortes and his band of the Spanish conquistadors.
Hernan Cortes was not affected by the spells of the sorcerers and the Spanish invaders led by Cortes proceeded towards the imperial capital. Moctezuma conspired to kill the Spaniards but it was revealed in advance. Moctezuma came on a palanquin to meet Cortes and greeted the Spaniards with great respect and gave a gift of a necklace of snail shells and shrimp fashioned in solid Gold and Cortes in return presented a string of Vanetian Glass beads. Moctezuma invited Hernan Cortes and his Spanish followers to the Capital City of Aztecs.
On the arrival of the Spaniards in Aztec Capital, they were kept in the palace of Axayacatl in close proximity to a Aztec Ritual Enclosure. Taken into consideration the previous attempt to kill them, the Spaniards imprisoned the Aztec Emperor Moctezuma.
As Hernan Cortes without consulting the governor of Cuba went beyond his mission of expedition a Spanish force was sent to arrest Cortes. Cortes could defeat them and requested the remaining Spanish warriors to return to Aztecs Capital under his command. The Spaniards attacked the Aztecs and Moctezuma was made to climb to the roof of the palace to calm down Aztec warriors.
After several wars between the Aztecs and the Spaniards, on 13th August, 1521 the Aztec Empire was completely captured by Hernan Cortes.

Ports Authority should control Hambantota industrial zone and harbour - MR
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa issuing a statement yesterday said that the agreement negotiated by the government during his tenure with both China Harbour Co and China Merchant Co to manage the Hambantota container terminal for 40 years was the best deal yet.
Rajapaksa said as a matter of principle, he was against the leasing of the harbour for 99 years and giving the rights of the land in the industrial zone to a foreign private company.
The industrial zone and the harbour should be controlled by the Ports Authority, while harbour operations may be given on management contracts to the private sector. For example, the Colombo port is run by the Ports Authority and two private operators. The Ports Authority has full control over the Colombo harbour as well as equity in the two privately run terminals.
This should be the approach to the Hambantota port as well, he added.
Rajapaksa said the loans taken for the construction of this harbour were US $ 450 million for the first phase, US $ 70 million for the bunkering facility and US $ 802 million for the second phase bringing the total to around US $ 1,322 million.
When complete the harbour would have four terminals and 12 berths. This was meant to be a free port covering an area of 2,000 hectares where goods could be manufactured or value added and shipped overseas. Feasibility studies were made before these loans were taken and the annual interest plus capital repayments would amount to about US $ 111 million. My government had planned to raise that money through the Ports Authority, he added.
Rajapaksa noted that the first phase of the Hambantota harbour became partially operational in 2011 and the transhipment of vehicles began in 2012 with 70 percent of the vehicles coming into Hambantota being transhipped to other countries. In 2014, 335 vessels called at the Hambantota harbour with 295 in 2015. The port made an operating profit of Rs. 900 million in 2014 and Rs 1.2 billion in 2015. These are investments that last centuries and a new harbour cannot be expected to produce large profits in the first few years. Our plan was to break even within 10 years, he stated.

Premier took on challenge to bring in investors - Gayantha
Opening a huge company such as ATG Hand Care (Pvt) Ltd which will provide a large number of jobs to the youth in the South was a most welcome move, said Gayantha Karunathilake, Minister of Mass Media and Parliamentary Reforms in Koggala recently.
Sri Lanka from ancient times had built a huge reputation as a trading hub. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe when assumed office had to face a daunting task because the former regime had mismanaged the economy opening several white elephant projects securing huge loans for exorbitant interest rates. Due to this the country was facing a huge financial crisis, Minister Karunathilake said.
But the Premier had taken the challenge to form a government at this difficult juncture and from 2017 onwards bring in investments, open factories around the country and generate employment opportunities and open income avenues to the masses of the country. Fulfilling the promises after the dawn of 2017 within a few days, in a time span of one to one and a half weeks the Premier has brought in investments that will generate over 20,000 jobs in the country, the minister said.
Last week in Giriulla a factory that would provide 3,000 job opportunities was launched. In Kuliyapitiya the work of a massive car assembly plant was inaugurated by the Prime Minister and in Horana, the premier broke ground for a huge tyre manufacturing plant and today by opening this factory in the South had made it a reality to the people in the area. The Prime Minister has also taken the responsibility to revive a huge number white elephant projects in Hambantota, Karunathilake said.
The minister recalled as to how President J. R. Jayewardene took the challenge to build the Mahaweli Project which had been talked about since the 60s by various governments. Jayewardene took grants and very concessionary loans and completed the accelerated project in six years. The burden of those projects was not passed onto the public, he said.
ATGs MaxiFlex worlds number one glove - Fazal
Fazal Abdeen, Joint Managing Director ATG Group said he and members of the Katunayake Free Trades Zone Manufacturers' Association very much appreciated the governments endeavour to bring in investments to the country and create one million jobs .
It was also a great pleasure that they were able to contribute to the governments endeavour of creating one million jobs by providing employment opportunities from their Koggala and Wathupitiwala factories, he said addressing the open ceremony of the US$ 50 million ATG Hand Care Pvt Ltd factory in Koggala. ATG opened in 1992 with about 25 employees. Today they were able to provide employment to more than 4,500 people, he said.
Abdeen said among the gloves they produce what took centre stage was the world renowned MaxiFlex brand which they hold the patent rights.

Abdeen added that they intend to make more investments in Sri Lanka in the future.

President cannot hold referendum on Constitution - SB
The SLFP or President Maithripala Sirisena does not have the mandate to hold a referendum on a Constitution, Minister S.B. Dissanayake said.
Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake was speaking at a media briefing at Sethsiripaya, Battaramulla yesterday.
The SLFP did not seek a mandate for such an amendment that requires a referendum, Minister Dissanayake said.
The UNP sought a popular vote for a constitution, which they did not get, he said.
"If we want to change the Constitution, we will have to exercise a choice that does not insist on a referendum," he said.
Minister Dissanayake said that the SLFP is not against constitutional amendments that would encourage the reconciliation process and fulfill the needs of ethnic minorities.
"We will support if there are amendments regarding Presidential powers as well, he said.
Speaking on the report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms, he said that it is timely that such a study took place.
"No Constitution was created with the participation of all communities in Sri Lanka. Former President Chandrika Bandaranayake attempted to graft a Constitution, but it did not turn to a reality," Dissanayake said.
Speaking on the provincial council election, Minister Dissanayake said delimitation reports will be gazetted soon. The election will be held by April 15.
The UNP and the SLFP have agreed to hold the election following the first past the post system instead of the preferential voting system, he said.
Minister Dissanayake said while the SLFP is proposing President Maithripala Sirisena to run for the presidency in 2020, the UNP will go ahead with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as their Presidential candidate.
President Sirisena is still not voicing his idea on this proposal for the 2020 presidential election, but as the leader of SLFP, he is bound to go with the popular vote, Minister Dissanayake said.

The project was launched following a proposal by Budget 2017.The project will be implemented under the initiative of President Maithripala Sirisena's Beginning of third Year of a Sustainable Era, and the Prime Minister's concept to build a powerful Sri Lanka under his Economic Policy Statement.
The first solar power generating scheme under this project was fixed in the Finance Ministry building.Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake inaugurated the project.
Minister Karunanayake said converting current expensive power sources into new energy sources through conserving environment is a turning point of the ongoing rapid development agenda. He pointed out that introducing solar power will help the government to manage its cost factor specially in repaying the existing colossal debts.
He said the Finance Ministry expects to cut its monthly electricity bill by Rs.200,000 accordingly.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake further said: A huge amount of debt had borrowed haphazardly when we took over the government on January 8, 2015. As a government, we found two methods to come out from this colossal debt trap. One is to leave them as they were and continue our activities.
The second remedy is to go ahead by minimizing public costs, managing the economy and look for new sources of revenue.
We have been implementing the best remedial measures. The national project that we inaugurated today will protect environment on one hand and, on the other hand, it will convert the current expensive energy sources into cheap solar system thereby cutting the state sector energy costs.
Therefore we believe that all will extend their support to make this venture a success. Our aim is to set up solar panels on all state buildings by 2019 to enable them to meet their electricity demand by solar power.
Finance Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga said economic development and environment conservation cannot be separated as both are of paramount importance.
He said that it was welcoming sign that the Finance Ministry inaugurated such a program of national importance.

Rajapaksa supporters hindering Hambantota development to retain political grip: Mujibur
Mahinda Rajapaksa supporters are hindering the development plans of the government to retain their power in Hambantota by hook or by crook, UNP MP Mujibur Rahman said.
He said once the agreement is signed on the Hambantota port project, a committee will be appointed to look into the progress in which former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa will also be one of the members.
Addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday, Rahman said Rajapaksas supporters fear that they will lose their power in Hambantota in another two or three years if the proposed development plans were implemented.
This could be the reason for them to carry out false propaganda that the government has plans to take over religious places, schools and lands of the people, he said.
The government was not engaged in any of these activities. It was during the previous regime that several plans were forcefully implemented without the consent of the public. There was no one left to speak when the former government was in power, Rahman said.
The former government seized the lands of the people to build the Hambantota port. In the first stage 450 families were displaced and in the second stage another 650 families were displaced. Permanent houses were provided to only 10 families, he added.
Rahman said the situation was the same in many areas in Colombo where Gotabaya Rajapaksa forcibly used the lands of the people. MPs Udaya Gammapila, Wimal Weerawansa and Dullus Alahapperuma were also watching these activities.
They did not speak a word against the Rajapaksa government. The lands used for development under the present government are owned by the state, he said.

Rare human experiences
Perhaps it is an inner urge that makes a poet or a poetess express his or her feelings, experience and observations in words. This inner urge has resulted in varying types of poetry which makes us understand what poetry is. When I read the 50 poems by Kamani Jayasekara Voicing the Dumb (2016 Godage) I felt that I am experiencing varying types of creations woven from the commonest of the most rare human experiences. What we often miss from the naked eye is sensitively captured by the poetess.
Feeling sensitively the bliss of a moment paves the way for Kamani Jayasekaras creative process. The basic example comes from the poem 2 titled as Satisfaction. The poetic persona states in a cathartic form.
Thunder clashes
Lightening flashes
Fan pelts the roof
A comfortable chill invades the room
You hear gentle snoring
From the other side of the bed
Turned away from me
Facing the wall
As you go on the reader feels a sense of whats next
Jayasekaras poetic creations have gone a long way from the ordinary. She is freer in her expression, and the poetic structures are more creative as boiling situations via dialogues and monologues. One good example is the poem titled as Situational Comedy. This poetic work underlined the gruesome situation in the university academic competitions arise in real non academic climates in the race for higher positions suck as deanships and other ranks.
Perhaps with a smile, the poetic persona in this direction says:
The faculty divided into functions
Propaganda at its worst
Even drawing in the personal
Questioning what had not been questioned
Focusing on criteria
Never regarded as worthy
Making one fear for the
Vision and mission of
The halls of learning
Jayasekara never passes judgments though she indirectly points out the possible judgment. Jayasekara as a creator draws inspiration from the day to day academic experiences. She excels in this venture in the poem titled as Ethical Lessons. The poetic creation centres round a dialogue that ensues between the individuals: a sender and the other the replacement.
Perhaps Jayasekara sees the ironic situations in her own field of work at the university, at times it so happens that the administrative structures obstruct the academic situations of both the student and the teacher. The tendency seems to reach a climax in the case of examinations. Jayasekara selects such a student where an external student finds it different to sit for a particular paper or face an interview as he or she is suffering from sickness like chicken pox. But the ethico-administrative structure finds it difficult to find a situation by way of either pardon or excuse.
They have to abide by the regulations or bureaucratic frame of reference, strictly laid down.
The religious, spiritual and creative spirit is seen in her creations. This experience could be stated as a trance (dhyana) in the mind of the poetess who experienced the bliss of living and at the same time the severe distress and why it happens.
In the poem titled Lessons, the reader may see the lessons in intimacy and aloofness of human contacts distancing one from the mere barriers of didactic verses. The poetic experience lays two layers, the upper layers of expression and the hidden layer of a vision.
A faint fragrance of cologne
Instead of the musky smell of living
Clean, sundried, unruffled sheets
On the spacious bed securing privacy
Setting a perfect atmosphere
Then comes the moment of illumination:
Making you wish that
You may not fall into slumber
Not before you fully
Savour the beauty of luxury
The poetic persona is unmasked and moved by what happens around. Instead a sense of discovery is perceived. Can an ordinary layman become a sensitive poet or a poetess Where lies the latent talent to possess the skills of poetic abilities Is it the mere observation, the mere verifying ability or the tradition-bound knowhow conventions As a reader of Jayasekaras poems I was for a moment enmeshed in these questions.
The response via the pages of Voicing of the Dumb for me happened to be enticing and enlightening. I was moved by some of the creations, albeit entrapped by the depiction of human conditions that go into the creative expressions. Some of them transcend the mere norms trails that one often observes in poetry.
Being a scholar in western classics, Kamani Jayasekara is driven often to allude her creations to her learned sources. One good example is Adultery.
The brevity of creation and economy of the use of poetic diction is a poetic gift observed herein. To her credit, this is the eighth collection. Jayasekara has been the recipient of several literary awards. I note the commendable effort with raised interest in the field of contemporary literary scene.

Ravi, Asia-Pacific Finance Minister of the Year - The Banker magazine
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake has been selected as the Finance Minister of the Year for Asia-Pacific by the prestigious The Banker magazine for his efforts to steer Sri Lanka into a new era of economic reform and a change of mindset. The banker a prestigious international financial publication published in London inter alia select the finance minister of the year who has best managed to stimulate growth and stabilise the economy of their country. Accordingly for the 2016 Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake has been selected as the Finance minister of the year 2016 award.
The Banker says Karunanayake secured a $ 1.5 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan program that the country needed to avoid a balance of payments crisis, replenish reserves and rebuild confidence among international investors.
Sri Lankas latest bond issues in the international capital markets suggest Karunanayake has indeed reached his objective. In 2015, the sovereign issued a $ 1.5 billion dual-tranche note, its largest
since 2007.
A year later, it printed a second bond of the same size, with order books of $ 6.6 billion, despite market volatility after the UK voted to leave the EU.
Sri Lanka is also working towards fiscal consolidation. Sri Lankas budget deficit has dropped from 7% when Karunanayake took office in January 2015 to 5.4% in 2016  below the targeted expectations of 5.6%.
After a visit in September 2016, the IMF said Sri Lankas tightening of fiscal and monetary policies has been effective and that it met the IMF programs targets through to the end of June 2016.
According to latest Sri Lankas total government revenue grew from Rs. 1205 in 2014 to Rs. 1,461 billion in 2015. Tax revenue rose from Rs. 1,050 billion to Rs. 1,356 billion in the same period. This is crucial for Sri Lanka, which has a very low tax revenue-to-gross domestic product ratio.

Ronaldo, Ranieri scoop top FIFA awards
Zurich: Cristiano Ronaldo claimed FIFAs inaugural best player of the year award on Monday, the latest prize for the Real Madrid and Portugal star after a glittering 2016 for club and country.
Leicester Citys Claudio Ranieri received the best mens coach award following his sides fairytale Premier League triumph.
But the night again belonged to the 31-year-old Ronaldo, who edged out long-time nemesis Lionel Messi for the trophy as well as Frances Antoine Griezmann, the top player at this summers European championship. Ronaldo had already won the Ballon dOr after his third Champions League title, thanks largely to his 16 goals in 12 games, as well as triumphing with Portugal at Euro 2016 -- the countrys first major prize.
Leicester Citys Italian manager Claudio Ranieri (L) is presentend with The Best FIFA Mens Coach of 2016 Award by former Argentine football player Diego Maradona. AFP
2016 was the best year of my career, Ronaldo said after being handed the prize from FIFA President Gianni Infantino.
Ranieri, 65, who saw off Real boss Zinedine Zidane and Portugal manager Fernando Santos, said the best coach honour was incredible after receiving the prize from Argentine football legend Diego Maradona.
Under Ranieris leadership, Leicester pulled off one of the greatest shocks in English football history by defying title odds of 5,000-1 to lift the Premier League trophy last season. Having miraculously avoided relegation the previous season, the Foxes rode that wave of momentum all the way to the title.
The prizes were based on a combined voting process involving national team coaches and captains, a select group of journalists and fans. Ronaldo took 34.5 percent of the vote over 26.4 percent to Messi, who skipped the awards show co-hosted by US actress and former Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria.
Barcelona said Messi was focused on preparing for an upcoming match against Athletic Bilbao.
US midfielder Carli Lloyd scooped the best womens player of 2016, the two-time Olympic gold medallist adding to her 2015 FIFA Womens World Player of the Year accolade.
The American finished ahead of Brazilian star Marta and Germanys Melanie Behringer.
She described 2016 as bittersweet, with the US failing to win a medal for the first time in womens Olympic football. Spains La Liga accounted for nine of the 11 players in the FIFPro team of the year with Ronaldo and Messi headlining a star-studded line-up.
Ronaldo was joined by Real team-mates Sergio Ramos, Marcelo, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric while the side comprised four Barcelona players with Gerard Pique, Andres Iniesta and Luis Suarez joining Messi.
Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer -- named to the FIFPro World 11 for the fourth year running -- was the only player selected without links to Spains top two clubs. Juventus defender Dani Alves was included for a sixth time having helped Barca to a league and cup double before leaving the Camp Nou for Italy last June.
FIFA also gave a fair play prize to the Colombian side Atletico Nacional.
The team had asked South Americas football governing body to award a regional club title to Chapecoense after most of the Brazilian side perished in a plane crash on the way to the first leg of the final.
World footballs governing body launched the new award series after ending its six-year collaboration with France Football magazine for the Ballon dOr.
The change is one of many implemented under Infantino, who took over FIFA last year pledging to lead it away from the scandals that dominated the end of Sepp Blatters tenure.
Speaking on the so-called green carpet outside the Zurich awards venue, Maradona said the prizes helped define a new FIFA identity.
After everything that was taken away from football, everything that was tainted by corruption, to see new people, new faces, that provides me with hope, Maradona said. AFP

Rs. 1.5 billion drug manufacturing factory to be set up in Sri Lanka
The Health Ministry will sign an agreement with the Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA) today to construct a Rs. 1.5 billion worth drug production factory in Sri Lanka, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, the agreement will be signed at the Health Ministry in the presence of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne. Annually Sri Lankan Government spends Rs. 55 Billion on importing drugs.
Only 32 drugs from a total of 12,100 drugs required for Sri Lanka are manufacturing at the State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) at present. With the construction of the new factory, Sri Lanka will be able to save a large amount of foreign exchange while supplying locally made high quality drugs to state hospitals, the sources said. The entire drug requirement of the country is expected to manufacture locally by 2018 and already 32 companies have signed agreements with Sri Lanka to open drug manufacturing factories in the island, the sources added.

Rubber can raise  US$ 5 bn soon  -Minister
Rubber and rubber value addition will result in foreign exchange earnings of about US$ 5 billion in the short run said Plantation Industries Minister, Navin Dissanayake.
However, such influences being unavoidable, the minister indicated that Rubber and rubber value addition will result in foreign exchange earnings of about US$ 5 billion in the short run.
Expert feedback has indicated that oil prices will continue dominance of rubber price structures.
However, such influences being unavoidable, the minister indicated that Rubber and rubber value addition will result in foreign exchange earnings of about US$ 5 billion in the short run. Indicators were that oil prices will stabilise at current levels for about a year. Consequential to such stabilisation the projected US$ 5 billion earnings were real assessments of the rubber market.
Dissanayake noted that irrespective of reduced production, the recent price escalation of rubber placed Sri Lanka in the billion dollar foreign exchange earner segment in 2016. This would further improve with oil price influences gaining dollar value resulting in concomitant increases in rubber prices.
Sri Lankan rubber will establish hub status for products although other countries have far exceeded our country in rubber production.The import of rubber to bridge the production gap will ensure that the hitherto established reputation of our rubber products will continue to influence markets worldwide, Dissanayake said in an interview.
Commenting of the multi-million dollar Rigid Tyre project that was opened in Horana last week he said that it would do well for the local rubber sector. This was a meaningful investment and a harbinger for more investments in other parts of the country as well by foreign investors.
Asked whether already established companies producing tyres and other value added products would be complementary to the current situation of other manufacturers or competitive to their position, the minister responded that competition was encouraged, more so there would never be enough competition for rubber because of the wide spectrum of possibilities that in real terms could be described as limitless. (SS)
He said that local consumption of rubber was over 22,000 metric tonnes, but production was barely 80 percent of this figure. The production gap was bridged through imports for value addition and exports.

Minister Dissanayake observed that tea and coconut imports were mainly resisted by the smallholder sector, which feared their livelihood, would be seriously affected.

SLFP has not decided to continue with Executive Presidency - Chandrika
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has not taken a decision to continue with the Executive Presidency, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge said yesterday.
Answering a question from a journalist following a media briefing in Colombo, the former President said that if such a proposal is on offer, it should be presented to the SLFP Central Committee and get the approval.
While admitting she too had heard comments on the above subject she said, however, the SLFP had not taken any decision on the matter. She said although there was no war in the country, one cannot be satisfied with the progress of the efforts to usher in reconciliation between the two major communities.
She said all should set aside petty differences and join hands to usher in lasting reconciliation and unity. The former President was addressing the media on National Unity and Reconciliation through Higher Education.
The event was organised by the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation and the University Grants Commission.

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party Youth Front (SLFPYF) requested President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday to consider if the factories that are to be set up in the Hambantiota Industrial Zone are environmental friendly or if they were on the banned list in China.
SLFPYE president Shantha Bandara made this request at a press conference at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) headquarters.
He added that setting up of factories in the industrial zone is commendable but said they have to be cautious about factories that are to be set up in the country. Bandara said there are many factories banned by China, Japan and India in their countries due to environmental factors.
There are more than 50 types of factories banned in Beijing, by the Chinese government and environmentalists, Bandara said. Even the the internet contains information on them. He added that the President as the Environment Minister should take decisions that would not affect the environment. Bandara said it was great expectations that the industrial zones are being set up in the country but these zones should be green industrial zones.
SLFP Youth Front media Secretary Asanka Ediriweera also spoke.

SLIC yet to receive  Deposited  Guarantee Money from Seychelles, Maldives
Sri Lanka Insurance has to get over US dollars 500,000 from insurance regulators in the Seychelles and the Maldives that were deposited as guarantees, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Joint Managing Director T.M.R. Bangsa Jayah said.
In an interview with Daily News Business he said they found that the operations in Seychelles that were started by the management appointed by the previous government were not profitable.
There is a limited population in the Seychelles and there are only a few motor vehicles to insure.On top of that there are three well established insurers in the Seychelles and to compete with them is almost impossible due to a limited population.
Hence recently we decided to pullout from there after a board decision. Commenting on the Maldives operations he said that though Sri Lanka Insurance (SLI) went before Ceylinco Insurance, the SLI product was neglected. Due to this Ceylinco has now got the upper hand and we cannot compete and we had decided to pull out.
The joint MD said in both countries they were asked to make a deposit of US$ 250,000 each and Sri Lankan Insurance is yet to get this back from both Seychelles and the Maldives. Asked to comment of the ongoing inquiries into irregularities he said that the present management is working closely with investigators (FCID) and are assisting them.
We have now found new documentary proof of CSN (Sports TV channel) deals with SLI and have forwarded them to the FCID.
Jayah said that some incidents have come to light where some of the former senior management members have passed payments from SLI even to paint their private residences.

Some oppose industrial zone while enjoying perks as MPs: Chief Minister
Industrial development is very essential to develop the country and provide employment to unemployed youth. When steps are taken to create an industrial zone in Hambantota for that purpose, some sections are opposing it and demonstrating, while enjoying all perks as Members of Parliament.
The public should not fall prey to the falsehoods spread by such protesters, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijeyalal de Silva said. He was addressing a meeting after laying the foundation stones for a two storeyed building planned by the Chief Ministry and the Ambalangoda MPCS at Manampita to house the Manampita Primary Co-operative shop and Rural Bank.
The Chief Minister said large scale development projects damaged the environment. "But such projects could not be shelved either on grounds of environmental damage. What should be done is to minimise the environmental damage caused by such projects to the maximum possible extent."
He said the President would not allow any harm being caused to the people. The Hambantota development project would be undertaken without causing any loss of traditional land belonging to its people, the Chief Minister said.
He said people who kept mum when the previous regime launched harmful development projects were now being irked when the present government launched gigantic projects for the development of the country and also for the progress of the people.
He said certain people questioned him whether he had changed his loyalties, the Chief Minister said. De Silva said he would never change and would firmly stand behind the present leader of the SLFP. He said according to the people's mandate given to him, he will be Chief Minister of the Southern Province until April 2019.

South Africas Amla seeks form in 100th Test
JOHANNESBURG, Tuesday : Hashim Amla will become the eighth South African to appear in 100 Test matches in the third and final Test against Sri Lanka starting at the Wanderers Stadium on Thursday.
Although South Africa are overwhelming favourites after comfortable wins in the first two Tests, the match has significance for the hosts and for Amla in particular.
It will be a test of the team culture achieved under the captaincy of Faf du Plessis and an opportunity for Amla to bat his way out of a rare slump in form.
Fast bowler Kyle Abbott shocked Du Plessis, his fellow players and team management during the second Test in Cape Town when he revealed that five months previously he had signed a Kolpak contract to play county cricket in England.
Abbotts contract with Cricket South Africa was immediately cancelled, breaking up a match-winning fast bowling combination and creating doubt about the levels of trust within the camp. Abbott is just one of six current or recent international players to have chosen to go the Kolpak route, raising what Du Plessis described as a red flag for South African cricket. Although uncapped fast bowler Duanne Olivier was called up to join the squad, Abbotts likely replacement is existing squad member Wayne Parnell, a left-arm fast bowler who has had a stop-start career, mainly because of injuries. The most recent of Parnells four Test appearances was three years ago.
Parnell will add variety to the attack, although he may not be able to replicate the tight control exerted by Abbott in his new ball partnership with the accurate Vernon Philander.
Parnell was released from the squad during the Cape Town Test and was man of the match for the Cape Cobras franchise, taking six wickets and hitting a century in a win against the Lions.
Amla, by a distance the most experienced player in a team missing injured stars AB de Villiers, Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel, has not hit a half-century in his most recent five Test matches, during which he has scored 195 runs at an average of 21.66.
His slump has caused his career average to drop below 50 for the first time in four years.
Amlas career average of 49.46 in nine matches at the Wanderers almost exactly replicates his career average of 49.45. He has hit two of his 25 Test centuries at the ground, most recently against Australia in November 2011. While there are concerns about Amlas batting form, most of South Africas top order have fired during the series. Sri Lankas batsmen, by contrast, have failed to come to terms with the pace, bounce and lateral movement of South African pitches.
The tourists have managed just two individual half-centuries in the first two Tests and captain Angelo Mathews, with 149 runs at an average of 37.25, is the only batsman to have an average above 30.
The Sri Lankan batsmen will need to show a major improvement on a pitch which traditionally offers fast bowlers the most assistance of any of South Africas Test venues. AFP

## Title: Sri Lanka needs economic knowhow
## Supertitle:

Sri Lanka needs economic knowhow
Professor Ricardo Hausmann of the Harvard Kennedy School of Government delivered a lecture entitled Increasing your chances of success while leaving your comfort zone: adapting Sri Lankas growth model to new constraints, yesterday at BMICH.
Hausmann, who runs the Kennedy Schools Center for International Development, and his team have been studying Sri Lankas economy for the past year. His lecture spanned over two hours and covered the countrys current economic shortcomings and its paths to increased growth. His findings, to be frank, are not entirely optimistic about the future of the economy.
He did mention, however, that Sri Lanka scores well in the human development index and has excellent levels of adult literacy and life expectancy, leading South Asia in these categories. Poverty has also been markedly reduced.
The problem, though, is that the post-war growth has slowed over the past four years, hovering at around 4% annually. Why has this occurred
Export growth
What is clear is that the boom that happened in the post-war period was associated with a widening credit deficit. These growth accelerations in Sri Lanka have tended to happen with a widening current account deficit, Hausmann said.
While government spending propped up economic growth in the years after 2009, export growth did not keep pace. When GDP increases, imports tend to increase as well. If exports do not keep up with imports, the current account deficit widens and growth then necessarily slows down.
There is importance in the speed at which you can grow your exports so that they can accompany the growth of the rest of the economy, he said, while adding that Sri Lankas export growth lags far behind those of countries like Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.
Central to this dearth of exports is a lack of diversity in exports. Between the years 2000 and 2015, China added 76 products to its export basket that were worth $245 per capita. Thailand added 70 products for a gain of $326 per capita. By comparison, Sri Lanka started producing a measly five products worth seven dollars per capita.
It is clear, according to Hausmann, that Sri Lanka is very much in need of export-diversification. Whereas the islands main exports of tea, rubber, precious stones, and garments have remained somewhat static for many years, China has diversified into higher-productivity sectors like electronics, machinery, and chemicals, allowing it to become increasingly wealthy.
But how does a country diversify into new, more complicated industries
For Hausmann, the key is increasing a countrys knowhow, which, though it sounds akin to knowledge, cannot be easily communicated. Knowhow is learned over a long period of time through imitation and repetition.You dont teach your kids to walk by explaining it to them. They learn by repeating the process and imitating other people. Knowhow is the capacity of the brain to recognize patterns that it has seen in the past and respond accordingly. It is the wiring of the brain, he said.
Possess different skills
People in underdeveloped societies, though they possess the knowhow to farm, create tools, and survive in their environments, do not have a wide range of knowhow.
For example, most Inuits know how to build igloos and catch fish, but they would not know how to build a cell phone. Someone in a developed society wouldnt know how to build a cell phone herself, but a team of people from that society would be able to work together to build a phone.
These teams of individuals who possess different skills and knowhow are crucial to diversifying and developing economies. By putting heads together, you can create more complicated, higher-value products.
It is here that Hausmann explained the Scrabble Theory of economic development, wherein he likened sets of skills to letters used to play scrabble. If you have the letter A, you can make one word. If you have four letters, you can make nine words, and with 10 letters you can make 595 words that are complex and long.
Hausmanns supposition is that developed countries with diverse export baskets have access to many letters, or skill sets, that they can combine in order to make complicated and valuable products.
If a country has little knowhow, it can make only a few short words that are relatively easy to make. Places that have many letters can make many products that are harder to make, he said.
There is a very strong correlation, according to Hausmann, between having many letters and wealth.
The Scrabble theory holds true across countries, as France has more letters than a country like Pakistan, but it is also true when one examines regions within countries. In Sri Lanka, those in the Colombo area make more products and enjoy greater wealth than those in Mullaitivu and Mannar.
Overall, Sri Lanka holds a middling number of letters, which leads to a lack of complexity in its exports: Sri Lankas economic complexity was low in 1995 compared with other comparable countries, and it remains low now, he said.
The problem you have in Sri Lanka is that you dont have enough knowhow and dont have enough letters, or skills to become richer. So, how do you get more letters, he asked.
Acquiring more skills is difficult; you dont know how to make the things you dont know how to make. As Hausmann said, you cannot make watches without watchmakers.
This problem can be eased, however, by starting to make products that are similar to things you can already make. For example, countries that make womens shirts will easily be able to make womens suits. On the other hand, if you can drill holes for oil, a very specialized skill, you will not be able to transfer that skill onto other industries.
By creating a product map, one can see how diverse and connected a countrys products are. China, for instance, is very adept at making garments, construction materials, machinery and electronics. This diverse product map allows it to manufacture very complicated, valuable products.
Manufacturing electronics
Sri Lankas products, conversely, are not very well connected, which means that the country lacks the knowhow to expand into new sectors. In short, Sri Lankas knowledge of tea cultivation does not transfer to manufacturing electronics.
To make matters worse, Sri Lanka has shown very little diversification over the past twenty years. Vietnam, a country that ranked below Sri Lanka in terms of export diversity in 1995, has now surpassed the island, mostly due to its expansion into electronics.
We think about growth as the accumulation of knowhow. Its not going from dumb to genius. It is going from a society where everybody knows how to do the same thing to a society where people know how to make many different things. This means a society where people can make electronics, cars and pharmaceuticals, he said.
These diagnoses, though useful, do not offer a clear blueprint for improving the economic diversity of Sri Lanka.
The last section of his speech dealt with the problem of moving knowhow across boarders, which is very difficult since it cannot simply be explained.
Hausmann concentrated the last section of his lecture on five mechanisms that have traditionally been used to diffuse knowhow: labour mobility between firms, immigration, Diasporas, business travel and foreign direct investment (FDI).
The first mechanism, labour mobility between firms, is not that useful in Sri Lankas case because there is a general lack of knowhow within the country. More important, then, is immigration reform and opening up of the country to foreigners.
1% of people living in Sri Lanka are foreign-born, and 99% of those were born in India. If you look at a country like Singapore, about 40% of the residents were born outside the country. This mixing allows for great diffusion of knowhow, as people from different areas bring different skills to the table, he said.
Productive development policies
Moreover, Sri Lanka should try to take advantage of its large Diaspora in order to gain skills and knowhow. Improved engagement with Sri Lankans living abroad is currently not taking place.
Sri Lanka does not benefit much from business travel, and it has not seen a sustained increase in FDI since the end of the conflict. Furthermore, Hausmann explained that many potential projects with neighbouring countries have been turned down since 2010, and he recommended that Sri Lanka do its best to engage with foreign countries on joint ventures that would spread knowhow and be economically profitable.
He therefore recommended immigration and Diaspora policy reforms and called for productive development policies for economic complexity. In order to increase economic complexity, Hausmann recommended Sri Lanka ask itself how to better serve the industries that exist and how it can improve the environment so that new industries would come to the country.
With regard to industries that already operate in the country, he recommended better cooperation between the government and private sector, a higher focus on productivity instead of profitability, and increased willingness for joint projects. He also said that increased transparency is key for creating better conditions for companies that operate here.
In terms of attracting new industries, he recommended setting up institutions to search for possibilities and their related obstacles.
Finally, he encouraged active investment seeking, spearheaded by direct marketing campaigns, and conversations with investors that reveal opportunities.

The President's Office and the Office for National Unity (ONUR) led by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga launched a mass communications campaign to raise awareness of Sri Lankan Shared Values to achieve the mindsets for national unity and reconciliation.
The campaign, timed for National Integration and Reconciliation Week, commenced on January 8.
Following a number of initiatives related to building national unity and reconciliation in the areas of arts and culture, education, conflict transformation, psycho-social support, livelihood development, and assistance to female headed households carried out in various parts of the country by ONUR in addition to its work in policy interventions over the last two years, we are now embarking on reaching out widely to create an appropriate mindset among citizens through this public awareness campaign, ONUR Chairperson Kumaratunga stated.
The campaign is based on the insight that the nations long-standing divisive issues which have adversely affected national unity, need to be addressed through offering an alternative proposition that will forge a unified national identity and celebration of the nations diversity among all Sri Lankans.
The campaign thus seeks to get people to question for themselves what being a True Sri Lankan really means.
As a replacement for the old paradigm of identity defined by labels of ethnicity and religion which has been the entrenched in the psyche of most people, the campaign offers a new identity based on certain common characteristics Sri Lankans possess, which the campaign brings out as Sri Lankan Shared Values.
Six Sri Lankan Shared Values, such as Respect for others of various diversities, Compassion and caring towards fellow citizens as taught by all religions, the reinstatement of Peace-Building and non-violence in a post-war era, Social Justice for all disadvantaged and marginalized fellow citizens including the willingness to right any wrongs, the adoption of Collaboration among diverse people as means of building greater opportunities for all, layered on our famed Sri Lankan Hospitality, generosity and friendliness as a people, are highlighted in the campaign for appreciation and adoption as the route to a united, progressive, inclusive and plentiful nation.
The pro bono campaign, conceptualized by Bates Strategic Alliance, which broke on mainstream and social media has brought on board several civil society opinion leaders and celebrities to speak from their hearts in the campaigns messaging.
Among these are Sarvodayas A.T. Ariyaratne and actress Iranganie Serasinghe, youth activists Thisuri and Senel Wanniarchchi, Trail-blazers Sarinda Unamboowa and Nathan Sivagananathan, entertainers Sunil Perera and Marians Nalin Perera, Everest climber Johann Peries, Tourism industry leader Hiran Cooray, cricketers Jehan Mubarak and Muttiah Muralitharan, and renowned artistes Upeka Chitrasena and Taji Dias, actress Kaushalya Fernando, former minister and diplomat Ferial Ashroff, filmmaker Illango Ram, and artistes Mathanavasan and Mahinda Kumar.
Journalists and bloggers also support the campaign.

Struggling Lanka must show more resolve
The news that Cricket South Africa has decided to replace a scheduled tour by Sri Lanka with India in 2017-18 is certainly disturbing and should not be treated lightly by Sri Lanka Cricket.
In the words of Cricket South Africa (CSA) chief executive Haroon Lorgat: I've given an indication to Sri Lanka that that tour is unlikely. We've got a very packed season coming up, starting with Bangladesh in the early season. We've got India touring for four Test matches plus five ODIs and three T20s, and then we follow with Australia for four Test matches. It's very unlikely, and I've already given the indication to Sri Lanka that they should avail themselves to someone else.
What it means is that Sri Lanka are no longer a team that attracts spectators or sponsorships and the ongoing tour to South Africa is a clear indication of that. It is no secret that CSA has suffered untold losses during the first two Tests of the three-Test series with both matches ending inside the distance and more than a day to spare. And CSA foresees further losses in the third Test starting at Johannesburg on January 12 and in the three T20 Internationals and five One-Day Internationals to follow which on South Africas current form Sri Lanka look no-hopers even before the toss unless by some miracle they can turn things around.
CSAs decision to scrap the tour there by Sri Lanka and replace them with India does not abode well for the countrys cricket future and it goes back to the days when Sri Lanka who were struggling to find their feet on the Test arena in the eighties and early nineties had to fight tooth and nail with other established Test nations for international matches.
However Ashley de Silva, CEO of Sri Lanka Cricket denied that CSAs decision to replace Sri Lanka with another nation had anything to do with financial losses. Following our current tour to South Africa we are scheduled to tour them again at the end of 2017 and South Africa are due to visit us in 2018. So it is too many back to back tours with one nation. According to the FTP (Future Tours Program) the tour is still on but we will discuss the matter and take a final call at the ICC chief executives meeting in Dubai next month, said De Silva.
Even without the tour to South Africa at the end of 2017, Sri Lanka will still have a lot of matches scheduled for the year. Following the current tour to South Africa which ends on February 10, Sri Lankas schedule for the rest of the year is:
March  host Bangladesh for 2 Tests, 3 ODIs and 2 T20Is
May  to England for ICC Champions Trophy
June-July  host Zimbabwe for 2 Tests and 3 ODIs
August-September  host India for 3 Tests, 5 ODIs and 1 T20I
October-November  tour UAE (Pakistan) for 3 Tests, 5 ODIs and 2 T20Is.
So despite Sri Lankas disappointing show in South Africa where the team is still in the stages of rebuilding following the retirements of iconic players like Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan and the absence from the firing line of Lasith Malinga (recuperating from a knee injury), they have enough cricket lined-up with three series at home to enable the young uns in the team to establish themselves as truly international cricketers.
Every team goes through lean phases following the retirement of top players and Sri Lanka are no exception. They have over the years gone through such periods but had sufficient replacements to bridge the gaps that existed. What is taking the current team so long is the batting which lacks discipline and resolve. This comes from a poor domestic competition where there are plenty of loose balls to score runs off, but whereas in the international circuit they rarely find one coming their way. And eventually when it comes the batsman tries to capitalize on it and in his over eagerness to score, he either plays the ball too early, mistimes it or plays a rash shot which leads to his dismissal.
The current problem the national team is facing in South Africa is with their batting which has not shown the discipline, skill and patience that is required to build an innings. The South African bowlers know its only a matter of time before the batsman loses his patience and goes for an expansive stroke that gets him out. So all they have to do is to keep bowling a tight line and length and test the batsmens discipline. The type of bowling Sri Lanka is facing in South Africa is a far cry from what they come up in their domestic matches. That is where the batsmen have a big gap to bridge. So until that hole is plugged Sri Lanka will fail to put up sufficient runs of the board for their bowlers to bowl at. It is said that the first innings of any match is the most important and in this aspect Sri Lanka has failed miserably in the first two Tests being dismissed for totals of 205 at Port Elizabeth and 110 at Cape Town, which has seen them unable to put any pressure on the South Africans at any stage of the game. Losing is all part and parcel of the game. If the present side can learn from its mistakes, that will be a moral victory for the team and its future.

The Terrain less travelled
Jeep Sri Lanka frequently organizes outdoor adventure activities for their loyal customers who loves to go anywhere, do anything. Adventure is a part of the DNA of every Jeep Brand vehicle ever built and as long as curiosity drives man to explore the edges of heaven and earth, the Jeep Brand will continue to inspire him to go beyond. Freedom, adventure and passion are some of the core values of Jeep.
Jeep Club of Sri Lankas Annual Expedition was themed the Coast Less Travelled for 2016 and covered some of the most gruelling,scenic and exciting terrains and tracks along the coastal belts of North Western, Northern and Eastern part of Sri Lanka. Seventeen members of the Jeep Club of Sri Lanka (JCSL) took part and DIMO came on board as the main sponsor as the only authorized distributor for Jeep in Sri Lanka.
JCSL together with DIMO organised the Coast Less Travelled from the 10th to the 13th of December 2016. The expedition commenced from DIMO 800 and went on to Jaffna during the first day. The route took the drivers through the flora and fauna of the Wilpattu National Park whilst experiencing the scenic and breathtaking views of Kudrimalai Point where King Vijaya landed. Lunch for the members were served on the Talaimannar Pier organised by the Sri Lanka Army. The first day drive ended at Jaffna covering approx. 420 km and the drivers stayed the night at Jetwing Jaffna.
The second day consisted of a 180 km drive from Jaffna to Mullaitivu. The most interesting part of this route was the 35 km drive across the beach which was tremendously breathtaking and exciting. The beach drive was another opportunity for the drivers to learn and enjoy the techniques of sand driving, especially in a Jeep. All members enjoyed the capabilities of their Jeeps, which for some were a novel experience. The experts in the JCSL were always at hand to teach the others on manoeuvring in sand and water and working with tides and tyre pressure. Lunch was served at Maradankeny beach and they were accommodated at bungalows for their second stay.
The third day saw the members drive from Mullaitivu to Trincomalee covering approx. 130km. This trail included a 25 km jungle run and which went through the devastation and damage caused by the war. After having lunch the members went on another 10 km beach drive which was equally scenic as the other. Overnight stay was at arranged at TrincoBlu by Cinnamon where everyone enjoyed the networking session where they could share their knowledge and stories.
The expedition turned out to be yet again a memorable experience for the Jeep Club members. The experienced and the drive also reassured the members that they have chosen the best off-road vehicle, which is truly a go anywhere do anything vehicle. For 75 years, Jeep Brand vehicles have inspired man to dream and to dare. To go farther, live larger and explore every corner of this amazing world. The Coast Less Travelled was another Jeep event organized to challenge the off-road enthusiast.
Whilst DIMO was the main sponsor of the event, Michelin tires, BF Goodrich tyres, Kumho tires, WD-40, Bosch, Moose Clothing, Sign Tech and Meesha Photography came on board as co-sponsors.

Tiny talent
Child artistes often go unnoticed. Blame it on the bigger names or just how the television industry works. Nevertheless, there are a few actors who are really making their mark in the industry. Kaveesh Vihanga of Sidhu fame is an example of how an tiny tot can bring enormous talent to flesh up a character.
Surprisingly, the six year old does not come across as a beginner because he is just so believable. He plays the role of a free spirited young Buddhist monk Soratha Podi Hamuduruwo in the teledrama. Though he does not play the title role, Kaveesh has proven that he is someone who can give the biggest names on local TV a run for their money.
Q: Describe yourself.
A: I am quite a mischief maker and a chatterbox. I love playing with toys. I am very attached to my family.
Q: What do you think of your role as Soratha Podi Hamuduruwo in Sidhu
A: I got this opportunity after taking part in Derana FMs Punchi Tharuth Ekka Ayubowan program. I did not have much of an idea about what was happening so I was just being myself when I was taken for shooting. The only difference was that I had to wear a saffron robe. I did all that the uncles told me on the sets and they were very happy with the outcome.
Q: What was the first day of the shooting like
A: Shooting takes place in Kurunegala. I have been acting the role since July, 2016. We are picked up and taken to the location.
I had to pick up the cat, Sarana, in my first scene. He was very heavy for me so I was a little afraid. However he escaped as soon I picked him up. That was the first time that I have picked up a cat in my life.
Q: Everybody loves you and your role. You are one of the key factors behind the teledramas success.
A: This is my first experience in acting. I did not imagine that I would become so popular. When I was given the role my parents thought that it must be a normal supporting role but now everywhere I go people recognize me. They want to take photos with me and give me gifts and things to eat.
Even on the sets all the cast and crew adore me. They pick me up in their arms and cuddle me all the time.
Q: Who is your favourite among the cast
A: I love spending time with all of them but Heenbaba Seeya is my favourite. He plays car games with me on the phone and tells me stories.
Q: What was the most difficult scene you had to do
A:It was a scene in which I was lost in the forest. I had to run up a cliff and through trees. It was a very painful experience because several thorns pricked my feet.
Q: Did you encounter any memorable incidents while playing the role
A: Once the director tried to use a helicam to shoot certain scenes. That scared me a lot since I have never seen one before in my life. I thought that it is an alien creature! They had to abandon their efforts because I was crying a lot. They did not use that device for shooting in the end.
In another episode I had to run and jump into the river. I slipped then, fell into the water and got bitten by the fish. That experience too scared me a lot.
Q: Are you an animal lover
A: Yes, I love animals. I am very fond of Sarana. I even asked my mother if we can take Sarana home recently. However he belongs to a member of the crew so that was not possible.
We do not have any pets at home because we do not have much space in our home. However my hobby is collecting birds feathers. I collect feathers wherever I go. I also have a huge collection of birds nests at home.
Q: What if you were actually Soratha Podi Hamuduruwo Would you have been different from him and the things he does
A: Well I dont think so. I am pretty much myself when I play Podi Hamuduruwo. I am even at ease with my robe. So since Podi Hamuduruwo is me I think everything will proceed in the same manner.
Q: Did you get any other teledrama or film role offers
A:Yes. But we have a contract on not to sign for any other projects till Sidhu concludes. Shooting for Sidhu keeps me busy. We engage in shooting during the weekends and school holidays. My mother accompanies me when I go for shooting. We are picked up at 6 am and it is past 8 pm when we come home again. Therefore the shooting schedule has not gotten in the way of my studies. There have been days when continuous shooting has tired me. Then I tell my mother that I feel that now it is enough for the day. However I have never tired of acting. I love playing the role!
Apart from Sidhu I am also involved in Derana FMs Punchi Tharu Ekka Ayubowan program. I draw and sing during my free time.
Q: Tell us a bit about your background and family.
A: There are four members in my family. I have a younger brother who is a bit over two years. My father, Sampath Madhusanka, is attached to Lanka Tiles. My mother Chathurika Priyangani is a housewife. I live in Hanwella. I went Sri Parakrama Maha Vidyalaya, Panagoda. I joined St Peters College, Colombo, this year. I wish to thank Sarani Perera and Roshan Perera who are administrators at the British School for getting me the opportunity to enter St Peters College.
Q: What is your ambition
A: It actually changes from time to time. I want to become a doctor now. Some time back I wanted to become an engineer.
Q: What is your message to other children who wish to excel in their talents
A: I got this opportunity by chance when I took part in a childrens program on Derana FM. I would like to encourage other children too to take part in such programs and showcase their talents to the world. My mothers uncle, punchi and Nimesh Kulasinghe who is the music director at Derana helped me a lot throughout this venture. I wish to thank them for all that they have done to support me.

Top-ranked Kerber stunned by Russian teen
Sydney: Russian teenager Daria Kasatkina put Angelique Kerber's Australian Open preparations in a spin with a straight-sets upset win over the world number one at the Sydney International on Tuesday.
The 19-year-old, ranked 26, underlined her huge potential with a confident performance to take out the German, 7-6 (7/5), 6-2 in a second-round match played in sweltering conditions.
Only last week Kasatkina held a match point before going down to French Open champion Garbine Muguruza in the second round at the Brisbane International.
While she continues her march, Kerber's form is a concern ahead of next week's opening Grand Slam of the year, having also lost to Ukraine's Elina Svitolina 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the quarter-finals of the Brisbane International last week.
Kerber, who had a breakthrough 2016, winning two Grand Slams on her way to becoming world number one, struggled to find any rhythm and her usually strong forehand was astray. Asked about her emotions after her biggest win yet, Kasatkina said courtside: "Difficult to explain because I beat the number one in the world and it doesnt happen every day. I think I got some confidence."
It was a day of upsets in Sydney where temperatures sizzled around 36 Celsius (97 Fahrenheit) with defending champion Svetlana Kuznetsova and last year's finalist Dominika Cibulkova both knocked out in the second round.
World number nine Kuznetsova went out to Russian compatriot Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 7-5, 6-3 while Canada's Eugenie Bouchard continued her return to form with a 6-4, 6-3 win over the sixth-ranked Cibulkova.
Former Wimbledon finalist Bouchard, who has now won consecutive matches at a tournament for the first time since August, stretched her lead over Cibulkova to 4-1 head-to-head and will face Pavlyuchenkova in the last eight.
"Any time you play one of the best players in the world it's like a standard of where you're at," Bouchard said.
"I have taken a couple of solid steps this week, but I'm far from where I want to be. Even though I won, to me, I could do a lot of things better."
World number 27 Pavlyuchenkova, who knocked out Australian number one Samantha Stosur in the first round, won in her first career meeting with Kuznetsova.
Ninth-seeded Italian Roberta Vinci was another seed to fall, losing 6-2, 6-3 to veteran Barbora Strycova of the Czech Republic. AFP

Veterans form ITVA to enhance tourism  knowhow among industry aspirants
A group of tourism and hospitality experts have joined to form the International Tourism Volunteers Association of Sri Lanka (ITVA).
The aim of this body is to put forth an educational platform for individuals from rural backgrounds with a helping hand and the right exposure on how to become better hosts and further bring beneficial change into their livelihoods.
Even at the recent Human Capital Summit which took place at the Taj Samudra for the first time in the country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who graced the event, delivered a talk with highlight on the topic Sri Lanka as a Talent Capital'. He reiterated the need to further develop and enhance three major entities affecting the economy in Sri Lanka; water, energy and human resource. The human resource angle is currently a major issue especially in the hospitality sector. The Prime Minister also emphasized the need to strategise accordingly with the aim of enticing our Sri Lankan expats abroad, to come back to the country.
This might entail mainly dealing with small scale businesses such as homestay owners for example. But, not only will small enterprises get to benefit from this scheme as any other tourism related establishment seeking out a platform of awareness can approach ITVA and gain firsthand knowledge from veterans in the field who will take time to come forth and lend in their knowhow and expertise when it comes to hospitality.
Among the members involved in initiating this association is one of Sri Lanka's best assets in the field of tourism and hospitality and who is also being noted as the world's best trainer in his field, Dilip Francis De Silva and currently attached to the International Labour Organization (ILO). Along with him is Ajit De Silva who is the CEO for Direct Food Ltd. based in Bangladesh, Senior Vice President for Aitken Spence Hotels, Gemunu Goonewardene, Malinda Ratnayake who also happens to be the Vice President of the very first 5 star resort to have been setup in Ahungalla and U. C. Jayasinghe who is a Former Director of Aitken Spence. This group of hoteliers have been instrumental in instigating and evolving the concept of tourism in villages.
Other founding members also include an advisory committee based in Australia and comprises of Rohan De Silva Jayasundera and Rohan Dias Abeysinghe. The Chief Coordinator for ITVA is Former Human Resource Director for Aitken Spence, Amal Nanayakkara.
Commenting on his stance with ITVA, Goonewardene said, Entrepreneurs who run establishments such as homestays tend to lack in technicality and we merely hope to establish a platform which will help small entrepreneurships to understand tourism as a whole and how to be the best host out there. The revered members of ITVA do not look at remolding but to work ahead to fill the gaps in the industry.
The Association had dispatched renowned hoteliers and veterans from the sector to areas such as Kalutara, Batticaloa, Polonnaruwa and Jaffna to conduct workshops for staff working at resorts as well as small hotel enterprises.
ITVA's approach would center on a cost-sharing basis where this association would not look to profit from any memberships and any funds generated would go back into the organization and help fund scholarships for youth towards a career in tourism and hospitality.
The volunteers will engage in seminars and workshops depending on the demand and how much a community is willing to embrace experienced know-how from veterans in the field.

Warning over viral infections during cold weather
The cold weather being experienced increases the circulation of viruses and decrease the immunity of the body. People may experience dryness of skin, nose, etc and may develop runny nose after outdoor activities. The virology Unit of the Medical Research Institute (MRI) reported an increase of the influenza virus, Consultant Community Physician Dr. Kapila Jayaratne said.
According to Dr. Jayaratne, all pregnant mothers should take extra precaution on preventing Influenza during this cold weather and they should get admitted to a hospital immediately if they develop fever.
The Health Ministry advises all pregnant women to take precautions and all those who suffer from fever for over three days should get their blood tested under the instructions of a doctor.
All who suffer from any type of respiratory disease should seek medical advice or get themselves admitted to a hospital immediately if they develop any type of breathing difficulty.
All high risk groups such as infants, children, elderly, pregnant mothers and persons who suffer from chronic diseases should avoid crowded places during this cold weather and wear masks to protect themselves. Washing hands with soap and germ killers are recommended. Sick persons should cover their faces while sneezing and coughing, Dr. Jayaratne advised.
The public should consume warm drinks, nutritious meals and food high in vitamins and minerals during these days to keep up their immunity. They should follow medical advice and use drugs as prescribed. Hospitalisation without delay is also important, he added.

Where ignorance is blissful
Despite several allegations over the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC) that justice must not only be done but also seen to be done, CIABOC Director General Sarath Jayamanne said he was trying to ensure that the standards of investigation, evaluation and decision making are maintained by the Commission.
In an interview with Daily News recently, he said the legal provisions with regard to the bribery and corruption were different compared to other offences and as people were unaware of these procedures, it was only fair that they pointed fingers at the Commission.
Excerpts follow:
Q : There are allegations that there are delays when it comes to prosecuting offenders. Whats your opinion
A: It is fair by the people to accuse the Commission that there is a delay in the process because they are not aware of the legal provisions. All the procedures are done within the Commission and the commissioners or employees are not allowed to speak about the process. Therefore, there is no way that people can know the progress with the investigations.
Unlike other crimes, the offences that are related to bribery and corruption are totally different. When the police deal with the other crimes they can easily point at a suspect. They can arrest the suspect and hand him over to the Magistrates court. But, to prove the offences that are related to bribery and corruption, we need clear and documented evidence to produce to the court.
Q: So the delay is in gathering the evidence
A: Gathering valid evidence is not an easy task. We have to gather strong evidence against the offender or else he will easily escape the trial and claim that he is innocent.
We never produce the suspect before the Magistrate until the case has met the final stage. We have to work on complaints based on allegations. The informers hardly come with evidence. In almost all the cases, we have to collect evidence.
On suspicion, the preliminary investigation will be conducted and after the full investigations all the materials will be presented before the magistrate. The entire investigation is mostly based on the documents. We also have to deal with complex forensic investigations. Public officers are also often involved in these cases. These are very sensitive cases as any person can send a bogus complaint.
It is we who have to formulate the case in a way that the offender could be prosecuted. I have the power to request for all the details related to the investigation that is also one of the reasons why Magistrate is not involved in the preliminary investigations.
Q: What about the investigations related to the politicians under the former as well as the present government
A: Investigations are being conducted and several cases have also been filed against certain individuals. According to the Bribery and Corruption Act, it is prohibited to give information about ongoing investigations to protect the informants as well as to ensure a proper investigation.
There is this new trend that when a person files a complaint to the Bribery Commission, he comes out and gives interviews to the media. The moment they give a piece of paper they think the Commission has to take immediate action. It is not fair by the Commission to reveal the information and the Act does not allow the Commission to take actions without proper investigation.
Cheating, criminal breach of trust and forgery do not come within the provisions of the Commission. The police, CID and FCID should do it. Our mandate focuses on bribery and corruption.
More clearly it is related to the fact that a public servant is prohibited from accepting a gift or a reward from any person to carry out duties or refrain from carrying out duties.
Q: There were allegations that there was political pressure over conducting investigations over certain individuals. Do you agree
A: No. I totally disagree with that. There is no political pressure exerted on the commissioners with regard to any investigations. This is an independent Commission. Since I was appointed I was able to maintain the balance and I will continue to do it.
When we receive a complaint, we discuss and decide whether we need to do a full investigation on grounds of suspicion. I assure that the work of the Commission is being conducted in an impartial and independent manner.
Q: Is it true that the commission is short staffed
A: I do not wish to blame anyone on any issue. But, I would like to suggest that there is a need to increase the capacity of the legal officers. This sector has to be more attractive for the young people to get in. Many young legal officers think twice before getting into this field. Unlike, the Attorney Generals department, the Bribery Commission only has 20 years of history.
If there are able and experienced prosecutors, it would be easy to gather evidence against the offenders and investigations can be conducted quickly.
Q: Do you think changes are needed to the current Bribery and Corruption Act
A: Yes. There is a need to make changes to the present act.
Sri Lanka will have to make several amendments to meet the international standards.
I cannot point out the provisions that need to be changed as discussions are underway with regard to the amendments.
Q: Any initiatives taken by the Commission to reduce acts of bribery and corruption
A: I made a request to the chamber of commerce on Anti-corruption Day not to accept any hampers that are sent during the festive season. The hampers are usually sent as a matter of gratitude but that in a way encourages the public servants to accept gifts. I also sent a letter to the Ministry of Public Administration with regard to that.
Presenting a bribe to get the work done has become the culture in our country. People do not want to wait in queue but look out for ways to do their works as soon as possible. Children should be taught from their younger days the morals of life.
There are also many initiatives taken in collaboration with the Education Ministry to include a few components about bribery and corruption to the curriculum to enrich the knowledge of the students.
If proper systems are in place it will not be easy to break the laws and the chances of bribery and corruption would be minimal.

Why does Siri seem so dumb
Ive been familiar with Siri longer than most people. Way back in 2009, two years before Apple incorporated the intelligent digital assistant into the iPhone, I stood onstage with the inventors of the service while they debuted it at a tech conference I co-produced. At the time, it was just a third-party app on the iPhone App Store. Not long thereafter, Apple bought the company and the assistant reemerged in 2011 with a splashy introduction as a core feature of the iPhone 4S.
In addition to the iPhone, Siri is now on the iPad, and was recently added to the Mac. Its also on Apple TV. Via the phone, its the key user interface in Apples CarPlay infotainment system for autos and even the soon-to-be-released wireless AirPod earbuds.
Siri is also the point of the spear for Apple in the coming tech war, just getting started, to make artificial intelligence a natural, conversational part of your world  at home, on your phone, in your car, everywhere. And Apple had a big head start with Siri.
So why does Siri seem so dumb Why are its talents so limited Why does it stumble so often When was the last time Siri delighted you with a satisfying and surprising answer or action
For me at least, and for many people I know, its been years. Siris huge promise has been shrunk to just making voice calls and sending messages to contacts, and maybe getting the weather, using voice commands. Some users find it a reliable way to set timers, alarms, notes and reminders, or to find restaurants.
But many of these tasks could be done with the crude, pre-Siri voice command features on the iPhone and other phones, albeit in a more clumsy way.
Facebook, and others are on the march. Apple has made excited announcements each time it added knowledge domains like sports and movies and restaurants to Siri on the iPhone. But it seems like it hasnt added any major new topic domains in quite a while.
The only new domain listed on Apples Siri webpage is for controlling home devices compatible with Apples HomeKit platform, a use case thats quite small. You can now use Siri to "turn the lights blue" or "turn on the bathroom heater"  integrations Amazons Echo and Alexa assistant have led the way on. And the always-listening Echo is faster than pressing the iPhones home button to call up Siri and more reliable than the "Hey Siri" command that can be hit or miss.
Whens the presidential debate Siri had no clue.
If you try and treat Siri like a truly intelligent assistant, aware of the wider world, it often fails, even though Apple presentations and its Siri website suggest otherwise. (And Im not talking about getting your voice wrong. In my recent experience, Siri has become quite good at transcribing what Im asking, just not at answering it.)
In recent weeks, on multiple Apple devices, Siri has been unable to tell me the names of the major party candidates for president and vice president of the United States.
Or when they were debating. Or when the Emmy awards show was due to be on. Or the date of the World Series. When I asked it "What is the weather on Crete" it gave me the weather for Crete, Illinois, a small village which  while Im sure its great  isnt what most people mean when they ask for the weather on Crete, the famous Greek island.
Google Now, on the same Apple devices, using the same voice input, answered every one of these questions clearly and correctly. And that isnt even Googles latest digital helper, the new Google Assistant.
If you try most of these broken examples right now, theyll work properly, because Apple fixed them after I tweeted screenshots of most of them in exasperation and asked the company about them.
Apple stressed to me that its constantly improving Siri, and also stressed that it focuses its Siri efforts on the kinds of tasks that it says millions of people ask every day: placing phone calls, sending texts, and finding places. It puts much less emphasis on what it calls "long tail" questions, like the ones Ive cited above, which in some cases, Apple says, number in only the hundreds each day.
But I suspect people dont ask those questions because, after trying a time or two and getting no answers or wrong answers, they just give up on Siri. And I cant see how asking when the 2016 presidential debates are being held is a more "long tail" query than asking when Abraham Lincoln was born. Thats a question Siri not only can answer, but which Apple touts on its website.
Apple also says Siri is focused on enabling you "to work with your device in a hands-free way." But, in my recent tests, it even fails for me, or is inconsistent, too often when relying on data thats right on the device or in iCloud.
For instance, when I asked Siri on my Mac how long it would take me to get to work, it said it didnt have my work address  even though the "me" contact card contains a work address and the same synced contact card on my iPhone allowed Siri to give me an answer.
Similarly, on my iPad, when I asked what my next appointment was, it said "Sorry, Walt, somethings wrong"  repeatedly, with slightly different wording, in multiple places on multiple days. But, using the same Apple calendar and data, Siri answered correctly on the iPhone.
When I asked it for pictures I had taken in York, England, this summer, it mixed them up with pictures I took years ago in Yorktown, Virginia. And yes, it had transcribed the question itself perfectly.
It couldnt find recent iMessages from my daughter-in-law, saying I had none, on the very day shed sent two. And, if you have duplicate information for frequent contacts, Siri isnt smart enough to know which one you use most often or used last time to call or text.
Who is Tim Cook
It also cant distinguish between the question of "who is" a person, and a request for that persons contact card. For instance, I have a contact card for Apple CEO Tim Cook. When I ask "Who is Tim Cook" Siri shows me the contact card, not his bio.
But, on a Samsung Galaxy S7 (Samsungs non-exploding model) which also has a contact card for Cook, Google Now understands the question perfectly and gives me his Wikipedia entry. If I ask Google Now on the Galaxy to "email Tim Cook," it does that, too  just like Siri.
Siri isnt the only element of Apples artificial intelligence strategy.
Its latest operating systems and core apps do some smart things, like guessing an unknown callers name from information in an email.
Or automatically marking on a map where you parked your car. Or notifying you via your Apple watch how long your commute is when your phone connects to the Bluetooth in your car at a certain time of day.
Yes, Siri can usually place a call or send a text. It can tell you sports standings, Yelp restaurant reviews, and movie times  features Apple added years ago. And it must be said that all of its competitors have their own limitations and also make mistakes.
