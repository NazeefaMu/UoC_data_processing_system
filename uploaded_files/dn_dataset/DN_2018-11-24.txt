Local fish in danger of extinction
Environmental contamination affects local freshwater fish. Blocking rivers for hydro power projects, deforestation, sand mining and invading water sources by Mannawa (chiltalan ornata), and tank suddha (Ptrygoplichthus multriradiatus) that devour other fish are main threats to local fish.
Sri Lanka boasts 103 rivers 10,000 ponds, shallow lakes. mangrove lagoons and river mouth zones. Over 138 fresh water fish varieties thrive in them.
Ninety one fresh water fish varieties exist in these water sources. Over 23 brackish water fish varieties and 24 alien fish also exist in them.
NARDA sources said that around 50 indigenous fish species are found in our water sources.
Dankuda Pethiya (Dawakiniya Sri Lankansis) Pathirana Salaya (Devario Pathirana), Banduala Pethiya (Petiya Bandula) Mal Pulutta (Malpulutta Kretsiri) and another 16 varieties are in danger of extinction.
Bulath Hapaya (Pethiya Higrofasciata), Depulliya (Pethiya Umingi), Lay Tiththaya (Puntius Titeya), Wilpita Dhandiya (Rosboro Wilpita), Halmal Dhandiya (Rosboroidesvatrifloris) are also in danger of extinction. Fish Gadaya (Lebeo Fishery), Thambalaya (Lebeo Lanke) and Dhankuda Pethiya (Dewakinsiya Sri Lanakasis) are now limited to the Mahaweli river, the NARDA sources said.

New Zealand cricket team celebrate win with Bhangra Dance
After a close victory against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi, the New Zealand cricket team decided to celebrate their victory with a Bhangra dance.
The Kiwis beat the Men in Green by four runs in the first Test of their United Arab Emirates (UAE) tour at Abu Dhabi on November 19, 2018.
Consequently, the Black Caps celebrated in the dressing room with a little Punjabi MC.
This decadent dance appears to have been encouraged by the teams desi players, including left-arm-spinner Ajaz Patel, leg-spinner Ish Sodhi and leg-break bowler Jeet Raval.
The players can be seen singing, laughing and yes, doing Bhangra in their dressing room.
In the video two of the players can be seen, knees high at 90-degree angles, dancing buoyantly, with one, even drop squatting.
Some solid Bhangra moves to boot, the team were clearly running off the high of their recent victory in the Test Cricket match against strong competitors, the Pakistani cricket team.
Bhangra was originally a folk dance performed at harvest to celebrate the results of all the farmers hard-work.
It seems the New Zealand cricket team took a liking to the idea of performing Bhangra to celebrate the rewards of hard work.
Although the clip is short, the team members who did dance, gave their full vigour to this dance, Bhangra is not for the faint-hearted.
It involves a lot of core muscles as well as strength in the legs, all those drop squats need a good base.
So it was surprising to see how much energy the boys had after this match and their victory. Then again, with Bhangra anthem like Punjabi MCs track Mundiyan To Bach Ke (2003), its hard to resist the beat.
This song was brought to astronomical heights of success when rapper Jay Z remixed the track.
With over 20,000 views and over 1,500 likes, twitter seems to be loving this nod to Bhangra by the New Zealand cricket team.
The tweets came pouring in to celebrate New Zealands win, with Twitter showing excitement and appreciation of the Kiwis Bhangra performance.
Many congratulated the New Zealand team, meriting their hard work and skill, enjoying this visual display of joy and celebration in the form of Bhangra.
While another Twitter user highlighted how the team had been practising for this match in a tent filled with heaters that wafted hot air in as the players would practice.
This was to emulate the stifling and humid conditions of Abu Dhabi.
So it makes sense that after all that hard work, the guys wanted to blow off some steam with some Bhangra.
A particularly entertaining quote came from, @s_a_m_a_r_5 also known as Samar who put it simply: Three indian origin players in one team, Bhangra to Banta hai boss.
With three players of South Asian origin in this team, Bhangra was a fitting tribute to the teams success. The players this tweet refers to are Ajaz Patel, Ish Sodhi and Jeet Raval.
All of whom are players of the New Zealand cricket team, as such it was a nice touch to celebrate their victory in an inclusive way.
By giving a nod to these three players culture by doing Bhangra to celebrate the win the Kiwis highlighting sportsmanship in the best way.

No Speaker has ever challenged the Executive - Weerawansa
Since the Executive Presidency was established through the 1978 Constitution, no Speaker has ever taken it upon himself that he is the legislative authority and locked horns with the Executive, Minister Wimal Weerawansa, said.
He was addressing a media briefing in Parliament yesterday.
None of the previous Speakers arbitrarily challenged the decisions of the Executive and they never tried to show that they had the same powers as of the Executive, as current Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has done, Weerawansa said. Every former Speaker has acted by understanding their responsibilities and the powers vested with the Executive President appointed by the peoples mandate.
However, the current Speaker had taken on some unforeseen power upon himself and has been trying to create a conflict with the executive from the start of this issue.
President Maithripala Sirisena used his powers to appoint a new Prime Minister and Cabinet after the UPFA left the Unity Government and it ceased to exist, he said. This means that the post of Prime Minister too failed to exist. However, the Speaker has no right to challenge this decision taken by the President. The Constitution does not provide such powers to the Speaker. However, this Speaker, from the start opposed and challenged the Presidents decisions. He has become an ally of the TNA, JVP and UNP and is now challenging the President creating a clash between the Executive and the Legislative, laying a red carpet for external forces to interfere in Sri Lankas domestic affairs. He has met with several foreign diplomats who had acted against the country during the war, Weerawansa noted.
Minister Weerawansa charged that the Ranil, Anura, Sumanthiran clan is trying to create a volatile situation in the country to pave the way for these foreign forces to interfere.
When we met at 8.30 last morning, we tried to resolve this matter amicably, but the Speaker was adamant and refused to accept any suggestion except that of the Ranil, Sumantiran, Anura clan. That is why we left the Chamber without being part of that sinister move. If Karu Jayasuriya does not accept the Prime Minister and Cabinet of Ministers appointed by the President, then we will also not accept him as the Speaker. We are of the stand that his actions are illegal and unconstitutional and we walked out in protest against his actions. Under any circumstance, we will not change our stance if the Speaker remains adamant in his stand.
He said that the Speaker and UNF clan is trying to engage them in Parliament and create a clash. Therefore, he noted that the UPFA had taken the decision to walk out without being dragged into such a clash.
Leader of the House Dinesh Gunawardena explained the stand of the government and the UPFA walked out of the Chamber.

With income tax reduction from 28 percent to 14 percent
Five year tax exemption on agro industry
In order to promote agricultural production in the country for exports and consumption purposes, the government has decided to provide a 5 year tax exemption to agriculture based small and medium industries. In addition, the annual income tax rate on processing industries using local agricultural commodities are to be reduced from 28 per cent to 14 per cent.
Further, as measures to ease the serious hardships to small holder business operations, it is proposed to raise the threshold for the application of ESC Economic Service Charge from Rs. 12.5 million per quarter, to Rs.50 million per quarter.
These relief measures have been taken on the instructions of the President and the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs, are aimed at providing highest priority to agricultural development.
Accordingly, the government is of the view that every effort should be taken to make use of the 2018 /19 Maha cultivation season as a new beginning.
Therefore, agricultural income generated specially by small scale entrepreneurs in the cultivation of any agricultural produce such as tea, spices, coconut, rubber, paddy, fruits, vegetables, etc., are to be exempted from income taxation for a period of 5 years.
With the introduction of several changes to the tax system by the previous government, Sri Lankas business community, particularly the small and medium entrepreneurs, those engaged in professional and other services and agricultural activities, have been confronted with complex taxation and heavy tax burdens. In addition to the imposition of high income taxes on wage income and other remunerations, interest and rent incomes, tax burdens had also increased through high tax rates and reduction in tax free thresholds for the implementation of Value Added Tax (VAT), Nation Building Tax (NBT) Economic Services Charge (ESC), withholding taxes, etc. People are looking for a simple, broad based, low tax rates, a transparent tax system and a simplified tax administration. Such a system of taxation is important to provide an environment conducive for doing domestic business in the SME sector, professional and other services and agricultural activities. While formulating a simple tax system takes some time, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs, proposes at this stage to introduce some specific measures towards providing incentives that would enable SMEs and small sector business activities to revive rapidly.
Furthermore, the climate has become extremely favourable for full scale cultivation of agricultural crops in both the plantation sector as well as non-plantation agricultural activities such as paddy, grain, fruit and vegetables and as such, the government has already taken measures to reduce fertilizer prices, write off interest and penalties of agricultural credits and reduce income tax rates on agricultural income by such entrepreneurs.
The President and the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs are in complete agreement that the highest priority be given to agricultural development and accordingly, the government is of the view that every effort should be made to make use of the 2018 /19 Maha cultivation season as a new beginning to raise agricultural production in the country for exports such as tea, spices and other exportable crops as well as for domestic food consumption and for industrial raw materials. In this context, full scale cultivation using all cultivable land and increase in agricultural productivity to get maximum yields would be incentivised.
Therefore, following measures are proposed for implementation:
a. Agricultural income generated specially by small scale entrepreneurs in the cultivation of any agricultural produce such as tea, spices, coconut, rubber, paddy, fruits, vegetables, etc., to be exempted from income taxation for a period of 5 years.
b. Income tax rate and profit on processing industries using local agricultural commodities to be reduced from 28 percent to 14 percent.
These two proposals would encourage entrepreneurs in agriculture to engage in cultivation activities and increase the supply to local processing industries and improve the market supply for both export and domestic consumption. It also noted that several tea factories are operating below capacity as local production is not adequate and therefore it is important that tea production be increased as a priority.
c.The previous government has increased the ESC from 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent and reduced threshold level to Rs.12.5 million. This had imposed serious hardships to small holder business operations. Therefore, it is proposed to raise the threshold for the application of ESC from Rs. 12.5 million per quarter to Rs.50 million per quarter.
d Recognizing the priorities attached by this government to environmental friendly renewable energy sourced power generation, it is proposed that expenditure on the transition to renewable energy sources including the installation of solar panels, tea, rubber, coconut, rice and other agricultural processing factories be recognized as deductible expenses in the computation of taxable profits.
e.In view of the setbacks in economic activities during the past 3 years owing to sharp reduction in private sector credit facilities, high interest rate policies, high taxation at all levels, many entrepreneurs, particularly those who engaged in household level businesses and small and medium sized businesses, have not been able to service their borrowings from banking and financial institutions on a regular basis. As a result, not only the borrower, but also their guarantors have been listed as defaulters in the Credit Information Bureau (CRIB) which has led banks to curtail or suspend credit facilities to such borrowers and guarantors. It is in this background that the Economic Revival Package announced on November 1, 2018, included extending support to the farmers and small paddy millers by way of writing off the interest and penal interest on loans taken during the last 3 years, up to a maximum of Rs.50 million from commercial banks.
While accelerated support was provided to the agriculture sector enabling them to seize the good weather conditions, it is acknowledged that other sectors including Tea small holders, SMEs in construction, apparel, manufacturing, etc., are also faced with a situation in which their growth has been stymied with lack of access to markets, credit etc. In this context, the Treasury has already been directed to design a package that would support SME entrepreneurs in the short run to be able to access finance and revive their businesses.
f. As a relief to the consumers, taxes on Watana would be waived/removed by Rs. 10 per Kg. In addition, the government has already reduced fuel prices and taxes and prices of several other commodities, to reduce the cost of living, particularly, for low income families, according to a Statement by Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs.

UNF will form broad coalition:Dr. Senaratne
The UNF will form a broad coalition and its name and logo would be unveiled at an elaborate ceremony very soon, said UNP MP Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
He said so addressing a media briefing held in Parliament yesterday. We challenged the UPFA to show at least 85 in their favour, but they were unable to do so. By next week, we would show them a majority of over 122. Due to International pressure and internal pressure by intellectuals and the clergy, the government has fallen into immense trouble. Today, they were well behaved as they had no other choice. This is the first time that I have seen a government group walking out of Parliament. This is a historical victory, he said.
Meanwhile, MP Sajith Premadasa said that this illegal administration should be dissolved immediately. We have to bring in a Prime Minister and Government that has a majority in Parliament. We have to bring in stability and ensure that we have a diligent and conscientious approach to ensure social and economic prosperity to the people. That is of utmost importance. Every time a clock ticks, a modern time bomb is created and with its explosion, millions of Sri Lankans would be left destitute.
When questioned as to what solution the UNP had in order to resolve this crisis, Premadasa said so far no solution had been reached, but as a first step, the UNP had shown that they have the majority. He expressed hope that those taking decisions would have the intelligence and need to take proper decisions for the betterment of the country.

State Officers duty bound to carry out Govt. orders:Minister Gunawardena
Dharma Sri Abeyratne
Internal Trade and Investment Promotions Minister Bandula Gunawardena said that State officers are duty bound to carry out the orders and directives of the government.
State officers would not be affected by carrying out orders issued by the government when those officers work within the provisions of the Constitution, he added.
They will not be trapped by carrying out the orders of the government as they work within the provisions of the Constitution, he added.
Minister Gunawardena was addressing the media and government officers of the Import and Export Control Department in Colombo, yesterday.
He further said that ministers have been appointed under the provisions of the Constitution by the President. However, if there is any doubt about such appointments, anyone could go before the Supreme Court to get an interpretation concerning such ministerial appointments.
Addressing further, he refuted the allegation levelled by the Opposition that there was no Government nor Prime Minister and no Cabinet in the country.
If there is no government, we say that there wont be a parliament, he said.
Minister Gunawardena questioned as to who were responsible for the issues face by the government officers, if they do not carry out orders issued by the government.
If the Import and Export Controller does not carry out the orders of the minister, the Institute would collapse. Government officers would not fall pray by carrying out the orders of the responsible Minister who had been assigned within the provisions of the Constitution, the Minister added.

Pesticide subsidy to control Sena epidemic
The Government will grant a 50 per cent subsidy for pesticides to control spreading of crop-devastating caterpillar Sena (Fall Army Worm) reported from several districts, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Agriculture Department has recommended four pesticides to prevent the caterpillar from spreading and the government has allocated Rs. 50 million to spray the pesticides.
Minister Amaraweera has instructed Agricultural scientists to research and find out a biological method to fight the menace.
The Anuradhapaura, Ampara and Kurunegala districts are vastly affected with the pest.
Sena is a moth. It devours crops in its caterpillar stage of its lifecycle. It feeds on 100 crop varieties including paddy, sugarcane and vegetables and specially maize. Thousands of small-scale farmers are now in jeopardy because of the pest.
The Minister said the government will provide sufficient funds to control the epidemic.

Pogba fit as Mourinho reports clean bill of health for Man Utd
Manchester, Friday: Paul Pogba is fit for Manchester United's match against Crystal Palace on Saturday after recovering from a thigh injury that forced him out of the derby defeat and international duty with the French national team.
United manager Jose Mourinho was upbeat on Friday after his players returned from their national sides to prepare for the resumption of the Premier League campaign.
Luke Shaw will serve a one-match suspension against Palace after collecting five bookings and triggering a ban.
But Mourinho has a fully fit squad to choose from as United look to bounce back from a 3-1 defeat to Manchester City, a game that Pogba sat out with injury.
"With Paul, we knew with this break he would recover from that small muscular injury," Mourinho said on Friday.
"So we don't have players I can say are out of the game tomorrow. We have a huge 23 (man) group to choose for tomorrow."
United players appear to have managed their injuries through the international break successfully. Attacker Anthony Martial of France and midfielder Marouane Fellaini of Belgium did not join their national teams. Marcus Rashford has recovered from a minor muscular problem he suffered while playing for England against Croatia.
"Martial stayed with us, he didn't go to the national team," explained Mourinho. "The national team was aware of his problems and with permission he stayed, he worked really hard on that.
"I like to call that a 'pre-injury' because problems in the muscles around it, they are a dangerous situation and he was in a 'pre-injury' situation. He worked really hard, he's ready for tomorrow.
"Is he ready to play three in a row in the same week I don't know but the most important match is the next.
"Fellaini also stayed, no national team, they also let him stay in spite of playing 90 minutes against Man City. He needed to stay and prepare himself better after such an injury that he had before, so Marouane is also good.
"And the boys in the national teams -- Rashford came with a little problem but is ready, (Romelu) Lukaku is ready, I would say ready with a little bit of a risk but ready."
Buoyed by such good news, Mourinho has also repeated his claim that he believes United will be in a top-four position in the Premier League by the turn of the year.
United go into the weekend seven points behind fourth-placed Tottenham -- and with Arsenal, Bournemouth and Watford all standing between them and the top four -- although the manager remains defiant.
"I know," said Mourinho. "I know it's a big gap but I also know until the end of December, if I'm not wrong, we have eight Premier League matches to play.
"And eight Premier League matches we are speaking about 24 points, 24 points for us to fight for the other ones in the top four to fight too. But I believe we are going to be there." AFP

Police watch tribal island after missionarys killing
INDIA: Indian Police reinforcements on Friday took up position near the island where isolated tribal hunters killed an American missionary, though no effort was to be made to recover his body, officials said.
Hampered by restrictions on going to North Sentinel and the hostility of the Sentinelese people, Indian authorities are counting on the expertise of anthropologists and tribal welfare specialists to access the remains of 27-year-old John Allen Chau.
Chau was killed by arrows fired by the Sentinelese hunter-gatherers last week after he illegally went ashore in an apparent attempt to convert the tribe to Christianity.
Indian police have used a helicopter and a ship to get close to the protected island but failed to spot Chau's body or identify the place where he was killed.
To make the picture better and clearer another police team is being sent to the North Sentinel island waters, Dependra Pathak, Andamans chief of police, told AFP.
Seven people, including six fishermen, have been arrested for leading Chau to North Sentinel. Police hope the fishermen can give more clues to the place where he was slain.
Police have obtained seven days custody for three of the accused, Pathak said.
They will be interrogated on various aspects of the case including the sequence of events, the sea route followed for the island, the location where the victim landed, the place of incidence and location where Chau was last seen, he added. Foreigners and Indians are banned from going within five kilometres (three miles) of the island, to protect the Sentinelese, believed to number about 150, from outside disease.
While a murder case has been registered experts have discounted any possibility of action against the tribe for the death.
Indian authorities say Chau paid the fishermen to take him as close to the island as possible and then took his own kayak to North Sentinel.
It will also be ascertained whether the victim had taken the help of these fishermen or others to venture to the island on an earlier occasion, the police chief said.
Pathak said police will also take a new look at Chau's personal journal, in which he expressed fears that he might be killed.
He said he told the tribe after arriving: My name is John. I love you and Jesus loves you...Here is some fish! Fishermen saw the tribe burying his body on the beach the following day, another missionary wrote in an email to the dead man's mother, according to the Washington Post.
Recovering the body could take days, if it happens at all, as Indian authorities insist they cannot disturb the tribe or their habitat in the highly sensitive zone.

The tribe reportedly killed two fishermen whose boat drifted onto the island in 2006. They also fired arrows at a helicopter checking for damage after the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. - AFP

PUCSL briefing on Plugs and Sockets on Monday
A special discussion on National Standard for Plugs and Sockets (Non-Industrial Applications) themed Towards a Secure Electricity Usage Tomorrow will be held at the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration (SLIDA) Colombo 7, on Monday, November 26 from 9 am to 1.30 pm .
This discussion is organized by the Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL) with the support of Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), Lanka Electricity Company, Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI), Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA), Department of Import and Export, Sri Lanka Customs (SLC), and the Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL), who joined hands in introducing the national standard for plugs and sockets outlets in Sri Lanka in 2016.
The widespread use of substandard plugs, sockets, electrical equipment, adaptors (multi-sockets) and extension cords in the country has been a primary cause for the escalating number of electricity deaths and this national standard for plugs and socket outlets was introduced with the objective of reducing deaths by accidental electrocutions to at most 20 by 2020.
The PUCSL decided that the Type G plug and socket outlet (widely known as the 13 ampere plug and socket outlet, commonly referred to as the square pin plug and socket) to be the only national standard to be used in Sri Lanka and it is in force from January 1, 2018.
PUCSL Chairman Saliya Mathew, Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe, CEB Additional General Manager Chulanie Perera, SLSI Director General Dr. Siddhika G Senaratne, Customs Director General P. S. M. Charles, Import and Export Control Department Controller General Damayanthi Karunarathne, CAA Director General M. S. M.

Rai shreds course record to lead in Hong Kong
Hong Kong, Friday: There was high drama at the Hong Kong Open Friday as upstart Aaron Rai smashed the course record with a blistering nine-under-par 61, and Masters champion Patrick Reed birdied six of the final seven to avoid elimination.
England's Matt Fitzpatrick and Tommy Fleetwood and Spaniard Alvaro Quiros all found their form in calmer weather conditions to keep Rai within sight as they head into the weekend.
Beginning his round at the 11th hole, Rai, the world number 201, made four consecutive birdies from 12 to 15, and another five in total as he stayed bogey-free for the tournament.
The overnight co-leader opened up a four-stroke advantage at the top of the board over South Korea's Park Hyo-won, who also broke the previous course record with his 62.
Rai, who like Park is seeking his first win on the European Tour, improved on the record of 63 at the par-70 Fanling first shot by Chris Wood in 2012 and equalled by Lucas Bjerregaard in 2015, David Howell in 2016 and Miguel Angel Jimenez in 2017.
Fleetwood, the world number nine, made a charge with his 65 to lie eight shots off the pace, but afterwards he was full of praise for the 23-year-old Rai.
"It's great golf that... very, very impressive stuff. That's all I've got to say," said Fleetwood, who narrowly missed out winning his second Race to Dubai this month.
"I wish I could have watched it."
Rai thanked his local caddie, calling him a "great character" and saying he helped keep him calm.
Going into the weekend, a composed Rai said his tactics would be to stick "as close to the original game plan as possible".
"We were lucky today with the conditions," added Rai.
"We didn't have much wind and starting out pretty early, it was quiet for the first nine holes so it kind of feels like you're playing a round at home, which was nice."
Fitzpatrick carded 62 to keep up the pressure on the unheralded leaders, although was disappointed to come up short with a final putt that would have seen him equal Rai's new course record.
The USA's Micah Laurn Shin carded 67 to end seven off the lead.
Masters champion Reed had ended day one at five over par and looked likely to not make the cut on the second, after bogeying the eighth and tenth.
But coming back in, the American pulled out a gutsy performance, shooting six birdies over the final seven holes, drawing a huge cheer from the crowd after sinking the eighteenth to card 65.
Nine points off the lead and with 36 holes to go, Reed said he was not done yet.
"You can make birdies here in bunches," he said.
"I never feel like I'm ever out of a golf tournament."
Sergio Garcia, the Ryder Cup's all-time top points-scorer, carded 67 to lie 11 off the pace after a round sullied by bogeys on his final two holes.
"We'll need a really good weekend," the Spaniard said.
"I don't know if I'm building (into the tournament) or not. I'm tired, I'm looking forward to resting." AFP

Rain ruins India's bid to level Australia T20 series
Melbourne, Friday: India's bid to level their Twenty20 series with Australia was ruined by rain on Friday, with the match in Melbourne abandoned after the home team struggled to 132-7.
Australia won a nail-biting first match in Brisbane by four runs, with the third and final game in Sydney on Sunday. But the weather means India now can no longer win the series.
On a cold, grey day Australia were unable to build any meaningful partnerships with Ben McDermott their top scorer on 32 before the heavens opened and they forced off after 19 overs.
Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Khaleel Ahmed took two wickets each.
Several attempts were made to restart the game, with the covers coming off and then going on again before the umpires finally called it off.
The win in Brisbane had been a confidence-booster for an Australian team that have only won six of their last 23 internationals.
They were hoping to keep the momentum going but got off to the worst possible start after Virat Kohli won the toss and put them into bat in front of a boisterous 65,000-strong crowd.
Aaron Finch was out first ball, with the Australian skipper edging a Kumar delivery to Rishabh Pant behind the wicket who took a simple catch.
The explosive Chris Lynn began swinging his bat soon after coming in, including a trademark six, but he didn't last long and sliced a ball to deep point where he was comfortably caught by Krunal Pandya.
It left Australia in trouble at 27-2 after four overs and it got worse when D'Arcy Short chopped a ball onto his wicket from Ahmed. He was gone for 14 and Marcus Stoinis then fell for four.
Glenn Maxwell, who plundered an impressive 46 in the first match in Brisbane, looked in good early nick but he couldn't repeat his antics and was bowled by Pandya for 19.
Australia's batsmen were making poor shot choices and couldn't get a partnership going with Alex Carey the next to depart, caught by Pandya off spinner Kuldeep Yadav as he went for a big hit.
Nathan Coulter-Nile, in the team at short notice after paceman Billy Stanlake turned an ankle in the warm-up, smacked a huge six off the first ball he faced and got another before he too was out.
Alex Tye joined McDermott in a cameo to add some desperately-needed late runs before rain forced them off with an over left. AFP

Ranil tells UNF MPs:
Refrain from making statements on Court cases
As none of us can presume or express our personal views in respect of cases pending before the Supreme Court or in other courts, UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesighe yesterday (23) strongly advised the UNF MPs to refrain from giving statements pertaining to cases pending before Courts.
We need not express our views pertaining to cases pending either before the Supreme Court or the other Judicial Bodies. We cannot presume or make foregone conclusions as to what type of judgement would be delivered. The Supreme Court would deliver its judgement at the proper time. We also cannot say how the Bench is comprised, whether it is of three or five or nine Judges, to deliver the judgement. In respect of the Supreme Court judgement, we cannot say beforehand whether the judicial pronouncement of the Supreme Court is going to be unanimous or division Bench decision, Wickremesinghe said.
He went on to say that the UNP has submitted its petition.
We have submitted our petition in respect of the Constitutional crisis and we cannot say whether the Supreme Court is going to allow our plea or refuse it.
Having submitted our petition, we expected a temporary release and we got it. We can only wish that at the end of the case in toto, that we would get permanent relief.
But if you think you want to go beyond mere wishing for the success of the case, then conduct Bodhi Poojas, take part in religious activities and avoid making statements, in respect of matters of this nature:, the UNP leader told the UNF members.

Relief for the masses
One of the biggest blunders done by the previous Government was heaping burden upon burden on the people, who were already hard hit by the high Cost of Living. Former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe waxed eloquent about making Sri Lanka another Singapore by 2040, neglecting the day-to-day travails of people who were struggling to survive. He even offered free Wi-Fi to people who could not afford two square meals per day. Worse, there was a so-called fuel pricing formula that dumbfounded even the brightest mathematicians and economists in the country  the only thing most people knew was that fuel prices went up by Rs.10 every month.
Long term plans are necessary, but not at the expense of the everyday concerns and difficulties of the people. This naturally alienated the Government from the masses, who were yearning for a change. It is into this vacuum that President Maithripala Sirisena stepped in, to change the status quo by appointing former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister. It is well known that Prime Minister Rajapaksa feels the pulse of the people. Wearing his other hat as the Finance Minister, the Prime Minister has already reduced fuel prices twice and given many other concessions to the people.
Now the Government has announced that under the guidance of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, it will introduce a relief package to help the people affected by the poor financial management and policies of the previous UNP government. The Finance Minister will implement the package aiming to ease the peoples burdens while strengthening the countrys moribund economy.
An alarming feature of the previous administration was its almost total neglect of the agricultural sector. Prime Minister Rajapaksa told a gathering on Thursday that this may have been done at the behest of the multilateral lending agencies, which usually have other agendas for emerging economies. Thus they did little to develop the sector, other than blame the drought that prevailed in some areas.
Agriculture is the lifeblood of the economy, with nearly half of the countrys population dependent on it in some way. A Government ignores agriculture at its peril. In a symbolic gesture, on the very day after the change of Government, President Sirisena participated in the Vap Magula ceremony signifying the new Governments commitment to agriculture.
More attention will now be drawn to strengthen the agriculture sector. The sector will receive tax concessions and other incentives. As an example, Prime Minister Rajapaksa as Finance Minister has submitted a proposal to do away with the 14 per cent tax imposed on agricultural products, for a period of five years. Accordingly, the Government will take immediate steps to remove the 14 per cent tax imposed on profit earned from selling agro products.
This is a very good move. More concessions are apparently on the way. But there are a few problems that have to be addressed by the authorities. Sometimes there is a glut of certain crops such as big onions and even paddy in certain harvesting seasons, which leads to a situation where the farmer is unable to sell the excess quantities at any price. This leads to a massive waste of food products, not to mention a huge loss of revenue for the farmers.
In this context, the Government should address Post Harvest Losses (PHL) which can sometimes amount to more than 40 percent of the total harvest. A huge quantity of food is wasted in handling, transport and storage  it is vital to perfect strategies to prevent this. We still do not have mechanisms for the storage and preservation of food items other than paddy. Such mechanisms will help prevent PHL. Moreover, we must find export markets for our excess food products.
The export sector was another sector affected by the narrow sighted unsystematic monetary decisions made by the previous government. The sector was heavily taxed, which led to the loss of our exporters competitive advantage in terms of world trade. With economists predicting that Sri Lanka has the potential of reaching a US$ 50 billion export target in the medium term, the sector definitely deserves all the incentives and concessions that the Government can provide. Some of the best economies in Asia including China and Singapore are leading exporters. In fact, improving local production (primarily agriculture and industry) and exports is one of the main time tested development strategies all over the world.
The economy was badly affected during the last three years, beginning with the massive Bond Scam. Economic growth has come down to its lowest levels in recent years, along with the disastrous fall of the Sri Lanka Rupee, which this Government is trying to reverse. The stock market too was not performing well. However, there are no overnight solutions to longstanding economic woes and people should not expect quick miracles. But from what we can see so far, the economy is in good hands. Even at the height of the war under then President Rajapaksa, the Rupee was stable and economic growth was quite respectable. There is no doubt that this can happen again.

From Shaolin temple to MMA star - meet China's 'Monkey King'
Beijing, Friday: Song Yadong was so obsessed with Chinese martial arts that he convinced him mother to pack him up and send him off to learn at the feet of the famous kung fu masters of Shaolin.
He was just nine years old at the time.
"I had watched a lot of kung fu movies, so I wanted to be like my heroes, like Jet Li," said Song. "I went to Shaolin and I trained, getting up each day at 5am. It was harder than I ever expected."
A decade later and Song's thirst for action has led him into the ranks of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and on to the biggest stage in mixed martial arts.
"I left Shaolin after two years and then I learned about MMA," said the 20-year-old. "I like the action, I like the fact every fight tests you and that you always have to work to be the best fighter you can be."
Song is at the forefront of the Las Vegas-based promotion's push into China, the country many consider the spiritual home of all martial arts, and the Tianjin-born fighter is among nine locals set to take part in the UFC's first fight card to be held in the Chinese capital.
Saturday night sees the UFC Fight Night 141 event at Beijing's Cadillac Arena, headlined by a blockbuster bout between heavyweight contenders in Cameroonian-Frenchman Francis "The Predator" Ngannou (11-3) and American Curtis "Razor" Blaydes.
But there's little doubt where Chinese fans' attention - and hopes - will rest.
"It will be the biggest chance for us Chinese fighters and for the sport to grow in China," said Song, who will face American Vince "Vandetta" Morales on Saturday night.
Song's rise to the UFC has captured China's attention, as has the origin story he carries with him.
When he was 15, Song was so focused on becoming a professional MMA fighter that he used a forged ID card to convince local promotions that he was 18, and legally allowed to fight.
"I was super-aggressive back then," said Song. "I just wanted to fight so I used the fake ID. I looked strong enough so they believed me."
After plying his trade in domestic and regional fight promotions - and racking up a fight record of 10 wins and three losses - Song received a surprise call last November, just weeks before the UFC was set to make its debut in mainland China.
Called in to replace an injured fighter on the UFC Fight Night 122 card, Song needed just over four minutes to choke out India's Bharat Khandare. He's since backed up that performance with a second-round knockout of the Brazilian veteran Filipe Arantes in Singapore in June, and so comes to Beijing on a 2-0 run and with a 12-3 win-loss record overall.
"There is still a lot of room for improvement in my skills," said Song. "I am focused on winning step by step, fight by fight. I have been training with (UFC Hall of Famer) Urijah Faber and his Team Alpha Male in California and I am learning.
"Chinese fighters need more experience but soon we will be a force."
The UFC currently has 11 Chinese fighters on its books, a mix of established stars such as the veteran welterweight Li "The Leech" Jingliang and rising stars such as Song and female strawweight Zhang Weili, with all three in action on Saturday.
This week the organisation announced an investment of around $13 million in what it called the world's biggest MMA academy in Shanghai, designed to help Chinese fighters make the transition from smaller fight promotions to the UFC octagon.
Song has recently replaced "The Terminator" as his fight name with "The Monkey King", in reference to the mythical Chinese hero Sun Wukong.
He believes China's rich history in martial arts has the country - and its fighters - well positioned as MMA continues to take hold.
"We have the history in China," said Song. "This is only the beginning." AFP

Speaker Karu Jayasuriyas adamant actions is leading the country into anarchy by totally violating the Standing Orders of Parliament.
However, through such actions, they cannot take back the Premiership nor the government and we as the UPFA government will continue our work unhindered, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
Addressing a media conference at the Parliamentary complex yesterday, he urged Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to stop acting in this adamant manner and take a neutral stance and serve the country.
If they want to show the majority, they should appoint the committee of selections in the proper manner, appoint the business committee and thereafter bring a no confidence resolution to parliament in the proper manner. If we lose that then we will not remain, we will leave.
At the Party Leaders meeting Rauff Hakeem spilled the beans and said that they had taken a short cut for fear that parliament would be prorogued.
Hence, it is clear that they themselves have accepted that this system is wrong.
Therefore, they cannot throw out the Prime Minister and government that was appointed legitimately by the President.
If they want to they should show their majority according to proper procedures, he said.

Stop biodiversity loss or we could face our own extinction, warns UN
The world has two years to secure a deal for nature to halt a silent killer as dangerous as climate change, says biodiversity chief.
The world must thrash out a new deal for nature in the next two years or humanity could be the first species to document our own extinction, warns the United Nations biodiversity chief.
Ahead of a key international conference to discuss the collapse of ecosystems, Cristiana Pasca Palmer said people in all countries need to put pressure on their governments to draw up ambitious global targets by 2020 to protect the insects, birds, plants and mammals that are vital for global food production, clean water and carbon sequestration.
What is biodiversity and why does it matter
Biodiversity describes the rich diversity of life on Earth, from individual species to entire ecosystems. The term was coined in 1985  a contraction of biological diversity  but the huge global biodiversity losses now becoming apparent represent a crisis equalling and quite possibly surpassing climate change. Deforestation, poaching, industrial farming and pollution are some of the ways in which the planet's natural ecosystem is being disrupted  with devastating results.
The loss of biodiversity is a silent killer, she told the Guardian. Its different from climate change, where people feel the impact in everyday life. With biodiversity, it is not so clear but by the time you feel what is happening, it may be too late.
Pasca Palmer is executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity  the world body responsible for maintaining the natural life support systems on which humanity depends.
Its members  195 states and the EU  will meet in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, this month to start discussions on a new framework for managing the worlds ecosystems and wildlife. This will kick off two years of frenetic negotiations, which Pasca Palmer hopes will culminate in an ambitious new global deal at the next conference in Beijing in 2020.
Conservationists are desperate for a biodiversity accord that will carry the same weight as the Paris climate agreement. But so far, this subject has received miserably little attention even though many scientists say it poses at least an equal threat to humanity.
The last two major biodiversity agreements  in 2002 and 2010  have failed to stem the worst loss of life on Earth since the demise of the dinosaurs.
Eight years ago, under the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, nations promised to at least halve the loss of natural habitats, ensure sustainable fishing in all waters, and expand nature reserves from 10% to 17% of the worlds land by 2020. But many nations have fallen behind, and those that have created more protected areas have done little to police them. Paper reserves can now be found from Brazil to China.
The issue is also low on the political agenda. Compared to climate summits, few heads of state attend biodiversity talks. Even before Donald Trump, the US refused to ratify the treaty and only sends an observer. Along with the Vatican, it is the only UN state not to participate.
Glimmers of hope
Pasca Palmer says there are glimmers of hope. Several species in Africa and Asia have recovered (though most are in decline) and forest cover in Asia has increased by 2.5% (though it has decreased elsewhere at a faster rate). Marine protected areas have also widened.
But overall, she says, the picture is worrying. The already high rates of biodiversity loss from habitat destruction, chemical pollution and invasive species will accelerate in the coming 30 years as a result of climate change and growing human populations. By 2050, Africa is expected to lose 50% of its birds and mammals, and Asian fisheries to completely collapse. The loss of plants and sea life will reduce the Earths ability to absorb carbon, creating a vicious cycle.
The numbers are staggering, says the former Romanian environment minister. I hope we arent the first species to document our own extinction.
Despite the weak government response to such an existential threat, she said her optimism about what she called the infrastructure of life was undimmed.
One cause for hope was a convergence of scientific concerns and growing interest from the business community. Last month, the UNs top climate and biodiversity institutions and scientists held their first joint meeting. They found that nature-based solutions  such as forest protection, tree planting, land restoration and soil management  could provide up to a third of the carbon absorption needed to keep global warming within the Paris agreement parameters. In future the two UN arms of climate and biodiversity should issue joint assessments.
She also noted that although politics in some countries were moving in the wrong direction, there were also positive developments such as French president, Emmanuel Macron, recently being the first world leader to note that the climate issue cannot be solved without a halt in biodiversity loss. This will be on the agenda of the next G7 summit in France.
Things are moving. There is a lot of goodwill, she said. We should be aware of the dangers but not paralysed by inaction. Its still in our hands but the window for action is narrowing. We need higher levels of political and citizen will to support nature.

Trump all for Saudis, despite Khashoggi killing expose
President Donald Trump is facing strong criticism and a possible conflict with Congress over his firm support for Saudi Arabian authorities, disregarding the reported links of the Crown Prince Bin Salman to the attack on the Saudi journalist killing Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Turkey in October this year.
This has been a week of turmoil for President Trump with strong reports that the American Intelligence Agency, the CIA, had concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBN) had ordered the assassination of Khashoggi, and the Presidents determination to consider MBN free of any such charges. He has taken his slogan of America First against the consideration of proper justice, and possibly major sanctions against Saudi Arabia on the Khashoggi killing.
In a personal statement on the latest situation on this killing, Trump saw the importance of Saudi Arabia in the campaign against Iran in the Middle East. He held Iran responsible for the bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, when the Saudi role in the attacks on Yemen is being condemned worldwide. Trump said Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism.
His statement said that King Salman and Crown Prince MBS vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Khashoggi. US intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event  maybe he did and maybe he didn't!
He added that, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!
Meanwhile, the situation is leading to a conflict with the Congress, where the Democrats have a majority in the House of Representatives, and several US Senators, including Republicans, are also strongly critical of Trumps support of the Saudis, despite the killing of Khashoggi. There is an increased call for an immediate cutoff in U.S. support for Saudi military operations in Yemen and a suspension in U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia.
Sen. Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticized Trump for his response to the Khashoggi killing, stating, The Presidents failure to hold Saudi Arabia responsible in any meaningful way for the death of Jamal Khashoggi is just one more example of this White Houses retreat from Americas leadership on issues like human rights and protecting the free press.
After Trumps statement, Sen. Dianne Feinstein said she would withhold support for Saudi Arabia and urged U.S sanctions on Saudi Arabia. She said she would not vote for any future weapons sales or appropriations for Saudi Arabia, shocked that Trump would not punish Saudi Arabias crown prince for the premeditated murder of Khashoggi, a U.S resident.
Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden said that Trump had made it clear that he does not care who ordered the brutal murder of Khashoggi.
Interestingly, Trump's statement comes two weeks before the Saudi-led OPEC oil cartel meets with Russia and other producers to set a global oil policy. The allied exporters are widely expected to cut output following a severe pullback in oil prices.
Trump recently urged Saudi Arabia and OPEC against throttling back production, a move that would boost oil prices. His statement makes clear that Saudi oil production was a factor in his decision. After the U.S, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world, the statement reads. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels  so important for the world. Trump wants to keep oil prices down to help his internal economic policies. But, will this be followed by OPEC Trump has made it clear in his statement that his position on the Khashoggi killing is based on his America First policy; with no interest in US policies on Human Rights and Media Freedom.
Trump is also angered by a California Federal Court decision against attempts to stop persons entering the US through irregular entry points and seeking asylum in the country. This goes against Trumps moves to send American troops and other security services to the southern border with Mexico, to stop the entry of anyone from what is described as The Caravan of would be asylum seekers, nearly 7,000, coming from Honduras, Nicaragua and San Salvador, through Mexico, seeking asylum in the US, due to the poverty, political clashes, and internal strife in these countries. Trump has labelled them as invaders.
Brexit and May
Although the Draft Agreement between the UK and the European Union, which Theresa May says is right for the whole of the UK, has been accepted by the EU, it has been a shocking week in the UK for Theresa May, with strong opposition to this finalized deal with the EU, over Brexit. The attacks on May came from the left and right, from the Conservatives (Tories) and Labour, and also the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) of Northern Ireland, on which she depends for a Commons majority. She lost two ministers from the Cabinet and saw several other Tory resignations too. There were moves to have a motion of no confidence in her as the Tory party leader, but this subsided, as she renewed negotiations with the EU, and rushed to Brussels, in what is seen as a desperate publicity drive.
The situation remains tough for Theresa May, who has pushed the Brexit deal very hard through the past two years. The challenge to her leadership among the Tories remains, which can rise again if she cannot push the deal through the Commons, which seems very difficult today.
Apart from the problems in the UK, there are also objections and opposition to some aspects of the deal, especially coming from Spain over the handling of Gibraltar, a former Spanish terrain that remains under the British Crown. The people of Gibraltar are very much involved with EU policies. The Spanish Prime Minister has threatened to vote against the deal at the EU.
Although the EU has so far publicly stressed its unity in dealings with the UK, it is understood that some other member countries too have problems with the future relationship proposals  fearing too many concessions that may have been granted to Mays government.
The countries understood to have voiced concerns in private include Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands, who were annoyed that the UK was given an EU customs union as part of the backstop, without a formal agreement guaranteeing they retain fishing rights on British waters.
France has reportedly joined with those countries to push for stronger demands on that issue and on guaranteeing the UK cannot roll back on environmental, social, and labour standards.
These objections could also lead to reopening talks on the agreement and its interpretations, which is not acceptable to Theresa Mays critics in the UK. She also has to ensure that Ireland is not opposed to any such renewed negotiations.
With all the hasty and even desperate negotiations with the EU, the main problem is, can she get through the final deal in the House of Commons. Just now it seems most unlikely. It is Theresa Mays biggest challenge lying ahead.
Interpol
After Meng Hongwei, the Chinese head of Interpol, who is now held in detention in China on allegations of accepting bribes, Interpol this week chose South Koreas Kim Jong-yang as its new president.
The moves to elect the new head of Interpol- the global police body - unnerved western countries, as there was the possibility of the new president being the Russian candidate, Alexander Prokopchuk -- a Russian interior ministry official and current Interpol vice president. This was over alleged fears that Moscow could abuse the role to target political opponents. With the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo throwing his weight behind the South Korean Kim, he will now serve the remainder of Chinas Mengs term till 2020. The concerns about the choice of the Russian candidate was over previous applications for Interpol  Red Notices or international arrest warrants, to allegedly target those who had fallen foul of the Kremlin leadership.
There was strong objection to the Russian candidate from the US and UK, and also anti-Kremlin figures in Russia, including Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader who has been repeatedly jailed by authorities. The selection of the South Korean Kim has wider acceptance the world over.

West Indies' Gabriel banned for second Bangladesh Test
CHITTAGONG, Friday - West Indies fast bowler Shannon Gabriel was suspended for next week's second Test against Bangladesh after he accumulated five demerit points within a 24-month period for disciplinary breaches, the International Cricket Council said on Friday.
Gabriel was handed two demerit points after he was found guilty of shoulder barging Bangladesh's Imrul Kayes during the opening day of the first Test between the two teams in Chittagong on Thursday.
The incident took place in the eighth over of the Test when, after bowling a delivery, Gabriel was judged to have made deliberate physical contact with batsman Imrul on his follow through.
"In the opinion of the umpires, this physical contact was avoidable," the ICC said in a statement.
Gabriel had received three demerit points during the Jamaica Test against Pakistan in April 2017, when he was also fined 50 per cent of his match fee.
With the addition of two demerit points, he has reached the threshold of four demerit points, which have now been converted into two suspension points.
As two suspension points equate to a ban from one Test or two ODIs or two T20Is, whichever comes first, Gabriel has been suspended from the second Test, which will be played in Dhaka from November 30 to December 4.
Gabriel was also fined 30 per cent of his match fee for Thursday's incident.
His suspension came as a blow for West Indies as Gabriel was the pick of their bowlers with 4-70 in the first innings of the ongoing Test.

Windies hit back after Bangladesh teen sets record
CHITTAGONG Nov 23: Teenage Bangladesh off-spinner Nayeem Hasan became the youngest ever player to take five wickets on debut but West Indies spinners matched him to restore parity in the first Test in Chittagong on Friday.
Nayeem, who was 17 years 355 days old at the start of the game, finished with 5-61, as Bangladesh bowled out the West Indies for 246 to take a 78-run first innings lead.
But the hosts were unable to cash in on the advantage, slumping to 55 for five in their second innings at stumps on the second day for a lead of just 133 runs.
Jomel Warrican and Roston Chase each took two wickets to help the West Indies claw their way back into the contest.
Mushfiqur Rahim remained unbeaten on 11 alongside Mehidy Hasan, on what looked like a batting minefield at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium.
Nayeem, who surpassed Australian Pat Cumminss five-wicket haul on debut at 18 years and 193 days, took care of the West Indies lower middle-order after senior spinners provided the initial breakthroughs.
Skipper Shakib Al Hasan, who finished with 3-43, dismissed Shai Hope and Kraigg Brathwaite at the start of his spell after Taijul Islam removed Kieran Powell for 14 to help the hosts reduce West Indies to 31-3.
Roston Chase and Sunil Ambris tried to rebuild the innings but Nayeem soon struck, removing both batsmen in successive overs for 31 and 19 runs respectively. Shimron Hetmyer then launched a counter-attack to score 63 off 47 balls with five fours and four sixes for a brief respite from the spin onslaught.
Hetmyer shared 92 runs with Shane Dowrich to lift West Indies from a precarious 88-5 but the side collapsed again once Mehidy broke the stand.
Nayeem then dismissed Devendra Bishoo, Kemar Roach and Warrican to complete his five-for before Sakib removed Shannon Gabriel to wrap up the West Indies innings.
Dowrich held one end firm to stay unbeaten on 63, his third Test fifty which came off 101 balls with the help of two fours and three sixes.
Earlier in the day, Bangladesh were bowled out quickly for 324 in their first innings after resuming on their overnight score of 315-8.

Sri Lanka must prevent use of biological agents, Sri Lanka Permanent Representative in Geneva Ambassador A.L.A. Azeez said.
He was addressing the International Seminar convened by the Geneva Centre for Security Policy (GCSP) and the Implementation Support Unit (ISU) of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) on 'the importance of disease surveillance and alert mechanisms: lessons for the BWCon November 20.
The Seminar focused on the Article 7 of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) that accentuates the importance of technical assistance and international cooperation to respond effectively to epidemics involving bio-agents.
Ambassador Azeez explained the existing disease surveillance mechanism in Sri Lanka. He said it comprises a wide range of medical and administrative networks including at national, provincial, and district levels. He also drew attention to the role and contribution of hospitals and primary healthcare units in addressing the challenge.
Continuing work on strengthening the system involved further updating of policies and programmes to empower the National Disease Surveillance System is a part of an integrated health-security mechanism, he said.
He said Sri Lanka has an exemplary platform which could be further built on to be more effective in meeting new and emerging challenges and unanticipated outbreaks of epidemics, with the active support of all stakeholders.
The need for a web-based surveillance system that facilitates heightened surveillance by integrating hospitals at all levels and effective pursuit of a meaningful public-private partnership, which could enhance the feeding of data into the central database, was highlighted at this forum. It would go a long way in ensuring efficacious responses to future challenges.
WHO scientist Prof. Maurizio Barbeschi appreciated Sri Lankas system of disease surveillance, It provided an appropriate base to be further worked on as a model, he said.
Health Security experts representing Japan, Russia and South Korea, and regional and international organisations and the private sector made presentations on the varied aspects of disease surveillance.

Sri Lanka left to rue early use of DRS
Bairstow comeback century helps England pass 300 for fourth time
England gave further demonstration of their dominance over the Sri Lankan spinners when on a dry turning track they displayed a technique that was successful in encountering spin so that by the end of the opening day of the third and final cricket Test at the SSC grounds they were strongly placed at 312 for seven wickets by stumps.
It is the fourth time in five innings in the series that England has passed the 300-run mark and the way the Lankan batters have performed against the England spinners so far the total looks more than sufficient for them to go ahead and complete a 3-0 whitewash.
At the wickets are two spinners who can bat and cause further damage to Sri Lanka  Moeen Ali on 23 and Adil Rashid on 13, by extending that total to one of match-winning proportions.
Moeen in the 74 minutes he was at the wicket had a charming life being dropped behind the wicket by Niroshan Dickwell at 2 off Lakshan Sandakan and in the slips by Dimuth Karunaratne at 17 and then successfully reviewing two lbw decisions against him at 19 and 23  all of them off the luckless Dilruwan Perera who ended the day with expensive figures of one for 107 off 30.1 overs.
Sri Lanka only made things difficult for themselves by exhausting their two reviews as early as the 22nd over with England on 82-2 for after that they were at the mercy of the umpire to have a decision given in their favour.
Ben Stokes who went onto score 57 off 88 balls (5 fours, 2 sixes) survived two lbw decisions at 0 and 26 which the umpire negatived but on replay was out with the ball clearly hitting the stumps. However Sri Lankas poor judgement of calling for the DRS and exhausting it so early cost them wickets as they were to later rue.
Sri Lankas bad luck with the toss continued as Joe Root won it for the third time in a row in the series and had no hesitation in choosing to bat first as they had done so in the first two Tests and won so convincingly by 211 runs and by 57 runs at Galle and Pallekele respectively to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the series.
In each of the two Tests England had a centurion  Ben Foakes and Keaton Jennings at Galle, and Joe Root at Pallakele.
Yesterday it was Jonny Bairstows turn to take the limelight when he became Englands fourth centurion in the series stroking his way to a remarkable century  110 off 186 balls with nine fours and a six.
Root had given a pre-warning of what Bairstow could do when he has a point to prove at the pre-match press conference. The England wicket-keeper who lost his place in the series to Ben Foakes due to an ankle injury, came out with all guns blazing to prove a point and by doing so may have solved Englands teething problem of finding a permanent no. 3. Moeen Ali was tried out in the first Test and Ben Stoakes in the second without much success.
One thing we all know about Jonny is that whenever hes got a point to prove, or he is up against it, he generally comes out and does something pretty special. Hopefully we see that determination and drive to really hammer that spot (n. 3) home for himself this week, said Root.
And so it was as Bairstow went onto complete his sixth Test hundred and his third against Sri Lanka in four Tests stitching together partnerships of 100 with Root (46) and 99 with Stokes (57) that laid the foundation for Englands total.
Although Sri Lanka kept on chipping in with wickets England scored freely maintaining a run rate of between 3 and four an over.
Lakshan Sandakan playing his first match of the series ended up as the pick of the Lankan bowlers with figures of four for 91.
Both teams made two changes with Sandakan and Dhanushka Gunathilaka replacing Akila Dananjaya and Kaushal Silva for Sri Lanka and, Stuart Broad and Jonny Bairstow coming in for James Anderson and Sam Curran.

Bairstow lets emotions run high in century celebrations
Jonny Bairstow let his emotions get the better of him when he completed his sixth Test century on his comeback from injury on the first day of the third and final Test against Sri Lanka at the SSC yesterday.
An ankle injury while playing football during a warm-up saw Bairstow miss the first two Tests of the series and lose his place as wicket-keeper to Ben Foakes.
Bairstow having recovered from the injury was included for the third Test but not as wicket-keeper but to fill in the problematic no. 3 batting spot for England.
The red-haired Yorkshireman obliged by scoring 110 off 186 balls to see England to a first day total of 312-7.
I was obviously pleased with it. Theres only a few times you get to score a hundred for England, so its a special time to be out there in the middle, said Bairstow at the end of the day.
The emotion and hard work that has gone into getting back out on the field is massive. Its the hard work you put in behind the scenes that no one sees. The sleeping on ice machines, the rehab you put in. It would have been quite easy to say Im not fit. That injury potentially rules you out for 6-8 weeks. You potentially just say Im content being not fit for six weeks.
Thats the bit that means the most out there...the days when things arent going well, for your mates back home that make sure everythings okay. You could quite easily take your bat home for whatevers gone on but putting things in perspective and what have you over the last couple of weeks has been massive, he said.
On making the number three position his own Bairstow said, Long term who knows whats going to happen. In the last year I think Ive batted at 7, 6, 5, 4 and 3. Who knows whats going to happen long term. Im happy with my performance today. You look at
challenges along the way and you try and take them in a positive way. Id like to think todays innings was taken in that way.
SANDAKAN DEFENDS WASTING OF DRS
Sri Lankas left-arm spinner Lakshan Sandakan defended his teams exhausting the DRS as early as the 22nd over that left them without any reviews and cost them a few of Englands wickets later in the day.
The DRS we take with the intention of making a breakthrough. Even if the reviews had not been exhausted we would have taken that at some other point. It was a collective decision and we cannot pinpoint fingers at anyone, said Sandakan.
Sri Lanka could have dismissed Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali cheaply had they used the DRS wisely. Stokes survived lbw decisions at 0 and 26 to score 57 and Ali at 19 and 23 to be 23 not out by the close.
Sandakan playing his first match of the series said that he was pleased to contribute on a good SSC pitch.
Its unfortunate Akila (Dananjaya) had to miss out. Glad I was able to contribute. It is a good wicket. The ball turns. I feel that in a day or two it will help the bowlers more. So far it is even for all, said Sandakan.
The wicket was good for batting and they didnt take too many risks. They played some good shots than reverse sweeps. It is easy for batsmen as the ball doesnt turn too much. Coming back after an injury I thought Bairstow batted superbly, he said.
Sandakan who was undergoing some technical changes to his bowling was forced to play in this Test because of the absence of Dananjaya who has gone to Brisbane to have his bowling action reassessed after it was reported.
I had a small error in my bowling arm and Piyal Wijetunga the spin bowling coach and the head coach took some corrective measures to rectify it, Sandakan said.

Bellew confirms retirement from boxing
London, Friday: Former world cruiserweight champion Tony Bellew has confirmed his retirement from boxing, two weeks after his defeat by Oleksandr Usyk meant he failed in his bid to unify the division.
Britain's Bellew, 35, posted a video on social media to officially announce that he was hanging up his gloves.
"It is time for me to finally leave the ring, the bell has rung for the final time and I want to thank you all for the support you have given me over the years," Bellew said on Twitter.
"Today I am announcing that I am officially retired, there will be no more fighting. The only thing you will see me doing from here on in is trying to act sensible and behave myself."
Bellew, who won 30 of his 34 fights, including two at heavyweight against David Haye, said his greatest achievement was beating Ilunga Makabu in 2016 to win the WBC cruiserweight title.
When asked what might tempt him out of retirement, Bellew joked: "Eddie (Hearn) gets 100 million ($128 million) together for me and offers me one more fight, what do I say Wow, wow -- that is probably what I would say.
"Wow, wow and then walk into the missus and say 'Eddie has come on board with 100 million' and she would probably hand me divorce papers. Money is good but money comes and goes, that is the best way of saying it."

The country would have been ruined if the UNP was in power for another year, said Co-operatives Minister Johnston Fernando.
He was speaking at a meeting of voters in the Divulapitiya electorate at Marandagahamula, yesterday.
The economy has collapsed due to the plundering of public funds at the Central Bank under UNP leadership, he said. I was kept in remand custody for 44 and 29 days respectively to take revenge from me. All family members of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa were meaninglessly harassed by putting them in jail during the past several years. Several ministers, parliamentarians and members of the Buddhist clergy were kept in remand custody to take political revenge, the minister said.
If the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister is unlawful, UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe should file a case in the Supreme Court against that decision.
He never did that as he knows that the appointments by the President are lawful and in accordance with the Constitution, Minister Fernando said.
If the UNP is confident that they have the will of the people to rule the country, why do the leaders of the UNP fear General Elections The UNP has been postponing elections for years depriving the rights of voters. Therefore, the UNP is not a democratic political party.
The only available solution to the present political situation is to hold General Elections soon to allow people to elect their peoples representatives, said the minister.

A Day of Discovery: Royal Colombo Golf Club scouts for fresh talent
The Junior Clinic of the Royal Colombo Golf Club (RCGC) will host A Day of Discovery event to identify new golfing talent on December 10. With this program, RCGC hopes to recruit a fresh pool of budding young golfers to its existing junior clinic outreach program, which was initiated in 2011 to help the game thrive in Sri Lanka.
The target group for the talent scouting program is boys and girls aged 9 to 13 years. The program targets promising talent outside the RCGC membership. When it was first introduced in 2011, RCGC mandated that a structured, long term program was put in place to identify, train and create the future golf champions of Sri Lanka. Provisions were put in place for 20 students to receive free of charge access to training, equipment, practice facilities and access to the golf course via this program.
The timeline agreed upon was 10 years of training to create a national golf champion. Within five years, one of these students, Tania Minel Balasuriya, succeeded in becoming Sri Lanka National Ladies Golf Champion at just 15 years of age.
There is no question that this country harbors much talent, but we need to be proactive in seeking out and nurturing it, says Jehan De Saram, P.G.A. Head Golf Professional at the Royal Colombo Golf Club. As golfers, it is our responsibility to strengthen and develop the game in Sri Lanka, and endeavor to be a feature on the international stage.
De Saram also noted that for a country with so few golfers and limited access to opportunities in this arena, Sri Lanka has made a significant mark on golf in South Asia.
Its noteworthy that many of our award-winning golfers dont fit the mould of the typical Colombo elitist that many golf enthusiasts may be perceived as, he said. This is why we started the junior clinic outreach program in the first place- to dispel this notion and create an opportunity for anyone to learn and benefit from the game. Through the generous support of the Royal Colombo Golf Club and its members, this initiative has helped to nurture the talents of many young golfers.
A Day of Discovery is powered by the generous support of MTV/MBC Channel Organisation. To register to participate in the RCGC Day of Discovery, please send a WhatsApp message to 0775445153 by December 5. Early registrations are recommended in order to avoid disappointment.

Paddy, maize, banana, mangoes, papaw, green gram, crown nut, kurakkan, cowpea and other supplementary crops will be grown.
Many farmers now grow many of these crops in the Eastern Province and they earn a good income now.
The Agriculture Department supplies the seeds to the farmers at low rates with proper instructions and guidance. They received a bumper maize harvest these days. They sell them along either side of the main road in Ampara.
The farmers, however, claimed that wild elephants destroy their crops and requested authorities to take steps to prevent them from invading their cultivation.

Ending Violence Against Women and Girls
Tomorrow, the world marks the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. Women's rights activists have observed November 25 as a day against gender-based violence since 1981. This date was selected to honour the Mirabal sisters, three political activists from the Dominican Republic who were brutally murdered in 1960 by order of the countrys ruler, Rafael Trujillo (1930-1961).
Violence against women and girls (VAWG) is one of the most widespread, persistent and devastating human rights violations in our world today remains largely unreported due to the impunity, silence, stigma and shame surrounding it. Despite the adoption of the Convention of the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) by the UN General Assembly in 1979, violence against women and girls remains a pervasive problem worldwide.
VAW is a global phenomenon that cuts across boundaries of age, socioeconomic status, education and geography. Yet, globally we still do not know very much about its extent. Only 107 of 195 countries have data available on intimate partner violence for example, a number that falls to just 56 countries when we seek to understand non-intimate partner violence.
Even when data is available, it is likely that the figures are an underestimate as it is notoriously difficult to collect sensitive information on VAW as survivors may fear coming forward or feel ashamed. VAW also has an impact on the lives of many women beyond the survivors. The fear of violence can prevent women from pursuing education, working or exercising their political rights and voice. A recent Gallup survey shows that in every region of the world, women consistently feel more insecure than men, although the levels of insecurity significantly vary across regions.
VAW is not only a cause of gender inequality, it is a consequence of it. In many places, gender-based violence is reinforced by discriminatory laws and exclusionary social norms that undermine women and girls' opportunities for education, income and independence. Sometimes VAW accompanies shifting power relations within households and communities, especially when there is resentment against women who move away from conventional roles.
Another bold step in the right direction was embodied by an initiative launched in 2008 and known as the UNiTE to End Violence against Women.
It aims to raise public awareness around the issue as well as increase both policymaking and resources dedicated to ending violence against women and girls worldwide.
Yet, there is still a long way to go on the global scale. To date, only two out of three countries have outlawed domestic violence, while 37 countries worldwide still exempt rape perpetrators from prosecution if they are married to or eventually marry the victim and 49 countries currently have no laws protecting women from domestic violence.
In 2017, the European Union (EU) and the UN launched the Spotlight Initiative, which aims to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls by raising the awareness of this issue, in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
In general terms, it manifests itself in physical, sexual and psychological forms, encompassing:
* intimate partner violence (battering, psychological abuse, marital rape, femicide);
* sexual violence and harassment (rape, forced sexual acts, unwanted sexual advances, child sexual abuse, forced marriage, street harassment, stalking, cyber- harassment);
* human trafficking (slavery, sexual exploitation);
* Female Genital Mutilation (FGM);
* child marriage.
To further clarify, the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women issued by the UN General Assembly in 1993, defines violence against women as any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.
The adverse psychological, sexual and reproductive health consequences of VAWG affect women at all stages of their life. For example, early-set educational disadvantages not only represent the primary obstacle to universal schooling and the right to education for girls; down the line they are also to blame for restricting access to higher education and even translate into limited opportunities for women in the labour market.
While gender-based violence can happen to anyone, anywhere, some women and girls are particularly vulnerable - for instance, young girls and older women, women who identify as lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex, migrants and refugees, indigenous women and ethnic minorities, or women and girls living with HIV and disabilities, and those living through humanitarian crises.
Violence against women continues to be an obstacle to achieving equality, development, peace as well as to the fulfillment of women and girls human rights. All in all, the promise of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - to leave no one behind - cannot be fulfilled without putting an end to violence against women and girls.
The 25th of every month has been designated as Orange Day by the UN Women campaign Say No, UNiTE launched in 2009 to mobilize civil society, activists, governments and the UN system in order to amplify the impact of the UN Secretary-Generals campaign, UNiTE to end Violence Against Women. Participants the world over are encouraged to wear a touch of orange in solidarity with the cause - the colour symbolizes a brighter future and a world free from violence against women and girls.
It is clearly vital to support women and girls who encounter violence, for example, by ensuring they have access to justice, shelter and protection, whether violence is domestic or in the work place. But to break the VAW cycle, policy interventions should focus on the longer-term by changing discriminatory social norms; closing gender gaps whether they are educational, economic or social level; or building awareness about VAW. Progress has been made on many important fronts, such as closing gaps between men and women in primary education and political participation; but there has been inertia and stagnation in others, as employment.
A much greater effort is needed to tackle the patterns of violence that cut deep into many societies so that they are not perpetuated across generations.
****
* 1 in 3 women and girls experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, most frequently by an intimate partner.
* Only 52% of women married or in a union freely make their own decisions about sexual relations, contraceptive use and health care.
* Worldwide, almost 750 million women and girls alive today were married before their 18th birthday; while 200 million women and girls have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM).
* 1 in 2 women killed worldwide were killed by their partners or family in 2012; while only 1 out of 20 men were killed under similar circumstances.
* 71% of all human trafficking victims worldwide are women and girls, and 3 out of 4 of these women and girls are sexually exploited.
* Violence against women is as serious a cause of death and incapacity among women of reproductive age as cancer, and a greater cause of ill health than traffic accidents and malaria combined.

Five modern bowlers with the most lethal yorkers
Death bowling is an art that is hard to master. The bowler needs to predict what the batsman wants to do, and adapt his strategy accordingly.
With batting undergoing a metamorphosis over the last decade or so, it is getting harder and harder for the quicks. The pitches have become flat and two new balls have been introduced, cutting down the possibility of reverse swing.
To add to the bowlers misery, the bats have gone bigger and the rules have been decked in the batsmens favor. Therefore, to be successful, a bowler needs to have the right temperament as well as effective skills.
Death bowling has gone through a lot of changes in recent times, with bowlers trying many different variations. Slower bouncers, back-of-the-hand slower ones and knuckle balls have been added to every bowlers repertoire.
Amidst all the changes though, the yorker has not lost any of its importance. A good toe-crushing yorker is still relevant in the modern day game. It is always seen as a weapon that can destroy lower-order batsman, especially if delivered with good pace.
Lets look at five current bowlers who possess a deadly yorker:
5. TRENT BOULT - NEW ZEALAND
Trent Boult is one of the best fast bowlers New Zealand has ever produced. He has a quick arm action and has the ability to swing the ball both ways.
Boults stock delivery is the in-swinger. He generally bowls around 140 clicks consistently, and New Zealands team management have used him judiciously in the ODIs by giving him an opening spell and preserving him for the death overs.
Boult has a lethal yorker which he uses effectively during the death overs. He usually bowls the in-swinging yorker which tails in late and curves back into the batsman. This is a delivery that is very hard to line up for or get any elevation off.
Going by the stats in the last 24 months, Boult has bowled 276 deliveries in the death overs and picked up 21 wickets at an economy of 8.01.
4. KAGISO RABADA - SOUTH AFRICA
Kagiso Rabadas rise in international cricket has not been a surprise. He showed a lot of promise in the 2014 U-19 World Cup by bowling with pace and hostility, which prompted the South African selectors to draft him into the national side.
Rabada did not disappoint, as he picked up a 6-fer in his debut match against Bangladesh. He is one of the many gems that South Africa has unearthed in its illustrious list of fast bowling talents.
Kagiso Rabada, or KG as he is called by his teammates, consistently bowls close to 150 kph. His natural delivery is the back of the length one which he uses effectively to generate steep bounce at pace.
He has a lethal yorker too, which he bowls at good pace and usually targets the base of the stumps with. Rabada doesnt bowl viciously in-swinging yorkers like Dale Steyn does, but he uses them intelligently and keeps the batsmen guessing.
In the last 24 months, KG has bowled 270 deliveries and picked up 14 wickets at an average of 6.80.
3. MITCHELL STARC - AUSTRALIA
Mitchell Starc has continued the Australian legacy of producing hostile, world-class fast bowlers.
Starc has a height of 6 ft 6 inches, which he uses to his advantage. He has a high-arm action and his wrist position helps him to bowl an accurate in-swinger, which has become his stock delivery. Starc also has a good bouncer and produces good carry due to his height.
Australia have always relied upon Starc to bowl in the death overs, and he has seldom disappointed them. He bowls consistently around 150 kph and keeps hitting the yorker length.
Starc was primarily responsible for carrying Australias bowling attack in the 2015 World Cup, where he picked up 22 wickets. He was particularly effective during the death overs with his toe crushers.
In the last 24 months, Starc has bowled 213 deliveries, picking 15 wickets at an economy of 6.31.
2. JASPRIT BUMRAH - INDIA
Jasprit Bumrah arrived on the scene at a time when Indias fast bowling cupboard had almost become bare. He impressed everyone with his display against Australia in his debut series away from home.
Bumrah has an X-factor about him as he has an unusual action and the ability to move the ball both ways. He has added a well disguised slower one to his repertoire and keeps the batsmen guessing with his pyrotechnics.
Bumrah probably bowls the highest number of yorkers among the current set of fast bowlers.
This has earned him the nickname The Yorker Machine.
He practises this skill by placing a pair of shoes at the popping crease, and he keeps hitting the yorker length day-in day-out.
Bumrah bowls around the 145 kph mark and has been Indias most consistent death bowler in the shorter formats. He once defended 7 runs in a T20 match against England in Nagpur, where he got the better of Joe Root, Jos Buttler and Moeen Ali.
In the lat 24 months, Bumrah has bowled 305 balls, picking up 24 wickets at an economy of 6.12. He has forged a strong death bowling partnership with Bhuvneshwar Kumar.
1. LASITH MALINGA - SRI LANKA
This is a no-brainer. Lasith Malinga has been one of the most successful death bowlers in ODI history who can easily author a book by the name A Death Bowling Manual for Beginners.
He has been one of the pillars of Sri Lankan fast bowling, and has been their leader for the last few years.
Malinga has a side arm action which makes it even more difficult for the batsmen to gauge the angle of the ball. His stock delivery is the in-swinger, but he can move the ball both ways.
Malinga has one of the most lethal yorkers in the game. He has a wide variety of yorkers, which includes a wide yorker, a slower yorker and an in-swinging yorker.
He has 3 hat-tricks in ODIs, and no one can forget his spell against South Africa in the 2007 World Cup where he picked up 4 wickets in 4 deliveries.
He also delivered a masterclass against India, when he bowled to a well-set Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni in the 2014 World T20 Final, giving away just 11 runs from his final 2 overs.
In the last 24 months, Malingas numbers have declined owing to age and injuries.
He still has a decent record though, as he has bowled 197 balls in the death overs, picking 14 wickets at an economy of 7.12. - ck

## Title: Five year tax reduction for agri product income

Five year tax reduction for agri product income
A five year tax exemption on agro industry with an income tax reduction from 28 % to 14%, will be introduced, the Finance and Economic Affairs Ministry said yesterday.
It is also proposed to raise the threshold for the application of ESC Economic Service Charge from Rs. 12.5 million per quarter to Rs.50 million per quarter, to ease hardships to smallholder business operations.
These relief measures taken on the instruction of the President and the Finance and Economic Affairs Minister are aimed at providing highest priority to agricultural development.
The government is of the view that every effort should be made to make use of the 2018 /19 Maha cultivation season as a new beginning.
Agricultural income generated specially by the small scale entrepreneurs in the cultivation of any agricultural produce such as tea, spices, coconut, rubber, paddy, fruits, vegetables etc, to be exempted from income taxation for 5 years.
With the introduction of several changes to the tax system by the previous government, Sri Lanka's business community particularly the small and medium entrepreneurs those engaged in professional and other services and agricultural activities have been confronted with complex taxation and heavy tax burden.
In addition to the imposition of high income taxes on wage income and other remuneration, interest and rent incomes, tax burden has also increased through high tax rates and reduction in tax free thresholds for the implementation of Value Added Tax (VAT), Nation Building Tax (NBT) Economic Services Charge (ESC), withholding taxes, etc. People are looking for a simple, broad based, low tax rates, a transparent tax system and a simplified tax administration. Such a system of taxation is important to provide an environment conducive for doing domestic business in the SME sector, professional and other services and agricultural activities.
While formulating a simple tax system takes some time, the Hon Mahinda Rajapakse, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs, proposes at this stage to introduce some specific measures towards providing incentives that will enable SMEs and small sector business activities to revive rapidly.
Furthermore, the climate has become extremely favourable for full scale cultivation of agricultural crops in both the plantation sector as well as non-plantation agricultural activities such as paddy, grain, fruit and vegetables and as such the government has already taken measures to reduce fertilizer prices, write off interest and penalties of agricultural credits and reduce income tax rates on agricultural income by such entrepreneurs.
The President and the Finance and Economic Affairs Minister are in agreement that highest priority should be given to agricultural development and accordingly the government is of the view that every effort should be made to make use of the 2018/19 Maha cultivation season as a new beginning to raise agricultural production in the country for exports such as tea, spices, and other exportable crops as well as for domestic food consumption and for industrial raw materials. In this context, full scale cultivation using all cultivable land and increase in agricultural productivity to get maximum yields will be incentivized.
Therefore, following measures are proposed for implementation.
a. Agricultural income generated specially by the small scale entrepreneurs in the cultivation of any agricultural produce such as tea, spices, coconut, rubber, paddy, fruits, vegetables, etc, to be exempted from income taxation for a period of 5 years.
b. Income tax rate and profit on processing industries using local agricultural commodities to be reduced from 28 percent to 14 percent.
These two proposals will encourage entrepreneurs in agriculture to engage in cultivation activities and increase the supply to local processing industries and improve market supply for both export and domestic consumption. It also noted that several tea factories are operating below capacity as local production is not adequate, and therefore it is important that tea production be increased as a priority.
c. Previous government has increased the ESC from 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent and reduced threshold level to Rs. 12.5 million. This has imposed serious hardships to small holder business operations. Therefore, it is proposed to raise the thresholdfor the application of ESC from Rs. 12.5 million per quarter to Rs.50 million per quarter.
d. Recognizing the priorities attached by this government to environmental friendly renewable energy sourced power generation, it is proposed that expenditure on the transition to renewable energy sources including the installation of solar panels, tea, rubber, coconut, rice and other agricultural processing factories be recognized as deductible expenses in the computation of taxable profits.
e. In view of the setbacks in economic activities during the past 3 years owing to sharp reduction in private sector credit facilities, high interest rate policies, high taxation at all levels, many entrepreneurs particularly those who engaged in household level businesses and small and medium sized businesses have not been able to service their borrowings from banking and financial institutions on a regular basis. As a result, not only the borrower but also their guarantors have been listed as defaulters in the Credit Information Bureau (CRIB) which has led banks to curtail or suspend credit facilities to such borrowers and guarantors. It is in this background that the Economic Revival Package announced on 1 November 2018 included extending support to the farmers and small paddy millers by way of writing off the interest and penal interest on loans taken in the last 3 years, upto a maximum of Rs.50 million from commercial banks. While accelerated support was provided to the agriculture sector enabling them to seize the good weather conditions, it is acknowledged that other sectors including Tea small holders, SME's in Construction, apparel, manufacturing etc are also faced with a situation in which their growth has been stymied with lack of access to markets, credit etc.
In this context, the Treasury has already been directed to design a package that will support SME entrepreneurs in the short run to be able to access finance and revive their businesses.
As a relief to the consumers, taxes on Watana will be waived or removed by Rs. 10 per kg.
In addition, the government has already reduced fuel prices and taxes and prices of several other commodities to reduce the cost of living particularly for low income families.

Foreign Rifle shooting coach in Sri Lanka on assessment project
The National Shooting Sports Federation of Sri Lanka (NSSF) has brought down Elham Hashemi Masoumi, an A Grade ISSF License coach, to conduct an assessment and training programme for the Sri Lankan Rifle shooters.
The two-day project, conducted at the Scorpion Rifle Shooting Club range in Malabe, was held on Friday and Saturday, and depending on the report provided by Elham, the NSSF will move forward in obtaining the expertise of Elham as a foreign coach.
This is a timely effort made by the NSSF, to bring down an international coach. The two-day programme is a very good move in terms of exploring where local shooters stand in the international arena, through a pair of eyes of an international expert. We have 18 shooters, who have represented Sri Lanka and top performers at national events and five coaches, who will attend the practical and boardroom sessions conducted by Ms. Elham, stated Retired Major General Kenneth Edema, a shooting stalwart in Sri Lanka.
The highly qualified Iranian coach will assess the local shooters for two days and also conduct lectures at the Malabe property, before her final assessment report is presented to Shirantha Peries, the President of NSSF.
Im supposed to see the facilities and the performances of the shooters, to see if I can help or not. Of course some of the equipments are weak and Im writing down the notes on what should be done. Of course, as I see improvement is possible, Elham, a former Iran national shooter, stated.
In the assessment report Ms. Elham will also mention that if she finds it suitable to provide her expertise as an ISSF (International Shooting Sports Federation ) A License coach, which looks positive after the first session on the first day. Elham, a penchant in accepting challenges, has coached her native country Iran for years since 2010 and helped Singapore reach international standards as national coach from 2015 to 2018. Elhams visit and assessment programme is sponsored by the Clay Target Shooting Club of Colombo.

FR challenging summoning of Parliament fixed for support
The Fundamental Rights petition filed seeking a declaration that the Secretary General of Parliament and Attorney General have no authority or power under the Constitution to summon Parliament was yesterday fixed for support on December 4 by the Supreme Court.
This petition had been filed by former Parliamentarian Sarath Weerasekara. The petitioner sought a declaration that the Secretary General of Parliament and the Attorney General have no authority or power under the Constitution to summon Parliament in the absence of any order by the Supreme Court quashing the proclamation of President published in the gazette dated November 9 dissolving Parliament.
Supreme Court two-judge-Bench comprising Chief Justice Nalin Perera and Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya decided to fix the matter for December 4, to be taken up along with ten FR petitions which challenged the dissolution of Parliament.
The petitioner named the Speaker, Secretary General of Parliament and the Attorney General as respondents in the petition.
The petitioner further sought a declaration that Parliament cannot be re-summoned on the strengthen of the Interim Order of the Supreme Court dated November 13, 2018.
In his petition, former MP Weerasekara further sought an declaration that fundamental rights of the petitioner guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been violated by the Secretary General of Parliament and the Attorney General.
The petitioner maintained that as Parliament has been dissolved by proclamation, the Interim Order staying the operation of the same cannot have the effect of the re-convening of Parliament, which continues to stand dissolved until the quashing of the said proclamation.
Therefore, summoning Parliament in disregard of the true meaning of the stay order of the Supreme Court and conducting proceedings therein as undissolved will lead to serious issues relating to Parliament.
Presidents Counsel W.D. Rodrigo with Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana appeared for the petitioner. Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle appeared for the Attorney General.
On November 13, the Supreme Court three-judge-Bench headed by Chief Justice Nalin Perera unanimously issued an interim order staying the operation of the Gazette notification issued by the President to dissolve Parliament.
This Interim Order will be effective until December 7.
The Supreme Court further issued an Interim Order restraining the Election Commission from proceeding to take any steps to conduct the Parliamentary election by virtue of the proclamation until December 7. Accordingly, 10 petitions filed by various political parties and several individuals were fixed for argument on December 4, 5 and 6.

Following a party leaders meeting, the House met at 10.30 a.m. chaired by Speaker Jayasuriya with tight security measures taken in the Parliament complex. The gallery was closed to the public with only the media being granted access.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya received House approval yesterday, to include seven lawmakers to the Selection Committee limiting the names received from the UPFA.
Unable to reach a final verdict at the Party Leaders meeting held in the morning, Speaker Jayasuriya proposed to include lawmakers Lakshman Kiriella, Rauff Hakeem, Rishard Bathiudeen, Mano Ganeshan, Patali Champika Ranawaka from the United National Party (UNP), MP Mawai Senathiraja from the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK), and MP Vijitha Herath from the JVP following the provisions of Standing Order 136 and 143.

Govt. took over a debt ridden economy: Minister
The present government had to take over a debt-ridden economy due to the economic mismanagement of the previous government, said Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera. He was addressing a meeting at Angunakolapelessa, recently.
The minister said the United National Front is preoccupied with blaming the government on baseless grounds and risking the countrys sovereignty.
This clan is trying every trick and treachery to oust the present regime of which Mahinda Rajapaksa is the Prime Minister although it was set up according to the Constitution, the minister said. He said agriculture had been the base of prosperity in the country since ancient times.
As such, benefits would be provided to strengthen the farming community who contribute towards the production process.
He said the past government betrayed the security forces that sacrificed their lives for the freedom enjoyed today.
The minister said as a result of the 30-year-old war, the people knew its brutality.
He added that it was Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa who brought it to an end.

Greg Chappell was brusque, abrasive, highly opinionated and rigid: VVS Laxman
The Greg Chappell saga continues to haunt Indian cricket. After batting icons Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly, former India batsman VVS Laxman slammed the ex-India coach, who had a public spat with Ganguly which led to a bitter fallout from 2005 till the 2007 World Cup.
In his autobiography 281 and Beyond, Laxman described the controversial Australian as, brusque and abrasive, highly opinionated and rigid. The Hyderabadi veteran, who played 134 Tests and scored 8781 runs at an average of 45.97, said that whatever India achieved in Chappells tenure was more because of the players.
I had been a huge fan of Greg Chappell for a very long time. I had admired his presence at the crease in photographs and videos of him  elegant, almost majestic. Tall and upright, he struck the ball beautifully and had wonderful hands, especially when he fielded in the slips. During my two interactions with him long before he took charge as our coach, I had come away with my knowledge enhanced and my respect for him multiplied, Laxman wrote.
Below are excerpts from Laxmans autobiography
When Greg was named as Johns [Wright] successor, I was both happy and excited. I looked forward to feeding off Gregs knowledge and his vast reservoir of expertise. Given where Indian cricket was at when John parted ways with us, it was imperative that we had a strong, respected individual who could lift the morale of the team and dispel the clouds of uncertainty hovering over our heads.
We had made a lot of progress as a unit in 200304, but I for one felt that we had not been allowed to build on that in the season that followed. For various reasons, none of them cricketing, we had been reduced to a house divided. During the summer of 2005, I went to England to play club cricket for Lashings. Among my teammates that year was Greg Blewett, the Australian batsman. Blewett told me that I needed to be careful with Greg.
Greg had been the coach of South Australia when Blewett played for the state, he said, adding that the former Australian captain had created a lot of instability within the team. I didnt take Blewett seriously. I thought he was just letting off steam.
Our first formal introduction to our new coach was at a camp in Bangalore, ahead of a triangular one-day tournament in Sri Lanka. Greg was there with Ian Fraser, his assistant, and it was a camp that was uniquely different. Greg introduced us to various other aspects, one of the more interesting ones being the de Bono method of lateral thinking, with the six hats and the works. From the skills point of view as well, it was a very good camp.
My struggles with the 50-over format continued in Sri Lanka, this time not helped by back spasms, which had become something of a constant companion. I was in a lot of pain and with my movements restricted, I missed the first two games. I played the next two with limited success, and was dropped for the final. When we reached Sri Lanka for the tri-series, Greg had his first one-on-one with me. He wanted me to play my natural game, to play aggressively. He told me that I was a very important member of the side.
The instability in the team environment was in some ways because of a new selection panel, and Sourav himself was under pressure because he was not scoring as many runs as he would have loved to as captain. I felt that with Greg coming in, I would get a fair chance to establish myself. I did, however, quickly realise, like a majority of my teammates, that Greg wasnt quite the messiah Indian cricket was looking for. We did produce the results, undoubtedly.
Our 50-over team won a record 16 consecutive ODIs while chasing, we scored our first Test win in South Africa, we won a series in the Caribbean for the first time in 35 years. Apart from the unforgettable heartbreak of the first-round elimination from the 2007 World Cup  and it hurts me even today, though I wasnt a part of the squad  we strung together a fairly good run in both Tests and ODIs, but I must stress that the results were less due to the coach and more due to the players.
Its not as if my teammates and I are determined to paint Greg as an evil monster. As I have already said, I was among those most delighted at being presented with an opportunity to work alongside and under him, but it didnt take long for our respect to dissipate because of Gregs attitude and approach. He was brusque and abrasive, highly opinionated and rigid in his thinking. His man-management skills were non-existent. He quickly sowed further seeds of discontent in an already diffident team.
If we had misgivings when it came to Gregand we did have plenty, yesit wasnt because of our egos. We never felt we were bigger than the game. I can certainly speak for myself, and I will say this much  Greg sent out conflicting signals, treating me with a callousness that I found shockingly unacceptable. I will always respect Greg Chappell the batsman. Unfortunately, I cant say the same for Greg Chappell the coach. - Cricketcountry

Hamilton says F1 will miss departing Alonso
Abu Dhabi, Thursday: Lewis Hamilton heaped praise on one of his most bitter erstwhile rivals on Thursday before declaring that he and Formula One will miss the retiring Fernando Alonso.
Looking back after arguably his greatest season in a decade at the top of the sport, Hamilton said he had matured significantly since he and Alonso were antagonistic team-mates at McLaren in 2007 when a spectacular bust-up cast a shadow over their relationship.
Weve had good times and bad times, said Hamilton, speaking to reporters ahead of this weekends season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
Weve grown. He was obviously here before I was and achieved incredible things before I got here and also partly while I was here. Its been a privilege to be in an era where he was racing...
Will I miss him Yeah. I think the sport will miss him...
Alonso will be aiming next year to become only the second man to claim motorsports Triple Crown by adding a triumph at the Indianapolis 500, with McLaren, to his victories at the Monaco Grand Prix and 24 Hours of Le Mans.
A decade on from his first of five F1 title wins, Hamilton also insisted that he never felt a personal sense of animosity towards Alonso.
I dont feel like I ever had a personal issue with Fernando, said Hamilton. I think it was more how the team was run, or the situation we were put in, and how that was managed.
I dont think we ever necessarily had an issue between us, except we were trying to beat each other and murder each others laps on the track.
Outside, we used to play NBA 2K, or whatever it was, together every now and then. It was always really quite harmonious outside...
I definitely think, naturally, were older -- old men now and the respect between us, Id like to think, is higher than its ever been and I dont think thats ever going to change. AFP

Havies edge out Navy-22-18
Havelock sports club rugby team was really lucky to edge out a spirited Navy sports club by 22 points ( 3 tries, 2 conversions, 1 penalty) to 18 ( 2 tries, 1 conversion, 2 penalties ) in their Dialog A Division inter-club league rugby first round match played at Havelock Park under lights yesterday.
At half time Havies led 12 points to 6.
Both teams dished out a spectacular display of running rugby in the whole game but Navy was the pick of the lot where they had an outstanding game in both in attack and defence but really unfortunate to lose in the end.The Sailors staged a spirited performance in the second half but could not win due to some handling errors which occured due to wet conditions, hence they ended up on the losing side.
The victorious Havelock Sports Club scored their tries through winger Sashan Mohamed (two) and centre Iranga Ariyapala (one) while full back Rizah Mubarak put over the two conversions and the solitary penalty for the winners.
For the losing Navy Sports club prop forward Charith Silva (one) and full back cum captain Thilina Weerasinghe (one) scored the two tries while Weerasinghe put over the two penalties and the only conversion.
The final score stood at Havelock Sports Club 22 points to Navy Sports Club 18.
Referee - Priyantha Gunaratne had an off day with the whistle.

Healy, Perry carry Australia to fifth WT20 final
Australia knocked the hosts and defending champions out of the ICC Women's World T20 2018, winning the first semi-final by 71 runs with a comprehensive all-round performance.
Asked to bat on Thursday, 22 November, Australia quickly realised the pitch at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium was one on which they'd have to grind it out, and adapted accordingly. Meg Lanning and the in-form Alyssa Healy combined for 51 runs, Lanning surviving a stumping chance and some sharp fielding by the Windies.
Deandra Dottin, backed by sheer pace, bowling Lanning just when she was set, promised to swing the momentum the hosts way, but a 17-run over in the 19th and a handy cameo from Rachael Haynes took the Australians to a strong 142/5. A 10-run over to get the Windies innings started bode well, but then it was the three-time world champions ahead all the way. Quick work behind the stumps from Healy ran out Hayley Matthews, and a beauty from Ellyse Perry took out Dottin.
Stafanie Taylor got into double-digits, but a succession of soft dismissals quickly ended the Windies challenge and silenced a full stadium.
This will be the fifth World T20 final in a row that Australia will play.
Scores: Australia Women 142-5 in 20 overs (Alyssa Healey 46, Meg Lanning 31, Rachael Haynes 25 n.o,)
West Indies Women 71 in 17.3 overs (Stafanie Taylor 16, Ellyse Perry 2/2, Delissa Kimmince 2.17, Ashley Gardner 2/15)

Veddah Chief Uruwarige Wannila Aththo said the country needs to go for an election now to untangle the current political impasse.
Wannila Aththo stated this when a group of academics met him to discuss the prevailing situation in the country yesterday.
At this juncture, where the entire country is in a crisis, it would be better to give the people an opportunity take a decision for the country than giving it to the 225 public representatives in Parliament, he said.
He said public representatives who had been elected to Parliament by the public are crossing sides continuously.Therefore, taking decisions as per their desire would further aggravate the crisis, he said.
Wannila Aththo said the conduct of MPs had damaged the image of the country before the international community.

Inaugural over 50s World Cup on a grand scale
Cricket fans are in for a treat between Nov 20 and Dec 5 with Australia playing host to the inaugural over 50s World Cup tournament featuring teams from England, South Africa, New Zealand, Wales, and Canada and notably for local fans a team from Sri Lanka as well.
Under the auspice of Cricket Australia and with endorsements from Australian and NSW Over 50s Cricket Association and Veterans Cricket Australia, all matches will be played across noteworthy venues in Sydney.
The organising committee officially opened the games at a gala afternoon gathering on November 20 at a picturesque harbour view location overlooking the iconic Sydney harbour. All teams were welcomed and briefed on tournament protocols and procedures. It was an extremely colourful occasion with participants dressed in their unique national outfits.
The Sri Lankan team received much praise for their stand-out uniforms and if this is any indication of things to come we hope to further prove how good we are on the field as well quipped Richie De Silva (Chairmanonvener) instrumental in putting together the Sri Lankan contingent for these games.
Despite the festival feel of these games, all teams will be coveting and wanting their country name etched on the trophy as the first ever team to win this championship. Host nation Australia is ready for the challenge and have undergone a gruelling selection process where players were picked on merit at the completion of the recent over 50s national championship. Notwithstanding a small pool of players to choose from, the Sri Lankans are ready to rumble with predominantly cricketers of local repute and former glory.
It is envisaged this tournament will encourage more countries to join in the years ahead said Mr. Striling Hamman of Veterans Cricket Australia. Best Wishes to all players and may The Lion Roar and bring pride to both country and cricket.

Dialog A Division Rugby League
Injunction issued on SLR to suspend foreign player participation
After a successful appeal by CH & FC regarding foreign player participation only to the bottom four clubs (CR & FC, Army SC, Police SC and Air Force SC) of the Dialog Rugby League, an injunction order has been issued on Sri Lanka Rugby to suspend the foreign player representation for the ongoing Sri Lanka rugby season with immediate effect.
The injunction order came in the morning ordering the bottom four clubs to withdraw their overseas players from the current ongoing league rugby tournament from today onwards.
Earlier, the Sri Lanka rugby despite several protests by the CH and FC, Navy sports club, Havelock sports club and Kandy sports club, still went ahead foolishly and granted bottom four teams one overseas player each in their respective 23 member team squad.
According to the verdict given by the high Court , hereon no player of foreign origin will be allowed to play in the ongoing Dialog Rugby League and all SLR conducted tournaments for 2018/19. This will be including the Clifford Cup knock out as well.
Speaking exclusively to the Daily News, a top official of the CH & FC rugby committee said we first informed Sri Lanka rugby several times amicably not to proceed with this foreign player rule as this is a clear injustice to top four teams since it lacks Equal playing field, but SLR did not listen to us at all, so we had no option but to proceed with this court case due to the injustice in the foreigners rule; not only to benefit us; but on behalf of all the top four teams affected by this rule. Also it gave the bottom four clubs an unfair advantage. But very sad to say that only Kandy sports club gave us support and others did not help us in any way possible.
This means with immediate effect from today that CR & FC, Police SC, Army SC and Air Force SC will have to withdraw the services of their overseas players from their 23 member playing squad.
Both Army and Air Force has two contracted Fijian players in their squads while CR & FC has one Samoan and Police a Fijian in their side. Those players are , Joseph Fuimaona for CR & FC , Emosi Vunivosa for Police, Raduva Kausoo of Air Force, and Sovesta Ualuvu & Rura Boila for Army.

Italy braced for wrath of beaten All Blacks
Rome, Friday: Italy coach Conor OShea concedes his side are braced for a David against Goliath challenge against world champions New Zealand in their final November Test on Saturday at the Stadio Olimpico.
The All Blacks arrive in Rome having lost 16-9 to Ireland in Dublin last weekend, a further wake-up call for the worlds top team after a defeat by the Springboks back in September.
But even if New Zealands aura of invincibility has started to wane less than a year out from the World Cup, OShea is expecting another rough ride from a side the Italians have never beaten in 14 previous meetings.
The last clash between the two teams was in 2016 in Rome, with the All Blacks winning 68-10.
It will be important not to think too much about their potential, above all a team of this level, said Irishman OShea.
They are like Brazil in football, its a game that everyone wants to play. We want to end the November Tests with a good performance, playing our best rugby.
OShea made just one enforced change to the side that lost 26-7 to Australia in Padua last weekend. Earlier in the month they beat Georgia 28-17 but lost 54-7 to Six Nations champions Ireland in Chicago.
Benetton Treviso wing Luca Sperandio comes in for Mattia Bellini who scored Italys only try against the Wallabies before going off with a shoulder injury.
But the Italians have two New Zealand-born players -- Jayden Hayward and Dean Budd -- in their ranks.
Fullback Hayward, 31, was New Zealands promising player of the year in his debut season with Taranaki in 2008, but has been playing in Italy for Treviso since 2014, making his Test debut last year.
Lock Budd, 32,joined Treviso in 2012 and has played 14 Tests since qualifying for Italy in 2017.
New Zealand coach Steve Hansen has rung the changes after last weeks loss to Ireland.
Hansen retained fly-half Beauden Barrett and fullback Damian McKenzie in a starting line-up featuring 11 changes from the side that ran out in Dublin, resisting calls to start the in-form Richie Mounga.
Instead Mounga stays on the bench as Hansen sticks with his strategy of using Barrett and McKenzie as dual playmakers.
The combination has failed to fire so far, with the world champions scraping to a 16-15 win over England before losing 16-9 to Ireland last week.
Weve got an excited group of players who are keen to make the most of their opportunity and represent the jersey, themselves and their country with a strong performance on Saturday, said Hansen.
The group is aware that this is our last week together and theyre determined to really prepare well, play well and enjoy every moment of the week.
The Italians will bring plenty of line speed, with a wide defensive spread, and again allows us to experience playing this type of team. Theyre big men who play with a lot of passion and pride.
We saw in their match against Australia last week just how difficult they can be to play if you allow them to dictate the terms of the game.
We look forward to again playing at Stadio Olimpico in front of the Italian people and delivering a performance we can all be proud of. AFP

Ja-Ela Urban Council Chairman Shammika Dias (SLPP) moved a motion endorsing the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister at the monthly meeting of the UC November 9.
Councillor Anne Deepika Marcus (SLPP) supporting the motion said previous government did not develop the country. She said Mahinda Rajapaksa was appointed as the Prime Minister by the President to revive the stalled development.
Councillor Sumedha Rukmal (SLPP) said Mahinda Rajapaksa is full of experience and he is the most suitable person to develop the country.
Councillor Anton Nishantha (JVP) said the new appointment has created political chaos in the country.
Chairman Dias cut him short and said the JVP is known for murders and chaos.
You are a dictator. You cannot order me to shut-up. I am speaking on the motion, Nishantha said.
Earnest Fernando (UNP) said the appointment is shameful and they buy parliamentarians for money.
Susantha Perera (UNP) said President Sirisena has done unconstitutional things. The President is ungrateful. He betrayed the country and gave it to a set of people who behave like wild animals, he said.

Counsillor Susantha Perera (UNP) opposed the motion. I do not accept any other payment other than my salary.
We were voted to serve the people, not to live with the peoples money to fatten our bellies, he said.

Joe Root's England will move to No. 2 in Tests after Sri Lanka series
The England cricket team will move to second place in the ICC Test Championship at the conclusion of the Test series in Sri Lanka, which they lead 2-0 after wins in Galle and Pallekele this month.
Joe Root last week became the first England captain to win a Test series in Sri Lanka since 2001 when his team won by 57 runs at Pallekele after winning the Galle Test by 211 runs. An unassailable 2-0 series lead means that England will shove South Africa down to third in the ICC rankings for Test teams irrespective of what happens in the final match at the SSC.
If England beat Sri Lanka in Colombo, they will move to 108 ratings points, eight fewer than current No 1 India. A draw will put them on 107 points and a loss would tie them with South Africa on 106 points, but ahead by a fraction of a point.
The ICC will update its rankings after the SSC Test.
Root said after the Pallekele win that England want to keep gaining and reclaim No 1.

Jones wants sharp and smart England against Australia
London, Friday: England coach Eddie Jones has warned his side to stay sharp and smart when they bring down the curtain on their 2018 against his native Australia at Twickenham on Saturday.
Joness men have won just five of 11 Tests in 2018 and Australia four of 12 heading into this weekends match -- concerning figures with less than a year to go until the World Cup in Japan.
It was all a far cry from Joness stunning start as England boss -- an appointment made after Australia knocked the hosts out of the 2015 World Cup -- which saw just two defeats in his first 26 Tests in charge of the Red Rose.
But victory on Saturday would be a sixth in a row for England against Australia under Jones.
More importantly, it would also mean they had won three of their four Twickenham encounters this month, with the only reverse an encouraging if agonising 16-15 defeat by world champions New Zealand.
England, however, were sluggish at the start of last weeks eventual 35-15 win over Japan and found themselves five points down at half-time.
But Jones has reverted to something near his strongest available side with Owen Farrell, whose entry off the bench for the second half turned the tide against Japan, starting at fly-half.
Intriguingly, Farrells co-captain Dylan Hartley is on the bench, with Jamie George preferred as the starting hooker.
No one knows better than Jones, who exactly 15 years earlier to the day on Thursday had been Australias coach when they lost the 2003 World Cup final to England, how Wallaby rugby must live on its wits given a relatively small playing base.
And he warned England would have to pay close attention to Australia centres Bernard Foley and Samu Kerevi, who between them combine guile and power.
Foley obviously will be the distributor and Kerevi can knock over a few pins, so were going to have to be good defensively, said Jones.
But to get the opportunity to use the ball were going to have to be sharp and smart.
Traditionally, England-Australia clashes have been framed as a contest between Red Rose forwards and Wallaby backs, although the hosts will look to bring Manu Tuilagi off the bench in what is set to be the injury-plagued centres first Test in more than two years.
Certainly, Englands pack will be hoping to starve an Australia side coached by Michael Cheika -- who played alongside Jones for Sydney club Randwick -- of the ball.
A key figure in that aim will be Saracens second-row Maro Itoje.
I think every game he looks like hes going to become the best lock in the world, and its another opportunity for him to knock on the door, said Jones.
Hurting Pocock plays (Sub head)
Australias influential No 8, David Pocock, has been included in the run-on XV despite a neck injury suffered during last weeks 26-7 win against Italy.
I wouldnt say he is fully fit, he is hurting, said Cheika, who guided Australia to the 2015 World Cup final.
But he added: I wouldnt take a risk physically with him.
Australia scrum-half Will Genia will win his 100th cap but there was no place at all in the matchday 23 for talented playmaker Kurtley Beale.
I want to play a certain way in this game and, with that thought in mind I had to make some really difficult decisions, Cheika explained.
Saturdays match will see the Wallabies wearing their Indigenous jersey, first introduced last year, which acknowledges the contribution of Australias Aboriginal community.
They are the original people of Australia. It is giving back to them and appreciating everything they have done for our country, explained prop Sekope Kepu.
Wearing it at Twickenham this weekend, there is a bit of emotion around it.
We are from a special country and to be here in England, the Mother Country, is quite unique. AFP

JVP MPs call for establishing democracy in and out of Parliament
A group of JVP MPs pointed out that their struggle is for establishing democracy in and out of Parliament and demanded President Maithripala Sirisena to take the necessary action to restore the balance in the country, considering the majority shown by 122 MPs of the UNP, JVP and the TNA in Parliament, for the third time yesterday.
The JVP MPs holding a press briefing in Parliament yesterday emphasised that they shall not vote in favour of Ranil Wickremesinghe at any given circumstance. We have never voted in favour of him and we will continue to follow the same stance in the future, the JVP MPs observed.
It is the Presidents responsibility to appoint a new Prime Minister and a Cabinet now that the UPFA has failed once again to show a majority in House.
The JVP is an independent party that will neither enslave itself to the UNP nor to the UPFA.
We also would like to deny the allegation made by Dinesh Gunawardena who says that the Speaker has violated the Constitution and the Standing Orders when conducting the proceedings of the House. The JVP made sure that everything happens in line with the Constitution and the Standing Orders, JVP MP Vijitha Herath pointed out.
Commenting on the recent statement by S.B.Dissanayake requesting President Sirisena to withdraw the Gazette dissolving Parliament, Herath said that S.B.Dissanayake has now panicked that they will lose if they go for a general election.
There are, I think, only seven MPs left in the SLFP. This is why Dissanayake is asking for a Provincial Council election. They are the people who supported the President in these reckless decisions. Now they are trying to protect him from the repercussions, Herath also said.
Meanwhile, JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti said that whoever shows a 113 votes in Parliament now shall not represent the mandate of the people. Thus, it is important that a free and fair general election be held, Handunnetti pointed out.
JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa urged the people and religious leaders to stand against the purported government. He also observed that any decision taken by the purported government would stand invalid and legal action must be taken against such a decision in due course.

Klopp faces quandary as Spurs plot Chelsea downfall
London, Friday: Jurgen Klopp must juggle Liverpools Premier League ambitions with a pivotal Champions League trip to Paris Saint-German while Tottenham hope to prove their mettle with victory against Chelsea in the game of the weekend.
For the first time in English top-flight history, there are three unbeaten teams after 12 matches, with Liverpool tucked in two points behind leaders Manchester City and Chelsea a further two points adrift.
Liverpool travel to seventh-placed Watford on Saturday, seeking to stay in touch with City while Pep Guardiola prepares to face his predecessor Manuel Pellegrini, who is now in charge at West Ham.
Manchester United host Crystal Palace after their dispiriting defeat against City while Arsenal have a tricky tie at Bournemouth.
AFP Sport picks out some of the key talking points ahead of this weekends matches.
Klopps balancing act
Last seasons Champions League finalists Liverpool will travel to Paris next week for their penultimate group game with their hopes of reaching the knockout stages in the balance.
But first they must negotiate a potential banana skin at Watford, knowing that slipping further behind against City could prove fatal, even at this early stage of the season.
Klopp gave an upbeat assessment of the season so far despite a couple of disappointing Champions League defeats.
So many things are better than last year, he said. Defending is better, set-pieces are better, we are much more mature in games, game management is better. So many things are better.
Its all good, I like the season, he added. There has been a lot of improvement so far and there is still space for further improvement. But a very intense period is coming up now.
Can Spurs earn statement win
Tottenham have won nine of their Premier League games so far but, significantly, two of their three defeats have come against top-four rivals Manchester City and Liverpool.
Now they have the chance to leapfrog Chelsea with a victory at Wembley, with Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino suggesting the lack of Champions League football is helping his London rivals.
This season they are competing in the Europa League again and its completely different for Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool or us because were competing in the Champions League, he said. Its a completely different competition.
I am not surprised (by their start) because Chelsea have an unbelievable squad and players. This summer they invested. They signed players, quality players and they added to the squad. But its normal, they have one point more than us.
Arsenal travel to Bournemouth on Sunday, hoping to break a run of three consecutive draws in all competitions. Manager Unai Emery has claimed the club needed a breath of fresh air after 22 years of Arsene Wenger. So far his formula appears to be working, with the club just three points off the Champions League places, but he is in no doubt about how tough the task will be, despite the bright start to the season.

ICC Women's World T20 2018
Knights spinners shine as England joins Australia in final
Heather Knight, the England captain, took 3/9, and left-arm spinners Sophie Ecclestone and Kirstie Gordon took two wickets each as they set up an eight-wicket win to seal a spot in the final of the ICC Women's World T20 2018.
Choosing to bat at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua without Mithali Raj in the XI, India made a statement.
With Smriti Mandhana and Taniya Bhatia adding 43 for the first wicket inside the Powerplay on what looked like slow wicket, the gamble seemed to work. However, they then lost their last eight wickets for 23 runs.
The England spinners did much of the damage, with Gordon getting Harmanpreet Kaur to miscue one and captain Knight scalping two in two to bowl out the opposition for 112 in 19.3 overs.
India, going with an all-spin attack, sent back the openers for single-digit scores to give themselves an opening. But Amy Jones and Nat Sciver worked the gaps and ran hard.
Their 50 partnership came off 39 balls without anything too flashy.
Kaur stuck to the tactics that had worked well for the team so far, but the one-side fields only made for easy singles. A four off the first ball of the 18th over brought up a well-earned half-century for Jones and a comfortable win.
England thus joined Australia in the final of the tournament at the same venue on Saturday, 24 November.
Scores:
India Women 112 in 19.3 overs (Smitri Madhana 34, Jemimah Rodriguez 26, Sophie Ecclestone 2/22, Kirstie Gordon 2/20, Heather Knight 3/9)
England Women 116-2 in 17.1 overs (Amy Jones 53 n.o., Natalie Sciver 52 n.o.)
