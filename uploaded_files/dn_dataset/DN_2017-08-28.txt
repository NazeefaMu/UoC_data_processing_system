Depoliticise public service
Abolition of politically driven trade unions and fencing political appointments in the government sector are prerequisites for an independent public service, Government and Provincial Government Trade Union Federation (GPGTUF) points out.
In a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena, GPGTUF General Secretary Ajith K. Tilakaratne said public servants should be freed from political influences and be given opportunity to act independently.
The GPGTUF proposes that it is time to establish a solid framework to make public service an independent entity. The political influence over government service deters 1.5 million public servants from executing their responsibilities independently, the GPGTUF observes.
It also holds political appointments and politically driven trade unions responsible for the general publics lack of respect towards government service.
The GPGTUF proposes to limit recruitments to the government service via competitive exams only, in order to prevent political appointments. It also highlights the importance of eliminating politically driven trade unions.
Numerous conflicts within a government institution between trade unions holding different political views have a negative impact on the service provided to the public by that institution, the GPGTUF appoints out.
All politically motivated trade unions should be eliminated.
It is incorrect to allow politically driven trade unions to distort the government service.
It would consequently endanger the public trust towards the government, the letter reads.

We will defeat 20th Amendment at SPC on Tuesday
The resolution on 20th Amendment to the Constitution to be presented at the Southern Provincial Council special meeting on Tuesday would be defeated, Galle District Joint Opposition Councilor Chamly Withanachchi said.
"Guided by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, we will defeat the Act as it goes against the Constitution. The Joint Opposition enjoys the majority in the council. We met the former President and discussed over the issue in Colombo. We demand the authorities to hold the Provincial Council election soon. The act curtails some powers of Chief Ministers," he said.
SP Chief Government Whip Ajith Rajapaksa said the proposed act was to be submitted at the previous council meeting held on August 22, but it was not.
"When we inquired about it from the secretary, he said they had not received the 20th Amendment Bill at that time. Therefore, a written request was made from the Chairman with signatures of 27 councillors to convene a special meeting on August 29.
Opposition Leader of the Council Tennakoon Nilame assured that they would support the Amendment. "We support the move. It will minimize numerous election related frauds and malpractices. We plan to discuss the issue at our party members meeting before we take part in the debate," he said. Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva said they had not officially received a copy of the draft bill and would take a decision according to the instructions of the party leadership.

All smiles 
The term forever young could have been invented for her. At forty plus years Dilhani Ashokamala Ekanayake can safely step into the shoes of a character much younger than her age. According to her husband, Priyankara Perera, the secret to her youthful beauty is in her carefree nature. She has always been one such person who just loves to be herself and her signature laugh is a great example of how one should let go of stress and simply love what life has to offer. Dividing her time between her shooting schedules and home making, Dilhani has given life to some pivotal roles in recent times. Two of her films Dharmayuddhaya and Heena Hoyana Samanallu are currently screening in cinemas islandwide.
The professional
I havent acted for nearly 20 years. Therefore I do not know how shooting proceeds now. However Dilhani has always been very friendly with everyone on the sets. She has been a loveable figure among all the artistes those days. They considered her as their little sister because she joined the field when she was very young.
Though she is still acting in many productions now, Dilhani is also very selective. She had to let go of some productions due to issues with the dates. There are also instances in which she has given the green light for a production only to find that another actress had taken over the role later. However, she does not fret over such matters.
The person
Dilhani is not a serious character. However, she is very thoughtful and well aware of what she is doing and what is happening around her. She is easy going. She does not like to take all the issues and stressful factors around her onto her shoulders. She simply loves to live the moment, basking in happiness and freedom. At times even those around her have trouble trying to figure out what is going on in her head. Therefore, it is difficult for people to judge her at a glance.
Lifestyle
Dilhani acted in fewer productions after marriage. She gave acting a break for about one and a half years after our son was born. She had a lot of help from her mother and a couple of maids then. I never pressurised her to handle the household chores. Since I too have been into acting, I knew the nature of the field. There is an understanding between us. Now that our son is 22 years old she can dedicate herself once again to acting. However she manages to balance all her duties well.
She cooks and cleans the house when she is at home. She takes care of me too. We get less time to spend together because of our lifestyles. She goes for shooting during the day and I go to sing at musical shows during the night. At times we do not encounter each other for a day or two even though we both live in the same house.
The meeting
We have met each other during film related events and I remember speaking to Dilhani at such an event once. However we got to know each other well while we were both acting in Upali Priyanthas Wada Barinam Wadak Na in 1988. I acted a guest role in the film while she did the main role opposite Lal Weerasinghe. She acted the role of a girl who was facing a lot of problems and needed to be rescued. Though this was one of her earliest films, I did not see any amateurish qualities in her. She acted her scenes like a pro.
Later I acted in around five films with her. However only one - K W Pereras Madhuri - was released. That portrays a love story. Two of our films, Madhumali and Ginigath Rathriya were destroyed. Eka Mawakage Daruwo too was not released due to various reasons.
Our relationship was formed while shooting for Madhumali. I only had brotherly feelings towards her then. However fellow actors like Cletus Mendis, Teddy Vidyalankara and Tennyson Cooray played the matchmakers roles and got us into a relationship. We married on December 24, 1993, three months after we became a couple. We held a small function at Dilhanis home for the registration without having a grand show because there were too many people to invite. However the news was leaked and some artistes like Sanath and Sabeetha gatecrashed the event. Our son, Pasindu, was born on August 31, 1995. He is studying Aerocraft Engineering in USA now.
Work related matters
We discuss our work together. I have requested Dilhani not to act in certain productions at times and she has respected my word. Sulanga and Sudu Kalu Saha Alu which I almost forced her to take part in have won awards. There are a few times I have advised her to take part in certain productions without considering the money too much because I have felt that they are good work. At times people who are known to me try to rope her into their work. I block such opportunities because I know what kind of people are involved in them. She has worked on a few such productions but had come back to me saying that I was right in the first place because they have jilted her or had not kept their word on some matters. However she does not take such incidents to heart.
His favourite films in which she has acted in
I like Dilhanis acting in Chaya Maya and Eka Da Vehi. Me Mage Sandai in which she acted the role of a Tamil girl won awards at the Singapore International Film Festival 2001 and the Tokyo International Film Festival in 2001 but I havent watched it yet. Sulanga also won a presidential award. Aakasa Kusum is one of my favourites. The last one I watched was Heena Hoyana Samanallu and I think she acted well in it too.
I dont get a chance to watch a film mostly due to my lifestyle. If I feel that there is a good film I would watch it. However my tastes are mostly with past films. Dilhani too loves old films and songs. Many of the films made today cannot compete with old hits. I am also more of a music person than a moviegoer.
Her favourite songs that he has sung
I am into classical music. However it is mostly my father, J A Milton Pereras songs that Dilhani likes to listen to. Kandulu Atarata Sina Reli Wemi is one of her favourites. We are both fans of Victor Ratnayake and Milton Malawarachchi.
Rumours
There was once a rumour that Dilhani and I had gotten divorced. Many called inquiring whether she was still living in our house. This was the time that Nilmini Tennakoon and Madhumadhava Aravinda had filed for divorce. Since some of the newspaper headlines read that an actress and a vocalist were separating, many presumed that it was us.
We also do not get a chance to go out together much. Dilhanis film premiers usually fall on Fridays and since that is the day that everyone gets set for the weekend, there is usually a musical concert that night. I also do not like being photographed consistently. I hate having selfies clicked!
Happiest and saddest moments in life
Last year our son sent a picture of the result sheet which showed that he has scored four As in his examination. Dilhani jumped for joy when she saw this. The only time I have seen her crying hard was at her fathers funeral.
Foodwise
Dilhani is not a picky eater. I am more into traditional village food. She can cook in a jiffy by taking only a little more than half an hour. Whatever she makes, though she makes them in a hurry, tastes good. In rare cases, when she sees that something has not gone down well with me she tells me not to utter a word because that she has prepared it in a hurry. Then she makes a beeline for the exit.
She usually eats around 11 am and then has her dinner by 6.30 pm. She snacks on something like a biscuit around 3 pm. She does not watch her diet in particular because at times she puts on a bit but she notices it quickly and works out to lose the extra flab. She always eats small portions.
An alternative profession
If she did not become an actress Dilhani could have been a zoo keeper! She loves animals. We stopped keeping pets because it was very painful for her when the dogs passed away. Now all the street dogs are her friends. She feeds and cares for them. Then she feeds the birds who visit our garden in the afternoons.
A profession which includes caring for animals would have suited her just fine.

Lakshman Jayakody
He was an icon
Politics, which was considered pure, has now transmuted into just another profit-making enterprise with the advent of consumerism.
'Everything for money' is now the moto of so-called socialists, liberals and democrats, but there are some persons of character and integrity who have managed to retain their moral integrity in public life in the face of these forces.
When speaking of Lakshmans in Sri Lankan politics, we meet these exemplary two figures: Lakshman Kadiragamar and Laksman Jayakody.
Taking them as an examples, anyone entering present day Sri Lankan politics can resolve to provide an exemplary political service for a better future.
LJ won the Divulapitiya Electorate in the general elections held in July, 1960 and in 1970, won under the Samagi Perumuna and entered Parliament as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Minister of Defence.
He provided yeoman service to the then Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. As Deputy Minister of Defence, he was a pillar of strength to Sirimava Bandaranaike.
He was successful in providing a human face in defeating the internal conflict that began in 1970.
The role he played in rehabilitating misguided youth without letting them get destroyed speaks well for him as a person who has provided a community service beyond his traditional political role.
His memory as a great humanitarian still lives on in the minds of those who had been involved in the youth revolution of the seventies. He was extremely fluent in English as he had been educated at Trinity College, Kandy.
As Deputy Foreign Minister, his efforts at updating Sri Lankas foreign relations was admirable.
He was able to face the challenges to the United Front Government because of his fluency in English and Sinhala.
He was a humble and silent personality even though he hailed from a aristocratic family from Siyana Korale. Only a handful of pro people politicians are born from such political backgrounds.
Lakshman Jayakody, whose elitist background became a stumbling block in entering peoples politics, was able to overcome this obstacle. However, due to his practicality in managing two frontline ministries, he left an indelible mark in Sri Lankas political landscape.
His organizational skills speak volumes in his handling of the Non-Aligned Conference held in 1976. He was instrumental in popularizing the vision of the worlds first female Prime Minister, Sirimavo Bandaranayake.
His political life is characterized by his admirable example of not using any public property for personal gain or use. His daughter, Erandathi and son, Chandana are witnesses to this fact.
By reading the character of Laksman Jayakody, we can learn immensely on how to live while in and out of power. The services he provided to Siyana Korale and the country as a whole will never fade away from peoples memories and will live on forever.
Dr. Lionel Mendis
A versatile exponent
Dr. Lionel Mendis was a legendary in cricket coaching in our era. Both Lionel and his brother Nelson were pioneers of cricket in Sri Lanka.
This bold statement cannot be denied by any cricket-loving Sri Lankan.
Both brothers disciplined and nurtured school cricketers of their respective schools as masters-in-charge of cricket at Ananda College and Nalanda College, respectively.
As an opening batsman of Richmond College cricket team where my late father too played long before, Dr. Lionel Mendis showed his class along with Dr. Nandisiri Jesanthuliyana; another world figure who served as the Deputy Director-General of the UN Atomic Energy Agency.
Dr. Lionel Mendis' exceptionally brilliant and comprehensive book on Cricket named Cricket HuruwaDiscipline and Practice of Cricket in Englishspeaks volumes of his knowledge, philosophy, mind power and the salient points of cricket.
Incidentally, at the book launch, which was held at St. Joseph's College auditorium, I was given the keynote address. The book contains lessons which were not written before by anyone in the world. It not only enlightened teachers, coaches and players of the game, but it was also an invaluable contribution of his insight, depth of knowledge and philosophy.
The manner in which he disciplined most players, including captain Arjuna Ranatunga since his school days towards bringing glory to our motherland, was testimony to his dedication. His strict principles helped many students to develop their careers.
Dr. Lionel Mendis hailed from a very reputed family from Ambalangoda and started his career as a teacher. He also once joined the Army Voluntary Force.
A teetotaler and vegetarian, he lived an exemplary life. He resigned from teaching and decided to train children and youths at his cricket academy and in no time, it became a famous coaching camp in the country.
The manner in which Dr. Lionel Mendis enrolled a newcomer to his academy was remarkable to witness. At interviews, he not only encouraged cricket, but also tested the individual's mathematics and English. His procedure of handling trainees was exceptional.
He was keen on dress codes as well and made sure that everything was clean. Due to these qualities, almost all reputed professionals were keen on sending their children to his cricket academy.
As a humble, but forceful personality, he treated all alike and gave his best advice to even strangers. He took a bold task to go and train the Northern Province players during the war-torn period where no other person dared to venture on such a dangerous assignment. He had faith in himself and did not hesitate to serve when required. Every year, he took his trainees to India to play with Indian cricketers to broaden their horizon of cricket and diplomacy. Nonetheless, before handing over his duties which he carried for more than three decades to a new coach at the NCC Cricket Academy, he gave a memorable speech to all the trainees, where I was also present. Though sadly, he had been suffering on the inside, he gave no sign of sickness. He expressed invaluable remarks and teachings at his last coaching service.
May you, Dr Lionel Mendis, enjoy the supreme bliss of Nibbana at the end of your journey in the cycle of sansara.
Dr. Jayantha Pathirana
Victoreen Hassan
She was aguiding light
It has been nine years since God called Victoreen to eternal rest. Victoreen passed away peacefully on the August 25, 2008. Gods fingers touched her and took her last breath, closed her eyes and slipped her away to the land of no more pain.
Victoreen was loving, caring and was the greatest blessing in my life. She gave life to our children and when I needed hope and inspiration, she was strong. We loved each other dearly and it broke my heart to lose her. Vicky, the day I first held you and kissed your sweet face are precious memories time cannot erase. Youre gone so far away and left me alone, my days and nights are turned so lonely, dear, since youve been gone.
I recall your tender smile and the lovely things you said when you and I were partners in life. I still remember what Victoreen told me when we decided to get married. What she told me was Kamil, marriages are made in heaven and if God wants our marriage to take place, no one can stop our marriage, even if anyone tries and that would be the day God unites us and we will be one.
With Gods blessings, we got married and spent almost forty long happy years together and then God gave her rest. What we shared together will not be forgotten and it lives in my heart. Although I am in sadness that Victoreen is no longer here, her influence still guides me every minute, every hour, and every day. I still feel she is beside me caring and guiding me.
We thanked our lucky stars we found each other. Hand-in-hand, we faced tomorrow with no fears. Now I face each day with hope and happy memories we shared together.It broke my heart to walk beside you on that fateful day, the day you were laid to rest. You gave me years of happiness; then came sorrow and tears. You left me with beautiful memories we shared through the years.
For long as my love and my memories live, my sadness goes on, as in my heart you are still living as every passing day goes by. You have gone from my sight, but not from my heart. The memories of you will remain forever. No words I write can ever say how much I think of you every day. I pray for you in silence every day and hold you close in my heart. You were my ever loving wife and your memory will always be with me.
Vicky, all I have are memories and your photo in a frame. For all you gave through the years, your time, your love, your prayers and your patience, caring and sharing and for all this and more, I still love you.You gave me something time can never take from me; a light to guide me when it gets dark and I can't see. These special memories of you always bring a smile to me. You will never be forgotten as long as I am living, as I carry you safely tucked within my heart and your light will always shine forever.
Finally, thank you Victoreen for the wonderful and generous sacrifices you made for me, our children, and all the loving care and affection you showered on us. I remember not what I did for you, but I was for you and you were for me. Thank you for loving me and being what you were.
Darling Vicky, our special years when you were with me will not return; but with the love within our hearts, you will walk with me forever.
Till we meet again; sadly missed by your loving husband.

A.R.M. Mansoor
Dedicated to his work
I take this opportunity to issue this message of deepest condolences over the irreparable loss of former minister A.R.M. Mansoor, also the Ambassador for the State of Kuwait and committed social worker who passed away on July 25 in Colombo. Janaza was buried in his own soil of Kalmunai.
I have had the privilege of associating with Mansoor from my school days when both of us received our secondary education at Shivananda Vidyalaya, Batticaloa.
Having had an illustrious career as an Attorney-at-Law, he entered politics representing the Kalmunai constituency and then was made the District Minister for the Mullaithivu District in 1989 and became the Minister of Trade and Commerce in 1990. Ultimately, he entered the Diplomatic Service as the Ambassador for the State of Kuwait in 1995.
I am proud to note that I had the opportunity of serving as his co-ordinating secretary during the period 1991 to 1994 when he was a Minister of Trade and Commerce.
I am personally aware of the sense of dedication with which set about attending to his tasks.
The people in the East are aware of the supreme role he played in establishing the National College of Education on May 10, 1992 at Addalaichenai, which opened up new vistas in the field of Education to the members of the younger generation in the country.
Mansoor also made use of his career as Ambassador for Kuwait in getting the assistance of many philanthropists in Kuwait to contribute liberally towards the renovations or constructions of several mosques in the East. Although he reached the highest pinnacles of success in his chosen careers, he did not forget his alma mater.
In keeping with my kind request, he saw to it that Shivananda Vidyalaya, Batticaloa, received Rs. 10 million through government assistance for the construction of the Swami Vipulanandaji memorial hall.
I was also serving as a consultant in administrative matters at the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka, Oluvil.
May almighty Allah bless him with jennathul firthous in the world hereafter.
A. L. Ibralebbe,
Retd. SLAS Divisional Secretary,
Addalaichenai
Navarathne Cabraal
A law-abiding citizen
At a time when forthright and fearless decision makers were few, Navarathne Cabraal rose to prominence and performed a yeoman service at all the institutions and organizations civil, as well as military he was destined to occupy.
A product of Piliyandala Central College, one of the educational institutions that came into being due to the Free Education Policy of the father of free education C.W.W. Kannangara, he completed his secondary education. Thereafter, he graduated from the Sri Jayawardenepura University.
He was a stritct disciplinarian which might have prompted him to join the Cadet platoon of Piliyandala Central College during his school career. He then moved on to reach the rank of a Captain in the Sri Lanka Army.
During his military career at the Sri Lanka Armed Forces, he won several awards in recognition of his dedication and commitment to the service.
The Presidential Inauguration Medal, Riviresa Campaign Medal and Volunteer Service Medal were some among the many he won. For a brief period of time after his graduation and his stint at the Government Teachers' Training College, he was attached to the Ministry of Education as a trained graduate teacher and then taught at Ananda College, Colombo, holding the post of Cadetting master.
Born into a respectable family of Piliyandala, he extended his helping hand to almost everybody who sought his assistance and drew satisfaction when their goals were achieved.
His demise took place at a time when it was least expected, exampling the fragile nature of life. With his demise, we lost a steadfast relative, a disciplined and law-abiding citizen and above all, a very good friend.
He leaves behind his beloved wife and three sons.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.
K.D. Jayatissa,

Asgiriya Mahanayake Thera praises Govt.s service to Buddhism
The great service rendered by the government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe towards creating a Buddhist revival by developing Buddhist temples in the country, came in for special praise by Asgiriya Chief Prelate Most Ven Warakapola Gnanaratana Mahanayake Thera.
The occasion was the laying of foundation stones for a new Dharmasala and Daham Pasala building at the Bodhimalkada Purana Viharaya, Udagunnepana on August 25.
The Asgiriya Chief Prelate said the Government was engaged in this commendable service even deploying the services of the forces and this service had been lauded by the Maha Sangha on many occasions.
The Mahanayake Thera said a programme was underway to develop access roads to nearly 300 temples and Dagobas in the country undertaken by Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella and this was a very prudent and timely intervention to supplement Dayaka Sabhas which could not muster sufficient funds for such work from the donations of their membership who were not that affluent.
The Chief Prelate said the governments active intervention to uplift Buddhism had also created a resurgence among the Buddhist public too.
Viharadhipathi, Mahiyangana Raja Maha Viharaya Ven. Urulewatte Dhammarakkhitha Thera, Ven Narampanawe Ananda Thera, Ven. Muruddeniye Dhammaratana Thera, Diyawadana Nilame of the Sri Dalada Maligawa Pradeep Nilanga Dela and the Basnayake Nilames of the four main devalayas in Kandy also participated.

Bangladesh spinners spoil strong day for Australia in Test
Dhaka: Bangladeshs spinners spoilt a strong day for Australia Sunday, claiming two quick wickets after the hosts had been dismissed for 260 on the first day of the first Test.
Pat Cummins, Nathan Lyon and Ashton Agar took three wickets each to wrap up the Bangladesh innings despite half-centuries from Tamim Iqbal and Shakib al Hasan.
But there was redemption for Bangladesh -- meeting Australia in a Test for the first time in over a decade -- when their spinners took two scalps in the final moments of the session. A third batsman was run out, leaving Australia precariously placed on 18-3 at stumps.
David Warner was given a reprieve by the third umpire from a lbw decision off Mehedi Hasan, but the spinner trapped the left-hander the same way with the very next ball.
Soumya Sarkar was responsible for a brilliant run out to remove Usman Khawaja for one in the next over, before left arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan dismissed nightwatchman Lyon for a duck.
Opener Mat Renshaw remained unbeaten on six at stumps along with skipper Steve Smith, not out three.
When the match got under way Australia looked unstoppable as Cummins rattled Bangladeshs top order with a fiery opening spell. Cummins struck in his first over when he dismissed Soumya Sarkar for eight, beating the left-hander with a short-pitched ball that took an edge and flew to Peter Handscomb at gully.
In his next over he removed Imrul Kayes and Sabbir Rahman for nought off successive deliveries to reduce Bangladesh to 10 for 3.
But Shakib and Tamim came together to add 155 for the fourth wicket and lift the home teams score towards respectability.
Tamim lofted Lyon for a six over extra cover, growing in confidence as he built the partnership with Shakib. Occasional spinner Glenn Maxwell finally broke it when he forced Tamim to cut one loose at backward point, where David Warner took the catch.
Tamim, who like Shakib was playing his 50th Test, made 71.
Shakib scored 84 including 11 fours before he was dismissed by Lyon on the stroke of tea, with Smith taking a sharp catch at first slip.
It was quite challenging to bat out there. I think Tamim and I applied ourselves, said Shakib. AFP

CA Sri Lanka takes lead in promoting importance of dynamism and agility in corporate leadership
CA Sri Lanka held a press conference on last week at the CA Sri Lanka Members Lounge on the 38th National Conference of Chartered Accountants, which is recognized as one of Sri Lankas largest business summits attracting over 1600 Chartered Accountants including business leaders, and bring together local and international speakers.
Businesses expected to become more dynamic and adapt to change continuously, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) will take the lead in promoting the important need for corporate leaders to embrace dynamism and agilityat the 38th National Conference of Chartered Accountants scheduled to be held in October this year.
The conference, which has built a reputation as one of Sri Lankas most sought after and highly attended annual business summits, will this year revolve around the theme Dynamism - Agility in Leadership. During the three day conference, from October 25 - 27, 2017 at BMICH, Colombo, both local and international speakers will steer the over 1600 delegates to think out of the box and understand why it is increasingly important to incorporate dynamism within the corporate culture in Sri Lanka and also look at developing more agile leaders, who understand the importance of changing with time, to ensure sustainable and successful corporates.
Addressing a press conference held in Colombo, President of CA Sri Lanka Lasantha Wickremasinghe said that as a country that belongs to the fastest growing region, Sri Lanka too can take great advantage of this exponential growth.
Although we are a small nation, we have the potential to become a global player due to our strategic location in the world map. But, to reach this goal, we need leadership with proper vision. We cannot only expect governments and policy makers to drive our country forward. As professionals, we too have responsibilities to support this forward journey, he said.
Therefore, Wickremasinghe explained that there is an increasing need to encourage agility across the broader spectrum, be it at a national level or corporate level. Because agility has been identified as an important factor that will drive a leadership to help achieve success, despite increasing volatility, uncertainty and complexity, he said.
Wickremasinghe also said that the technological revolution is another reason why more and more businesses as well as professionals and corporate leadership need to understand the need to adapt with time and stay relevant by being more agile and dynamic in maneuvering businesses.
The 38th National Conference theme was unveiled by Wickremasinghe in the presence of CA Sri Lankas Vice President, Jagath Perera, Chairman of the National Conference Committee, Tishan Subasinghe, Chairperson of the National Conference Technical Committee, Anoji De Silva and Chief Executive Officer, Aruna Alwis.
Chairman of the National Conference Committee, Tishan Subasinghe said that there is an increasing need to see more agility and dynamism among business leaders, who also comprise of Chartered Accountants.
Therefore, this years national conference will shed important insights on why its important to create agile leaders, who know when to adapt, and change with times and more importantly be flexible and move away from archaic mindsets. The national conference, is the perfect platform to help influence senior executives and business leaders, to understand the importance of an agile culture in an organisation as well the need to groom agile and dynamic leaders, who will not only enjoy individual professional success, but will also help their organisations progress, he said.
Subasinghe said last year the conference recorded the highest participation with a total of 1658 delegates taking part in it, which also included top business leaders. An important factor at last years conference was the demand by non-members of the institute to participate in the conference, but due to limited seating capacity, we could not accommodate the ever increasing demand, and so we also offer the option of transmitting the conference live via webcast, he added.
Delivering the rationale behind this years theme, Chairperson of the National Conference Technical Committee Anoji De Silva pointed out that as organizations grow it becomes increasingly difficult to change faster as managers tend to confine themselves in their comfort zones. To break these barriers and constantly challenge the status quo, organizations will require visionary leaders, and agile leadership is the most critical because without an agile leader it is unlikely that an organization can develop and inculcate an agile culture, she said.
De Silva also said that agility of few leaders in an organization would be of no value if most of the other decision makers are dinosaurs, and hence this is where the culture of agility becomes so important to ensure the momentum of change continues.
To survive in this highly volatile and complex world, firms must demonstrate agility in fulfilling customer expectations, product design and enhancement, collaborative innovation and organizational structures. Leaders need to develop a level of organizational agility that matches the increasing level of change and complexity in their business environment, she added. (DJ)

CILT Logistics Leaders Evening held
The Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transport (CILT) Sri Lanka Logistics Leaders Evening was held on August 2, 2017 with a lecture titled Chinas Belt & Road Initiative, a realization of an Aspiration by Professor Paul Tae-Woo LEE at the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka Auditorium.
Professor Paul Tae-Woo LEE is a Professor at the School of Business IT & Logistics and Leader of the One Belt One Road (OBOR) Research Lab in RMIT University Melbourne Australia. The presentation showcased a detailed explanation of the Belt & Road Initiative (BRI)  the depth and extensiveness of which is still little understood.
Professor LEE did mention that there are still no detailed studies on the impact of BRI, and currently only a shallow understanding prevails.
The key elements of the BRI included a fascinating network of infrastructure& city clusters aiming to restructure Chinas economic model and transportation network, as we currently know it. He also briefly touched on some of the various corridors such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, Greater Mekong Sub Region and China-Russia Corridor, all of which entail tremendous investments to set up physical infrastructure and modernizing trading networks.
The BRI has kicked off in Sri Lanka with two strong projects in the Colombo International Financial City and the Hambantota Port.
Certain areas that were mentioned where Sri Lanka would have to expand on would be how to set up progressive port policies for its future and there were several examples in the region like Singapore that could be used to benchmark. Interestingly, the BRI is looking to transform the economies of countries that it has targeted whilst providing job opportunities and uplifting living standards.
Forbes magazine recently quoted The allure of Hambantota to China is its location: right smack in the middle of the energy supply lines between the Middle East and East Asia; a logically positioned node in Xi Jinpings signature 21st Century Mariti me Silk Road an emerging network of new and enhanced seaports stretching from the coast of China to Africa, Europe, and beyond.
Like so, Hambantota has interests to China that extend far beyond the economic capacity of the port itself, as it is a key building block of the countrys long-term foreign policy vision which seems to make all the problems that have arose during its initial stages of development worth it.
CILT continues with its annual International Conference, which will be held on October 3, 2017 that will showcase several such internationally renowned speakers on several key topics it its endeavor to educate the key stakeholders in the shipping, logistics and transportation industry.

Threat to coconut growers
With much against the wishes of coconut growers a container load of husked coconuts were imported to the country. With pressure build up opposition the move and in accordance with the laws of the country, the consignment was not allowed to be cleared by customers. It is understood certain attempts are now been made to amend the Quarantine Act in order to allow free imports of coconuts.
At present coconut growers are faced with problems on mite infection; Weligama Leaf Wilt and Caterpillar infection in (Mundel area) and imports of Coconuts could add more problems. Therefore strict Quarantine Laws should be enforced to safeguard the coconut growing industry where 700,000 coconut growers are depending for their livelihood.
Also 70/80 per cent of the harvest is used for domestic consumption and any harm will create a political uprise in the country, bearing in mind coconut is the second stable diet of the average Sri Lankan next to rice.

Common gardening mistakes to avoid
Every gardener who has ever planted, pruned, or watered a plant has at some time in their life done it the wrong. Making mistakes is just part of being human. The trick is learning from each mistake, so unlike our government, you don't keep doing the same dumb thing over and over again.
Overwatering Your Plant
Result: The plant turns yellow, drops leaves, rots, or simply croaks.
Giving a plant too much water kills it faster than giving it too little. Although most plants prefer moist soil, they don't like soggy, poorly drained soil. Waterlogged soil keeps roots from functioning properly. Because of this, overwatered plants may wilt on a sunny day from too much water, not too little. To lessen your chances of overwatering, keep track of what you water, so you don't water the same plant 3 times a day. Separate plants that need lots of water from those that need just a little. Before you water, stick your finger about an inch deep into the soil near the base of the base to see if the soil is moist or dry.
Planting Too Deeply
Result: The plant's roots smother and the plant slowly dies.
Roots need air to breathe. They can't get it when they're buried 6 feet under. So when you plant a tree or shrub, make sure that the top of the root ball is slightly higher than the surrounding soil. To keep air from drying out the root ball, cover the top with and inch or so of mulch.
Overfertilizing
Result: Your plant grows too fast, refuses to bloom or fruit, becomes susceptible to disease, and may suffer fertilizer burn. Excess nutrients pollute ground water and streams.
Fertilizer is not "plant food." Fertilizer contains chemicals that enable leaves to make food from sunshine. Plants growing in fertile soil that contains lots of organic matter do not need frequent fertilization. Plants that are dormant or suffering from drought need no fertilizer at all.
Buy fertilizers formulated for your types of plants and apply at the rates specified on the label. Choose organic, slow-release fertilizers that work slowly over months at a time and actually improve the soil by adding organic matter.
Not Reading the Label
Result: Impending disaster.
Yeah, reading labels is boring stuff, but it's also essential, lest you exterminate your plants, pets, and yourself. Weed-killers won't kill bugs and bug-killers won't kill leaf spot, but both products could kill you if you don't use them properly.
So read the directions carefully. They'll tell you how much product to use, how and when to apply, what plants to use it on, and what pests it controls. And don't ever think if one tablespoon works great, two tablespoons work even better. The result is usually the opposite.
Pruning Flowering Trees and Shrubs at the Wrong Time
Result: No blooms.
Some plants make flower buds on new growth. Others make buds on growth from the previous year. Pruning at the wrong time removes flower buds - hence, no blooms.
So here's a simple rule - prune trees and shrubs that bloom from winter through May (azalea, camellia, forsythia, quince, oakleaf hydrangea, spirea, redbud, flowering cherry) in late spring or early summer. This gives them time to make new flower buds for next year. Prune those that bloom after May (crepe myrtle, chaste tree, rose-of-Sharon, butterfly bush, peegee hydrangea, gardenia, pomegranate) in late winter or early spring.
Planting Shade Trees Between the Sidewalk and Curb
Result: Tree roots lift and break the sidewalk.
Growing roots have incredible power and can easily crack concrete. This is guaranteed to happen if the space between your sidewalk and curb in less than 6 feet and you plant shade trees that grow big and have roots near the surface. Examples - Southern magnolia, oaks, maples, bald cypress, sycamore, sweet gum, and tulip poplar. Plant smaller, ornamental trees instead - crepe myrtle, redbud, dogwood, flowering cherry, crabapple, and orchid tree.
Buying Plants with Bugs on Them
Result: You bring home bugs that spread to your other plants. Know how most people get bugs on their houseplants, flowers, and shrubs When they buy the plants, they buy the bugs too. Garden centers and greenhouses are perfect places for bugs to multiply, because plants are so close together. Plus, they're sprayed so often that pests become resistant.
So thoroughly inspect any plant before you put it in your car. Pay special attention to flowers, flower buds, new foliage, and the undersides of leaves. Shake the plant to see if any bug flies off. If you find bugs, leave the plant there. -Garden.com

Dhashma Karunaratne heads South Asia  Gateway Terminals
Dhashma Karunaratne is the Commercial and Marketing Manager at South Asia Gateway (SAGT).
She contributes to the overarching Commercial and Marketing strategy and is accountable for tactical execution to achieve its strategic objectives.
A Fellow member of CIMA (UK) she commenced her career at Mercantile Investments in 1999 and moved to Fentons as the Companys Management Accountant. In 2005 she joined the Corporate Finance and Group Strategy Division of premier conglomerate John Keells Holdings and moved to MNC Reckitt Benckiser as The Commercial Controller in 2007.
Dhashma joined Team SAGT in 2009 as Manager - Management Accounting. When the vacancy for her current role arose in 2014, she grabbed the opportunity to broaden her professional scope.
She recalls the early days as being exciting and challenging. I came into the position at a time of increased competition in the port of Colombo. Our customers - the liner container industry, was experiencing unprecedented financial challenges she said. Additionally, there were other man made challenges imposed on our operating environment, as the port was not being positioned as one entity but rather divisively very inward looking she said.
Continuing on she said, However, working alongside the newly appointed Ted Muttiah as Chief Commercial Officer was inspiring, confronting, motivating and at times overwhelming. Ted needs no introduction of course; he brought international best practice, is highly driven and a master business strategist. He set high standards, led by example and challenged us to move out of our comfort zone and actualize our true potential. He was relentless in positioning SAGT as a customer focused high-performance organization. His imminent departure to a new assignment overseas, in my opinion, is a tremendous loss to Sri Lankas maritime industry she says reflectively.
Adding SAGT is privileged to have many highly capable women from the outset of the terminals concession. However, we need to gain the advantage of greater gender diversity across all levels of our business and this is very much one of the priorities under new CEO Romesh David
Dhashma is the current elected Chairperson of the Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transports arm of Women in Logistics and Transport. A role she took over from the ubiquitous Women in Logistics dynamo Gayani De Alwis.
These two partnership programs conceptualized and executed by Dhashma were commended by Women In Logistics and Transport International. Dhashma was recognized for her visionary leadership extended to WiLAT Sri Lanka, at the recently held CILT conference in Macau, Hong Kong.

Dispatch from Coney Island
I dont fish, but I enjoy being around those who do. Theyre easy to find in New York, leaning against the railing of a Brooklyn pier or resting on the rocky banks of the citys rivers. In Sheepshead Bay, the fishermen are often jolly and sun-beaten, as if theyve just returned from a long voyage. By early afternoon, they fill the local bars, swearing off red meat and bragging about not taking their medications. The Battery Park esplanade is more relaxed. Sometimes the only sign of a fisherman is an unmanned rod cast out to sea; a passerby might assume that fish in the Hudson catch themselves.
One August morning a few years ago, I went out to Coney Island to clear my head on Steeplechase Pier, where fishermen gather in the summer months to fill their buckets with flukes, stripers, and porgies, much as they did a century ago. Coney Island is slow to change. Its busier blocks still have working pay phones on both sides of the street, and until recently, broken signs dangled off the facades of abandoned buildings, unmoored from their bracings by Hurricane Sandy. On hot days, the main stretch of Coney Islands two-and-a-half mile boardwalk is crowded with visitors from the nearby amusement park.
Shade beneath
They eat mango on a stick as they navigate the performers dancing with snakes and rainbow-colored poodles. Down by the fishermens pier, the boardwalk quiets down. Elderly residents of the nearby towers read paperback novels and check the time on their digital wristwatches, and kids gather in the shade beneath the arches of an old terra-cotta building with a flaking portrait of Poseidon on the front. In the painting, the sea king is sitting alone in a rowboat, paddling toward the Atlantic.
I joined a group of fishermen on the pier who were digging through ten-gallon buckets and tackle boxes. A man named Sonny was sitting on a Rascal scooter, baiting his hook with chopped-up fish and squid he kept in the vehicles front basket. Another man, David, who looked to be in his late fifties, was leaning against the railing. As I sat down on a nearby bench, David noticed a tug on his line. He pulled up a fluke maybe ten inches long, too small to keep in New York State. He warned the others that city officials were known to inspect the fishermens bags and buckets when they came in from the pier at the end of the day.
As David removed the fish from his hook, a teenager sitting next to me on the bench jumped up. Let me buy it from you, he said.
David looked around. Just take it.
The teenager shoved the fish, which was flapping wildly, into a plastic bag. When the bag stopped moving, he put it in his backpack and sat back down.
Thats the last one for you, said David. He walked over to a bag tied to a nearby railing post and pulled out a bluefish, only a few inches long. He flattened it on the railing and sliced it into four pieces. He placed three of them back in the bag and baited his hook with the fourth.
The teenager began to panic. He pointed to two men in yellow vests walking down the pier.
Thirty years
Dont worry, said David. Theyre not from the city. The teenager struggled to hide his backpack beneath the bench. Im telling you they are not with the city, David repeated. I can read their bodies. Theyre drunk on warm beer.
Moments later the men sat down and removed two cans of beer from their bag. I know everything! David laughed. This is my corner. Ive been fishing here for thirty years. Looking out over the water, he told me about an evening, years ago, when thirty or so people arrived from Haiti to get baptized in the ocean. It was very interesting.
I asked if he had thought about joining them.
No. Out here, my spirit is free.

Eight women eye top spot at up-for-grabs US Open
NEW YORK AFP Aug27, 2017Serena Williams is about to have a baby and Victoria Azarenka will stay home with her infant son as she battles for custody -- leaving the US Open women's field in total suspense over who might win.
Eight players have a chance to leave the year's last Grand Slam with the world number one ranking, making the Flushing Meadows fortnight that starts Monday a tennis thriller, even without two of the sport's top stars.
Williams, who won her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open, announced in April she was pregnant and would miss the rest of the year. Serena is always the favorite when she plays and she's at a level on her own when she's playing her best tennis, Denmark's fifth-ranked Caroline Wozniacki said.
But we're here and I think everyone has a shot if they play their best. It's all about playing well for two weeks. Two-time Australian Open winner Azarenka revealed she is battling with her son's father for custody, and the child thus cannot leave California, so she opted to stay.
Former world number one Maria Sharapova, a five-time Grand Slam champion, will play as a wildcard in her first major tournament since a 15-month doping ban after testing positive for meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open.
And while the Russian's return has been hit by forearm and thigh injuries, she remains a threat.
Just ask Romania's second-ranked Simona Halep, who faces her in the first round having lost all six of their prior meetings. Czech world number one Karolina Pliskova, Halep, Wozniacki, Wimbledon champion and world number three Garbine Muguruza, Ukraine's fourth-ranked Elina Svitolina, Britain's Johanna Konta and Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova all have a chance to become world number one at the US Open.
Evergreen Venus Williams, the 37-year-old American who has won seven Grand Slam titles and was runner-up this year at Wimbledon and the Australian Open, is ranked ninth but also could become number one again -- by winning the title.
Defending champion and sixth-ranked Angelique Kerber of Germany can't finish the week atop the rankings but she could hoist the crown again as the only past winner from the past decade in the field.
Muguruza has made herself an oddsmaker's darling after taking last year's French Open, last month's Wimbledon crown and last week's Cincinnati title. But she hasn't gone past the second round in four tries at New York. - AFP

Feeder service between Colombo and Bangladesh soon - Yamuna Wettasinghe
A feeder service between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh would commence soon, said Assistant General Manager of Ceylon Shipping Corporation Ltd, Yamuna Wettasinghe speaking to Daily News Biz Shipping.
During the state visit of President Maithripala Sirisena last July, a MoU between Ceylon Shipping Corporation and Bangladesh Shipping Corporation was signed to operate a feeder service between Colombo and Chittagong. To commence this project, we will join with a partner on public-private partnership (PPP) basis, who can deploy vessels for this feeder sector, she said.
We are planning to resume the passenger ferry service between Colombo and Tuticorin soon.
This service facilitates passenger movements as well as cargo movements and vehicles between Sri Lanka and India. CSC intends to work with a suitable and experienced partner to operate this cargo cum passenger service between Colombo and Tuticorin, she said.
We are conducting maritime training facilities for Sri Lankan cadets on our own two ships (Ceylon Breeze and Ceylon Princess) as well as on third party vessels. We do have a cadet training berth in our vessels which can accommodate 26 cadets at a given time.
These two ships can provide training facilities for 52 cadets. CSC intends to increase cadet training opportunities to Sri Lankan youth in terms of expanding its fleet of vessels at a right time in untapped business areas appropriately, she said.
Shipping is not only the transport of goods or passengers by sea. It covers vast areas. Ceylon Shipping Corporation is the national carrier of Sri Lanka and our scope is to purchase, build, charter and hire vessels and also to engage in other shipping related businesses, she added.

Fifty and out as Mayweather stops brave McGregor
LAS VEGAS AFP Aug27, 2017Floyd Mayweather outclassed Conor McGregor with a 10th-round stoppage here Saturday to win their money-spinning superfight and clinch his 50th straight victory.
Former welterweight boxing champion Mayweather, who had emerged from a two-year retirement to take on the Irish mixed martial arts star, took his time to get going before dominating from the fourth round.
The end came with a tired McGregor doubled over on the ropes as Mayweather landed two hard left hooks, prompting referee Robert Byrd to intervene and declare a technical knockout. \It was an explosive finale to their much-hyped contest at the T-Mobile Arena which proved surprisingly competitive in the early rounds as McGregor managed to land a string of scoring punches.
But once Mayweather began to find his range and McGregor wearied rapidly, there was only going to be one winner. The 40-year-old American scored at will after the fourth round, snapping back McGregor's head with a series of stinging blows. McGregor somehow survived an onslaught in the seventh round when a right counter from Mayweather staggered him badly.
Finally McGregor's resistance broke in the 10th when a Mayweather right sent him lurching across the ring.
A hard left put him on the ropes and another hook saw him bent over and helpless, prompting the stoppage.
The fight had followed a largely expected script but McGregor, in his first ever boxing appearance, by no means embarrassed himself.
Mayweather will now head into what he says is a permanent retirement with a perfect 50-0 record, one better than heavyweight legend Rocky Marciano. The American is also expected to be around $200 million wealthier, taking his career earnings to around $1 billion.
McGregor, who was an unemployed former plumber four years ago before emerging as one of the biggest stars of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, is expected to earn around $100 million. - AFP

First ever ESI in Sri Lanka completed
Sri Lanka Navy facilitated the preparation of the first ever Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) in Sri Lanka recently. The project from Colombo to Negombo was successfully completed with the collaboration of the Sri Lanka Navy, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and other Sri Lankan stakeholders, the Navy media unit said.
The ESI maps provide a concise summary of coastal resources that are at risk if an oil spill occurs. When an oil spill occurs, ESI maps can help responders to meet their main objectives; the reduction of environmental consequences of the spill and the commencement of cleanup efforts.
This project was initiated consequent to the South Asia Regional Oil Spill Response Workshop held in Colombo in November 2014. The Sri Lanka Coast Guard (SLCG) made a formal request to the United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) seeking assistance and the USACE, as the primary US Department of Defense element, was assigned accordingly to partner with Sri Lanka on the project.
The Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) acted as the focal point and facilitator of the project. A series of discussions were held with the representatives of the US Embassy, USACE, SLN, SLCG and other local stakeholders prior to the commencement of the project.
The project was started in July 2016 and conducted in three phases. A number of local government organizations assisted the project by providing data for the database. SLN Hydrographers and GIS specialists and the representatives from the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), National Aquatic Resources Agency (NARA), Central Environment Authority (CEA), Coast Conservation Department (CCD) and students of Ruhuna and Wayamba Universities assisted the field work in the second phase. Justin Pummel and Benton Ching of the USACE provided the technical assistance and training to Sri Lankan field work teams.
They processed the data to develop the atlas and Geo database. The ESI Atlas was handed over to the Sri Lankan stakeholders in Colombo on August 21. A training workshop was held for the technical level officials of the stakeholders to train them in using the ESI Atlas and the database if any oil spill occurs.

The Three-judge-bench comprised of Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Sisira de Abrew and Justice Anil Goonaratne.
 At a previous occasion, the Attorney General was given further time to seek a possibility of releasing funds from several frozen bank accounts belonging to Udayanga Weeratunga following his request to do so.
 On October 20 last year, the Colombo Fort Magistrate issued a warrant written in English through the Interpol to arrest UdayangaWeeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa over a financial fraud which was alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack crafts for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA).
 Udayanga Weeratunga filed this petition through his mother-in-law Latha Indrani, the power of attorney holder of the petitioner.
 In his petition, Udayanga Weeratunga has stated that he is currently residing in Mekhanizatoriv Street Kyiv, Ukraine.
 The petitioner further sought an Interim Order restraining the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank from suspending the petitioners bank accounts and continuing to suspend the bank accounts.
 The petitioner stated that the seventh respondent, a Chief Inspector of the FCID had moved Magistrates Court for a warrant for the arrest of the petitioner.
The petitioner sought a declaration from the Court that the Chief Inspector infringed the petitioners Fundamental Rights guaranteed in terms of Articles 11, 12(1) and 13 of the constitution.
 The petitioner further said the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank has infringed his Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Constitution by the purported decision to suspend debit transactions from the bank accounts of the petitioner in contrary to the provisions of the Financial Transaction Reporting Act No. 6 of 2006.
 In his complaint to the FCID, journalist Iqbal Athas stated that he had written several articles regarding the financial irregularities that had taken place in procuring four Mig-27 aircrafts at a higher price. He told the police that these ground attack aircrafts were manufactured between 1980 and 1983.
 President's Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for the petitioner.

Govt targets US$ 1.5 bn from spice and allied product exports

Strengthening the countrys spice and allied products export sector is the next step of the Government to achieve a remarkable foreign exchange target of US$ 1500 million.
Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage made these remarks at the 33rd AGM of the Spices and Allied Products Producers and Traders Association (SAPPTA) held in Colombo.
Highlighting the invaluable service rendered by the SAPPTA and all other stakeholders of the countrys spice and allied producers, Minister Gamage said Sri Lanka generates a massive foreign exchange from cinnamon and pepper even at present.
He said due to the sacrifice of cultivators cinnamon growers reap better harvest without spending a lot of money on fertilizer. Quoting statistics, Minister Gamage said cinnamon has become one of Sri Lankas leading exports and their next target was to manufacture value added products to achieve a remarkable export market.
 Currently we export cinnamon to 13 countries and among them 52 percent is exported to Mexico, he said.
Speaking further on cinnamon, the minister said even doctors have experimented that cinnamon and locally grown bitter gourd (Karawila) are used to manufacture a medicine to cure cancer. He also focused special attention towards large extent of bare lands and requested cultivators to grow valuable spices in such land considering that there will be a good local and foreign market to these products.
He said the SPPAP also to encourage cultivators to grow more spices without expecting the Governments involvement.Talking about the countrys export income Minister Gamage said that the Government recorded a 38 percent export income in 2005 and that has come down to the position of 14 percent at present and requested all persons to encourage spice cultivators to go for a better target again.
The Minister also said the Government has also planned to develop the countrys spice industry by granting the cultivators with a low interest rate of 6.8 percent and the balance interest is borne by the government.He also mentioned that the Government has also planned to help at least 1,800 spice industrialists with the assistance of World bank.
While thanking the encouraging speech made by Minister Gamage, SAPPTA , Chairman Vernon Abeyratne said although land areas and quantities of spices are limited in the country, its products are of high quality. Now we have to encourage value addition of our spices to achieve a higher value for our limited quantities of spices of high quality.
He further said we have to increase our yield to meet the increasing world demand and promote plantation companies to utilize their unproductive lands for cultivation of other spices such as Cocoa, Garcinia, lemon, ginger, turmeric and cashew.
He also mentioned about the forthcoming annual session of the International Pepper Community (IPP) which will be held in Sri Lanka from October 30 to November 2 , 2017 at Earls Regency Hotel, Kandy.

Grain drain: should everyone adopt a gluten-free diet
Its hard to imagine a high-street fashion chain selling something that jokily referenced irritable bowel syndrome or a nut allergy. Yet last year, Zara brought out a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan: Are you gluten-free Understandably, coeliacs  those people who cannot process gluten  were furious over what they saw as a trivialising of their condition, and the chain was forced to apologise and pull the item. The implication was clear: gluten-free diets were a trend  something for the fashion conscious to buy into, rather than a medical necessity.
The many celebrities who avoid gluten for non-medical reasons dont help: Victoria Beckham is said to follow a gluten-free diet because it helps her keep her weight down, while Gwyneth Paltrow writes in her book Its All Good that every single nutritionist, doctor and health-conscious person I have ever come across  seems to concur that [gluten] is tough on the system and many of us are at best intolerant of it and at worst allergic to it. Miley Cyrus, who once labelled gluten crappp, is evangelical about the benefits of giving it up: Everyone should try no gluten for a week. The change in your skin, physical and mental health is amazing.
The wellness brigade is, of course, no big fan of gluten either  the Hemsley sisters describe it as a common gut irritant. Even the world of professional sport has forsaken the traditional carb-loading pasta parties. Most pro-cycling teams are now on gluten-moderate diets, and Novak Djokovic credits his rise to superstardom to a Serbian doctor who diagnosed a gluten sensitivity just by watching the tennis player on television, and then persuaded him to cut it out of his diet. He immediately felt better, Djokovic says: I was lighter, quicker, clearer in mind and spirit  I could tell, the moment I woke up each morning, that I was different than I had been, maybe since childhood. I sprang out of bed, ready to tear into the day ahead.
In the foreword to Serve to Win, the gluten-free diet book Djokovic subsequently released to inspire the rest of us to follow suit, cardiologist Dr William Davis writes that modern varieties of wheat, quite apart from their propensity to contribute to everything from ulcerative colitis to schizophrenia, have the potential to cripple performance, cloud mental focus and bring a champion to his knees.
With press like that its little wonder that 8% of us report avoiding gluten as part of a healthy lifestyle, compared to just 5% of the British population that does so because of an allergy or intolerance. According to Mintel, 12% of new food products launched in the UK in 2015 were gluten free  Sainsburys almost doubled the number of products in its Freefrom aisle last autumn  while global sales of gluten-free foods jumped 12.6% in 2016 to $3.5bn. That is an awful lot of rice crackers.
But what is this bogeyman, this modern poison, as Dr David Perlmutter, author of the hugely successful, if widely derided, book Grain Brain, terms it For all its terrifying reputation, gluten is nothing more than a couple of proteins found in wheat and other cereals that help give bread, pasta and so on their characteristic structure and texture. When dough is kneaded, the protein strands stretch out and interlink to form a strong, but elastic network that traps air and helps bread to rise.
The reason that bread made from wheat flour is so much lighter and taller than, say, an all-rye loaf is that the gluten in wheat is particularly suited to the task.
About 1% of the UK population is thought to suffer from coeliac disease, a serious auto-immune condition (rather than the 5% with an intolerance or allergy) in which the body mistakes substances in gluten for threats, and attacks them, damaging the surface of the intestines and thus the ability to absorb nutrients. This is why, as well as abdominal pain and bloating, symptoms often include fatigue and unexpected weight loss. The disease appears to be becoming more common, although no one is sure why. If you are worried you might be affected, then consult your doctor as soon as possible, before it can do any more damage.

Halt this trend
A very interesting observation was made during a TV talk show the other day by onetime police spokesman, during the Rajapaksa regime, SP Prishantha Jayakody, who, however, was forced to quit his post for not carrying out an illegal order. The former cop said that the police today, for some reason or other, fail to act against unruly supporters of Joint Opposition politicians who are brought before courts or taken in for questioning, before investigation bodies. What is more, these elements are today even invading police headquarters and challenging the authority of the law.
The ex-police officer made special reference to former first son Namal Rajapaksa, who, he said, openly threatened a police officer when he (Namal) accompanied his mother Shiranthi to the CID the other day. He noted that Namal had in a threatening gesture bawled at the police officer that they (the Rajapaksas) will be in power, come December, and that all those police officers who were carrying out orders of the Yahapalanaya government, to persecute the Rajapaksas, will be looked after api thamuselawa balagannang.
The former police spokesman said the conclusion was inescapable that the law enforcement officers were harbouring fears that the Rajapaksas will be back in the saddle soon and were hesitant in taking action against those unruly elements accompanying a Rajapaksa family member to court houses or investigating bodies. He noted that the police looked on passively when the Rajapaksa supporters, transported from all parts of the country to express solidarity with the former First Lady, while taken to be grilled at the CID headquarters, behaved in an unruly manner hurling abuse at the law enforcement officers on duty. He said such daring was unthinkable under the former regime and wondered as to why things have taken such a turn, with no regard or respect shown to court houses or the law enforcement agencies. No doubt, a dangerous culture is taking shape, where, very soon the public will come to lose respect towards our courts and treat the premier law enforcement authority in the country with nonchalance leading to the emergence of lawlessness. The police should act firm and nip this trend in the bud before the practice catches on. No individual is bigger than the law, be it a former President or a First Lady, who on this occasion was hailed as Viharamahadevi by the boisterous crowd.
True, the police in recent times have been acting as passive spectators amid acts of defiance. Several court houses have been invaded and desecrated by those in robes, but the law has been helpless to prevent such happenings. Not just with the unruly supporters of the Joint Opposition politicians, the police have also been lenient even with regard to student protestors and other demonstrators. There was once a scene on TV showing a Bikkhu protestor tearing off a court order, banning a demonstration, from the hand of a police officer and stamping on it with his foot. No action was taken against the perpetrator while the court was being held in contempt. There had been numerous other instances where the police were virtually being overpowered by boisterous demonstrators, with little or no retaliation, whatsoever, and the offenders living to fight another day.
The situation can only get worse in the coming days, given the spate of court cases being lined up against the members of Joint Opposition and former VIPs. There are bound to be mass invasions of the court houses and investigation bodies, of the type witnessed the other day when Shiranthi Rajapaksa was brought to the CID headquarters. The police should be prepared to deal firmly with any eventuality, without permitting our court houses and law enforcement premises to be run roughshod over. What, pray, is the use of a police department when its own headquarters is lain siege over by the riffraff
It is time that Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka issued specific instructions to the police to deal firmly with the miscreants who attempt to undermine state authority. Court houses and police headquarters should be declared out of bounds to crowds accompanying politicians. No mercy should be shown against those challenging the authority of the law. This should also include Bikkhus who stir up trouble. Like the former police spokesman observed in the talk show, Mahinda Rajapaksa is precluded from becoming President again. Hence there is no possibility of his staging a comeback to take to task police officers not to the liking of the Rajapaksas. The police should therefore act without fear in enforcing the law. In any event no police officer can be penalized for performing his legitimate duties, whether or not, Rajapaksa will return to power. They have the protection of the countrys legal system.
No person, however powerful, should be allowed to threaten a police officer. It is unclear as to why Namal Rajapaksa was allowed this luxury. The IGP should launch an inquiry in this regard and even take to task the officer concerned, for allowing the authority of the police to be challenged in this manner.

Hamilton equals Schumacher record with 68th pole
SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium, Saturday  Lewis Hamilton roared to a record-equalling 68th career pole position on Saturday, matching Michael Schumacher's record in qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix.
The 32-year-old three-time world champion will start Sunday's race, the 200th of his career, from his sixth pole this year with Germany's championship leader Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari alongside him in second.
Hamilton's lap in 1min 42.553sec was the all-time record fastest at the spectacular Spa-Francorchamps circuit in the forests of the Belgian Ardennes, 0.242 seconds quicker than Vettel. The 68th pole position for the Mercedes driver drew him level in the record books with seven-time champion Schumacher whose congratulations were conveyed to him immediately afterwards by former Ferrari and Mercedes technical director Ross Brawn.
Briton Brawn, who guided Schumacher to all seven of his titles with Benetton (two) and Ferrari (five), hugged Hamilton on the track and said he had a special message.
I am here to deliver a special message from the Schumacher family who want to congratulate you on equalling Michael's record, said Brawn. He always said records are there to be beaten and they want to say a special thanks.
Hamilton, who appeared to be visibly moved with emotion, said: First, a big shout to the fans here  I cant believe it. A big thank you to my team.
Ross was a big part of that. This is one of my favourite circuits so to put a lap together like that is like a dream.
To hear that message which Ross just gave... a big thank you.
I pray for Michael and his family all the time. I have always admired him and I still do today. I am honoured to be there with him now on the pole positions, but he will still be one of the greatest of all time. - AFP

Herbal healing!
Kola Kanda is a nutritious homemade potion with remarkable healing properties. Garden Talk speaks to District Agriculture Instructor, Office of the Deputy Provincial Agriculture Director, Ratmalana, Thanuja Jeewandara on this healthy concoction which is easily brewed for daily consumption.
For a healthy lifestyle, mental and physical fitness is important. But this is not only limited to the food we consume. We need clean air, clean water and nutrients. We get these nutrients through food. With the lifestyles of todays society we must not be too concerned about its prices or availability. We must choose food that is high in nutritional value  protein and vitamins. For this we can use a home garden.
We can grow vegetables and fruits right here in our home gardens. If we grow vegetables and fruits in our home gardens it will be free from poisonous chemicals and it will be fresh. For the daily consumption a woman needs 1500  2000 calories. For a man it is slightly more. This can be done by growing fruits and vegetables in the home garden. Kola Kanda can be made using these home grown plants, said Jeewandara.
There are many varieties of Kola Kanda. Some are -Hathawariya, Wel Penala, Iramusu, Monarakudumbiya, Polpala, Kohila, Karapincha (curry leaves), Elabatu Kanda, Gotukola, Mukunuwenna

Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Malaysia A. J. M. Muzammil visited the Mahindarama Temple in Penang, Malaysia, recently, where the second mobile service was conducted.

How to construct a foundation of trust
Trust and credibility are important in any relationship and can make or break personal or professional reputations. They are cornerstones to all social and professional associations and are right at the foundation of the survival and success of any affiliations.
Yet, given the importance of trust in any relationship, business or personal, it is surprising how often it is absent in managerial relationships. Trust, after all, is a powerful force that builds loyalty, increases credibility and supports effective communications. It gives one the benefit of the doubt in situations where one wants to be heard, understood and believed.
Considering decisions
In the world of business today, trust is more important than ever, especially when it comes to your relationships with your clients, customers, employees and all stakeholders in your enterprise. In the business world, your credibility is everything. It tells people whether they can count on you. It tells your customers, employees, bosses and co-workers what they can expect from you. Whether they can trust you or not.
Over time, that becomes your reputation. It becomes one of the most important factors in determining how far you go in your career. Your credibility is largely a function of the perceived gap between what you say and what you do. If your actions match your words, you might go places. If they don't, look out below.
Trust is one of the most important elements for an effective, efficient and harmonious workplace crucial to business success for not only your employer but yourself in terms of professional development.
Your credibility as a leader is gained by remaining loyal to your subordinates and watching out for their best interests. If the company is considering decisions that could result in a cut in pay or job losses, you need to stand up for your staff and work to find solutions that can help them retain their jobs. Loyalty from a manager results in the staff returning the sense of commitment to achieve mutual success.
Indeed, your ability to trust others and to be trusted in turn is a talent and skill that must be nurtured to its full potential. There is nothing more exasperating or counter-productive, than when someone makes a commitment to do something and then fails to follow through. Reliability is an important ingredient in establishing credibility. Besides, you cannot fake credibility, at least not for long. You can sometimes seem credible at first even when you are not reliable, but the illusion doesn't last.
The yes-men
Being trustworthy essentially means being honest, even if you feel the situation and the individuals involved do not initially merit it. When you build a reputation for honesty, you are also building integrity and credibility, truly, two aspects of relationships essential in building trust.
Say what you mean and mean what you say. This is a maxim that you must apply every day of the week instead of in select situations. Your words must be backed up by your actions, be it in submitting reports on time or in acting on a complaint. Trust is more about what we should expect from your business in the future. Credibility is only one attribute required to gain trust. Trust is hard to gain and easy to lose. So understanding the importance of trust and how to develop and keep it can make a huge impact in business.
Some people foolishly act like they know everything. They can never, ever be wrong. They just have to show how smart they are. Its funny really! Smart, experienced people know how much they don't know. And those people will see right through you when you act like a know-it-all.
We all occasionally have to spin, pivot, deflect or redirect complicated issues. That's fine when exigencies demand such manoeuvring. But in the name of everything holy never resort to flat out lies. It's not about morals or ethics. It's purely pragmatic advice. When you get caught, and you will, it will ruin your credibility.
Yes, and we come to the yes-men as well. They sugar-coat the truth and tell people what they think they want to hear. They are also slippery customers. Those people have zero credibility. It may work in government bureaucracies, but not in well-run businesses.
Credibility as a leader allows your subordinates to look at you as a reliable resource for information and decision making. A leader with credibility gains the respect of his peers and staff by displaying strong, positive attributes. Credibility can translate into improved staff performance under your guidance and effective relationships with clients.
Humour and humility
To establish credibility, a leader must be accountable for his decisions and his actions. When a leader makes a mistake, he owns up to it and takes the steps necessary to correct the error. Delegating responsibility and showing trust in the ability of your subordinates is an important factor in developing credibility as well. Showing trust in their skill and their ability to perform a designated task develops confidence in your ability to manage the team.
One of the biggest mistakes certain leaders make is being full of themselves or acting self-importantly. Ego trips are certainly not on because such behaviour is generally a sign of immaturity and that damages their credibility. With experience comes wisdom, and with wisdom comes the knowledge that the world doesn't revolve around you and you alone. You must realise that you are not nearly as smart or important as you thought you were when you were younger.
That is why humour and humility are such important leadership traits.
Remember that credibility is serious stuff. That is because your reputation is at stake. It follows you wherever you go.
A reputation and credibility is hard to build but easy to destroy. Don't take it for granted. If you suffer some chronic hang-ups, start working on them now, before you do some things you can't undo.
The first job of any leader is to inspire trust. Trust is confidence born of two dimensions, mainly character and competence. Character includes your integrity, motive and intent with people. Competence includes your capabilities, skills, results and track record.
Both dimensions are vital. With the increasing focus on ethics in our society, the character side of trust is fast becoming the price of entry in the new global economy.
However, the differentiating and often ignored side of trust, competence, is equally essential. You might think a person is sincere, even honest, but you won't trust that person fully if he or she doesn't get results.
And the opposite is true as well. A person might have great skills and talents and a good track record, but if he or she is not honest, you are not going to trust that person either.
Well articulated and communicated vision may still fail to inspire people into action, if leaders fail to walk the talk. Living the values and enabling people to live by them is the area where successful leaders outclass others.
Great leaders inspire people and bank on them to take the organisation to a higher plane of performance by creating an environment of trust and empowerment.

How to make time for reading
One of the questions I get asked the most is how do you find time to read so much I have small kids, a full time job, and a writing habit that I sustain, but reading is one of those things that I need, like water and sunlight. When I stop picking up books, my mental health is affected, so Ive had to find ways to make the time. My best trick is to bring a book with me on the elliptical machine the exercise and chance to dive into a story both leave me feeling strong and happy.
Recent Book Riot Insiders newsletters gave a peek into the day-to-day of Book Riot back office superstars, and I loved hearing how they crafted time in their schedules to read. It made me wonder how other voracious readers feed their habit. Whether youre looking to up your reading time or you already have a day packed with bookish goodness, this look into the time-saving tricks of other Rioters is interesting!
Jamie Canaves: I sneak reading into as many things as I can all day long: audiobook on speaker while I get ready in the morning; audiobook with earbuds while I cook and play with dog; I usually read on my ereader while I eat breakfast and lunchand if no one notices during dinner sometimes; if Im watching a movie that turns out to not be that great I bust out whatever book Im reading and let it play in the background instead because I dont have time for underwhelming or crappy movies when Im reading a great book; eliminating from my TiVos season pass any shows I dont love or look forward to also made a huge space of time for more reading; and when I need/want to sit down in peace and read I put my phone in a drawer far from me so I dont have distractions (answering texts, checking social media constantly etc really eats up reading time).
Steph Auteri: Like most Book Rioters (I assume), I get creative about finding the tiny crevices of time in my life in which I might read at least a few pages: when Im drying my hairin the few minutes before yoga class begins. I even leave my house a little bit early when I go to pick up my daughter from preschool so I have a few minutes of alone time in my car. Whats made the biggest difference, though, is breaking up with most of my regular TV shows. I used to watch TV with my husband every evening, before bed. But when I stopped to think about it, what I really wanted to be doing was reading.
Melissa Baron: I make sure I always have a book in my bag when I leave the apartment; that way, I end up reading on the train, in waiting rooms for doctor or dentist appointments, or even in line for something. I also shuffled my schedule around so I go see my therapist when hes downtown instead of near my work, which is about a 45-minute subway ride for me. I get a lot of great reading time in for those visits. Ive just started to listen to audiobooks for commutes and plane rides (I have no idea why its taken me this long to do that). Beyond that, Ive been trying to limit my TV watching and reserve some time before bed to read. I also dont force myself to keep reading a book Im not in love with, which will just turn into another excuse to put off reading for a few days. Ill pick up another, and then have a few books going at the same time.
Elizabeth Allen: I actually found that I started reading more once I had my daughter. I earned to read smarter once my free time was being imposed on by a tiny, adorable little tyrant. I discovered the glory of listening to audiobooks while emptying the cat litter. I have perfected the art of reading while drying my hair. I started a hard and fast personal rule that the time between when I put my daughter to bed and when my husband serves dinner is solely reserved for reading. Instead of gossiping with coworkers during lunch in the office, instead I am completely anti-social and stuff food into my gob while staring at my current book. I read using the Amazon Cloud Reader (less conspicuous than a hardcover sitting on my desk) while Im dialed into a particularly boring online training or am waiting for a client to join me for a call. Its true, I rarely have long reading sessions like I used to before I became a parent, but those small, stolen moments add up really quickly!
Rachel Manwill: Now that I no longer have a commute and my audiobook time diminished significantly, Ive had to find other places to squeeze in reading. I listen to 30 minutes or so while Im getting ready in the morning. I read in snatches between meetings or during slow moments at work by using the Amazon Kindle web-based cloud reader. I avoid TV for an hour when I come home and sit down with a book instead. Its been an adventure trying to figure out other places to make up for the lost two hours of audiobook time a day, but Im finding all these other spaces where I wasnt reading before that I had lost.
Mal Soto: Lifehack that train ride! I love trains. I love my garbage hellscape of a commute to work, but I love it because I come prepared. I usually have at least one book in the backpack I take to work and an arsenal of books on my iPhone, so I could theoretically be trapped underground for a few days and still have something to read. Those minutes before and after work are where I read best, so if Im not jammed directly under someones armpit, its a great time.Short stories. I love short stories with all my heart and one of the benefits of reading them is that I can finish an entire story during my commute or lunch break. Added benefit You can find some amazing short stories online, so in those small moments at work where I need to reset my brain in order to function, I have something waiting for me thanks to the internet. When I was younger I was a
Strange Horizons fanatic, but nowadays I hop over to
Electric Literature to see whats new or check in on Joey Comeaus Patreon page. Bonus: Once short stories became my bread and butter I was discovering
new authors, often browner and queerer and a little more like me. - Book Riot

India-Lanka ODI betting racket busted, three bookies held
The City Crime Branch busted a cricket betting racket and arrested three bookies accepting bets on the one-day international (ODI) match played between India and Sri Lanka, from an office in D N Nagar, Andheri, on Friday night.
Police said the bookies had links in Ahmedabad, Delhi and Dubai.
The ODI series between India and Sri Lanka started on August 20. In recent test matches played from July 26 to August 12, India won three of four matches while one match was drawn. Acting on a tip-off, the Crime Branch Unit 9 raided a commercial building and arrested three persons - Deepak Ravi Kapoor, Tarun Sunny Thakur, and his cousin Sunny Ashok Thakur.
The police said Kapoor, who runs a real estate consultancy as a front, was the kingpin of the gang and was a small-time punter before becoming a full-time bookie recently. Police have seized 13 cellphones, two laptops, computers, a diary with details of clients and Rs 74,000. The accused have booked under the Gambling Act and for forgery as they had 13 mobile and SIM cards registered in another's name.
Advocate Mane Shinde, who appeared for the accused, said the SIM cards belonged to Kapoor's employees. Sources said the accused were taking bets from punters and dealing with counterparts in Ahmedabad and Delhi. "We've sought call detail reports to know as to who they were in touch with," a source said.

JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, stating that his party would vote in favour of the No-Confidence Motion against Health Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne, insisted that changing ministerial portfolios would not be the answer to the problems cropped up in the country today.
He was addressing the media at the JVP headquarters in Battaramulla yesterday. MP Dissanayake pointed out that the failure lies in the socio-economic system and not in the Government or its ministers.
Changing Cabinet ministers like musical chairs will hardly serve the purpose. The countrys current state of affairs reflects the failure of our socio-economic policies. We stand for a change in our economic policy. As a short term measure, we are supporting the NCM against Minister Senaratne, he said.
The JVP Leader said Minister Senaratne should not meddle with the issue of SAITM as his daughter-in-law was studying at the SAITM. The minister has a conflict of interest when it comes to the SAITM. He is not suited to hold that ministerial portfolio because of the host of other charges levelled against him. The pertinent question is whether it is only him. Almost all the other ministers too have multiple allegations, he said.
MP Dissanayake emphasized the need to present the National Audit Bill in the House to empower the Auditor General to fight against waste, corruption and fraud.

Karadiyana Waste to Energy Project inaugurated
The ground breaking ceremony of the Waste to Energy Project at Karadiyana was held recently with the attendance of President Maithripala Sirisena,
Fairway Waste Management, a subsidiary of Fairway Holdings, was awarded the project by the Government to establish the waste to energy plant together with the Waste Management Authority. At present, Karadiyana receives approximately 500 tons of waste per day from municipalities such as Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia, Kesbewa and Maharagama. The site is currently managed by the WMA and operates as an open dumping area, resulting in many negative environmental, social and health issues.
The proposed cutting edge waste processing site brings together international consultancy and local expertise to produce the most environmental friendly and sustainable waste processing solution. The plant is a hybrid design that minimizes the amount of waste that is thermally treated. While reducing the waste diverted to landfills, the plant will also recover the nutrients in the waste returning it to earth as fertilizer and the energy content will be transformed into electricity to be distributed to consumers. The process will work in stages of Mechanical Sorting, Biological Processing Plant, and Mass Burn Incineration.
Speaking at the event, Chief Minister of Western Province, Isura Devapriya stated, The garbage issue has become a national issue at present. Until now we have settled for short term solutions which have been detrimental. We have now stepped into long term solutions and transformed Waste Collection into Waste Management. Taking it a step further, we have initiated this Waste to Energy project. We are grateful to corporates such as Fairway Holdings for stepping up to invest in such national projects.
When I took over, the situation was much different,observed Patali Champika Ranawaka, Minister of Megapolis and Western Development. The state authorities, environmental groups, residents were all disputing each other. We have now taken the initiative to take into consideration ideas and suggestions of all parties concerned and bring about this proposal, which is a great achievement, he added.
The Waste to Energy project is scheduled to be completed in 18 months and will bring about many long term advantages.

Lin, who last won the title in 2013, defeated Son 21-17, 21-14 to reach his seventh world final.
In the gold-medal decider the Chinese star will face Denmark's Viktor Axelsen.
Lin, 33, may have reached the latter stages of his career, but he outsmarted the 29-year-old world number one from South Korea.
A run of five points in a row from 16-15 down helped seal the first game and he pressed home his advantage midway through the second.
Everyone is talking about my age, but I have proved I can still play at a high level, he said. Men's singles is very tough these days, it is a very hard route to the final. I always feel nervous before big matches, but I am very happy that I have had great support here. I watched Viktor's semi-final and he's playing very well. Tomorrow is the last match and I will be giving 1000 percent. - AFP

Markets lost ~54 points W-o-W during the start of the week to close at 4-month closing low on Thursday, but reversed its losing streak on Friday by adding ~27 points after the State Minister of Finance assured that the Government would exempt stock market trading from tax with no change to the current share transaction levy1.
The 1st draft of the Inland Revenue Bill proposed a 28% tax on trading stocks1. Average turnover levels however, declined over the week to amount to LKR 0.53Bn, 19% lower than last weeks average of LKR 0.65Bn and 39% lower than Y-T-D turnover levels of LKR 0.86Mn.
Crossings meanwhile, declined significantly during the week, amounting to 19% of total market turnover compared to the high 49% recorded last week.
Net foreign flows meanwhile declined to LKR 0.25Bn this week, ~75% lower than last weeks net flows of LKR 0.98Bn.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for signs from the Inland Revenue Bill which is expected to be passed by Parliament today.
June external sector performance improves
Sri Lankas External sector performance improved in June with the trade deficit contracting to $554Mn cf. $775Mn in June16.
The improved trade balance was largely due Export earnings increasing (+9.6% Y-o-Y) for the 4th consecutive month while expenditure on imports declined (-8.0% Y-o-Y) for the 1st time since Sept16.
Lower import expenditure was primarily due to lower imports in all major categories, especially intermediate goods which declined 12.9% Y-o-Y amid lower fuel imports (-34.1% Y-o-Y).
June performance was also aided supported by continuous inflows G-secs and equities. Nevertheless, workers remittances declined over June amid economic and geopolitical issues in the Middle East while tourist earnings remained largely flat as arrivals from the Middle East fell and Chinese tourist arrivals remained stagnant.
Reflecting in part the stronger performance over Jun17, the overall B-o-P recorded a surplus of $1,563.4Mn during H117 relative to a deficit of $1,186.1Mn in H116.
The countrys gross official reserves meanwhile rose to $7.0Bn by end June 2017(amid proceeds from the ISB and syndicated loan) and the YTD LKR depreciation (against the USD) over the period was consequently 2.0%.

McGregor awed by clinical Mayweather
LAS VEGAS AFP Aug27 Conor McGregor saluted Floyd Mayweather's clinical boxing masterclass here Saturday -- but insisted he felt he could have fought on beyond a 10th round stoppage.
The 29-year-old Irish mixed martial arts star began bravely and won the first three rounds but was ultimately outclassed by the vastly more experienced Mayweather.
Afterwards McGregor, who had never boxed professionally before Saturday's bout at the T-Mobile Arena, praised Mayweather's composed demolition job. He's composed, he's not that fast, he's not that powerful, but boy is he composed in there, McGregor said.
I thought it was close though and I thought it was a bit of an early stoppage. I was just a little fatigued. He was just a lot more composed with his shots. I have to give it to him, that's what 50 pro fights will do for you. But McGregor, a world champion in the brutal world of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, maintained that he should have been allowed to fight on past the 10th. \ I've been strangled on live TV and came back, McGregor said. When you're in here in the squared circle, everything is different. Let the man put me down, that's fatigue, that's not damage. Where was the final two rounds Let me walk back to my corner and compose myself.  - AFP

Medicinal drug cartel behind NCM submitted against me - Rajitha
Health Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said the Medicinal Drug cartel seething under the price reduction of 48 types of drugs and medical appliances was behind the allegations made against him in the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) submitted against him by the Joint Opposition.
The Minister said a systematic programme has been launched by the government to uplift the health services. The high point of this programme was the reduction in prices of 48 types of drugs and several medical appliances including stents.
The government has undertaken these health development programmes without succumbing to the pressures and influences of medical firms and tobacco companies. Such programmes to benefit innocent patients were never undertaken by the previous regime.
Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne made this observation participating in a ceremony held at Dharga Town, Beruwala on August 27 to carpet A K Mohamed Mawatha. The project is estimated to cost Rs 7.4 million.
The Minister said former parliamentarian A H M Azwer is also a heart patient. When Azwer said that he had to find Rs 1 million to purchase three stents he (Dr Senaratne) told him that the three stents would now cost him only Rs 315,000 because there had been a price reduction of stents. Azwer was amazed on hearing this good news.
Dr. Senaratne who said that drug firms were behind the baseless allegations made against him added that he would carry forward his struggle without fearing the threats posed to him. He is neither against allegations made against him because he would put forward the role he had played for the benefit of the health service which had been approved and acclaimed by the people. He said that he had launched a programme to provide 100 percent electricity and drinking water supplies to the Beruwala electorate and carpet all by-roads in the area.
Provincial Council Member Ifthikar Jameel, M.M.M. Amjad, State Pharmaceuticals Corporation Managing Director Dr. H.M.M. Rumy and Mohamed Siraz were also present on the occasion.

MTV Video Music Awards 2017: The winners list

Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards were about performances and powerful words.
Kendrick Lamar kicked off the show with a mini-medley of his songs. The fiery set included a man totally engulfed in flames. Lamar went into the evening with eight nominations, followed by Katy Perry and The Weeknd tied with five nominations each.
Perry, who also served as the night's host, started with a video sketch about space travel that featured astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Peggy Whitson. The singer joked about the state of the world.
"Even in the apocalypse we deserve the best soundtrack," she said, then introduced Paris Jackson, daughter of the late Michael Jackson, to present the award for best pop video.
Jackson made a statement before announcing the winner.
"Let's leave here tonight remembering that we must show these Nazi, white supremacist jerks in Charlottesville and all over the country that as a nation with 'liberty' as our slogan, we have zero tolerance for their violence, their hatred and their discrimination," she said. "We must resist."
The best pop video award went to Fifth Harmony for "Down."
Jackson's remarks were just part of the political tone of the night.
Rev. Robert Wright Lee IV, a 24-year-old pastor and a descendent Confederate general Robert E. Lee, appeared to speak out against racial injustice.
"We have made my ancestor an idol of white supremacy, racism and hate," Lee said. "As a pastor it is my moral duty to speak out against racism, America's original sin."
He called on "all of us with privilege and power to answer God's call to confront racism and white supremacy head-on."
Lee then introduced Susan Bro, mother of Heather Heyer, who was killed in Charlottesville while marching as a counter-protestor against a white supremacist rally seeking to stop the removal of the statue of General Robert E. Lee.
Bro spoke of missing her daughter and announced the launch of a foundation named in honor of Heyer.
"I want people to know Heather never marched alone," Bro said. "She was always joined by people from every race and every background in this country."
In that spirit, Bro said, MTV decided to honor all six of the videos nominated for the new category of best fight against the system.
Perhaps the most anticipated moment of the show arrived with the premiere of Taylor Swift's music video for her new single "Look What You Made Me Do."
The video was a much darker look for Swift, who appeared in it as different versions of herself, including as a zombie with snakes.
Swift isn't the only one to have undergone a transformation.
The iconic "Moonman" trophy handed out Sunday is now a "Moon Person."
"Why should it be a man"MTV president Chris McCarthy told the New York Times."It could be a man, it could be a woman, it could be transgender, it could be nonconformist."
That type of sentiment was shared by Pink, who accepted the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.
The singer performed a mix of some of her biggest hits, along with her new single "What About Us."
She closed her performance with a diverse group of backup dancers and held their raised hands in triumph.
During her acceptance speech, Pink told the story of her six-year-old daughter feeling unattractive because she believed she looked like a boy. The singer said she used it as a teachable moment to discuss androgynous artists who have found success, including herself.
"Baby girl we don't change, we take the gravel in the shell and we make a pearl," Pink said. "And we help other people to change so that they can see more kinds of beauty. To all the artists here, I am so inspired by all of you. Thank you for being your true selves."
The speech was one of the highlights of the night based on social media reaction, as was Jared Leto's tribute to Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington.
Bennington committed suicide in July on whatwould have been the birthday of his good friend, rocker Chris Cornell, who took his own life two months prior.
Singer Logic offered another emotional moment when Alessia Cara, Khalid and several suicide attempt survivors joined him in a performance of thesuicide prevention track "1-800-273-8255," which brought tears to the eyes of many in attendance.
Less popular with social media was Perry's hosting skills.
The "Roar" singer was soundly roasted for her skits and jokes, some of which fell flat.

Nadal, Federer warn against change despite injury toll
NEW YORK AFP Aug26, 2017Top-ranked Rafael Nadal and third-ranked Roger Federer sounded alarms against changes in tennis Saturday even as Britain's second-ranked Andy Murray joined the injured list at the US Open.
Murray withdrew with a sore left hip from the year's final Grand Slam that starts Monday on the New York hardcourts, joining 2016 winner Stan Wawrinka, Novak Djokovic, 2014 runner-up Kei Nishikori and Canada's Milos Raonic among the injured.
Don't forget we're not 21 anymore, said Nadal. Stan is 32. I am 31 and a half almost. Novak is 30. Andy is 30. We are not that young anymore, so it's normal that we had some things. That's coincidence that it happens at the same time. The superstar Spaniard also noted such past stars as Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras were not playing at such an advanced age.
Don't forget that Sampras probably at my age was not playing tennis, Borg was not playing tennis. A lot of great players were not playing tennis at our age, Nadal said. Is normal that we are still playing, we try our best, but it's normal that we have more troubles during this. Asked if the schedule needed to be trimmed to ease the workload, 19-time Grand Slam champion Federer took that idea to extremes.
You can cut down the season by half and then if there is an injury we cut it down half again, and at the end we play two months of the year eventually and we'll still be injured because now we're not playing enough, Federer said. The guys who are hurt lately, it's mostly because they are 30-plus. Wear and tear just takes its toll. Maybe some players have just had enough of playing hurt and told just themselves, 'When I come back I just want to be 100 percent.' I don't think there needs to be that much addressing, because the players they have the option not to play as much. Nadal cited different ball contracts for the US Open and its main tuneup events as a problem that could be resolved.
That's very bad for the wrist, for the elbow, for the shoulder. That's bad, Nadal said. There are contracts but there's some ways that you can fix it. - 'Playing without thinking' Nadal supported an experimental change used in qualifying to allow coaching, but drew the line at a 25-second shot clock.
Depends on what the fans want. If the fans want short points and players playing without thinking, only going for the shots, maybe is good, Nadal said.
If you want to have matches like the three finals I played here with Novak, the kind of match the crowd is more involved because the points are so long, well, you cannot expect play 50 shots' rally and in 25 seconds be ready to play the next point. I think that's not possible for a great show. But if you don't want a great show, of course it's a great improvement. Most assuredly, New York fans love nothing more than a show and Nadal can't wait to give them one when he opens play Tuesday.
Excited to start the US Open, he said. Doesn't matter if you're seeded one or 20, for me always is special to play here.  - AFP

Navy will eradicate drug smuggling: Commander Sinniah
The New Navy Commander Vice Admiral Travis Sinniah said the Navy would do its utmost to prevent narcotic drugs from entering the country through sea routes and urged the media to give the Navy one year grace period to eradicate the menace completely.
He said the Navy was billed to acquire several new vessels within the next few months to be used for patrolling the seas.
The Navy Commande called on the Malwatte and the Asgiriya Prelates in Kandy to receive their blessings after paying homage to the Sacred Tooth Relic at the Sri Dalada Maligawa on Saturday.
Vice Admiral Sinniah said the Navy would receive a new fast attack ship from India in February next year in addition to three other vessels. one would be handed over next month.
He said the Navy would create an environment necessary for Northern fishermen to engage in fishing peacefully in the Northern waters.
The Navy would adopt a different tactic to prevent poaching in the Northern seas by helping Indian fishermen to identify the international boundary line dividing India and Sri Lanka more accurately.
He said he would take measures to maintain higher discipline among officers and men.

Nearly 4,000 get solar powered electricity
Under the Sooriya Bala Sangramaya (Battle for Solar Energy) project 3,909 consumers have obtained solar power electricity connections and another 2,000 applicants would get the connections shortly, Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said.
The Sooriya Bala Sangramaya project got off the ground in September 6 last year to promote the setting up of small solar power plants on the rooftops of houses.
The Deputy Minister said solar energy connections provided under this project would total 68MW by the end of this year.
He said Net Metering, Net Accounting and Net Plus systems are in place for consumers to get registered with this project based on their preference.
He said the Government expects to add 410 MW generated by wind power and 440 MW generated by solar power to the national grid by 2020.
The Deputy Minister said a hybrid renewable energy park that would generate 1040MW from solar and wind power is proposed to be constructed in Pooneryn in the Northern Province. Within the next couple of months, we will call tenders for 170MW of wind power and 100 MW of solar power in this park. At the same time, 220KV transmission lines will be constructed to distribute power generated in the park. This will be a priority project of the Government, he said.
He noted the goal of the Government is to generate a total of 1,246 MW from renewable energy by 2020 and increase it up to 1,912 MW by 2025 and 2,476 MW by 2030.
Even among the renewable energy sources, our priority lies on solar and wind power, the Deputy Minister added.

New Inland Revenue Act to ease tax burden of poor
The Government will forward several proposals to tackle the growing gap between rich and poor ensuring social justice for all, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
It is only a certain group that became richer as assets and wealth are concentrated among a few; while the poor have become poorer during the former regime.We have to end that culture while creating an economy where everybody will benefit and ensuring equal distribution of income and wealth for all,Samaraweera told the media yesterday.
The richest 10 percent of the country receives 32 percent share of the countrys income at the moment while only one percentage share of income is received by one percent of the poorest people in the country, he said.
At least now, measures should be taken to narrow the rich-poor gap in the country. That is why the Government has proposed to introduce a new Inland Revenue Act with the objectives of simplifying and modernising our Income Tax law.We are trying to ease this tax burden on the poor while imposing a reasonable direct tax on rich and income earners. he added.
The Bill aims to reduce the indirect taxes levied from the people from 80 percent to 60 percent and increase direct taxes from 20 percent to 40 percent within the next three years, he said.
With the reforming of the system, we will be able to create a strong foundation for the future while enabling to bring economic instability down, he added.

Pathetic Sri Lanka slump to another defeat - lose series
PALLEKELE, Sunday: Sri Lanka stumbled towards another series defeat as they lost the third one-day international to India by six wickets but not before unprecedented scenes of angry spectators venting their displeasure at the loss by pelting plastic bottles onto the playing area and holding up play for 32 minutes.
The incident the first of its kind in Sri Lankas cricket history started at the commencement of the 45th over with India on 210-4 - eight runs away from victory.
The players and umpires returned to the pavilion and came back after the ground was cleared of the debris. Play resumed after a section of the unruly crowd was vacated from the ground by the riot police.
India took another seven balls to knock off the required runs in 45.1 overs making 218-4 to give them an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series. India rode on opener Rohit Sharmas 11th ODI hundred to chase down a moderate target of 218 with 29 balls to spare.
On a fresh pitch that offered enough sideways movement Sri Lanka chose to bat first and struggled to reach 217-9 off their 50 overs which was totally insufficient to contain a strong Indian batting line up unless someone like Akila Dananjaya could produce a magical spell like he did on Thursday.
Dananjaya briefly gave glimpses of doing so when he took two wickets in his first two overs sending back Lokesh Rahul and Kedhar Jadav to reduce India to 61-4, but like in the second ODI Sri Lankas success came to a grinding halt against an Indian road block.
In the second ODI it was MS Dhoni who thwarted Sri Lankas attempt to win with Bhuvneshwar Kumar. On this occasion it was Dhoni again who proved to be the stumbling block - in partnership with Sharma who carried India to yet another win.
The Sharma-Dhoni partnership prospered to add an unbroken 157 for the fifth wicket off 180 balls.
Sharma was the mainstay of the Indian run chase coolly and calmly collecting his runs to bring up his third hundred against Sri Lanka off 118 balls with 14 fours and a six. He was put down at 113 by skipper Chamara Kapugedera at mid on but that chance came too late for Sri Lanka to come back into the game as India was only 34 runs shy of victory. Dhoni finished on 67 not out off 86 balls (4 fours, 1 six)  his 67th ODI fifty and 17th against Sri Lanka.
Lasith Malinga wicketless in the first two ODIs picked up his first wicket of the series and the 299th of his career when bowled Shikhar Dhawan for five. But that was to be his solitary success of the match.
Indian bowlers were well disciplined and bowled to their field making run making a difficult task for Sri Lanka. In the circumstances Lahiru Thirimanne and Dinesh Chandimal, Sri Lankas two comeback men stitched together the best partnership of the innings 72 off 104 balls for the third after Bumrah had made the early breakthrough by sending back Dickwella (13) and Mendis (1) within the space of four overs of each other.
Thirimanne returning to the team after a 19-month absence played resolutely for 80 off 105 balls (5 fours, 1 six)  his 17th ODI fifty and fifth against India before his innings came to an untimely end when he fell to Bumrahs slow ball and chipped a catch to midwicket.
Chandimal who opened the innings with Dickwella was going well until a sharp rising delivery from Pandya hit him on the right thumb. Although he continued to bat after treatment on the field he somewhat batted with difficulty and eventually fell to Pandya holing out to deep square leg.
It was later revealed that Chandimal had suffered a hairline fracture in his right thumb and he did not take the field when India began their run chase. Apart from the Chandimal-Thirimanne partnership the rest of the batting put up a woeful performance once again.
Here we have a Sri Lanka team struggling to put up 200 on the board in 50 overs when other teams are looking to running up at the same total in T20 cricket. It is to such depths that the countrys cricket has nose-dived.
Where the Lankan batsmen are erring is their inability to rotate the strike. Limited overs cricket is not all about hitting boundaries but lessening the number of dot balls so that you run up a decent total to allow the bowlers a chance to bowl at the opposition.
Yesterday the Lankan batsmen played down an incredible 184 dot balls and ran only 93 singles in the 308 balls they faced during their innings. What this implies is that Sri Lanka lacks batsmen of quality to pick the gaps and rotate the strike when the bowlers are on song.
The only thing that Sri Lanka did right was under a new captain Chamara Kapugedera they ended their losing sequence with the toss and won it for the first time in the series.
But the decision they took to bat first seemed to back fire as the wicket provided lateral movement for the fast bowlers and Bumrah making full use of it took his first five-for in ODIs ending with the impressive figures of 10-2-27-5. He won the Man of the Match award. Bumrah whose mentor is Lasith Malinga troubled all the batsmen with his deceptive pace, change of lengths and angles and deserved his five wickets. His new ball partner Buvneshwar Kumar was unlucky again to finish wicketless. He is still looking for his first in the series.
The fourth ODI will take place at the R Premadasa Stadium on August 31.

The perfect time of day to nap revealed
Power napping is undoubtedly a skill. Not all of us are able to drop off for 30 minutes in the middle of the day, even when were exhausted. But those of us who can nap reap considerable benefits to their health, productivity and brain power.
And it turns out theres actually a perfect time of day to grab some quick shut-eye: 3pm.
The reason for this comes down to our circadian rhythm, which dips around 3pm. Many people also experience post-lunch sleepiness or a lack of alertness, making it the perfect time to nap.
You should aim to nap for 20 to 30 minutes - any longer and you risk falling into a deep sleep which could actually leave you feeling groggy for an hour after waking up. This is known as sleep inertia.
And although a nap can be particularly valuable if you didnt get enough sleep the night before, napping for too long could make it harder to sleep that night.
According to the latest report by the Sleep Council, almost three-quarters of Brits get less than seven hours sleep a night.
Whats more, the number of people who get less than five hours a night has grown from seven per cent to 12 per cent.
When youre sleep deprived, only bad things happen to your mood, concentration, health, and immune system, Rajkumar Dasgupta, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, explained to Tonic.
Its not good to be sleep deprived.
But with more and more of us not getting enough sleep at night, naps could take on increasing value.
Studies have proven that napping provides significant health benefits and can actually counter the effects of sleep deprivation.
After napping, people are more alert, creative, have better memory skills and are better at learning. Youre also less likely to make mistakes and have accidents.
And lets not forget that people often wake up from a nap feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.
But if you dont work at a company like Google or Uber (who encourage napping), you may have to convince your boss before you curl up under your desk.

Police arrest second man after Buckingham Palace sword attack
UK: Three unarmed cops were injured as they incapacitated the 26-year-old attacker, who was repeatedly yelling "Allahu Akbar", with CS spray outside the royal residence on The Mall on Friday night.
The suspect, from Luton, has been arrested under the terrorism act following the rampage at the palace - and cops have been given more time to question him.
Police arrested a second man - a 30-year-old - after raiding an address in West London this morning. The suspect was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism and is currently in custody.
Police have said the 26-year-old attacker in a blue Toyota Prius "reached for a 4ft sword" in front of terrified tourists as three heroic unarmed cops rushed to tackle him.
At least six ambulances and police cars were seen rushing towards the London landmark as dozens of uniformed police pushed back tourists just after 8.30pm.Two of the officers were taken by ambulance to hospital with minor cuts and discharged a short time later.
The third officer did not require hospital treatment.Police blocked off all entrances to the palace, which was not occupied by The Queen, who is in Scotland, last night.
Witness Emma Bell, 28, said of the terrorist: There was blood all over his face and his shirt.
I dont know if the blood was his or from the police. I was scared.
"We didnt know if there were other terrorists. An officer said calmly, You need to get out of here.Commander Dean Haydon, the head of the Mets Counter Terrorism Command, said: I would like to pay tribute to the bravery and professionalism of these officers who quickly brought this incident under control.
"Their vigilance, courage and the swiftness of their response demonstrates how our officers are protecting the public at this time.
Officers from the Counter Terrorism Command are now investigating and searches are being carried out in the Luton area today.
We believe the man was acting alone and we are not looking for other suspects at this stage."While we cannot speculate on what the man was intending to do - this will be determined during the course of the investigation - it is only right that we investigate this as a terrorist incident at this time.
The maniac is said to have been seen driving erratically before coming to a halt near a police car and lunging at officers with the blade.An onlooker said: "He hit a bollard and got out with a machete."
Pictures on social media showed a police cordon surrounding the top of The Mall in central London with forensic teams working next to the Queen Victoria Memorial.A witness said: The officers wrestled a man from a car who looked like he was driving his vehicle towards them.
The scuffle took place and he was dragged out the car brandishing a knife, which cut the police tying to detain him. - THE SUN

## Title: PURIFY AND TRANSFORM RELIGIONS
## Supertitle:

PURIFY AND TRANSFORM RELIGIONS
Precious insights about the human condition, the meaning of human life, how life is to be lived, and towards what end life should tend have come to us through philosophers, thinkers and the founding leaders of religions. What doth it profit a man to gain the whole world and ruin his life (Gospel of St. Mark, Ch.8 v. 36). Founders of religions, philosophers and great thinkers have endeavoured to lay down principles and values that could be and should be applied to life and influence human behaviour.
Succeeding those leaders, their immediate followers who grasped their teaching and understood them well and followed their ways have transmitted that teaching to succeeding generations. Thus they have raised the minds of human beings beyond the visible, material and the tangible to the intangible, the invisible and the transcendent. Due to their closeness to their teacher, the disciples insight and experience of the unseen and the invisible were to them as real as the visible.
They even came to an experience of them in their life as a foretaste and a pledge of what is to come. They have freely communicated their life-experiences to us and it is up to us to examine, investigate and understand them and if they seem agreeable and true, follow them.
BACK TO THE ROOTS
We find ourselves endowed with not only physical capacities but also intellectual, spiritual and moral capacities. We have not exhausted finding the depths in them. The human being not only learns to scale physical heights and overcome physical limitations, the human being also has the capacity to reach spiritual heights not only individually but also as a community, as a national and global family. The modern age provides many challenges in all these spheres and areas of human endeavour.
Thinkers have even attempted to go to the roots and beginnings of religions to investigate the values that had been handed down by religious leaders.
Though we have inherited valuable insights from the wisdom of the ancients, we ourselves are endowed and have the ability to look at, observe and decipher the vast visible world and the observable universe in our own way. We try to understand the meaning and end of all that exists. We keep striving to understand and test various long established principles and values, compare and analyze them and arrive at principles of life, values and truths we begin to firmly hold.
Especially today, with the advancement of knowledge on all frontiers, the modern human beings are also delving into the teachings of the ancient religions to search for and find if there be in them meanings and values that could underpin, consolidate and direct individual and community lives of people in the modern epochs twenty-first century even though human beings have lived on earth for hundreds of centuries.
REACQUIRING OLD WISDOM
To some people, today, who are extremely confident of their ability which they think they superabundantly possess, the insights of the ancients are absolutely worthless because today we are the most intelligent, the most sophisticated and advanced people to ever inhabit this planet earth.
Others wiser than the former are humbler and more realistic are readier to learn from the heritage of those who have gone before us. Just as they have inherited an old house which they suitably repair and refurbish to make it a habitable dwelling, they gratefully inherit also the wisdom of the old transmitted to them by their forefathers; they do not put them away, they gladly accept them and adopt them and even refine and sharpen them as values to live by.
In our journey to the modern world we may have not only thrown away unique values of life, many have got closely involved in their religions and lost themselves in a confusing maze of callous assumptions and preferences alien to the religions fundamental beliefs and principles. Human hearts until they are formed by disciplined practice often turn to things that are wrong and evil.
Many distinct religions and communities of belief have not done for centuries a sober self-assessment and a self-criticism of their manner of living according to their respective foundational beliefs. Many have not come to a comprehensive understanding of the values they have opted to believe in and live by.
Many are hesitant to admit that among themselves a ghetto mentality has predominated and due to a peculiar way of treatment extended to others, relationships with other human beings and communities have got distorted. Elite religious communities themselves that should have remained refined and unpolluted have got tainted and corrupted. In such a state relationships with others are difficult and even if they are established, they remain unstable. Many are reluctant to say mea culpa (my fault) for not having promoted the good of every man and the whole man without discrimination.
Unless we constantly review and purify our outlook and understanding of human affairs, they tend to degenerate and get corrupted. Human beings have corrupted and could still corrupt themselves, religious beliefs as well as religious precincts and environments.
HUMAN BEINGS MADE NEW
If misunderstandings that could give rise to antagonism, violent conflict and warring among religions are undesirable, how are we going to avoid such possible situations Could we have the foresight and establish acceptable, honest and frank relationships among ourselves
Could we not severally and collectively search and come to a fresh and broad understanding of a vision of human destiny, the meaning and purpose of human life, the value of human life, the growth and development of humanness and the legitimate hopes and aspirations of human beings Are not human beings prior to the things, places and edifices they use and the powers they exercise Do we accept that avoidance of facing these challenges could lead us all to be insensitive and heartless, that is inhuman, sub-human and immoral
We need to come to a newer and deeper understanding of our religions and religious beliefs. Neither religions nor the followers of religions should cause hurt and destruction to the lives and possessions of others. All human beings have human dignity and human rights which should be always respected. Human beings are endowed with intelligence and rationality. All human beings are capable of cooperation, collaboration and sharing. With motivations provided and inspired by religions, all human beings could be made new and saved from the humanly demeaning cravings arising from selfishness, egoism, self-absorption and the ghetto mentality. None of us are perfect. Therefore we need to get rid of our imperfections; we all need constant purification. Religions should be helpful in that if religions too undergo regular purification.
RELIGIOUS FANATICISM
The extent that religion and religious beliefs could be depraved and perverted is well demonstrated by the phenomenon of the ISIS attempts of restoration of the caliphate calling all Muslims to unite and rally round Abu Bakr Baghdadi of the extremist group of Sunni Muslims who emanated after the ideologue Osama Bin Laden, in the 1990s.
Though the great majority of Muslims do not see any legitimacy in Baghdadi and refuse to recognize him or support his terrorist activities, this shows that unacceptable emphasis of religious texts and corruption of religious norms could lead to and cause bloodshed not only among non Muslims but also among Muslims themselves.
Religious fanatics obsessed with a peculiar stance on religion and the rights of their followers do not regard human dignity and rights of other people and cannot tolerate them. ISIS fellows who succeed in attracting and indoctrinating fanatical ideologies and terrorist attitudes to some raw young people brought up in communities with confused values, have destroyed many young lives and manipulated them to commit many unspeakable crimes in the name of a religion they have hardly understood. Far too late many young people have later regretted joining IIIS and committing unspeakable crimes.
Such revolting attitudes should never corrupt any religion in Sri Lanka. However that does not absolve religious leaders from being vigilant and imparting wholesome religious training and formation to the young so that any form of religious fanaticism may be prevented.
Religions need purification and transformation under the guidance of prudent and wise religious leaders if they wish to bequeath to the coming generations the riches of religious truth, good traditions and the noble religious way of life.

## Title: QUESTIONABLE SAFETY OF GLYPHOSATE
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Monday, August 28, 2017 - 01:00
QUESTIONABLE SAFETY OF GLYPHOSATE
The declared safety of glyphosate formulations, particularly Roundup, is based on false claims made by Monsanto, the manufacturer  and parroted by the regulatory bodies of the USA, Canada and the European Union as well by users and scientists. These lies were exposed two years ago. I shall deal with that later in this article. Other claims for safety of glyphosate are based on 30-year old standards and testing methods.
It is being examined as to whether the current regulatory processes are adequate to assess the safety or danger of chemicals licensed since the end of World War II.
One obvious shortcoming is that the current approval process limits laboratory animal feed/test trials to 90 days only. This is entirely too short a period because chronic diseases do not show up in 3 months  not even 3 years, but more likely in 30 years in humans or by midlife in lab rats.
Another serious shortcoming concerns the emerging science of epigenetics by which it can be shown that the endocrine system is disrupted by chemical residues as low as a few parts per billion. This negates the use of an approval process based on maximum residue levels [MRLs]. The futility of these processes is shown by the simple fact that the MRL for glyphosate in drinking water in the EU is 0.1 ppb while that in the USA is 7000 times that at 700 ppb. Can consumers trust science and regulators in this kind of scenario
New research carried out from just about five years back and after the exposure of Monsanto, show an entirely different picture of glyphosate. Even so, still there are only a few long-term studies and still fewer tests on glyphosate formulations. The latter can lead to a dead end.
The focus should be on glyphosate formulations [GFs]. They are proved to be more than twice as toxic as glyphosate that makes up only about 41% of the GF. Only the manufacturers know what these additives are because they are claimed to be trade secrets and inert. They are far from inert. Manufacturers have not tested their toxicity; no one else can test their toxicity either, because they are not identified. One additive, POEA has been proved positively toxic. So the safety of GFs is highly questionable on that score alone.
(Professor) Mathews article The Safety of Glyphosate [CDN August 1, 2017] is misinformed and misleading. He appears to have a similarly inadequately informed supporting scientist in Dr. L.M.K.Thillekeratna, a former Director of the RRI. [CDN August 7, Letters to Editor]. I thought it best that the points raised by Mathew should be taken up separately.
1. Convenience of Glyphosate
Professor Mathew, though a scientist, is promoting convenience of use above human safety. What is he first A scientist or a profit-oriented commercial farmer Is he not a humanist either
The convenience of glyphosate is admitted but it is backfiring because of health hazards being made known through Monsantos own covered up research of over 40 years and new research.
1. It is killing people and the environment.
2. It has created superweeds that cannot be killed by glyphosate even at high concentrations.
In the USA alone, 70 million acres were virtually idle in 2013 due to superweeds produced by use of GFs at least twice a year. Superweeds came out just a decade after the introduction of GFs. The idle acreage is increasing yearly. This is a 100 per cent increase from the idle land extent for the same reason in 2009. There are over 20 species of superweeds. Some are seven feet tall. One is a species of Amaranth, with millions of seeds per plant. We have a relative of it in Katu Keera. It is already a tough plant that has seeds in their thousands. That will be one of our superweeds.
Tests conducted by the University of Illinois Plant Clinic in 2016 showed that weed resistance to GFs and PPO inhibitor herbicides have reached epic proportions. Out of 2000 samples from 593 sites in 10 states, 76.8% of the sites showed resistance to glyphosate herbicides, 62.5% of the sites showed resistance to PPO inhibitor herbicides and 49% of the sites showed resistance to both types of herbicides. PPO inhibitors are herbicides which kill weeds by destroying cell membranes  a very much stronger poison than glyphosate.
Farmers who can afford to do so are employing bulldozers and digging out the entire land; others are using ploughs towed by tractors; others have abandoned the land and farming because they do not have the money to dig out the superweeds. These farms are in hundreds of acres. All are aware that this digging out will have to be done every year because the weeds broadcast millions of seeds  and these were lands that were farmed under no-till agriculture to prevent erosion!
What is the response from Monsanto Blaming the farmer for monocrops and continuous use of a single herbicide. Monsanto ignores the fact that farmers followed Monsantos advice. The new advice is to use herbicides that have combinations of 2-4D, Dicamba and glufosinate from Monsanto and other manufacturers.
That means further poisoning  on a much more lethal scale, for humans and all living beings. It is also a losing battle. As Charles Darwin said, nature adapts; yes, but for the better or worse, here.
Superweeds will become a problem without a solution under the present methods of convenient agriculture promoted by the biotech industry and its supporters. Crop rotation, the use of different herbicides, adoption of other weed control measures, growth of ground cover, mulching etc. must be applied. Agriculture is not a business only. It is not for arm-chair farmers, visiting land-owners and single-minded seekers of profit. Agriculture is life  more so than medical services.
2. Toxicology of glyphosate
Professor Mathew states that All Chemicals are toxic. So there is a range for toxicity and LD 50 is used as the standard.
On his argument that all chemicals are toxic, we might just as well call for the removal of the bans and cautionary advices on DDT, Thalidomide, Polychlorinated biphenyls, Bisphenol A, Lasso, Aspartame, Paxil and even tobacco smoking etc. For instance, DDT helped eliminate Malaria; so lets get it back to kill the dengue mosquito, and the malaria mosquito still found in Moneragala.
As for the LD50 standard, it was developed in 1927 to estimate the relative poisoning potency of a chemical given at once. Because of its inadequacy, several other tests such as LD01, LD100, LDLO and TDLO have been developed.
All these tests are more suitable for establishing acute toxicity; that is defined as the ability of a chemical to cause ill effects relatively soon after one oral administration or a 4-hour exposure to a chemical in air. Relatively soon is usually defined as a period of minutes, hours (up to 24) or days (up to about 2 weeks) but rarely longer.
As such, to an informed person, these tests are very obviously useless to test the toxicity of glyphosate. It is said that one can drink two pints of glyphosate without fear of a quick death. It is not acutely toxic. It is a Grade 3 poison in a descending scale of 4.

Root leads England rally against Windies
Leeds: England captain Joe Root threatened to make the West Indies pay for giving him another reprieve in the second Test at Headingley after opposing skipper Jason Holder starred with both bat and ball.
England were 171 for three in their second innings at stumps on Sundays third day, a lead of two runs, after the West Indies had made an impressive 427 in their first innings.
Root, dropped on 10, was 45 not out on his Yorkshire home ground, with Dawid Malan unbeaten on 21.
Their unbroken stand was so far worth 77 runs.
Pace-bowling all-rounder Holder who had earlier made a valuable 43, captured the key wicket of Alastair Cook and removed Tom Westley on his way to stumps figures of two for 44 in 17 overs.
England, facing a large first-innings deficit of 169 runs, saw Cook and Mark Stoneman, who along with fellow batsman Westley and Malan is looking to cement his Test place ahead of the upcoming Ashes tour of Australia, start steadily.
Stoneman, Cooks 12th opening partner in five years since the retirement of Andrew Strauss, did, however, hit three fours off as many balls from Kemar Roach.
But the more defensive Cook, Englands all-time leading Test run-scorer, fell for 23 to end a stand of 58 as Holder, maintaining an excellent line and length, eventually found the left-handers outside edge and had him caught behind. Number three Westley should have been run out for six after a mix-up with Stoneman.
He failed to cash in though, falling for eight when caught behind driving loosely at Holder.
But Stoneman, hit on the left hand by Holder on 35, completed a maiden Test fifty in his third innings at this level.
The 30-year-old Surrey left-hander was bowled soon afterwards, however, for 52 by an excellent delivery Shannon Gabriel that pitched in line and hit off stump. The fast bowler had an anxious wait as the umpires checked for a no-ball before it was confirmed that England were 94 for three.
Malan had a lucky break on four when the West Indies opted against reviewing a rejected caught behind appeal off Gabriel, although technology indicated a thin edge.
While the West Indies batting and bowling has improved markedly this match, their fielding remains fallible.
For the second time in the match they dropped Root early in his innings when he fended at the luckless Roach only for Kyle Hope to floor the gully chance.
Root, dropped on eight en route to 59 in Englands first innings 258, drove Holder for four and struck Roach through the covers for another boundary. AFP

Sandya Ekanyake rape, murder : A tragedy most heinous
The date was the August 23; time, around 12 in the afternoon. The sun had decided to bid farewell to the eastern sky and move towards the west. But she did not know that she was living the last few hours of her life. She had passed her O/L exams and had embarked on studying for her A/L exams with all the hopes of entering university, but her dreams were dashed while still being made. This is the story of the tragic death of 17-year-old student; Ekanayaka Mudiyanselage Sandya Madushani Ekanyake, a resident of Giribawa East, No. 2, Sudarmarama Mawatha, Saliya Ashokapura.
Having studied her books for many hours, she had decided to take a small break in front of the television. Perhaps the sound of the television muffled the entrance of the man into the house. He was the harbinger of death, but she had little time to think of that, let alone save her own life. Perhaps she greeted him with a smile. But the degenerate thought little of all this as he committed this barbaric act and squashed all hope of life from her. She fell victim to his deviant behaviour in her own bedroom. She may have tried to call out the names of her mother, father and brother, but the man had stuffed a piece of cloth into her mouth, making it difficult for her to call out for help.
When the Police found her body, there were various scratch marks all over her. Her upper lip contained bite marks of the man who had viciously raped her. Her life had ended all too soon. As she lived 17 years of her life, carefree and happy, she did not know that she was being watched lustfully. Death came to her as this man fulfilled his barbaric sexual desires.
Police reports indicate that Sandya was alone at home when the incident took place. Her father was tending to his paddy field. Her brother had left for work to another city. Her mother, R. M. Seelawathi, was selling savouries at a place close to home. But perhaps her mother felt that something was wrong and thus, she had returned home early that day. It was too late by then and her daughter was deadraped and killed. As she saw her daughter spread out on the bed, lifeless, she began to scream, but Sandya would not wake to her pleas. A few neighbours came rushing to her aid and soon called the Police emergency hotline for assistance.
Suspect Apprehended
Giribawa Police OIC Inspector K. V. P. C. Deepal and officers who sprang into immediate action called into assistance officers of the Meegalewa and Galgamuwa Police stations and rushed to the girls house. But all efforts made to resuscitate Sandya failed. Investigations into the crime thus began right away. As news of the crime spread around the village of Saloya Ashokapura, terror and sadness engulfed the hearts of the villages and they all flocked to Sandyas house. They all lamented at her loss; she was the brightest student in her school.
Perhaps God was looking down on this tragedy at the time. For as word spread, the alleged rapist tried to flee the village by bus, but his suspicious manner was noticed first by the bus conductor. He immediately took to inform an individual at the Giribawa-Paluwewa junction three-wheeler park of this man.
The youth at the stand then acted fast and as the bus reached the Paluwewa junction, they stopped it and apprehended the suspect. Though Sandyas life had been brought to an abrupt end, the perpetrator is yet to live his life. The three-wheeler drivers handed the suspect over to the Police. The Police thus far have identified him to be a 31-year-old bachelor.
Thereafter, initial investigations into the incident were carried out step by step. Officers began work from Kadimudiya. A yellow police tape was drawn around Sandyas house and garden. All windows and doors of the house were shut. Everyone was prohibited from entering the house and Police security in the area was tightened. By this time, many had gathered around her house, impatient to know what had really happened. And as the mother broke down weeping in the lawn, her neighbours started discussing snippets of what they knew of the suspect. They said that the man was a drug addict and that after the incident took place, both his parents had fled the area. The residents, however, had broken into his home and even set fire to one of the rooms there.
The Police, in the meantime, said they found around 300 clips of pornographic material in the mobile phone of the suspect.
The Giribawa Police had taken the man into custody, but Police are yet to confirm his guilt. They had called to their assistance officers of the Nikaweratiya Crime branch.
Thereafter, magisterial inquiries into the case were carried out by Galgamuwa acting magistrate Himal Chandana Kahadawala. Sandyas body had been sent to the Anuradha Teaching Hospital for post mortem investigations to be carried out under the Hospitals specialist Judicial Medical Officer. Police officers have also made arrangements to send the suspect before the Galgamuwa Judicial Medical Officer to obtain a medical report from him.
As investigations progress, the Police presented the suspect before the Galgamuwa Magistrates Court on August 24. They had pressed charges of rape and murder against the suspect. Galgamuwa Magistrate L.T. Warushawithana ordered that the suspect be remanded until September 4.
Nikaweratiya Police Superintendent Sanjeewa Bandara had been in constant contact with Police officers, along with Galgamuwa Police Assistant Superintendent Anura Delgahapitiya who was coordinating all efforts from the scene of the crime. The OICs of Galgamuwa and Meegalewa too have extended their cooporation towards Giribawa OIC K. V. P. C. Deepal and his officers.
As the sun set on Sandyas house, her light which shone through her home is no more. The sister who would wait near the door for her brother to return home will no longer be there to greet him. Her books too will no longer feel her touch as they gather dust in her room. As her friends mourn her loss, Sandya will not hear their cries and she bids farewell to this world.
We hope that our justice system serves her well and executes punishment on her perpetrator, so that we will no more have to write about the tragedy of girls like Sandya.

Second storm hits Hong Kong and Macau in week
HONG KONG: A powerful storm lashed Hong Kong and Macau on Sunday, just days after a punishing typhoon swept through southern China and claimed at least 18 lives.
Both cities raised a Typhoon 8 signal -- the third-highest warning level -- early Sunday morning as severe tropical storm Pakhar made landfall in the region, where emergency workers were still battling to repair Wednesdays damage.
Around 300 flights were cancelled or delayed Sunday, a spokesperson from Hong Kongs Airport Authority said. Cathay Pacific, the citys flagship carrier, said cancellations and significant delays were expected to continue into Monday.
All ferry services in Hong Kong were suspended. Dozens of trees weakened by Wednesdays typhoon were brought down in the latest storm. Pakhar brought winds of up to 130 kilometres (80 miles) per hour to Hong Kong. The Typhoon 8 storm warning level would typically shut down Hong Kongs stock market, schools and businesses. In Macau, authorities issue fresh flooding alerts as shops that were battered Wednesday remained closed on Sunday morning, and traffic lights stayed blacked out after Hato wiped out power in the city.
This is tough, but there is nothing we can do, said Leung Chin-pang, the owner of a maintenance shop, who has been left without water supply since the first storm hit.
Pakhar -- named after a freshwater fish in the lower Mekong river -- smashed into southern China as worst-hit Macau was still picking up the pieces after Typhoon Hato, the citys strongest typhoon in 53 years according to the city government.
Hato, which triggered the most severe Typhoon 10 warning, had ripped through the gambling hub Wednesday, plunging casinos into darkness and causing destructive floods.
The official death toll in Macau reached 10, as the enclaves government faces recriminations over its lack of preparation.
Dozens of visitors had returned to the main tourist attraction of Senado Square in Macau Sunday. Streets appeared cleaner after local residents of all ages and around 1,000 troops from the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) Macau garrison worked to clear piles of debris blocking the streets.
Four Hong Kong journalists covering the impact of the typhoon were barred entry into Macau Saturday on the ground that they threatened the stability of internal security, according to the Hong Kong Journalists Association.
The group expressed deep regret over the incident and urged Macaus authorities to respect press freedom in a statement Saturday.
A further eight people are known to have died from Typhoon Hato in the Chinese province of Guangdong, which Pakhar also reached mid-morning Sunday.
Summer is typhoon season for the region including Hong Kong, which can experience storms of such severity that the entire city shuts down. Both Hong Kong and Macau are expected to lower the typhoon warning signal to the second lowest level in the early afternoon of Sunday, the cities weather forecast agencies said. - AFP

September 1 to go down in insurance history
In 2015, the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) began a journey to gain national recognition to increase the spread of awareness about the value of Insurance. With the support of the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL), the Marketing and Sales Forum (MSF) and the IASL, sought the governments approval to declare September 1 as National Insurance Day.
Over the past two years, the IASL has recognized and celebrated the month of September as, Insurance Awareness Month. Activation programmes, media promotions, competitions, etc., are organized and launched throughout the entire month in order to ensure the spread of life and general insurance awareness throughout the island.
However, this year will see the entire industry celebrate a day officially dedicated to Insurance in Sri Lanka.
September 1, 2017, will see leading members of the Insurance industry gather at the Independence Arcade in Colombo 07 for the official declaration ceremony of Sri Lankas first National Insurance Day.
Presiding over the days events as chief guest will be the IBSL Chairperson Indrani Sugathadasa. Other dignitaries present will include Postmaster General D.L.P Rohana Abeyratne, IBSL Director General Damayanthi Fernando, IASL President Deepthi Lokuarachchi and the CEOs and MDs of Insurance companies in Sri Lanka.
In honour of the occasion, a commemorative stamp will be launched on September 1 at the ceremony at the Independence Arcade. Prior to the event, the stamp will be officially presented to President Maithripala Sirisena on August 31.
The IASL and the MSF have organized an extensive and widespread awareness campaign throughout September, including competitions, sales promotions, media campaigns, activations and numerous other programmes.
Given the very low level of penetration in Sri Lanka, the achievement of our goal to have September 1 declared National Insurance Day is a tremendous achievement. It is a historic event that will be forever remembered among the Insurance community of Sri Lanka as well as the general public, thus, serving as a means of increasing the influence of the industry and the spread of Insurance awareness throughout Sri Lanka, said MSF Chairman Hashra Weerawardena.
The primary responsibility of the Insurance advisor is to help people get back on their feet following some form of calamity and loss. However, this task has often proved difficult over the recent years due to the lack of awareness about the value of general and life insurance among the public. It is our fervent hope that by naming a day in honour of Insurance and spreading our message of awareness throughout the island, we may see a drastic improvement in the industry, said IASL President Lokuarachchi.

SLs export earnings up 9.6%
Sri Lankas external sector showed signs of revival with a significantly improved trade balance and continuous inflows to the government securities market in June 2017.
A substantial growth in industrial and agricultural exports and a decline in importation of consumer and intermediate goods resulted in a notable improvement in the trade balance in June 2017.
Inflows to the financial account were characterised by steady inflows to the government securities market while foreign investment in the Colombo Stock Exchange(CSE) also remained positive during the month.
Export earnings in June 2017 expanded for the fourth consecutive month to US dollars 987 million, registering a 9.6 per cent year-on-year growth.
The largest contribution to this growth was from industrial exports (77.1 per cent) followed by agricultural exports (20.6 per cent).
Earnings from industrial exports grew by 9.8 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 750 million in June 2017, led by higher exports of transport equipment.
Earnings from transport equipment increased by nearly sevenfold to US dollars 54 million compared to the corresponding month in 2016, owing to the export of two ships to Singapore.
In addition, high export earnings from food and beverages, rubber products and petroleum products also contributed significantly to the growth in industrial exports.
Export earnings from food and beverages increased by more than twofold in June 2017. Exports of rubber products increased by 15.4 per cent (year-on-year) due to growth in all sub categories.
Reflecting higher export volumes and prices of bunker and aviation fuel, earnings from exports of petroleum products increased by 26.7 per cent (year-on-year) in June 2017.
However, export earnings from textiles and garments, which account for around 40 per cent of total exports, declined by 7.5 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 398 million in June 2017 reflecting a decline in garment exports to the USA and EU markets.
Earnings from agricultural exports at US dollars 232 million increased by 8.3 per cent (year-on-year) in June 2017 reflecting higher exports of all major categories of agricultural products except coconut and spices.
Export earnings from tea increased by 13.7 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 139 million owing to higher prices despite the decline in volume by 9.5 per cent.
In line with high tea prices prevailing in the international market, the average export price of Ceylon tea increased to US dollars 5.36 per kg in June 2017 from US dollars 4.27 per kg in June 2016. Earnings from minor agricultural products also increased by 30.8 per cent during the month.
Earnings from seafood exports continued its growth in June 2017 benefitting from the removal of the ban on exports of fisheries products to the EU market. As a result, seafood exports increased by 17.4 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 15 million in June 2017, registering a 101.2 per cent growth in exports to the EU market.
On a cumulative basis, earnings from exports grew by 5.2 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 5,398 million during the first half of 2017, as a result of high income received from exports of tea, transport equipment, petroleum products and machinery and mechanical appliances. The leading markets for merchandise exports of Sri Lanka during the first half of 2017 were the USA, the UK, India, Germany and Italy accounting for about 50 per cent of total exports.
Expenditure on imports in June 2017 declined for the first time since September 2016 to US dollars 1,541 million registering a year-on-year decline of 8.0 per cent. This reflected lower imports of all major categories, particularly intermediate goods imports. Expenditure on import of intermediate goods declined by 12.9 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 792 million in June 2017, largely due to the lower expenditure on fuel imports.
Expenditure on fuel imports declined by 34.1 per cent (year-on-year) in June 2017 reflecting lower import volumes and average import prices of crude oil and refined petroleum products.
Lower import expenditure on base metals such as iron and steel as well as rubber and articles, specially rubber in primary forms, also contributed significantly to the decline in intermediate goods imports.
Import expenditure of textiles and textile articles showed a modest growth of 1.7 per cent (year-on-year) in June 2017.
Expenditure on consumer goods imports declined by 8.9 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 323 million in June 2017, mainly driven by lower importation of non-food consumer goods such as medical and pharmaceuticals, clothing and accessories, personal vehicles and telecommunication devices.
The increasing trend in rice imports observed since January 2017 continued in June 2017 as well. Expenditure on rice imports increased by more than eight-fold due to an increase in import volume to 16 million kg in June 2017 in comparison to 2 million kg in June 2016.
Further, import expenditure on sugar increased by 3.4 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 26 million, mainly due to higher import prices.
Import expenditure on investment goods declined marginally by 1.2 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 405 million during June 2017 led by lower imports of building materials and machinery and equipment.
Import expenditure on transport equipment increased by 19.1 per cent (year-on-year) in June 2017 mainly due to higher imports of road vehicles such as vans, tankers and bowsers.
However, import expenditure on machinery and equipment, personal vehicles and textiles and textile articles declined during the first half of 2017.
India, China, the UAE, Singapore and Japan continued to be the main import origins during the first half of 2017, accounting for about 59 per cent of total imports.

SLASSCOM and ICT Norway in joint effort  to boost Sri Lankas IT sector
In an effort aimed at helping Sri Lankas IT/BPM industry reach the USD 5 billion mark by 2022, the countrys primary IT/BPO chamber, the Sri Lanka Association of Software and Service Companies (SLASSCOM) together with ICT Norway (IKT-Norge) kicked off a fresh initiative to empower startups in the country.
SLASSCOM and ICT Norway have come together to offer Sri Lankan startups the unique opportunity to take part in the Oslo Innovation Week, which is scheduled for September this year. The event has gained recognition as the most interactive innovation conference in the world.
Startups across Sri Lanka will be given an opportunity at a pitching event organised by both the Sri Lankan and the Norwegian bodies on August 30, 2017. The startups with the most unique and innovative pitches will be shortlisted and the top three winning companies will be sponsored by ICT Norway to take part in the five-day Oslo Innovation Week in Norway from September 25 to 29, 2017.
8 local startups viz. ShoutOUT Labs, PopuloPvt Ltd, Right Posture, Generation Epsilon (Pvt) Ltd, Veta (Pvt) Ltd, BotFactory, Nurone Labs and ConscientAI are set to take part in the pitching event which will be held in Colombo. They will attempt to sell their ideas to a judging panel comprising of members of the ICT industry at the event. The Oslo Innovation Week has earned a reputation as an important global event which looks for business solutions to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by combining three important areas - entrepreneurship, technology and innovation. During the pitching event in Colombo, the judging panel will also expect the startups to follow the areas of requirement of the Oslo Innovation Week.
ICT Norway, the trade organisation for the Norwegian ICT industry, with the assistance of the Norwegian Embassy in Colombo has been at the forefront to help develop Sri Lankas ICT sector. In fulfilling this objective, ICT Norway and SLASSCOM have also partnered to initiate a unique programme called Kids Can Code which aims to help the younger generation in Sri Lanka to be more technologically creative and become experts in IT. Tiqri organized a briefing session for companies on how they could create their own coding clubs for kids between the ages of 9 to 16 was held on August 25, 2017.
The tie up between SLASSCOM and ICT Norway to strengthen Sri Lankas ICT sector, is also seen as an effort to further enhance the bilateral relationship between the two countries. The programmes implemented in Sri Lanka, which are a result of a Memorandum of Understanding signed between ICT Norway and SLASSCOM in June 2016 are being financed by the Norwegian government.
They focus mainly on empowering women and children as well as education and enhancing creativity through innovation. The MoU also paves the way for both bodies to come together and help modernize the maritime and fish farming industry in Sri Lanka by utilizing technology in an innovative way.

Storm Harvey: Up to 2,000 rescued as Houston hit by 'catastrophic floods'

Up to 2,000 people have been rescued from floods in and around Houston, as Tropical Storm Harvey continues to batter Texas with heavy rains.
There are reports of possible deaths in submerged vehicles, but investigations continue, Chief Darryl Coleman of the Harris County Sheriff's Office said.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott told the media he could not confirm storm-related deaths.
The National Weather Service (NWS) says conditions are "unprecedented".
It said there was a "flash flood emergency" across the Houston Metro area, with travel near impossible.
Many shelters have been opened, including in a convention centre.
Governor Abbott said about 250 roads and motorways had been closed in Texas and that he had made a federal disaster declaration for 19 counties that was granted by President Donald Trump.
"We are dealing with a triangle of ongoing rain, including Houston, Victoria and Corpus Christi cities," Abbott said.
"We will continue receiving incredibly heavy rain."
The NWS earlier noted reports of five deaths in the area, but only one fatality in Houston has been confirmed.
Two deaths have so far been confirmed from the storm since it made landfall:
In Aransas County, where Rockport is the chief town, a person died in a house fire on Friday night
A woman died in Houston as she drove through flooded streets on Saturday
Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner has urged residents not to call emergency services unless their situation is life-threatening and they need to be rescued.
"Don't get on the road. Don't assume this storm is over," he said.
Officials in Harris County, of which Houston is the county seat, have asked people who own boats to help with rescues.
Houston Bush Airport has announcedthat all commercial flight operations have been stopped until further notice. Houston's other airport, Hobby, is also shut, with runways completely flooded.
In Washington, the White House said that President Trump would visit Texas on Tuesday to survey storm damage. Trump had earlier said that he would go as soon as it was possible to do so "without causing disruption".
Inside Houston a disaster is unfolding. The motorways are deserted except for fire engines, police cars and other emergency vehicles.
Moving around the city is extremely difficult and dangerous. And yet some people are still driving, adding to the pressure on city authorities
Everywhere you look cars are being abandoned as people scramble to find high ground. Roads have turned to rivers along which evacuees are being taken to safety in boats and in army-style, open-back lorries.
They are huddled together under blankets and towels, glad to be alive. And still the rain comes teeming down, bouncing off the ground and bursting out of drains.
Houston is facing a crisis on an unprecedented scale.
Flooding in the Houston area is expected to worsen and "could become historic", with "potentially significant flooding also expected in other saturated areas of south-east [Texas]",the forecaster says.
Like Houston, the island city of Galveston was also hit by "epic catastrophic flooding" overnight, the NWS added.
An inundated care home in Dickinson, Galveston County, is reported to have been evacuated by helicopter after an image ofseveral elderly women sitting in a lounge in waist-deep waterwent viral on social media.
Rescue efforts are being hampered by strong winds and thousands are without power. The US Coast Guard in Houston has requested more helicopters as more people ask for help.
Abbott earlier said another 40in of rain could be due before the storm subsides midweek.
Houston is the country's fourth biggest city, with 6.6m people living in the metropolitan area.
Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil has said it is shutting down the second-largest refinery in the country, at Baytown. The Texas Gulf Coast is a key centre of the US oil and gas industry. Harvey began as a major category four hurricane - the first to make landfall in the US in 13 years when it arrived late Friday - but was downgraded to a tropical storm later on Saturday.
It is forecast to meander across south-east Texas until Wednesday.
The storm is the strongest to hit the US since Charley in August 2004 and the most powerful to hit Texas since Hurricane Carla in 1961, which killed 34 people, according to the Houston Chronicle.

Sustainable ship management focus at marine conference
Asia Marine Colombo, a joint venture between Mercantile Marine Management Limited and reputed ship management company Reederei NSB based in Buxtehude Germany, reiterated its commitment to growing knowledge and competencies in specialized marine HR solutions by holding an NSB Marine Officers Conference in Colombo recently.
Mercmarine Crew Management, which has always focused on providing specialized marine HR solutions, combined Reederei NSBs global expertise which it garners through its four Asia Marine offices in the Philippines, China, Korea and Sri Lanka to augment its strategy of building its own marine HR capability, while reducing exposure to third party crew management companies.
With the participation of 85 officers drawn from Sri Lanka, the Philippines and China, the theme of Sustainable Ship Management was discussed and disseminated at length, led by a collective of international resource persons.
This conference, the first of two conferences held by Asia Marine Colombo annually, covered safety, loss prevention, best practices, performance and efficiency standards and the ideal state of vessel performance for the future.
As Managing Director and Chief Operating Officer of Reederei NSB Tim Ponath said, Meeting this many officers of the company in one location to exchange ideas, thoughts and experiences on operating ships in the current market surrounds is a rare opportunity. I observe positive developments on the subjects we are addressing and even more important, a growing camaraderie with the management of the NSB Group and our officers from Sri Lanka, sailing our vessels.
Reederei NSB added an impressive range of expertise into this conference with Fleet Training Manager Thorsten Iborg, Marine Superintendent Nadine Letzner, Fleet Manager Sebastian Boll, Technical Superintendent Ronny Meier, Head of Supply Chain Management Christian Sinz, crew Planner Sergejs Aleksejevs and Nautical Superintendent and CSO Nina Lestojas sharing a wide and expansive purview with the participants.
A Master on the NSB Fleet, Captain Prawala Perera says that with the industry changing even more dramatically in the last few years, shipping companies are forced to focus on environmental and sustainability issues more than at any other time in history.
But the focus revolves holistically on the 3Ps, People-Planet-Profit, requiring companies to be economically viable even amid intense competition, prolonged recessions and overcapacity of tonnage. Clientele too has become more discerning and the industry highly regulated. As seafarers, we have felt the permeating impacts and sustainable ship management therefore is about questing for opportunities and embracing them to evolve successfully with these transformations.
By creating our own Marine HR capability, the JV enables us to monitor and control the crew employed on our vessels better, when it comes to quality and selection criteria so that the caliber of Officer is always very high, says General Manager Asia Marine Colombo Captain Frank Uwe Schneider.
With Asia Marine Colombo having firmly gained the crown of being the catalyst and trendsetter in crew performance, office operations and imbuing best practices among the Asia Marine Offices in the rest of the world, currently, the company has a total crew pool of 254 seafarers.
This pool comprises Officers and Ratings and a fleet of five container vessels under full crew management of 22 personnel each, seven container vessels and two oil tankers.

Taste of India
Prasthaan a Bollywood themed Street Food Festival organized by the Batch Eight students of the William Angliss Institute was certainly a night to remember with unforgettable memories. The way the evening was put together really was amazing. It was the result of hard work and sincere commitment on the part of the students.
The evening also had an educational element to it. The 8th Batch students event "Prasthaan" will be their final Assessment in the Advanced Diploma. It was obvious that this was an exemplary effort put together by very passionate students. They can be very satisfied with their work, because of the revelry of the crowd gathered. It was a purely fun event on one hand for all those that partied that day, but on the other hand putting something like Prasthaan it must have been very demanding.
"Prasthaan" was supported by the Indian Cultural Centre, Australian High Commission and the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau.
The students selected the name Prasthaan because of its finality and new beginning. It is the end of campus life and the beginning of a life out there in the world beyond the portals of Wiliam Angliss.
The purpose of organizing full on Bollywood, such a spectacular event is to create incredible memories with a touch of India for all the people attending. This event will highlight the Indian culture by showcasing the street food, glamorous fashion of India as well as incorporating Indian music and dance. India, Sri Lanka and Australia have always had good relations. The leaders of all three countries have a mutual desire for friendly ties with each other. Therefore it is no surprise that the event had a Bollywood theme which makes it rather cosmopolitan. Ultimately these students will be the future of the hospitality industry. The Hospitality industry is one of the most essential industries in the world. It is this industry that forms connections between cultures. It is this industry that promotes friendships. It is this industry that carries the message that our similarities should bring us even closer and that our differences would create opportunities for understanding.
The world is full of hate and violence. But no one is born hating. It is something that we learn and love is something, the Hospitality industry teaches us. Therefore these students are emissaries and messengers of hospitality.
Australian Deputy High Commissioner Tim Huggins commented that he really appreciated and was excited by the magnitude of the event. He called the event everything that one could imagine. First thing is, I want to tell all of you in the committee, that you have put together a truly awesome show. It is a pretty amazing set up. Huggins pointed out that Bollywood is big in his family with his wife being of Indian Origin and said he is a big fan of Bollywood culture. As it so happens Bollywood is making its presence felt in Australia. There is a big fan base there. We had Aishwarya Rai in Melbourne this week for an Indian Film Festival. Also the first female action hero in Bollywood was an Australian woman! Huggins also commented that he finds Indian street food fantastic. Huggins addressed the students and said that the career they have chosen in the hospitality industry is a wonderful and wise choice.
He said it is important because it makes a huge difference in peoples lives such as a wedding or a honeymoon or a holiday or any other function. Hospitality professionals make it great. You have chosen a great career which makes a big contribution to other things. It is a fun industry to work in. It is a booming industry here in Sri Lanka. Institute Steven Bradie Milles, CEO, William Angliss commended the Batch eight for holding such a great event which has been planned for a long period of time. He commented it was a privilege for him to witness such a great performance. Obviously one knows that it is part of the curriculum. I have been really interested in the team work of this batch. The team work and diversity is one of the reasons that this event is a success today. This event actually corresponds with the Indian Independence Day which is one of the reasons it is a Bollywood styled party. Milles commented that he is impressed by the arrangements, the stage, lighting, dance and music.
He also commented that the committee has done a fantastic job with the food. I want to thank Kasun Abeynayake and other staff members who have worked extremely hard. They are a truly admirable batch. I need to thank Chef Kapila and his staff in the kitchen. I wish to thank both the Australian High Commission for their support. It is great to have that connection. Lastly I wish to say that it has been a privilege supporting these young individuals.40 students will be leaving the institute. Milles commented on how close students and teachers are at the institute. They will be missed by the staff.
The students met with Rajashree Behera, The Director- Indian Cultural Centre who helped us in terms of the cultural segments of dance and music. The students also approached Charlotte Blundell - Counsellor and Dulani Sirisena - Program Manager of the Australian High Commission who agreed to help the students by promoting the event within the Australian community.

Thoughts on Gardening
* "Gardening is the art that uses flowers and plants as paint, and the soil and sky as canvas."- Elizabeth Murray
* "Gardening is a labour full of tranquility and satisfaction; natural and instructive, and as such contributes to the most serious contemplation, experience, health and longevity."- John Evelyn, 1666
* "A garden really lives only insofar as it is an expression of faith, the embodiment of a hope and a song of praise."- Russell Page, The Education of a Gardener, 1962
* "Bad Gardens copy, good gardens create, great gardens transcend. What all great gardens have in common are their ability to pull the sensitive viewer out of him or herself and into the garden, so completely that the separate self-sense disappears entirely, and at least for a brief moment one is ushered into a nondual and timeless awareness. A great garden, in other words, is mystical no matter what its actual content."- Ken Wilbur, Grace and Grit
* "Show me your garden and I shall tell you what you are."- Alfred Austin
* "Gardening is any way that humans and nature come together with the intent of creating beauty."- Tina James
* "Garden: One of a vast number of free outdoor restaurants operated by charity-minded amateurs in an effort to provide healthful, balanced meals for insects, birds and animals."- Henry Beard and Roy McKie, Gardener's Dictionary
* "It is always exciting to open the door and go out into the garden for the first time on any day."- Marion Cran
* "Gardening is medicine that does not need a prescription ... And with no limit on dosage."- Author unknown
* "Gardening gives one back a sense of proportion about everything - except itself."- May Sarton, Plant Dreaming Deep, 1968
* "What, if anything, do the infinity of different traditional and individual ideas of a garden have in common They vary so much in purpose, in size, in style and content that not even flowers, or even plants at all, can be said to be essential.
In the last analysis there is only one common factor between all gardens, and this is the control of nature by man. Control, that is, for aesthetic reasons. .... The essence is control. Without constant watchful care a garden - any garden - rapidly returns to the state of the country all around it." - Hugh Johnson, The Principles of Gardening, 1979
* "I don't think we'll ever know all there is to know about gardening, and I'm just as glad there will always be some magic about it!"- Barbara Damrosch

Farmers in Embilipitiya allege that farm wells they use for cultivation down the ages are running dry due to big tube wells dug by three private companies in the area.
Embilipitiya Weerabahu Farmers Society Secretary W. Kularatne said tube wells established by the three firms were 300 feet deep and they used motors to pump water. Therefore, most of the underground sprouts had gone dry, the farmers complain.
They request authorities to intervene and protect the water resources of farmers from the three companies.

Tourist arrivals  up 4.5%
Tourist arrivals recorded an increase of 4.5 per cent, year-on-year, with 123,351 tourists arriving during the month of June 2017.
On a cumulative basis, tourist arrivals grew by 4.8 per cent during the first half of 2017 compared to the corresponding period of 2016.
Following the same trend in tourist arrivals, earnings from tourism also increased to US dollars 211.6 million in June 2017. Consequently, on a cumulative basis, earnings from tourism increased by 4.8 per cent to US dollars 1, 733.6 million during the first half of 2017.
A decline in tourist arrivals from the Middle East, the low growth in Chinese tourist arrivals as well as the
rescheduling of some flights due to the resurfacing of the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) can be partly attributed to the moderate growth in earnings from tourism during the first half of 2017.

UNP backbenchers demand PSC on Uma Oya debacle
The UNP backbenchers have submitted a Resolution proposing to appoint a Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) to look into issues pertaining to Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project and report the findings to Parliament.
The Resolution signed by 13 UNP MPs has been included in the Addendum to the Order Book of Parliament issued last Friday. It proposes to appoint a 21 member committee to re-assess the implementation and effect of the project and report to Parliament within six months. The committee will be entrusted to determine whether a proper and comprehensive feasibility study was done prior to embarking on the project and whether a proper and realistic cost estimate was prepared for it. It will look into any unrealistic cost overruns in the implementation of the project.
The Committee has also been entrusted on identifying the persons responsible in preparing the project reports and whether there had been negligence on their part. The proposed PSC will determine whether any person or persons were guilty of any fraudulent or criminal activity in awarding the contract for the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project.
The resolution, mentioning the adverse effects of the project experienced in several areas in Bandarawela since December 2014 such as lowering of the water level in domestic wells, drying up of natural springs and development of cracks on walls and floors of houses and on the ground, proposes the Committee to find out the persons or institutions responsible for them. The proposed committee will also decide on the compensation for people affected by the project.
The Resolution has been signed by UNP MPs Chaminda Wijesiri, A. Aravindh Kumar, Ravindra Samaraweera, Sandith Samarasinghe, J. M. Ananda Kumarasiri, Prof. Ashu Marasinghe, Vadivel Suresh, Harin Fernando, J.C. Alawathuwala, Mujibur Rahuman, Edward Gunasekara, Ashoka Priyantha, and Mylvaganam Thilakarajah.

Warwicks beat Surrey to enter T20 Blast semis
LONDON: Grant Elliott scored an unbeaten 59 as Warwickshire chased 205 with four balls left to beat Surrey in the fourth T20 Blast quarter-final at The Oval.
Elliott survived a review for a catch by Rory Burns when on 46 but went on to share an unbeaten 64-run partnership with Colin de Grandhomme (39 not out).
Warwicks reached 207-4 after Surrey had earlier posted 204-5 in their 20 overs as Jason Roy top-scored (74).
They will face Glamorgan in their last-four tie at Finals Day on 2 September.
Hampshire will take on Notts Outlaws in the other semi-final at Edgbaston.
New Zealand international Elliott, captain of Warwicks after Ian Bell's decision to step down, was given not out by the on-field umpires when Burns was convinced he had caught him in the deep diving forward.
Following numerous television replays, he survived and went on to take his side into a home Finals Day.
Surrey's innings tailed away after Roy (74 off 38 balls) and Aaron Finch (39 off 27 balls) had shared a 98-run opening partnership in just 9.1 overs. Finch was forced to bat with a runner after he injured his right calf when getting off the mark.

When challenges get tougher
August 2017 marks two years of the National Unity government formed after the general elections of August 2015, which followed the historic presidential elections earlier that year, which ended unceremoniously and two years ahead of schedule the rule and reign of the Rajapaksa clan. Ending Rajapaksa rule, was a remarkable rainbow coalition of practically everyone else but the Rajapaksas their UPFA, Mahinda Rajapaksa having the unique skill of uniting almost every other political shade of opinion in the country against himself, from the Sinhala nationalist JHU, to the JVP, the UNP, General Fonsekas Democrats, every Muslim party and the TNA, in a broad rainbow coalition against Rajapaksa rule. The general election which followed essentially witnessed President Sirisenas political allies win power and confirmed the decline of the Rajapaksa brand, the UPFAs popular vote declining between January and August that year. Two years on, there seem little nostalgia for a Rajapaksa return, their political organs of the Joint Opposition and the SLPP, blowing hot air and some barely concealed racism but not making much traction either in Parliament or outside.
The Government of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was elected on a three-fold agenda of greater democratization, economic reform and reconciliation. It is perhaps in the area of democratization that the Government has the most impressive gains to date, with the passage of the 19th Amendment to the constitution and the Right to Information Act, the latter with the potential to significantly increase the transparency and accountability of Sri Lankan governance.
In terms of reconciliation the Government co-sponsored the UNHRC resolution on reconciliation in Sri Lanka demonstrating its own commitment to the same, cooperates with UN Special mandate holders and, opened up civil society space in post war rehabilitation, facilitated the smooth functioning of the provincial councils by replacing intransigent retired military governors with civilians in the North and East and released significant amounts of lands occupied by the military during the conflict, including the Mylatti fisheries harbour in the North and Sampoor in the East.
The Tamil Diaspora groups were engaged with, de-proscribing a large number of Diaspora organisations and persons and encouraging them to be partners in rehabilitation and post war reconstruction, while the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) Act, was also passed. There still remains much to be done in relation to reconciliation, especially making progress on devolution and constitutional reform. Tamil political opinion and actors have chaffed though at the complicated politics and inherent delays in effecting further progress on reconciliation measures.
Economic reforms
It is however in the area of economic reform and development that there has been some disquiet with the voting public expecting a quick good governance dividend which it has not seen forthcoming thus far. However, Rome was not built in a day and economic reforms take time to bear fruit. But most importantly Sri Lankas economy was set for a hard landing, a correction after the second Rajapaksa terms borrow and spend binge. Government investment on borrowed funds in white elephant projects of dubious utility value, like the Mattala airport and the Hambanthota port, meant that a slowdown from ceasing the borrow and spend binge was inevitable.
One of the best kept secrets in recent times has been the Mahinda Rajapaksa decision to call presidential elections two year before they were due. His astrologers, magicians and soothsays notwithstanding it is quite likely that Percy Mahinda Rajapaksa was well advised that he could not indefinitely borrow and spend on projects that gave no economic returns. The election of January 2015, might well have been his bet to avoid an election in the likely economic pain his policies were bringing and would bite by 2017.
Needless hot air over leasing state assets
A key strategy of the economic reforms of the government has been attracting foreign direct investment and as western commercial capital has been harder to access amidst fierce Asias wide competition for the same, the Unity Government has sought to change the policy of borrow at commercial rates adopted by the Rajapaksa regime to a lease and invest equity approach to regional economic giants, both India and China. Now the Rajapaksa Administration ignored India and courted only China, to the detriment of Sri Lankas national interest, while the National Unity Government once again rebalanced Sri Lankas foreign policy, a return to the status quo ante, of our previous policy of friendly relations and close economic ties with both India, our largest trading partner and China our largest foreign investor.
There has been needless hot air and distortions over the ETCA with India, leasing the oil tank farms to the Indian oil company, the Mattala airport to also to an Indian firm and of course the Hambanthota port deal to a Chinese state owned fame which incidentally cost the former Justice Minister his job for intemperate comments regarding the Government approved US Dollar one billion deal.
The political hot air over leasing public assets to foreign investors, is uncalled for, since leasing is merely a project financing option, which is definitely more beneficial than borrowing for that same public project or asset. In the case of the Hambanthota port or the Mattala airport, sovereign borrowings to build and operate the projects, incidentally at a loss as well, essentially mortgages the countrys future tax revenues to build and operate these projects. The option of leasing is merely a financing option, which is definitely preferable to massive loans at commercial rates of interest.
With regard to strategic assets such as ports and airports Sri Lanka should take into consideration and be mindful of the security interests and concerns of its giant neighbour, again in its own interest, regional cooperation on matters of security, trade and investment being the way forward for Sri Lanka. All the economic growth forecasts for the future predict an increasingly robust growth for the Indian economy which would see its economy outpace even the Chinese one. Sri Lanka must position herself early through smart diplomacy and an enlightened foreign policy to benefit from the regional economic boom, poised to be powered by India.

Why cheese is the super food you need to know about
Forget green tea and blueberries, the latest superfood could be cheese - after a new study found that it may make you live longer.
Probiotics found in Swiss cheeses - such as Emmental and Gruyre  could help reduce inflammation and subsequently boost immunity.
These probiotics, which are also found in other dairy products such as milk, can also improve signs of ageing, the study claims. So far, the research has only been carried out on roundworms, however the authors claim that it is possible the results are also applicable to humans.
Emmental contains Propionibacterium freudenreichii, a bacterium which proved to boost the worms longevity and subsequently turns lactate into acetate, propionate and carbon dioxide.
Acetate and propionate are known for their immune-boosting properties, particularly within the human gut, the study claims.
The researchers concluded that the probiotics in Swiss cheeses extend lifespan by protecting against pathogens, provoking an anti-inflammatory effect on the immune system and lowering the bodys stress responses.
Its not the first time weve tried legitimising our deepest Roquefort fantasies.
Apparently, eating aged cheeses such as cheddar and brie could also extend lifespan, whilst another study earlier this year claimed that cheese-eaters were slimmer than those who avoided the tantalising treat.
Theres even evidence to suggest that regularly consuming cheese can protect you from heart disease.
If that doesnt brie-ton your day, what will

Why comics
Marvel Studios is currently filming two Avengers sequels in one more or less unbroken block  well over a year of shooting at the cost of more than a billion dollars. Star salaries are a big part of the price; Robert Downey Jr will reportedly make over $100 million, with more than twenty other A-list actors in the mix. Downey starred in Iron Man (2008), which Kevin Feige, Marvel Studios president, described as the beginning of our MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe, for those not in the superhero know).
The sixteen MCU movies to date have racked up over $12 billion in worldwide box office takings. It isnt clear what that means in profits to Marvel and its partners, given production, marketing and distribution costs, along with backend payments to actors and others, but the willingness to chuck another billion into two movies indicates Marvel has done very well by adapting comic books. On June 29, Box Office Mojo listed twenty-nine comic book adaptations to be released over the next few years. Sony, Warner Brothers and Fox join Disney, Marvels chief partner, with multiple entries.
Inevitable impace
The turn to comic book movies seems born of marketing necessity. Box-office stagnation in North America, a much-noted phenomenon, is driving Hollywoods push into foreign markets. This has an inevitable impact on the type of movie produced, as Derek Thompson observed in the Atlantic. The necessity to create a single product for a global crowd encourages studios to produce the artistic equivalent of Rosetta Stones, interpretable for many tongues.
There is no language in the world more universal than heroes destroying bad guys with explosions. Steven Soderbergh, in his keynote address to the 2013 San Francisco International Film Festival, stressed the artistic downside: Obviously the bigger the budget, the more people this thing is going to have to appeal to, the more homogenized its got to be, the more simplified its got to be. So things like cultural specificity and narrative complexity, and, God forbid, ambiguity, those become real obstacles to the success of the film here and abroad.
Complexity and ambiguity were standard components of the fondly remembered films of the 1970s. Film financiers had reason not to mind. Taxi Driver (1976) was made for a little over a million dollars and brought in more than twenty times as much at the box office. The Godfather (1972), wildly over budget at $6 million, brought in $138 million in its initial release. France may support its movies with a billion dollars a year in funding, and quotas on foreign films, but the six major Hollywood studios and the couple dozen smaller American movie-makers are fuelled by profits.
Dollop of censorship
The average cost for a major motion picture is now about $60 million before marketing costs, and it seems like comic book movies cant be made for less than $100 million.
China will have 80,000 movie theatres by 2021, twice the North American count. If simplification and, in the case of places like China, a dollop of censorship are the price, Hollywood is in. We will look the other way if the occasional Nobel Peace Prize winner suffers long imprisonment, death in captivity and a closed-door funeral. Umberto Eco would have expected no less. Writing in The Myth of Superman (1962) about the politics of the comic books on which these movies are based, Eco rhetorically asked why Superman didnt use his powers to find the solution of hunger problems or to liberate six hundred million Chinese from the yoke of Mao
He concluded that Superman was reactive instead of proactive as a way of maintaining the (capitalist) status quo. He is busy by preference, not against blackmarket drugs, nor, obviously, against corrupt administrators and politicians, but against bank and mail-truck robbers. In other words, the only visible form that evil assumes is an attempt on private property.
This was good for the serial return of comic book heroes  there is an endless supply of common criminals to be pursued and captured  but led to narrative stasis. By simply battling bad guy after bad guy rather than tilling uninhabited regions or destroying inhuman systems, Eco argues, comic books are deprived of narrative development and the superhero, by definition the hero whom nothing can impede, finds himself in the worrisome narrative situation of being a hero without an adversary and therefore without the possibility of any development.
Superhero Movies
Critics have been making the same points ever since. The Superhero Franchise: Where traditional movie stardom goes to die (New York Times, 2016) and The Reason Why Hollywood Makes So Many Boring Superhero Movies (the Atlantic, 2014) are just a couple of typical mainstream press headlines. A recent headline in the Guardian compared the rise of Donald Trump to Americas need for superheroes. And Keith A. Spencer points out on Salon that:
with few exceptions, superhero blockbusters read as if they were underwritten by the American Enterprise Institute. Thats because nearly all superhero movies glorify wealth (and the freedom it provides), aristocracy and/or monarchy, militarism, unilateralism, and right-wing fantasies about criminality.
The billion dollar Avengers movies were filming in Atlanta this spring, where I was line producing a comparatively moderately budgeted Christmas comedy. Atlanta is a good place to make movies, providing a decent crew base, lots of stage space, plenty of hotels and short-term housing, good restaurants and a variety of location looks. Most crucially, though, the city is located in Georgia, a state with a film tax credit that allows Hollywood studios to get back close to 30 per cent of what they spend in the state, including payments to actors and other above-the-line types, such as producers and directors.
A number of other states offer film tax credits but none currently includes above the line spending, has no caps on actor salaries, and gives a 30 per cent credit. In Georgia, after a movie is finished and an audit is performed, the production company is issued a tax certificate, which can be used against the companys own tax bill or can be sold at a discount to a tax-paying entity. For budgeting purposes, we assume the credit will be sold and well get 90 cents or so on the dollar, or about 27 per cent of the production spend. Thats an enormous and rare benefit. It will save my Christmas movie millions of dollars  it will save the Avengers films vastly more.

Workers remittances down 13.5%
A significant slowdown in workers remittances was observed in June 2017 with a 13.5 per cent reduction in remittances on a year-on-year basis amounting to US dollars 557.6 million during the month.
The continued decline in workers remittances can be primarily attributed to the adverse economic and geopolitical conditions prevailing in the Middle Eastern region.
Consequently, inflows from workers remittances declined by 7.2 per cent on a cumulative basis to US dollars 3,354.7 million during the first half of 2017, in comparison to the corresponding period of 2016.

Zahira College celebrates 125th Founders Day anniversary
The historical process of establishing Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and Muslim schools over the past 150 years undoubtedly played a major role in uplifting our communities educationally. The standards introduced by American and British missionary schools upgraded the quality of life of all Sri Lankans.
We are no doubt are appreciative of these colonial time rewards, said Presidents Counsel M. M. Zuhair, an old boy of the Zahira College, making the key note address at the 125th anniversary of the Founders Day of Zahira College at the College Ghaffoor Hall on August 21. A large and representative gathering of old boys and parents attended the event. The Chairman of the Board of Governors Fouzul Hameed presided.
Speaking further, former Parliamentarian Zuhair queried, Did this colonial process also result in undue divisions and excessive communal compartmentalization amongst us Sri Lankans Did it also damage even partially, the prospects of establishing healthy co-existence among the different communities and unity amidst diversity Did this process together with other factors also contribute negatively towards advancing the Sri Lankan identity and national integration Did this communal divide at the schools level unwittingly contribute to a series of ethnic oriented conflicts and religious confrontations that post-independent Sri Lanka had undergone at regular intervals
He said the need for reconciliation mechanisms in the country appears to be also due to a century and a half of this compartmentalization. There are also those who argue that the British policy of divide and rule, led to the present ethnically divisive and at times confrontational politics in our country. The British may have had their own good reasons for their puckish policy of divide and rule, but what reasons does independent Sri Lanka have to hang on to this poisonous snake for nearly 70 years since independence
There are experts in this field who need to find answers to these questions. They must assess the changing roles that are being expected from our schools and the universities. All I wish to say is that the present school system ought not to be changed overnight. There must be due consultation with all stakeholders before major changes to the existing character of the schools are effected, he added.
Zahira College had always accommodated a recognizable percentage of students from the Sinhala and Tamil communities. During the stewardship of A. M. A. Azeez as Principal of the 138 Zahirians who entered the Faculties of the then Ceylon University, 37 were Sinhalese, while 21 were Tamils. Fifty eight or 80 percent were Muslims. Like Zahira College, there are other schools which also accommodate a fair number of students from other communities. But there are also leading national-level schools which accommodate students virtually from a single ethno-religious group only. Such practices violate fundamental rights. These indeed require political decisions to pave way for reasonable integration, while respecting diversity, Zuhair said.
Ethnic and religious co-existence must begin from classrooms. Respect for other beliefs and cultures must echo from all schools, particularly from the level of the teachers and the school environment. When I spoke at Ananda College recently, I urged the Anandians to lead the country in uniting the people as Sri Lankans if the nation is to progress economically and free itself from external economic bondage. Our duty is to create a friendly environment for sustainable security for every child. We need to overcome the forces that seek to divide us. Today, I am urging the Zahirians to build closer rapport with Buddhist, Hindu, Christian and Catholic schools in the neighbourhood, in the fields of sports and literary activities and overcome the excessive compartmentalization, he added.
Principal of Zahira College Trizviiy Marikkar, Vice Principals A. M. Mihlar and M. T. A. Rauf also spoke at the 125th anniversary celebrations.
