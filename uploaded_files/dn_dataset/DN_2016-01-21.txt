Bill of Local Authorities Elections challenged in SC
A Special Determination petition challenging the constitutionality of the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill was yesterday filed before the Supreme Court seeking a determination that several clauses of the said Bill are inconsistent with several Articles of the Constitution.
The petition had been filed by Attorney-at-Law Nuwan Ballantudawa through Attorney-at-Law H. M. Thillakarathne and Kanishka Vitharana. The petitioner further sought a declaration that the Bill shall become law only through a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
The petitioner said the Bill of "Local Authorities Elections (Amendment)" presented to the Parliament and placed on the Order Paper of the Parliament on January 12, 2016.
The Petitioner states the clauses 2, 3, 4,5,6,7 of the Bill are in violation of and are inconsistent with Articles 3, 4, 10, 12(1), 12(2), 14 and other Articles of the Constitution.
The petitioner further stated that clauses 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the said Bill are infringing the franchise of the youth and their rights to contest at the Local Authorities Elections as recognised and secured by section 28 (2)(B) of the present Act.
The petitioner said the Bill paves way and vests with the secretaries of the contesting political parties, absolute and unfettered right to act arbitrarily in nominating and qualifying members to the vacancies of the respective local authorities, by disregarding the order of priority previously specified and declared in the lists of candidates in the respective nomination papers.
The petitioner maintained that, this clause undermines and infringes the sovereignty of the people relating to franchise and freedom of thought and expression.

Indians implode despite twin tons
CANBERRA; The fourth ODI between Australia and India at Canberra saw nearly 700 runs scored, but India collapsed in dramatic fashion to lose by 25 runs, despite being on course to reach the target of 349 after early centuries.
Australia made 348 for eight in their 50 overs, with a ton from Aaron Finch and 93 from David Warner. India then seemed well of track, as Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli put on a double century stand, both making hundreds.
But India choked thanks to some clever bowling from Kane Richardson, who took five wickets, but it was more a case of throwing their wickets away once the centurions were out. They collapsed from 277/1 to 323 all out.
Australia won the toss and opted to bat, having already won the series and looking for a whitewash. Once again, their top order set about piling on the runs against a poor India bowling attack, and openers Finch and Warner raced to a century stand.
The pair put on 187 for the first wicket inside 30 overs, before Warner was bowled by Ishant Sharma for 93. Mitchell Marsh was promoted up the order to three but batted relatively slowly for his 33.
At the other end, Finch made 107 off the same number of balls, while Steve Smith smacked 51 off 29 deliveries. A few wickets then fell, making the certain 350 seem impossible.
But Glenn Maxwell once again showed his skills by hitting 41 unbeaten runs off 20 balls at the death. He hit 18 runs off the last over, so while they may not have reached 350, a score of 348 was close enough.
But it didn't seem like enough when Dhawan and Kohli were batting (Rohit Sharma out cheaply) as they looked to demolish the home bowling. James Faulkner was particularly savaged, going for 48 runs in seven overs.
But then John Hastings struck to remove Kohli and MD Dhoni in the same over, the latter for a duck, and everything fell apart from there. India's batsmen made little attempt to play proper cricket shots, despite still only needing a run per ball.
After the centurions, the only batsman below the top three to reach double figures was Ravi Jadeja, who made 24 not out as he watched the wickets tumble at the other end, mostly to Richardson.
Mitch Marsh took the final two wickets, with a few dropped catches going unpunished, as India needed 26 runs off the final over. Australia bowled them out with four balls to spare.

J K Rowling Reveals what she told Alan Rickman about Snape
Alan Rickman once revealed that 'Harry Potter' author J K Rowling shared "one tiny, little, left of field piece of information" which shaped his performance as Professor Severus Snape.
But what exactly was it
Apparently, it helped Rickman to realise that there was more to Snape than a mere textbook villain. But it's always remained a mystery... until now.
After the death of Alan Rickman last week, the author herself answered some questions about Rickman's performance on Twitter... and revealed to one fan exactly what it is that she said to him.
"Will you tell us the piece of information that you told Alan Rickman about Severus Snape" asked the Harry Potter fan. "Or will that forever be a secret"
"I told Alan what lies behind the word 'always'," she explained.
It may not seem like much, but according to Rickman himself, it helped him piece together the character throughout the 'Harry potter' films, and gave his performance far more depth than might have existed otherwise.
"[It] helped me think that he was more complicated and that the story was not going to be as straight down the line as everybody thought," Alan Rickman told HitFix in 2011. "When I did the first film she'd only written three or four books, so nobody knew where it was really going except her. And it was important for her that I know something, but she only gave me a tiny piece of information which helped me think it was a more ambiguous route." "What I knew was he was a human being and not an automaton and I knew there was some sense of protection for Harry or I worked that out," he said. "It was enough to know, I didn't know he was a double agent."
Of course, it turned out that Professor Snape - often considered to be one of the baddies of the 'Harry Potter' series - had been looking out for Harry all along... and this was revealed in the final film, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part Two'. It was an astounding revelation to those who had assumed the worst all along... and a fitting end to the story of one of 'Harry potter's most iconic characters.
Alan Rickman died 14 January at the age of 69.

A Special Determination petition challenging the Bill titled, "Theravada Bhikku Kathikawath (Registration)" was yesterday filed before the Supreme Court seeking a determination that several clauses of the said Bill are inconsistent with the Constitution.
Petitioner, Attorney-at-Law Nuwan Ballantudawa, Co-coordinator of the Global Sri Lankan Forum further sought a declaration that the Bill shall become law only through a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
The Petitioner states that the said Bill was presented to the Parliament and placed on the Order Paper of the Parliament on January 12, 2016. The Petitioner states the law intended to be enacted by clauses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 of the Bill would intrude into, distort and arbitrarily force to change the religious practices, recognised customs developed and followed by the Bhikkus for over thousands of years pertaining to Bikkhu Vinaya and discipline;
He further said the Bill would intrude into, distort and arbitrarily force to change the culture, cultural practices, customs, values and traditions of the people residing in Sri Lanka, especially of those belonging to the "Sinhalese nationality", whose culture has been developed, absorbed into and merged with the religious practices, customs and traditions of "the Buddha Sasana", as manifested, practiced and promoted by the Bhikkus in Sri Lanka for over thousands of years;
He further said the Bill would unwarrantedly and forcibly distort, destroy and change the fundamental traditions, customs and culture followed, practiced and developed by the people in Sri Lanka of giving the foremost place to Buddhism, in the spheres of both the State administration and day-to-day personal behaviour;
He further said the Bill would unlawfully and unfairly infringe and violate the religious and cultural rights and freedoms of the Sri Lankans and Buddhists living in Sri Lanka.
He further said, the new law would arbitrarily and irrationally create divisions and separations among the Bhikkus and the Buddhists living in Sri Lanka;
The petitioner observed that State legislation should not interfere with religion or cultural practices and customs (except to make laws to protect rights of those of other deprived religions and cultures).
He said the intended law would arbitrarily discriminate the Bhikkus against the Clergy of other religions in Sri Lanka;
The Attorney General was made a respondent to this application in terms of Article 134 (1) of the Constitution.
The petitioner had filed the petition through Counsel H. M. Thillakarathne and senior counsel Kanishka Vitharana.

Majority of ex SLFP LG councillors in Apura want to contest under MR front
More than 100 out of the total 137 former peoples representatives belonging to the SLFP in the Anuradhapura district met in Anuradhapura yesterday and unanimously decided to contest the forthcoming Local Government election from a new political front led by former President and Kuruengala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa. Among them were SLFP members of now the defunct 18 local councils and SLFP members in the Anuradhaprua Municipal Council. The participants at this meeting presided over by Anuradhapura Mayor H. P. Somadasa also said that they would not accept the present SLFP leadership ,fielding questions from the media. Anuradhapura Mayor Somadasa said the name or the symbol of the new political front did not matter but they would all join hands to contest under the new political front and its symbol.
He said that SLFP and the UNP did not contest the recently held election under their registered party.
He alleged that President Maithripala Sirisena acted according to the whims and fancies of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesighe. He said the present SLFP General Secretary was also unacceptable to them. Former member of the Talawa Pradeshiya Sabha Abeyratne Herath said the present SLFP General Secretary who was from his Kalawewa electorate was groping in the dark and he had failed to set up a single SLFP branch or Bala Mandalaya in the electorate with genuine SLFP members.
Meanwhile Former chairmen of the Talawa, Nochchiyagama and Horowpothana Pradehsiya Sabhas were conspicuous by their absence at this meeting. Former Chairman of the Nochchiyagama Pradesheeya Sabha Nalin Dissanayake when contacted said he and several other former SLFP local government representatives would never leave the SLFP. He said they were not informed about yesterdays meeting. Neither would they attend such type of meetings without the partys official approval.
They would never join these types of conspiracies hatched to promote the lot of Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila groups.

New Constitution will not affect unitary status of country - Amunugama
The unitary status of the country would never be affected by the new constitution to be drafted in the near future, said Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning, Dr. Sarath Amunugama.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have clearly noted that the unitary status included in the the present Constitution would remain unchanged in the new Constitution scheduled to be drafted. He said so addressing an SLFP weekly media briefing yesterday at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo.
Minister Amunugama added that certain politicians in the opposition, including Professor G.L. Peiris, Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila levelled baseless allegations that the unitary status of the country would be removed from the Constitution that is to be drafted.
The unitary status and prominent place for Buddhism would not be changed with the new Constitution under the presidency of President Sirisena, since unitary status was included to the Constitution by a then SLFP government on the advice of then Prime Minister the late Sirimavo Bandaranaike, he said.
Even though Professor G. L. Peiris speaks much on the unitary status of the country now, there had been no word about unitary status in the 2,000 Constitution which was drafted by him.
Speaking on the Therawada Kathikawatha Bill, Minister Amunugama said that it was formally drafted in 2011 due to continuous requests by the Three Chief Incumbents and the general public. The move to draft the Therawada Kathikawatha was accepted by all Sanga Sabhas. The Therawada Kathikawatha Bill was presented in Parliament for the betterment of the Maha Sangha and Buddhism.
However, the measures taken to present the Therawada Kathikawatha Bill in Parliament is being highly criticized by certain Bikkhus and people. Therefore, President Sirisena had said at a Cabinet meeting held recently the the Bill be studied at leisure and make amendments if necessary after considering the views of the Maha Sangha and the public.
Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that not even a single phrase of the new Constitution had yet been drafted. But several politicians are trying for political advantages, by leveling baseless allegations. The new Constitution would be prepared with the active participation of 225 members of Parliament.
When questioned as to whether former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and several SLFP parliamentarians were forming a new party with the aim of contesting the forthcoming local government elections, he said that no SLFP parliamentarian had said so.
No SLFP parliamentarians have said so. But opposition members of other parties say so. But people who are unable to win elections contesting alone, are trying to divide the SLFP, he said.

Second round survival and the gladiators standing tall
All is calm and wellness as the clubs switch radars for a strenuous second leg. Survival is the key...especially for the teams with injuries to key players, whose main focus is the fast track recovery for their club cause. Let's mention the Danushka Ranjan, most talented ...but sadly not in the middle for the Park club. Result - new centre combination of Niroshan and Hirantha, who well comprehend the top skills required, to have your no. 1 finishers job, handed to them. Add Dulaj to the rehabilitation list along with.Shenal Dias, and coach Llagga's friendly banter evaporates.
Havelocks, CR, and Navy have the keys to cause max damage; if they discover some stupendous belief and strategy to outplay Kandy, especially upfront...plans to outrun the backs will need special magic and Merlin's potion
CR's coach must be confident of releasing the Ashan de Costa, Ishan Noor, Kanchana Ramanayake, and the growing consistency of Sasanka Ariyaratne. If there is the example of hard work and workrate...Ariyaratne is in a class of his own.
He sets fire to the theory about flankers who are big and powerful by changing the dynamics to quick, sharp and impact fitness, both in set and loose play. He is a pleasure to watch...for CR fans ... but an annoying all purpose marauder, who thrives on tackling and causing max damage to opponents, both in attack and defence. He stands tall for his team and is definitely on my 2016 all stars squad.
The buzz about Police stepped up with a hard win against Navy at Police Park. Good news to see Rehan Weerakoon back at no. 10 and sharp to the boot on many levels ...he is the ideal all round rugby player with skills to match.
The plan for the blue shirts to create a rush is much overdue ...especially with Reza Mubarak, Henry, Dabare, Sherrif, and the might of Bilal 'tank' Hassen. Facts are harsh and I imagine the knockouts already looming large, and the possibility of some reward for their considerable investment this Dialog season - perhaps some words with my buddy Marso might be valuable insight for all of us fans
I am trying to understand the wisdom of the player transfer system ...where the club holds the contractual right to decide on shifting mid season. If the current club agrees to release a player ... then he is legal to play the next weekend.
The grapevine is buzzing with Danushka Ranjan news bytes about a move away from Colombo ... but futile rhetoric, given his injury status that is more damage than anticipated, possibly a few months to rehab and recover
On the bigger picture ...we need your island rugby experts, to start making lists of whom you think will make the grade for Sri Lanka in the Asian Championships this March.
Can we match Hong Kong, China, South Korea and the mighty high flying Asian giant and world's fav team, Japan Can Sri beef up a pack heavy enough to hold them in the sets for starters
Coach Eddie Jones already signed with ailing, smarting, and deeply concerned England for the next World Cup. If Jones can transform and revive a flagging RFU confidence and revamp the system ...is the question burning news wires in London. Twickenham is still lukewarm for the looming six nations grudge series.
My bet is on an Irish campaign that will smash defences and earn them new respect. Scotland will be oozing confidence and itching to run the ball from all corners ...they certainly have the firepower and balance upfront at Murrayfeild, to outplay the best on their day; recovered skills for skipper Laidlaw... bigger, better ...faster ... will this be the year the Scots set their own history and emerge as a world class XV ...postulating pundits and rugby all rounders pls ponders!
The subject of union affairs starts to do the legal rounds, with questions about the composition of teams, both senior and junior national squads ...coaching staff, management and player environment issues ...all part of the way forward.
Responsibility must be to establish a firm plan for the next 4 years ...target the priorities for 15s and 7s, and framework the whole blueprint.
I mentioned the wealth of homegrown experience that can be given scope and opportunity, from grassroots to national level.
The government must consider the phenomenon of rugby ...only second to cricket in Sri....harness the wealth of strong skilled young island men and women for our future, invest nurture and nourish mind and body. I believe we need to create a new generation of true island rugby players, fabulous examples of talented, skilled, strong, powerful, young Sri Warriors to impact Asia and then capture the imagination of the world.
Belief ...planning, investment, acumen, intellectual capacity and a burning desire to be the best ... a perfect platform to launch from.
Expectations are high!
Leaguewise ...Kandy are still untouched at the top and having a dream run with seven wins on the trot ...massive for coach Sean on debut as head coach. If destiny and high performance fitness clock in ...then only Havelock's and CR have fading hopes of derailing the Nittawela express that has been outstanding, and outplayed all comers in all departments.
Kandy's ability and skill set has been their focus for the full 80...a relentless hardwork ethic, quality players and team spirit, despite the odds.
Big hand to all coaching and management for the quality and performance level of all the teams in the Dialog league this season ... may it grow in skill, power and stature.
Bula bula the island players who carry a nations pride, long may it lead and prosper!

He first paid homage to the Sri Dalada Maligawa, where he was received by the Diyawadene Nilame and undertook religious observation. Thereafter, he drove to the Pallekelle International. Cricket Stadium and looked around the facilities that were available and that needed improvement.
On his inspection he first wanted to stop all work on the indoor net which is being built in the center of the car park. What cricket lovers can see are only the pillars and all other work is at a halt. This indoor net commenced during the term of the interim committee without a proper plan or a constructive proposal. Further they had failed to obtain authority for the land acquired from the state. It appeared that everything was virtually disorganized and without proper authority.
If one sees the amount of funds spent on this ground, it would seem very high, and a colossal amount of funds has been spent without justification to what has been undertaken. Everything that has been done at this venue has been at a very high financial expense, even the chairs supplied for this venue for the tiers are of a poor quality but priced very high. So, the new president has pledged that he is all out to put things in order, and has promised his best in due course.
He said that Sri Lanka Cricket is in the red right now, but was confident that he was capable of putting everything in place as soon as possible for the betterment of Sri Lanka Cricket.
Sumathipala also met a few of the Kandy District Cricket Association officials and some club representatives. He had talks with them too. Later he visited the Old Trinitians Sports Club at Asgiriya, which is housed at the Trinity College International Stadium.
Today, what the cricket lovers of Kandy need is club cricket to be brought back to where it was, and also give a helping hand to the clubs to play domestic cricket.
Kandy needs a good ground for school matches - only three schools out of ten have grounds to play matches and for practices.
However the schools are doing well at cricket because the game is promoted in the right way whereas the clubs have failed.
Cricket has a long history in Kandy, a game which has been played over here since 1863. It was mainly played in the Knuckes/Rangala areas and the Kandy city had the Kandy Dancing, Boating, and Rowing Club. In 1896 this club became the Kandy Sports Club.
The countrys first unofficial test was played in Kandy at Bogambara grounds in 1889. In August 1946 saw the revival of the Kandy District Association. Shortly after the Central Province Cricket Association was formed and that is the year Dr V.H.L. Anthonisz Shield was established for competition amongst clubs in the Kandy District.
Asgiriya Stadium is the private property of Trinity College Kandy and it became Sri Lanka's second Test venue after the P Sara Oval, when it hosted Greg Chappells Australian team in 1983. Then came the Pallekele Stadium which is owned by Sri Lanka Cricket.
The Pallekele International Stadium was the brainchild of former Minister of Sports & Tourism and present Minister of Highways and Higher education Lakshman Kiriella. He initiated it when he was the Sports Minister.

SLC suspends work on indoor net projects
Sri Lanka Cricket has temporarily suspended construction of the indoor nets projects at R. Premadasa Stadium, Pallekele and Dambulla due to SLC not obtaining approvals from the relevant authorities.
The newly elected Executive Committee headed by Thilanga Sumathipala has decided to re-assess the projects based on the high cost involved in construction (Rs.248 million) and the space allocation at the respective venues, states an SLC media release.
SLC will get the proper approvals from the relevant authorities and proceed with the work on the said projects on a priority basis.
Central Engineering Consulting Bureau (CECB) has been advised to present the progress of construction carried out at R. Premadasa Stadium and a new cost estimate for the said project.
The ExCo will study the new proposal from CECB and decide on the way forward which should not be too much of a strain on the finances of SLC.
