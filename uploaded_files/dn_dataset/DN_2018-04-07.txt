Trinity-Thomian Canon de Saram Shield rugby
There are some exciting rugby fixtures on the cards for today chiefly among them Trinity College hosting S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia.

St. Anthonys-Kingswood at Nittawela
A rousing game of rugby is on the cards when the two home teams in the inter-school division I tournament, Kingswood College and St. Anthonys College clash at Nittawela. Kingswood who beat Trinity College in their last outing, are capable of upsetting the Antonians, who are smarting after they were beaten by Josephians. In this game a fully fit Kigswoodians are expected to make a world of difference from the earlier three games. They are backed by a set of gallant fighters. Antonian trump card is their penetrative back line, who are level headed players, who can be good fighters if they play hard. So, in todays game, it all points to a battle of wits between Kingswood forwards and Antonian power play. A Jamaldeen will handle the whistle.

Madina Central College Madawala and Azhar College Akurana have a rich cricket history which shouldnt be buried with the sands of time. For the last four years the big match has not been played due to some problem. Madina Central College is a school that is from Madawala and Al Azhar College in Akurana. They have some good cricketers, and the encounter is named the Battle of the Double Maroons. This is the only big match in the country between two Muslim schools which commenced in 2008.

Malcolm at one time was the Sri Lanka Cricket Coaching Manager.
Great efforts made to revive netball
Efforts are being made to review netball in Kandy. Whatever the limited facilities, Kandy has continuously produced some of the top netballers. Netball has a long history over here.
The Kandy Netball Association should get together and organise a tournament among schools and clubs in the region. Kandy schools have a rich history in the sport of netball, having played the game much earlier than others. Kandy Girls High School became the first to play netball in Kandy in 1920.
Hillwood College in 1921 were the second school to play the sport. Later, Mahamaya Girls College which was started in the 1930s took up the game in a big way. Good Shepherd Convent, St. Anthonys Convent, Pushpadana Girls College and in recent times Seethadevi, Swarnamali, Hemamali, have taken up the game and produced good teams. There are many international schools too, playing the game especially Gateway who are doing well.
New Mayor Kessara to boost sports
The newly elected Mayor of Kandy Kessara Senanayake, should give a helping hand for sports.
At one time KMC gave a big hand for sports through the Playgrounds and community centres but today it is not up to the mark, with most of the community centres being closed and play grounds in a bad state. Every citizen of Kandy is expecting a lot from the new Mayor to give a helping hand for sports.

Healthcare for All
Sri Lanka is one of the few developing countries with a completely free health care system. This has paid dividends in the form of excellent health indices that are generally on par with those of the developed world. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO), organising their 70th annual World Health Day today (April 7) has highlighted Sri Lankas progress in the health sector on their WHD website and further honoured the country by having some of the main international WHD events in Colombo.
This years WHD theme is a familiar one for Sri Lanka: Universal Health Coverage (UHC): Everyone, Everywhere. This is exactly what Sri Lankan Governments have done since 1948. This does not mean that Sri Lanka is free of any health concerns  dengue is again rising for instance, but overall our heath system has accomplished a lot over the last 70 years.
But the WHO faces a huge challenge elsewhere. Half the world is currently lacking access to appropriate medical services. Another 100 million people have been forced into poverty from paying for medical bills or services. The WHO thus wants to see one billion more people gain access to healthcare services by 2023. This initiative starts on World Health Day today.
The WHO has showcased a success story from Sri Lanka to illustrate the benefits of UHC. According to the WHO: Sanath Kumara was only 16 when he had an accident and suffered severe injuries to his spinal cord. Sanath was treated in the Rheumatology and Rehabilitation Hospital in Ragama. The hospitals main goal is to optimize and maintain physical, sensory, intellectual, psychological and social functions. Patients receive care from a team of 350 professionals which include medical staff and speech, occupational and physiotherapists. As part of his therapy, the staff at the hospital encouraged Sanath to take part in para-athletic sports. All his emergency procedures, surgery and physiotherapy have been paid for by the Sri Lankan health system. Ragama, in which Sanaths hospital is located, provides services free at the point of delivery to people from all corners of the country.
UHC has been one of the main drivers of Sri Lankas remarkable health gains. Government policies have ensured easy access to medical services for the whole population, including in rural areas. With the support of the WHO, Sri Lanka is developing a Strategic Framework for Sustainable Development of Health and a Sustainable Health Financing Roadmap for Health. Both will help ensure and sustain equitable financing for health, including increased Government health spending. Free, comprehensive and continuous care is made available to the population by the State.
In President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Sri Lankans are fortunate to have three leaders who have shown a lifelong commitment to the free healthcare system. Under the guidance of the President and the Prime Minister, Dr. Senaratne has been instrumental in drastically reducing the prices of nearly 50 essential drugs, Intra Ocular Lenses and cardio stents. Cancer and kidney patients now receive lifelong free treatment. Sri Lanka also became the second country in the region to eradicate malaria and the countrys vaccination drive is regarded as a success. Sri Lankas very low infant mortality rate is on par with that of the US and ahead of other South Asian countries, which earned Sri Lanka a citation from the UN under the Every Child Alive initiative.
Several new hospitals are coming up including South Asias largest renal hospital in Polonnaruwa and existing hospitals are being expanded and renovated. Sri Lankas anti-tobacco drive has been so successful that cigarette consumption has gone down by an astonishing one billion sticks over the last three years. Very soon, Sri Lanka will become the first country in the world to fulfill all obligations of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) with the introduction of completely plain packaging and the restriction on loose cigarette sales.
Sri Lanka faces the challenge posed by illegal narcotics and liquor consumption which lead to a huge health cost. Moreover, as Sanath Kumaras story shows accidents have a hidden health cost - the State spends millions of rupees every year on treating crash victims. Sri Lanka also has a vibrant private healthcare sector, but this needs to be more tightly controlled as some of the fees are clearly outrageous. Proper standards must also be ensured at private hospitals vis--vis facilities and qualified personnel.
Sri Lanka  and the rest of the world  will have to spend more on healthcare in the coming years as the very success of modern medicines has led to a Silver Generation living well into their 80s and even the 90s. UHC is a lifeline for the elderly and the poor (who cannot anyway afford to go to a private hospital) and the State has an obligation to continue it. We should justifiably be proud of our acclaimed heath system, but the health sector trade unions must act with more responsibility as patients lives are at stake. A better dialogue and understanding between the authorities and TUs will further strengthen our health sector.

Jaffna High Court Judge M.Ilancheliyan had ordered to lower the sound of the loudspeaker of the Nayanmarkandu Kovil in Jaffna.
He admonished the kovil priest in court saying Gods hear better than humans. Several citizens of the city had filed a petition three weeks back against the kovil for its high levels of volume which disturbs the day to day activities of nearby citizens.
The petition states that students and patients of the nearby schools and hospitals suffer from the kovil loudspeaker's high volume.
The judge then ordered the Kovil priest to lower the volume and the Grama Sevakawas advised to produce a report on the outcome.The report stated that the volume hasnt been lowered as advised by court. Another petition was filed by the citizens and the kovil priest was summoned before the judge.

Mahanayake Theras proposal to President lauded
The Colombo Young Men's Buddhist Association (YMBA) yesterday praised the proposal of the Mahanayakes to President Maithripala Sirisena that it is high time to take measures to identify imposters, ordained as Buddhist monks, engaging in various nefarious activities being in the Buddhasasana and to take action to excommunicate them from the monkshood.
The association in a statement said that King Parakramabahu and King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe had taken action to preserve the purity of Buddhist monastic order by excommunicating those who behaved against the norms of the Monastic order.
Full statement:
Having received information to the effect that the Most Ven. Mahanayake Theras have addressed a memorandum to the President bringing to his notice that there has arisen an urgent need to identify those imposters, though ordained as Buddhist monks and are wearing yellow robes, are engaged in nefarious and irreligious activities violating the norms of Monastic Discipline, we hereby urge the President to take necessary action to excommunicate them from monkshood.
The Colombo Young Men's Buddhist Association wishes to take this opportunity to offer its appreciative veneration to the Venerable Mahanayake Theras for making this timely magnanimous proposal to the President.
Issuing Official and Authentic Identity Cards to traditionally ordained Bhikkus and female novices popularly known as Sil Mathas who are observing 10 Precepts is an urgent and essential requirement in Sri Lanka, which still retains the longstanding reputation as a country that preserves the pristine purity of the Theravada Buddhist tradition. It is known that the Venerable Mahanayake Theras representing the Three Nikayas have made reference to their Memorandum to historical facts that, subsequent to the establishment of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, King Parakramabahu the Great during the Polonnaruwa Period had taken action to excommunicate miscreant Bhikkus who behaved in violation of the norms of monastic discipline and King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe, during the Kandyan Period, had taken necessary action, in similar manner, to preserve the parity of the Buddhist Monastic Order and thereby strengthening the Buddhist Sasana in Sri Lanka.
While cherishing the earnest hope and expectation that this paramount important task aimed at safeguarding the security of the Venerable Maha Sangha who are performing a monumental service in preserving the sublime teachings of Buddha and the stability of Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka would receive the earliest attention of the President.
We take this opportunity to assure, with a feeling of utmost dedication towards Buddhism in Sri Lanka, the maximum support that the Colombo Young Men's Buddhist Association can extend towards successful accomplishment of this noble task whenever such support is deemed necessary.

## Title: MOVING AHEAD WITH NEW CONFIDENCE
## Supertitle:

MOVING AHEAD WITH NEW CONFIDENCE
How soon will it take for the county to move towards some stability in governance, after all the political diversions and digressions of the recent No-Confidence Motion This is the substance of the political debate today, having moved away from the immediate dangers of a success for the Joint Opposition ((JO)) and its supporters within the SLFP, especially in government. Now that a Prime Minister, challenged both by his political opponents and his own Cabinet colleagues, has won confidence in his office, the issues facing the government are how serious it could or would be in the coming months, in carrying out the policies it obtained a mandate from the people, both in January and August 2015.
The JO is thrust into a shaky situation. Not all the brouhaha of its strategists produced the results it proclaimed from political hilltops in the past few weeks, over the NCM against the Prime Minister. In fact, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, did far better than all of his opponents would have ever liked, and also showed that despite divisions on organisational issues within his own party, he had the support of its elected representatives in parliament, and was also able to draw the support of other parties both in government and opposition.
The events on the day of the NCM in parliament certainly showed major differences within the governing coalition of the UNP and SLFP, and the underlying weaknesses within the JO, which boasted of a huge victory in recent local government polls.
The JO did manage to increase the vote for the NCM from the 55 who had signed it to just 76 (with one signatory absent), but hardly sufficient to give meaning to its boasts of how the Prime Minister would be replaced after the vote on the NCM. It was certainly misled, or let down, by its allies in the government  the SLFP voices that have been against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe for some months, especially after the SLFPs resounding defeat in the local government polls.
The JO also had to face ignominy in its statements about more than 20 members of the UNP definitely voting against their party leader on the NCM. There certainly is a strong call for reform within the UNP, especially on issues of leadership and wider national policies; but these are not divisions that would support its rivals, such as those in the JO and SLPP, or even the SLFP. These were and remain inner-party divisions and the NCM vote showed the JO had totally misread them, and were misled by the party related statements of critics such as Palitha Range Bandara and Wasantha Senanayake.
The UNP will be active in the coming days and weeks paying attention to its inner-party issues, and is likely to emerge in a stronger position than both its government ally  the SLFP, and the Opposition JO in the coming months.
The SLFP issue
The NCM has certainly exposed much of the divisions within the SLFP that raises important questions on its capability on making a proper contribution to a government of unity in the coming months. The issue did begin months before the NCM was initiated and became the hot topic of politics. This went back to the campaign in the local government polls, when President Maithripala Sirisena, as leader of the SLFP and national president  threatened to use his sword against the forces of corruption, targeting both the Rajapaksa leadership of the former government and the UNP.
The huge win of the SLPP's Pohottuwa in the local government polls, pushing the UNP to a distant second place, and the SLFP/UPFA into a much further third place (12%) votes, certainly raised issues involving the role and function of the SLFP, under its present leadership, in the politics of Sri Lanka. The party which had been the biggest rival to the UNP since 1956, and has led several governments that defeated or kept out the UNP for several decades, is now facing a situation when its very existence is being questioned, which was clearly displayed by its members at the NCM.
The NCM itself was a hugely dividing situation, especially to the SLFP. The JO and its Mahinda Rajapaksa leadership was trying to get rid of Ranil Wickremesinghe and the UNP, and gain support from the SLFP led by President Sirisena for an anti-UNP, and hugely racist and majoritarian government to be led by the Rajapaksas. This echoed very well with many of the lead SLFP players within the Unity Government such as Susil Premajayantha, Nimal Siripala de Silva, SB Dissanayake, Dilan Perera and others in the ministerial ranks of the unity government, who saw benefits of an alliance with the JO and SLPP, especially considering future elections. The rolling out of the NCM also saw a major crisis of unity within the leadership of the Unity Government, with President Sirisena being compelled to make an unofficial and undeclared support for the NCM against the Prime Minister of his government and leader of the UNP, that was hugely responsible for the election of the Common Candidate Sirisena in the Presidential Poll of January 2015.
While the President took several measures to remove or reduce the powers or functions of the Prime Minister, such as by taking the Central Bank and Securities and Exchange Commission from the Prime Minister to the Finance Minister, and made no criticisms of the leading SLFP Cabinet and other ministers who were openly criticizing and opposed to the Prime Minister, showed a rising antagonism within the government; and at the vote on the NCM showed major differences within the SLFP.
Voting pattern
The voting itself showed the divisions within the SLFP. Very early in the day State Minister AHM Fowzie, said on record that the SLFP had decided to abstain from voting at the NCM.
Very soon after State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said the SLFP will support the NCM, and so confirmed by Dilan Perera. But at voting there were 17 members of the SLFP, who remain under the leadership of President Sirisena, were absent from the House. Those missing hold important Cabinet, and State and Deputy Minister positions, and also include the Secretary of the SLFP - Duminda Dissanayake and the Secretary of the UPFA  Mahinda Amaraweera.
There was also Provincial Council and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha, who was one of those very critical of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in the campaign for the NCM and Nimal Siripala de Silva, who brought the final message to Ranil Wickremesinghe to resign from office, and the oft tipped next SLFP PM. Were they following or ignoring a party call on the NCM voting
In the event the resounding parliamentary victory for Ranil Wickremesinghe in his 40th year in parliamentary politics, has in fact been an overwhelming setback to the SLFP, and raises many questions about its impact on electoral polls in the country. This will certainly lead to the SLPP needing to have a re-think about the ability of the SLFP, as it is structured and led today being of much benefit to it in future polls. This would certainly cause much worry for the SLFP members of the government who voted against Ranil Wickremesinghe in the NCM.
The politics ahead
Much of the politics ahead will have to do with the interpretation and functioning of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. It was clear that the Prime Minister could not be removed by the President under 19A. This is what really caused the NCM. But, there are also boasts by SLFP Ministers that they will remain in a future Cabinet, even though they voted against the PM in this NCM.
This has more to do with the principles of the persons involved than the constitutionality of their positions. However, there are several bigger issues that the government will have to face up to in the coming weeks.
These include the revival of the policies and pledges given to the people prior to the January 8, 2015 Presidential Poll. How serious could the government, under its present leadership be, about adopting a new constitution This is hardly likely, after having almost abandoned it in large measure in the past three years.
This could well move in a different direction, which would mean, limiting new changes to abolishing the Executive Presidency, and moving towards a Parliamentary Democracy with a Ceremonial President, Civil Society organisations that were involved in pushing the support for the Common Candidate in January 2015, are again looking at the possibility of how the current political situation and its limitations, could help in abolishing the Executive Presidency.
This could be the important stuff in future politics, which could also obtain the support of Mahinda Rajapaksa, who would wish to be a powerful prime minister, not having to be restricted by an Executive President. This could well be the key area of future political debate, apart from the crises of the SLFP and its leadership.

She said the majority of the incidents were reported from the Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara districts. Incidents of cruelty experienced by children in schools and within their homes were also included among the complaints. These complaints were reported to the NCPA through the hotline 1929. The NCPA has commenced speedy inquiries on these complaints with the NCPA Special Police Investigation Unit connecting with relevant police stations across the island. Some complaints were directed to the Labour Department as well, the statement said
The NCPA will work towards ensuring that the perpetrators will receive maximum punishments and conducting special awareness programmes centered around the entire society and schools to prevent such crimes from taking place in the future.
When children experience cruelty their entire personality gets destroyed.

Condolence votes on ex-MPs: House condoles late colleagues
Parliament yesterday took up the Votes of Condolence of ex-MPs late S Alavi Mowlana, K Velayudan, Suranimala Rajapaksa and U B Wijekoon.
The Condolence Motions were moved by Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa speaking on the Condolence Motion of Alevi Mowlana, admired the leadership he gave the Trade Union Movement.
Mowlana was a former CMC Councillor, MP, Minister and Western Province Governor. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the different political allegiances between Mowlana and him never turned into an issue to work together.
Former President Rajapaksa observed that there had been no TU movement at the Lipton roundabout or Hyde Park without Mowlana.
The PM speaking on the Condolence Motion of former Minister Suranimala Rajapaksa, said that he was a colleague who had been with him through thick and thin. We entered politics together and he was with me right from the start to his death.
Wickremesinghe recalled that he worked closely with ex-MP K Velayudan in solving the estate workers problems. He was not limited to Tamil politics, but represented all people in Badulla and a proud Sri Lankan, he said.
Speaking on the Condolence Motion on former Minister U B Wijekoon, the Premier said he worked tirelessly for the development of his electorate Dambadeniya. The two of us entered Parliament together and when I became the Kelaniya Organizer, he became the Dambadeniya Organizer. He supported the project of setting up of 200 garment factories and setting up of an Export Zone in Dambadeniya, he recalled.
A large number of MPs from both sides of the House joined in the Votes of Condolence on the four ex-MPs.
Alleged mixing of sugar in tea: Manufacturer to be probed:Naveen
Minister of Plantation Industries Navin Dissanayake, said that the alleged mixing of sugar with tea during the tea manufacturing process was being probed.
The Minister said this in response to a questioned raised by JVP MP Sunil Handunetti in Parliament yesterday.
Minister Dissanayake said that such illegal practises could have a severe impact on the image of Ceylon Tea, which had built a name for itself in the world market.
 A policy decision has to be taken on this matter and that he would take stern measures to stop such illegal practices, he said.
He said that around 80 factories were raided and tested whether sugar was mixed with tea, while the samples were sent to the Tea Research Institute (TRI), in Sri Lanka as well. He said that there was an issue whether there was natural sugar in the tea or it was being added by the factories. MP Hadunnetti said the manner in which factories were inspected was not up to standard, while the owners were very much disappointed about it.
MP Hadunnetti added that the Minister should look into the inspection process and emphasised that a proper system should be introduced to conduct an inspection on this matter, while Minister Dissanayake added that private tea factory owners had met him to discuss the above matter.
The Minister also agreed that there was an issue in the inspection process and added that he would not let the factory owners face any unfair treatment.
Minister Dissanayake said he will not implement the 2016 Budgetary proposal on lifting the restrictions on importation of tea for blending.
The Minister made the above observation in response to MP Bandula Gunawardenas question on measures to be taken by the Ministry on the above Budget proposal.
The Minister further said that no final decision had been taken on the above Budget proposal.
In terms of policy, the Ministry and the Tea Board had not so far agreed on this proposal, he said.
MP Gunawardena requested the Minister to submit a list which includes the amount of tea imported to Sri Lanka in the year 2016, according to the 2017 Budget proposal and the names of the ten main importers who import tea to Sri Lanka in each year during the period from the year 1977 up to 2016.
Minister Dissanayake in response, said that the Sri Lanka Tea Board, in the 1980s allowed the importation of tea to Sri Lanka.
Reports on Delimitation of Electorates in PCs: Special committee to be set up to sort out issues - Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said that a special Committee will be appointed to sort out the issues pertaining to the Report on the Delimitation of Electorates in Provincial Councils.
MP Alahapperuma said that the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local government Faiszer Mustapha, presented the Delimitation Committee Report for the Delimitation of Electorates in Provincial Councils on March 06.
He made this statement in response to question raised by MP Dullas Alahapperuma about the delimitation report on Provincial Councils. The Speaker said that the final decision on the report would be taken at a Party Leaders meeting.
According to the Act, within two weeks after the relevant subject Minister submits the report to Parliament, Parliament should hold a debate and get a two third majority approval. Failing to approve the report within a period of one month, the Speaker under the leadership of the Prime Minister, has to appoint a five member committee, he said.
Minister Lakshman Kiriella questioned MP Alahapperuma whether they would give a two third support MP Alahapperuma refrained from answering the question. MP Dullas Alahapperuma said postponing the debate on this matter was a violation of law, while the debate was supposed to be held on March 22, but was cancelled following a request by the government.
MP Alapperuma further said that the committee could not be appointed by ignoring the views of the MPs on the matter.
 According to the Constitution, Party leaders have no authority to take a decision on this matter and that it was clearly mentioned in the Act, he said.

To increase age limit of criminal responsibility from 8 to 12 years: Govt. presents two Bills to amend Penal Code of Criminal Procedure
The Government yesterday in Parliament, presented two Bills to amend the Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure to increase the age limit of criminal responsibility from 8 to 12 years.
The Bills were presented for the first reading by Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake.
According to the Penal Code Amendment Bill, the age limit of 8 years under which no act of a child is considered an offence has been increased to 12 years.
Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under 12 years of age. Nothing is an offence which is done by a child above twelve years of age and under fourteen, if the judge is of the opinion that he has not attained sufficient maturity to understand the nature and consequences of his act, the Bill stated.
If a child, who committed the offence, is between 12 and 14 years of age, law enforcement authorities must consult the discretion of a Magistrate to determine whether the child had the required degree of maturity to commit an offence.
In order to facilitate this revision of law, the Government last Friday, also Gazetted an Amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure to inserts a new section to enable the officer in charge of a Police station to direct a child between 12 and 14, alleged to have committed an offence, be examined by a Government Medical Officer or other experts in the relevant field in order to assist the Magistrate to form his opinion on the maturity of understanding of such child. It must be done with the consent of the parent or guardian of the child.
The move to increase the minimum age of criminal responsibility was taken up after considering the opinion of Psychologists and other experts on the subject. Government authorities said the expert view of Psychologists and other specialists is that the current minimum age of 8 years is too young to be subjected to criminal responsibility.
Excess staff of ministers, severe loss to Govt. coffers
MP Bimal Ratnayake said though the number of ministers have been decreased, the government would suffer the same expenditure due to ministers maintaining several private staff.
He further said that the President and the Prime Minister are deliberately violating the Constitution in this regard.
A Minister could hold more than one portfolio, but that does not mean that they need two or three private staff members. Though the number of ministers had been decreased in terms of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, each minister has been provided with several portfolios. Those ministers keep several private staff members, while there is no decrease in government expenditure in maintaining ministers, he said.
He noted that the circular issued by the President in this regard, clearly states that the number of staff members in the private office of a minister could not exceed 15 persons.
Even though the government claims that there are only 93 ministers. When we look at the matter in terms of state finance, public funds are spent on more than 100 to 150 ministers considering the amount of private staff members each minister has, he said.
He questioned Minister Mahinda Amaraweera who is at present the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development and State Minister of Mahaweli Development to inform Parliament about his private staff and whether he has two separate staff members for his ministries.
Minister Amaraweera responded by saying that there are 21 persons working as his private staff at the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development and added that there is a separate staff at the Ministry of Mahaweli Development as well.
He further said that he had not violated the circular issued by the President on the number of staff in the private office of a minister.
SLMC MPs receiving Rs. 250 million to vote against PMs NCM: Deputy Minister Cassim requests Speaker to probe fabricated website story
Deputy Minister Faizal Cassim yesterday raising a privilege matter in Parliament, asked the Speaker to inquire in to the fabricated story of Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) MPs receiving Rs 250 million to vote against the No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister.
He said this fabricated story appeared on a news website operated by former Minister Dr Wijayadasa Rajapakshes son Rakitha Rajapakshe.
He denied this allegation as totally untrue. He asked the Speaker to inquire into the matter and take action against the persons responsible for the spread of this fabricated story, which was done on purpose to tarnish the good name of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as well as the SLMC.

The march against cancer organised by the Fight Cancer Trust was held on April 1 with the participation of 3,500 volunteers. The PET scan machine was vested with the public at the Maharagama cancer hospital by Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne.
The PET scan machine had been donated to the Maharagama Cancer hospital at a cost of Rs.250 million where the donations were made by the citizens of the country over three months. This is also the first time that a march against cancer was held in Sri Lanka. The funds collected during the march would be used to buy more equipment for the PET scan machine. The tri forces along with the Police and the STF also took part in this event.
The march was a success and everything went smoothly.We are planning to perform free bypasses for the poor as our next project titled Heart to Heart with Dr.Ruwan Ekanayake and Dr. Rajitha De Silva, experts in the field. Usually patients have to wait for about a year on the waiting list in Government hospitals and we plan to accelerate the process. We also urge the public to help in our upcoming projects, an organiser said.

Peterites have slight edge over Isipathana today
High riding St.Peters College Bambalapitiya will have a slight edge over unpredictable Isipathana College in their Singer A Division inter school league rugby tournament match to be played at Havelock Park today at 4:15pm.
The St.Peters lads under the leadership of Javed Zarook have an immaculate record in this years ongoing league tournament where they are yet to lose a game being unbeaten.
They have won all their games thus far by beating Zahira College Maradana (48-12), Wesley College (33-17) and Dharmaraja College Kandy (42-05). St.Peters cause has been severely bolstered by the presence of their ever reliable forwards who have carried out a sensational display this season together with their whole eight dominating the set pieces and having abundance of ball position through line outs, rucks and mauls. spear headed by cracking number eight cum captain Zarook and second row forward Nizran Nillar.
Along with their speedy three quarter line with the help of play makers Jason Karunarathna centres Raveen Fernando(who is doubtful for todays game due to nursing an ankle injury) and Sandesh De Mel are scoring try after try through their famous three quarter moves. Also they have a reliable place kicker and his contribution in this match with his kicking boot will be highly vital for a Peterite victory.
On the other hand Isipathana College possesses a good team also being unbeaten with play maker and captain Manelka Ruberu along with their entire three quarter line can play an outstanding game to bring victory to their school but has been blowing hot and cold and is feeling the sting of the nail biting win they had against D.S.Senanayake College Colombo where they won by a whisker by (25-24) due to DSS missing the easy conversion in the final minute in their first game for the season.
In their other matches they recorded victories against Dharmaraja College Kandy (42-14) and Zahira College Maradana by 17 points to 7.
Mean while this will be a do or die battle for Isipathana College and if they lose this battle to St.Peters College today in this match, then it could be worse for them as they will slip down to second place behind Peters in the rankings.

President tells all parties:
Priority for development work
President Maithripala Sirisena, yesterday, invited all parties represented in Parliament to join hands with the government to forge ahead in the realization of good governance.
Priority now, should be given to development strategies for the benefit of the country, he said.
The President made this statement addressing the heads of media institutes at the Presidents House in Colombo.
Expediting development work is the foremost in our agenda, said the President, adding that the Local Government elections, Kandy incidents and the No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister affected the development work undertaken by the government to a certain extent.
The current topic in and out of the government is the No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister. Many views were expressed and I too was made a defendant in the NCM by one party, while others said they did not receive any support from me. All these led to some confusion, the President said.
Answering several questions relating to the No-Confidence Motion, the President denied any kind of involvement in it. The President also referred to the crisis within the UNP which resulted in the No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister.
There were groups within the UNP that worked against the Premier. Those and other groups against the Premier joined together, he said.
Admitting that UNP groups met him thrice, the President said that they were certain of their majority in Parliament.
My position was that they should adhere to the provisions of the Constitution and any move should be within the Constitutional framework of the country.
The President, thereafter, said that in spite of what happened in Parliament, he was responsible for the people.
In the wake of the post-NCM scenario, the President still believes in the importance of the unity government and invited all parties to join them.
In my view, it should be a unity government and no single party can form a government, he said.
Answering a question from the participants as to whether he had a role in the No-Confidence Motion sponsored by Mahinda Rajapaksa-led JO that dented the confidence of the Tamils in the President, the President said that the question was not clear, but denied any involvement in the process.
The President also denied that there was any pressure from the international community. Responding to another question, he said that he never received a letter purported to have been signed by some UNP members demanding the removal of SLFP ministers who voted for the NCM. I am yet to receive such a letter, the President said.
In any case, the President said, the SLFP Central Committee would meet next week to decide on a course of action.
Referring to the recently concluded Local Government elections, the President said no political party could obtain over 40% of the total vote.
Most of the election figures that were published in the media fell short of the truth. Some political analysts made an attempt to draw a dismal picture by trying to draw parallels and adapt it to a national election scenario, the President said.
The SLFP affiliated parties contested on four symbols; the hand, horse, betel leaf and cock. The total polled for the SLFP alliance is about 15 percent of the total vote. In a national election, the SLFP would have secured about 30 seats while the Lotus Bud would have won 102 seats. Nobody could form a government under these circumstances. This is the reality and the political fallout of the election results, although they spoke of an overwhelming success, which is far from reality.
The President, referring to the current political scenario, said that out of the 41 SLFP MPs in the government, some wanted to quit the government in December and this demand came to a head with the election results. When this was discussed in December, the SLFP decided to wait until the Local Government elections were over.
The President, thereafter, said: In spite of what happened in Parliament, I am responsible for the people.
In my view, it should be a unity government and no single party can form a government, he said.

Royal breaks the hearts of Joes with 18-13 win
Unbeaten Royal College broke the heart of St.Josephs College Maradana when they pulled off a hard fought 18 points (2 tries, 1 conversion, 2 penalties) to 13 (1 try, 1 conversion, 2 penalties) victory in their Singer A Division inter-schools league rugby tournament first round game played at Havelock Park yesterday. At half time Royal led 10-7.
Royal forwards fought like terriers in the whole match combining effectively with their three quarters giving no room for their opponents winning all the line outs through Fadhil Adahan. St.Josephs finally collapsed to the relentless pressure from the entire Royal outfit.
Joes scored in the very first minute of the game and went into a 7-nil lead when winger Dulanjana Piyatissa outfoxed and went through the Royal defence, where he finally drew the final defender and sent his full back Tharindu Maduranga over to score a try with a peach of an offload.

SLPP councillors clash for Chilaw PS chair
A tense situation erupted in Chilaw when two councillors of the Chilaw Pradeshiya Sabha representing the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) arrived at the Pradeshiya Sabha to assume office yesterday. The SLPP secured power in the Chilaw Pradeshiya Sabha and had appointed Sarath De Silva as the chairman and Eric Samson as the vice chairman.
However, Sunil Paaris and Janitha Devapriya who had obtained the highest percentage in terms of preferential votes at the recently concluded Local Government election had arrived at the Pradeshiya Sabha premises before the new chairmans arrival and assumed duties by hoisting the national flag.
Sunil Paaris forcibly entered the PS Chairmans room and attempted to place a note on the Log book when police entered the scene.Police officials told him to leave the chairmans office to pave the way for the new chairman Sarath De Silva to assume duties.
a tense situation emerged as Sarath Silva arrived at the Pradeshiya Sabha and Madampe Police was compelled to call in additional police officials to control the situation.
Afterwards, the duly elected chairman of the Podujana Peramuna had rehoisted the national flag again. The ceremony had taken more than one and half hours and the supporters of Sunil Paaris protested creating an ugly scene.
We are protesting because the party did not appoint the candidates who secured the highest per centage of preferential votes at the elections. They appointed candidates with low percentage in terms of preferential votes as the chairman.\The SLFP and UNP candidates did not attend this ceremony to support us.The leaders of the party should rectify this issue soon, said Sunil Paaris.
The chairman of the council Sarath Silva stated that he condemns the actions of a few and he will serve the people to the best of his abilities.
The party had done a mistake when electing the chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha and discussions will be conducted to solve this issue, said former minister Piyankara Jayaratne.
This issue has emerged as a result of the new electoral system. A discussion will be held with the leaders of the party and the candidates, Puttalam District MP Arundika Fernando said.

Social media must be regulated: President
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday stressed the need to regulate social media to avert anti-social activities in the country.
The President was addressing the heads of media institutes at the Presidents House in Colombo yesterday.
Stating that some activities in social media are harmful to the peaceful coexistence of the nation, he reiterated the need to have control over it to stop the spread of hatred among communities.
Referring to the Kandy incidents, he said that the involvement of teenagers disturbed many. He said, therefore, it was important to regulate Facebook and other social media tools to keep society in check.
Parents were pleased when we banned Facebook for a short period. However, we cannot do it for long. We also held discussions with Facebook authorities over the incriminating material published on social media and their ready answer was that there were no human resources to monitor Sri Lankan languages, the President said.
They will visit Sri Lanka again. Problems in Europe and elsewhere forced them to put off the Sri Lankan visit, he said, adding that he would certainly encourage them to set up an office in Colombo to thwart incriminating material being published in social media platforms.

Speaker informs House about Thilangas resignation
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday informed Parliament that Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala had tendered his resignation to President Maithripala Sirisena about a month ago.
He told the House that Sumathipala, who met him nearly a month ago, informed him that he wished to refrain from involving in duties attached to the Deputy Speaker post as he wants to actively take part in political activities.
He told me that he would not be assuming the Chair because it was not proper for him to engage in active politics and simultaneously work in the Deputy Speakers post. It was his voluntary decision and I respect him for doing so, he said.
The Speaker made this observation when MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena questioned as to why Deputy Speaker Sumathipala does not preside the House when the Speaker leaves the Chamber.
We did not see him coming to the Chair this whole week. It is a serious problem, if you are denying him of that opportunity, he stated. Following the reply of the Speaker, MP Gunawardena said if there is such a resignation letter, the Speaker must read it aloud in Parliament.
The Speaker said Sumathipala had only sent the letter to the President and not to him.

Alleged incident between Thilanga and Navin:
Speaker promises impartial inquiry
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday promised to hold an impartial inquiry into the incident involving Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala and Minister Navin Dissanayake in Parliament on Wednesday night.
The Deputy Speaker on Thursday wrote to the Speaker complaining that Minister Navin Dissanayake had threatened him near the elevator on the Second Floor when he was leaving Parliament after voting in favour of the No-Confidence Motion. He had also lodged a Police complaint in that regard.
MP Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday brought the attention of the House to this letter.
As MPs of this Parliament, we have a responsibility to see that the Deputy Speaker can discharge his duties freely. It is needed for the smooth functioning of Parliament. If he is faced with death threats, it is a serious matter, he commented.
Minister Dissanayake pledged his full support for the Speaker to hold an impartial inquiry into the incident.
I will be also sending a letter to you explaining as to what had actually happened. Then you conduct an impartial inquiry and finding out the truth. The incident was captured on CCTV and was also witnessed by two Police personnel. I can also lodge a Police complaint, he said.
This is my 18th year in Parliament and in all these years, I have never insulted any Member of Parliament. I have never acted in a manner that spoiled my good name or self-respect. I hail from a respectable family. It was pathetic that MP Gunawardena, knowing that I never behave in such a manner, made those unfounded allegations, Minister Dissanayake said.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said Sumathipala had acted in a partial manner without giving due respect to his Deputy Speaker post.
I pointed this out at a Party Leaders Meeting previously. He took part in an SLFP press conference where the Prime Minister was criticised.
He misinterpreted the Standing Orders when he said that a Secret Vote could be taken for an No Confidence Motion.
What he said was totally wrong as secret votes could only be taken when electing the Speaker and when Parliament has to appoint a President, he said.

Three times the entire team received the Man of the Match award
Cricket, despite being a team game, individual players exert a much bigger influence on the outcome of a contest in comparison to other sports.
When a bowler runs into bowl at the batsman, it is a battle between two players and the result in a cricket match is decided by a series of such contests.
Thus, the Man-of-the-Match award in cricket is generally given to the player who has played the most significant part individually in his teams performance on the day.
Mostly given to a player from the winning side, there have been many instances when a player from the losing team has also bagged the award.
However, instances when the whole team was awarded the Man-of-the-Match award in cricket, have been few and far between. In fact, it has happened only thrice in international crickets 142-year long history - once in Tests and twice in ODIs.
The decision doesnt necessarily mean that all the eleven players in the side played a major role in the teams victory per se, but keeping statistics aside, it is a token of appreciation for the part they part in a collective win.
Lets have a look at the circumstances that led to such a decision being taken by the adjudicators in detail.
4TH ODI, NEW ZEALAND TOUR OF
WEST INDIES AT GEORGETOWN, APRIL 3, 1996
Match Summary: New Zealand 158 all out (35.6 overs) beat West Indies 154 all out (49.1 overs) by 4 runs
The first instance in international cricket when the whole team was awarded the Man-of-the-Match was in April 1996 when the victorious New Zealand team bagged the honour for their collective effort in a thrilling 4-run win over West Indies at Georgetown.
Heading into the 4th ODI of the five-match series trailing 2-1, the visitors knew that they had to win to remain alive in the contest and they did just that, albeit after a big scare.
Things werent looking good for the Black Caps halfway through the game, as they were dismissed for 158 after being put into bat by West Indian skipper Courtney Walsh.
Craig Spearman was the top-scorer with 41 with only skipper Lee Germon, Nathan Astle and Chris Cairns managing to reach double-figures for the Kiwis in addition to the former.
With the New Zealand innings winding up within 36 overs, there was still time for the West Indies batsmen to start their run-chase but it didnt go the way the home crowd were hoping for.
Gavin Larsen provided the early breakthroughs the New Zealanders were desperately craving for, getting rid of Stuart Williams and the dangerous Brian Lara who was looking in ominous form, hitting Dipak Patel for three consecutive boundaries.
With West Indies struggling at 39/3, New Zealand knew that they could defend their low-total and continued to exert their stranglehold on proceedings in the post-lunch session as well.
The bowlers gave little away with their line and length and kept picking up wickets at regular intervals, with Phil Simmons the fourth to go after a 29-run stand for the 4th wicket.
Jimmy Adams and Roland Holder added 36 runs for the 5th wicket and were threatening to take the game away from the opposition when Chris Harris ran out the former for 11. While Holder managed to keep his wicket intact, wickets kept falling in a flurry at the other end, as West Indies were reduced from 104/4 to 120/8.
Curtly Ambrose and Holder added 32 runs for the ninth wicket and were just 7 runs away from winning the series for their side when the former fell to Justin Vaughan and Walshs dismissal in the final over by Chris Cairns left Holder stranded at one end on 49, thereby giving the Kiwis a memorable win.
3RD ODI, PAKISTAN TOUR OF ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND, AT NOTTINGHAM, SEPTEMBER 1, 1996
Match Summary: England 246 all out in 50 overs lost to Pakistan 247/8 in 49.4 overs
Togetherness may not be one of Pakistan cricket teams biggest strengths, but they are the only side apart from New Zealand to have collected a Team Man-of-the-Award in ODI cricket.
The match in question was the 3rd and final ODI of the three-match series against England in 1996 when they put in a spirited performance to claim a consolation win having lost the first two matches.
Nick Knight might have reasons to feel aggrieved as his unbeaten knock of 125, where he carried the bat for the hosts after opening the innings, was overlooked after Pakistan clinched a thrilling 2-wicket win with two balls remaining.
Electing to bat first after winning the toss, England lost Alec Stewarts wicket early on, caught and bowled by Wasim Akram.
The hosts managed to put up a few partnerships with Knight being the cornerstone and despite Englands next highest-scorer after Knight being 30 by skipper Michael Atherton, they managed to post 246 runs on the board in their 50 overs.
Akram was the leading wicket-taker for Pakistan with 3 scalps while Waqar Younis, Shahid Nazir, and Saqlain Mushtaq bagged a couple each. The visitors started off brightly in their run chase with Shahid Anwar and Saeed Anwar putting on a quick-fire 93-run stand for the opening wicket before the former was dismissed for 37 in what was his first and only ODI. Saeed Anwar fell for 61 with the Pakistan scoreboard reading 114/2 and it was followed by a 63-run stand for the third wicket between Amir Sohail and Ijaz Ahmed.
Sohails dismissal for 29 however triggered a mini-collapse as Pakistan were reduced from 177/2 to 199/6. The fall of wickets also had an effect on the required run-rate as it crept up to the 6-runs-per-over mark to put the visitors in a tight spot.
Ijaz Ahmed fell for 59 with the target still 28 runs away but wicketkeeper-batsman Rashid Latif kept his cool with a 28-ball 31 to help his side clinch victory by 2 wickets with two balls remaining.
5TH TEST, WEST INDIES TOUR OF SOUTH AFRICA AT CENTURION, JANUARY 15-18 1999
Match Summary:
Result: South Africa won by 351 runs
The only instance of all eleven players from a side sharing the Man of the Match award in Test cricket happened in 1999 when the South African team were bestowed with the honour following their 351-run against West Indies at Centurion in January 1999 that helped the hosts complete a 5-0 series whitewash.
It was a tour to forget for the Carribean side and the 351-run loss at Centurion was their biggest defeat until that time in Test cricket in terms of margin of runs.
It started off brilliantly for the visitors as they reduced the Proteas to 18/3 after winning the toss and electing to field first.
Things only went downhill from that point on for Brian Laras side though as a century by Mark Boucher and a knock of 83 by Jacques Kallis helped the hosts score 313 runs in their first innings with Courtney Walsh picking up 6 wickets for his side.
In reply, only Lara, who top-scored with a 77-ball 68 and Shivnarine Chanderpaul who scored 38, managed to reach double-figures as West Indies were bowled out for just 144, giving the hosts a 169-run first innings lead.
Allan Donald led the rout with a five-wicket haul while Shaun Pollock and Lance Klusener bagged a couple each. Kallis also got into the act, picking up the final wicket to fall.
The Proteas continued their dominance over the hapless opposition in the second innings as well as centuries from Gary Kirsten and Jonty Rhodes propelled them to 399/5 before skipper Hansie Cronje declared the innings, setting West Indies a target of 569 runs. Though the visitors fared better second time around, it was never going to be enough as they were bundled out for 217 with Ridley Jacobs top-scoring with 78 runs.
For South Africa, Paul Adams took four second-innings wickets after failing to get to bowl a single delivery in the first innings. Kallis, who won the Player-of-the-Series award, bagged a couple while even Darryl Cullinan also managed to pick up a wicket, getting rid of tailender Mervyn Dillon. - SK

Top instances of players being led into blunders by their captains
For long, Cricket has been termed as the Gentlemen's game and cricketers are among the most respected athletes in the world. Even some players have gone on to have the stature of Gods.
Over the years, Cricket has seen some extraordinary players who have led their team with a lot of pride. Captains like Steve Waugh, Sourav Ganguly, Imran Khan and Nasser Hussain always led from the front of setting benchmarks.
However, there have been few instances of captains making their players do unfortunate things and bringing disrepute to the game. Let us have a look at such incidents that shocked the cricket fraternity.

The government has made a special arrangement to provide Rs. 400,000 to buy a land and Rs 800,000 to construct a house for each extended family living in Jaffna welfare centers during so many years.
The troops serving in the Jaffna peninsula provided assistance to those who received grants from the government to construct their houses in the Thelippalei area. The assistance by troops gave a great relief to the families to save their money and spend on purchasing building materials.
MP Mavai Senathirajha handed over the houses to the families on April 5. Commander of the Army Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake handed over 25 houses constructed by the Army at the Keeramalei area to resettle the displaced persons on March 30.

Ranil remains Champion:
Unaffected, unchallenged, and confident
The no-faith motion, which proved to be nothing but a damp squib despite the media feeding frenzies for two full weeks, has however opened up the political space to bring in the much needed structural and policy reforms to the Government, giving it yet another chance to stay the course.
The need to grasp this opportunity from both the hands were expressed by many a members in the United National Front for Good Governance during the debate of No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against the Prime Minister.
The 12-hour marathon debate was well-attended by the members of both sides, unlike the many present-day Parliamentary debates, where the member on his feet speaks mostly to empty chairs. Yet it failed to bring the excitement it promised because the political developments in the eve of the motion and the morning next day made it certain that the Premier has got no real challenge.
UNF closed ranks
The Government, to be more specific the UNF camp, was able to turn the tables on the sponsors of the motion and prove it to be a flop right from the start. The NCM presented by the Joint Opposition backfired on them as it made public the fissures in his own group, whereas Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe turned it around as a Confidence Motion for him and his Government to emerge stronger.
The biggest achievement for the UNP was that it could face the NCM as one bloc despite the heightened intra-party issues following the unexpected set back at the Local Government polls two months ago. The JO could not even rope in the support of UNP dissident MP and former Justice Minister Dr. Wijayedasa Rajapakshe, who broke ranks with the Government in August last year.
UNP MPs Palitha Range Bandara and Wasantha Senanayake, who were openly critical of the party leadership, also tamely toed the party line and rendered their support to defeat the NCM.
Taking the wind out of JO's sails, the duo went public with their decision at a press conference convened on the day of the debate.
The minority parties allied with the UNF including the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) led by Minister Rauf Hakeem, All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) led by Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, and Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) led by Mano Ganesan collectively threw their weight behind the Prime Minister. It must be noted that the vote of those minority parties along with the 16 votes of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) led by R Sampanthan played a key role in deciding which side would get the simple majority of 113 votes.
You can't have your cake and eat it
To say it in plain, it was the SLFP which suffered the biggest blow from the NCM. The SLFP group in the Government was split down the middle with one faction supporting the no-faith motion and the other faction choosing to be absent for the vote. The SLFP members in the Government ranks were unable to take a collective decision on the vote of NCM even after having a series of meetings, some even chaired by their party leader President Maithripala Sirisena. With the SLFP MPs in the Joint Opposition, the SLFP has now splintered into three factions, driving the party into further crisis.
The UNP members, especially the backbenchers, who have been weary of the uneasy political marriage with the SLFP, were quick to demand the purge of all SLFP ministers and deputy ministers who voted in favour. UNP State Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva, taking the floor after Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara, said in no certain terms that the SLFP MPs, who choose to vote against the Government and the Prime Minister, should immediately leave the Government.
Voting in favour of this motion means that you are against the Government of which you are also a part of. It is highly unethical for you to continue to stay in the Government after doing so. If you are a minister with a backbone, the right thing to do is to cross over to the Opposition benches. You cannot have the cake and eat it too, he told Minister Jayasekara.
JO lukewarm about NCM
JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake, joining in the debate, stated that the biggest betrayal of the peoples mandate was from President Sirisena. He directly said that the President was behind the NCM against the PM and that it was presented with the support of a few JO MPs in Gota Kalliya.
He accused the Joint Opposition of not showing real interest in succeeding the NCM. Pointing at the poor attendance of JO, which was less than 20 in number at the time of moving the motion, MP Rathnayake went on to say that the JOs interest in defeating the NCM was even lesser than their interest in securing the ruling power of a local council. He charged that this lacklustre attitude was due to political deals between Premier Wickremesinghe and former President Rajapaksa.
JO firebrand Dinesh Gunawardena too did not have his shrill voice when presenting the motion on behalf of his group. He however largely criticized the Government for not taking prompt action against the Central Bank bond issues and for letting former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran to leave the country. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made a brief appearance in the chamber as the motion against him was being moved.
Minister Susil Premajayantha, stole the limelight of the debate, with a tirade against Government for about half an hour. He received cheers of the Joint Opposition MPs and jeers of the UNP backbenchers as he spoke. He was critical of the Presidents act of removing him from the post of General Secretary of the UPFA with few days to go for the Parliamentary Elections in 2015.
He went on to say that the day the SLFP old hands such as Nimal Siripala de Silva, John Seneviratne, Anura Yapa, Dilan Perera and himself pull out of the SLFP, there would not be a National Government. He took pains to say that he has no craving for positions and has no ill-gotten money or property. As Premajayantha vented his anger and frustration in a broadside at the Government, many expected an imminent cross over following his speech. However, this did not happen even after the vote where 16 of SLFP ministers and deputy ministers including Premajayantha voted in favour of the motion.
NCM done and dusted
The debate reached its climax as Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, a frontline member of the UNF and one of the first few to defect the Rajapaksa administration to rally around the cause of good governance, made the winding up speech on behalf of the Government. The minister, who brought in a bundle of FCID and CID files and the 34 PRECIFAC reports, fired salvos at the JO by detailing on a number of high profile cases and myriad of charges against JO MPs and close associates and family members of former President Rajapaksa. He vowed that these cases would be expedited in the coming days and that the culprits would be prosecuted before long.
The public gallery was filled to capacity and the Government and Opposition benches were mostly filled as Premier Wickremesinghe walked into the main chamber at 9 pm, half an hour ahead of the Vote of No-Confidence.
Concluding a marathon debate, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya announced the final results at 10 pm after taking the vote by name. The House negatived the NCM with a majority of 46 votes, thus reinforcing the confidence on the PM. The NCM was done and dusted with 122 votes against and 76 votes in favour ending 14 days of number game in Parliament.
Former President Rajapaksa turned up for the vote finally as the quorum bell went off and voted for the motion along with his brother Chamal and son Namal. He left the chamber before the final results were announced.
Having won the vote, jubilant PM thanked his group at a committee room in Parliament, and then the celebrations began for the Grand Old Party with some colourful firework near the Parliament complex.
Two signatories to NCM among absentees
The SLFP members, who voted in favour of the motion, included Parliamentarians Susil Premajayantha, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Dilan Perera, John Seneviratne, Lakshman Wasantha Perera, Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Tharanath Basnayake, Susantha Punchinilame, Anura Yapa, S. B. Dissanayake, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Chandima Weerakkody, Anuradha Jayaratne, Sumedha Jayasena, T. B. Ekanayake and Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala.
Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva did not turn up during the vote but the SLFP group who supported the motion said he was also on the same page with them. The JVP voted in favour keeping to its word, while the TNA en bloc voted against.
A total of 26 MPs were absent. Among them were 23 SLFP members including UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera and SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake. Ven. Athuraliye Rathana thera was also absent. Notably, two SLFP MPs who signed the motion, Kader Masthan and Nishantha Muthuhettigama, were also not present.
This was the 47th NCM in the Sri Lankan Parliament history and the third against a Prime Minister. Previously, two NCMs had been submitted and taken for vote against former PMs late SWRD Bandaranaike in 1957 and late Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1975. Those two motions had also been defeated with a comfortable margin.

Vast sums spent on pro-poor health policies - Minister
Salaries of health workers will cross Rs. 52,000 a month by January 2020, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He said now people have forgotten the Rs.10,000 salary increase they received in 2015 from the government. He was addressing the gathering after handing over appointment letters to 350 MLTs and health professionals in eight other grades during a ceremony held at the BMICH in Colombo yesterday evening.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that even health officials think about everything in rupee terms as trained by the previous regime.During that time cancer patients died when they reached the limit for state sponsored funds allocated for their drugs.But there is no limit for funds allocated for cancer patients' drugs now.
Minister Senaratne also pointed out that the previous regime allocated only Rs.1,300 million for cancer drugs but this Government spends Rs 4,800 million for them.In the past only 50 to 60 stents were put for heart patients in the state hospitals but now it has increased up to 450 to 500 due to the free stents given to patients by the Government.Earlier five out of every six heart patients died without being able to buy stents, but today only one out of six of such heart patients die, he said.

Warning against watery graves
Taking crazy risks to get a thrill from courting danger can end in tears more often, and those who are involved in disaster management have often drawn public attention to the fact.
In order to avoid watery graves in the Mahaweli canal of Viyana Ela, the Disaster Management Ministry has set up warning signs against drowning in the canal connecting the Diyabana Oya reservoir to the creek of Ulhitiyava Oya, both of which are in the Mahiyanganaya area.
Accidents have occurred in the Mahaweli canal which had claimed many lives for the past two decades.

Water from Yan Oya Project for 20,000 acres by mid 2020
Water will be released to nearly 20,000 acres of paddy fields under the Yan Oya reservoir in mid 2020 following the filling of the reservoir.
Delay in resettling evacuated families under the Yan Oya reservoir resulted in postponing filling of the reservoir for nearly one year.
Project Director Engineer Udaya Hemakumara told Daily News that the Yan Oya river is the main water source for feeding the Yan oya reservoir.
The main dam across the river is about three km long. Its construction work commenced in 2014 and 95 percent of head work was completed by the Chinese CAMC Company in 2017 except filling the river mouth. Recently, filling this part was commenced and once the task is over, the main dam will be fully complete, Hemakumara said.
Constructing the south bank main canal was carried out by the Irrigation Department. Its length is about 12 kms. The left bank main canal runs about 20 kms. It gets water from the Yan Oya reservoir at eight cubic meters of water per second.
About 20 small tanks by the two canals provide irrigational water to medium scale tanks including Jayanthiwewa, Huruluwewa, and D8 tank among others.
"The Chinese CAMC Engineering Company built the reservoir's main dam and it also carries out head works of South bank main canals. The project costs Rs. 65,000 million.
Several dilapidated tanks along the canal banks will be renovated too under the project.
Hemakumara said test filling of the reservoir will begin in the year end during the monsoon rains. As water is released, 250 acres of paddy land at the Maha Sorowwa (Main sluice) will get water from the reservoir.
The Project Director said the constriction work would end by mid 2020 and water will be released via the two canals for 2,000 acres of paddy fields. "We will accelerate resettlement programme. It got delayed due to many reasons. Interviews are now held to pay compensation for the evacuated families. They will be provided with "Ahimi Kanna Wandi" for 2017/18 Maha season - Rs. 35,000 per acre," he said.

Four injured in Trinco:
Wildlife officers shoot bear
Three persons were seriously injured and another sustained minor injuries following a bear attack in Thambalagamuwa in Trincomalee yesterday.
The bear had entered a colony and had caused injuries to four people and the wildlife officials had to be called. The bear had died when a firearm had gone off when wildlife officials grappled to control the animal.
We entered the village and searched for the bear.
The bear then jumped onto the vehicle and began attacking the windscreen. The driver reversed the vehicle and the bear fell but climbed back again from the rear and began attacking us. We tried to control the bear and while doing so a firearm went off. The bear was wounded near his eye and we rushed the bear to the Girithale veterinarian office but it died within sight of the office, Wildlife Assistant D.M Siriwardene said.
Veterinarian Dr.Sameera Palinguarachchi suspected the bear was suffering from rabies after the post-mortem examination. The carcass was sent to the Peradeniya veterinary faculty for further examination.
Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama had informed authorities to conduct an investigation of the shooting.

Alliance Finance boosts for top two athletes
In furtherance of its commitment of building a dynamic nation, Alliance Finance is sponsoring two promising young athletes who are representing Sri Lanka at the Commonwealth Games that is on right now.
The sporting careers of 22-year- old badminton star Sachin Dias and 18-year- old swimming sensation Akalanka Peiris are being supported by this well respected finance company. They are now in Gold Coast, Australia for the 21 st edition of the Commonwealth Games. Both have expressed their deep gratitude for the backing they are receiving.
Sachin is now one of Sri Lankas top sportsmen. But it will not be an easy task to compete against the likes of Indian, Malaysian and English players. Sri Lanka is yet to clinch a medal in badminton outside South Asia and to win one would require an extraordinary effort.
But Sachin has been through strenuous training and vows to give it his best shot. He admits that he could not have overcome personal difficulties without the assistance of Alliance Finance, which took him under its wings in 2013. Born to a family of modest means, his parents made considerable sacrifice to help him climb to the top ranks of the local badminton scene.
Today, he counts among his international medals, silver and a bronze from the last South Asian Games and the first bronze medal to Sri Lanka from the Youth Olympic Games held in China in 2014. In keeping with the social impact and value system at Alliance, his future and career goals have also been carefully thought of through a grooming program where he will be guaranteed employment at Alliance.
Akalanka was just three when his father helped him into the water. He has been unstoppable since and at the age of seven, he was placed third at the National Age Group Swimming Championship. He is now the undisputed champion in his age group. He has competed successfully in foreign meets, winning a gold medal in the 100m backstroke at the 6th International Sports Games in Russia. He also scored two silver medals at the 5 th Asian School Games.
As with Sachin, such exposure helped Akalanka mature as a swimmer. But behind his victories too, is a regimen of rigorous training. He swims at least 10kms a session, or 100kms a week. His day starts at 4.50am and he rushes to school afterwards.
Akalanka is a shining example of how a balance can be struck between studies and extracurricular activities. A student of St. Peters College, Colombo 4, he earned nine As at his GCE Ordinary Level Examination and is today studying commerce in preparation for his GCE Advanced Level Examination. He is simultaneously sitting his London A/Levels in the maths stream.
He will also be offered full time employment at the end of his swimming career.

Another Israeli massacre in Gaza
The tiny Mediterranean enclave Gaza  a 225 square metre strip of land with a population of more than 2million has never known peace. It has been under a tight blockade imposed by the aggressor state of Israel which forcibly occupies Palestinian land and constantly encroaches into the remaining Palestinian lands, building settlements, oppressing the people, practicing apartheid policies against the natives.
On March 30, the Land Day Palestinians demonstrated against illegal occupation of their lands beginning a sit-in-protest along the Israeli- Gaza border for six weeks till May 15. Men, women and Children- entire families joined in and all of them were unarmed. They were commemorating the killing of six unarmed Palestinians by Israeli Defence Forces 42 years ago in 1976.
Repeating the 1976 massacre Israeli forces which included over 100 snipers opened fire on the unarmed Palestinians killing 18 and wounding over 1,700 others.
Israeli government justified the shootings saying that the deceased were Hamas terrorists. Not only has Hamas not conducted any military operations there, but also, that all protestors were unarmed civilians. Gideon Levy commenting in the Haaretz newspaper has said killing of Palestinians is accepted in Israel more lightly than killing of mosquitoes.
The Western media, including the BBC also misreported the event saying that the deaths occurred during a clash between Palestinian protestors and Israeli soldiers. It was not a clash between two equally strong opponents. It was cold blooded murder by the aggressor against hapless people. (Such perverted interpretations are not infrequent among Sri Lankan media too!)
The demonstration was one of the largest seen in recent times and more than 30,000 people took part in it. It is named Return of the March.
Nepali Prime Minister visits India
Nepali Prime Minister Prasad Sharma Oli began an official visit to India yesterday (6). The visit is expected to improve relations between the two neighbours, which were somewhat strained for some time with Nepali politicians complaining about Indian interference. Nepals close relations with China had irked India.
Nepal has a stable government under a new democratic Constitution for the first time after the overthrow of the monarchy by an armed revolution during the latter part of the first decade of this Century. Oli Government has 88 percent confidence in Parliament according to a recent vote. The only significant political force outside the Government  Madhesis, is also having discussions to join it.
Relations between the two countries should be based on mutual respect and equality, according to Oli. It is necessary to correct and update many earlier signed treaties between the two countries, he told The Hindu in an interview. He cited the instance of the 1950 Treaty which was signed by the Prime Minister of India and the Indian Ambassador, the signatures alone showing the lack of respect.
Nepal also wants Indian projects to be completed expeditiously. For example, the Pancheswar and Makhali Project is still not completed after 22 years. Allaying Indian apprehensions that Nepal is getting too close to China, Prime Minister Oli said We want neighbours to develop and prosper so that we can sleep without worry. He added: We are careful and mindful of all sensibilities of our neighbours. But we will not enter into their competitive tournament.
The World in 2050
The world economy could more than double in size by 2050, far outstripping population growth, due to continued technology-driven productivity improvements, according to a research report published by Pricewatercoopers last year.
In 2050 the 10 leading economies would be China, India, the United States, Indonesia, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. From 2016 to 2015 Vietnam would move up 12 places from 32 to 20 in the world economy while Philippines would go up from 28 to 19 and Nigeria from 22 to 14.
Vietnam, India and Bangladesh will have the fastest economic growth rate of approximately 5 percent during 2016  50. In the African continent Nigeria will be the fastest with an annual growth rate of 4.2 percent.
The share of the world GDP of China will grow from 18 to 20 percent from 2016 to 2050.
During the same period Indias share will grow from 7 to 15 percent while that of the United States would decrease from 20 to 16 percent, of the European Union from 15 to 9 percent.
Thus by 2050 the Emerging Nations would replace the G7.

Colombo to be converted into a modern city - PM
Colombo city is being subjected to radical changes aiming to convert it into a modern and well-planned city, in keeping with the 21st century, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Under this move, several new flyovers will be constructed in Colombo city to ease traffic congestion. Accordingly, a new flyover will be constructed from Borella to Rajagiriya, while another will be constructed from Peliyagoda to Colombo Fort. Besides, a more flyovers are to be constructed in the future, the Prime Minister said.
Colombo city will be a modern city and moreover a financial city with various mega development projects planned for the future, the Prime Minister said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was speaking at an event yesterday organised to lay the foundation stone for a housing project, which consists of 400 housing units.
The housing project named Elliot Residencies is carried out for the middle income employees in the state and private sector by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry at Elliot Place, Borella.
The area was named as Elliot as a mark of gratitude to a journalist who worked at Lake House during the colonial era.
Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister further said that it has been planned to construct 50,000 housing units for low income families aiming to relocate families presently living in shanties. The 50,000 housing project has already been implemented by now and the Government has planned to complete the project by 2023.
When these families are relocated in new housing units constructed under the 50,000 housing project, the lands where these families presently are living can be utilised for the development of the city by implementing several projects. The ultimate aim of the project, which is carried out in three phases is to remove all the shanties from the Colombo city within 10 years, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added.
The Prime Minister said that housing units for middle income and low income families should be constructed as they are the workforce of the city.
The Premier further said that it has been planned to construct two new schools with all facilities in the Colombo Central and Colombo North areas under the education sector development activities.
The Colombo city development activities launched by late President Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1979 have been re-started under this Government, the Prime Minister said.

Cricket Australia defends role in crisis, announces player review
BRISBANE, Friday - Australia top cricket chiefs Friday ruled out stepping down after a ball-tampering scandal that shocked the nation, saying it was not the time for a witch-hunt as a review into player conduct was announced.
The sport has been engulfed in one of its biggest crisis after former captain Steve Smith, his deputy David Warner and batsman Cameron Bancroft attempted to alter the balls condition in the third Test in South Africa last month.
Smith and Warner were banned for a year and Bancroft for nine months, with the trio accepting their sanctions on Wednesday and Thursday.
Critics have questioned whether CAs role in the affair should come under scrutiny, but chairman David Peever said he did not intend to step down and that chief executive James Sutherlands job was not in jeopardy.
James Sutherlands position is not under review, he continues to retain the full support of the board, Peever told reporters in Brisbane.
In respect of my own position, no, I do not intend to step down, and that hasnt been suggested by the board. Our task now is to work through this problem and make sure we come through and cricket comes through it much more strongly.
I think we will all come under the microscope about what is happening in the organisation. But this is not the time for a witch-hunt.
Peever said the governing body was moving forward, with an independent review announced last week to have a broad remit and look into wider cultural and organisational issues in the sport.
He added that former ex-Test opener Rick McCosker would also chair a separate player and former-player driven process to consider a charter setting out standards of behaviour and expectations of Australian teams.
It is anticipated that this process will include assessments as to whether changes to codes and standards governing player conduct are required, Peever, a former managing director of mining giant Rio Tinto, said.
All three players have been dumped by sponsors as a result of the scandal, while Cricket Australia has been dropped by its top sponsor, fund manager Magellan.  AFP

East highland cultivators reaping bumper harvest
Highland cultivators in the Eastern Province are reaping a bumper harvest.
Beans, cabbage, carrot and other crops were cultivated in Kaluthavalai in the Batticaloa district. Harvesting had been successful in the coastal areas of Kaluthavalai with the use of farm yard manure and compost.
Vegetables cultivated as highland crops were betel, brinjal, chili, okra and onion. They are cultivated every season at Kaluthavalai. At present, farmers are engaged in up-country vegetable cultivation.
The Agriculture Department has taken steps to enhance agricultural crops in the Eastern Province. Fruits, green gram, maize, crown nut, kurakkan, cowpea and other supplementary food crops have been given priority under the programme.
Farmers are encouraged to grow more subsidy food crops and fruits. There are increased incentives for farmers of the Eastern Province to grow more subsidiary food crops. Crops are grown in large scale due to considerable profits.
Residents also engage in the cultivation of mushrooms in their home gardens in the Akkaraipattu area. Mushroom can be cultivated and harvested within a month, Akkaraipattu resident and mushroom cultivator S. L. M. Nazeer said. With the increase in the number of diabetic patients, the demand for mushrooms is increasing.

## Title: Fertiliser subsidy programme reintroduced

Fertiliser subsidy programme reintroduced
The government has taken measures to reintroduce the fertiliser subsidy programme from yesterday (6) onwards.
Cabinet approval has been granted to provide a 50 kg bulk of fertiliser for the use of paddy cultivation at a price of Rs.500 and a 50 kg bulk of fertiliser for other crops at a price of Rs 1,500, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
The fertiliser subsidy programme implemented during the previous regime had been cancelled by the Yahapalana Government considering the damage caused by chemical fertilisers to human lives and to the soil.
By removing the fertiliser subsidy, the Fertiliser Cash Grant (FCG) programme was introduced by the government to provide a Rs.25,000 allowance to farmers who cultivate paddy lands below two hectares in extent for the two seasons.
Considering the repeated requests made by farmers, the government has taken measures to bring back the fertiliser subsidy programme.
According to sources at the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute (HARTI), three types of fertilisers, Urea, TSP and MOP were issued as straight fertiliser under the fertiliser subsidy programme and a farmer was eligible to get the subsidy for five acres/two hectares or less per season.
Fertiliser subsidies were issued on the basis of recommendations given by the Department of Agriculture which were based on agro climatic zones and irrigation schemes. Therefore, quantities were issued according to the land extent and respective fertiliser recommendation. Under this scheme, the subsidy had been provided for paddy and other crops. Paddy farmers had to pay Rs.350 per bag of 50 kgs and it was compulsory for them to contribute for a crop insurance scheme by paying Rs.150 per 50 kgs. For other crops, a straight fertiliser bag of 50 kg was issued at a price of Rs.1,250. The fertiliser was also available in the open market at a price of Rs.1,250 per 50kgs, sources said.
With the introduction of the FCG, farmers were entitled for a cash subsidy of Rs.25,000 per hectare per year subjected to a maximum of Rs.50,000 per year under the FCG programme. Accordingly, a farmer with two hectares will receive Rs.25,000 for Yala and Rs.25,000 for Maha.
In contrast to the Fertiliser Subsidy programme,the cash grant will be purely based on the land extent. The maximum retail price of a 50 kg bag of straight fertiliser, that is urea, TSP and MOP, is Rs.2,500 and farmers are expected to buy the available fertiliser according to their requirement from the cash grant they get. Farmers cultivating potato, onion, chili, soya beans and maize are also entitled to this cash subsidy. They will get a cash subsidy of Rs.10,000 per hectare per year per farmer.
According to a survey conducted in 2017 by HARTI to ascertain the farmers responses towards the FCG programme, the majority of farmers have not experienced a significant change either in their cultivated extent or with the harvest due to the introduction of the NFCG programme.
Similarly, the majority of farmers have not experienced a significant change in the use of organic fertiliser and inorganic fertiliser with the introduction of the FCG programme.

Fifty schools commit to SDG Action Campaign
Fifty schools selected for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Action Campaign received financial grants and technical support at an event held in Colombo today.
The Campaign for the SDGs is led by the UN in Sri Lanka together with the Education Ministry in partnership with the Hatton National Bank and the Presidential Secretariat to reach out to school students from across the country to design and implement an SDG based project in their communities.
The launch of the Goals created a landmark moment in creating a much better world without leaving no one behind by 2030. However, achieving these 17 SDGs is everyones responsibility.
Speaking about the students role in contributing to the SDGs, Secretary to the Ministry of Education Sunil Hettiarachchi stated that This student led campaign shows good potential to serve as an excellent platform to pave a path towards achieving the SDGs in Sri Lanka. Since the launch of the campaign on 24 October 2017 commemorating UN Day, over 700 schools submitted their proposals and upon evaluation by the partners of the campaign, 50 SDG-centred proposals were selected representing the 25 districts. These schools will now be linked with relevant experts and institutions, enhancing the students' capacity to mobilise the communities around to help Sri Lanka achieve the SDGs.
Director, ILO Country Office for Sri Lanka and the Maldives and the UN Communications Group Chair, Simrin Singh stated that taking action for the SDGs is a collective effort. "From the youngest student to the most experienced teacher, schools play an important role in spreading the word that everyone has a responsibility. The question is no longer if you want your classroom to connect to the world; the question now is simply when, she said.
Chief Human Resource Officer/ Deputy General Manager of Hatton National Bank L Chiranthi Cooray stated,At HNB we are pleased to support young Sri Lankans to be part of and practically experience sustainable activities and their results. This programme would be extremely significant to create awareness on the SDG and the triple bottom line for a sustainable planet.
Engaging youth is vital to Sri Lanka achieving the sustainable development to eradicate poverty, address climate change and build peaceful, inclusive societies for all.

## Title: Five attempts to rein in Australian cricket sledging

Five attempts to rein in Australian cricket sledging
SYDNEY, Friday - Cricket Australia announced Friday that former Test batsman Rick McCosker would head a review into player behaviour in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal, echoing moves made as far back as 15 years ago.
Here are five attempts to rein in sledging, or verbal abuse, in Australian cricket:
2003, THE SPIRIT OF CRICKET
By 2003, the Australians antics were beginning to mar their on-field success.
The flashpoint came in the West Indies when paceman Glenn McGrath baited Ramnaresh Sarwan with a lewd taunt and the batsman had the temerity to respond in kind.
McGrath exploded with rage, looming over the diminutive Sarwan and threatening to rip your throat out. Cricket Australia demanded action and captain Steve Waugh drafted a Spirit of Cricket manifesto setting guidelines for player behaviour, including respecting umpires and opponents.
Result: The number of ICC charges against Australian players fell for a year or two before creeping back up.
2005, HOOLIGAN SPORT
The then-ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed warned Australia and South Africa to tone down what he termed a war of words ahead of a Test series in Australia.
(I) remind the players of the importance of playing within the spirit of the game ahead of this series, he said.
The-then ICC president Ehsan Mani went further.
There is a growing number of incidents of verbal exchanges on the field, and theyre concerning for us, he said.
We dont want cricket reduced to a level where it turns into a hooligan sport.
Result: Former Australian paceman Jeff Thomson accused the ICC of trying to take the fun out of the game, calling it a waste of space. Cricket Australia chief James Sutherland dismissed the conduct as banter.
2008, MONKEY-GATE
The Australian media called out the teams behaviour after the infamous Monkey-gate controversy involving India in 2008.
A spat between Harbhajan Singh and Andrew Symonds in the second Test resulted in the Indian spinner being charged with racial abuse after allegedly calling the Australian a monkey.
Harbhajan was hit with a three-match ban, later overturned when India threatened to abandon the tour and go home. The Australian newspaper labelled the home teams conduct in the lead-up to the row as boorish, arrogant and ungracious.
The attitude and behaviour of Australian players worsens the moment their superiority is seriously challenged, it said.
The Sydney Morning Heralds late cricket writer Peter Roebuck called for Australias captain Ricky Ponting to be sacked.
Ponting has presided over a performance that dragged the game into the pits. He turned a group of professional cricketers into a pack of wild dogs, Roebuck wrote.
Result: Sutherland leapt to his players defence. Test cricket is what is being played here. Its not tiddlywinks, he said.
2015, WORLD CUP WARNING
As Australia prepared to co-host the 2015 World Cup with New Zealand, officials promised a clampdown on sledging.
Abrasive batsman David Warner, a key figure in the ball-tampering plot, caused outrage in a warm-up one-dayer by abusing Rohit Sharma and telling the batsman to speak English.  Quite simply, he needs to stop looking for trouble, CAs Sutherland told reporters.
ICC chief David Richardson warned verbal abuse would not be allowed at the games showpiece tournament.
There have been too many examples of player behaviour going too far and overstepping the boundaries of acceptability, he said.
Result: Warner toned down his sledging to avoid a suspension only for wicketkeeper Brad Haddin to take over the role of attack dog. The Australians gave New Zealands batsmen a series of ugly send-offs as they won the final at a canter. They deserved it, Haddin said afterward.
2016, UGLY UNDERBELLY
Former Test batsman Phillip Hughes died while playing in a domestic match in Sydney in 2014, prompting an inquest that once again put the spotlight on sledging. Coroner Michael Barnes heard claims a bowler told Hughes Im going to kill you during the match, although the players involved denied it.
In his 2016 findings, Barnes determined Hughes died when a short-pitched delivery hit him on the neck and ruled on-field intimidation could not be implicated in his death.
But he called sledging an unsavoury aspect of cricket, adding: An outsider is left to wonder why such a beautiful game would need such an ugly underside.
Result: Former and current players argued they should not have to control their on-field behaviour, it was an issue for umpires. Sledging is something that has always been talked about regularly, but the umpires should step in if they think it is over the top, former Test captain Mark Taylor said. - AFP

Five cricketers who have scored the most Test centuries at a single venue
Cricket is always characterized by numbers, stats, and figures. The dominance of a team, the greatness of a batsman, and the impact of a bowler is asserted through the numbers they have racked up over the years.
While perusing through the career of a batsman, the number of runs he scored in different countries and continents is always an important factor to consider. Some men tend to perform well at home, while others show their ability on away tours.
However, in some special cases, a particular batsman tends to find a mysterious affinity with a single venue. He does not know how to fail there and almost every time he takes the field there, he churns out admirable performances.
Let us take a look at five such cricketers who have scored the most Test centuries at a single venue:
MICHAEL CLARKE: ADELAIDE OVAL, 7 CENTURIES
Michael Clarkes name will always be remembered fondly in Australian cricket.
The young prodigy of the golden era of the Kangaroos, Clarke was a part of the team that conquered the world and also the team that fell through the ranks, a few years later.
However, he captained his country to glory once again and took his team to the World Number 1 ranking in Test cricket and clinching the ICC World Cup in 2015.
The Pup was particularly fond of the Adelaide Oval, where he scored as many as seven Test centuries. In the 17 innings that he has played on the ground, he has crossed at least 50 runs on ten occasions.
The former Australian skipper has an extraordinary batting average of 94.29 at the venue and has also scored two double centuries there in a single year - 230 against South Africa and 210 against India in 2012.
KUMAR SANGAKKARA: SINHALESE SPORTS CLUB GROUND, 8 CENTURIES
This left-hander arguably is the greatest Test batsman produced by Sri Lanka.
His enviable record in the longest format of the game is awe-inspiring and his immense contribution to Sri Lankan cricket is now part of a phenomenal legacy.
Kumar Sangakkara finds the fourth place on this list with eight Test centuries at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo.
In the 34 innings that he has played at the venue, he has scored 50 or more runs on fifteen occasions.
The former Sri Lankan batsman has three double centuries to his name on this ground and has maintained an impressive average of 74.58 there.
His last innings at the SSC came in August 2014, wherein he managed to shine once again, scoring 59 from 130 deliveries to contribute to a Sri Lankan win against Pakistan.
JACQUES KALLIS: NEWLANDS CRICKET GROUND, 9 CENTURIES
The highest score of the former South African cricketers international career came at Newlands
In the wake of the ball-tampering scandal in the second match of South Africa- Australia Test series, the NCG in Cape Town has been getting a lot of the negative spotlight recently. However, the ground has seen some incredible cricket through the years and has been privy too numerous superlative knocks.
Jacques Kallis, arguably the greatest cricketing all-rounder of all time, stands third on this list with nine hundreds at this venue. He has scored 2181 runs in Cape Town with a batting average of 72.70, which is bolstered by 18 fifty-plus scores from him.
The highest score of the former South African cricketers international career came at Newlands, where he played a match-winning knock of 224 against Sri Lanka in 2012.
DON BRADMAN: MELBOURNE CRICKET GROUND, 9 CENTURIES
The Dons record at the Melbourne Cricket Ground tells an astonishing tale. Whenever international batting records are discussed and dissected, the name of the great Donald Bradman has to pop into the conversation somewhere along the way. His unquenchable thirst for runs and incomprehensible talent saw him set some incredible batting records, some of which may always remain unbreachable in the history of the sport.
His record at the Melbourne Cricket Ground tells an astonishing tale: 11 matches, 1671 runs and 9 Test centuries. For someone whose career batting average stands at 99.94, Bradman outdid even himself at the MCG, with a peerless average of 128.53 and the highest score of 270 in the 1937 Ashes.
His last match in Melbourne came against India back in 1948, where he captained the hosts to a victory by an innings and 177 runs. The legendary batsman also contributed 7 unbeaten runs with the willow in the game to cap an incredibly successful stint for him at the MCG.
MAHELA JAYAWARDENE: SINHALESE SPORTS CLUB GROUND, 11 CENTURIES
The two gems of Sri Lankan cricket, Mahela Jayawardene and Sangakkara, have scored as many as 19 centuries between them at a single venue. That, in itself, is the ultimate testament to their unmatchable endowment as a pair to the longest format of the game.
Jayawardene sits at the apex of this list comfortably with 11 Test centuries at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo. With his calm disposition and elegant strokeplay, the right-hander accumulated 2921 runs at this ground with an average of 74.89 in 42 innings. The highest Test score of his career also came at the SSC, when he smashed 374 runs past the Proteas in July 2006.
It will always be an incredibly special venue for the former Sri Lankan skipper: not only because he boasts of a fantastic record there but also because he played the last match of his career at the SSC. In his last batting innings, he scored 54 against Pakistan to play a vital role in Sri Lankas victory in the game. - SK
