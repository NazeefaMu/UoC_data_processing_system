Ban imports of locally grown foods
Attention should be drawn by officials towards an immediate ban on the import of food crops which can be grown locally without trying to submit consumer reports made according to the needs of various racketeers, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President made this observation addressing the National Farmer Convention on cultivation of barren paddy fields held at the Magampura Ruhunu International Conference Hall in Hambantota yesterday.
This marked the inaugural programme of a series of countrywide awareness programmes for farmers to induce them to cultivate all barren paddy lands in order to fulfill national development targets, the President said.
Referring to the Ginganga and Nilwala projects, the President said the government may be forced to launch fresh investigations into alleged acts of fraud and corruption that occurred during their implementation. This has to be done taking into cognizance the inordinate delay in the ongoing investigations into these projects. However, he had to emphasise to members of the government on whom the responsibility had been cast to implement these projects that they should endeavour to accomplish these tasks by safeguarding political values.
The government subscribed to the view that the Ginganga-Nilwala project was quintessential for a new chapter in the development of the Hambantota and Matara district as expected by the farmers in these two districts, the President said.
The President also explained in detail the programme of work undertaken by the government to create a re-awakening in the agriculture sector and uplift the farmer economy. President Maithripala Sirisena said SriLankan Airlines served him cashew nuts while travelling from Kathmandu to Colombo via New Delhi but he simply could not eat the poor quality cashew.
He said that neither a human being nor a dog will eat these cashew nuts.
Who authorised the purchase of these cashew nuts for SriLankan Airlines the asked.
A memorandum containing farmers problems and grievances was also handed over to the President at this meeting.
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanne and Provincial Agriculture Minister U.G.D. Ariyatilleke were also present on the occasion.
The President also opened a new three storey building of the Ambalantota Divisional Secretariat built at a cost of Rs.99 million by unveiling a plaque.
The President later inspected the building. Several other programmes were also held to coincide with this event. These included the handing over of land title deeds to people in the area, equipment to disabled persons, scholarship grants to schoolchildren and service appreciation awards to agriculture officers in the Hambantota district.
Minister Vajira Abeywardena, Home Affairs Ministry Secretary S.T. Kodikara Hambantota GA M.K. Harischandra and several government and opposition politicians were also present on the occasion.

Scientific knowledge vital to solve development issues
Addressing the inauguration of the first bureau meeting of the 14th Governing Council of the Centre for Science and Technology of the Non Aligned and Other Developing Countries, in Colombo on Thursday 6th, Minister of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development, & Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage, Dr. Sarath Amunugama said, that the world today is very different from the time when the Non Aligned Summit was held in Colombo in 1976.
He said we now live in a multi-polar world as distinct from the bi-polar world of that era, when the Non Aligned Movement had a distinct role to play. He pointed out that some non aligned countries like India and other developing countries of that era like China have forged ahead technologically and therefore their present requirements in regard to science and technology are different from those of many other non aligned and developing countries.
Citing his own ministrys prioritization as an example, the minister said that his ministry has identified four areas for immediate attention. The first he said was the possible use of modern technologies like drone technology and satellite technology for land and crop mapping to enable scientific forecasts to be made about harvests, enabling timely action to be taken in different situations.
The second he said was the evaluation of the current land use for agriculture in the dry zone and the wet zone and examining whether a departure from the existing pattern, by the dry zone concentrating in a more technologically advanced and therefore more productive cultivation of paddy while the wet zone with its present marginal productivity in paddy cultivation switching over to some other productive avenues like export agriculture, would be more advantageous to the country. The third area of inquiry is the possible use of desalination as a solution to the problem of sea water intrusion into coastal area cropland.
The last item of inquiry he said was the feasibility and possible advantage of regional or provincial power grids for distribution of electricity instead of the present single national grid.
The Minister speculated that other non aligned and developing countries at a similar stage of development may have similar practical problems needing the application modern scientific knowledge and technology while bigger countries like India would have issues at a different level.
In conclusion the minister invited the foreign delegates to have a look at the on-going Port City development that he characterized as one of the most significant ongoing projects in present day Asia.

## Title: Contaminated milk packets issue goes to Police

Contaminated milk packets issue goes to Police
Minister Harin Fernando, Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara and MP Mujibar Rahuman yesterday lodged a complaint at the Mirihana Police against the allegations made by Joint Opposition (JO) that they distributed contaminated milk packets among the JO supporters who attended the recent rally held in Colombo.
Following a media briefing held at the Sirikotha UNP headquarters, Fernando, Bandara and Rahuman went to the Mirihana Police at around 2.45 p.m. to lodge the complaint.
Addressing the media thereafter, Minister Harin Fernando said that they have lodged the complaint requesting a full investigation with regards to the incident as well as the persons who are trying to sling mud and trying to put the blame on them.
We hope both the police and the CID will be informed about this complaint and a full and fair investigation be conducted on this, he said.
Everyone must have seen the way these protesters were treated. They brought food from Lorries and threw the lunch packets at their supporters as if they were some slaves. Is there any wonder if their stomachs got upset after consuming such food. Maybe the stingy organisers did give these people rotten food, Minister Fernando observed.
MP Mujibar Rahuman who was also present at the Mirihana Police Station, told the media that he has decided to file a defamation case against those who leveled allegations against him about distributing the said milk packets.
He pointed out that JO MP Wimal Weerawansa and MP Shehan Semasinghe have alleged that it was he who was behind distributing the packets of contaminated milk to the protesters. He also urged the JO to file a proper complaint without talking about the incident at media conferences.
Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara addressing the media said that the JO is trying to cover up their unsuccessful Jana Balaya Kolombata protest by bringing up the milk packet incident.
He said that the police will conduct a fair and independent investigation into the matter. They are only trying to divert the attention from their unsuccessful protest to the government, by using politically bankrupt figures to sling mud at us. The Deputy Minister pointed out.
Meanwhile, the trio expressed their observations on the same incident at a press brief held at Sirikotha Headquaters earlier in the afternoon. Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando at the media brief said that the Joint Opposition is trying to provoke the general public by holding MP Mujibar Rahuman responsible for the so called poisoned milk packets.
If you study this closely you will see that the JO has specifically targeted MP Mujibar Rahuman to this case, who happens to be a Muslim. If you put two and two together, you will see how that Digana infertility pills myth came into being. Even at this incident, the JO wanted to imply that poison milk packets were distributed by a Muslim MP. This is how cheap, short sighted and stupid they can be.
Speaking about JO MP Wimal Weerawansas allegation against Rahuman who apparently injected poison into the milk packets, Minister Fernando mocked Weerawansa for making such a senseless statement. If someone can inject a drug to develop Weerawansas brain, it will be a great action, he said.
Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara speaking on the same subject said that the JO is telling fairy tales to conceal the failed protest recently organised by them.
By midnight, the Joint Opposition lost even their undergarments out of sheer shame of a very much failed protest. So they were using to cover up their nudity using a milk packet. There was no reason for us to attack the protesters in anyway. Only one person has lodged a complaint against this incident at the police. A person called Rathnasiri Jayasooriya, who has not consumed these milk packets has lodged a complaint. He also has failed to mention a person or a vehicle that was involved in distributing the milk packets, the Deputy Minister pointed out.
Speaking further about the inconsistency in the allegation, MP Mujibar Rahuman said that the accusers could not identify the location where these said milk packets were distributed.
The JO MPs said that these milk packets were distributed at Maligawatte whereas the person who complained has mentioned it was at Slave Island. These are two contradictory stories. The people who got sick from consuming this milk were admitted to hospital around eight in the night. Thirty nine people were admitted. According to them, these milk packets were distributed among them around 3.p.m. Even when they were admitted to the hospital, they had the empty milk packets with them, which is very unnatural, Rahuman pointed out.
While observing that most of the JO supporters who had joined the protest were seen passed out on the streets, Minister Harin Fernando said perhaps an inquiry should be made as to what kind of alcohol was distributed among these protesters.
Meanwhile, organisers of the press brief gave milk packets as refreshments to the media personnel who covered the event.
Meanwhile, the Joint Opposition yesterday said the vehicle used to distribute the contaminated milk packets for the protesters of the Janabalaya Kolombata held last Wednesday, belonged to a government ministry.
Addressing the media in Colombo, JO member, Parliamentarian Shehan Semasinghe said the UNP was behind the move to sabotage the protest. He said the JO will reveal more details about this incident shortly.

Afghan man arrested after Paris knife attack
FRANCE: Seven people including two British tourists were wounded in Paris late Sunday by a knife-wielding man, a terrifying attack that bystanders tried to stop by throwing petanque balls at the assailant.
Four of the victims were in a critical condition, police said, after the man brandishing a large blade and and iron bar went on the rampage next to a canal in the northeast of the capital.
The suspect is believed to be an Afghan national and has been arrested, said a source close to the enquiry, adding he had targeted strangers but that nothing at this stage shows signs of a terrorist nature.
Chaos erupted on the banks of the Bassin de la Villette, an area popular with locals and visitors who frequent the cafes, cinemas and other cultural venues along its banks, just after 11:00pm Paris time.
Eyewitness Youssef Najah, 28, said he was walking beside the canal when he saw a man running and holding a knife about 25-30 cm (10-11 inches) long.
There were around 20 people chasing him. They started throwing petanque balls at him, Najah said, referring to the sport popular in France also known as boules.
Around four or five balls hit him in the head, but they werent able to stop him, he added.
According to the same witness, the attacker then dived into an alleyway, where the man tried to hide behind two British tourists. We said to them: Watch out, he has a knife. But they didnt react. The pair were then attacked, he said.
A security guard at one of two cinemas on either side of the water said he had seen the attacker running away from two men who were trying to stop him.
He had an iron bar in his hand which he threw at the men chasing him, then he took out a knife, he told AFP.
The UK foreign office said it was aware of reports of the attack and was urgently investigating this incident in cooperation with French authorities, British media reported.
A police investigation has been launched for attempted murder, according to a judicial source.
It is the latest of several knife attacks France has seen in recent months, with terrorism being ruled out in most cases. On August 23, a man stabbed his mother and sister to death and seriously injured another person in a town near Paris before being shot dead by police.
The motive for the violence remained unclear despite a claim by the Islamic State (IS) group that it was an attack by one of its fighters responding to the terror organisations propaganda.
Authorities said the 36-year-old had serious mental health problems and had been on a terror watch list since 2016.
That attack came days after an Afghan asylum-seeker was arrested in town of Perigueux for a drunken rampage with a knife in which four people were wounded, one seriously. Police said investigators had very quickly dismissed a terrorist motive after the August 13 incident.
And on June 17, two people were hurt in another southern town when a woman shouting Allahu akbar (God is greatest) attacked them in a supermarket with a boxcutter knife.
France has been on high alert following a string of jihadist attacks in recent years, often by people who have become radicalised or claim to have acted in the name of the IS group.
More than 240 people have been killed by Islamist extremists since a massacre at the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine in Paris in January 2015. - AFP

ALFEA calls for withdrawal of FBR
The Association of Licensed Foreign Employment Agencies (ALFEA) yesterday urged the government to call off the Family Background Report (FBR) which is an administrative necessity before housemaids are permitted to be employed abroad.
Addressing the media yesterday at Hotel Renuka, Colombo, ALFEA Chairman A.L.M. Hazam alleged that the FBR has become a racket which damages the reputation of the country.
He proposed the government introduce an appropriate practical procedure for this purpose, instead. The FBR was introduced in 2013 to prevent the migration of mothers with children less than five years of age, as housemaids abroad.
Although the purpose of introducing the FBR is good, it has created lots of problems in the foreign employment sector of the country, he said.
Currently, foreign remittances to Sri Lanka have declined to US$ 6.5 billion from US$ 8 billion, Hazam said.
He alleged that some officers are currently engaged in issuing fake FBRs at high cost. A development officer of the Northern Province has been suspended for issuing more than 1,000 fake FBRs, he said.
A proposal to call off the FBR has already been submitted to the Cabinet.

Boks coach says job on the line against All Blacks
Wellington, Monday: South Africa coach Johan Rassie Erasmus admitted Monday his job may be on the line against the All Blacks this weekend after two straight defeats in the Rugby Championship left his six-month tenure in serious jeopardy.
South Africa head into Saturdays match on the back of losses to Australia and Argentina, with memories of a 57-0 drubbing the last time they played in New Zealand still raw.
Erasmus said a similar result in Wellington this weekend would probably spell the end of his tenure, even though he only took over in March.
Probably just for me to survive its fairly important, but thats beside the point, he told reporters in Wellington.
If we can beat the All Blacks here, everybody will think we have a realistic chance of winning the World Cup next year. People will say theres growth.
The former Test flanker said the recent losses -- and the Springboks slipping to seventh in the world rankings -- meant he was facing pressure from South Africas ruthless fans, but his main aim was to ensure the Springboks were in better shape than when he took over.
He has also vowed to speed up the integration of black players into the national side to reflect demographic realities in South Africa, and in June named flanker Siya Kolisi to the captaincy -- the first time a black South African had ever led the Springboks. If Im here or not, I want the next coach who goes to the World Cup to have a squad whos representative of South Africa, whos got enough experience, whos gone through tough times in New Zealand and Australia, he said.
Erasmus conceded facing the All Blacks was daunting but said it was a chance for his young players to show what we have.
This is the ultimate test to see where we are. Did we actually improve in the last six matches or are we getting worse
After ringing the changes against Argentina and Australia, Erasmus said he did not want to tinker too much with the side that will play New Zealand.
However, he said South Africa would be without wing Makazole Mapimpi, who limped off against Australia.
Hes flying back today to get scans and stuff. Were not going to get a replacement in for him, he said.
Hes definitely out for this weekend.

Almanac case against Basil
CA extends Interim Order staying proceedings
The Court of Appeal yesterday further extended its Interim Order staying any further proceeding into the controversial almanac case filed against former Minister Basil Rajapaksa before High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga who was presiding over Court No. 6 of the Colombo High Court, until September 21.
The Court of Appeal made this order consequent to a Transfer Application filed by former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa seeking an order staying any further proceedings into the almanac case heard before Colombo High Court Judge Kulatunga.
Meanwhile, the transfer application was fixed for inquiry on September 21 by the Court of Appeal.
Rajapaksa has sought an order transferring the case from the Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Kulatunga to any other court of the High Court of Colombo.
High Court Judge Kulatunga also delivered the judgement regarding the controversial sil redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case. Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita were sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the TRC.
In his petition, Basil Rajapaksa stated that High Court Judge Kulatunga was a member of the Presidential Commission PRECIFAC which initiated an inquiry against him.
He further stated that one of the primary grounds on which the proceedings before PRECIFAC are sought to be challenged by him before the Court of Appeal is his complaint that he was denied a fair hearing at the purported inquiry by the PRECIFAC.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against the former Minister and former Divi Neguma Department Director General Kithsiri Ranawaka in the Colombo High Court for allegedly printing five million almanacs with the image of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, costing Rs. 29.4 million, to be used as election propaganda material during the January 2015 Presidential Election.
Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana with counsel Navin Marapana and Counsel Sanath Wijewardena appeared for Basil Rajapaksa. Senior State Counsel Sudarshana Silva appeared for the Attorney General.

CDS fails to appear before CID
Former Navy Commander and Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne had been summoned by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to give a statement yesterday but he had left the country on an official tour, CID sources said.
Speaking to the Daily News a CID official said that Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne had notified the CID of his official engagement only last morning, but by that time he had already left the country.
He was summoned to give a statement with regard to the abduction of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009. The Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne had ordered the CID to take necessary action to arrest former Navy Commander and Chief of Defence Staff on August 29 in the event there is sufficient evidence to prove that he had aided and abetted Navy Officer, Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi alias Navy Sampath, to abscond the magisterial inquiry into the disappearance of 11 youths.
Navy Sampath, was arrested by the CID on Lotus Road in Colombo on August 13. He had been in hiding employed as a security guard at an estate using a fake identity card.
The CID said that there was sufficient evidence to arrest the CDS for aiding the main suspect evade arrest but he had to report to the CID for a statement first. There is also suspicion on whether Admiral Wijegunaratne would return to the country to face the inevitable. However, in the event he fails to return the CID said legal action would be initiated against him.
The CID also said that they would notify court of the current situation, adding that Admiral Wijegunaratne had requested the CID for a date after September 19 in order to record his statement. Hence, the CID said that considering the fact that the CDS had left the country on an official engagement, a new date would be set for the recording of his statement.

Presidents statement proves his honesty
I was very astonished to hear the President Maithripala Sirisenas recent statement at a national awards ceremony held at the parliamentary complex to felicitate the state institutions for their high level performances that he was ready to impose the death penalty on those who have abused and misused the public assets and state funds.
From this grievous statement we could clearly understand how colossally the public assets and state funds have been misused by the past and present politicians. Those politicians whoever they may be, should be ashamed and should have thought of committing suicide by themselves after hearing the presidents statement.
At this juncture, the presidents anxiety of deploring corruption and abusing of public property is very much laudable and his statement proves that he is an honest, loyal and clean politician to lead this country.

The Western Provincial Council (WPC) has been summoned before the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) on September 18.
The COPA has summoned the WPC while it is embroiled in a controversy over the expenditure borne for its new building complex at Denzil Kobbekaduwa Mawatha in Battaramulla.
The import of 104 chairs each valued at Rs 640,000 for the council received public backlash last month.
Added to that, JVP Councilor Lakshman Nipunarachchi came up with another revelation last week that Rs.15 million has been spent on the Councils new chamber door, which is gold plated and bears carvings from the Kotte era.
The JVP has also complained to the Auditor General over spending of public money on the Leader of the House, Chief Government Whip, Opposition Leader and Chief Opposition Whip posts in the Provincial Councils stating that those are not legitimately recognised as coming under the Provincial Council Act.
The WPC administration is due to appear before the COPA at 2.30 pm on September 18, and the public are invited to direct their complaints and issues related to the institution prior to that day through post or email.

Creepy Snow White fan theory
A devastating new fan theory is going to change the way you look at Snow White forever! Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs may be beloved Disney classic, but a devastating fan theory suggests that the films heroine actually dies at the end - and the prince is the Grim Reaper whose kiss is actually the kiss of death.
Inspired by a 19th century German tale, the movie, and released n 1937 was the first-full length animated movie by Disney.
However, according to a story published in Mail Online, it turns out that Snow Whites happy ending might not have been that happy at all.
The in-depth argument that Snow White actually dies at the end of the flick was written by Matt Morgan, who claimed there are many people who believe the raven haired beautys happily ever after is all a lie.
According to him, it looks like she dies at the end of the film, but is brought back with the kiss of true love. He, however, asks readers to re-watch the film from an adults perspective. Referring to the 16th century German aristocrat Margaretha von Waldeck, who some believe was the inspiration behind the fairy tale, he adds that Margaretha lived in a mining town that employed child workers, so it was theorized that the seven dwarfs in the story are actually a reference to child labour. When she was a teenager, she moved out of her fathers home and her beauty attracted the attention of Philip II of Spain while she was in Brussels.
She became mysteriously ill and died at the age of 21. It was widely thought that she was poisoned because someone didnt want her marrying Philip. Sound familiar
The Brothers Grimm heard the tale and recorded it which eventually became Snow White. As for the prince being the Grim Reaper, he says, She gets her first glimpse at the prince when she gets her first glimpse at death; when she almost falls into the well and dies.
To argue his point further, he went on to say that the prince came to see Snow White a second time after she bit the poison apple and was lying in a coffin.
He arrives on a pale white horse (which is what Death was often portrayed riding at the time). He kisses her, he wrote.
The kiss of death is a way people knew someone had passed before they knew about taking pulses. As for the final scene, Matt said Snow Whites death was the reason why the seven dwarfs had to stay behind.
According to him, Snow and the Prince say goodbye to the dwarfs rather than bring them along because theyre going somewhere the living cant follow.

Djokovic wins third US Open, equals Sampras on 14 Grand Slams
NEW YORK, Monday: Novak Djokovic clinched his third US Open title on Sunday with a 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 triumph over Juan Martin del Potro, taking him level with Pete Samprass mark of 14 Grand Slams.
Djokovic, playing in his eighth final in New York and already the champion in 2011 and 2015, is now just three Slams behind Rafael Nadal and six back from the all-time record 20 held by Roger Federer.
It was also the third time the 31-year-old Serb -- who missed last years tournament with an elbow injury which sent his career into a mini-crisis -- completed the Wimbledon-US Open double.
I want to say Pete, I love you, youre my idol, said Djokovic of Sampras.
To the support of the loved ones, my kids, my wife, my small team of people that has been there with me through difficult times as well, added the Serb who underwent elbow surgery after the Australian Open in January.
For world number three Del Potro, it was a heartbreaking experience coming in just his second Slam final, nine years after he was crowned US Open champion before a long battle with wrist injuries pushed him into depression and to the brink of retirement.
When I had my surgery I could truly understand what Juan Martin was going through when he had surgeries that kept him away form the tour for two or three years, added Djokovic.
It was Djokovics 15th win over the Del Potro and fifth in five at the Slams.
It came in a final which was business-like rather than thrilling, a relief for a tournament still reeling from the controversial womens final on Saturday.
The result also means that 50 of the last 55 majors have been won by the Big Four of Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Andy Murray.
Del Potro backed Djokovic to surpass Federers mark of 20 Slams.
Of course he can. Novak has everything to make records in this sport, said the Argentine.
MY IDOL DJOKOVIC
I was so happy to be playing the final against this magnificent idol, added Del Potro of his close friend Djokovic.
He knows that hes one of my friends on tour and he knows hes one player I want to watch win on tour. Of course Im sad to lose but Im happy for Novak as well. You deserve to win.
With the Arthur Ashe Stadium roof closed as heavy rain swept New York, conditions were slow and sluggish.
After taking just two points off Del Potros first three service games, Djokovic, in his 23rd final at the majors, pounced to break for 5-3.
The key was his success with a lung-busting 22-shot rally and he pocketed the set when the 29-year-old del Potro netted a forehand.
It was only the second set dropped by the Argentine at the tournament.
For Djokovic, it was an illustration of him growing into the championships as he took his run of consecutive sets won to 14, stretching back to the second round against Tennys Sandgren.
Djokovic was soon 3-1 up in the second set before Del Potro carved out his first break point of the match to level at 3-3.
He had three more chances in the eighth, all saved by Djokovic in a marathon 20-minute game which left even Hollywood superstar Meryl Streep clasping her head in astonishment.
The effort took its toll on a suddenly weary-looking Del Potro as a 95-minute set was claimed by Djokovic in the tiebreak.
Del Potro was looking at having to become the first man since Pancho Gonzales in 1949 to win the US title from two sets down.
Djokovic sprinted into a 3-1 lead in the third set before a battling Del Potro clung on, hitting back for 3-3.
But off the back of a 24-shot rally, Djokovic broke again for 5-3 and he was within tantalising touching distance of his 14th Grand Slam title, just three months after he had left Roland Garros in despair after a shattering quarter-final exit. - AFP

Remembering Bakeer Markar
Epitome of honesty and integrity
Deshamanya Marhoom Al Haj Mohammed Abdul Bakeer Markar's ancestry is traced to Sheik Jamaluddeen-Al-Maghdoomi, an Arab settler who settled down in Beruwala. His father Hakeem Alia Marikkar Mohomed Marikkar belonged to a family of physicians, whose ancestors too were physicians. So much so his ancestral home was known as Hakeem Villa which meant Veda Gedera (Home of the Physician). It is said that patients even from Maldives visited him for treatment.
Abdul Bakeer Markar was born in Beruwala on May 12, 1917 and educated at Zahira College, Colombo under the tutelage of Dr. T.B. Jayah, the Principal of Zahira College. He held a number of responsible and honorary positions at Zahira, such as Editor of the College Magazine, President of the College Majilis and the Literary Association. He entered Colombo Law College in 1940 and having passed out as a lawyer, he had a lucrative practice and was elected President of the Kalutara District Branch of the Bar Association of Ceylon.
Since his childhood, he exhibited his humble qualities which I presume was the road to achieve greatness, win respect from people of all walks of life and attract intimacy from the society. The family history which claimed great social activity, especially due to the ancestry running with Medicine, made Al Haj Bakeer Markar very popular among everyone in the area, irrespective of race, religion, caste or any other differences. No wonder he was enchanted to politics as a consequence and the public was enchanted with gratitude to elect him as their representative too.
Al Haj Bakeer Markars life as a politician was even more illustrious than his life as a lawyer. His upbringing from a popular family and friendly mannerisms were reasonable grounds for it to happen. He was first an elected member of the Beruwala Urban Council and later appointed its Chairman. His next step in the political ladder was to become the Member of Parliament for Beruwala. He was reelected and continued from April 1965 to March 1970. He was the Deputy Speaker from August 4, 1977 to September 7, 1978, and succeeded as Speaker from September 1978 to August 1983, a Cabinet Minister and the Governor of the Southern Province from June 13, 1988 to December 1993.
First Speaker of the New Parliament
His name, which was equal to honesty and integrity in politics, is immortalized in the history of the Parliament of Sri Lanka, of being the last Speaker of the Old Parliament, and, the First Speaker of the New Parliament. His service to the people was so great it was convenient for his son Imthiaz Bakeer Markar who inherited and possessed great qualities to be elected to serve the Beruwala Electorate as the Member of Parliament and even to serve as a Government Minister latterly. Here it is relevant to note what WJM Lokubandara stated at the Condolence Motion on Al Haj Bakeer Markar; that some fathers receive recognition from their sons, and some receive recognition from their fathers or mothers, but it is rare to find the son and father to be concurrently great Sri Lankan sons.
Al Haj Bakeer Markar was an accomplished parliamentarian and was truly, a dedicated representative of his people. His contribution to parliamentary activities were highlighted when the Condolence Motion was taken up in the Parliament. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted how he presided over the Parliament to create new systems to deal with the issues related to building relationships between the Executive President and the Parliament and the manner in which the responsibilities were to be discharged to Parliament by the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. Similarly there were new relations to be developed between the Judiciary and Parliament and PM Wickremesinghe stressed that at that stage Al Haj Bakeer Markars interventions were crucial. It is during his tenure the Parliamentary Consultative Committees and Public Enterprise Committee were established. All these strengthened the working of the parliamentary system. Al Haj Bakeer Markars impartiality was greatly admired at this Condolence Motion by Karunasena Kodithuwakku, WJM Loku Bandara, Chandrasiri Gajadheera et al, which was a salutation to his role as the Speaker of the House.
Al Haj Bakeer Markar, by not caring for ethnicity, race or religion received grand support from the Sinhala community than any Muslim candidate from any political group. Al Haj Bakeer Markars such commitment was well observed from the fact that he educated his son Imitiaz Bakeer Markar at Ananda College, a leading Buddhist educational institution, though he had been a teacher at Zahira College Colombo at the inception of his public career. To prove Al Haj Bakeer Markars correctness in educating his son at Ananda College, his son also excelled in debating in Sinhala, like his father, becoming a trilingual. Both of them were impartial and strived to promote harmony among all ethnic and religious groups, exhibiting productive continuity of positive constructive attitudes.
I have had an official experience with Al Haj Bakeer Markar which I may mention to prove his morals and metal in politics, which were firm and based on democratic values and tradition. On that occasion he did not want to read the Address to the Southern Provincial Council in 1994, as wished by Colombo, since it was not conventional. I along with the then Minister of Provincial Councils John Amaratunga had to be involved in a tough negotiation to adjust his stances to appease the powers in Colombo and to bring political sensitivities of non-confrontation. I believe such experiences leave great sensible and sensitive lessons to incumbent Governors for now and even for future too.
As a Muslim leader he was the Founder President of the All Ceylon Union of Muslim League Youth Fronts and the Vice President of the All Ceylon Muslim League. Further, he was the Chairman of the Beruwala Maradana Mosque Jamaath until his demise.
Al Haj Bakeer Markar served also as a Goodwill Ambassador of Sri Lanka. His close connections with the Iraqi Government enabled him to build a village in Eravur, and was the founder President of the Iraq-Sri Lanka Friendship Association and remained in this position until his demise. He was honoured and appreciated by the President of Indonesia for his assistance to Indonesians when an aircraft crashed with Indonesians on board. Thus, not only was he a son of our soil, he was also a citizen of the world.
Community development
Youth development and fostering the youth for community development and service was another aspect, which he actively promoted, and, he founded the All Ceylon Muslim Youth Front, with sincere objectives, and now, is being successfully continued by his son Imitiaz Bakeer Markar. Al Haj Bakeer Markars services also in the field of education of the Muslim Community were unique and had been appreciated even by opposing Muslim political leaders.
When all these aspects of his life is considered in a nutshell, one will observe a very wholesome life of a man who dedicated himself to the society, sans any discrimination, dedicated to politics, youth, religion, especially to the Muslim community without any problems created to other communities and also treating others as equals. Many critical socio-political issues we experience now among communities would not have subsisted if politicians followed the path treaded by Al Haj Bakeer Markar.
He imagined a world better than the one he lived in and strived to make it a reality. He could be therefore considered as an epitaph of a great personality whose principles of life should be emulated by the current leaders, especially those who try to create social commotion built on religion, ethnicity, language, regionalism, social inequality and mean economic issues. May he be remembered for all those great qualities, which should be reincarnated.
At this instance when looking back at his life and review lessons learnt, we may easily conclude that we need many more Bakeer Markars of the make of Al Haj Bakeer Markar to mount Sri Lanka as a greater nation- especially sans jealousy, strife, conflict and commotion.
At the remembrance of Al Haj Bakeer Markar, I take liberty to quote the Quran, in AL Baqarah 2.197, which says Take a provision with you for your journey. But the best provision is al- taqwa, which is piety and righteousness.
He deserves respect and honour because he was conscious and cognizant of Allah, of truth, of the rational reality- piety and fear of God. Therefore, Al Haj Bakeer Markars life was a sincere collection of al taqwa for his journey beyond this life and this world. It is very appropriate if his life is emulated by politicians, social workers and civil leaders. On a personal note I find sad is that no one from his very immediate family has committed at present to carry in similar fashion the holy voyage, which Al Haj Bakeer Markar embarked.

Giroud gets winner as France celebrate World Cup homecoming
Paris, Sunday: France finally celebrated winning the World Cup with their home fans on Sunday after Kylian Mbappe and Olivier Giroud both scored in a 2-1 win over the Netherlands in Paris.
Giroud swept in the winner from a Benjamin Mendy cross in the 75th minute for his first goal in 11 games in a France shirt, after the Chelsea striker went through the entirety of his countrys triumphant campaign in Russia without scoring.
On their first appearance on home soil since the World Cup, Mbappe had earlier put France ahead in an explosive performance from the 19-year-old, before Ryan Babel briefly restored parity in the second half.
The Stade de France exploded in celebration at Girouds winner in a game that had a competitive edge as part of UEFAs new Nations League.
However, this match on a balmy evening was really just a prelude to World Cup victory celebrations on the pitch in front of almost 80,000 fans at the national stadium after the final whistle.
The victory was the most important thing, so we can have a great party, coach Didier Deschamps told television station M6.
I am really pleased for Olivier. Strikers can have periods like that where they are not as efficient, but he is useful in our build-up play, he scored a lovely goal, and on top of that it gave us the victory.
The French team and their supporters saw this occasion as the opportunity to make up for the lack of a memorable public celebration in the immediate aftermath of the World Cup triumph in Russia.
The day after beating Croatia 4-2 in the final, Les Bleus paraded hurriedly down the Champs-Elysees Avenue in Paris en route to a reception hosted by President Emmanuel Macron.
The rushed nature of those celebrations disappointed the estimated 300,000 fans who took to the streets, and so this time the victorious squad were presented one by one to supporters after the final whistle.
The World Cup trophy was shown off as well, and the squad undertook a lap of honour, singing with supporters, at the stadium where France first won it in 1998.
Now is the time to have a party, Paul Pogba told M6.
When we came back to France it was very short. There was all the security around the bus and we couldnt really celebrate with the public.
This time we are at the Stade de France, its full, its beautiful.
The France starting line-up was the same as that in Thursdays 0-0 draw with Germany in Munich, meaning the only change from the World Cup final was in goal, with Alphonse Areola replacing the injured Hugo Lloris.
The teams were greeted by an enormous banner that read world champions and covered the pitch, before a spine-tingling version of the French national anthem.
Mbappe forced a good save from Netherlands goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen inside 50 seconds, and his performance here showed why he is tipped as a future Ballon dOr winner.
He got the breakthrough in the 14th minute as he turned in a ball driven across the box by Blaise Matuidi for his eighth international goal in 2018.
The hosts looked in complete control against a Dutch side rebuilding under Ronald Koeman after failing to qualify for Euro 2016 or the World Cup.
It took the visitors 66 minutes to seriously threaten, as Georginio Wijnaldum found himself in behind the defence only to drag his shot wide.
But the Dutch were level just a minute later, Kenny Tete delivering a cross from the right for Babel -- unmissable with his hair dyed red - to convert.
Giroud got the winner though, his 32nd for his country seeing him move one clear of Zinedine Zidanes tally for France.
After drawing in Germany, France are in control in the three-team Group 1 of League A in the Nations League, with the group winners going through to the four-team finals next June. But for them the evening was always about the post-game festivities first and foremost. AFP

Halsey plays herself in  A Star Is Born
Pop star Halsey has revealed shell appear as herself in Lady Gagas acclaimed new film A Star Is Born.
The movie premiered at the Venice International Film Festival in Italy last week and some eagle-eyed film fans spotted the Bad at Love singer.
Now Halsey, who has been linked to Bradley Coopers directorial debut for months but never officially confirmed her role, has revealed she plays herself.
I guess now is a good time to finally tell you guys that I have a little cameo in A Star Is Born! Thank you so so much to Gaga and Bradley for including me, she tweeted on September 5. It was an honor to watch both of your talent and dedication on set. an all time life highlight for me for sure.
She later added: I play myself for a very small moment! Which is insane because it means Gaga and Bradley saw me worthy of representing a piece of the current state of music in this film forever. They could have picked any artist. It was so humbling and unreal.
A Star Is Born, which is set to hit theatres on October 5, was a huge hit at Venice with critics raving about Lady Gagas portrayal of vulnerable singer Ally.
But Friday nights premiere didnt exactly go to plan - the screening was brought to an abrupt halt by a lightning strike.
The bolt reportedly struck the Lido in the Italian city, during the gala screening, and caused an outage to the power servicing the projector. Officials managed to correct the issue and the film was back on the screen after a 10 minute pause.
Cooper was heard yelling Thanks for waiting from his seat.

India set 464 to win fifth Test against England
London, Monday: India were set a huge target of 464 to win the fifth Test after England declared their second innings on 423 for eight on Mondays fourth day at the Oval. Alastair Cook made 147 in his final Test innings before international retirement and England captain Joe Root hit 125, with the pair putting on 259 for the third wicket.
Cooks innings meant he became just the fifth player in history, after Australias Reggie Duff, Bil Ponsford and Greg Chappell and Indias Mohammad Azharuddin to score hundreds in both their first and last Tests.
Both Root and Cook fell in successive balls to become debutant part-time off-spinner Hanuma Viharis first Test wickets.
The scale of the task now facing India can be seen from the fact that the most any side have made to win in the fourth innings of a Test is the West Indies 418 for seven against Australia at St Johns Antigua in 2002/03.
Indias equivalent record is the 406 for four, needing 403, they made to beat the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1975/76.

India, third largest global aviation market by 2025 - CEO Qatar Airways
Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, Akbar Al Baker, addressed key leaders in the aviation industry including government officials, airline CEOs, aviation industrialists and senior dignitaries among others, as part of the International Aviation Summit, a two-day event taking place in New Delhi, India.
Al Baker spoke at a panel discussion titled, Can India be a global aviation leader alongside Indias Minister for Commerce and Industry and Civil Aviation, Shri Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu, as well as the CEOs of KLM, Kenya Airways, Spicejet and Jet Airways. The panel discussed the aviation operating environment in India and the opportunities that exist for the market to become the third largest globally by 2025.
The International Aviation Summit in Delhi, India was organised by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) in collaboration with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to discuss the importance of the Indian aviation market, and what it will take for the aviation sector to expand in India while maximising the economic and social benefits of the potential growth.
Akbar Al Baker, said, The State of Qatar and India share a substantive and strong relationship that has evolved over the years, making India an important market for Qatar Airways. This is reflected by the 102 weekly flights we provide to 13 destinations across India.
India is on track to become the third largest global aviation market by 2025 and we are determined to further grow our presence in the Indian market by offering passengers the award-winning quality of service that they deserve. We recently launched our unique Qsuite Business Class product on the Mumbai and Bengaluru routes, to provide passengers with the best experience in the skies.
In April 2018, Indias domestic aviation market celebrated its 44th straight month of double-digit growth, and expects to celebrate the 50-month achievement of double digit growth by October 2018. Consequently, the International Aviation Summit focused on key issues that India needs to address in the future, such as airport infrastructure, capacity constraints in Mumbai and taxes to name a few, in order to sustain its linear growth.
In June 2018, Al Baker commenced his duties as the Chairman of the Board of Governors (BoG) of prestigious global aviation industry body, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), for a one-year term. Al Baker is the 77th chair of the IATA BoG. Qatar Airways currently operates 102 weekly flights between Doha and 13 destinations in India, including Ahmedabad, Amritsar, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Goa, Hyderabad, Kochi, Kolkata, Kozhikode, Mumbai, Nagpur and Thiruvananthapuram.
Qatar Airways introduced its revolutionary Qsuite Business Class services on the Mumbai and Bengaluru routes in July 2018, both of which are being served by a Boeing B777 aircraft.

Indigo attraction
It demands attention. The sitting posture and the way you hold the electric tool, all that demands mindfulness. This is not some meditation technique. It is how you engage in the encaustic art, better known as batik art.
That explains a comprehensive picture of the Galeri Batik Jawa, a collection of natural indigo batik  hand-painted batik using 100 percent natural dye from Indigofera tinctoria which yield attractive shades of blue that are applied into fashionable womens and mens wear. Dr Laretna T Adishakti is a lecturer and coordinator for the Center for Heritage Conservation, Department of Architecture & Planning, Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Gadjah Mada in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, recently held a Batik workshop to a Sri Lankan gathering. The workshop, organised by the Indonesian Embassy, provided the Sri Lankans with an opportunity try a hand on this indigenous Indonesian art.
Adishakti received her doctorate in engineering from Kyoto University (1997) while her master of architecture degree is from the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, USA (1988). Currently, she facilitates as co-founder and praesidium, Indonesian Heritage Trust; Board of Expert, Sekarjagad Batik Society, and co-founder of the Jogja Heritage Society. She is also the director, Natural Indigo Batik Research and Design, Galeri Batik Jawa Indigo Co., Ltd.
The indigo batik is used following the fermentation process of indigo leaves. It is a natural dye without any synthetic chemical, leaving no hazardous waste that could pollute soil and water, Dr Adishakti explained.
One of the oldest natural dyeing colours, Indigo has been used for well over two millennia. Also baptised as the colour of the kings as well as the king of colours, this unique colour produces a natural blue colour. The colour is unique in its own right owing to its calmness, vividness and wear-resistant capacity. It can also be combined with other natural colours to get a unique composition of colour harmony.
Anyone fond of unique handmade items and capable of appreciating its beauty will naturally fall in love with the products made of Indigo batik. The showcase of Indonesian cultural heritage at the workshop beckoned for the environmentally friendly process. The products are creatively designed and processed by hand, which is made with indigo paste and Javanese traditional patterns painted on various materials, such as cotton, silk and natural handwoven fibre with casual-contemporary style.
Galeri Batik Jawa has been in the international market since 2008 through various exhibitions, festivals and forums around the world. To meet with demands from international markets that recognizes four seasons, Indonesia produces a wide range of clothing for every season which comes with a variety of accessories, including scarves, fans, purses and bags,
Batik Indonesia has earned the reputation as UNESCO masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity. Jobja, the city where the batik has originated, is designated as World Batik City. The power of Jogja traditional pattern calls for the contemporary fashion while Galeri Batik Jawas mission stands for its achievements across the globe.
Dr Adishakti also traced the etymological roots of the word Batik. Originally termed as Pa-Tika which equals giving an order to draw or paint, it later came to be pronounced as Ba and hence batik in the east and central Java. Tika is a sacred painting on the pandanus petal, called pudak, as the media.
Batik is the Rintang Warna in Indonesian which means wax-resist dyes technique process for making designs on media by handwriting. Tulis is hand-painted by women whereas Cap stamped by men. It is Javanese traditional Batik, Dr Adishakti remarked.
The well-rooted maxim of Indonesia, Karena nila setitik rusa susu sebalenga, notes that one drop of indigo stains the whole pot of milk. It seems to be the undercurrent philosophy that dominates the Batik art. Reviving such local wisdom is instrumental in maintaining indigo as environmental friendly fashion artworks and industry.
The Batik art prevalent in Indonesia is rich in symbolism related to social status, local community, nature, history and cultural heritage. It provides Indonesian people with a sense of identity and continuity as an essential component of their life from birth to death. It contributes to ensuring the visibility of intangible cultural heritage at the local, national and international levels, raising awareness about its value and motivating the practitioners of the younger generation.
Various actors such as governmental and non-governmental institutions and community-based associations have jointly carried out safeguarding. Yogyakarta Batik maintains the authenticity of local wisdom as shown in the tradition and culture of batik and the way it used. Batik is a Rintang Warna (colour blocking) wax rest dyes technique process for making designs on media by handwriting, using canting and stamp. Batik has also been used in a life cycle of Javanese people and its performing arts. Yogyakarta continues to preserve the authenticity of batik.
Batik inherited and carried out from generation to generation (transgenerational) while using the Rintang Warna process on hand-painted stamped batik. The conversation of Yogyakarta batik has not only been in the traditional form of Jarik sarong or scarf but has also innovatively and creatively transformed into a variety of development.
The villages in Yogyakarta later became the centre of Batik, many of which have centuries of its existence. With traditional markets are scattered in the cities and villages, Yogyakarta has faced a gradual yet steady evolution. The massive expansion of the batik shops indicates the trade and home industry condition of Yogyakarta. Instead of providing for local community needs, batik is now becoming a major tourist attraction in Indonesia.

International Legal Regime on Workers Rights
Industrial relations systems are founded on a framework of labour laws which exert an influence on the nature of the industrial relations system. Employment is a matter of vital importance to a worker. Not just employment they seek but employment commensurate with his or her education, training and experience.
Workers play a significant role in the economy and unrest among workers can lead to economic difficulties. It is essential therefore for the government to address workers grievances to ensure that their rights are properly safeguarded and that unrest does not threat economic growth and stability.
International Bill of Human Rights and Workers Rights
The foundation of human rights can be considered the transformation and development of the notion of human dignity into modern social and political conditions. The human rights recognized by the international law today are the standards set out by the UN system in its various instruments.
The adoption of the United Nations Charter in 1945 marked the beginning of a new stage in international law regulation of economic, social and cultural rights (ESC Rights). The UN Charter states that one of the primary goals of the United Nations is the higher standard of living, full employment and conditions of economic and social progress and development. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted in 1948 contains an extended and specific list of ESC rights. These rights are regulated more fully in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR, 1966). Similar is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR, 1966). The above mentioned three international documents constitute the International Bill of Human Rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Article 22 provides that everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organisation and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality.
The Declaration further provides in Article 23(1) that everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment to just and favourable conditions of work and to protect against unemployment.
The Declaration recognizes that everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights accords to everyone who works.the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity. The Declaration also recognizes the right of all workers to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests and their right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay.
ICESCR
Article 6 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights expressly recognized livelihood or the right to earn a living, in the following manner 
1. The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right to work, which includes the right of everyone to the opportunity to gain his living by work which he freely chooses or accepts, and will take appropriate steps to safeguard this right.
2. The steps to be taken by a State Party to the present Covenant to achieve the full realization of this right shall include technical and vocational guidance and training programmes, policies and techniques to achieve steady economic, social and cultural development and full and productive employment under conditions safeguarding fundamental political and economic freedoms to the individual.
The Covenant also recognized the right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work which ensure, in particular remuneration which provides all workers, as a minimum, with:
(a). Fair wages and equal remuneration for work of equal value without distinction of any kind, in particular women being guaranteed conditions of work not inferior to those enjoyed by men, with equal pay for equal work;
(b). A decent living for themselves and their families in accordance with the provisions of the present Covenant.
The Covenant also guaranteed safe and healthy working conditions, equal opportunity for everyone to be promoted in his employment to an appropriate higher level, subject to no considerations other than those of seniority and competence, as well as rest, leisure and reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay, as well as remuneration for public holidays. States Parties to the Covenant also undertook to ensure the right of everyone to form trade unions and join the trade union of his choice, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, for the promotion and protection of his economic and social interests. The Covenant in Article 8 expressly provided that no restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public order or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The States Parties to the Covenant in Article 9 also recognized the right of every one to social security, including social insurance.
ILO and Workers Rights
The International Labour Organization (ILO) is one of the most important agencies of the United Nations which promotes industrial and social peace through more humane conditions of work. It was created as a tripartite body under the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 and outlived that body to become in 1946, the first specialized agency associated with the United Nations. Sri Lanka has been a member of the ILO since June 1948, shortly after gaining Independence in 1948.
The preamble to the ILO Constitution states that universal and last in peace can be established only if it is based on social justice. Its main objective, therefore, is to ensure the social and economic wellbeing of the working people all over the world and to guarantee to them dissent living standards, adequate employment opportunities and satisfactory conditions of work and pay. ILO has brought governments, employers and trade unions together for united action in the cause of social justice and better living conditions everywhere in the world on the premise, that the promotion of social justice in the field of labour could be achieved only if the social partners themselves were involved in the appropriate solutions.
The ILO engages in such activities as
* The formulation of international policies and programmes to help improve working and living conditions, enhance employment opportunities and promote basic human rights;
* The creation of international labour standards to serve as guidelines for national authorities in putting these policies into action;
* An extensive programme of international technical co-operation to help governments in making these polices effective in practice.
* Training, education, research and publishing activities to help to advance all these efforts.
International Labour Code
The values enshrined in the ILO Constitution and the declaration of Philadelphia also find expression in a body of international instruments comprising Conventions and Recommendations that together form International Labour Code.
Both Conventions and Recommendations define standards and provide a model and stimulus for national legislation and practice in member countries. The formulation and implementation of International Labour Standards and Technical Co-operation are the two principal means of action available to the ILO to make the objectivities of social justice established by its constituent bodies a reality.
Each Convention is a legal document, regulating some aspects of labour administration, social welfare or human rights. A country which has ratified a Convention must report regularly on its application in law and in practice. The ILO keeps a careful eye on the way governments carry out their obligations under the ratified Conventions. It operates two types of procedures for ensuring compliance with these Conventions: (a) procedures based on the submission of a complaint; and (b) procedures based on a regular supervision of application of a ratified Convention. International Labour Code is now a vast document, the main principles of which can only be summarised with extreme difficulty. A total of over 180 Conventions and Recommendations have been adopted so far.
By subject matter they have been broken down into 14 separate areas namely: basic human rights, employment, social policy, labour administration, labour relations, conditions of work, social security, employment of women, employment of children and young persons, old workers, migrant workers, indigenous workers and tribal peoples, workers in non-metropolitan territories and particular occupational sectors.
ILO also has attached particular importance to certain basic human rights which constitute an essential element in all actions designed to improve the conditions of workers. These are dealt with in the Conventions and Recommendations on freedom of association, freedom from forced labour and freedom from discrimination. The basic ILO Conventions on freedom of association are the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention, 1948 (No.87), and Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No.98). The forced labour Convention (1930) No.29 provides the progressive abolition of forced labour in all its forms and pending his abolition its use only for public purposes and as an exceptional measure, subject to the conditions and guarantees set out in various articles of the Convention. In 1958 the International Labour Conference adopted both a Convention (No.111) and a Recommendation (No.111), on discrimination in employment and occupation. Both instruments refer to grounds of discrimination as race, sex, or political opinion for example. They cover discriminatory laws or acts in very general terms such as any discrimination exclusion or preference which has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of treatment and which can be the result not only of legislation but also of existing factual situations or practices. They reached into all sectors of employment and occupation, public and private, and extent to vocational training and access to employment and to particular occupations as well as to conditions of employment in general. The methods proposed in these texts to combat discrimination range from direct intervention through legislation to educational activities and from action by the State to action by employers and workers organisations; individual countries are left a fairly wide margin of discretion. The ILO approach to the practical implementation of human rights is based on three guiding concepts: laying down standards by way of Conventions and Recommendations, promotional and educational activities, inquiring into complaints and practical assistance in involving in applying policy standards and procedures. The corpus jurist of social justice represented by the Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the ILO Conference constitutes a unique body of objectivities and standards, giving a precise form and context to a wide range of economic and social rights proclaimed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and embodied in the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and Economic and Cultural Rights. The ILO had promoted freedom of association, collective bargaining, equality of treatment at work and the abolition of forced and child labour as fundamental principles and rights at work over the period of time since its inspection.
Migrant workers
A number of international instruments seek to protect the rights of migrant workers. The most important among them are:
(a) ILO Convention No.97  Migration for employment (Revised) of 1949;
(b) ILO Convention No.143 on Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) of 1975;
(c) UN Convention on the Protection of Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families of 1990.
ILO Conventions No 97 contains a series of provisions designed to assist migrants for employment.
The Convention requires the ratifying States to put migrants within their territory on the same putting on their nationals in applying a wide range of laws and regulations and relating to their working life without discrimination on the grounds of nationality, race, religion or sex.
ILO Convention No.143 deals mainly with the prevention of clandestine migration for employment and arrest of man power trafficking activities.
Further, the State must declare and pursue a policy to ensure of equality of treatment in respect of matters such as employment and occupation, social security and trade unions and cultural rights.
Sri Lanka acceded to the UN Convention on the Protection of Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families of 1990 in 1996.
The main thrust of the Convention is to ensure that persons who qualify as migrant workers under its provisions are entitled to enjoy their human rights regardless of their legal status. Part VI of the Convention imposes a series of obligations on State Parties in the interest of promoting the sound, equitable, humane and lawful conditions for the international migration of workers and members of their families. These requirements include: the establishment of policies on migration; the exchange of information with other State parties; the provision of information to employers, workers and their organisations on policies, laws and regulations and assistance to migrant workers and their families.
With the constant changes in social conditions and technical knowledge, new needs arise, gaps appear, outdated rules have to be rejuvenated and new rules drawn up. It is, therefore, reasonable to expect that standard setting with regard to workers rights will continue to be an important aspect of the work of the international institutions such as UN and ILO.

Janet has  fingers crossed for Bruno  Mars  collaboration
Janet Jackson would love to team up with Bruno Mars.
The music icon revealed that she was working on new music in May and recently released a new single, Made For Now, with singer and rapper Daddy Yankee. This was the first release on Janets own label, Rhythm Nation Records, which Janet will run with her brother Randy and Cinq Music bosses Jason Peterson and Barry Daffurn, and the Nasty singer recently shared that she hoped to collaborate with the Finesse hitmaker one day.
"Bruno and I, for a while actually, weve talked about doing something together, so well see," the 52-year-old explained to Entertainment Tonight.
"I know theres this rumor going around that we have (already collaborated) and we havent. But every time we see each other we still talk about it."
Janet added that the pair plan to create something that we both feel is a part of us and that connects to both of us when they find the time to get together.
The All for You hitmaker previously shared that Bruno had a special place in my heart thanks to her 19-month-old son Eissa, who is a big fan of the Locked Out of Heaven star.
Bruno was really the first music my son responded to," she told Billboard magazine. "During and after his birth, I comforted myself with Brazilian jazz, music that always relaxes me. Then when the baby began crawling, Bruno was breaking out big and on the radio all the time. That delighted both of us.
She placed further praise on the Grammy winner when she added: Bruno is a throwback to the days when the greatest artists could do it all: write, sing, dance, produce."

JO Operation, A flop
The much bragged about Janabala Meheyuma or Operation Peoples Power (OPP) is over. Was it a success of failure Naturally opinions differ according to which side of the political divide you are. Its organizers have claimed success. Biggest ever, say some of them. It is the First Salvo in the fight for the overthrow of the Government that would certainly occur in the immediate future, much before the next Presidential or General elections, they declare.
Incidentally we have witnessed many such First Salvos from the time of the initial Nugegoda Public Rally in 2015 of the Mahinda Rajapaksa loyalists as the JO label was affixed later. It was followed by the once again announced First Salvo in the March from Kandy to Colombo. Well, many full moons have passed since then though Mahinda Rajapaksa would return to power before the following full moon. However, nature has been unsympathetic to the strong man.
Mahindage Aanduwak
Those in the Government say that the OPP was a flop. The truth seems to lie in between. However, its quality differs when seen from different perspectives. It is our belief that it should be assessed from multiple perspectives.
First let us assess it from the perspective of its mostly widespread prediction. The JO made valiant effort to convince the gullible followers that the Government would fall like a pack of cards under the tsunami of the OPP. It was said that there were also aspirants to the high office of the President of the Republic ready to assume power that night itself. Speculation was that Namal Rajapaksa or Namal Baby, as he is affectionately known in JO circles, would take reins as President! Didnt some brag that the protesters who flocked to Colombo would return to their villages under a new Government In this respect the OPP turned out to be an utter flop, a figment of the imagination of a deranged mind.
Second, consider it with respect to its numerical strength of participants. It was no doubt a significant show of strength against the Government. The numbers, however, have not reached five figures, contrary to the claims of the JO. It had a bigger visual impact due to the relatively small area covered by it for the sit-in. The city supposed to be under siege, was nevertheless more open than usual everywhere else. Have you ever heard of a siege of a city with few thousands sitting in not so strategic location leaving open all vital installations of public utilities, radio and TV stations, Centres of Governmental power, banks and vital communications and allowing free movement of goods and persons and a relaxed atmosphere It only caused a traffic diversion with no congestion at all. Even compared to a sit-in or a much smaller student demonstration at the Lipton Circus the traffic congestion was almost insignificant showing a strategic blunder in the choice of the location.
Third, from the perspective of political content it was quite poor being confined to single focus of bringing back the former regime of Mahinda Rajapaksa into power. Mahindage Aanduwak (A Mahinda Government) is all that the demonstrators clamored for. Even some JO leaders themselves have commented on the absence of any slogans on vital issues affecting the masses such as the cost of living, education, environmental concerns, poverty, malnutrition etc. In these circumstances one cannot also dismiss off-hand the allegation that it is an attempt to galvanize popular support and pressurize the Government to abandon the investigative and legal proceedings against the wrong-doers of the former regime, especially members of the Rajapaksa family.
Fourth, with respect to discipline and organisation the weakness of the OPP was deplorable. Substantial number of participants were drunk and were in a state of unconsciousness. Needless to say it was devoid of militant discipline needed for such events. The contrast could be seen when compared to the well-disciplined, highly motivated and more politically enlightened popular participation in the 1952 Hartal, which compared to its relatively fewer numbers had a more dramatic and lasting impact both momentarily and historically. At that moment it was strong enough to eject the Prime Minister from his residence to a ship in the harbour and mark the first salvo in the struggle that defeated the Government in 1956 ushering in a new era in politics.
Fifth, assessing the OPP from the perspective of its composition and potential electoral prospects a glaring deficiencies its pan-Sinhala participation. Both Sri Lankan and Up Country Tamils participants as well as Muslims were conspicuous in their absence or scant presence in numbers. The possibility of such a support being adequate to overcome the 50 percent threshold at a Presidential election is remote.
Political manifestations
Next, many people were not bothered by the OPP. He has been inflicted with political fatigue or weariness due to the deceptions forced upon him by the politicians for the last 70 years. He has actually lost faith in the political set up and is not more interested in these political manifestations.
Finally, a word should be said about the reaction of the Government. Though there were voices among the Cabinet Ministers that the Government should take a tough attitude. Unwanted attempts were made to get the Courts prohibit the protest. Fortunately, it proved futile. Freedoms of association and expression were guaranteed which saved the Government from another bad name.
However, the Government cannot be complacent. Instead of false declarations of victory, it must amend its ways and fulfill popular expectations. It must acknowledge the potential threat emanating from the OPP even with its all the above shortcomings. To be blind to see the direction in which the wind flows exposes it to the danger of being blown away when the storm arrives. Amen!

JVP to ditch 20A with new Constitution
The JVP prefers a new Constitution and is ready to abandon the 20th Amendment, if a new Constitution comes into being, JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said.
The MP was addressing a gathering in Agalawatte on Saturday at a seminar on Constitutional reforms.
The JVP organised the seminar as part of its series of seminars conducted countrywide to raise public awareness on the 20A.
He said the JVP presented the 20A to abolish the Executive Presidency because discussions relating to the new Constitution were snail-paced and seemed a distant reality.
He said if proper efforts are taken to enact a new Constitution, the JVP is prepared to abandon the 20A for a new Constitution.
TNA Spokesman M. A. Sumanthiran said during the event that Sinhala leaders, including the Ceylon Communist Party, were the ones who first advocated for a federal Constitution for Sri Lanka.
He, however, said they do not worry about labels, but only hope for meaningful power-sharing.

Kandys Esala perahera and SLs cultural transition
At twilight, a cannon shot screeches through the air. Police on horseback push back the thickening, excited crowds, clearing out the procession route. On the sidewalk, onlookers, who have been waiting for this moment since early morning, picnicking on plastic blankets to secure their coveted spots, suddenly stand up. They forget their shoes and food wrappers on the ground behind them as the sound of beating drums amplifies. A third cannon shot signals the elephants to begin their slow, consequential gait down Kandys uncommonly empty streets now glittering under thousands of tiny string lights. It is the final evening of the Randoli Perahera.
The highlight of Kandy, says the Secretary to the Lay Custodian of the Sri Dalada Maligawa, Sunil Rambukpotha, of the countrys most important perahera. The traditions of the perahera have remained largely the same - the colourfulness, the elephants, the dancers, the systems of dances, the musical instruments.
At the same time, the Kandy Esala perahera is a mixture of histories and cultures, including Sinhalese traditions, Hindu culture, and even Thai influences brought over when the king of then Siam visited during the perahera with a contingent of Buddhist monks. These ethnic variances which make Kandys perahera so unique, also reflect the cultural shifts within Sri Lanka and how the perahera has changed with the country.
In fact, the very practice of Kandys perahera is a combination of, primarily, two peraheras. The Esala peraherapre-dated the arrival of the Sacred Tooth Relic in Kandy, when farmers paid homage to the gods for rainfall during the month of Esala on the Sinhala calendar. Later, after the Sacred Tooth Relic was brought to the city in the 16th century, the Esala perahera came to include the Dalada perahera.
During the 18th century, the Sacred Tooth Relic was brought out of the Temple in its casket for all of Kandy to pay obeisance, simultaneously transforming the festival into a show of dancers, flame throwers, whip crackers, and tides of majestically dressed elephants. Legend has it that when this tradition started, the monsoons came on time.
The rains started flowing, the rivers filled up, and Sri Lanka became agriculturally self-sufficient, said Rambukpotha.
During colonial times, the British changed a key aspect of the perahera by creating the institution of a Diyawadana Nilame, the Lay Custodian of the Temple of the Tooth. The Lay Custodian is an honorary title that is given not to a monk or a king, but rather a member of the aristocracy. He is elected by the Buddhist clergy to help protect the Sacred Tooth Relic and organise Kandys annual perahera. Rambukpotha said that during the recent war, security was tightened more and more, until finally crowds diminished dramatically.
Ive been watching this perahera since I was a child, in the 1960s, and I would say that there is a decline in the crowds, the number of people who watch the perahera today, said Rambukpotha. He clarifies that this is his feeling and is not based on any formal research. He thinks the decline in crowds is particularly odd today, given the facilities that are available now. Despite the facilities, he says, the first five days of the perahera attract only small crowds. In the 60s and 70s, people came without any facilities. Rambukpotha remembers the crowds coming to watch the perahera, due, he speculates, to their faith-based enthusiasm for the festival.
Who comes to Kandys perahera today
On the final two days of the perahera, there are many tourists from abroad, including Buddhist tourists from countries like Japan and Myanmar.
I like the festival, and also, we are Buddhists, said Junesakai, a Japanese woman with her friends and relatives, who explained that they had come to the perahera, not so much as a pilgrimage, but for something like religious tourism. She remarked upon the fabulous dancing she saw and the wonder of the elephants. Junesakai said that there is nothing like the Kandy Esala perahera in Japan.
Two monks from Myanmar echoed Junesakais sentiments, saying that they hadnt experienced anything like the perahera in their predominantly Buddhist country either. Other Buddhist countries are different. Its very interesting, said 30-year-old Sundaranyana. These monks had made the journey from Myanmar to be at the perahera specifically because of the Sacred Tooth Relic. Being near the Buddha in this way, said Sundaranyana, is very important in a Buddhists life.
Others, like a group of three young women from England and Scotland, came to be at the perahera serendipitously: We didnt know about the perahera, we just stumbled upon it. Its cool! Amazing, they said.
Still more came from Sri Lankan cities. Like 36-year-old Sandaruwan who came from Colombo. Its our tradition, he said, explaining that he had come, to protect this place, and of course the perahera, because of course, this perahera is a mirror of our proud history.
The perahera attracted Sri Lankans near and far, even members of the Sri Lankan diaspora, like 32-year-old Guri, who lives in New York, but visits Kandy regularly. She says, I like to be here for the perahera. This is a very important tradition for the Sri Lankan people.
And yet, speaking with the Daily News, none of these onlookers could explain the peraheras rich symbolism or historical significance. A fact which may be best summed up by 17-year-old Kavisha from Kalutara, who said that the perahera means our religious culture. Elephants, she mused, symbolise our Buddhist culture.
Old traditions in a modern world
Today, one of the challenges that the Diyawadana Nilame (Lay Custodian) Pradeep Nilanga Dela faces is to make ancient rituals relevant. We want to update our standards from the ancient times, said the Diyawadana Nilame. His private secretary also credits the Diyawadana Nilame with having streamlined the peraheras logistics.
Yet another way that the Diyawadana Nilame has sought to keep these ancient traditions within the modern context is by offering further education for the peraheras dancers. I have decided to start an academy for the dancers, he says. The academy will reside within the Sri Lanka International Buddhist Academy in Pallekele. In that academy we will offer diploma courses, then allow them to sit for the degree. The Diyawadana Nilame guesses that at present only 10-15 percent of the dancers have formal degrees because traditionally, the dancers were part of a rigid caste system that steered them away from formal education.
Another obstacle that todays Diyawadana Nilame faces is confronting contemporary challenges to old traditions such as the use of elephants at the perahera.
The Diyawadana Nilame is himself an elephant owner, and his personal experiences with elephants makes him extremely sceptical of the contemporary criticisms launched at the ritual.
Now Western countries are criticising us about the treatment of elephants. But a lot of NGOs are making money off this issue, he said. The Diyawadana Nilame also argued that British colonisers came to Sri Lanka and hunted elephants.
He said this in explanation as to why outsiders should have no say in the treatment of elephants in Sri Lanka. In ancient times, there were more elephants, and to use them is our culture, our tradition. We want to preserve it.
Instead, he laments, We need more elephants. Even though, of the less than 100 elephants in captivity in Sri Lanka, every year about 80 percent are used in the Kandy perahera.
Kandys perahera in transition
On the final evening of festivities, the Randoli perahera, a captive audience was packed person to person and pressed against the iron bars surrounding the Temple. Behind them, a white building sits unobtrusively over the Kandy Lake, where the queens of the Kandyan Kingdom once watched the perahera from their balcony.
Randoli is translated as queens palanquin. In the Kandyan Kingdom, queens in their palanquins were carried alongside the elephants in the perahera, until 1775, (according to M.B. Dassanayakes The Kandy Esala Perahera), when King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe decreed that palanquins should be put at the end of the perahera, because women could not be permitted to travel alongside the Sacred Tooth Relic.
It is yet another example of how the perahera has historically adapted to the social context in which it exists. Despite its historicity and prominence, which makes the Kandy Esala perahera a singular event in the country, old traditions and culture tend to accommodate the present moment.
As foreigners and Sri Lankan nationals alike pressed their faces between the bars of the Temple fence, waiting eagerly for the procession of elephants, dancers, and finally the Sacred Tooth Relic to come down the road, it seemed like another moment of transition was in store for the perahera.

The knowhow path to Sri Lankan development
When Adam Smith wrote The Wealth of Nations in 1776, the richest country in the world was four times richer than the poorest one. Today, Singapore is over 110 times richer than Burundi. What could possibly explain such an extreme divergence of the wealth of nations Economists have shown that these differences are too large to be explained by differences in the availability of land or capital  including human capital. So, they ascribe it to differences in the productivity with which land and capital are used, something that economists attribute to technology. But what is technology and why does it differ across countries
Technology really is composed of three elements: tools, codes and knowhow. Tools embody the knowledge of how they were made. They exist in three-dimensional space. Codes include recipes, protocols, routines and how-to-do manuals. They codify the knowledge about making things in the form of instructions to potential implementers, just as cookbooks do. Codes exist in a symbolic space in the sense that they mean the same thing whether they are implemented as ink over paper or as letters on a screen. Tools can be shipped anywhere in the world and codes can be put on the web, making them available pretty much everywhere. So why do such large differences in productivity and technology persist
Implementing technology requires not just tools and codes but also knowhow. To play a violin sonata you need a violin, which is a tool and you need the music score, which is a code, but you also need to know how to read the notes and how to play the instrument. That is what we call knowhow. It exists only in brains and gets there through a long process of imitation and repetition. It takes many years to become a master violin player. Knowhow is tacit, meaning that it is hard to transmit. You do not learn it by just hearing somebody speak about it.
Tools, codes and knowhow are complements: you need all three. If you do not know how to play the violin, you cannot compensate the problem by using more violins or music scores. Because of its reliance on knowhow, technology moves across geography only with difficulty and it is much easier to move brains than it is to move knowhow into brains. Moreover, it is not just individual knowhow that matters. Many technologies cannot be implemented by individuals: they require coherent teams. A violinist may play a violin sonata, but he cannot, on his own, play a symphony. He requires many other musicians that are competent in different instruments.
Having more technology means having more tools, codes and knowhow, but the hardest to accumulate is the knowhow. And knowhow does not grow because musicians individually learn how to play more instruments. It is because different musicians learn how to play different instruments. In other words, societies know more because individuals know different. Hence, accumulation of knowhow at the level of the society requires the division or diversification of knowhow across individuals.
This diversification of knowhow has two consequences. First, more knowhow means that societies would have what it takes to know how to make more things, meaning that production can become more diversified. Second, having more knowhow also means that societies can also make more knowhow-intensive products: things whose production requires larger and more diverse teams.
How does diversification happen
If a society accumulates knowhow it will be able to do things it was not doing before, that is it would diversify its production. But this faces a chicken and egg problem. You cannot do the things you do not know how to do but you do not know how to do the things you do not do. For example, if a country would like to start producing watches, it will need watchmakers. But if it doesnt produce watches, it will not have any watchmakers - it will have to train watchmakers. But who will train the watchmakers if there are no watchmakers to begin with This type of problem is ubiquitous when it comes to economic diversification and limits the speed and scope at which it can take place. The good news is that there are solutions.
As knowhow resides in brains, the movement of knowhow happens through the mobility of the brains that hold it. This happens at all scales. It happens between firms in a city. In the heydays of automotive industry in Detroit, Michigan, almost half of the over one hundred new auto firms were spin-offs from existing companies, as employees that learned how to do things in one firm moved to found other firms. Similar is the case of the Silicon Valley, where many semi-conductor companies are spinoffs of a single parent company  Fairchild Semi-conductors, itself a spin-off from Bell Labs.
It also happens between regions of a country. In research with Frank Neffke we documented that the firms that diversified East Germany after reunification hired experienced workers from West Germany and firms that diversify regions of Sweden are founded by entrepreneurs that come from outside the region or by multi-plant forms that are headquartered outside of their region. And it happens also between countries through migration, diaspora networks and foreign direct investment.
Starting in the 1960s, Singapore opened up both to foreigners and to multinationals. Today, 46% of Singapores population is foreign-born. Over the last 20 years, Singapores annual FDI inflows have averaged 18% of its GDP. Today the purchasing power of Singapores GDP per capitais seven times that of Sri Lanka, although at its founding in 1965 Singapore looked up to Sri Lanka. By contrast, only 0.1% of the Sri Lankan population is foreign born and FDI has averaged about 1% of GDP.
In addition to migration and FDI there are diaspora networks and return migration. Members of a countrys diaspora often acquire knowhow in their host country that they can transfer to their home country under the right circumstances. Return migration of US educated engineers to Taiwan and Korea played a key role in the development of the ICT industries in this region and overseas Chinese played a key role in the development of China once it opened up to FDI in 1978. They brought along knowledge, capital and connections from the worlds most advanced places. Several cities in India, most prominently Bangalore and Hyderabad, managed to become world-class IT centres by leveraging the Indian diaspora in the US and the returning diaspora. Today, Indias ICT service exports are 5% of its GDP, while those of Sri Lanka are only 1% of GDP, even after the end of the civil war.
These channels have all played a role in Sri Lankas past growth as well. The rubber tyre sector was pioneered by an immigrant from Belgium, for example. In the garment sector, todays two largest exporters were started by descendents of immigrants from Gujarat and in general most of the largest post-liberalization companies started as joint ventures or FDI. Finally, the rapidly-growing IT sector is bolstered by the connections that Sri Lankan entrepreneurs made while living in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. Yet in spite of their transformational impact in the past, there remain significant barriers and disincentives to immigration, return migration and FDI in Sri Lanka today.
Attracting knowhow into Sri Lanka
Going forward, it is critical that Sri Lanka harnesses these three knowhow channels. Sri Lankas economic growth is constrained by the weak growth of exports, particularly from new sectors. In the last 25 years, Sri Lanka has seen virtually no new export products, especially in manufactured goods. This is in contrast with other countries in the region such as Thailand, China, and Vietnam, where new product lines contribute significantly to the increase in overall exports. While Sri Lanka is still mainly exporting garments and traditional agricultural products, the other countries moved onto electronics and machinery. As a result, Sri Lankan exports have not been keeping up with the pace of economic growth, leading to widening of the current account deficits that ultimately cause growth to stall.
But Sri Lanka can change this by enhancing the inflow of knowhow from abroad and it has several policies it can adopt. One of these is immigration policy. The current immigration system makes it difficult for Sri Lankan firms to hire foreign professionals. It also makes it nearly impossible for potential new entrepreneurs to migrate into the country to establish new firms. In a six-country comparison of Asian countries, a recent Harvard CID study showed how restrictive the current policy regime is in Sri Lanka. The study found that while other countries are transitioning from systems that just authorize immigration to those that promote it selectively, Sri Lanka has restrictions galore including no path to permanent residency or citizenship, a feature that is quite unique. Singapore, for example, offers a variety of visa categories for key economic actors such as investors, entrepreneurs and start-up talent. It also offers a variety of visa categories for people with different levels of skills and economic roles, from the highly skilled to domestic servants. It offers the possibility for workers dependents to seek employment as well as paths to permanent residency and citizenship. As a result, foreigners there have high incentives to consider migrating to the country and once there, to integrate and to invest in the future of Singapore.
Sri Lanka is very far from these practices. True, the Board of Investment (BOI) makes it easier for BOI firms to hire foreign employees, but other immigration regulations make Sri Lanka a less attractive work destination; spouses of foreigners need ministerial-level permission to work in Sri Lanka; foreign experts are not allowed to move across firms, as visas are specific to an employment relationship; and they cannot aspire to permanent residence, let alone citizenship. For non-BOI firms, which are the overwhelming majority of Sri Lankan companies, hiring foreign experts is much harder.
One hurdle facing many worker visa applications is obtaining approval from the corresponding national association for the profession. These associations have often worked on the assumption that businesses might use foreigners to substitute for local professionals and hence lower their wages or employment prospects. But this assumes that foreign professionals are substitutes rather than complements of local talent. Substitutes are things like tea and coffee. The more tea you have, the less coffee you want. Complements are things like tea and sugar; the more tea you have, the more sugar you want. In research studies that Harvard CID has carried out not only in Sri Lanka but also in several countries including Panama, Mexico, Albania, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, we have found that foreigners, especially skilled ones, are strong complements, not substitutes of locals, meaning that a greater employment of foreigners increases the employment and wages of locals. Moreover, the effects are not just limited to the expansion of the industry that hires the immigrant: there are important multiplier effects on the whole local economy with employment multipliers  that is local jobs created per immigrant  estimated between two and four. One study for the U.S. estimated that every foreign-born worker with a Science Technology Engineering or Math (STEM) degree creates 2.6 jobs for U.S.-born workers. And since these are good jobs that pay high wages, their growth also increases the demand for non-tradable domestic services. By contrast, immigration restrictions tend to create artificial skills shortages that prevent industries from expanding and hiring more locals.
Some argue that Sri Lanka cannot open up to more high-skilled immigration because it does not have the right institutions that would evaluate the qualifications of foreign nationals. This argument is bogus, because no country really does. Licensing of sensitive professions such as medicine or law is a process that is independent of the immigration status of the person under consideration. If Sri Lanka were to admit graduates from any university that is better ranked than the best ranked Sri Lankan university, this should allay any fears of inadequate foreign training.
While the current migration policies are bad in general for Sri Lanka, they are particularly catastrophic for diversification, as immigration is key to solving chicken and egg problems. To put it bluntly, if the United States had Sri Lankan immigration policies, Silicon Valley would not exist, given that 57% of its STEM workers are foreign born. Another 25% come from states other than California. Only 18% were born in California, which is a state with twice the population of Sri Lanka (and the U.S. population is 15 times that of Sri Lanka).
It is clear that Sri Lankas current economic structure  and the underlying knowhow  is inadequate to propel the society forward. Some Sri Lankans wish that their country would become a trading and services hub for the Indian Ocean, or a high-tech manufacturer connected to many global value chains, or an incubator of some of the worlds next high-tech unicorns. Each of these visions is possible, but not if the country tries to do it alone.
No economy can achieve such a transformation using only the knowhow of the citizens who have never ventured past its borders. The successful economies enhance their capabilities by attracting the missing sugar that can enhance the tea; that is, they work to integrate foreign migrants and their own diaspora into their societies. Rather than fearing foreigners, they develop an attitude of pride in the fact that people born elsewhere want to become part of them. This is a path that is open to Sri Lanka. But as all paths, it does not get you anywhere unless you take it.

LankaeNews Editor yet to receive summons
The Supreme Court was informed yesterday, that summons had not been served on LankaeNews Editor Sandaruwan Senadheera, in connection with several contempt of court cases filed against him.
The Supreme Court was informed that measures had been taken to serve summons on Senadheera through the Foreign Ministry.
Fourteen contempt of court applications for allegedly publishing defamatory articles on Apex Court as well as Magistrates Court judges, were fixed for February 28, 2019.
On January 19, 2016, two persons including Sandaruwan Senadheera, were ordered to appear before the Supreme Court on March 3, the same year. However, the second accused, an Attorney-at-Law, was present in court.

The complainant said that the LankaeNews website was owned and maintained by Sandaruwan Senadheera from London, United Kingdom.

Lavigne to release  long-awaited music
Avril Lavigne is finally ready to return to the charts with the release of her first song from her long-awaited new album later this month.
The Complicated singer hasnt released any new music since 2015, the same year she went public with her battle with Lyme disease, and although she has kept largely out of the spotlight, she has continued to work on her sixth studio project while battling the illness.
Now Avril has announced the wait is over - Head Above Water will be out on 19 September.
I spent the last few years at home sick fighting Lyme Disease, she writes in a lengthy statement on her website. Those were the worst years of my life as I went through both physical and emotional battles. I was able to turn that fight into music Im really proud of... Truly... by keeping my spirits up, having goals to reach and a purpose to live for, my music helped to heal me and keep me alive...
Avril goes on to thank her fans for being patient and reveals she wrote the lead single when she was convinced she was going to succumb to her illness.
It is also the first song I wrote from my bed during one of the scariest moments of my life, she adds. I had accepted death and could feel my body shutting down. I felt like I was drowning. Like I was going under water and I just needed to come up for air... Praying to God for Him to help me just keep my head above the water... I grew closer to Him. My mother held me. In her arms, I wrote the first song that I am releasing to tell my story...
The 33-year-old also reveals she is ready to be truthful about her health struggle because she wants to raise awareness for other people who are battling the disease through the work of her charity, The Avril Lavigne Foundation.
Im taking my life back into my own hands and doing what it is I know I am meant to be doing in this life time, she continues. Making music. And sharing my healing and hope, through my music. I wish for this all to touch you, to bring you strength, to lift you up, to inspire and to encourage you...

Leading sports PR guru Mike Lee dies
London, Monday: Mike Lee, who established sports public relations giant VERO Communications and masterminded campaigns such as Qatars stunning victory to host the 2022 World Cup, has died of a heart attack aged 61, the company announced Monday.
Lee -- who leaves a widow, Heather, a son Alex and a stepson Euan -- had forged a successful career in the sporting world with a succession of highs leading to VEROs creation.
Having been UEFAs director of communications, he enjoyed perhaps his greatest moment in the same role for Londons successful 2012 Olympic bid when they upset favourites Paris.
Lee, though, was to enjoy his own moment of success with Paris as VERO advised them on their bid for the 2024 Games -- the only other bidders Los Angeles were eventually awarded rights to stage the 2028 Games.
It is with enormous sadness that the Lee family and VERO Communications announce that Mike Lee passed away on Saturday (8 September) at the age of 61 from a heart attack, read the statement from VERO.
Lee set up VERO in 2006 and amongst its successes aside from Qatars World Cup triumph he could count Pyeongchangs winning the right to host the 2018 Winter Olympics, Rios 2016 Summer Games victory and the inclusion of rugby and surfing in the Games. AFP

Lego builds a Bugatti Chiron
With Lego Technic you can build for real, the Danish toy company announced. And they mean it.
To back their powerful words they created a full-scale, drivable replica of the $3,000,000 Bugatti Chiron, and its probably the coolest Lego creation ever.
In total, over 1 million Lego Technic pieces were used, adding to a weight of 1,500 kg (about 3,300 lbs). There were 13,400 man-hours put into the replica, with the most impressive aspect of the car sitting under the hood. 2,304 Lego Power Functions motors were put together, generating about 5,3 horsepower that could allow the vehicle to hit about 18 miles per hour.
Months of development and testing came to a head in June on the Ehra Lessien test track outside Wolfsburg, Germany  the same track where the original Bugatti Chiron was tested  when we found out if the car would actually drive, Lego wrote.
We were even more excited when Bugattis official test driver and former Le Mans winner, Andy Wallace, agreed to test drive the Technic version of the Chiron on its first drive.

Lipstick sculptures
Naturally, we love anything and everything that has to do with lipstick. So when we came across the Hong Kongbased multimedia artist May Sum and her amazing collection of handmade lipstick sculptures, which she sells in her Etsy shop wahahafactory (among other works), we had to share it with you.
After graduating from City Universitys Creative Media department and a fan of beauty and fashion, Sum went on to work as a beauty reporter for a magazine and built a portfolio in makeup and art direction. When the publication she was working for closed down, she was asked to work as a freelance makeup artist, which ultimately led her to explore her other artistic talents.
Sum was able to turn her love of fashion, beauty, and the icons of those industries into 3D carved sculptures made out of actual lipstick. And not every tube is sturdy and stable enough to work as Sums canvas. She only uses lippies from NARS, MAC, Este Lauder, YSL, and Max Factor. Sum has sculpted everyone from Anna Wintour and Kate Moss to Lady Gaga and Marilyn Monroe.
And it isnt just celebs that Sum sculpts-she also takes custom orders. She can make a lipstick likeness from almost any photo you send her, with the exception of those that are too detailed; some things are impossible to sculpt in lipstick, she says.
Each of Sums lipstick sculptures takes approximately two weeks to design, and she always warns customers not to expect perfection since each one is in fact, hand crafted. (Though, we were pretty blown away by how detailed her Greek mythology carvings came out on tubes of cream bronzer.) Perfection or not, this is some of the most impressive and original artwork weve seen. Clearly, others feel the same, too. Each sculpture sells from upwards of $400-$600, which is quite the business, considering most of the lipstick she uses to sculpt, costs no more than $40. But the time, focus, and detail that goes into each and every one of her carvings, makes the money worth it to her loyal fans. But Sum isnt in it just for the profit. During her 2012 art exhibit in Shanghais Wheelock Square, she hosted an event in hopes of encouraging people to use makeup as a way to help realize their personal and professional dreams.
Seems like Sum believes makeup can help enhance your true beauty inside and out-and we couldnt agree more.

Magical moggy with the balancing act
An adorable cat has proven an internet hit with his seemingly magical ability to balance dice on its paws.
The moggy is filmed standing perfectly still as it balances nine precariously-placed dice on its paw. It looks completely nonplussed as the owner stacks more and more.
But its not just dice where the moggy proves a magician - it also manages to hold a stack of cards between its paws.
The owner has placed what appears to be a card pyramid between the cats legs - which the feline holds in place while leaning back.
In another video the cat holds a full deck of spade playing cards while his owner stacks dice on its other paw.
In typical cat-fashion the animal looks distinctly nonchalant as the owner puts seven dice on the edge of its paw.
In fact, it looks like its about to fall asleep.
Its unclear where exactly the footage was originally shot, but it was first uploaded on Chinese social media.
The cat has proven a popular viral hit on image hosting and social media sites. Bibi now holds the World Record for the most dice balanced on a cats paw!

Maradona: playing genius but coaching misfit
BUENOS AIRES, Sunday - As much as he was a genius with the ball at his feet, Diego Maradona's coaching career has been far from distinguished and took a curious turn when he joined Mexican second-division outfit Dorados.
The man who led Argentina to just their second World Cup crown -- according to many almost single-handedly -- and whose brilliance inspired Napoli to the only two Serie A titles in their history, has ploughed a less succesful coaching furrow.
With a cultured left foot and mesmerising dribbles he was twice signed for a world record fee, first by Barcelona and then Napoli.
He played for some of Argentina's biggest and most prestigious clubs: Boca Juniors, Newell's Old Boys and Argentinos Juniors, while also representing his country 91 times and scoring 34 goals."If I die, I want to be born again and play football to give the people joy," he once said.
Father time has long caught up with the 57-year-old, though, as he wryly notes: "I have shorter legs than a picture frame, if I want to train I get torn all the way up to the shoulders."
After the glittering playing highs, his coaching career, barring a two-year stint in charge of the Argentine national team, has been largely spent far away from the glitz and glamour.
UNMITIGATED FAILURES
This is not the first time he's taken charge of a second-division side -- he left Al Fujairah of the United Arab Emirates in May after failing to guide them to promotion despite seven wins in 11 matches. Other spells at Deportivo Mandiyu and Racing Club in Argentina and UAE's Al Wasl were unmitigated failures.
During the first two, from 1994-95, he won a combined three out of 23 matches and subsequently resumed his playing career, albeit briefly.
In this latest quest he can only improve the team's performances given they have yet to win a game this season.
The club's fans seem unperturbed by his poor coaching record, with one holding up a placard proclaiming: "Welcome Golden God!" as Maradona arrived at the Culiacan airport on Saturday.
One teenage fan, Bryan Felix, has faith that even at 57, Maradona can still improve.
"His other coaching experiences weren't good but that's the same for other coaches when they started," he said.
Maradona's first coaching experience was five years before Felix was even born.
Dorados president Jose Antonio Nunez is another beating the same drum, attempting to find a positive twist on his high-profile signing's record.
"He knows what it's like to start from the bottom, he knows the value of a lower league," he said.
'HAPPY MEMORIES'
Maradona has a special affinity for Mexico as it was there that he enjoyed his finest hour, leading Argentina to a 3-2 victory over West Germany in the 1986 World Cup final.
At the weekend he wrote on Instagram that he was "happy to return to the land where I was world champion and where I retain very happy memories".
He will do so while retaining his other official positon, as honorary president of Belarusian outfit Dinamo Brest, a post he only took up in July, but to great fanfare as he was paraded around town to cheering crowds and given a diamond ring.
That would have come in handy for someone who has suffered financial difficulties in recent times, not least with a multi-million euro unpaid Italian tax bill hanging over his head.
It might explain his need to take up a coaching position in such a relative backwater.
It's also an ideological fit for a man who was friends with two of Latin America's most famous socialist leaders: Cuba's Fidel Castro and Hugo Chaves of Venezuela, and sports a tattoo of revolutionary icon Che Guevara.

Mehta to adapt Funny Boy on screen
Filmmaker Deepa Mehta's next film is an adaptation of Sri Lankan-Canadian novelist Shyam Selvadurai's "Funny Boy".
First published in 1994, the book chronicles six poignant stories of a boy coming to age within a wealthy Tamil family in Colombo.
Between the ages of seven and fourteen, he explores his sexual identity, and encounters the Sinhala-Tamil tensions leading up to the 1983 riots.
"I am going to start shooting for a film from January called 'Funny Boy'. It's based on Shyam Selvadurai's book. It's a really lovely, coming-of-age story with a Sri Lankan setting," Mehta said.
The director, whose previous works like "Earth" and "Midnights Children" were also book adaptations, said it's hard for her not to visualise books cinematically while she's reading.
"I love adapting books. There are some books which are cinematic and there are some which aren't. When I read a book, I keep visualising it. Words come to life, you form images and sometimes I can even see who's acting in it.
The Indo-Canadian filmmaker swears by Tony Morrisons famous quote, All art is political and says artistes across the world will always fight for freedom of expression, trying not to succumb to self-censorship.
Artistes will always fight for freedom of expression. When a time comes when there is no strife then we forget how important freedom of expression is. It is only when you fight for something that you realise its importance. The fight may probably never end, Mehta told PTI.
While artistes can put up a fight to voice what they feel through their art, there could also be a looming fear in doing so.
You can get scared, depending on the climate. You have to be aware. But I think there is something really tragic about self-censorship. I am not an advocate of that. But, it (art) is not made for the sake of making trouble. Nobody goes out and says I will make a statement which will court problems and get me in a controversy. That defeats the purpose, Mehta adds.

Melodies on the move
Pasan Liyanage is one of the leading music producers in Sri Lanka. With a passion for music ever since he was a teenager, Liyanage is one of the most sought after producers in the country. Melodies speaks to Liyanage about his passion.
Just after my A/Ls I joined with Hit Factory Studios (Ranga D). Then I left Hit Factory 5 years ago and started my own company called Redfox. Im really happy and feel so lucky to be a music producer, I dont feel like Im doing a job because its kind of fun to make different types of music for different clients. And since Im doing so much of TV commercials and radio commercials, for me its like Im living in another world when I enter the studio, and when I do music it is an awesome feeling. Im like super into it. I think its not always about the money its about giving a good product to your client which that person will be satisfied with, said Liyanage
He also commented that there are challenges out there and that the industry is pretty demanding and tough
Well its a very competitive industry because you always have to stay up to date when it comes to music and technology and the quality of the sounds. But at the end of the day its what you do and what you are good at, stated Liyanage.
Liyanage was open to all kinds of music as a teenager. He took an interest in music and by now has an all -round knowledge of music.
Since I was in grade seven in school, I used to listen every genre of music and used to play those songs on my small keyboard. So after that I did my theory in western music, and would like to thank all my teachers because I am where I am now because of them. I came up with some hits like surangani and athamita kazi. I have already made so many hits then to now and people love it. And Im not a producer who sticks to one style, I keep on changing and that keep me going everyday, pointed out Liyanage
He has worked with the crme of Sri Lankan music. The big names such as Bachi Susan, BnS, Ranidu, Iraj, Ashanthi, Natasha Rathnayake, Nadeemal Perera, ADK, Vijay Anthony, Sanuka, Tehani and many more
Having made a name for himself and carved a niche in the music industry, his company REDFOX has a special place in his heart.
Here Im with Redfox (PVT) Ltd and Redfox Records. Some highlights of my career have been winning the best Electro music producer and the best producer award at Yes FM home grown music awards. Some of my hit songs like Surangani, Ashawari, Visekari and Maath mage hitha keep my brand always up, explained Liyanage.
Liyanage has many goals and ambitions in life and his dreams are backed up with his skill.
Well there goals such as selling audio equipment, get more artists to the Redfox and release their tracks on my channel, and our own online apps, said Liyanage
Liyanages message for young people who want to be producers is to explore the industry and field as much as possible. His advice is to make it a passion.
If you have a dream to be a producer you should never stick to one style you should listen to every genre and to get that exact quality sound. You have to work day and night and once you are on the right track you wont feel like you are doing a job because it will be like a hobby. Make sure you give the best product for your client for a reasonable price and make sure you are always up to date with everything, explained Liyanage.
Liyanage points out that the greatest person he has worked with is Ranga Dasanayake and that he has learnt a lot from him.
I want to thank my parents in life, they supported my dream and they never let me down or forced me to do anything else. I would like to thank Ranga D as well, because he is the one who taught me how to keep my standard and all. We dont live for a long time so we have to do everything during the little time we have and make the maximum out of it. So I always think- how I can keep my fans happy and make my band great
To make a hit, the music and lyrics should be powerful so I give my full 100 percent. But if the lyricist or the vocalist cant do his job properly it will be a failure because you cant expect music to cover all those sections. The artiste should give his fullest support to the product to get a good output, summed up Liyanage.

Minister Fonseka criticises Army Commander
Field Marshal and Wild Life Minister Sarath Fonseka yesterday slammed the incumbent Army Commander for acting in an arbitrary manner.
He said that the strength of the Army has been reduced under the leadership of the present Army Commander.
Fonseka added that national security is at stake as the Army Commander has failed to provide accurate information to the authorities concerned.
Minister Fonseka was addressing the media after an event in Gampaha.
Meanwhile the Sri Lanka Army issuing a lengthy statement on Sunday said that some retired Army Officers have alleged that they are not happy with the battle alertness of the Army at present.
Excerpts from the statement: "It is not only ethically right for someone to review the status quo of the Army and its battlefield preparedness from outside after having gone on retirement years ago, but it also does question someones moral right to hurl such allegations.
It is pointed out that the Sri Lanka Army with the dedicated objective of strengthening it self when necessary has consulted former Commanders and retired Officers with battle-hardened experience with good faith and the Army would continue such practices unfailingly in future, too.
"The Sri Lanka Army strongly condemns such criticisms, attributed to the government, Ministry of Defence and the command of the Army and appeals to the intelligent people of this country, regardless of rhetoric of such opportunists, to repose the confidence in the Army which has defended our country in the past, and is committed to do so in future, too as a professional outfit, taking all measures to prevent any resurgence of warfare," the Army statement added.

Mistakes to avoid while applying make-up
Make-up can be your best friend or your worst enemy, depending on how you use it. Find the right blush for your skin tone, dont wear waterproof mascara daily and dont go overboard with your love for matching your outfit, suggest experts.
Make-up artiste Mouna Lall, and Jason Arland, senior manager at Artistry, have listed dos and donts of make-up:
. The biggest mistake is not using a moisturising cream. One must wash and apply a cream or moisturiser depending on the skin type at least 15 minutes before pruning the skin.
. Always use a primer which helps the foundation to have a smooth surface to settle on. This makes make-up last long.
. If you have dry skin, any kind of moisturiser can be used where as if you have an oily skin then only water based foundations should be used.
. It is important to know how to apply foundation. We make big mistakes like using both our hands and rubbing it away instead of tapping and placing it on the skin with two fingers or a brush.
. Confusing correctors and concealers is a major confusion people often have. Correctors are for correcting ones skin tone whereas concealers will conceal the corrector and foundation, giving an even skin tone.
. Use a fine mineralised powder just to set the make-up base to avoid a heavy cakey face as the natural make-up look is in fashion.
. Matching same colour eyeshadow, lipstick and nail polish with clothes is a big no as the look becomes one-dimensional and is not appealing to the eyes. If you wear a pink outfit with gold work, then the eyes can be brown gold or smokey with only lipstick the dress.
. Heavy punched in the face kind of smokey eyes is a big turnoff. Blend it well.
. Go for a blush that is closest to your skin tone. Fair and medium skinned people can try the rosy pink and peaches. Nude, red and brown coloured blush look best on people with dusky and deeper skin tones.
. Using same colour lip liner all over the lips and following with lipstick is important for the lipstick to have a long stay and not leave a line after a while.
. Waterproof mascara is amazing, but not always. The water-resistant formula can dry out your lashes causing them to break easily. Also, removing the waterproof mascara takes a whole of effort which can again damage your lashes. Keep it reserved for weddings and parties.
. Dump all the products that have crossed their expiry date. Old and expired products are not safe to use and can lead rashes, allergies and irritation.

Namal should give his MP post to IUSF Convener - Deputy Minister Bandara
Joint Opposition MP Namal Rajapaksa who failed to effectively organise the recent Jana Balaya Kolabata protest should consider giving his MP post to Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) Convener Lahiru Weerasekera who does a better job than Rajapaksa, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said yesterday.
Deputy Minister Bandara, together with Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando and MP Mujibar Rahuman made this observation at a press brief held at the Sirikotha UNP Headquarters in yesterday.
As the saying goes, give your post to Lahiru. Lahiru does a better job with just 500 students what Namal couldnt do with the protesters who were brought in. The JO rally organisers wanted to surround important places like the Presidents House, the Supreme Court, the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Cooperation and so on. But we made sure that they wont be able to do any of that. The Police and the intelligence units should be given full credit for tactically managing the situation, Bandara said.
Deputy Minister Bandara also observed that senior Joint Opposition members are unhappy with the failure to properly organise an effective protest.
MP Namal Rajapaksa who was responsible for organising the rally has not sought any advice from the senior JO members, Bandara also said.
The Deputy Minister said that it very well shows the immaturity of MP Namal as a young politician.
On the same subject, Minister Harin Fernando said that they are thankful to MP Namal Rajapaksa creating a rift in the Joint Opposition.
That is exactly what we were not able to do, but he did it for us. With all the cheap moves, Namal failed to organise the rally. Namal should take the responsibility of his failure without trying to put the blame on us. We are ready for any kind of investigation, Minister Fernando said.
He also condemned the allegation made by the JO members that MP Mujibar Rahuman was seen drunk.
MP Mujibar Rahuman said that the JOs Arabic Spring turned into an Arrack Spring at the end of the rally.
He also said that Social Media properly portrayed the failure of the JOs rally.
When the Student Unions protest, they know what they are doing at least. They know how to create a clash with the Police. They purposefully get beaten by the Police and leave promising to come back. They have that moral. These frustrated protestors left the protest scene a defeated lot, he pointed out.
Minister Fernando observed that some Joint Opposition MPs had booked hotel rooms in luxury hotels while the protesters had to rough it out on the street.
Maybe they were planning to stay in Colombo for a while. Initially, they were talking of protesting for three to four days until the government was toppled. Maybe they were planning to take oaths as ministers in the government they were planning to establish, hence booking FIve Star hotel rooms to keep their belongings, Minister Fernando observed.
He also said that spreading hate speech on social media will not be allowed or tolerated by the government.

Panasian Power Group posts Rs 152 mn PAT in 2017/18
Panasian Power (the Company) and Group posted a profit of Rs 54 million and Rs 152 million respectively during the financial year -2017/2018, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the company, Dr Prathap Ramanujam told shareholders of the company in its latest annual report.
Accordingly, during the period under review, the Group has recorded a profit after tax growth of 620 percent amounting to Rs. 152 million. In addition, operational excellence, plant productivity focus and prudent cost efficiencies attributed further in expanding the profit margin to 32 percent. However, net finance cost has increased by 26 percent YoY due to additional debt funding of Rs 700 million.
The loan was mainly utilized to finance the acquisitions and carry out the construction work of Padiyapelella Hydropower Limited, he said.
Furthermore, the Group witnessed a 139 percent YoY top line growth to record consolidated revenue of Rs. 489 million for the year under review.
This was mainly due the revenue of Rs 196 million from Padiyapelella Hydropower Limited, he said. The Groups electricity generation for the period under review was 30 million Units (KWh) versus 14 million Units (KWh) generated in the previous year. The revenue expansion also resulted due to the completion of three rooftop solar power plants which has a combined capacity of 1.2 MW.
The plants are located in Kolonna, Boralesgamuwa and Kohowala with capacities of 300KW, 400KW and 500 KW respectively.
During the period, the company has also acquired Eco Green Solar Solutions (Pvt) Ltd, which has a 1 MW Solar Power permit in Beliaththa.
On the growth front, the progress of the pre-development work in the 5.4 MW hydro projects and 5 MW Solar Projects respectively are currently on track, he said. The report also stated that Panasian Power PLC is adding new projects and plans to achieve a Rs. 300 million bottom-line by 2020 with additional solar projects and the company is confident of achieving 30 MW capacity by 2022 or earlier.
The company is aligned with the governments goal to generate 30% of electricity from
renewable energy in Sri Lanka by 2020, with an aim to increase that level up to 50% by 2030. Over the course of the coming year, the company will work to further consolidate operations across its plants while exploring new opportunities for growth and expansion.

Paying your banker back in his own coin
Personally I dont care much for banks or bankers. In fact, I really dont give a darn for those Old Scrooges sitting on piles of banknotes and wealth. They become so impersonal after you deposit your hard-earned dough with them. They keep annoying me all the time even though I am not overdue on my credit cards or any repayments. Just the other day one bank called me and told me that I had to pre-approve a credit card upgrade. And what the heck, I didnt even apply for an upgrade. Okay so they want me to increase my credit limit and make me spend more.
Whatever happened to the savings habit banks used to promote Isnt penny-pinching frugality part of the banking ethic But if you actually delve into your relationship with your banker you will realise that its really darn difficult to talk to your modern-day Shylock. Personal banking my foot! You cant even get close to their ear on the buzzer. And when you eventually do, the conversation would be like the Mad Hatter trying to talk to the March Hare.
Okay, Okay I will explain it in simpler terms. You want to talk to your banker. Or the guy or gal assigned to you as your personal banking officer. You are immediately connected to an aloof automated telephone voice system. Then you wait and listen to a cold unemotional voice saying: All our operators are busy at this moment ... please wait.
Now I am holding the blasted phone to my ear and waiting interminably 15-20 minutes. That is a heck of a long time. Indeed, a time I could have spent bashing out an article of this nature and completing it as well. And then I have to listen to the most annoying call-waiting music ever. Its the same guy singing rap and repeating the lyrics: I wanna yai yai yah. I wanna yai, yai ya! Now if I could get my hands on the guys throat I would without compunction strangle the daylights out of him and his Yai yai yah! The musical interlude is broken intermittently while the distant ghostly recorded voice starts again: All our operators are busy at this moment ... please wait.
Finally I have to verify myself and my existence by answering 20 highly secured questions. What was the maiden name of my grandmother Exasperated by this time I tell them that if my grandmother had remained a maiden she certainly would not have been my grandmother. Besides what the heck has my ancestry and my dear departed Aachchie have to do with my standing as a customer. Then I have to key in my telephone pin number and disclose my date of birth.
So now I have had it up to my neck as well. So while waiting I thought Id draft a quick letter to the banks top honcho himself. So here goes: Dear Mr. Money-Bags Holder. I noticed that whereas I personally answer your telephone calls and letters, that when I try to contact you, I am confronted by the impersonal, over-charging, pre-recorded, faceless entity which your bank has become.
From now on, I, like you, will choose only to deal with a flesh-and-blood person, not a soulless, faceless, cold voice. My credit card repayments will therefore and hereafter no longer be automatic, but will arrive at your bank, by cheque, addressed personally and confidentially to an employee at your bank whom you must nominate.
Be aware that it is an offence under the Postal Act for any other person to open such an envelope. Please find attached an Application Contract which I require your chosen employee to complete. I am sorry it runs into 12 pages, but in order that I know as much about him or her as your bank knows about me. You see you have left me with no alternative.
Please note that all copies of his or her medical history must be countersigned by a Notary Public, and the mandatory details of his/her financial situation (income, debts, assets and liabilities) must be accompanied by documented proof.
In due course, at my convenience, I will issue your employee with a PIN number which he/she must quote in dealings with me. I regret that it cannot be shorter than 28 digits but, again, I have modelled it on the number of button presses required of me to access my account balance on your phone bank service. As they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Now, allow me to level the playing field even further. When you call me, press buttons as follows:
#1. To make an appointment to see me: #2. To query a missing payment: # 3. To transfer the call to my living room in case I am there. # 4. To transfer the call to my bedroom in case I am sleeping.
# 5. To transfer the call to my washroom in case I am showering. # 6. To transfer the call to my mobile phone if I am not at home.
#7. To leave a message on my computer, a password to access my computer is required. Password will be communicated to you at a later date to that Authorized Contact mentioned earlier. # 8. To return to the main menu and to listen to options 1 through 7. # 9. To make a general complaint or inquiry. The contact will then be put on hold, pending the attention of my automated answering service.
While this may, on occasion, involve a lengthy wait, uplifting music such as that of the smooth and suave Dean Martin kind will play for the duration of the call.
I also observe your bank has a new image. Now you have a friend ... your friendly banker. Friendship, old Chappie, is based on trust. If your bank is so friendly and trusting, how come you chain down the pens to the counters Well it is clear you dont trust me, although your legend proclaims that you are a friend. Indeed, in that case I will certainly be quite willing to reciprocate that same type of friendship and trustworthiness as displayed by you.
And there was another of your ads which proclaimed: Dont borrow from your friends - borrow from us. Youll lose your friends. Youll never lose us. It seems quite unfortunate that the person who writes your banks advertising doesnt also approve the loans.
I am seriously thinking of withdrawing all my moolah and going back to traditional home banking. Surely, the safest way to double your money is to fold it over once and put it in your own pocket. Yes siree money cant buy friends, but the way you are going about it you can surely get a better class of enemy.
By the way I was also wondering if bankers can actually count. How come most of your branches always have ten counters and two tellers And talking about tellers I prefer automated tellers to your real ones. They usually have more personality. Regrettably, but again following your example, I must also levy an establishment fee to cover the setting up of this new arrangement. May I wish you a happy, if ever so slightly less prosperous weekend.

Premier advocates tradable economy
Sri Lankas economy should be transformed from a non-tradable one to a more tradable sector and the governments current economic restructuring plan is aimed at achieving this goal, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Sunday at the ceremony to award the Most Admired Companies of Sri Lanka in Colombo. The awards ceremony was organised by the International Chamber of Commerce, Sri Lanka (ICCSL) in partnership with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) Sri Lanka.
The Prime Minister said infrastructure development projects, made on foreign borrowings in the past 10 years were not properly focused and they were mainly on ports and airports, but not towards promoting the tradable sector of the economy. Sri Lanka cannot depend on export revenue earned only from tea and apparel exports.
Sri Lanka is now facing a huge debt trap and the way out of this is to look at more merchandise exports which have significantly decreased from by 33% in 2000 to 13.5% in 2017 and also promoting investments. To meet this objective Wickremesinghe said that they will work with the private sector and are also in talks to review some of the tax on the corporate sector and bring in amendments.
He said that the Sri Lankan economy is not in the best of times. The Premier said that while facing severe economic conditions due to droughts in Sri Lanka and negative impact of the global economy, Sri Lankas trade openness has also reduced from 77.4% to 37.14%. In addition trade and current account deficits too are widening while debt servicing remains a daunting task. All these have reflected in a dip in Sri Lankas economic growth which is between 4% and 4.5%.
Commenting on global economic conditions, he said that many countries are joining the fourth industrial revolution and Sri Lanka too should fall in line. To page iv

Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas made their engagement official on August 18, 2018 after their roka ceremony took place. The couple has been dating for over three months and got engaged after he proposed on her birthday in London last month. Priyanka and Nick made an appearance on the red carpet of the Met Gala last year. The couple is currently holidaying at his vacation home in California. They took a trip to Mexico last week for a day.
After their roka ceremony, there have been multiple reports in the media of the couple tying the knot in October this year in Los Angeles. Priyanka Chopras mother dismissed these reports in an interview to DNA and said that the couple is currently busy with work commitments and have not set a date yet. However, according to a report in Filmfare, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas will tie the knot in the United States of America next year.
A source informed Filmfare, Priyanka and Nick have plans of getting married in the States. The engagement ceremony happened in India so the big day will surely be happening in the U.S. Even though they plan to wed next year but they have already started planning things. Post tying the knot in the U.S., they plan to host a grand reception in Mumbai for the actresss Bollywood and Industrialists friends.

Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana invited Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran to join his party, yesterday.
He was addressing the media at the N.M. Perera Memorial Centre in Borella. Vitharana said that if the Tamil National Party (TNA) did not want a politician of Vigneswarans calibre, the LSSP would welcome him to its fold as he admired left-wing politics.
He said the LSSP would also invite Northern Provincial Council Opposition Leader S. Thavarasa to join the party as he too, was looking for a new political path based on left-wing politics.
Vitharana said the LSSP had an office in Jaffna, adding that the two politicians from North could help streamline its activities and gather support for the LSSP in the North, if they were would take the offer.
Vitharana said politicians such as Vigneswaran should be given their due place in the political sphere, as they could serve the country in a pragmatic manner.

Pulling the wool - S.B. style
Messrs S.B. Dissanayake and Dilan Perera, two defeated SLFP candidates at the last General Election who entered Parliament thanks to the munificence of President Maithripala Sirisena, via the National List, and therefore qualified to be called pin manthri (Dilan P. had the audacity to call Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who obtained over 500,000 preference votes pin agamethi), have made a serious allegation against Ministers Mangala Samaraweera and Duminda Dissanayake.
Addressing a media conference in Colombo the duo claimed that both ministers had urged President Sirisena to get the police to disrupt Wednesday's janabalaya demonstration by attacking the protestors, but the President, in contrast, had given orders to the IGP to restrain his men from any such action.
Why it took the two MPs over five days to come out with such an allegation is confounding indeed. Besides, one would have expected the more vociferous among the JO stalwarts such as Wimal Weerawansa or Udaya Gammanpila to have been the ones to make this revelation with the attendant theatrics. Is it that the duo have thought of upstaging the more loquacious among the JO spokesmen, while at the same time shamelessly continuing to remain as National List MPs in which capacity they once held ministerial office in the Government of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The fact remains that the 16 renegades of the SLFP have been placed in an embarrassing position following the unmitigated disaster that was the much heralded janabalaya kolambata circus, both, in terms of the crowd participation and the duplicitous conduct of the leaders of the protest headed by Namal Rajapaksa who was shown on television relaxing in the super luxury comfort of a Five Star hotel while the yakkos (Hoi Polloi) were roasting in the sweltering heat. Or was the attempt of the duo a diversionary tactic to detract from the wild scenes of inebriation, clownish acts of the participants and the thovil dances which were at odds with the raison d etre of the protest - the high cost of living, sale of national assets, division of the country and witch-hunts against the war heroes etc.
S.B. Dissanayake also claimed that the single slogan in unison chanted by the protestors was for installing a Government under Mahinda Rajapaksa's Premiership. Dissanayake, who still claims to be in the Sirisena camp, perhaps has lost sight of the fact that it was his leader, President Sirisena, who effectively put the brakes on Rajapaksa becoming Prime Minister by informing the voters in no uncertain terms, that he would not make the former President the PM even in the event of a UPFA/SLFP victory.
At the same media briefing Dissanayake also gave reasons for the 16 SLFP ministers and MPs quitting the Government and listed the wrongs committed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe which hastened their departure. In his view among the sins committed by the Premier was allegedly facilitating the Central Bank bond issue through the appointment of Arjuna Mahendran as CB Governor, over the protest of President Sirisena. There was also the high cost of living, the breakdown of law and order, corruption, mismanagement, thefts and the Premier breaking with tradition and vesting the Central Bank under his own Ministry of Policy Planning and Economic Affairs.
To begin with, news of the alleged bond issue first broke out in February 2015 and thereafter in April of the same year, a full four months prior to the General Election, held in August. During that time JO stalwarts such as Bandula Gunawardena and Udaya Gammanpila went to town with the revelation, their chief target being Premier Wickremesinghe. Both S. B. Dissanayake and Dilan Perera, certainly, could not have been unaware of the whole affair and the accusations levelled against the Prime Minister on the matter.
Yet, both Dissanayake and Perera had no qualms about consenting to being admitted to parliament, from the backdoor, after losing at the hustings, and joining the Unity Government in which the Prime Minister was none other than Ranil Wickremesinghe, who according to the JO was the at the centre of the whole bond issue. Neither did their stomachs turn when they sat alongside Premier Wickremesinghe at Cabinet meetings and hobnobbed with him at Government functions.
The Prime Minister suddenly became the bad guy only after the February 10 LG election where the pohottuwa recorded a sweeping victory relegating the SLFP to third place after the UNP. Suddenly, wisdom dawned on the likes of Dissanayake and Perera that they could not remain in the Government with Ranil as Prime Minister when it was all too clear to even a political novice that the Premier was only being used as a scapegoat by the SLFP dissidents to secure their political future, by opting to join the Rajapaksa camp.
All the real or imagined harm , attributed to Ranil Wickremesinghe did not come by suddenly after Feb.10 but were very much part of the scene when Dissanayaka and Perera were ministers in the Yahapalanaya Government for a full two and a half years before that.

Puttalam PS Chairman arrested for defying travel ban
Puttalam Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Anjana Sandaruwan was arrested by the Immigration Officers at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) yesterday while attempting to travel overseas despite a travel ban being imposed on him by court.
Speaking to the Daily News the Police Media Spokesmans office said that the Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman had been handed over to the CID and was questioned by them and later released. However, as the travel ban was imposed by Court, he was not allowed to travel abroad and had been asked to obtain court permission prior to leaving the country.
The travel ban had been imposed against the PS Chairman by the Puttalam High Court over a case pertaining to the murder of a person in 2010.
The incident had occurred on January 16, 2010 where a person had been shot dead in the Madurankulama area in Puttalam.

Rajapaksas Delhi visit hints at thaw
In an indication of warming of ties, former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa will visit New Delhi this week and hold important discussions.
Rajapaksa, who is credited with ending the reign of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam with the military operations from 2006 to 2009, will deliver a public lecture on India-Sri Lanka relation: the way ahead organised by the Virat Hindustan Sangam, led by BJP MP Subramanian Swamy. He is likely to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi. The External Affairs Ministry has not spoken about the meetings so far. A source said the visit was being planned by private parties.
Rajapaksa attended the swearing-in of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May 2014. He lost his Presidents post to Maithripala Sirisena in 2015. While he accused India of contributing to the regime change, he met Mr. Modi when the Prime Minister visited Sri Lanka in May 2017. The late-night meeting, apparently unscheduled, was organised at Rajapaksas request. After the war, New Delhi was disturbed by Mr. Rajapaksas apparent tilt towards China, which brought in massive investments to Sri Lanka. He was also criticised for the alleged human rights violations committed by the Sri Lankan military during the war.
The visit comes less than a week after thousands of demonstrators, led by Rajapaksa, protested in Colombo against the governments economic policies and the delay in holding provincial elections.
The Rajapaksa camp is yet to name its candidate for the presidential election likely at the end of 2019. A 2015 constitutional amendment has placed a two-term limit on the presidency, thus barring the former President from contesting again, but Rajapaksas supporters have sought the Supreme Courts clarification. There is an opinion that I can contest again. We need to find out if I am eligible, he told presspersons recently.
Political sources in Colombo point to the efforts to groom his son and Hambantota MP, Namal Rajapaksa, who is accompanying his father on the India trip. He played a role in mobilising supporters for last weeks rally.
Though out of power for more than three years, Mr. Rajapaksa, who represents Kurunegala district in Parliament, remains a formidable political actor in Sri Lankan politics, often challenging the fractured coalition in power. - THE HINDU

Record four-leaf clover hunter
A 10-year-old Virginia girl didnt even have to leave her back yard to set the Guinness World Record for finding four-leaf clovers.
Robert and Sara Borka said their daughter, Katie, has a unique talent for finding four-leaf clovers, so they encouraged her to try for the Guinness World Record.
The record-keeping organization said it did not have a previous entry for the record, so officials determined the girl would have to find 25 of the clovers to set a new record -- something she accomplished in the first seven minutes of searching in her familys Spotsylvania County back yard.
The girl said she had to throw out several clovers found to have five, six, seven, eight and nine leaves, leaving her with a total 166 clovers by the end of the hour.
Shes never done it for more than five or 10 minutes at a time, so we didnt know what she would get, Sara Borka told The Free Lance-Star newspaper. But she really does find them everywhere.
The parents said they have submitted the required evidence to Guinness to get Katies official certification as a record-holder. The record attempt has made Katie a popular local figure, with even the Spotsylvania County Government offering its congratulations in a Facebook post.

Rs. 5,900 mn allocated for human-elephant conflict
We have got funds of nearly Rs. 5,900 million to prevent the human-elephant conflict, Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said recently.
There is a shortage of manpower to maintain electric fences to keep away elephants. Moreover, the Wildlife staff detailed for this task lack basic facilities including lodging and sanitation facilities. We are gradually making changes for the better, the Minister told the Daily News.
The Minister said that Wildlife guards have not been in uniform for years and steps are being taken to provide them with uniforms and boots. Also, instead of the present 12 bore gun they are to be armed with SAR40 firearms. Although protective fences have been constructed round the reservations, around 70 percent of the wild elephants live outside them, which raises the possibility of human-elephant conflicts, he said.

Salaries, fuel costs eat into Railway bottomline
The Railway Departments recurrent expenditure has been more than double of its total revenue last year, the Performance Report of Sri Lanka Railway (SLR) indicated.
The report stated that the Railway Departments recurrent expenditure increased by 5.1 percent to Rs. 14,080.66 million last year due to increase in employees emoluments, while its total revenue was Rs. 6,477.11 million. The report was tabled in Parliament last week.
The gap between the recurrent expenditure and the revenue continued due to the increase in salaries and expenditure for fuel, the Department said in its report, identifying it as one of the main challenges the Department faced.
Compared to 2016, the Departments revenue had only grown by 0.1 percent last year. The increasing number of season ticketholders was the main factor for the drop in passenger revenue in 2017 because SLR loses 60 percent revenue from a season ticket. It charges only 40 percent from the face value of the ordinary ticket. The number of normal passengers was decreased by three percent from 68.97 million in 2016 to 67.03 million and no fair revision has taken place since 2008. This has been a major reason for the reduction of revenue in 2017, the report explained.
It further said that the overtime expenditure has increased annually due to the existing vacancies in SLR.
According to the reports statistics, a total of 9,382 trains were cancelled last year. Out of them 7,663 were passenger trains. A total of 9,217 trains which operated last year faced delays of more than one hour. Out of them 4,690 were passenger trains. A total of 11,175 trains which operated last year were delayed between 30 minutes to 60 minutes. Out of them 10,727 were passenger trains.
The report stated that 59 percent of the trains operated punctually last year.
According to the report, 180 people committed suicide on rail tracks last year. Four people died while another 70 were injured after falling off trains. Twelve people died and 59 people were injured due to train accidents involving vehicles on railway level crossings, last year.
The Railway Security Service apprehended 1,333 passengers for ticketless travel and collected Rs. 4.1 million in fines last year. SLR apprehended 292 for travel in classes irrelevant to their tickets and collected Rs 912,992 million in fines.

Serena fined $17,000 after US Open final outburst
NEW YORK, Sunday - Serena Williams has been fined $17,000 by the US Tennis Association in the wake her outburst during a controversial US Open final loss to Japan's Naomi Osaka.
The American star was fined for coaching, racquet abuse and for verbal abuse when she accused umpire Carlos Ramos of being "a thief" during Saturday's stormy final.
Williams was incensed at the coaching violation, although coach Patrick Mouratoglou, sitting in her box, admitted that he was coaching when he moved his hands.
That violation carried a $4,000 fine, while a second violation for racquet abuse -- after she smashed her racquet after dropping her serve in the fifth game of the second set -- cost her $3,000.
The second violation also cost her a point in the match, sparking her renewed verbal attack on Ramos, a code violation which carried a $10,000 fine.
Her third code violation of the match also cost her a game, putting Osaka on the brink of what would be a 6-2, 6-4 victory that made her the first Japanese player to win a Grand Slam title. - AFP

SIDATH WETTIMUNY
Cool, calm and collected is what Sidath Wettimuny was, one of the greatest opening batsmen produced by Sri Lanka and in my book he was simply the best better than all the rest. As an opening batsman his technical brilliance has not been matched thus far. This was mainly due to his late fathers efforts in the backyard of their house down Park Road Colombo 5 which had a turf strip reports suggested. He played for Ananda College and the SSC with distinction.
It is no wonder that Sidath was at his very best when he played that monumental knock of 190 at Lords against England.
Sidath at present is in the advisory committee to look into to the shortcomings of our school cricket. The committee has had two seminars and Sidath has spoken to the school principals, the masters in charge in one seminar and the coaches and the captains in the next. He felt that the capabilities of the coaches were sadly lacking which has become a big problem. He was of the opinion that these coaches were employed by the schools in an ad hoc manner. On the other hand these coaches never had facilities to train and develop. He was of the view that a dearth of quality coaches came about when we won the ICC Cricket World Cup in 1996 and there was a cricket boom in the country amongst the youngsters taking up to the game, and to cope up with this the schools good coaches were hard to find. Sidath stated that all the good work done by Ana Punchihewa went down the drain because he lost the election immediately after the World Cup triumph. This was the time where the rot set in, pointed out Sidath. Today the coaches only objective is to win at any cost and if not they were sacked.
This commitee wanted to change the present culture. The budding cricketers should be taught the importance of the spirit of the game. They did a lot of work on batting, bridged the gap by educating the coaches.
During the last program batting was highlighted and the mistakes in coaching and in the players, repeatedly observed in kids gave them some food for thought, the committee had to resort to giving solutions via CDs because to reach out to the vast numbers individually was a far cry.
They also had 3 seminars on educating principles on how to promote cricket - this was relayed to the masters in charge and the coaches as well.
At present there are numerous clubs with voting rights only by name, Sidath was bold enough to name two and they were Bohras SC and Liberty CC. Sidath stated that Thilanga Sumathipala was instrumental in this scenario.
Sports as a whole has deteriorated to such an extent that we did not win a single medal in the recently concluded Asian Games. Should the Sports Law and the cricket constitution be changed
The Sports Law is relevant to all sports and then there is the individual cricket constitution which can be changed through an Act of Parliament. He was pessimistic that they will do that and pruning the 22 clubs to 12 clubs in the Premier tournament.
Sidath stated that somebody should bite the bullet and say thats it! Top 12 or 10 clubs should play in the Premier. He also emphasized that the old system they had like Sara Trophy, Donovan Andree and Daily News trophies had no issues and they were uncomplicated. The Sports Minister should take the bull by the horns. There is no sustainability in tournaments as they come and go.
Arjuna Ranatunga changed our mind set, he was cocky and arrogant which was good and he showed that we can win.
Anjglo Mathews is not aggressive enough but Dinesh Chandimal is aggressive stated Sidath. We are never short of talent. Talent is there but youngsters are not ready and should be given time. We have two good spinners in Akila Dananjaya and Sandakan and a good crop of pace bowlers.
Sidath is worried about the attitude of players like Niroshan Dickwella who goes to the wicket to score fours off each and every ball. He says that does not work. He also thinks that they should have strategies to every changing situation of the game. Sidath is confident that Chandika Hathurusingha will do a good job with our boys.
Coming back to our batting Sidath is really disappointed that our guys are trying to blast their way through the first ten overs like Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana did in the past.
Those tactics are outdated now and Sidath said that we need a batsman to last till the end and Chandimal is the only batsman who thinks in that direction.
We are decently placed to take our game up noted Sidath. Kusal Mendis is enormously talented although he has his weakness outside his off stump. Sidath said that Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva have a very bright future.
Sidath says that they wont be getting pancake type wickets which are dead easy to bat however they should also have solid techniques to score runs without gifting their wickets away on seaming tracks.
Sidath is of the view that more and more countries should strive to play Test cricket which is good for the game.
He has been involved with the ICC wearing different hats twice. He has been a director and also a Match Referee. When inquired about the future of our cricket he said: your guess is as good as mine.

SriLankan Catering posts Rs. 3.9 bn net profit
SriLankan Catering Ltd. has recorded a steady financial performance for the financial year ended March 31, 2018 with a 26% year-on-year growth in operating profits from Rs 3.03 billion to Rs. 3.81 billion.
Its unaudited financial statements also showed that the operating profit ratio which stood at 42% in the last year improved to 44% during the year 2017/18. It has also reported a post-tax net profit of Rs. 3.9 billion during the year, which is a 4% increase compared to the previous year.
A somewhat low growth in net profit has been reported as a result of a drop in exchange gains which dropped from Rs 833 million in the previous financial year to Rs 202 million this year.
Ranjit Fernando, Chairman of SriLankan Catering who is also the Chairman of SriLankan Airlines, said, SriLankan Catering continues to be a tower of strength to our nation and the SriLankan Airlines Group. Last year, they have achieved yet another stellar performance. The company has proven itself to be a perfect example of consistency and has crossed the Rs. 2 billion mark in profits every year, during the last five years.
This performance for the financial year 2017/18 was a 26% increase over the operating profit of the previous year, a tremendous achievement by the catering arm of Sri Lankas National Carrier.
Lalith Withana, Chief Executive Officer of SriLankan Catering, said: The impressive performance of the company is evidence of the strong negotiation skills and financial discipline of the entire team who have worked hard to overcome the multiple challenges faced during the past year.

A supposedly fun movie Ill never see again
Just like Sonny and Cher, gyrating amusement park rides, and eating an entire plate of cheese kottu in one sitting-Destination Wedding seems like a really good idea at first, but is quickly revealed to be a complete disaster.
Destination Wedding is an indie film, shot in less than 10 days with a $1 million budget. That way, its extraordinary and praiseworthy to have big-name stars like Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder teaming up for their fourth time on screen to take part in the writer and director Victor Levins eccentric and ambitious project. Unfortunately, however, Destination Wedding, felt like a chore to watch.
Ryder and Reeves play nihilistic misanthropes, Lindsay and Frank, who meet at a wedding they probably shouldnt have attended, seeing as they both hate the groom. Lindsay is the ex-fiance of the groom, who sued him after their break-up, and Frank is the grooms grumpy, estranged brother. Levin seemed to challenge the typical romantic comedy structure, and accepted notions of romance in general, which, on the surface, sounds like a pretty good idea. Levins artistic vision might have channeled the Hollywood romantic comedies of the 1950s or 60s, written more as a play than a movie. But the characters lacked an essential charm, and displayed inadequate wit to make their deadening outlooks engaging.
The movie starts in an airport, where Lindsay and Franks first interaction immediately devolves into bickering: she thinks he has stepped in line in front of her, and he thinks she is annoying. They are seated next to each other on the plane, and learn that they are to attend the same destination wedding in Paso Robles, California.
The two are continually thrown together, taking the same shuttle to their hotel, given adjacent hotel rooms, and seated side-by-side at the rehearsal dinner. At one point they muse whether they are being set up by the bride and groom (though it may be more likely that the bride and groom didnt know what else to do with their most unlikable guests).
Lindsay and Frank argue about everything-from the nature of a Destination Wedding, to the exorbitant cost of food in the hotel mini-bar, to which one of them is a worse person and who hates themselves more, to who hates the bride and groom more, and what constitutes political and cultural insensitivity. Simultaneously, their chatter usually ignores how they are insensitive to everything and everyone around them, making little concessions to their own narcissism. At one point, Frank says, Were all tired, trite, trivial, tiresome, tone-deaf narcissists. His argument fails to recognise the degrees of that narcissism, which he particularly seems to suffer from.
What makes this ranting exhausting is not only the subject of those rants, but the fact that Frank and Lindsay are the only characters who speak the entire film (literally, just those two). Their dialogue was interspersed-thankfully-by banda-style music playing to the scenery of Southern Californias bucolic wine country. Because Levin wrote a script where every word matters, it seems foolish that the dialogue was as loquacious and fast-paced as it was. When the dialogue did slow down, highlighting an important line here or there, it served to further isolate the characters from everyone else around them, including the audience: Ive missed every possible sexual revolution, including Tindr, says Frank. Why do we live Frank replies Lindsay.
Eventually, the two become drunk and self-pitying enough that they begin to fall for each other. This leads to an almost unbearable sex-scene that was like watching a train wreck in slow motion: you cant take your eyes away. After running from a mountain lion or a cougar (or a lynx, or a panther, because they have no idea and have apparently never seen a wild animal before) and tumbling down a dry, grassy hill, Lindsay and Frank kiss. The first time, they agree is a mistake. They kiss again, another mistake, and the third time they start doing other things as well, talking non-stop about what a bad idea it is, and how long its been, and how they dont have a condom, and even though Lindsay is worried about getting pregnant, she says it really couldnt make her life any worse than it already is. The scene is truly baffling, so painful, you actually may laugh.
Towards the end of the film, Lindsay reveals herself as an increasingly optimistic character, intent (for no apparent reason, other than that they are both unlikable) on falling in love with Frank. Frank reveals himself as a questioning fundamentalist, a misanthrope who is surprised to hate Lindsay a little less than everyone else. While in bed together at the hotel, he remarks upon the symmetry of her face and the circumference of her ankles, and Lindsay says that he is really good looking too. When they leave Paso Robles, their last spar has Lindsay arguing that they keep in touch and extend the affair a little longer, and Frank asks what the point of that would be.
Recently, Levin did an interview with the U.S. newspaper, The Washington Post, where he was asked if he himself had an aversion to destination weddings. He replied, Im happy to go and honored to be invited, but theres a certain self-importance to it, is there not Well, thats how the movie Destination Wedding played out as well. Everyone is happy to go and watch Ryder and Reeves, but Levins characters and script, no matter who acted them, were just too self-important to appreciate.

Toomuas Wallaby return good for competition, says Beale
Brisbane, Monday: Matt Toomua's return to the Wallabies fold has injected some much-needed competition, Kurtley Beale said Monday, after the Leicester inside centre's standout performance against South Africa.
Coach Michael Cheika took a gamble for Saturday's clash in Brisbane by axing playmaker Bernard Foley from the starting line-up for the first time in four years, introducing Toomua to the side and shifting Beale to fly-half.
It paid off with Australia snapping a four-game losing streak to win 23-18.
The composed Toomua, eligible for the Wallabies again after signing a deal with the Melbourne Rebels for next season, following two years with Leicester in England, slotted in seamlessly.
He finished with a 15-point haul, including a try, two conversions and two penalties to be named man-of-the-match.
"He's obviously a quality player and having him there has created a lot of healthy competition among the playmakers," said the versatile Beale, who took over the number 10 shirt from Foley to direct operations alongside Toomua.
"We haven't had that for a while -- probably not since Matt Giteau left (in 2016) -- but once you have that competition there you get the better out of each other.
"It's certainly good for the group."
Despite being axed, Foley took it his stride and helped Beale and Toomua prepare as best he could, leaving Cheika with plenty of options ahead of the World Cup next year.
"Nothing really changed for him. That's the quality of player and person that he is," Beale said of Foley.
"He does a lot of work behind the scenes helping myself and Matty going into last week's game and having him there to help here and there certainly helped.
"He has taken it really well and he's a tough, resilient guy. He will bounce back in no time."
With the wind in their sails, the Wallabies turn their attention to Argentina on the Gold Coast this weekend after the Pumas were outclassed by the All Blacks 46-24 in Nelson -- their 26th defeat in 27 to New Zealand. AFP

Police yesterday arrested two persons including a Vanathavilluwa Pradeshiya Sabha member of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (Phottuwa) for allegedly causing damage to public properties at a waste disposal yard being constructed at Aruwakkalu in Vanathavilluwa.
These two persons were involved in storming into this waste disposal yard and allegedly damaging the property during a protest held on Sunday.
People living in Karathiu and Therakkuliya staged a protest against this waste disposal site under construction and argue that this landfill project would cause groundwater contamination.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka made an observation tour to the proposed garbage disposal site yesterday and reiterated that this site would not have any impact on the environment and the ground water.
The Minister added that waste will be brought to the site after compressing the garbage so that water in the garbage will be reduced by 80 per cent. The Aruwakkalu landfill project launched on Februaryn 1,2018 is to be completed in November next year.

UN HR chief expresses concern
Newly appointed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet raised concerns over recurrent incidents of racist and inter-communal violence and plans to resume the death penalty in Sri Lanka.
Bachelet, who assumed duties as the UN Human Rights Chief on September 1, referred to Sri Lanka in her Opening Statement at the 39th session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva.
Recurrent incidents of racist and inter-communal violence are disturbing, as are announced plans to resume use of the death penalty, she noted. With reference to the issue of missing persons, she was optimistic that the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) would provide answers to the issues of the families of the disappeared.
In Sri Lanka, although the authorities have moved too slowly towards meaningful implementation of the transitional justice agenda, the OMP has now begun consultations and institutional capacity-building to fulfill its mandate. We look to that Office to work quickly, to begin to provide answers to the families of the disappeared. Legislation establishing an Office for Reparations is also underway. More progress in advancing accountability and truth-seeking could have great weight in the long-term stability and prosperity of the nation, she said.
In the wake of the US decision to pull out of the UNHRC, Bachelet said, I am convinced that this Council must strive for consensus. I believe there should be more engagement by all Member States  not sterile disputes, not withdrawals, but collective, coordinated and cooperative work to sustain core principles and common goals.

US Open champion Djokovic: I owe Federer, Nadal
NEW YORK, Monday: Novak Djokovic was thrilled to match Pete Sampras with a 14th Grand Slam title at the US Open on Sunday, but he said its Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal who have made him the player he is.
Pete Sampras is one of the biggest legends ever to play the game, Djokovic said after earning a third US Open crown with a 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 victory over Juan Martin del Potro.
He was my childhood idol. He was someone I was looking up to. The first actual thing I saw related to tennis on the TV was his first or second Wimbledon championship. That inspired me to start playing tennis.
There is a lot of significance of me being now shoulder to shoulder in terms of Grand Slam wins with him.
The victory puts Djokovic three Slam wins away from Nadals 17 and six behind Federers record 20.
It will also see him rise to number three in the world behind Nadal and Federer -- the rankings again reflecting the Big Three status they have shared for so long.
Djokovic had tumbled down the rankings, slowed last year by an elbow injury and a loss of confidence that accompanied a 54-week title drought.
Since bursting out of the slump with an unexpected Wimbledon title he has gone from strength to strength, adding a long-awaited Cincinnati Masters title to his resume before adding the US Open title to those he won in 2011 and 2015.
Djokovic faced neither of his greatest rivals en route to the title in Flushing Meadows. Seeded to face Federer in the quarter-finals, he found himself instead across the net from John Millman after the unheralded Australian stunned the Swiss great.  AFP

A special Inland Revenue Department Counter will be opened at the Katunayake Bandaranaike International Airport Departure Lounge by Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera today (11).
This counter will reimburse foreign tourists with the 15% VAT charged for VAT entitled goods they have purchased within the country at the time of their departure, said the Finance and Mass Media Ministry in a statement issued yesterday.
This scheme proposed in the 2018 budget is implemented by the Department of Inland Revenue.
Owners of business institutions should register the names of their institutions with the Inland Revenue Department to enter this VAT reimbursement scheme. Already, 18 trade establishments dealing in goods and garments had registered themselves with the department to enter this scheme.
This VAT reimbursement proposal made in the 2018 Budget was a step towards establishing Sri Lanka as a Trading hub in Asia and attracting more foreign tourists to the country. This tax reimbursement scheme was already implemented by many countries to attract foreign tourists. Sri Lanka too would gain world attention once this scheme was started here too. Attraction of more tourists would help boost the countrys economy too.

According to Variety, Warner Bros. is currently developing the animated movie Coyote Vs. Acme written by the sibling writing duo Jon and Josh Silberman and produced by Lego Batman director Chris McKay.
The story will allegedly be set in the Acme Warehouse, where anything and everything used by the Looney Tunes characters has been made. Glenn Ficarra and John Requa have both been rumoured to direct, but no official move has been made yet.
If McKay brings along his casting director from Lego Batman, Mary Hidalgo will be in charge of this, but until we have an official director, its a little too early to make guesses.

World sailing rows back on Tokyo 2020 criticism
Fujisawa, Monday: After issuing sharp criticism of preparations for the Tokyo Olympics, the world sailing federation said Monday that organisers had made much progress as it held a test event at the 2020 venue.
In April, World Sailing said Tokyo 2020 was well behind schedule in terms of its preparations, with concerns over fishing fleets operating on the course, and over security.
This led IOC coordination commission chairman John Coates to warn 2020 organisers they had to be prepared to answer these questions when they are raised, or confidence could waver.
But speaking at a World Cup series event at the Olympic venue of Enoshima island near Tokyo, a World Sailing official said that they had really seen a big change.
We had some concerns at the beginning of the year but we have seen a huge amount of activities over the last few months leading up to this first test event and World Cup, Alastair Fox, director of events for World Sailing, told reporters.
Fox said World Sailing was treating the Enoshima regatta as an Olympic test event, adding: We have a lot to learn with less than two years until the Tokyo 2020 opening ceremony. AFP
