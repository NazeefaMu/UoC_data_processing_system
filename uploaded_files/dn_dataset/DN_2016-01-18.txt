How 'The Revenant' - and Big Data - Will Change Movies Forever
The critics have spoken: The Revenant is gripping, gorgeous, and at times grotesque. Now we have the data to prove it.
Before the Leonardo DiCaprio epic hit wide release, Fox Studios partnered with a small bioanalytics software company called Lightwave to measure how audiences were reacting to the film. It was a marriage of Hollywood and technology that could potentially change the way movies are made.
Last fall, Lightwave monitored approximately 100 moviegoers in four cities - Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington, DC. All were there to see a pre-release version of this brutal tale of survival and revenge set in 1820.
Lightwave strapped a medical-grade fitness tracker on each volunteer's wrist. It then measured their heart rate ten times each second, as well as their body temperature, movements, and how conductive their skin became as their autonomic nervous systems took over, indicating a fight-or-flight response.
(Spoiler alert: If you haven't seen the movie yet, you might want to skip this next paragraph.)
Lights, camera, reaction!
The first big surge in the audience's fight or flight happens roughly 26 minutes into the film, when Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) has a near-fatal encounter with a grizzly bear. It then happens 14 more times during the movie, as characters are shot, knifed, impaled with arrows, buried alive, hanged, chased through a series of majestic winter landscapes, and drowned in icy cold rivers.
When the audiences' hearts weren't pounding, they were transfixed - spending more than 76 minutes of the film's 156-minute runtime motionless, according to Lightwave's sensors, which communicated wirelessly in real time with the company's software.
By the time the credits were rolling, Lightwave had collected "hundreds of millions of rows of data," says Rana June, Lightwave's founder and CEO.
Of course, Hollywood has been pre-screening films to gauge audience reaction since before there were talkies. Stories of famous films that were heavily revised after a negative screening are legion. But previous methods of audience measurement were crude and inaccurate, says June. "People would sit through a two-hour movie and then asked if they liked it, or they were told to fill out a questionnaire," says June. "It's difficult for anyone to remember what happened at minute 13 of a movie. This removes the bias from the equation and gives filmmakers a robust set of data to work with."
Screen gems
Surprisingly, Lightwave started out developing technology to help club DJs measure the reactions of their dub-stepping, mosh-pit-diving audience, says June, a former club DJ herself. It's since brought this technology to concerts, sporting events, reality TV shows, and, now, major motion pictures that have Oscar written all over them.
The ultimate goal is for filmmakers and other artists to use this data as they're creating the works, says June. It offers a way to test whether that Adam Sandler comedy really is funny (it isn't) or if the Hunger Games franchise has totally jumped the shark (it has), theoretically giving studios a way to fix these films well before they hit the theaters. "A lot of people don't realize this, but the body has a lot of physiological indicators into the emotional experience people are having," says June. "Artists can use this as a new color to paint with. It's a brand new world of data that's never been available before."
Whether this results in more engaging, well-paced and thoughtfully constructed films - or simply more movies that pander to the universal lizard brain - is unknown. But it looks like we're going to find out.

Suicide bomber kills 13 in Afghan city
AFGHANISTAN: At least 13 people were killed and 14 others wounded when a suicide bomber struck the home of a prominent politician in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad on Sunday, authorities said.
The bombing marks the second deadly attack in the city since Wednesday, when Islamic State jihadists claimed responsibility for a deadly gun and bomb siege targeting the Pakistani consulate.
The latest attack came during a "jirga", an assembly of tribal leaders, at the home of politician Obaiduallah Shinwari, who escape unscathed.
"Thirteen people were killed and 14 others injured when a suicide bomber targeted the house of Shinwari," said a statement from the governor of Nangarhar province, of which Jalalabad is the capital. Shinwari is a well-known member of Nangarhar's provincial council and his family is said to be actively involved in local politics.
The uptick in violence comes amid renewed international efforts to revive peace talks with the Taliban, locked in a tussle for supremacy with the Islamic State group in Afghanistan.
Last week representatives of Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and China met in a bid to revive stalled Taliban peace talks, even as the insurgents wage a brazen winter campaign of violence. The so-called "roadmap" talks were meant to lay the groundwork for direct dialogue between the Afghan government and the Islamists to end the 14-year Taliban insurgency.
The four-country group is set to hold the next round of discussions on Monday in Kabul.

Suu Kyi bemoans youth 'wasting time' online
MYANMAR: Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi, who was forced to spend years of solitude under house arrest, has hit out at young people "wasting time" on computer games and social networking.
The veteran opposition politician, whose party will soon take power after winning landmark elections last November, made the comments in a letter to organisers of a literary festival at the weekend in Yangon.
"Our lifestyles are changing nowadays as technology improves," she wrote in a public letter to the Nobel-Myanmar Literary Festival posted online late Saturday.
"Now our children waste a lot of their time on computer games, Internet games and social networks. Children read less because the use of technology has increased," she added.
Suu Kyi is widely adored in Myanmar for her years of steely opposition to decades of brutal and corrupt junta rule.
In November her National League for Democracy (NLD) trounced the military-backed governing party and will soon form a new administration -- though the army will still wield significant power under the junta-written constitution.
The NLD's electoral success owes much to capturing the youth vote in a country where just over half the population is under 27.
But Suu Kyi, who turned 70 last year and was an academic before she became a politician, has never professed to be at the forefront of technology.
For the best part of two decades she had little more than a dusty library of books and the radio to keep her company during long periods of house arrest, before her release in 2010 and the country's slow transition towards a quasi-democracy.
Just a few years ago access to the Internet was limited and monitored while a mobile phone would cost thousands of dollars.
Now Myanmar is as awash with smartphones and social media accounts as many of its regional neighbours.
In her letter Suu Kyi also hit out at education standards, citing underfunding as well as a tendency towards rote learning rather than critical analysis.
"We rarely have libraries in our schools and we have no more time to read books when we are in class," she said.
"Our education system is about learning by heart and answering questions, limiting critical thinking and reading books."
Under junta rule education and healthcare spending was chronically neglected as the military lavished what little income the impoverished nation had on itself and its allies within the business elite.
Expectations are sky-high that Suu Kyi and the NLD will begin to reverse that trend. But the military still retains control of key security ministries, a de facto veto in parliament and huge economic clout through army-owned conglomerates.

To understand why IS just hit Jakarta, dont look to Paris - look to Indonesia
INDONESIA: When Islamic State militants used handguns and grenades to carry out a deadly attack in Jakarta on Thursday, a top Indonesian police official immediately compared it to the brutal assaults in Paris late last year that killed 130 people.
There were definite similarities. Both attacks took place in the heart of crowded capitals, both involved militants using guns and explosives, and both were claimed by ISIS. They also both claimed lives: at least eight civilians were killed in the Jakarta strike, which injured 23 others, including five police officers. Five assailants died in the onslaught  some by their own hand  and police arrested four others.
But the Jakarta attack also differed significantly from the Paris ones. Despite the ISIS connection, the Jakarta assault showed evidence of motivations and patterns particular to Indonesia, was likely carried out in response to specific conditions in Indonesia, and cannot be understood outside the context of Indonesias history of homegrown extremism  as well as the governments violent campaign against it.
This was a brazen attack in Central Jakarta during lunch hours, but the casualty figures remain astounding low, Judith Jacob, a Singapore-based terrorism and security analyst, told Foreign Policy. It didnt have the same level of indiscriminate of firing that we saw in Istanbul or Paris.
It wasnt even clear that civilians were the main targets. The attackers appear to have focussed on the area around a tiny police station in the middle of Jalan Thamrin, a thoroughfare connecting the Hotel Indonesia roundabout, where the well-known Selamat Datang (Welcome) monument overlooks dizzying snarls of traffic, to Merdeka Square, an area equivalent to the National Mall in Washington. When President Barack Obama visited Jakarta in 2010, he drove down Jalan Thamrin as part of a sentimental trip through a city he had lived in as a child.
The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack  its first in Southeast Asia. Indonesian police identified Bahrun Naim, an Indonesian citizen thought now to be in or near the Islamic States de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, as the principle organizer. Naim is a leader of Katibah Nusantara, an extremist group that has served as a link between ISIS and Islamist militants in Indonesia and Malaysia. Katibah Nusantara had around 100 members in 2014, but indications are that it had grown considerably and was being deployed in different areas, Sidney Jones, director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, told Foreign Policy last September.
Naim, the accused organizer, has called for Indonesian Islamist radicals to emulate the Paris attacks in Jakarta, Jacob said. But it still begs the question: How much has this been an Indonesian jihadist capitalizing on events that have happened recently in Paris to further the ambitions of an inward looking jihadist movement within Indonesia
Police in Indonesia have long grappled with homegrown extremism. They have also been its target. The predominate targeting choice has been security services, Jacob said, although Thursdays attack represented a slight departure from that norm because of the apparent inclusion of a Starbucks in Sarinah  the citys oldest mall, and a landmark in its own right  located alongside the police post.
At this moment we are still conducting a thorough investigation and have not come to any specific conclusion yet, Budi Bowoleksono, the Indonesian ambassador to the United States, said by email, in response to a question from Foreign Policy about whether police officers were the intended victims.
Militant group Jemaah Islamiah carried out bombings in Bali in 2002 that left morethan 200 people dead. At the time, the group had ties to al Qaeda. Santoso, a terrorist leader once part of Jemaah Islamiah, has since pledged to back ISIS. His supporters, based in the area around the town of Poso, in Sulawesi, have carried out a number of assaults on police.
The targeted attacks on police just escalated after police forces started to chase the radicals in Poso, which has been their hiding place for some time, since 2011 or 2012, Fitriyan Zamzami, the national affairs editor of Republika, a prominent Jakarta newspaper, told Foreign Policy. The police and the radicals have been in a tit-for-tat game in Poso ever since.
Zamzami said the police may have sparked the attack by launching a crackdown on domestic terror suspects shortly before Christmas. Some 16 were taken into custody in the past month. - Photo credit: Bay Ismoyo/AFP/Getty Images
