Boralu Boyz Mountain Trail Biking Skills Training Camp
Boralu Boyz a mountain biking group has organised a Mountain Trail Biking (MTB) skills training camp featuring Kerstin Kogler from Germany. Kerstin, an MTB pro rider and qualified coach is also a member of the BMC Swiss riding team and will be conducting a MTB skills training camp in Sri Lanka. Her extensive knowledge in coaching, racing and preparation for a race will be of benefit to all participants.
Kerstin Kogler
The training will be in three categories with basic, intermediate and advanced, spanning over three days.
The Boralu Boyz was formed in 2013 when a selected group of riders were invited to ride a freshly carved out trail from Beragala to Kuda Oya, through the Udawalve jungle. After successfully completing this fantastic and epic adventure, the riders and their bikes were all huddled up in a bus, on the return trip to Colombo.
During the long 5 hour bus ride from Udawalave to Colombo, this group of riders decided to come up with a name identifying them, in line with their passion, of Mountain Biking.
Many names were suggested and finally with much debate, it was decided unanimously that the name should be Boralu Boyz - fitting more so as they ride the roller coaster Boralu Trail very often.
The Primary objectives of the BB's are Health, fitness and fun. The Order of the day is to enjoy the ride with banter and laughter which is nothing short of making each ride memorable whilst of course keeping up the challenge of climbing, the long and steep uphill stretches, maintaining good balance and speed in downhill areas and off road tracks.
The BB's rides take place on weekdays and weekends starting 6 am. They also have specially organized rides out of Colombo on long weekends and special holidays.
Taking into consideration the growing number of MTB riders and the lack of skill and information available for good riding Boralu Boyz have the fine opportunity of securing a world-class rider cum coach to help Sri Lankan's attain a higher level of skill in riding mountain bikes. The event will be held on the 11th, 12th and 13th of November. The areas covered for the training of skills will include basic, intermediate and advance spanning over three days. The tickets are priced at a very nominal Rs. 5000 per day, which will include refreshments. All riders should take this opportunity and benefit from Kerstin and advance their riding skills. Furthermore the Boralu Boyz are offering a day of advance training to the very competitive riders some of them being Army, Navy and Air force personnel who can represent Sri Lanka at an international level free of charge.

Ireland aim for Cubs spirit against All Blacks
Ireland will attempt to emulate the Chicago Cubs by ending more than a century of futility on Saturday against a record-breaking New Zealand side chasing rugby immortality.
Chicago has been engulfed by rapturous celebrations this week after the Cubs erased 108 years of torment by finally winning baseball's World Series with a come-from-behind defeat of the Cleveland Indians.
Ireland, however, have an even longer-running tale of woe when it comes to meetings with New Zealand: in 28 matches since 1905, they have never beaten the All Blacks.
- Like the Cubs -
Beauden Barrett of the New Zealand All Blacks prepares for a training session at Toyota Park on November 3, 2016 in Chicago, Illinois. AFP
until this season at any rate -- there have been plenty of near-misses and gallant failures along the way.
Three years ago Ireland led 19-0 in Dublin only to lose 24-22 with the last kick of the match. Ireland's no-nonsense Kiwi coach Joe Schmidt is reluctant to see the Cubs' success as an omen.
Gee, I'd love to believe in omens but I don't, Schmidt said.
I'm not superstitious at all. 1908 That's a bit similar to 1905. But I think the similarities stop there.
- Elusive opposition -
Schmidt meanwhile is adamant that Ireland's 111-year wait for a first victory over New Zealand does not weigh heavily on his squad's psyche. It doesn't have a direct relevance for us, other than the continued frustration that it's a game, and a team, that has been pretty elusive, Schmidt said.
But in world rugby we're not the only ones. There's a number of other teams around the world who haven't managed to do it and who would love to be where we are now. That said, there will not be a happier man than Schmidt in Soldier Field on Saturday should Ireland manage to upset the New Zealanders.
I would be delighted for the players, and for the past players who can't wait to see it happen, said Schmidt. And all the supporters who've had a number of visits to All Black fixtures and never had a result. The odds however are stacked against Ireland, who have had less than a week in camp together to prepare for what will be their first Test match since a 2-1 series defeat to South Africa in June.
World champions New Zealand meanwhile head into their second visit to Soldier Field -- they trounced the United States at the venue in 2014 -- brimming with confidence after completing their Bledisloe Cup series whitewash over Australia in Auckland last month.
- Hansen wants 'full noise' -
That 37-10 win was a record 18th consecutive victory.
A clean sweep on their Northern Hemisphere tour, which also includes Tests against Italy and France, as well as a return fixture with Ireland in Dublin, would see the Kiwis finish the year with 22 straight wins, an astounding achievement in the modern era.
The longest unbeaten streak in rugby history stands at 23 -- when New Zealand compiled 22 wins and one draw between 1987 and 1990.
New Zealand coach Steve Hansen, however, is not looking past Saturday's date in Chicago against an Irish side he rates highly.
I know that this Irish side is a good team, Hansen said.
Last time we played them they should have won. They've only got better since then.
They've beaten South Africa this year and had a great series against them. So they'll be full noise on Saturday. We'll need to be full noise too. New Zealand's preparations have been complicated by injuries to their star locks Sam Whitelock and Brodie Retallick. Another second row, Luke Romano, flew back to New Zealand this week after a family bereavement.
Hansen has turned to blindside flanker Jerome Kaino to plug the gap at lock, where the Blues player will pack down alongside Patrick Tuipulotu.
Behind the pack, Aaron Smith returns to partner Beauden Barrett, the scrum-half's first start since his involvement in an airport toilet sex scandal in September.

Windies defeat a wake-up call for Pakistan
SHARJAH, Friday - Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur said his team had been given a wake-up call for their tours of New Zealand and Australia after they became the West Indies first Test victims in 18 months.
Pakistan had already clinched the series by winning the first two Tests, but Kraigg Brathwaite's heroics earned a much-needed consolation victory for the West Indies.
It is a wake-up call, Arthur told AFP. Hopefully that gives the shock to the players they needed before our tough tours to New Zealand and Australia.
West Indies won the third and final Test by five wickets in Sharjah on Thursday after they dismissed Pakistan for below-par totals of 282 and 208. Brathwaite guided his team to their first victory in 14 Tests as he became the first opener in Test history to carry his bat in both innings, compiling unbeaten scores of 142 and 60.
Pakistan will now play two Tests in New Zealand, the first in Christchurch starting from November 17 and the second in Hamilton from November 25. Pakistan then move on to Australia for a three-Test series, starting with a day-night match in Brisbane from December 15. It's a good wake-up call and just says that if you're off your discipline in international cricket at any time you can be beaten, said Arthur, who took over in May. We certainly took the pedal off the accelerator in this game and were below in standards and intensity, he added.
Arthur also warned Pakistan could expect a tough tour, starting with New Zealand who will look to hit back hard after being routed 3-0 in India last month.
Any team in their conditions is extremely hard to play, said Arthur. If you look around the international cricket at the moment there is no easy bait in their own conditions so it's going to be five tough matches for us. AFP

Aussies play down sledging problem after Hughes inquest
PERTH, Friday  Former Australia captain Mark Taylor and other senior figures Friday insisted verbal abuse is not a big problem after a coroner examining Phillip Hughes's death called it cricket's ugly underside.
Hughes, who played 26 Tests, died from bleeding on the brain in November 2014 after being hit on the neck by a rising ball while batting in a domestic match at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
During his inquest, concerns were raised by Hughes family about on-field sledging, or abuse, which they felt may have unsettled him.
On Friday, New South Wales coroner Michael Barnes said even if there had been attempts to intimidate players, Hughes did not appear to be affected and it could not be implicated in his death.
But Barnes called sledging an unsavoury aspect of cricket, adding: An outsider is left to wonder why such a beautiful game would need such an ugly underside. The hearing heard claims that one bowler told him, I am going to kill you, although players on the field said they did not recall any such comment. Taylor said he didn't think sledging was a major problem in cricket, but he urged umpires to crack down if they thought players were going too far.
I don't think we have, he said in Perth, where Australia are playing South Africa, when asked if cricket had a sledging problem. The game needs a competitive edge to it, but it doesn't need a lot or rubbish talk either. If something positive does come out of this, it will
be a reduction in the idle chat. Sledging is something that has always been talked about regularly, but the umpires should step in if they think it is over the top. Cricket Australia chief James Sutherland agreed it was down to the umpires to stamp out backchat if it was becoming too much. If it has become a problem, then I would say the umpires are not doing
their job, he said, adding that he did not see it as a problem. I come back to the fundamentals -- the game should still be played in the right spirit and for the sake of clarity, there's codes of behaviour that are in place that deal with inappropriate behaviour. When that line is crossed, people should pay the price for crossing that line and I can only encourage the umpires and relevant officials to take action when it is appropriate.
Former Australian Test opener Chris Rogers said he believed there was less sledging in the modern game, particularly in England where he feels umpires are less tolerant.
Things are changing but I dont see how it can be completely policed, he
said.
Australian Test opener David Warner, who played in the game, said he was not concerned that the coroner raised doubts about the evidence of the players on sledging in the match.
I'm happy with my testimony, Warner said. The umpire said the same thing, that there was no sledging out there. I stick to my word that there was no sledging out there. Warner claimed there was no sledging in the game these days, describing it as banter. AFP

West Indies alter squad
St Johns, ANTIGUA  Having already named their squad for the triangular series against Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka later this month the West Indies have made some last minute alterations to the group.
After his heroic performance in the Sharjah Test wicketkeeper batsman Shane Dowrich has earned an ODI call up, coming in to the squad to replace Marlon Samuels who had an average run in the Tests against Pakistan.
Samuels was one of the better batsman in the ODI series though, top scoring for the Windies with 116 runs in three matches which suggests there is more to the decision than just performance.
Dowrich has a List A record that leaves a lot to be desired having played 26 games scoring 344 runs at an average of just 18.10 and a highest score of 48. The other change to the group sees Miguel Cummins come in to the squad for young fast bowler Alzarri Joseph. Joseph is still very young but his experience is comparable to Cummins who has played just five List A games and one ODI.
To the best of our knowledge Joseph is not injured and the decision would appear to be based on performance but the late changes will no doubt draw further criticism for the under fire WICB who have made some curious choices over the last few months including firing their coach on the eve of the series against Pakistan.
West Indies squad: Sulieman Benn, Carlos Brathwaite, Kraigg Brathwaite, Darren Bravo, Jonathan Carter, Johnson Charles, Miguel Cummins, Shane Dowrich, Shannon Gabriel, Jason Holder (Captain), Shai Hope, Evin Lewis, Sunil Narine, Ashley Nurse, Rovman Powell.
