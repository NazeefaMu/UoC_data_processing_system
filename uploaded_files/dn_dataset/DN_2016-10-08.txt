Staying active at that time of the month
This past August, her exuberance, emotion and enthusiasm had already made Fu Yuanhui the most famous Chinese athlete at the Olympics.
After winning a bronze medal in the women's 100-meter backstroke with a personal best, she nearly exploded with excitement: I was so fast! I'm really pleased! I've already... expended my primordial powers! Her interview went viral with millions of hits worldwide. Then she said something truly shocking: she was having her period. Noticing that the swimmer was grimacing after her relay team narrowly missed medaling, an interviewer asked if she had a stomachache. Yuanhui answered It's because I just got my period yesterday, so I'm still a bit weak and really tired. But this isn't an excuse for not swimming well. When the New York Times, NPR and other media outlets covered the story of the Chinese swimmer who dared to mention that she was having her period as if it were the perfectly natural thing that it is, they focused on the fact that she'd violated a cultural taboo - indeed, it is virtually unheard of for women in China to publicly mention menstruation. But, they also missed an opportunity to counter the common misconception that menstruation impairs athletic performance or that it's unsafe or inappropriate to swim while having your period.
Menstruation and athletics
I recall classmates in high school sitting out basketball practice because they had their periods. I assumed it was just because they weren't feeling well. In fact, many girls have been told they are more likely to be injured, less likely to perform well, and that the best way to handle menses is to take it easy. Maybe. But the evidence for each of these is weak.
Injury Much has been made about the apparent increased incidence of significant injuries - ankle sprains, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears and others - in female athletes compared with their male counterparts. Blaming it on hormones is common.
A 1989 study interviewed 84 female soccer players and found more reports of injuries during the premenstrual period and menstrual period, especially among those with premenstrual symptoms (such as irritability or breast discomfort).
A 2007 study found that ACL injuries tended to occur more often during the first half of the menstrual cycle (in the week or two after the period). A 2009 study found that among eight healthy volunteers, hamstring flexibility increased at the mid-point of the menstrual cycle. That's the point in the cycle that estrogen levels are rising or at their highest.
So it's possible that variations in female hormones through the menstrual cycle change the function of bones, joints, tendons, or ligaments, and that these changes could have an impact on performance or likelihood of injury.
Then again, these studies are simply observations of certain patterns - they don't prove a connection between phases of the menstrual cycle and injury. In fact, we don't know for sure whether the phase of the menstrual cycle truly has an important effect on tendency for injury. And if there is an effect, it's not clear what to do about it.
Athletic performance
Studies find inconsistent effects on the impact of menstrual periods on athletic performance. For example:  +a group of swimmers were found to have poorer performance just before their periods started, and improved times during menstruation
 +cross-country skiers were best just after their periods and after ovulation (which occurs midway between periods)
in yet another study, strength of handgrip and standing long jump distance were best during menstrual periods compared with other parts of the menstrual cycle.
A 1994 analysis reviewing the available research concluded that when it comes to having your period, ...for most women there is no significant effect... medals have been won and world records set in any phase of the menstrual cycle.

Ring of steel greets Englands cricketers on tour
Its a level of security detail usually reserved solely for a President -- and Englands cricketers had better get used to it.
During its month-long tour of Bangladesh the sight of armed guards, rooftop snipers, sniffer dogs and bomb disposal units will become extremely familiar.
As the team left the ring of steel around its Dhaka hotel to venture to training, a decoy coach with blacked out windows was even deployed to confuse any would-be terrorists.
A lot has been made about the problems they had and the attacks earlier in the year but once Reg (Dickason) had given his OK then youve got to trust him, England captain Jos Buttler told journalists at his first press conference in the country.
A huge security presence greeted the Englands cricketers as they arrived in Bangladesh for a three-match series. 
Those attacks in July claimed 21 lives, 18 of them foreign nationals, when terrorists targeted a bakery popular with tourists in the capital.
Dickason is Englands team security officer, who visited the country several times before declaring it safe to tour.
Prior to Julys mass shooting, Australia canceled its tour of Bangladesh in October 2015 on government advice, then withdrew its Under-19 side from the World Cup at the beginning of 2016.
Buttler is filling in as skipper after Englands one-day captain Eoin Morgan refused to travel saying he had vowed never to put himself in a position where security would become a distraction. Opening batsman Alex Hales also opted not to go.
Despite roads being closed and armed guards accompanying the team coach on the short journey to the Sher-e-Bangla Cricket Stadium, Buttler said his players had to block out those concerns.
Visually there is a lot of security but that is part and parcel of making the tour OK and now we are here we can start focusing on the cricket, he said.
In terms of coming to places like this, I dont think its been that different from what I expected and what its been before.
The Board left no stone unturned coming here and when you walk into a room and see so many people here you understand the passion, added Buttler, referring to English crickets governing body the England and Wales Cricket Board.
If Englands players need a reminder how an international cricket team can become a high-profile target they need look no further than their head coach.
Trevor Bayliss was part of the Sri Lankan team that was ambushed by gunman on its way to a match with Pakistan in Lahore, back in 2009.
He was unhurt, but six players were injured and six Pakistani policeman and two civilians were killed in the attack. No international team has toured Pakistan since.
England play two Tests and three one-day internationals with Bangladesh, two in Dhaka and one in Chittagong, before heading to India, where it can expect similar levels of security. CNN

FIFA proposes big World Cup expansion
As though the World Cup isnt hard enough to win, FIFA president Gianni Infantino is looking to add another 16 teams to the competition.
The proposal would see a playoff round added prior to the group stages, with the 16 defeated nations going home after playing just one match.
From then on, the remaining 32 teams would progress through the tournament as usual.
The idea is that 16 teams would qualify directly to the group stage and the other 32 would play in a preliminary phase, in the country where the World Cup is being played, Infantino told reporters at an event in Bogota, Colombia.
They would play for the remaining 16 places. It means we continue with a normal World Cup for 32 teams, but 48 teams go to the party.
One of Infantinos proposals in his presidential manifesto was to increase the number of teams competing in World Cups to 40 after Qatar 2022.
A decision is set to be made on the plans at the FIFA Council Meeting in January 2017. The bidding process for the 2026 tournament had been due to take place next year, but has been put on hold amid allegations of corruption surrounding the 2018 and 2022 votes.
These are ideas to find the best solution. We will debate them this month and we will decide everything by 2017, Infantino continued. They are ideas which we put forward to see which one is the best.
FIFAs idea is to develop football in the whole world, and the World Cup is the biggest event there is, he said. Its more than a competition, its a social event.
However, Infantinos expansion plans have been met with criticism and opposition from high-profile names in the sport.
Germanys 2014 World Cup-winning coach Joachim Low told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag the addition of teams would dilute the competition.
I absolutely understand for the smaller nations who, thanks to this, could take their place on the big stage, he said.
We have to be aware that in the long run the quality will suffer. We should not overdo it. I dont think its a good idea to dilute the sporting value. CNN

Nadal overcomes Mannarinoin
Rafael Nadal is through to the quarter-finals of the China Open after defeating Adrian Mannarino in straight sets.
The 6-1, 7-6 (8-6) scoreline tells the story of the match, as Nadal raced through the first set only to be given a much sterner test in the second.
Nadal looked to be cruising after going a set and a break up, but Mannarino hit back with a break of his own to level the scores at 3-3 and then matched the Spaniard shot for shot before Nadal was finally able to clinch the victory after coming out on top in a fiercely contested tie-breaker.
I think I played a fantastic first set. Great level of tennis, serving very good, hitting so good.
During the second set, I slowed the rhythm a little bit and he played very well, said Nadal.
I feel very happy that I won that tie-break. I think I played with the right amount of determination in the tie-break. It's very important for my confidence to pass through these tough moments.
Nadal is looking to secure qualification for the ATP World Tour Finals as the season draws to a close.
He currently lies in the eighth and final automatic qualification spot, and a victory this week will provide a welcome boost.
Next up for the Spaniard is Grigor Dimitrov, who beat Lucas Pouille 6-7 (3-7), 7-6 (7-0), 6-4 in a hard-fought two-and-a-half-hour encounter.
He's a great player that is playing well. He's one of the players on tour with high potential, said Nadal. I know I have to play my best tennis to win against him, so I'm trying to focus on that. sports24

Wimbledon Match In Fixing Probe
The Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) revealed on Thursday they are investigating whether a match at this year's Wimbledon was fixed.
The TIU received an alert regarding one match played at the grass-court Grand Slam in London.
Its alerts come from regulators and betting organisations, who can report matches if they notice suspicious betting patterns.
The TIU said it received 96 alerts from July to September, of which two came in Grand Slams, the first at Wimbledon and the second at the US Open.
A TIU statement said: Historically, Grand Slams receive very few match alerts and in keeping with that record, only two were received during the period; one at Wimbledon, the other at the US Open. Both are the subject of routine, confidential investigation by the TIU.
The US Open match under investigation had already been disclosed, with the TIU having announced in September it was looking at the match between Vitalia Diatchenko and Timea Bacsinszky.
It has not given details of the Wimbledon match that is under scrutiny.
The TIU's guidance states: It is important to appreciate that an alert on its own is not evidence of match-fixing.
