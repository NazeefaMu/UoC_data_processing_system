Belt & Road initiative benefits world
The Belt & Road initiative may be Chinas idea but its opportunities and outcomes are going to benefit the world, Cultural Division Director at the Embassy of the Peoples Republic of China Liu Dong said at the opening of the Belt & Road Painting Exhibition at the J. D. A. Perera Gallery of the University of Visual and Performing Arts in Horton Place, Colombo on July 23 morning.
One hundred and two paintings specially selected from over 750 award winning work of art by teenagers living in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, and Sri Lanka are on display until July 25. The exhibition is hosted by the Association for Sri Lanka China Social and Cultural Corporation.
Liu Dong said China and Sri Lanka were good neighbours and important countries along the maritime Silk Route. It was not only a road of trade but also a road of friendship, featuring peace, openness, inclusiveness, mutual learning and win-win corporation which have linked China and Sri Lanka closely and has been a bond of friendly exchange between the people of the two nations, he said.
This year marks the fifth anniversary of the launch of the One Belt and One Road initiative by President Xi Jinping.Over the past five years, over 80 countries and international organisations have signed corporate agreement with china. Sri Lanka is among the first countries to support the One Belt and One Road initiative through a government statement. he said.
Following the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, the initiative encourages partner countries and others to combine comparative advantages, narrow development gaps, accelerate regional integration and achieve common development and prosperity by promoting the connectivity of policy, infrastructure, trade, finance and people.
China has no geopolitical calculations, seeks no exclusionary blocs and imposes no business deals on others. As President Xi said, It is not a solo for China itself but a real chorus comprising all countries along the route, he said.
He said China had said it had entered a new era. The Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China is making great efforts to realize the two century goals which are to build a moderately prosperous society in all respect by 2020 and to build China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful by middle of the century. China will continue to follow a path of peaceful development, to presume a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up to uphold justice while pursuing shared interests, to seek innovative and inclusive development that benefits everyone, safeguard world peace and contributes to global development.
China and Sri Lanka are good neighbours, good friends and good partners. Chinas friendly policy towards Sri Lanka has never changed and will not change in the future. Our friendship is built on a profound and broad popular basis and time tested. China will never peruse development interests at the expense of Sri Lanka, he said.
Vice Chancellor of the University of Visual and Performing Arts Prof. Sarath Chandrajeewa said Art and Music were a universal language and was honoured that the exhibition was held at the University.
Beijing Peoples Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (BPAFFC) President Xu Jinyu said that although there were many differences between the Chinese and Sri Lankan languages and cultures, painting was a unique language of art communication which bring them together. She said the paintings expressed the understanding of the teenagers of both countries of the Belt and Road initiative and their good longing for the friendship between China and Sri Lanka.
I hope the exhibition will convey our sincere friendship to the people of Sri Lanka and further enhance the mutual understanding of the people of China and Sri Lanka, she said.
Association for Sri Lanka China Social and Cultural Cooperation President Indrananda Abeysekera, 11-year-old Zhou Yiping, who won the first prize at the Belt & Road Painting Competition, and Sri Lankan schoolgirl Dilini Alwis, who was privileged to participate at the Belt & Road painting exhibition held in Beijing spoke.

GMOA prepared to launch strike on August 3
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) had decided to launch an island-wide strike on August 3 at 8.00 am, if it does not receive a positive response from President Maithripala Sirisena, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo, yesterday, he said that the GMOA expected the President to hold immediate discussions with them, adding that if he were to not respond positively, the proposed strike would be launched. Dr. Aluthge said the strike would affect both state and private sector medical services.
"The government has imposed four taxes on patients. The government should notand cannotconsider people falling ill as a reason to impose taxes," he added.
According to Dr. Aluthge, there was no positive response, or any response whatsoever, from President Sirisena or the relevant Health officials for the 10 demands recently presented by the GMOA in writing.
"Turning a deaf ear to demands will lead to an island-wide strike. One of the main demands presented by the GMOA was restricting the tax limit to 12 percent for professionals. Currently, ministers import vehicles valued at Rs. 460 million using tax money paid by professionals," he said, adding that tax on doctors' vehicles had been increased, while their transport allowances remained unchanged.
Making arrangements to sign more Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with several countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and India without having a proper national policy on signing such agreements, was another main reason to launch the strike, Dr. Aluthge said; the FTA signed with Singapore was unacceptable as it posed possible adverse effects on the Sri Lankan economy.

Beauty hacks to get that  perfect selfie
When it comes to social media, everyones Facebook and Instagram is flooded selfies as you scroll down the feed. And, if you still havent mastered the art of clicking selfies, then were here to help. A lot of times your make-up looks good in real life, while your photos look the opposite. Here are 8 tips that will help you to get the perfect shot:
Skip SPF
If you have applied sunscreen or any product which has SPF in it, it can ruin your photos with flash. So, avoid photos with flash during the day and skip SPF cream during the night for flash photos.Like the way sunscreen reflects the UV rays, it will also reflect the flash night, ruining your photos.
The angle matters
To get the perfect selfie and avoid the double chin, always elevate the phone while clicking a photo. Angle the phone camera with your forehead to get the perfect selfie!
Get the perfect smile
While getting clicked, make sure you dont over smile, it can show lines on the face and even make your eyes look small. You can try the hack of sticking your tongue behind your teeth and gums wont show too much!
Check your foundation
A lot of times a wrong shade of foundation can ruin your photograph. Look for a foundation that matches your skin tone just perfectly. You can test the colour by clicking a selfie and and seeing if the shade is perfect.
Avoid greasy hair
Oily hair can ruin your photo unless you turn it into a slicked back hairdo. If you havent washed your hair, you can spray a little bit of dry shampoo to give your roots a little volume at the front.
Apply some blush
Sometimes your face can look too flat in the photos. A little blush can help you look youthful and even glow in the photos!
Dont blink too much!
If you blink too much in photos, close your eyes before the photo is clicked for a few seconds. This hack will avoid too much blinking.
Just apply one bold colour
If you have applied one bold colour like your lips, avoid too much colour on your eyes. Stick to one bold colour in your face.

Establishing a record in transshipment operations the Port of Colombo has witnessed the highest growth of 19.8% in transshipment container throughput for the first half in 2018 as against the corresponding period in 2017.
During the first half of 2018, the Port of Colombo handled 2,733,906 TEUs of transshipment containers as against 2,281,636 TEUs handled in the corresponding period in 2017. The state owned Jaya Container Terminal (JCT) of Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), also witnessed the highest growth of 20.6% in transshipment container throughput for the first half in 2018 as against the corresponding period in 2017.
During the first half of 2018, the transshipment volume handled by Jaya Container Terminal (JCT) reached 935,848 TEUs compared to 776,002 TEUs handled for the same period in 2017.
The Port of Colombo expects to reach the 7 million TEU target by the end this year. In a recent statement, Minister of Ports and Shipping Mahinda Samarasinghe added that the port would take new initiatives forward to promote the Port of Colombo internationally, together with all stake holders and to attract more new shipping lines that work in alliances.
Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the terminals of the Port of Colombo that include the state owned Jaya Container Terminal (JCT), the South Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT) and the Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) to operate collectively to promote the Port of Colombo.
Expressing views the Chairman of SLPA Dr.Parakrama Dissanayake said that the terminals would compete with each other but would also co-operate with each other moving between competition and co-operation. On the Asia to Europe sector there are 17 loops of which only three are calling Colombo. Therefore, obviously, we have got challenges to ensure that collectively we should attract more loops into the Port of Colombo. This means, we have to go beyond the partisan approach of promoting our terminals to protect the Port of Colombo, the Chairman said. According to internationally recognized global ranking indexes, the Port of Colombo is positioned as the worlds 23rd best container port and the 13th best connectivity port in the world at present.
Following Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe assuming office as the Minister of Ports and Shipping, an exclusive 3 year plan was introduced to develop the entire port sector to establish Sri Lanka as the most preferred maritime gateway to South Asia.

Colour-changing FAKE NAILS
Raise your hands if you are one of those who have a problem picking up a nail paint colour with so much to choose from. Imagine if you could switch between multiple shades anytime you want that too without repainting your nails!
Doobys Nails, a UK-based nail polish brand founded by Hayley Edwards makes fake nails that are absolutely reusable and can change colours with the help of a little water.
It is the use of various pigments that makes it change its colour.
Edwards told MarieClaire.com, The polish is a thermal-changing polish. The nails are one colour at room temperature, but the pigments will lighten and change color once they are put into slightly warmer water. It looks like a Harry Potter trick, but its actually the result of heat-sensitive pigments and dyes interacting with one another in the formula.
One look at the brands Instagram page and youll see videos of pointy claws painted in various hues and changing colour in a bowl of water. Black nails changing into white, purple into fuschia, maroon into red and so on. These nails can be attached using any nail glue or gel nail tabs and can be easily removed as well.

CONSTRUCTION OF US$ 250 MN  PLANT PROCEEDING RAPIDLY
Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama visited the Rigid Tyre Corporation (Pvt) Ltd factory site which is being built at the BOI Wagawatte Industrial Park.
The factory represents a total investment of US$ 250 million with the possibility of increasing to as much as US$ 300 million.
The project will adhere to all environmental protection measures.Since the company is located within the premises of the Wagawatte Industrial Park, an environmental approval has been obtained from the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) by an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). This complies with the National Environment Requirements. The company will also introduce advanced environmentally friendly technology.
In economic terms the project is also very significant. It will create 3,000 direct employment opportunities and possibly three times as many indirect jobs.
In addition new opportunities for local entrepreneurs have arisen including the construction of dormitories, transport, supply of materials and other services.
The production of tyres will also boost the demand and create increased value for Sri Lankan natural rubber.
The Minister has a brief discussion with investor Nandana Lokuwithana. Mangala Yapa, Board member of BOI, Duminda Ariyasinghe, Director General of the BOI and other senior officials of the Board also accompanied Minister. In addition a number of key institutions including the Road Development Authority, Ceylon Electricity Board and other state institutions also participated. The objective of the meeting was to look at all aspects and potential challenges a project of this nature which is a joint Sri Lanka and Chinese investment, would face when it is completed in an estimated six months.
Minister Samarawickrama said, We can see the development that is now taking place. Every effort must be made to ensure from the BOI that this project is monitored in every way and that very high standards are met.It is for this reason that we have brought together not just the BOI but also the Central Environmental Authority, the Ceylon Electricity Board, Road Development Authority and the Water Board together with key officials of the BOI to look at all aspects of this project an ensure that it is successfully completed. When a project like this is operational it will send a very powerful signal to other enterprises to follow suit by investing. From our side we will ensure that this project will receive all the support needed, especially with some of the vital utilities that are required. We can also showcase this project as a success story to attract other global investors.
The discussion also covered some of the infrastructure that needs to be established including the road access to the project, supply of power and of water and other matters. In addition it was agreed that regular meetings would be held with the purpose of monitoring the progress of the project.
Minister Samarawickrama also said the project will meet all environmental standards particularly in the use of waste water and Central Environmental Authority would play an important role in maintaining the high standards required.
Sri Lankas exports of rubber products including tyres are worth US$876 million (7.5% of total exports).

Court refuses to release elephants of suspect owners
The Colombo Chief Magistrate last Friday (20) refused to release 11 elephants being kept without a valid licence to its claimants, since the claimants had been named as the suspects in the case.
The elephant owners whose elephants had been taken into Wildlife Department custody over possession without valid licences had sought an order to release the 11 elephants to take part in the upcoming peraheras.
Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake observed that this request can be considered if a party like the Diyawadana Nilame or a person who can take responsibility had made the request.
Prosecutors maintained that 38 illegally caught wild elephants have been taken into Wildlife Department custody following CID investigations into a racket where wild elephant calves have been illegally caught and sold to third parties.
The prosecutors alleged that the suspect Samarappulige Niraj Roshan alias Ali Roshan was the mastermind behind the racket where wild elephant calves which were illegally caught were being sold to third parties. The prosecutors alleged investigations revealed that the suspect was directly involved in selling 39 wild elephants and the captured elephants calves were sold over a period of 15 years.

Dawn of a new age in agriculture
The filling of the Kalu Ganga reservoir under the Kalu Ganga-Moragahakanda Project, was inaugurated by the President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday. The project, which is the final phase of the Mahaweli Project, spans an area of over 666,000 acre-feet.
The Mahaweli Multipurpose Project was inaugurated at Polgolla in the Central Province by then Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike on January 8, 1976.
Thousands of acres in the North Central, North Western, Central and Eastern Provinces would be brought under plough under this project.
The Kalu Ganga-Moragahakanda reservoir is six times larger than the Parakrama Samudraya constructed centuries ago by King Parakramabahu I.
Realising the long-felt need for water in the countrys agricultural heartland, the Kalu Ganga-Moragahakanda Reservoir Project, the biggest irrigation project in the country, was brought forward by the present government under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena. The mega project would provide a long-lasting solution to water scarcity in five districts, among other benefits.
The project proposal was stagnating for decades until President Sirisena, as the then Mahaweli Development Minister, took measures to revive it in 2007. The project included the construction of two giant reservoirs: Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga. The Moragahakanda Reservoir was commissioned by the President in January.
President Maithripala Sirisena unveiled a granite Buddha statue the near the reservoir and offered a tray of flowers amidst chanting of seth pirith by the Maha Sangha.
The President also inaugurated the operation of the Moragahakanda hydroelectric power station, which would add 25 megawatts of power to the national grid. He also declared the Moragahakanda reservoir as the Kulasinghe reservoir at the ceremony.

Emmy nod puts John Legend one step closer to EGOT status
John Legend is a step closer to becoming one of the few to land an EGOT after scoring two Emmy nominations on July 12.
The star received two nods for his work on the live telecast of Jesus Christ Superstar - as the show's lead and producer - and now he's on the verge of becoming the latest member of an exclusive club of elites who have picked up an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony prize.
The All of Me hitmaker, who co-produced the hit TV musical alongside composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, is excited by the idea of accepting an award on Emmy night. "If it happens, it would be a truly rare group of people to join," Legend told Vulture of his EGOT dreams. "To do it with Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice would be especially cool, given that this was their show from the beginning. According to them, weve done their favourite production in the history of the show." The acclaimed Jesus Christ Superstar is nominated for 13 Emmys, the most of any live TV musical. Legend's fellow cast members Sara Bareilles and Brandon Victor Dixon are also up for a trophy.
For all three of us, as actors, to get nominated is pretty incredible, Legend added.
Legend previously earned a Tony for producing a revival of Jitney on Broadway last year (17) and he took home an Oscar for Best Original Song (Glory) in 2015. He has also scored multiple Grammy Awards over the years, starting with the Best New Artist trophy in 2005. Audrey Hepburn, Whoopi Goldberg, Barbra Streisand, and James Earl Jones are among the select few who have earned EGOT status. Rolling Stone

Getting the right prices is an art, a science and bit of technology
One of the biggest challenges for any business is pricing. It affects so many different departments, making it difficult to pinpoint exactly who has control. Often, the product lines set the prices that go on the price list, but the CEO, CFO or some other executive sets the overall pricing strategy for the company. The sales department negotiates to get the final price for large customers. It seems like everyone in the company is involved in pricing.
The common theme with most pricing issues is risk; if you set prices too high you may push potential customers away, prices too low will cut your profits. This is known as pricing paradox. However, risk in most cases can be eliminated by getting better information about your market, your customers and your own internal numbers that drive your profit.
There is a typical pricing cycle that takes place in most businesses. In some markets this cycle is spread over many years and in very competitive markets sometimes it can all happen in a single week. The company has to keep a sharp eye on this cycle and carry out frequent audits pulling together all the available data and insights.
The pricing objectives should be relatively straight forward and flow from your company strategy. The next challenge is to select one or more pricing strategies and then the appropriate pricing structures and price levels to meet the objectives. In many instances these will already be well understood and whats required is just a tweak to the current pricing levels. Finally, once the pricing has been approved by the business it must be implemented and the cycle can begin again.
The audit may consist answering few questions: What are your current forecasts and targets How should your product be supporting company strategy Have you analyzed current sales e.g. Profit/loss, discounting What are the competitor propositions What are your costs What market research is needed to predict demand Do you understand what customers value in your proposition
Product pricing
There are many ways to price a product. Lets have a look at some of them.
1.Cost plus pricing
In practice, a lot of companies calculate their cost of production, determine their desired profit margin by pulling a number out of thin air, slap the two numbers together and then stick it on a couple thousand widgets. Cost-plus pricing maybe really simple but involves very little market research, and also doesnt take into consideration consumer demands and competitor strategies. Therefore, it is quite ineffective.
2.Competitive based pricing
This is a lot like piracy  your son decides not to do your homework, so he copies that of those who have already done some work. Obviously, the market doesnt dole out suspensions for copying prices, but the processes of swiping an essay and competitor-based pricing are pretty similar.
Also called strategic pricing, this method involves looking at the prices set by other businesses in the same sector and then adopting those numbers, plus or minus a few percent according to how your product looks that day. You rely on your competitors to do the work for you. As long as you trust they actually know whats going on in the market, it works.
Competitive based pricing remains low risk way of quickly gauging prices, and in some cases it can be fairly accurate. Yet, it leads to enormously large missed opportunities, because companies employing the strategy end up not assessing their true value and get caught in a race to the bottom through industry group think.
3.Value based pricing
This works to determine the true willingness to pay of a target customer for a particular product by utilizing customer data. It recognizes that customers do not care how much something cost you to make but they care how much value they are receiving at a particular price. By maintaining this customer focus, value-based pricing provides real data, helps you develop higher quality products, and even improves customer loyalty. Simply put, you have the greatest amount of data to make an informed decision about your profit maximizing price.
a. Identification
To arrive at the optimum value-based price, determine how highly your customers value your product or service. Examine factors such as whether your customers will save money or time by using your product or service; whether your product or service is unique; whether your product or service will help customers gain a competitive advantage; and what the competition charges. The answers to these questions will help you determine what customers are willing to pay for your product or service.
b. Effects
When you are offering a product or service that is not unique and in a market, where prices are well established, you may have to adopt the strategy of setting your price at the same level as your competitors. This may help you to enter the market, but you will need to lower your costs to raise your profit levels above your competitors, to gain a competitive advantage.
c. Insight
For some products and services, it may make sense to set your prices according to how much you will save your customers. For example, a company, selling gaskets that prevent chemical leaks and spills, charges customers based on the clean-up costs they will avoid by using the product.
d. Considerations
For certain products or services, it may make sense to charge a higher amount relative to your costs. You can do this if your product is unique, if you are positioning your product as a high-status item or if it will save your customers money. For example, many luxury items, such as designer handbags, are priced at hundreds of times their production cost, but customers are paying for the prestige of owning the brand. Drug companies may price their products high and justify this by arguing their drug can save the patient an even more expensive medical procedure.
e. Potential
Another type of value-based pricing strategy is to offer some customers a discount. This may be based on the amount they buy or on how often they use your service. Airlines, trains and hotels use a related strategy of pricing seats or rooms differently depending on when customers buy the tickets. When there are seats left to fill very close to the departure date, the airline is willing to sell these at a discount in order to fill the plane. This helps to maintain profitability.
4. Psychological pricing
This is a pricing strategy that helps create a positive psychological impact on buyers and tempts them to purchase a product. A common example is about a brand of footwear charging Rs. 1490.00 instead of Rs. 1500.00 for a pair of shoes. The theory is that even though there is just a ten-rupee off, customers will believe they are getting a much better deal and will be more likely to buy the product.
This type of pricing can also lead customers to believe that the goods are priced at the lowest possible level and the retailer has squeezed the price down as much as he can.
Other examples are when companies have special offers such as buy one get one free or buy two get the third item free. This type of pricing works because customers believe they are getting a good deal and although this is true in some cases, people can often end up buying products they dont really need as they believe the offer is too good to miss.
Avoiding pricing mistakes and being strong in your pricing proposition go hand-in-hand in building a profitable business. Master the so-called pricing paradox and you will master an area of business in which even the most experienced entrepreneurs sometimes struggle to get the final price for large customers. It seems like everyone in the company is involved in pricing.
Tips
As you can see, changing pricing therefore takes buy-in from many different groups who do not always have the same beliefs about what needs fixing. But if youre passionate about maximizing the results of your companys pricing strategy, here are a few tips that can help you spear-head those efforts.
Engage in one-on-one conversations - a lot of them. You are not trying to convince anyone of anything, at least at first. Listen to their issues around pricing and ask questions like these: What would you change about the way we price What about our pricing is costing us money How can we quantify how much we are losing
Many people in the company have similar answers, and this is common ground you can build on. Where you have different beliefs and assumptions, dig for a deeper understanding. It often provides new ways to look at the situation.
For example, let us say you want to start using rebates in your pricing repertoire. Your finance team adamantly objects, saying they do not work. Ask them why. Do not be challenging, though; be curious. They have their opinion for a reason - and it may be right. Perhaps they tried rebates several years ago and lost control of the process or were writing checks that were not really deserved. Learning the reasoning can prove useful.

President inaugurates release of water to Kalu ganga reservoir
Giant leap for Agri-Economy
The Moragahakanda- Kalu Ganga project will spur a massive development drive to rejuvenate the countrys agricultural hinterland, President Maithripala Sirisena declared in Laggala yesterday, presiding over the water filling ceremony of the Kalu Ganga reservoir. Today is the happiest day in my life, said President Sirisena, adding that the water scarcity faced by the Rajarata inhabitants will now be a thing of the past. Someone could ask me whether the day I became President was not the happiest day in my life.
On that I felt a sense of duty to the Motherland, but this is undoubtedly the happiest occasion. Noting the project would herald in a new chapter in the countrys agri-based economy, the President told the large gathering that the water filling ceremony will mark a giant leap forward in irrigation, with the entire project adding a value amounting Rs 200,000 million to the national economy.
Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga is not an isolated project as it will be followed by several other irrigation and hydropower projects such as giant canal systems, Upper Elahera Ela and a few others.
Moreover, the scheme will be a feeder source for more than 2,000 tanks to provide water for thousands of acres of paddy and other cultivations.
The President said the Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga reservoir development scheme is a permanent solution to wipe away the tears of the Rajarata people, who were affected by an acute scarcity of water for decades as there was no proper irrigation system.
Her recalled that even though he commenced the project on January 25, 2007 as the then Mahaweli Development Minister, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not give any support or assistance to carry out the project.
He made an untiring effort to seek funds, but was not allocated even a cent for the project. As a result of that, the project was stagnating for five years. Even five years after laying the foundation, it could not be started. It was scheduled to release water for irrigation in 2012  2013 if the project went ahead as planned.
The President said that however certain persons are now trying to be the fathers of this project but they did not give any support even by word when he made efforts to make the project a success.
As a gratitude for the late engineer Dr. A.N.S. Kulasinghe, I came to see this place in 1994. But those who want to be fathers of the project were not there. These persons did not add the project even to the list of the Foreign Resources Department of Foreign Ministry.
The President said that it a major reason for his crossing over and becoming the common candidate in January 2015.
The President pointed out that Sri Lanka has inherited a sound irrigation system and a unique hydro culture, which is not second to any in the world. As a result of these sound technological methods of our ancestors in the field of irrigation this giant scheme will also be a historic achievement.
The President while thanking to the people who sacrificed their lands for the project said that they have made a unique contribution to the country and to strengthen countrys economy. It will be a tremendous boost for the governments effort to obtain sustainability in various sectors, including the agriculture sector. He said that as a result of the cordial ties the country maintains with the world several countries and organisations came forward to assist the project. Accordingly, countries like Japan, China, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and organisations such as ADB assisted the project.
President Sirisena speaking on the media said that the media should be impartial and must always bring the correct picture to society than trying the fabricated picture among people while acting with their hidden agendas.
The President noted that under his governance media freedom was established.
When you watch or listen to certain private electronic media some can think whether there is no Government in the county. I must ask the heads of these media institutions whether they want to bring the dark era of media freedom again. If such a period comes you must repent, the President said.
The Moragahakanda project completed at US$ 1,150 million will end the water scarcity in several districts including Matale, Polonnaruwa, Vavuniya and Anuradhapura. The Rajarata channel system is 102 km long and will connect to the Mahakanadarawa Tank via Huruluwewa. The construction of the 96 km long Wayamba Channel system will commence in February.
The project cost of US$ 200 million has already been allocated. Both channel systems will supply water to 1,500 small tanks in the Dry Zone. Upon completion of the two channel systems, around 94,000 hectares of paddy land can be cultivated throughout the year.
Apart from providing water for agriculture purposes, the project will provide drinking water to millions in the dry zone who are severely affected by health issues such as kidney disease.
The project will also add 25 Megawatts to the National Grid through the power house attached to the main dam of Moragahakanda.
According to Mahaweli Authority sources, the water capacity of Moragahakanda reservoir is four times that of the ancient Parakrama Samudraya in Polonnaruwa while the water capacity of Kalu Ganga reservoir is two times bigger.
Parallel to the water filling ceremony, the construction of the Moragahakanda  Kalu Ganga tunnel, which links the two reservoirs to each other will commence.

Government push for electric three-wheelers
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera and Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma jointly launched Sri Lankas first electric three wheelers yesterday in an effort to bring down transportation costs and to encourage transition to environmentally friendly transportation alternatives. Speaking at the launch of the "Electric Tuk Tuk" at the Waters' Edge Hotel yesterday, Finance Minister Samaraweera said with more than one million three-wheeler drivers in Sri Lanka, the three-wheeler industry is indeed a major sector of the country. The Sri Lankan tuk has in fact become something of an icon as it is used in myriad aspects. It is an affordable means of transport for small business, providing last mile connectivity for SMEs and entrepreneurs. Three wheelers are a means of affordable private transportation as well, and are increasingly popular in the tourism industry. The government of Sri Lanka has recognised the importance of this sector to the economy and intends to further empower those involved in the industry. In the 2018 budget, Finance Minister Samaraweera proposed to introduce the tourist friendly tuk-tuk concept in collaboration with the hospitality industry. This programme provides for existing three-wheeler drivers to register with the SLTDA so that a three-wheeler would not only be a mode of transportation, but the driver to serve as a local tourist-guide as well. This policy was initiated to create a win-win situation for all stakeholders involved and improve the quality of services provided in the tourism industry. This program is now being implemented successfully with 589 drivers joining the training programmes already. The introduction of electric three-wheelers to this industry is another important new policy. Minister Samaraweera said, there are several reasons for the shift from the fossil fuel tuk to the electric version, and environmental concerns are chief amongst them. As part of the Paris agreement, Sri Lanka has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10% in the transport sector by 2020. Among the host of recommendations, one way to achieve this reduction is to convert the existing vehicles to zero-emission vehicles, which would cause minimum levels of pollution and carbon footprint. The number of three-wheelers in Sri Lanka has increased eight-fold since the year 2,000. The fuel consumption per person has increased from 90 litres to 150 litres during the same time. In 2017, Sri Lanka spent nearly USD 3.5 billion to import fossil fuels for the generation of electricity and transportation. This is equivalent to around 4% of GDP. Therefore, Sri Lanka needs a longer term sustainable solution to mitigate the negative environmental consequences that arise as well as a solution to minimise the forex outflows from the country. As a result, the vehicle policy in the 2018 budget too was designed to incentivise to move to a greener fleet of vehicles. The excise tax is structured such that diesel and petrol vehicles are taxed at a higher rate, making hybrids and electric vehicles more attractive. The loan to value ratio for electric and hybrid vehicles is also more favourable to encourage this segment of the market. Additionally, the import taxes on a diesel three-wheeler will be increased by Rs. 50,000 to encourage the transition to environmentally friendly alternatives.Furthermore, under the Enterprise Sri Lanka credit schemes, the Ministry of Finance will incorporate a subsidised loan scheme to enable three-wheeler drivers to invest in a multitude of additional services including meters, WIFI, GPS facilities, that would act as value-added services that are already provided to consumers; both domestic and tourists.We are also developing a proposal to encourage entrepreneurship amongst the spouses of three wheeler drivers, he said. The electric three-wheeler has been developed by Japan Sri Lanka Comprehensive Partnership secretariat and T-PLAN, with the incorporation of some of the cutting-edge technology available in this industry. The first batch of electric three wheelers manufactured in Sri Lanka will be ready by mid-2020, in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. It is very exciting to hear that T-PLAN hopes to export the Sri Lankan made electricvehicles to Japan. This would be the first of many technology transferprojects that are currently being incubated by the Japan Sri Lanka Comprehensive Partnership secretariat, the Minister said.

Government will not tolerate drug cartels: Patali
President Maithripala Sirisena had not tolerated drug cartels under his Good Governance Government, unlike former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did during his regime, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
He added that during the Rajapaksa regime, mobs, moonshine dealers and drug kingpins were protected, while those unaffiliated with the state were suppressed and persecuted.
He was addressing a gathering following the inauguration of several development projects in the Kataragama area.
The minister said that there were allegations that drug-related offences were currently on the rise, while ministers and parliamentarians had been aiding and abetting mobs and drug cartels. The minister challenged anyone to prove that those allegations were in fact true.
"If a minister or MP were to commit such an offence, the government would take immediate action against them," Minister Ranawaka said.
The minister added that the highest number of crimes recorded in the country had been committed in 2013, during the Rajapaksa regime, when Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was the Secretary of Defence.
"The number of crimes in 2013 was 55,000, which included murders, abductions and drug-trafficking," Minister Ranawaka said, "But the number of crimes in 2017 had dropped to 30,000."
He said that people were not murdered on roads in broad day light, adding that at present, there were no white vans to abduct people, similar to the situation during the previous regime.
The minister opened several shopping stalls at Sellakataragama, visited the Selalkataragama park and laid the the foundation stones for the Sellakataragama Mahasen Temple's entrance to commence the third phase of the Entrance Square to the Kataragama.
Minister Ranawaka said that the construction of the Selalkataragama park was nearing completion ad was estimated to cost Rs. 50 million. He added Rs. 500 million would be spent to develop the Kataragama area.
Three hundred shopping stalls were currently being constructed in Kataragama to replace the old, he said, adding that no political affiliations would be considered when the shops would completed. Owners of the stalls that were removed would be provided with new stalls, irrespective of their political affiliations, the minister said.
Sanitary issues in the Kataragama area would also be resolved during the following year, he said.
"The Moneragala district is the poorest district in the country. Therefore, we would pay special attention to develop this area systematically," Minister Ranawaka said.
Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara also participated in the event.

International Forum for Teachers held at BMICH
The International Forum for Teachers (IFT) organised by Gateway Graduate School, in partnership with Pearson Edexcel and the University of Nottingham, was held at the BMICH, recently.
During the event, in recognition of the services of Sri Lankan teachers, a Sri Lankan Teacher of the Year award was presented to Asith Muthukumara Jayarathna from St. Anthonys Maha Vidyalaya in Dhaluwa, Puttalam. The award was created with financial assistance from former cricketer Aravinda de Silva, who had provided Rs. 1 million for the endeavour.
Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa was the chief guest at the event, while Education Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi was the guest of honour.
The remainder of the five finalists listed for the award were T. Sandya Mendis from Pahalagiribawa Primary School in Galgamuwa, Hewayalage Suneetha Irangani from Dehiattakandiya Madya Maha Vidyalaya, S. M. G. S. Muhandiram from Palmadulla Dharmaloka Maha Vidyalaya, and L. H. M. Gayan Gunathilaka from Gamini Central College in Nuwara Eliya.
The judging process was carried out by senior Education Ministry officials, including Additional Planning and PR Secretary Madura Wehalla, Management and Quality Assurance Director Kumari Seneviathne, Teacher Education Administration Director M. F. N. Harija, and Tamil School Division Director S. Muralidaran, with assistance from Head of Gateway Graduate Schools Faculty of Education and Teacher Training Hasini Gajadeera.
Addressing the event, Minister Sajith Premadasa said that teachers had to continuously update themselves to meet the challenges of the changing world. In that respect, he said it was commendable to see what Gateway and IFT were offering to the teaching community. As the chief guest, he said he was obliged to add value to the good work that was being carried out by teachers countrywide, and offered land and houses to the five finalists.
Recalling the influence his former principal and his late father had in his life, Aravinda de Silva said that all Sri Lankans were grateful to their teachers and pledged his commitment to continue to develop the Sri Lankan Teacher of the Year award. He said it was his dream to witness a Sri Lankan teacher winning the global award one day, in the same manner the countrys cricketers won the world cup in 1996.
Gateway Group Chairman Dr. Harsha Alles said all the efforts were aimed at elevating the statuses of teachers as well as to boost their professionalism. He said that if Sri Lanka was to be competitive in the global landscape, the country would require to attract a larger number of talented youth to the profession.

Jaffna re-visited
One cannot but agree with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe when he, recalling the glory days of the north, at the launch of the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme in Jaffna, said that the north was only rivaled by Colombo in the past before the war destroyed the socio-economic fabric of the region. Jaffna also had the best education system in the past but now all those educators were living overseas, he said. Attending the event exactly 35 years since Black July, the Premier did not fail to recall the unfortunate happenings, adding that the legacy of the war still lingered and the country was still in post war recovery.
Like the PM said, Jaffna, at one time, boasted of an industrious people who were the envy of their counterparts in the south. The northerner laid great store in education and most of the best products in the professions hailed from the north. Some of the best doctors patronized by the elite in Colombo came from the north and the same went for members in the teaching profession, engineers, accountants etc. The missionary schools in Jaffna boasted of such a reputation, the well to do parents in the south sent their offspring to these seats of learning to be groomed for the future. Leading politicians of a latter day such as Cabinet ministers E. L. B. Hurulle, A. M. S. Adhikari and Speaker of Parliament K. B. Ratnayake had their schooling in these missionary schools in the north, the last mentioned even excelling as a cricketer at St.Henry's in Point Pedro.
The people of Jaffna were also known for their legendary hospitality and during the pre-war years it was customary for Sinahala families in the south to visit their friends in the north and return with fond memories of these visits, sometimes laden with the specialties of the north such as the famous Jaffna mangoes and the murungas. Though visits to the north by sports teams in the schools and clubs, and, also, reciprocal visits, had been revived once again this was a regular feature in the past which brought together youth of different backgrounds and cultures that went a long way in fostering amity and concord between the two communities.
As mentioned already, the Jaffna people were an enterprising lot and nowhere was this spirit more evident than in the sphere of agriculture. The fact that the bulk of the onions, dried chilies and pulses came to the south from Jaffna, in the past, says much for this enterprise of the Jaffna farmer who had to toil on arid and inhospitable terrain for his cultivation. In fact the Jaffna farmers showed their gratitude for this gesture when they welcomed Presidential candidate Hector Kobbekaduwe with a garland made of dried chilies during his visit to the north on the campaign trail.
Not only that, most politicians from the north also adorned the Cabinets of all governments before the outbreak of hostilities. The Thiruchelvams, Kumarasuriars and the Sunderalingams, served the country with great aplomb in their capacities as Cabinet ministers rubbing shoulders with their Sinhala colleagues. Alas, this camaraderie was put paid to as the separatist cry gained ground in later years and distrust and suspicion taking its place. This also saw the end to the collective effort to build the country, unlike in the past, where members of all communities worked hand in hand towards achieving common goals as they did together in the Independence struggle.
Therefore, every effort should be made to revive this spirit. In this respect the current reconciliation process should be fast tracked and all impediments standing in the way in this regard should be removed. There are racist elements, both, in the north and south, who will not hesitate to destroy whatever progress that is being made. Such elements should be identified and dealt with severely. Already certain politicians in the south have started beating the communal drum teaming up with likeminded media institutions. Reports have been appearing in certain anti-government newspapers of government plans to downsize the army and attempts to withdraw some 45 army camps in the north. This, amidst repeated denials by government spokesmen. Clearly attempts are being made to revive the ghosts of the past and derail the peace process.
Like the Premier noted, the country was still in post war recovery and it will be difficult to erase the scars overnight. The legacy of the war still lingered, because even though the war ended in 2009, peace had remained elusive. So many people are still missing, we need to figure out how to resolve this issue, he stated, adding that it was important to work together to put the country on the right track. He said; extremism won and the country lost. But we can catch up.
There certainly is a lot of catching up to do. The healing of hearts and minds should be given priority in this respect. This should go in tandem with the rebuilding and development of the north.
Many retired government servants still write for newspapers columns recalling those tranquil and leisurely times in Jaffna which gives the reader a picture of what the north was like then.

A juggle can spell trouble with a kiss and cuddle!
One of my columns some time ago about juggles, giggles and jiggles generated a lot of feedback. Naturally most of the queries were focused on my dexterity at balancing balls. In the first place I did not profess to be an expert in the art. I conceded that I was essentially only a two balls act man, which is basically an accepted fact. All I said was: So I practiced juggling two balls at a time until I was blue in the face.
Besides I also explained that it was certainly a far more agreeable proposition than suffering painfully battered chests that left one branded with a darker black-and blue hue. No! For the last time let me tell you I am not one of those super jugglers whose hands can explode in a dizzying frenzy of spinning twirling balls or other objects to entertain audiences.
Yet it is true that some people are born with faster reflexes than others. And others must practice to attain a quicker reaction time to stimuli.Any neurologist will tell you that practice can speed up nerve conditioning. This is the key to reaction time, whether in sports, learning skills, or work. With regular practice, a movement almost mimics a reflex, according to experts. Also, our reflexes may slow with age.
These also vary from person to person, in regard to reflex and reaction time. You can either slow down, or reverse the effects of ageing by staying physically active. Remember this old adage still holds good: If you dont use it, youll lose it!
I for one have never lost it yet.After all, life is a juggling act that sometimes requires that you drop everything, apart from your cascading balls, and concentrate on the act. That is unless until you become so good at it that you are able to do it with your eyes closed.
And you had better possess an ability to talk fast and hum, sing or whistle while you are at it. Even if you are only attempting a two ball toss make sure you do it with confidence and panache. You might as well forget attempting to juggle if you are the type of close-fisted, close-minded and closed-mouthed individual.
But I sometimes do play for laughs in public places such as supermarkets. Recently when I was out grocery shopping I noticed at least a half-dozen bored kids lounging around their parents. I grabbed a pair of similar sized oranges and soon began juggling them while whistling The Yellow Rose of Texas. I soon had their complete attention focused on my act. I did not want to take the risk of boring them with my limited two-balls repertoire. So I replaced the oranges and fished out two eggs from their cardboard packing and performed the double egg toss- up.
There were several interjecting impressed whoops of wows and other exclamations of amazement. A shop supervisor looked on his mouth agape. He dared not move lest he disturb my concentration and risk retrieving a messy yukky omelette decoction off the floor. A little boy around six boldly walked up to me and inquired:  Can I do that Can you teach me I turned around, faced my little impromptu fan club and spewed out my mandatory disclaimer: Do not try this at home or at your local supermarket.
Some of our body reactions are deliberate and conscious. Others are automatic reflex actions. Catching a dropped object, for instance, includes an element of reflex reaction.Actually the speed of your reactions can play a large part in your everyday life. Fast reaction times can produce big rewards, such as catching a falling cup. We would all love to be able to reflexively save something or someone.
It wasnt long ago when I was grocery shopping in Oregon, in the good old US and A that my reflexes were tested twice in under a minute. I was next in line and the elderly lady at the checkout counter was serving the customer ahead of me. She nonchalantly lifted a bottle of premium whisky and casually flashed it across the scanner.
As she was about to deposit it in a plastic bag it appeared to have a mind of its own. It somehow left her hand and made a twirling curve towards the tiled floor. I instinctively dropped on one knee and snatched it in midair, inches from disaster.
There were several congratulatory oohs and aahs from the shoppers behind me and the parallel queues. The counter lady thanked me as I handed it back to her intact exclaiming: Amazing! That was a super lucky catch. It would have made a terrible mess if it had hit the floor! I agreed that it would have been a waste of good liquor and a time-consuming clean up job. I however disagreed with her contention, although modestly refraining from telling her, that luck had nothing to do with it.
Almost on cue as she continued with her checking and scanning another object slipped out of her seemingly buttery hand and made an arcing trajectory for what seemed another shattering crash-landing. She had unintentionally launched a large jar of maple syrup into the stratosphere. This time I impulsively stuck my foot out and gave it an upward flick with my boot. The glass jar spun back in space from its gravitational pull and I juggled it with one hand and clasped it with the other.
I tossed it high in the air with my left hand to my right and handed it back to her exclaiming: Just twice lucky, maam! Any more for the show The onlookers expressed their approval with a roar of mirthful laughter.
I was heading out of the counter carrying a two-bag load when I felt a tap on my shoulder. I spun around on my heel surprised to be confronted by the mature checkout dame. I forgot to thank you properly, she exclaimed while standing on tiptoe and planting two thunderous smackeroos on my face. I was helplessly straitjacketed holding on to my two grocery bags.
The moral of the story: A successful juggle can get you into trouble with an unwanted snuggle and a cuddle!

Khan is actively promoting Karwaan
Karwaan producer Priti Rathi Gupta says ailing actor Irrfan Khan, despite his condition, is quite actively promoting the film on social media and that his loyal fans are waiting for the movie to be released.
Irrfan, who is undergoing treatment in London for a neuroendocrine tumour, is unable to be physically present to participate in the promotion of the film.
Irrfan is very much actively supporting and promoting the film. I know he is going through a journey and we are missing him around, we are missing his physical presence. But in the digital era, we all can be involved in things on social media. That is exactly what he is doing by promoting the film on social media. So I do not think his absence from the promotional activity will affect the film in any way, Gupta told IANS.
Irrfan is not only a known name in the Bollywood world but also in the international film circuit for having worked in films like The Namesake, A Mighty Heart, Slumdog Millionaire, The Amazing Spider-Man and Life of Pi.
I know for a fact that he has his loyal fans across the world and everyone is looking forward to watching the film. We were more than glad to know that he agreed to do the film in the beginning. He has done a fantastic job as always, Gupta added.
The producer, who also backed the film Waiting with her banner Ishka Films alongside Drishyam Films, said she nurtured the idea of making Karwaan for a long time because the story is so fabulous.I loved the story and decided to give it a life. After dealing with a few obstacles, production houses started pursuing the script and Ronnie Screwvalas production house RSVP was among them. I always wanted to partner with him because he is an institution by himself and being a newcomer, I wanted a learning experience from him, she said. IANS

Lipa is recording new James Bond theme
Years & Years bassist Mikey Goldsworthy has let slip that Dua Lipa is recording the next James Bond theme song.
Mikey and bandmates Olly Alexander and Emre Turkmen appeared on BBC Radio 5 Live to chat about the recent release of their short film Palo Santo, which coincided with their new album of the same name, a 15-minute visual that features Judi Dench and Ben Whishaw who play M and Q, respectively, in the spy franchise.Talk soon turned to the next 007 movie, Bond 25, and when asked who would be following in the footsteps of the likes of Adele and Sam Smith, Mikey said the New Rules hitmaker is performing the theme song this time. "Because we had Judi Dench who was M, and Ben Whishaw who was Q, we thought it would be us. I thought they'd ask us to do the theme tune but I think Dua Lipa is doing it," he shared.
However, the If You're Over Me musician soon realised that the bombshell may have been misjudged.
"Am I not supposed to say that" Mikey asked, before Olly joked: "Do you have intel we don't"
"I dunno. I feel bad now," Mikey replied. I've ruined everything. Well, hopefully, and then we'll do it."
Bond 25 will see Daniel Craig reprise his role as the iconic British secret agent while Danny Boyle will be directing and co-writing the script with long-time collaborator John Hodge.
In a May interview with Billboard, Dua admitted that while she hadn't been asked to record the coveted track, she would be happy to accept the job.
"I would love to do it, but Im not recording itso far I dont want to jinx it," the 22-year-old smiled. "I would love to do it."Madonna, Nancy Sinatra and Shirley Bassey are among the stars who have also recorded James Bond themes in the past. Rolling Stone

Longest blood moon eclipse on July 27
The longest total lunar eclipse of the 21st century will be visible to people in Sri Lanka on July 27 (Poya Day), Colombo University Physics Department Prof. Chandana Jayaratne said.
A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes completely through the Earths dark shadow. He said the moon will gradually get darker and then take on a rusty or blood red colour during this type of eclipse. The eclipse will be visible throughout most of Europe, Africa, western and central Asia, the Indian Ocean, and Western Australia.
This will be the first central lunar eclipse since June 15, 2011. The total phase of the blood moon eclipse of July 27 will last 1 hour and 43 minutes. From start to finish, the entire celestial event will last nearly 4 hours.
This times lunar eclipse occurs on the same day the planet Mars reaches its opposition, when it will shine at its best in the night sky.
The red planet will be at its closest approach to Earth and its face will be fully illuminated by the Sun.
It will be brighter than any other time of the year and will be visible all night long. This is the best time to view and photograph Mars. A medium-sized telescope will allow you to see some of the dark details on the planets orange surface, said Sri Lanka Planetarium in its official website.
It is also expected to be the longest blood moon witnessed in 100 years. The moon will be visible in a scarlet red hue for over 1 hour and 43 minutes, which is 40 per cent longer than any other blood moon measured in recent times. A total lunar eclipse is sometimes called a Blood Moon, because of the reddish colour the Full Moon takes on when fully eclipsed. As the Suns rays pass through the earths atmosphere, some colors in the light spectrum are filtered out due to scattering. Red wavelengths are least affected by this effect, so the light reaching the moons surface has a reddish hue, causing the fully eclipsed moon to take on a red color.
If we talk about the world, the areas that are at a prime position to see this eclipse in its full glory are eastern Africa, central Asia and the Middle East. Sri Lankan will not have the opportunity see another total lunar eclipse from beginning to the end again till 2025 and school children in particular shall organize night sky astronomical observation camps using this rare celestial event.

Mickey Mouse Club reunion
Britney Spears would "definitely" go to a reunion of The Mickey Mouse Club.
The Toxic singer got her first big break in the 1990s revival of The Mickey Mouse Club at the age of 11, alongside fellow budding stars Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, Ryan Gosling, and Keri Russell.
She has since become a global superstar, but Britney isn't afraid to go back to her roots.
"It was a really good time," Britney gushed to Entertainment Tonight. "It was a great time. It was probably one of the most special times in my life, The Mickey Mouse Club."
And the Womanizer songstress would also love to reunite with the original cast, provided they organised it, adding, "They would have to plan it. I would definitely show up. I would go, definitely."
Following the demise of the popular NBC variety show, Britney released her debut studio album ...Baby One More Time in 1999, which went on to sell more than 25 million copies worldwide and become the biggest-selling album ever by a teenage artist.
Though the hit album is approaching its 20th anniversary, the 36-year-old admits it all still feels like yesterday.
"It doesn't (feel like much time has passed). It's been so fast. I feel like I just started yesterday," she recalled. "It's like everything still feels very new, which I guess is a blessing. But it's been a rollercoaster. I've had my manager (Larry Rudolph) for 17 years."
The mum-of-two is currently enjoying the North American leg of her Britney Spears: Piece of Me Tour, as well as juggling the launch of her brand-new unisex fragrance Prerogative and being a mum to sons Sean, 12, and Jayden, 11.
Reflecting on her career, the star admitted she has learned some life lessons on the way and would impart them to her younger self if she could.
"I would tell that Britney just to believe in yourself, and never doubt yourself," she smiled. "Be strong, and be you."

Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation
Monstrous milestone
TripAdvisor once offered a tip for budget travellers: fly on rickety old planes for less. If you have come across that tip and given it a thought, go watch Hotel Transylvania 3 first. It will transport you to the horrors of flying on rickety old planes. The monster-driven aircraft goes into many spasms before finally reaching its destination. The destination is marked by the ships piled on top of each other. Before that takes you to the good old days of Titanic movie, you feel ripped apart within as you hear the lines: Welcome to the Bermuda Triangle.
That itself is the paradox. How can someone be welcome to somewhere that sounds terrific But thats the gist of this movie, Hotel Transylvania 3, directed by Genndy Tartakovsky.
Before the opening credits, the movie introduces us to two lead figures: Dracula and a human who calls himself Professor Van Helsing. Following a series of Jack-and-Jill fashioned encounter between Van Helsing and Dracula, the vampire wraps up the deal. But Van Helsing vows to avenge. Van Helsing shares many similarities with Professor Moriarty of the Sherlock Holmes saga. Like Helsing, Moriarty was a fictitious character produced to create a rift between Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson. He is the criminal mastermind whom Holmes describes as the Napoleon of crime. The writers, Michael McCullers and Genndy Tartakovsky, must probably have been largely inspired by Sir Arthurs darling mischief-maker, Professor Moriarty.
Hotel Transylvania 3 is, of course, a silly animated movie that offers you a great deal of fun. That said, the production has a few interesting themes running underneath. First, it stirs up our memory of the Hitlerist fascism that wished to see a world purged of Jews. Second, the battle between the monsters and humans can relate to many oriental as well as occidental aspects. The orientalism, in fact, is brimming with such bi-partisan battles. Suras and asuras, manussas and amanussas can count in as a few examples in orientalism whereas the battle between good and evil is an ever-present phenomenon in the occidental lore.
Tartakovskys attempt is to erect a new platform to the already-prevailing themes. He poses the question of good and bad. How can we define the good and the bad Who are we to define the good and the bad (and forget about the ugly) The good is not superior and the bad is not inferior. Hotel Transylvania 3 is Tartakovskys attempt to celebrate monsterism or place it on part with humanity.
Van Helsing in a Hitleric wavelength is giving a chase to the monsters. But then at the end, his own life was saved by a monster itself. When he questions why he was saved, the monster (Dracula) responds the obvious: Because we are the same! Dracula voices similar concerns in the opening scene by saying that hate should not be entertained to which Van Helsing turns a deaf ear. He never forgets his revenge and continues the scheming with his great-granddaughter. Following the opening credits, Van Helsing becomes a distant memory until we are halfway through. On that note, we see how Dracula makes every step to save Ericka without knowing she is the daughter of his eternal enemy. This humanity of the monster finally leads Erica to change her attitude towards the monsters. Though she admits, at first, that the monsters are disgusting to her great-grandfather, she later changes that attitude with teary eyes.
It rips apart our thinking which seems to stagnate on a conservative plane. It leads us to believe that we need to crack down our own attitudes towards monsters. Who are the monsters We need to crack down all the monsters in the fairytales. Perhaps the future of humanity might change on this wheel. That change will be the antidote to the current chaos. The so-called die-hard Hitler followers will be forced to abandon their fascist attitudes because of its obvious catastrophic murderousness. In terms of Hotel Transylvania, it is the cluster of monsters that are equipped with over-powerfulness in contrast to the intellectual prowess of the humans.
We live in a maybe monstrous world that its hard to imagine a phenomenon without monsters. We have to employ the monstrous tone to make our voice count  it is part of who we are in the global population, especially in Sri Lanka. Hotel Transylvania 3 weaponises that part of the human condition.
Throughout the production, the monsters seem to share all the human features: a fondness for entertainment, being emotional and looking for soft companions. Ultimately it is the socialization that steps to the fore. Monsters are supposed to be anti-social. But inside Hotel Transylvania all the monsters ache for socialization. Only Count Dracula is without a partner. Even his daughter has a partner, a human.
Dracula, though a monster, teaches us the core values of family. He places family over and above everything else. He applies the element in love as well. The crux of the plot unfolds with the relationship between Dracula and Erica the captain of the ship who is also the great-granddaughter of Van Helsing. At first, Erica feigns her romantic feelings for Dracula as she wants to implement her great-grandfathers scheme. At a certain point, she admits that a relationship between a human and a monster is unthinkable.
Interestingly, and incidentally, Dracula takes us to Edwin Markhams famous lines from Outwitted:
He drew a circle that shut me out-
Heretic, rebel, a thing to flout.
But love and I had the wit to win:
We drew a circle and took him In!
Both Van Helsing and his great-granddaughter detested Dracula because he is a monster. For them, Dracula was a heretic, rebel and a thing to flout. But Dracula and his love had the wit to win. He drew his own circle and took both great-granddaughter and great-grandfather in.
It was Erica who entered his circle first. Her feigned love turned out to be a feigned attempt to revenge. But she could not go on with either. She gave in. Finally, she was the one to save the life of Dracula who had almost given up hopes in the death throes.
Van Helsings attempt to crush Dracula with the mystic music that awakens the death giant is another core element. Each time, Draculas party had to outscore Van Helsing with a positive note of music to lull the death giant into a softer move. Even the most horrible creatures can be calmed down with the aesthetic sense.
Funny enough, the contest between the Van Helsing and Draculas party reaches the bottom line with the Macarena. Van Helsing himself begins to dance to the tune of that song.
When it comes to fun, yes, Hotel Transylvania 3 is absolutely a thumbs-up experience. When it comes to themes, the production deserves a heavier yes as we leave the theatre with much to meditate on.

NDB poised for exceptional growth - Group CEO
NDBs Group Chief Executive Officer  Dimantha Seneviratne, speaks on the backdrop of recent success recorded by National Development Bank PLC in many fronts.

Q1  NDBs inception dates back to 1979. How has the Bank evolved to become a prestigious institution in the Sri Lankan banking industry as it is today 
NDB commenced its operations as a premier development financing institution [DFI] in 1979, nearly four decades ago. This was a time that Sri Lanka was going through a rapid transformation and a new scale of economic development. NDB was instrumental in financially empowering a large number of mega development projects in the county and also funded a host of SMEs in varied sectors, a key segment in the countrys economic development. Over the years it has evolved and broadened its operations to serve a larger customer base of the country. The key turnaround point in the Banks recent history is becoming a fully-fledged commercial bank in 2005. Through the years, NDB has also expanded its services to the capital market activities, through the robust capital market subsidiaries, including private equity management.
We are firmly based on a set of very strong corporate values, which are upheld by our employees such as integrity, excellence in our service, sincerity, accountability and creativity and which are also closely associated with our brand. As an institution which is a custodian of public funds, we conduct ourselves with the highest level of ethical standards, professionalism and are fully compliant with the regulations that govern us. I think a combination of all this and the strong drive for business excellence has put us up in this position.

Q2  NDB made several headlines right through 2018, for various awards and accolades that it won. In which areas have the Bank excelled to receive such a large number of awards
We are highly motivated by the external endorsements that were bestowed upon us during the year. Being recognized as the Best Bank in Sri Lanka by the prestigious, USA based Global Finance publication tops them all. In addition to this, a number of regional as well as UK based awards have recognized NDB in a host of core business performance areas, such as retail banking, SME banking, project financing, financial inclusion endeavors, competence in syndicated loans, corporate debt deals and corporate customer solutions. Two of our retail banking products, Dream Maker personal loans and NDB Good Life credit card were also recognized as the best in their respective categories.
NDBs Group Chief Executive Officer, Dimantha Seneviratne
Our marketing initiatives and investor relations initiatives have also been recognized with awards presented by awarding bodies dedicated to these disciplines.
NDBs capital market cluster companies were also the proud recipient of many awards including NDB Investment Bank being recognized as Sri Lankas Best Investment Bank by the Euromoney Magazine for the seventh consecutive year.
In consideration of the fact that NDB is the only financial services group of its kind in Sri Lanka, and also the excellence NDB has shown in both banking operations as well as capital market solutions, we were also recognized as the Best Financial Group in Sri Lanka, by the Global Banking & Finance Review of UK.
These awards are an affirmation of our commitment for excellence in brining better solutions to our customers and empowering them and also our nation in development.

Q3  What is NDBs current market position
Today, NDB is a fully fledged commercial bank in Sri Lanka. It caters to the retail mass market as well as the retail high-net worth clients, with a robust product portfolio in both assets and liabilities.
Although NDB ceased to become a development bank as per definition, our mission in supporting and empowering the countrys development continues. We cater to corporate, middle market, SME as well as micro scale businesses. We are also a most sought after lender in the project financing sphere, given our expertise in this area.
Apart from that, our positioning in the industry goes beyond the scope of a commercial banking entity. NDB Group is the only financial services group in the country, who offers services in a host of capital market activities such as full service investment banking, securities trading and advisory, wealth management and private equity placements, in addition to commercial banking services. So all in all, we are unique one-stop financial solutions provider, may it be in banking or capital market services, bringing ultimate convenience to our customers.

Q4 - How has NDB Banks performance been in the recent past How well have you performed in 2018 so far 
NDB has made great strides in its performance over the years. We have made considerable improvement in our profitability and balance sheet indicators, especially considering the fact that we have been functioning as a commercial banking entity for just over 10 years, compared to our much mature peer banks.
At a Group level, we have a balance sheet in excess of LKR 400 bn. Over the past five years, the Banks total assets have grown at a CAGR of 18%, whilst loans to customers also have grown at a similar rate. Customer deposits have grown in excess of 20% over the five years. We are glad to have sustained such consistent growth over the past. Weve also increased our profitability levels over the years. As per our financial results for the FY 2017, we are a LKR 4 bn post tax profit banking institution.
Furthermore, we have been maintaining a host of KPIs at very healthy levels. Our non-performing loan ratio, which was 2.46% as per the latest published financial information for the first quarter ended 31 March 2018, has been consistently lower than the industry average. Our cost to income ratio has also been well managed.
Stemming from the fact that our organization was a DFI, there have been few structural mismatches in our model compared to our mature peers. Lower Current Account and Savings Account [CASA] base and high loans to deposits ratio are a few to name. However, we are pleased to note that NDB has made vast improvements in these ratios, in a short span of 12 plus years and come to level playing fields with its peers, and is improving day by day.
During the 2017 financial year, we recorded exceptional growth rates, many of which were well ahead of the industry. Out total assets grew by 15% to reach LKR 383 billion. Our loan book grew by an impressive 20%, ahead of the industry growth rate of 16%. This growth translated to a quantum of LKR 46 bn in loans. Customer deposits grew exponentially, at 34% YoY versus the industry growth rate of 17.5%. This growth translated to a quantum growth of LKR 70 bn. This was the highest YoY deposits growth rate we achieved over the past five years. Within overall deposits the CASA base also grew by an impressive 25%, higher than the industry CASA growth.
In terms of profitability, our profit after tax [PAT] at the bank level soared by 37% to LKR 4.4 bn. Cost to income ratio was 45.5%, an improvement from prior years 49%.
In terms of our performance for 2018 so far, we have continued the upbeat in our performance. As was reflected in our financial results for Q1 2018, we had an exceptional opening quarter for 2018. PAT at the Bank level grew by an impressive 35% to LKR 1.6 bn, compared to Q1 of 2017. Group PAS followed a similar trend, and grew by an encouraging 56% to LKR 1.2 bn.
The indications given by the Q1 results are promising, for yet another successful year in 2018.

Q5  What specific market competencies does the NDB Group enjoy in the Sri Lankas banking and capital markets sphere 
Our retail banking offerings in both assets and liabilities are truly lifestyle solutions. Our full spectrum of products and services cater to the financial needs of any individual, in whichever stage of life they may be in. During 2017, we further strengthened our deposits offering with three new products, namely NDB Savings Planner, NDB Araliya and NDB Achara. Savings Planner is dedicated to smart savers with preference for savings plans, whilst the other two are dedicated to aspiring women and senior citizens in the country. We also relaunched our childrens savings account, with a host of new benefits. NDB Dream Maker is the most sought after personal loan product in the industry. We also have speedy and smart solutions in leasing, housing, credit cards, etc.
We also enjoy unmatched competence in SME financing, which has been a part of our mandate at the inception of the Bank way back in 1979. Since then to date, we have perfected our assistance to this sector, not only via financial assistance, but also via a host of non-financial assistance.
NDBs corporate banking solutions are renowned in the industry for the timely and customer-friendly solutions. Corporate banking is a prime contributor in the Banks loan growth with a full spectrum of service including cash management.
Project financing is yet another very strong competence of NDB. We are proud to have been with some of the major development projects of the country right through our operations spanning four decades. Even today, we are a stakeholder in the major infrastructural and other development projects that are unfolding in Colombo as well as in other parts of the country.
We also enjoy specific competence on the renewable energy sector in the country. We are proud to be one of the banks to fund the first ever wind power projects and waste-to-energy projects in Sri Lanka. Our Project & Infrastructure Unit has also expanded its services to cross-border jurisdictions and pioneered funding renewable energy projects in the African continent, through offshore companies with Sri Lankan origin.
The newest addition to our product portfolio is NDB Business Banking. This is a dedicated proposition to empower the businesses in the SME and middle market segments with the mission to assist them in taking their businesses to the next level of growth.
The capital market subsidiaries of NDB have also firmly established themselves in the industry. Our investment banking arm, NDBIB is the market leader for debt and equity capital raising and mergers and acquisitions. Our wealth management arm, NDB Wealth Management is Sri Lankas largest private fund manager with close LKR 100 bn funds under management with 8,000 plus customers.

Q6  Please tell us about your presence in the country.
Our reach to customers has also increased significantly. NDBs network which stood at 22 branches when we converted to a commercial banking entity in 2005 has now reached 107, spread across the country with fully-fledged branches. A notable point about our network is that approximately 50% of the branches have been added on to the network over the past five years, hence with considerable potential in reaching out to more clients. Our reach is also strengthened by an on and off site network of 129 ATMs and cash recycle machines.
Our virtual presence is also quite strong, presented via a host of digitally enabled platforms. On-line banking, mobile banking enabled on both smart phones and feature phones, branchless banking and cash recycle machines are few to name. We have strengthened our dedicated Digital Financial Services [DFS] Unit by hiring skilled and experienced staff, to enhance and improve our digital solutions, and stay abreast with the latest technology available in our industry.
We have our presence in the South Asian region as well, in Bangladesh, with an investment banking arm under the name, NDB Capital Limited Bangladesh. This entity has greater growth prospects in the backdrop of high economic growth recorded in Bangladesh.

Q7  What is the Banks current strategy that has propelled the Bank forward 
We are presently on a very ambitious organic growth strategy. Dubbed as Transformation 2020, this strategy aims to transform NDB to a systemically important bank in the country by 2020, with a total assets base exceeding LKR 500 billion, as defined by the Basel III guidelines. The strategy was developed with the professional input of the IFC, a part of the World Bank Group. It involves improvements in a large range of business processes as well as support services within the Bank, with a bid to increase business volumes, profitability and customer services.
This transformational strategic process can be described as the most structured and coordinated strategy program in the Bank. The strategy has led to a new organizational culture and transformation in the mindset of Team NDB, aligning them towards the strategy, and ensuring their understanding and acceptance of the ambitious growth journey the bank has embarked on.

Q8 - Does the bank have any inorganic growth plans or Could you outline your companys/groups future plans especially in regard to expansion
Whilst we move forward on organic growth, we most certainly are open for inorganic growth opportunities as well. Consolidation can bring in a host of benefits to the industry also. Given the implications of recent developments affecting the banking sector such as Basel III guidelines, implementation of IFRS 9 and new tax laws in operation, banks and financial institutions are facing large capital requirements. Consolidation could prove as an effective solution in enabling certain entities to be compliant in these capital requirements.
We would look at inorganic growth options, provided such consolidation enhances the value to the shareholders and other stakeholders and complements our growth model.

Q9  What is NDBs approach to capital management and infusion of new capital to support the growth of the business
As a financial services institution, capital is of utmost important to us. As we have now entered a rapid growth mode, we are required to maintain a healthy capital level to support this growth. Historically, and to date, NDB has been soundly capitalized, with our capital ratios well above the regulator mandated levels.
In times of need, we have resorted to raising capital via feasible modes, such as debenture issuances, as seen in 2013 and 2015. Recently, we also made intimations of raising equity capital to support the Banks growth. Accordingly, we have now announced our plans to raise equity capital via a Rights Issue of LKR 6.2 bn.
Furthermore, we fund the balance sheet and loan book growth via timely institutional funding. In June 2018, the Bank obtained a loan of up to USD 75 million from Commerzbank Aktikengsellschaft Germany. The funds will be mobilized in NDBs general banking business, without restrictions on any specific sector.
The Bank also entered in to an agreement with the IFC, for a loan up to USD 50 million, equivalent to a fixed rupee facility of LKR 8 bn, for the purpose of lending to borrowers, especially in the climate smart agriculture sector.

Q10  What are the challenges that your bank face, as a relatively young commercial bank
As I mentioned earlier, our commercial banking operations have been in operation for just over thirteen years. Attracting low cost funds, especially CASA remains one of the key challenges that we face. We have made vast improvements in this regard, having improved the CASA base from almost zero to mid-20% in just 10 years. Our strategy places key emphasis in improving the CASA base. What is noteworthy is that, in the challenge in improving CASA, also comes the upside of further enhancing our interest margins and profitability.
The scale of balance sheet, compared to much mature peers is also one area we are working on. The current strategy pursued by the Bank will propel us to be amongst the systemically important banks and place us on a better footing in terms of capturing scale advantages from 2020 onwards.

Q11  How strong is your core management team, and the Group management team, in steering your organization through this internal growth phase, amidst external challenges
We have one of the best corporate management teams, with members who are industry savvy, and carry to their credit, the right fusion of professional qualifications and years of experience. They are competent in motivating our staff and guiding them towards delivering results. During the recent past, the organization saw some structural changes, to recalibrate its business model to cater to developing industry trends. We had the incoming of some fresh seasoned hands in to the Bank, to bring in added versatility to the corporate management team.
For example we saw new appointees in the positions of the Group Chief Financial Officer, Vice President Human Resources and Vice President IT. We also strengthened our corporate management team with a new Vice President position for Business Banking, which is now a key business segment within the Banks overall business focus. This position was occupied by one of our own in grown talents, who is an expert in SME financing. A head of digital financial services was also appointed at the Assistant Vice President level, considering the significance of digital aspects in todays banking and its contribution in our surge forward.
The function of Marketing was broadened to Marketing & Customer Experience, now under the leadership of a Vice President, in recognition of the importance of our customercentric growth model.
We will also be on-boarding a Chief Operating Officer very soon, another seasoned hand in the industry, to overlook all the operational aspects which is the backbone of the Bank, such that we could focus on business development.
I think with these changes in the corporate management team, the transition of which has happened in a gratifyingly short period, we are ready to take NDB to the next level.
Apart from these changes to the top management team, we carried out a host of organizational change management initiatives encompassing the total NDB Team. These initiatives ensured that all of the NDB members are aware and aligned towards the Banks overall strategic objectives as set out in the Transformation 2020 strategy, and are further united under the Banks new culture identity One NDB in achieving them.
Similar change management and synergy development initiatives are presently underway at the NDB Group companies, in the capital markets cluster; such that we can harness all financial services under one umbrella to provide a seamless and full spectrum of services to our customers.

Q12  What are the growth prospects for NDB for beyond 2020 How will NDB achieve them 
We have already strategized our growth trajectory to be pursued for the next five years, once we complete our mission set out by the current strategy of Transformation 2020. We will focus on taking NDB to greater heights, from the LKR 500 bn plus, systemically important institution that it will be by 2020. We will well embed the wider technological and customer demographic changes in to our strategy as they unfold, to stay relevant and competitive in the fast evolving market space.
Delivering on digitally enable banking solutions will be at the core of our strategy and growth mode. Digital financial services [DFS] are undergoing rapid development, and some of our regional peers are now using Artificial Intelligence to serve their customers. DFS offers limitless possibilities. The upside for a mid-sized bank like NDB is that our scale of operations better allows us to embrace and embed these DFS initiatives towards an optimum business model, as opposed to larger institutions, where such conversions would be more challenging and time-consuming.
The unwavering strength of our shareholders has been a key constituent of our success over the years. We look forward to their continued support as NDB forges ahead in the industry and enters new leagues. NDB is blessed with a team of best in class, skilled, trained and qualified employees, who have made every success of the Bank possible. Our loyal customer base is our biggest strength and our commitment is for their success and prosperity.
Our gratitude goes out to all stakeholders who support us in our growth journey.

New Development Bank to offer Rs 10 bn for startups, SMEs - PM
The government will start a new Development Bank and in its first round of financing, it will give Rs 10 billion in loans to Sri Lankan entrepreneurs, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe speaking at the Northern Entrepreneur Awards 2017 organised by National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA) in association with Yalpanam Chamber of Commerce, in Jaffna.
Capital for development will also be given. Northern entrepreneurs will get larger tax reliefs. Tax relief for Capital expenditure is 200% at present but it will be increased to 300%. If your new industry is an industry targeting exports, then the tax is only 14% , he said.
The Premier said that Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen is in negotiations for a new industrial zone for the North. Fishery can also be developed for exports while tourism too can be developed including yachting services for islands he said.
The Prime Minister also said that the government is negotiating with India for a major development project for the Northern Province in the scale of the historic Mahaweli project.
We are in talks with India for Northern development, in the next 10 years. There was a strong base of entrepreneurship during pre-war times in the North, which the prolonged war destroyed. Some Northern entrepreneurs switched to Colombo while others migrated. Now we should rebuild the economy and speed up growth here, brining north in par with the rest.
We need to reinstate yester-years Northern glory. Enterprise Sri Lanka is one of the key programs helping Sri Lankan entrepreneurs. We conditionally subsidise entrepreneurs. For some we wont even charge loan interest since start-up process is our priority. This rule is for all scales of entrepreneurs-small, medium and large. The Gamperaliya program also helps SMEs. Village infrastructure development program is also on.
The poverty levels of the Province have declined from 30% in war times to around 10% at present. Therefore this is the correct time for SME revival in this province, said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen.
Sri Lanka has more than one million registered SMEs, each employing three persons on average. Taken together with other micro enterprises and SMEs that are not registered, the sectors presence is weightier with a sizeable contribution to the economy an estimated 52 percent of GDP. According to the Yalpanam Chamber, Northern Province hosts approximately 2000 SMEs.
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Vigneshwaran, Chairman of NEDA D. Bogollagama and Chairman of Yaalpanam Chamber of Commerce K Vignesh also participated.

One for the fans
The world is closing inDid you ever thinkThat we could be so close, like brothersThe future's in the airI can feel it everywhereBlowing with the wind of change
The Scorpions  Wind of Change
Music has the power to change and transform lives. It is our past, present and our future. Scorpions is one band that inspires Sajith Gunaratna. And these lyrics are powerful because it carries a certain message with it and that message is that we are a brotherhood or sisterhood. And music brings us together. And it is possible for there to be change, if we only follow our hearts and believe that change is possible. And if we can believe that we can do anything. Melodies features Sajith Gunaratna of N-Chord.
The bands that inspire me internationally are Toto, Guns and Roses and Scorpions. Obviously in our time we grew up with boy bands like Backstreet Boys and N-sync. From them I got the enthusiasm to sing English Songs, but later on when I listened to Queen it took me to a different level of listening and learning. I personally love Marc Anthony and Lionel Ritchie. But recently I'm in love with Perfect by Ed Sheeran, said Gunaratna.
The beginning of N-Chord started in 2014, when Gunaratnas good friend Sahan Hewadewa at that time the F&B Manager at OZO Colombo invited him to play at 14 rooftop bar. As a result he formed the band N-Chord, first as a trio, and after that as a full band. Gunaratna believes that the best platform that N-chord ever got was being the resident band for Shangri-la Hambanthota. That was a real experience and exposure.
N-Chord is a commercial band. We cover weddings, cocktails and dinner dances. We play all the genres starting from golden hits to the new charts. Also we play some beautiful classic Sinhalese songs for clients satisfaction, said Gunaratna.
When it comes to N-Chord what they believe in is pleasing their fans. Bands owe everything to their fans. Bands are what they are because of their fans. What N-Chord believes in is loyalty to their fans. They do not let their fans down by playing music that is half- hearted. They give their fans their everything. They are honest and enthusiastic about what they do. When they get their hands on an instrument or when they are up there on stage, they just want to make their fans enjoy the evening and leave a lasting impression.
When you talk about music in Sri Lanka, there are different bands playing a different kind of music for a different kind of audience. What N-Chord believes is Quality!! I want to do quality music which is one reason to form my own band. The Crowd loves it, pointed out Gunaratna
If you are passionate about what you do, then no matter who says what, you are going to succeed. Let people talk and say what they want, at the end of the day you are the winner. When you are passionate about what you do and you do it every day, then everything else in your life becomes meaningful. Life starts to make sense. You need to have passion
Well I'm passionate, because this is what I always love doing. God has given me the talent to sing, so then I simply took it to the next level of entertaining the audience. Anyone can sing, but it's very hard to entertain the audience. Therefore I have a passion for music, explained Gunaratna.
Gunaratnas advice for anyone who wants to take up music is to be humble, do what you love, always think about quality and be disciplined. This is what makes him successful. You have the passion but you also need the maturity to handle it and you need self-control. If you dont have that self-control and you dont have that maturity then your tremendous talent will be of no avail. You will burn up. You will crash like a meteorite.
The world is full of music lovers, some love jazz, some love reggae, Some love heavy metal, it's a carnival to be honest. I choose music because that's always what I have loved and it is my passion. Music heals souls, therefore I'm proud and happy, because I'm a part of that. Last but not least I want to thank my parents and my sister for playing a huge part in my life, my beautiful wife Dinu, who brings so much encouragement to my music life and my family life, My mother in law and all my family. I also want to thank my friends Shean, Sahan, Sean and Ashan, who always inspire me. I want to thank my band and I cannot forget my two beautiful daughters Sehali and Leo, for being my Lucky Charms, added Gunaratna.

Perry recharged at retreat after Witness album flop
Katy Perry fell into a deep depression after her Witness album flopped last year.
The pop star tells Vogue Australia the public's reaction to her fifth record, which featured the tracks Swish Swish and Bon Appetit, left her heartbroken - and led to some serious soul searching.
"I have had bouts of situational depression and my heart was broken last year because, unknowingly, I put so much validity in the reaction of the public, and the public didnt react in the way I had expected to," Perry tells the publication. The low prompted Katy to seek help and counselling at the Hoffman Institute in San Rafael, California, where she felt recharged and re-energised.
"Essentially and metaphorically, we are all computers, and sometimes we adopt these viruses via our parents or via the nurture that we are given or not given growing up," she explains. "These toxic tendencies can start to play out in our behaviour, in our adult patterns, in our relationships."
Katy was so impressed with the treatment she received at the Hoffman Institute, she has started handing out gift certificates to friends, urging them to seek help there when they need a breakthrough in life or a mind makeover.
And she admits the biggest breakthrough she had was realising she didn't have to be an emotional wreck to be a successful singer and songwriter.

Pus in the chest may cost you your life
You should not be shocked if you hear your physician telling you that you have an accumulation of pus in and around the lungs. In developing counties, the healthcare delivery system is in such a poor state that thousands of poor and middle class people commonly have pus in the chest. Neither are our citizens aware of this condition nor does the medical fraternity seem to regard the treatment of this condition seriously.
A patient who is suffering from pus inside the chest neither knows where to go nor knows anyone who can advise him correctly. The net result is that on one hand, this medical condition is overlooked, and secondly, the possibility of taking a wrong course of treatment increases considerably, and in the end, it is only the patient who suffers the most and he pays either by losing his lung or by losing his life.
Detection of collection of pus inside the chest
A patient who has pus collection inside the chest suffers from fever all the time, but during the daytime, fever is lower and increases rapidly during the evening or night. Along with the fever, the patient complains of excessive sweating all the time. There is a desire to cough, but on coughing, either nothing or a small amount of phlegm comes out. On coughing, the patient feels pain in the chest, especially on the side where the pus is collected.
If you have suffered from pneumonia one month before or you have previously received a chest injury and you find that even after one month of the infection or the injury, you are still suffering from cough and fever, immediately get the chest x-ray done. Remember that the chest x-ray in such a condition should be done in standing position. On examination of the chest x-ray, if pus collection is suspected or the lung shows whitening on one side, immediately go to an experienced radiologist and get an ultrasound examination of your chest. There are two advantages of doing chest ultrasound examination: firstly, it will confirm the presence of pus or water inside the chest cavity, and secondly, it will quantify the amount of pus collected therein, so that the correct strategy of treatment can be formulated.
Present scenario in developing countries
In a developing country like India, every year about two lakhs of new patients fall victim to this disease. Of these, about 80,000 lose their lives due to lack of adequate treatment and 60 percent of those who survive die later of complications from this disease. Among older patients, 75 percent die. The statistics themselves show how serious we are in India about treatment of this disease, which in medical terms is called empyema thoracis. This also reflects the stage in which the healthcare delivery system is in developing countries and how much importance is given to this medical condition.
What is pus collection inside the chest
There is an empty space between the chest wall and the lung. When we breathe, the lung expands and completely fills up this empty space, which in medical terms is called pleural space. When due to any reason this empty space gets filled up with pus, this condition in medical terms is called empyema thoracics. Empyema thoracis simply means in common mans language, a collection of pus around the lung inside the chest.
Why does pus collect inside the chest
The most important reasons for pus collection inside the chest are pneumonia and tuberculosis (TB) in the lung. A significant amount of pus-like water collects around the lung. If this infection is not controlled effectively, the same accumulated water in the empty space converts completely into pus.
The second reason in developing countries for pus collection inside the chest is tuberculosis in the lung. During the early stage of TB, yellow-coloured water gets collected. If this water gets infected due to an outside infection, it gets converted into pus. In India, due to repeated removal of this collected water through a syringe and needle, this tubercular fluid gets converted into pus. If in a tubercular patient, the amount of collected water inside the chest is more than 500ml and if this water is not removed and is left inside the chest, the possibility of this yellow water getting converted into pus increases considerably.
Therefore, always remember, if there is a tubercular infection in the lung and the amount of collected water around the lung is more than 500ml, immediately consult a thoracic or a chest surgeon and get that collected water removed through a chest tube and continue with anti-tubercular medication.
Chest injury causing pus collection
One other important reason for pus collection inside the chest is an injury to the chest. In a road traffic accident, fracture of the ribs is a common occurrence and this leads to injury of the lung and collection of blood inside the chest. If that collected blood inside the chest is not removed in time, the possibility of infection and accumulated old blood converting into pus increases considerably.
There are other reasons for pus collection inside the chest. For example, perforation of the food pipe due to injury or cancer, infection of the backbone, or development of a condition called BPF (broncho pleural fistula) after lung operation.
Liver abscess too plays a role
In a developing country, one more reason for pus collection inside the chest which is very peculiar and specific to Asian and Arabian contexts, is a liver abscess. In developing countries, due to bad hygiene when eating, people easily fall victim to chronic dysentery and diarrhoea. In a patient after recurrent episodes of dysentery and diarrhoea, infection reaches the liver and cause pus collection inside the liver. If the liver abscess is not treated effectively and in time, the size of the pus cavity increases tremendously and ultimately, it ruptures. If liver abscess bursts upwards into the chest, the pus starts collecting inside the chest. This is a very dangerous condition. If timely intervention under supervision of a thoracic surgeon is not sought, the patient might die.
Consult a thoracic surgeon
If you have come to know about collection of pus inside your chest, immediately consult a thoracic or a chest surgeon. Moving here and there with no proper guidance will result in a waste of time and money and will increase the possibility of destruction of the lung. Sometime this delay in treatment may cost the patient his life.
If pus collection is of recent onset, consult a thoracic surgeon who will administer medication through a tube. These medicines are called streptokinase or urokinase or TPA. When pus stays inside the chest at a same place for three or four days, flimsy partition walls are formed which trap the pus within these partitions. These partitions weave a network around the lung. Because of pus being trapped between the partitions, the entire collected pus does not come out of the chest through the tube. This procedure is called tube thoracostomy or fibrinolvsis.
If tube thoracostomy does not yield a desired result, then the surgeon would make two or three holes inside the chest, or through a telescope, partitions are broken down so that the pus can come out of the chest without any obstruction. If this telescopic method fails, a small cut is made on the chest wall and all partitions are broken, and after this procedure, the lung comes back to its original position and is thus saved from destruction. This method of making a cut and cleaning the chest is almost 100 percent effective and successful.
Mismanagement can leads to more problems
It has been observed that in developing countries when children suffer from pneumonia and pus-like water collects around the lung inside the chest, the child specialist himself tries to take out the pus-like water in small quantities through injection at repeated short intervals. Sometimes, they put a very narrow tube inside the chest to take out the pus, with the result that the pus is never evacuated from the chest completely. Inadequate removal of pus-like water from the chest cavity creates two main problems: firstly, infection is never eradicated, no matter how many strong and effective antibiotics we use, and secondly, there is a likelihood of developing a medical condition called broncho pleural fistula (BPF). This condition will result in either loss of lung or loss of life.
Correct strategy for treatment
Therefore, always remember if your child is suffering from pneumonia or TB and pus has collected around the lung and inside the chest, you should request the child specialist or physician to consult a thoracic surgeon and follow his advice and keep on taking his advice, otherwise the possibility of lung destruction increases significantly.
If pus has collected inside the chest for more than a week, immediately contact a thoracic surgeon. This operation that will be performed is called empyemectomy decortication. This operation is effective in the majority of people. If the pus has collected inside the chest for more than eight days, never get the pus removed through thoracoscope (telescope) for there is possibility of irreparable damage to the lung as well as bleeding.
If one month has passed since the collection of pus, the partition formed inside the pus cavity becomes very hard and constitutes a thick and hard layer around the lung. This results in excessive compression of the trapped lung. This compression disturbs the breathing process and destroys the lung completely. In such a situation, be careful and consult a thoracic surgeon without any further delay and get yourself treated.

Sri Lanka develops low-carb rice - Neeroga
Ambalantota Rice Research Centre has introduced a new variety of low-carb rice - Neeroga - in order to prevent diabetes.
During an inspection tour of the Rice Research Centre in Ambalantota, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera underlined the importance of promoting this rice variety as a commercial crop to meet the increasing demand for low-carb rice in the local as well as the international market.
As a country where the staple food is rice, most Sri Lankans eat rice for all three main meals. Rice is rich in carbohydrates and consuming more rice will store excess sugar in the blood which leads to diabetes.
Considering this, the scientists of the Rice Research Centre in Ambalantota conducted research to produce a low-carb rice variety. As a result of that research, scientists developed this new rice variety, said the minister.
According to the Minister, the Agriculture Department has already taken measures to conduct a large number of research projects with the intention of introducing healthy food crops.

Taste of freedom
Despite coming under constant criticism of the politicians in the North, the Sri Lanka Army continues to render their contribution towards the reconciliation process and wellbeing of the people in Jaffna. They are engaged in providing assistance to the people of the North rebuild their lives, improve their livelihood and even in the education of the younger generation.
With the aim of promoting religious harmony, the army assisted in organising a multi-religious conference with the participation of the religious leaders of all faiths. Further discussions were also initiated with the senior citizens of the North, the Chamber of Commerce (Jaffna) and also the business community on the issues facing the Northern region, with the hope of assisting in addressing these issues.
For the first time in history, a dialog with the Maha Nayaka Thera of the Asgiri Chapter and multi-religious leaders in Jaffna was organised with the mediation of the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters in August last year, in order to discuss their difficulties.
Further, under their community responsibility initiative and with the aim of promoting religious harmony, the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters also initiated a project to renovate 100 Hindu Kovils in the North. This project commenced in 2018 under the guidance of the Jaffna Security Force Commander Maj. Gen. Darshana Hettiarachchi on the instructions of Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake.
The Army had organised the Unduwap Perahera of the Sri Naga Viharaya in December 2017, exhibiting many cultural aspects of Buddhism and Hinduism, which attracted a large crowd. This event included not just the Buddhist cultural troops but a large number of Hindu cultural items were also part of this perahera.
Vesak celebrations
Meanwhile, the Vesak celebration which was organised by the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters though not viewed by some Tamil leaders very favourably has gained popularity among the public of the North. Judging from the crowd turnout, it is no doubt a novel source of entertainment for the Jaffna people. The Vesask Dansela this year, catered to over 15,000 people on each of the days it was held. The Vesak pandols on display also attracted large crowds. According to one of the visitors to the Vesak zone, both the young and old come for the Vesak celebrations as they enjoy seeing the lanterns and pandols and it also gives them an understanding of the Buddhist culture.
Previously, if a person from Jaffna needed to witness the Vesak celebrations, they would have to travel either to Anuradhapura or Colombo, but now with the Vesak celebrations being held in the North, the Northern people too could enjoy this festival, said one of the residents. Sinhalese and Tamils alike joined in the celebrations and enjoyed the entertainment and meals, clearly indicating that the ordinary people, be it Sinhala or Tamil, have no grudges and they want to live in harmony and peace.
Further, a food festival was also organised in Jaffna under the Armys reconciliation promotion drive, including various dishes from every region of the country. This gave the Jaffna residents a chance to taste food from every other region in the country.
In addition, Christmas was also celebrated in grand style in the North under the organising efforts of the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters. The Jaffna Bishop and several other dignitaries participated in the Christmas celebrations.
Upgrading the social status of the people of the North and providing housing for the displaced, the Sri Lanka Army has constructed 133 houses for the internally displaced persons (IDPs) at Keerimalai which was handed over to the recipients on October 31, 2016.
Financial assistance was provided by an army officer, as a goodwill gesture to construct a house for a deserving family in Periyavilan, Jaffna which was completed and handed over to that family on September 26, 2017.
The Army also constructed another 25 houses for the internally displaced persons at Keerimalai and handed them over to the recipients on March 30, 2018.
The Army also provided assistance to construct another 30 houses to resettle the internally displaced persons at the Thelippalai area and these houses were also handed over to the recipients on April 5, 2018.
Further another six houses are currently under construction in the Karainagar area being built by the Army. A house is also being built for a university student, Suriya Kumar and his family by the army.
Housing project
The foundation stone was laid by the Jaffna Commander on May 11, 2018 to initiate a housing project of 30 houses for deserving families in Kytes. These houses are being constructed with the assistance of the Daham Pahana foundation by its founder Brother Charles Thomas.
Assisting the Northern people in their farming activities, the army took the initiative to provide tractors and military personnel to families that needed assistance to plough their lands for agricultural purposes on November 01, 2017.
Assisting the disabled civilians in the North they also initiated several programmes to provide artificial limbs to those who were disabled. The army donated limbs for the disabled at Aiyakachchi on October 17, 2017, and also donated artificial limbs to the disabled persons at a ceremony in Aiyakachchi in collaboration with the Centre for Handicapped  Kundasale on June 6, 2018.
In June 2018, four artificial limbs were donated to disabled persons through the assistance of the Daham Pahana founder Brother Charles Thomas.
Not just limiting their assistance in the day-to-day activities, the army has also initiated programmes to help the environment in the North. With this aim, the army initiated a special project on October 21, 2017, to protect the coastal belt in collaboration with the Coast Conservation Department.
Initiating a coconut plantation project in 2017, the army provided each family five coconut seedlings to be planted on their private lands. In an initiative to plant 100,000 coconut plants in the North, the army planted 10,000 coconut seedlings so far this year in the lands occupied by the army in collaboration with the Coconut Development Board. Their target is to complete the planting of the 100,000 coconut plants by the end of this year.
Further, a Palmyra planting project was also initiated in 2017 and so far 15,000 Palmyra seeds have been planted in the North with the collaboration of the Palmyra Development Board.
A reforestation project was initiated in 2017 in collaboration with the Forest Department and so far 7,000 plants have been planted by the army during last year.
The ex-combatants are a group of people in the North who were most affected both during and after the war. Having put their lives on the line during the war, after the war ended, most of them found that they were not welcome in their own villages and most did not want to employ them.
However, having undergone the rehabilitation programme organised by the government, most of these combatants who knew only the art of combat, learnt other employment skills. Hence, under the livelihood assistance to these ex-combatants, the army had donated 15 sewing machines to female ex-combatants to assist them in self-employment opportunities on March 28, 2018.
In addition, 7,500 coconut seedlings were also donated to low income families by the DahamPahana foundation, where each family was provided with five coconut seedlings each.
The Daham Pahana foundation also donated sewing materials to 20 low income families to the value of Rs. 20,000 each for every family to assist them in improving their earning capacity.
Speaking to the Daily News, the Security Force Headquarters Jaffna Commander Maj. Gen. Darshana Hettiarachchi said his aim was to promote the educational standards of the children of the North so that they would not resort to violent activities in future. These people have undergone tremendous hardships during the 30 years of war. Most of these children know nothing but violence and bloodshed. This must stop and the only way to stop this culture of violence and hatred is to educate the younger generation so that they would be more knowledgeable and no one will be able to brainwash them. In the past Jaffna was considered an educated and knowledgeable society. They were hardworking and excelled in their studies. My aim is to once again, promote these youngsters to focus on their education and be part of building a strong and educated Sri Lanka.
Focus on education
With this intention, an appreciation ceremony was organised on December 7, 2017 to felicitate the students who excelled at the Year 5 Scholarship Examination and obtained the all island 1st and 2nd places in the Tamil medium. An appreciation of 204 students who had obtained 9 A passes at the GCE O/L examination in 2016 was also held. They were presented with books, stationary school bags and branded wrist watches at a ceremony held on July 29, 2017 in order to encourage them to pursue higher educational goals.
Scholarships were also awarded to three students from Jaffna on March 2, 2018 who achieved island wide ranks at the GCE A/L examination in 2017. They were awarded a scholarship of Rs 5,000 monthly and a laptop computer to assist them further in their studies.
In addition, in their drive to improve the facilities of the schools in the region, the Ottapulam RCTM School which was within the army controlled area was released on November 30, 2017. Further, a childrens park was constructed at the Kopay Maha Vidyalaya which was handed over to the school early last year.
A drinking water project was also initiated at the Nawatkuli Vidyalaya in July last year.
Sanitary facilities for students of Drieberg College in Chavakachcheri was also facilitated by the army in August last year. They also donated books, stationary and bicycles to the students of the Punguduthivu Maha Vidyalaya in November last year.
In addition, books and stationary were distributed among the students of Madihe Pannaseeha Vidyalaya in Puttur under the patronage of the Maha Nayaka Thera of the Asgiri Chapter last year, while, school bags and stationary was donated to the students of seven schools in Jaffna district on January 26 and 27, 2018.
The army also renovated the playground of Hartley College, Point Pedro in April 2018.
The distribution of 100 bicycles to deserving students was held on May 10, 2018 which was organised by Brother Charles Thomas of the Daham Pahana foundation. The people of the South are prepared to assist their brothers and sisters in the North who are finding it hard to get back on their feet, said Brother Charles Thomas.
The Daham Pahana foundation has facilitated many projects to donate school items and bicycles in collaboration with the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters. Under this initiative, 300 scholarships were awarded to deserving students on May 10, 2018, and again in June this year, another 100 bicycles was donated.
Further, the Palmyra Ingenuity  2017 innovative exhibition was organised by the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters in collaboration with the Ministry of Technology and Research in May last year.
With the objective of Transforming Creative Imagination into Innovation, among the troops of the SFHQ-J the Palmyrah Ingenuity was staged in order to tap inherent innovative talents of hundreds of troops serving the Jaffna peninsula.
A large gathering of students and civilians in the peninsula attended the exhibition held at the Weerasingham Hall on both days at the invitation of authorities at the Department of Education in Jaffna.
Under its latest project for the Northern people, the army conducted an Eye Clinic for civilians in the Jaffna Peninsula on June 10, 2018 and 159 civilians were diagnosed as cataract patients. Cataract surgeries for 20 civilians were carried out under the phase 1 of the programme at the Lions Golden Jubilee Eye Hospital in Colombo on July 5, 2018. The Security Force Jaffna provided all transportation and lodging facilities for these patients during their stay in Colombo as a goodwill gesture.

These parents have named their child Abcde
We all know celebs have a field day when it comes to naming their children. But if we mere mortals wanted to name our kids Apple or Bear, wed have to think about the kind of taunts theyd get in the playground.
Posting on online forum Netmums, user Annalise revealed that one of her friends friend paid no mind to all that business as she named her child Abcde.
Strangest baby name ever she asked. I was talking to my friend whose friend just had a baby. The babys name is Abcde, and pronounced: Ab-si-dee. Ive never heard of this name before  has anyone else she posed to the users of the site.
Of course, no one else heard of the name either and some didnt hold back from their feelings.
One went as far as to say it should be against the law to do that to a child.
It should be illegal to saddle children with names like that. Awful, she wrote.
That is the silliest name Ive ever heard  but kudos for the imaginative pronunciation. Some parents are too cruel, wrote another.
Others joined in with tales of other unconventional names theyd heard, though some may have just been trolling.
Erin joked, Its great because if they have another child, they can call it Fghij then the next Klmno and so forth.
Ive heard of an A-Apronounced A-dash-a, joked Megan.
One user, Jade, commented on her mother-in-laws choice of names, OMG. My mother-in-law named one daughter Essence-Star and the other Maikayda-Bliss.
Finding the whole thing entertaining, Annalise went on to do some research and found that the name Abcde is more popular than one might think.
In fact, 328 girls were named Abcde in the United States between 1990 and 2014, she revealed.
According to Wikipedia, it is a rare Latin feminine name, with origins in Hawaii and is popular among Hispanic families in New Mexico.

Three persons die every day in SL of oral cancers
Three persons die every day in Sri Lanka of oral cancers. In 2011, a total of seven new oral cancer cases were reported and this number increased to eight by 2014, Consultant in Community Dentistry of the National Cancer Control Programme, Dr. Prasanna Jayasekara said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said that oral cancer tops all the other cancers in the country and more men get oral cancers than women. Oral cancers showed an alarming increase among Sri Lankan males between 2006 and 2011.
According to Dr. Jayasekara, around 72 percent of oral cancer patients seek medical treatment when the cancer reaches stage 3 or 4, which is very late. Every day around six new oral cancer patients are detected. The five-year survival rate is less than 50 percent. There are 28 carcinogens in tobacco, while there are four in areca nut.
Prof. Ruwan D. Jayasinghe said that it is arecanut and tobacco and their products which cause oral cancers. Arecanut and tobacco-based products arrive in Sri Lanka from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, etc, and even the importation of such products is banned. Chewing betel and chewing arecanut and tobacco products have been banned inside all health institutions since 2017 and this ban will be extended to all state institutions and schools soon. It is sad to see the number of schoolchildren addicted to these products increasing daily, he said.

TORONTO SHOOTING: TWO INCLUDING GUNMAN DEAD
CANADA: Two people including the gunman are dead and 13 wounded in Toronto after a shooting Sunday in the busy Greektown neighbourhood, adding to concern about gun violence in Canadas largest city.
One female adult has died. One young girl in critical condition, Toronto police said on Twitter, adding that all 14 victims were shot with a handgun.
Police said the suspect was also dead, and The Toronto Star quoted Police Chief Mark Saunders as saying there had been an exchange of gunfire. The suspect is believed to have opened fire at police before killing himself, Global News quoted a Toronto police source as saying.
Officers, some armed with rifles, sealed off Greektowns main street, known as the Danforth, after getting the call early on Monday.
Witnesses described to local media hearing about 20 shots and the sound of a weapon being reloaded several times. Jody Steinhauer told CBC News she was at a neighborhood restaurant with her family when she heard what sounded like 10 to 15 blasts of firecrackers. She said she was told to run to the back of the restaurant. We started to hear people scream out front, Steinhauer told the broadcaster.
Ontarios new Premier Doug Ford tweeted a message of solidarity, saying: My heart goes out to the victims and loved ones of the horrific act of gun violence in Toronto. The incident comes with Canadas largest metropolis concerned over a surge of shootings, more than 200, this year. About two dozen have been fatal.
Canada traditionally has relatively low levels of gun violence, particularly compared with its neighbor the United States.
Mayor John Tory said Sunday nights firearms violence is evidence of a gun problem in Toronto.
Guns are too readily available to too many people, Tory told a news conference two hours after the shooting took place. He added that details of the latest incident remained sketchy.
We have to figure out what happened here. We dont know, he said.
Last week, Toronto police started implementing the enforcement component of their gun violence reduction plan. That includes around 200 additional officers on shift in particular neighborhoods between the hours of 7:00 pm and 3:00 am - when most shootings occur.
The Greektown shooting comes about three months after the city was shaken by the deaths of 10 people, most of them women, killed by a man with an apparent grudge against women who drove into them on a busy street in Torontos north end.

On traitors and patriots
Last week was one of hope and despair. Hope because a group of academics came out boldly in defence of the Chairman of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) who was unjustly accused of being an agent of the Tamil Diaspora, an LTTE agent and a traitor.
Despair was on account of the emotionally charged and politically motivated attack on the academics, the Chairperson of the HRCSL and all citizens who differ in their opinion. That is shown in the rejoinder sent by Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekera turned politician sent to the media.
The Chairperson of the HRCSL Dr. Deepika Udagama has in a press interview clarified the position of the HRCSL in this regard. The two statements one by Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekera and the other by Dr. Deepika Udagama stand out clearly in contrast. The former is emotionally charged, politically motivated, unrestrained and far from polite while the latter is an unemotional intellectual and restrained response. The two statements differ even in their tone and language, the latter being more decent and diplomatic than the former.
The main allegation against the HRCSL and its Chairperson is that they were disrespectful to the members of the Security Forces who sacrificed life and limb to save the motherland from the grip of terrorism and are dancing to the tune of the Tamil Diaspora. It was Sarath Weerasekeras opinion that such persons are traitors and should be punished. Punishment for treason is death. In other words, it was a veiled death threat to a public servant for performing duties entrusted to her officially. This is not a personal threat to Dr. Deepika Udagama. It is a threat to all public servants performing their duties, which in the opinion of the ilk of Sarath Weerasekera, amounts to be agents of the LTTE. Further, any citizen with dissenting views could become a traitor according to their definition.
What has happened for him to bring out this allegation He says that the HRCSL is vetting members of the security forces that are selected for UN Peace Keeping Missions abroad prior to their departure and often there are delays and obstructions by the HRCSL.
Allegations of war crimes
This vetting was in response to a request from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs which thought that the best authority to do so is the HRCSL. In fact, it has been done earlier by a UN body and this is the first time a national body was engaged for the task. Sarath and Co. should be happy that it is a local body, not a foreign one that is vetting our soldiers credentials and record. Ironically they are the very people who call for a local judicial mechanism concerning allegations of war crimes in the last stage of the civil war in the country. What they actually are no investigation at all, whether local or foreign.
Members of the security forces should receive open indemnity and should not be touched by the law enforcement officials. Just imagine what a boost it would give crime. Already dozens of security forces personnel are indicted in the courts of law over various charges of assault, rape, murder and financial crimes. All of them would go scot free. Punishing miscreants is not a vindictive measure against the armed forces. In fact, it would enhance their prestige when its stables are cleared of such parasites. Indeed it is the practice of all civilized nations.
There were, however, delays on account of unforeseen circumstances as well as procedural causes. They were explained by the HRCSL. One was to ensure a proper vetting which would enhance the countrys prestige in the international arena and reinforce the confidence in Sri Lankan judicial processes, a vital necessity in implementing the decisions agreed upon at the United Nations.
Another allegation was that the HRCSL is for the repeal of the PTA. It is not the HRCSL but the Government of Sri Lanka that has promised to repeal it. Of course, it is to be replaced by a new law that ensures human rights. In fact, a draft law that was presented to Parliament was sent back to the Cabinet for revision. Perhaps Sarath Weerasekera being a latecomer in politics may not know that the PTA was originally brought and approved by Parliament as a temporary legislation for one year and later extended for another year. That means even its original authors knew about its Draconian nature.
All parties in the then Opposition opposed it and the SLFP walked out of the House in protest when it was brought in. Former Prime Minister Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaike was among those who demonstrated outside Hyde Park, Colombo squatting on the road junction. According to Sarath Weerasekera, all of them become traitors!
According to the PTA, anyone could be arrested on mere suspicion and kept in detention without being produced in a court of law. The place of detention could be any place desired by the Minister. It entailed strict conditions that further limited the human rights of victims.
Office of Missing Persons
The law does not respect ethnicity or religion. Thousands of Sinhala and Tamil persons, as well as representatives of Muslims, were also arrested and kept in long periods of detention. Detention did not end after 18 months. It continued under Emergency Regulations for an indefinite period until freed or indicted in courts. Detainees could appeal to the Review Board which was a toothless paper tiger and its recommendations ended in the dustbin of the relevant Ministry.
Torture was rampant under the PTA. Many were the numbers arrested on the flimsiest grounds. Some were taken up due to a mix-up of identities. No bail was available by law though it has been breached by the courts for some elite recently. Who would want such a law in the permanent Statute Book but a fascist or a dictator
Incidentally, the other objections are also to measures the Government has taken half-heartedly after much delay with regard to the provision of transitional justice to the victims of the 30-year old fratricidal war in the country, viz., the Office of Missing Persons (OMP), reparation mechanisms etc.
It is apparent that if such persons who intransigently hold on to politically motivated emotionally charged opinions of who a patriot and who a traitor is according to their own whims and fancies without any rational basis, there would be a witch-hunt against all who dissent with their opinion. There would not be any right to dissent. We could only say with Bertrand Russel that patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.

Trump vs Putin: did the world win
While the worlds geopolitics had again been shaken by the American Presidents antics, politics in our own neighbourhood also seem poised for a shakeup if former cricketer Imran Khans party comes in a close second in Pakistans general elections, this Wednesday. Polls show that Khans party may dislodge the Pakistan Peoples Party as the second biggest party in Islamabads National Assembly (parliament), enabling a possible power-sharing deal with likely winner, incumbent Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz).
Meanwhile, US President Donald Trumps summit talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin had roused a political storm in Washington and most European capitals, but the rest of the world is probably happy at the non-confrontational tone of last Mondays Helsinki summit. The American political establishment (Republican, Democrat and independent) in Washington, always wanted the US pre-eminent global position to be upheldby hook or by crookand Trumps failure in Helsinki to publicly chastise Russia for its misdemeanours was seen as a geopolitical flop. For Americas allies in the Western Alliance, NATO too, the Helsinki summit was seen as a one-up for Putin.
But the post-Helsinki world scenario may actually seem less confrontational given that, in the public eye, at least America and Russia had not been further locked into disruptive power rivalry. Even if Russia did covertly attempt to sabotage the American electoral system during the 2016 US Presidential elections, and is continuing to do so, from a global point of view, what is required is diplomatic dealings and not further confrontation simply to enforce Western political pre-eminence. However, geopolitics is not that simple.
The bigger the scale of politics, especially at world or regional level, the more it is important to assess the larger, overriding interests in relation to more micro-level and bilateral dynamics.
PTI Chariman Imran Khan.
For example, no one would want to have a nuclear war to break out in the manner in which the assassination of heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire Archduke Franz Ferdinand in June, 1914, in Sarajevo, sparked World War I that destroyed much of Europe and spread across Africa and West Asia. Likewise, it was Germanys invasion of Poland (over a cooked-up bilateral dispute) that prompted the even more devastating Second World War.
The world today, however, has become interdependent and, more importantly, warfare has become much more devastating in scale, that inter-state wars, especially if big powers are involved, cannot be considered as viable means of ensuring stability. Hence, the need for more diplomacy rather than less.
At times, even inept diplomacy could help diffuse tensionseven if temporarily. Trump is in that bracket of political incompetence and, at least twice now, his diplomatic clumsiness at an international level, had resulted in some easing of tensions.
Trumps first fruitful geopolitical clumsiness was in his meeting with North Korean President Kim Jong-un when, despite the lack of refined, systematic diplomacy by Washington (who, seemingly, were only interested in a showpiece event), Trumps desire to grab headlines, saw his ad hoc announcement to halt those annual US-led military exercises which had been the main bug-bear for Pyongyang. Whatever Washington may say about North Korea's nuclearisation and human rights, the two Koreas are currently taking advantage of the post-Singapore peace environment to re-build bilateral ties.
The second such fruitful stupidity was in Helsinki. When Trump, after meeting Putin in Helsinki, publicly refused to condemn or accuse Russia of attempting to subvert the US electoral system, there was an uproar. Even leaders of his own Republican Party administration criticised their President, ultimately compelling him, on his return, to make a (muted) recanting of that conciliatory approach to Putin.
As head of the most powerful state of the Western Alliance, Trump, should have confronted Putin with the long list of Western complaints: the so-called invasion of Ukraine, annexing of Crimea, suspected Russian-initiated assassinations of various anti-Moscow individuals in exile in the west, and covert subversion of electoral systems in USA, Germany and France.
Instead, Trump, in Helsinki, emphasised friendship and positive cooperation with Russia, while dodging all the above issues, even when pushed by journalists. That is why in America, the entire political mainstream, which presumes Americas continued world dominance, called his behaviour treasonous. Such public criticism of a head of state had never occurred in modern times, except perhaps in dictatorship situations, when the regime was isolated from the populace.
In the eyes of the US establishment as well as other Western capitals, the US President has let the side down and undermined Western dominance and legitimacy.
In most of NATOs capitals, too, there had been worry after the Helsinki summit as no one knew what was discussed in the confidential talks between Trump and Putin. Leave aside what geopolitical concessions that Trump might have made to Putin in those unrecorded talks. Such concessions could be retracted subsequently, as Trump was now done with his recant over his posture on Russian subversion.
However, everyone worries more about what intelligence information that Trump may have let slip to Putin (and any Russian recording device) during his talks. In Washington, last year, Trump revealed to visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, certain Israeli intelligence sources pertaining to the Western worlds struggle to contain Islamist-fascist militancy.
Trumps such betrayals of information and national policy arises not out of some sophisticated and subtle geopolitical acumen. Rather, it arises from sheer ineptness, lack of sensitivity to his countrys geopolitical interests (he is too unintelligent and uncaring to learn), and from his narcissism and individualistic political opportunism.
It was the same with the Helsinki summit, last week. Watching the Trump-Putin post-summit news conference live last Monday, for this writer, the defining moment was when American reporters pressed their President whether he thought Russia had covertly attempted to sabotage the US electoral system. The world waited with bated breath.
If Trump had chosen to criticise Russia at that moment, he would have further locked the US (and the Western Alliance) into continued confrontation with Moscow. Instead, Trump hedged and denied that Russia had meddled in the US electoral system and cast doubts on his own intelligence and defence institutions that insist that Russia did so and continues to do so.
For much of the world (including Putin), Trumps words immediately took down world tensions a point or two. The avoidance of publicly locking in the Russia-US relationship to the old confrontational postures, had done the trick, in terms of larger global geopolitical tensions.
No doubt, this public denigration of his own national security establishment by a head of state, is unnecessarily damaging to the political standing of his country and, clearly, it undermines that countrys defence systems. In those terms, Trump had rendered his country an immense disservicewhich it certainly does not deserve. No country deserves to be put down by its own leader at a crucial public forum (Helsinki), in front of another major world leader (presumed to be a rival state) and in front of the global public.
Thus, the outrage in Washington is fully understandable; likewise, the nervousness and worry in the capitals of the USs allies.
These allies, however, had already begun to realise that that the old alliance is no more what it was. NATOs crucial plank of collective self-defence (one for all and all for one), was rendered unreliable from the moment the leader of the main power underwrote that defence questioned it. Donald Trump questioned it even before he became President and had continued to do so to date. Even last week, in a TV interview, he argued that it was not worth for the worlds major powers to go war just because one small countryhe took Montenegro as an examplewas attacked.
Donald Trump had undermined numerous international treaties due to this simplistic unilateralism and disdain for previously made bilateral and international commitments. But, by default, as it were, his self-serving opportunism was also shaking the world system and its primary backers out of residual Cold War postures and old-style, dominance-based geopolitics.
If one maverick at a global-level is shaking up certain rigid systems, possibly for the better, at least in some ways, Imran Khan might just do the same this week in Pakistans parliamentary general elections. His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI - Pakistan Movement for Justice), which he founded in 1996, is poised to overtake the traditionally powerful Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP - founded by the Bhutto family), to become the second most powerful parliamentary party, if the opinion polls are right. Khan, a cricketing legend, had proved to be equally headline-grabbing in his subsequent flamboyant political career in building up his own party during the past decade. While polls indicate that the incumbent governing party, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), is likely to win the biggest number of seats, Khans PTI is likely to play a role in forming the next government in Islamabad.
This may well bring up a new, perhaps positive equation in Pakistani politics.

Undying love
Wedding venues can be a headache to find; the location, the size, cost, guest capacity just adds difficult dimensions to the labyrinth that is wedding planning.
Thinking outside the box might help tackle a few of your problems though.
Rebecca Walker and Graeme Boothroyd did exactly that, tying the knot in the chapel of Huddersfield Crematorium in West Yorkshire. Yes, thats right, you can get married in the place where a dead persons body is burned to ashes. And why not
Its the first wedding of its kind and isnt just some cost-effective choice for Rebecca and Graeme, but has sentimental value; its where they first met.
Rebecca, an independent civil celebrant, and Graeme, who works as a technician for Kirklees Councils Bereavement Services, felt it was an obvious choice after a chance first meeting at the crematorium.
The pair had met as part of their jobs in bereavement services, connecting over a broken coffee machine.
I had to ask Graeme to come and sort it out and one thing led to another, explained Rebecca. He asked if I was with anyone and when I said no and he gave me his phone number  and I rang him before I even got home! I cant believe its only 10 months that we have been together. We are like two peas in a pod. Its a building thats filled with love and you can feel that when people are going into it. It has everything you could want, beautiful grounds and excellent facilities. They had never heard of anyone doing that before. We didnt want it to be a morbid occasion. The pair invited 90 guests and made arrangements to be respectful to others using the space for more somber reasons and once the ceremony was over everything was returned to normal.
If thats sparked a desire for you to book out your local crematorium, you could speak to your local council.
Paul Kemp, service director at Kirklees Council said, Whilst the crematorium is usually a place where we mark the passing of life, we feel there is no reason, why, in the right circumstances, it shouldnt be used for other ceremonies and we would consider future requests on a case-by-case basis.
Itll definitely be a wedding to remember. Metro

Unqualified SAITM students want KDU Act re-amended
There were 54 unqualified students in SAITM and they do not have the minimum qualifications required to be absorbed into the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU). Now they are trying their best to influence politicians and high-ranking officials to re-amend the KDU Act, media spokesman of the State Medical Students Parents Union Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said that action should be taken against the officials who recruited those 54 unqualified students to SAITM because now they cannot enter the KDU without sitting for examinations. Therefore, they want to re-amend the Act in order to enter KDU without the required minimum educational qualifications.
According to Alwis, those unqualified 54 SAITM students are from the families who tried their best to save SAITM in the past by holding several press conferences. During those press conferences, they said that their children are more talented and qualified than state medical students, but now their children are scared to sit for examinations outside SAITM.
If they are really qualified and talented, there is no reason to avoid examinations.
The University Grants Commission (UGC) did not give the educational qualifications of SAITM students when the details were requested by the State Medical Students Parents Union under the Right to Information Act.
The Chairman of the UGC should be removed and a qualified and unbiased scholar should be appointed to this position because the current Chairman has already tarnished his image and tarnished the image of the UGC by openly supporting fraudulent institutions such as SAITM and promoting private medical education while suppressing and neglecting state medical education, he said.

You are when you eat
Eating dinner late increases your risk of two deadly cancers, experts have warned. And not leaving at least two hours between scoffing your last meal of the day and hitting the hay, also hikes your chances of developing breast and prostate cancer.
Meal times may affect the bodys ability to process food, boffins at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health said. They found people who eat dinner before 9 pm or two hours before nodding off were 20 per cent less likely to develop the diseases.
The scientists looked at the diet and lifestyles of 621 patients with prostate cancer, 1,205 people with breast cancer and a control group pf 2,193, who didnt have cancer.
Those who considered themselves morning types, rather than night owls, had a 33 per cent lower risk if they ate early.They found people who eat dinner before 9pm or two hours before nodding off were 20 per cent less likely to develop the diseases
Breast and prostate cancers are among those most strongly associated with night-shift work and body clock disruption.
Cancer prevention advice has previously focused more on what people eat, rather than when.
Prof Manolis Kogevinas, who led the study, said If these findings are confirmed they will have profound implications on recommendations for the timing of the last main meal.The impact could be especially important in cultures such as those of southern Europe where people have supper late.
Dora Romaguera, who also worked on the study, said: Everything seems to indicate that the timing of sleep affects our capacity to metabolise food.
She said more research is needed to added the animal data shows profound implications for food metabolism and health.The findings are published in the International Journal of Cancer. The Sun
