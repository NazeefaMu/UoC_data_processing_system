Emerging technologies likely to democratize financial services
The increase in the use of technology is changing the face of the entire banking and financial sector by filling the void of inaccessibility to financial services, Path Solutions - Kuwait, Group Chairman and CEO Mohammed Kateeb said.
Delivering the key note address on Technology Impact on Future Financial Services at the Islamic Finance Forum of South Asia held in Colombo yesterday , Kateeb said that emerging technologies and disruptions would democratize financial services and products in the near future.
The financial sector is continuously coming up with new and seamless ways to provide services to the global population and emerging technologies and disruptions will have a transformative impact on overall banking and financial sector.
He noted that technology offers various components to enable financial institutions to provide amazing customer experience and to introduce a host of innovative products and services.
He further noted that banks and financial institutions will be compelled to move into openness owing to emerging technologies in the respective sector and this would lead to complete democratization of financial services.
There is a lot of pressure on central banks around the world to actually move into this direction.
According to Kateeb, regulators are already forcing banks in Europe to open their services to the public in a speedy manner. In the meantime, Public Enterprise Development and Patron Association of Alternate Finance (AAFI) Sri Lanka, Kabir Hashim speaking at the event pointed out that countries all over the world are adopting alternate finance and institutions such as ADB and World Bank acknowledge alternate finance as a key instrument in the financial structure of the world . This establishes the fact that Islamic Finance as a key financing source for investment both in advanced and developing countries and also as an ideal platform to diversify funding and curtailing risk exposure at both institutional and macroeconomic level. How fast the industry grows and how best it can be used for the development of the country, should be left in the hands of industry stakeholders. the Minister noted.
Islamic banking offers various sophisticated different types of instruments such as Islamic mortgages, car loans, credit cards, insurance, Islamic finance managed hedge funds which has come into the concept of alternate finance , the minister said.
The minister also underscored the need to organize brainstorming sessions and workshops to make the Islamic Finance industry more applicable, practicable and more popular among the people.
According to the Ministry, in 2014, there were over 75 countries all over the world, using alternate finance operating more than 300 institutions. The Minister further added that alternate finance assets account for more than US $ 2 trillion, and is expected to grow to US$ 3.5 trillion by 2020.

MR had plans to rent out Hambantota seaport, airport
Southern Provincial Minister H.W. Gunasena said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had plans to rent out the Hambantota seaport and Mattala airport to China, but today he supported protest campaigns against the purpose.
The Provincial Minister was addressing a meeting held at Teldeniya.
The SPC Minister said the Joint Opposition must do something unique to attract people rather than protesting. He recalled that protests could not be carried out during former Presidents regime.
He said Mahinda Rajapaksa sold 2,000 acres to foreign investors.
The members of the joint opposition wanted them to be remanded to get the public attention, he said. The SPC Minister said the country could not be developed without foreign investments. He said the Government would govern the country even beyond 2020.

New Constitution will not promote division
Various parties and stakeholders have submitted different proposals towards formulating a new Constitutions. They are only the ideas and views of the respective parties and stakeholders. But a new Constitution draft bill has not even been formulated, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
Given that situation, certain politicians are tying to create a storm in a teacup by uttering falsehoods about a new Constitutions which had not even been drafted yet, he said.
The minister said he would categorically state that they would never allow to harm the pre- eminent position afforded to Buddhism or a division of the country through the proposed new Constitution.
He was addressing a meeting after inaugurating the construction work on the Viharamahadevipura fisheries housing scheme in Kirinda on October 22. This is the third such village built under the Dheevara Piyasa programme.
The minister said the Dheevara Piyasa housing programme was formulated by the ministry to relieve the fishery community from debt.
This was different to certain other housing schemes which made the beneficiaries indebted to banks.

That 1987 grenade attack
The 1987 grenade attack in the Sri Lankan Parliament is an incident that shocked many and is still reflected upon today. A grenade attack took place on August 18, 1987, when an assailant hurled two grenades into a room where government Members of Parliament were meeting.
The grenades bounced off the table at which President J. R. Jayawardene and Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa were sitting, and rolled away. A Member of Parliament and a Ministry secretary were killed by the explosions. According to a government press officer who was at the meeting, pandemonium reigned following the explosions.
He said some legislators thought Parliament was under attack. Using wooden chairs, they broke the thin plate glass overlooking the Parliament lawn to escape the room, and were immediately bundled into cars and driven away.
The incident occurred as Parliament prepared to convene for the first time since the signing of an accord with India last month that was intended to end four years of warfare waged by the ethnic Tamil minority. Authorities said that instead of fleeing after the incident, those responsible might have simply stayed on the scene and blended into the chaos.
A subsequent Police investigation concluded that the grenades were thrown by a member of the banned Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) organisation, which was staging a rebellion in the country at the time. Five members of the JVP were eventually put on trial for the attack, but were acquitted, due to lack of evidence. It is believed the attack targeted President Jayawardene for his signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord.
Member of Parliament for the Matara District Keerthi Abeywickrama, whose face was blown off due to the explosion, was carried outside and rushed to hospital, but died on the way there. Norbert Senadeera, an official with the Parliament staff, died later of a shrapnel wound to the head. Sixteen others were injured in the attack, including National Security Advisor Lalith Athulathmudali, Prime Minister Premadasa and Ministers Gamini Jayasuriya, Montague Jayawickrema and E. L. B. Hurulle. President J. R. Jayewardene escaped injury.

AGs preliminary objections overruled; FR petition filed by Perpetual Treasuries fixed for support
The Supreme Court yesterday decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Attorney General regarding the Fundamental Rights petition filed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) and fixed the petition for support on November 2.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilleke appearing on behalf the Attorney General raised preliminary objections against the Fundamental Rights petition filed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) that challenged the Central Bank's decision to suspend Perpetual Treasuries Limited from carrying out business and other activities as a Primary Dealer.
The Attorney General informed court that the petitioner cannot invoke Supreme Court's Fundamental Rights jurisdiction in terms of Article 14(1) (g) of the constitution since the petitioner is not a Sri Lankan citizen. The Attorney General further moved court that the petition be dismissed in limine taking into consideration the allegations levelled against the petitioner over a controversial bond issue.
In its petition, the PTL alleged that the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka had made this order without having carried out any proper inquiry into the affairs of PTL. The petitioner is seeking an interim order to suspend the Monetary Board decision. The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on July 06, acting in terms of the Regulations made under the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance, had decided to suspend Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) from carrying on the business and activities of a Primary Dealer for a period of six months with effect from July 06, 2017. President's Counsel Gamini Marapana with Navin Marapana appeared for the PTL. Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilleke appeared for the Attorney General.

Arjun Aloysius lied to COPE: Palisena reveals - UPDATED

Following rigorous questioning from the Attorney Generals Department and the tribunal of the Treasury Bond Commission, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Kasun Palisena stated that PTL owner Arjun Aloysius lied to the COPE sub-committee investigating into the Treasury bond issue regarding his involvement in the operational activities of PTL.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake took Palisena through a series of questions on certain statements made by Arjun Aloysius to the COPE sub-committee on his resignation from the post of PTL CEO and his involvement in the daily activities of the PTL.
According to the statement given by Aloysius to the COPE sub-committee, he stepped down from the post of CEO of the PTL due to the conflict of interest that arose when Arjun Mahendran, his father-in-law, became the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
While pointing out that certain telephone call recordings between Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena reveals that the former was instructing the latter how to and how much to be for at what rates, DSG Gunatilake suggested that Aloysius in that case has lied to the COPE investigation.
DSG Gunatilake argued that Aloysius in fact, contrary to his statement to the COPE, involved himself in PTLs day-to-day activities when it comes to dealing and other operational activities.
Palisena, who was testifying before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue, initially denied that Aloysius has lied to the COPE.
Did not Aloysius involve himself in daily dealing activities of the PTL, as suggested by these telephone call conversations DSG Gunatilake asked. Not always. Only if there is important Palisena in reply said. Ah, that means Aloysius involved himself only in big things DSG Gunatilake queried. Palisena then said Aloysius did involve himself with PTL trading activities, but not always and regularly.
DSG Gunatilake then asked Palisena, whether or not PTL recorded large profits at certain Treasury bond auctions, by taking trading decisions according to instructions given by Aloysius. Palisena again gave an answer suggesting that Aloysius was not involved with PTL activities regularly.
The Commissioner Supreme Court Judge P.S. Jayawardena specifically questioned Palisena on if Aloysiuss involvement in PTL activities was of an operational nature, to which Palisena did not give a clear answer.
Justice Jayawardena then asked Palisena to read out another portion of testimony given by Aloysius to COPE where Aloysius explains that had he been involved in PTL trading activities, it definitely would have been in operational activities.
He was then asked to consider his answer according to what Aloysius told the COPE investigation. Palisena seemed unconvinced that Aloysiuss involved himself in PTL activities on a daily basis. He repeated another He (Aloysius) was involved but not always. to the suggestion.
Following Palisenas reply, Chairman of the Commission Supreme Court Judge K.T. Chitrasiri observed that It is very difficult to get an answer from you,  referring to Kasun Palisena.
Justice Jayawardena then took the reins to his hand and questioned Palisena on the matter at hand:
Justice Jayawardena: Now, dont fool around. When Aloysius said to the COPE that he is not going to involve in operational activities of PTL, was he lying or not
The witness remains silent.
JJ: Do you know the meaning of a lie
The witness still remains silent.
JJ: Did he lie or not
Kasun Palisena: He has.
Following the answer Chairman Justice K.T. Chitrasiri observed that Kasun Palisena took two minutes to answer the question.
DSG Gunatilake also questioned Palisena if Arjun Aloysius was aware of PTL using its customers securities without their consent or awareness for other deals. Palisena denied such activity.
Palisena was also questioned on another portion of Aloysiuss statement to COPE with regards to his instructions to PTL as he stepped down from his post as CEO. According to Aloysius, he has instructed PTL to act accordingly to the Central Bank regulations when trading in the market. Justice Jayawardena asked Palisena if Aloysius have this instruction in a memo or any other written form. Palisena said no such written memo was given by Aloysius.
JJ: So we are not inclined to believe you that Aloysius actually instructed so. If PTL violated Central Bank regulations, would Aloysius have known about it
Palisena: Necessarily would have.
JJ: Central Bank charges that PTL violated regulations with regards to day-to-day operations. So Aloysius knew these violations
P: Yes, he would have.
JJ: So was Aloysius deliberately lying
Palisena did not provide a clear answer to the question.
Chairman Justice K.T Chitrasiri in a lighter tone added, This is like husband not knowing what wife does! causing much laughter among those who were present at the courtroom.
Meanwhile, Palisena also denied knowing anything or to have given instruction to delete telephone call recordings or to crash the voice logger computer of the PTL call recording system. According to Palisena he thought all call recordings were handed over to the investigators of the commission.
Asked if then PTL IT executive Sachit Devatantri is lying about the computer crashing under Palisenas instructions, the witness said he is not aware of IT matters and went on to saying that who would crash a computer while referring how-to videos on Youtube.
DSG Gunatilake pointed out when Salgado testified that Palisena instructed to delete calls and crash the computer, no counsels objected him in this regard. Palisena denied knowing anything about crashing computers and deleting calls.
A telephone conversation between Kasun Palisena and Kavin Karunamoorthy was then played before the commission suggesting that Palisena proposed to fabricate a call requested by the Central Bank for investigation on PTL.
The conversation has taken place in November 2015, regarding a certain deal. In the conversation, Palisena seemingly proposes Karunamoorthy that Api wena (call) ekak karamuda because there is much slang incorporated in the initial call conversation.
Palisena denied that he was suggesting fabricating a call conversation in replace of the original. He also denied knowing PTL call recording system having the ability to record the call information such as time and caller ID.
DSG Gunatilake pointed out that Palisena among thousands of call recordings, has identified and given to the Central Bank specific call recordings by using date, time and caller ID which is contrary to his affidavit to the Treasury bond commission.
DSG Gunatilake called Palisena an unrepentant liar and suggested that Palisena lied to the Treasury Bond Commission. Palisena said he denied the suggestion made by DSG Gunatilake.
The commission several time requested Palisena to answer truthfully to questions put to him. Justice Jayawardena went on to say Mr. Palisena, at least out of courtesy, try to make in believable when you are lying! Palisena however was adamant that he was not lying.
It was also revealed before the commission that Palisena received a nine-digit bonus from his company. Justice Jayawardena asked if Palisena has a personal interest in the well being of PTL, when proving PTL has done nothing wrong in the Treasury bond issue, to which Palisena answered in a reluctant affirmation.
When asked about a reference to a payment of Rs. 1 million to a Little Johnny as a bosss payment, Palisena said the said Little Johnny could be anybody. He went on to say that it is a term like podi-en which they used for small customers or dealers they are transacting with.
DSG Gunatilake: So who is Little Jonny
Palisena: Little Jonny can be anyone!
DSG: Can I suggest to you that there is a limit to lying
P: Ah
DSG: Oh, you think there is no limit to lying!

The commission will sit again on Monday (18).

## Title: ASMITA  A chilling and introspective novel
## Supertitle:

ASMITA  A chilling and introspective novel
This eponymous novel by Seneka Abeyratne (published Dr Cicero Books, New York, in 2017) is a fast-paced narrative which relates the life of a beautiful, highly-intelligent, freelance prostitute from Colombo 7. At 23, she reveals much of her life in flashbacks. Asmita is just 9 years old when she hears her mother screaming in the bedroom one warm, sunny afternoon. Peeping through the keyhole, she is shocked by what she sees. The housemaid pushes her aside and chides her for peeping. But the damage is done. The girl is completely traumatized by what she sees.
After a one night stand, a Canadian businessman (John) falls desperately and inexplicably in love with Asmita. Later, the pervasive influence of the subconscious over rationale behaviour is analysed and presented to the reader by the protagonist herself in psychological terms. An existentialist reader would be disappointed when the story delves into surrealism, with rebirth playing an important role. But when Asmita dreams of her previous life (as Kanthi), she is oblivious to the consequences of this startling surreal experience.
However, what is great about this novel is not the supernatural elements but the will, attitude and honesty of Asmita (self in Sinhalese) when set against the corruption, pretence and brutality she has to deal with from the outside.
The crux of the matter is: Why does Asmita hate herself Why does such a cultured girl groomed for an Ivy League education turn to prostitution The answers to these questions, which she herself struggles to find, are both internal and external to Asmita; in the latter sense, they are embedded in a mosaic of domestic violence, poverty, alcoholism, political machinations and traditional/religious beliefs that inhibit rational thinking.
The main female characters are heroic and  except for Aunty Amrita (Asmitas yoga teacher) and Mihiri (Kanthis elder daughter)  destined to suffer some form of martyrdom. Asmita, the protagonist, is self-willed and refined:
... Can the life of a hooker have purpose and meaning Indeed it can, if she has a peg to hang her coat on  not any kind of peg, but a spiritual peg. As contradictory as it may sound, it is possible for someone like me, who is both a skeptic and an atheist, to be spiritual if she has a leaning towards philosophy and incorporates some kind of systematic spiritual and physical training into her lifestyle, such as yoga.
She has a passion for geography and an addiction to sex, as well as discerning tastes in psychology, classical music, and art. She is sarcastic and snappish when provoked. She is also a noble soul, giving money to Theruni (her masseuse) to buy a motor scooter when she learns that Theruni had been obliged to sell hers in order to help her financially strapped brother. She is a victim of corrupt/terror politics and misogyny as well as cruel rejection by a father (Mahesh), who is obsessed by wealth and social status and is quite immune to the emotional needs of a deeply sensitive child.
Asmita and Theruni come from different social classes, but both are victims of misogyny  the main theme of the novel. Kanthi, whose loyalty to her violent and abusive husband, Senerath, is as profound as her love for her two daughters; the dismissed servant (with no name); and Rashmi, Asmitas emotionally tormented mother: all invoke pity. Senerath is a symbol of corruption and brutality and his repentance at the end is unforgettable.
The innocence of John and Asmita, juxtaposed against the brutality of Senarath and his henchmen, will leave a hallucinatory impression in the readers mind. Asmitas words to John, I love you, are poignant because they come a little too late.
Abeyratne commands the attention of the reader through suspense and visual imagery. The world-weary Rashmis decision to renounce her possessions and spend the rest of her life in an ashram recalls Narayans protagonists in The English Teacher and The Vendor of Sweets. The usually reticent mothers sudden urgency and calm decisiveness is dramatic, if not heroic. Asmitas negative vibes about Seneraths island lair and how her heart skips a beat when Senerath reveals his true identity are instances of masterful storytelling. When at the end Asmita snubs her father and decides to fight her battles alone, the latter is deeply wounded.
Visual imagery in ASMITA is provocative and haunting. It is seductive from the very first scene where the enchanting hooker and the blue-eyed millionaire sip alcohol to the soft music of a deluxe bar before slipping into bed. The language describing Kanthis last moments in the asylum and her younger daughters (Sabeethas) tragic death create haunting images.
ASMITA is a timely criticism of a cross section of Sri Lankan society. It analyses the forces that inhibit progress and drag us into poverty and violence. The protagonist, in a stream of reflections, identifies the root causes as the absence of an empowering educational system and the tendency of humans to view violence as the logical means to an end. The power of the subconscious and social neuroses are key terms. Abeyratne is bold in his criticism of religious practice. He points to the pseudo-fatalistic approach to karma, and the preach-only policy that many people adhere to. Aunty Amrita, whose yogic discipline is exemplary, represents the zenith of humanity:
Do not judge a person by his appearance or the size of his house or the brand of his car. Respect those who are kind, sincere, industrious and self-reliant.
The language of ASMITA is very much like the protagonist herself: powerful and sophisticated. Apart from local terms, foreign expressions are sprinkled throughout the novel. The language tries to convey a Sri Lankanness and succeeds to a great extent. However, a sensitive reader would notice a few minor lapses in this regard. For example, children from rural/suburban backgrounds would rarely call their parents ammi/thaaththi, as Sabeetha and Mihiri do. They would normally call them amma/thaaththa. Make no mistake though. Abeyratnes command of prose is technically brilliant and this is what makes the book unputdownable. - Lochana Liyanage

Basketball legend Cosmas Perera  chief guest at Benedictine Colours Night
Benedictines are felicitating one of the greatest sportsmen in the schools 152-year history, when the first Benedictine ever to captain a national sports team, basketball legend Cosmas Perera Mahagama, will do the honours at the annual Benedictine Colours Night on November 3 at the Defence Services School Auditorium, Malay Street, Colombo 2.
On this occasion, Benedictine sportsmen, from all disciplines, will receive their awards for their achievements in 2016 and College colours will be awarded to the most outstanding performers.
Cosmas Perera had the distinction of captaining the Ceylon basketball team for 12 consecutive years from 1963, when only 22 years of age, to 1974, when he handed over the baton to another fellow Old Benedictine Rienzie de Silva. At school, he first tried his hand at cricket, being the opening bowler and the opening batsman in the Under 12 side of 1954, coached by Bro.Boniface FSC.
Thereafter, he was a member of the College Junior Cadet Corps 1955/56. After a close friend invited him to join the junior basketball trials and was selected for the team, which went on to win the All Island Junior Championship for the very first time in 1958 under late Winston Wijenayake. The champion junior team was asked by the Director of the College Frenchman Bro. Athanatius FSC to travel to Jaffna, as a reward, and also take part in the Senior Basket Championships. They returned home after winning the Senior Championship, again for the first time, much to the delight of the sports loving Brother Athanatius.
Thereafter, it was winning championships one after another, with the Benedictines dominating the schools basketball scene for many decades. Cosmas gives the credit for his and his teams successes to the legendary Benedictine coach Ram Sundaralingam, who was a member of the staff of the college. It was Sunda as he was fondly called, who taught him basketball techniques and tactics to make him a total all court player. While his great friend late Percy Perera was recognized as the Best Shooter in Asia in the 1960s, Cosmas was renowned for his brilliant dribbling skills, thrilling the spectators. Cosmas started playing for Old Bens in 1963 and Old Bens dominated the local basketball scene from that time till he emigrated with his family to the United States in 1975, beating the strong Army and the Orients BC, time after time in tournament finals. He recalls the epic battles on the court with Rohan Daluwatte (later General) of the Army and Roydon de Silva of the Orients BC and the nail-biting finishes at many Championship finals for the Exter Shield, which was the most coveted Trophy at that time.
Cosmas captained Ceylon at the first ever Basketball Quadrangular held in Colombo in1964, with the participation of national teams from India, Pakistan and Iran. He is still in full praise for the excellent organization of the event, due to the untiring efforts of great sporting gentlemen of that time, late J.J.Sarangapany, late Wilfred Saverimuttu, and late Joe Daniel. He also captained Ceylon at the Asian Basketball Tournament in Lahore, Pakistan in 1965 and the Asian Games in Bangkok, Thailand in 1966. He also toured India with the national team several times and learnt much from his Indian counterparts and coaches, during those visits.
His alma mater St.Benedicts College is honouring a national great, who has brought much honour and glory to it during his playing days. Cosmas is domiciled presently in California, USA but spends some months every year in Sri Lanka.

## Title: BCC makes representations on Budget 2018

BCC makes representations on Budget 2018
The Business Chamber of Commerce (BCC), which was founded 2000, issued a statement with its observations and proposals on the National Budget 2018 together with selective comments on the state of the economy.
BCC is pleased that despite numerous setbacks the country has had to face during 2016, it has been able to achieve a GNP growth rate of over 4.5% last year.
In fact, according to Census Department, the country did achieve a slightly improved growth rate during the second quarter of 2017, but the question that looms large is why the state revenue which is a part of the GNP had in more recent years shown a downward trend.
In contrast, the revenue generated was around 10% of GNP in and around the 1990s. Above this, three decades ago it reached a high point of 20%.
However, we note that between 2014 and 2016 it did increase by 3-4%.
It is important for the state to investigate and establish the reasons as to why the revenue targets are not met. This surely is an important exercise when considering that the government is repeatedly confronted with the task of increasing revenue in order to meet spiraling domestic expenditure especially by way of providing an array of services to the public besides meeting the continuously rising wages bill and other connected payments to over 1.3 million state functionaries throughout the island.
It is in this context the government has introduced a new Inland Revenue Act. But before venturing into commenting on the new Act, we intend to examine other aspects of economic development that will help the country to reach new heights of growth. At this stage of our representations, we wish to comment on exports which is of primary importance to the nation. Exports are key to more favourable balance of payments. At the present time, the economy is faced with not only a heavy imbalance of trade but also with a formidable debt burden which are unfortunately recurrent features in current times.
In order to have a proper assessment on exports, we need to examine the export performance of the country in 2016 and 2017. In 2016, there was a contraction in exports, in respect of both agricultural and industrial exports. But during the first half of 2017, the situation showed an improvement in regard to both groups of exports.
Industrial exports increased by 13% and main agricultural products - especially tea has shown a welcome upward trend (17.8%)
On the other hand, though the increases are not excessively high they are encouraging in spite of the fact international marketing conditions were not buoyant.
In any case, there is an obvious and vital need to bring about a vast improvement to the export picture as against the need to curb runaway expenditure on imports.
It is an oft-repeated truism that recurrent imbalances, whether they be favourable or unfavorable are bad especially the latter. If you look at the global picture of international trade, favourable balance of large trading nations continuously distorts global trading patterns. Two examples of nations whose favourable balances are considered harmful are China and Germany.
These countries over the years have had favourable balances of trade and their adverse impact on their principal trading partners has been severe.
The United States is one nation that is highly critical of this situation and has threatened to raise tariff barriers in order to curb excessive imports. This has raised the spectre of protectionism or economic nationalism. It will be also harmful to smaller trading nations like Sri Lanka.
Our export strategy needs to undergo radical change. The key words in this connection are product and market diversification besides value addition and innovation.
From a macro perspective how could Sri Lanka achieve these goals We could of course gain inspiration from a few nations which provide the right environment and conditions besides coordination between institutions in the public and private sectors.
Both Vietnam and Bangaladesh are apparently well ahead of us in export generation. The latter is diversifying its product base by going into areas like pharmaceutical production. They are fast emulating the new pharmaceutical hubs in Asia - India and Pakistan. It is necessary to mention a vital economic input in this connection which is considered a priority by progressive nations namely competitiveness. In theory, competitiveness like trade bestows prosperity on the people. The GDP remains the best barometer to judge competitiveness. Also the rate of GDP growth in terms of PPP or purchasing power parity is a sound means of evaluating the progress of a nation and whether it is moving in the right direction. BCC would like to propose the establishment of councils on competitiveness in relevant areas of both the public and private sectors in the tradition of other progressive countries.
Sri Lanka has yet to gain ground in respect of value addition. However, a few companies in the field of tea exports have achieved some success through the introduction of new varieties of tea in the export markets. One example is iced tea in bottles which are gaining ground in retail outlets and becoming popular as a beverage in European markets.
Similarly, Sri Lanka is successful in the use of raw rubber to produce vehicle tyres and tubes but the progress achieved by individual exporters do not constitute a national endeavour.
Constant innovation and research on market development should take precedence in the nation's export effort. Research and development and a tie up between the private sector and research institutions in the public sector should be a vital aspect of export development. Sri Lanka though a mixed economy for ages is increasingly dependent on the private sector to generate more economic activity. In this context, it is important that the two sectors should closely work with each other so as to achieve better coordination in private sector operations.
Importantly, companies cannot work in isolation. We wish to refer to bilateral trade tie-ups with two of our large neighbours  India and Pakistan. Sri Lanka has experienced a number of non-tariff barriers which have forestalled exports in particular to India,
Though such non-tariff barriers have been discussed frequently at different fora, no positive results have been achieved. It is necessary that the state officials should take this issue up with their counterparts in India at the highest levels. It is equally necessary for the state sector to realize that the private sector cannot operate in a vacuum. A frequent refrain of the business community is that quite apart from supporting enterprises, the bureaucracy through a host of procedures inhibit the private sector. There are many examples to cite.
One such example is the sugar manufacturing project with foreign collaboration in which the local party who is a member of our chamber is involved. The project has not yet been implemented due to red tape and inordinate delays.
The second is a proposal submitted by another member of the chamber to utilize abandoned and idle tea estates owned by the government in the Matale district. The idea was to plant spices on a large scale for which Matale is ideal.
This is on account of the fact that that the demand for spices in overseas markets is favourable but the supply is inadequate.
Sri Lanka is indeed fortunate that the European Union has restored GSP Plus which was deprived to the country for five years. This is to the credit of the present government which launched a sustained campaign to regain GSP plus.
Presently the EU offers Sri Lanka duty free concessions to as many as 1,400 export items. This creates ideal conditions to this country that needs further exploration of the EU markets
A mini boom in exports to the EU was observed despite the loss of duty free access.
During the period GSP Plus was not available to Sri Lanka, some local exports did exceptionally well in the EU market. This is encouraging.
During the period under reference when GSP Plus was unavailable, our total exports declined to 13% from 90% of the main 10 items. Among the items worst hit were apparels and garments which were reduced to 5% and fish and diamond exports by 65% and 93% respectively.
Somewhat surprisingly, coconut oil exports saw phenomenal increase by 3,500%. Essential oils and herbal extracts by 138%, fruit and vegetable by 71% and processed food by 10%. Electronics exports also achieved a major breakthrough in the EU market when their exports increased by 40%. Coconut fibre, leather goods, tobacco and toys also fared well in that market.
All these achievements were reflective of the dynamism and enterprise of the newly emergent export community who achieved this over a five-year period during which period GSP Plus was not available to Sri Lanka.
A proactive overseas trade commissioner/overseas representative service should be based in different continents and tasked with the responsibility of identifying markets and investment opportunities in their respective stations. It is vital that they should be
highly communicative and oriented towards transmitting information to Sri Lanka constantly.
The two state agencies - Department of Commerce and Export Development Board - have a renewed role to play in trade promotion if Sri Lanka is to achieve the declared goal of being an export hub.
We earlier mentioned that a new Inland Revenue Act will be effective from April 2018.
This chambers concern in this regard rests largely on corporate activity especially,
(a) exports, (b) domestic investment, (c) foreign direct investment and (d) taxation including duties, revenue collection and compliance.
The new Act is balanced and more equitable to the middle class whereas it taxes the rich in a bigger way. It thus benefits the broader segment of society.
But we would like to add a note of caution that capital formation and savings together with a reasonable tax and duty regime are factors that contribute to economic growth. True enough that debenture issues launched in the course of this year are indicative of a favorable climate in financial entities like banks. A cursory examination will show that most buyers of such debentures were the corporate sector and not the public at large. This defeats the intentions of the government to create a class of share-owning people in the country.
We are pleased that the introduction of the capital gains tax is likely to bring black money into the tax system in particular, through hitherto undeclared sources of income.
The introduction of enhanced penalties should indeed be made effective and be pursued without fear or favour. It will enlarge the tax net and enable those who try to avoid payment of tax which in the past had been an unfortunate feature in this country. Exporters are of the view that 0.5% service charge acts as a disincentive to export generation. This is particularly in the context of rising domestic costs associated with export production. It also adds to the rising shipping and logistical costs.
We urge the government to remove the economic service charge.

Better choice for Parliament
Apropos recent letters to the Editor by Peter Wijetunge and Dr A C Visvalingam followed by another letter to the Editor by Edward Gunawardena on the subject of introducing new clauses for a better Parliament.
At the outset, my view is that Wijetunges suggestion seems practical only for Local Govt. Elections provided they are held in a de-politicised environment devoid of any political hues. A proposal to depoliticize Local Government elections was made by the writer through an article to the press titled An alternate system to Local Govt. elections as far back as in 1997. Well after 20 years it appears that some people still need Political intervention to resolve their problems. The stubborn fact is that many times, people tend to go behind politicians to get undue favours done!
Select political professionals
In our view, the real solution lies in enhancing the work ethic, efficiency and effectiveness of the systems and procedures in the Govt. Offices, Police and the Judiciary. Under a robust decentralized public administration system buttressed by advanced information and communication technology, free media and easy transport, we should surely jettison our overt dependence and subservience to politicians at all levels.
I would now respond to Dr A C Visvalingam and Edward Gunawardena on the subject of selecting professional candidates for the much larger Provincial and National Parliaments. People have witnessed the recurring, unprofessional conduct and unproductive contributions from many of our present Mace-raiding Provincial Councillors and Parliamentarians who make a mockery out of the sacred Parliament system! The shattered and disillusioned voting public now crave for Good and disciplined behaviour and enhanced productivity from the Provincial and Central Parliaments through the selection of a decent, honest, uncorrupt, ethical and a principled set of political professionals who will always place the country first on their agenda.
Hitherto, our voters have exhibited a good sense in changing Governments. But in regard to the selection of individual candidates, they have failed miserably. For example, they have voted teledrama actresses and cricketers beating experienced politicians. They have also sent to parliament, inexperienced candidates defeating efficient parliamentarians as well as candidates languishing in remand jail for criminal acts. Let us not hide the fact that our sincere and simple voters are swayed by temporary handouts/bribes in the form of cash and kind doled out by money throwing and notoriously popular politicians.
Methodology for selecting candidates
In this scenario, the only alternative is to compel the respective parties to both select and field their best teams of political professionals in District-wise merit order to achieve the goals of the country as well as the goals of their respective Election Manifestos at provincial and National level.
For this purpose, the parties as corporate entities should introduce at the behest of the Elections Dept/Commission, a robust, unbiased and a very transparent process of screening followed by a meticulously structured interview method to select their nominees. The screening criteria already set out by Paffrel through the All-party March 12th declaration surely had a salutary effect on party nominations at the last General election. This process must be further strengthened and given legal teeth by the Elections Commission. Towards this end, I suggest the following measures:
1) Strengthen Paffrel pre-interview criteria with following additional criteria.
i) The applicant should have at least 2 passes in GCE (A/Level) in not more than 3 sittings. (It is not a tall order in the present times.)
ii) Should possess at least one added professional Qualification from a recognized Professional body. (Even a Diploma would do)
iii) Should produce at the interview, a less than one-month-old good health record certified by a Registered Medical Practitioner.
iv) Should be below 75 years of age as at the last date for Nominations.
Note: The above is not an exhaustive list and more conditions may be added to achieve the citizens objective of deriving a reasonable return on their investment by having professional politicians in the Provinces and the Parliament.
2) Under the structured interview method, numerical values shall be adduced to traits such as Multi-Lingual skills, debating ability, social integration, political, legal, general knowledge and overall suitability. Special weight should be added to women in order to place them in an electable position in the District merit list of the party to fulfill gender representation requirement. Parties may add more value categories to improve quality of selection.
3) The aforesaid sets of basic, pre-interview criteria and value categories should be published or gazetted by Elections Commission/Dept. well in advance of the date of Nominations so that parties can frame their pre-interview screening process and structured interview methods. Thereafter, parties can complete the screening and interview process; prepare their preliminary District merit lists of candidates and publish same in at least one National Newspaper in Sinhala, Tamil and English before a specified date well in advance for the public to raise any objections also before a specified date with the Elections Dept.
4) If there are valid objections conveyed by the Elections Dept. the parties should amend their lists accordingly, before submitting them on the nominations date.
5) The parties should certify the correctness of the pre-interview information to the Returning officer through an affidavit. Any immediate misinformation should allow the Returning officer to reject the name of such nominee/s or else if found later can be contested through an election petition.
By following the above method, it should be possible to erase the public opinion that the Party leader is the sole selector of candidates. On the contrary, the parties would become the best judges for selecting election candidates in District-wise merit order.
We appeal to all readers and civil activists to support this proposed system of Modern Representative Democracy to ensure a professional and a productive parliamentary system where MPs Chit system, Cross-overs, hung or unstable Parliaments would relegate into the limbo of forgotten things!

Beyond duality
In Hinduism, Arthanareeshwara means half Lord Siva and half Goddess Parvathi are depicted in one and the same figure. Arthanareeshwara statue represents the male and female characters together in one and the same statue. Most of the Hindu gods are depicted with their consorts, except certain gods. Goddess Kaniyakumari Lord Ayeappa and Lord Hanuman are always considered as individual gods without partners.
At the Arthanareeshwara statue, the statue is equally divided into two different equal figures. The right side is depicted with a male figure as Lord Siva and the left side is depicted with a female figure as Goddess Parvathi. But one Arthanareeshwara bronze statue exhibited at the National Museum Colombo is an exceptional one in nature. This statue was discovered at one of the ancient archaeological sites in Sri Lanka. It is said that it was discovered at Veragala in the Anuradhapura district in Sri Lanka
Female figure
The male and female figures are depicted in one statue but facing two different sides or views. The front view of the sculpture is depicted as a male figure (Lord Shiva) and the rear view is depicted as a female figure (Goddess Parvathi). The male and female images are portrayed together in one statue and made them face in two different views or two different directions. The male figure is made to face the front view while the female figure is made to face the rear view.
In the male Arthanareeshwara figure (Lord Siva) is depicted with a lotus bud in its right hand. And the left-hand holds a pole which resembles a sugarcane stem or a piece of bamboo. The female figure is depicted as Goddess Uma or Parvathi, the consort of Lord Siva. The left hand of this female figure (Goddess Uma or Parvathi) holds a parrot. The right hand of the female figure also holds a stem as a sugarcane stem or a piece of bamboo. Thaali the sacred Hindu marriage cord adorns the neck of the female figure.
Philosophically, Arthanareeshwara represents the male and female characters together in one and the same figure. In other words, it could be described as masculine and feminine functions and characters together in the one and the same God.
Exceptional statue
The height of the statue is estimated about 12 inches. This bronze sculpture belongs to the 6th century. It is a local and unique creation.
It is unique and exceptional statue because it reveals the extraordinary handiwork of the sculptor. So far such an exceptional Arthanareeshwara statue has not been found anywhere in the world. It is an excellent imaginative creativity of the local sculptor.
The male side of Lord Arthanareeshwara is adorned with a crown, neck ornaments and a lower waist garment. The female side of the statue is also adorned with female costumes and ornaments. The statue is fixed on a beautiful pedestal.
Another Lord Arthanareeshwara statue was discovered at Abaiyagiri Vihara, by the Cultural Triangle project in 1982. The period of this statue was estimated in between the period of 6th and 9th or century AD.
The above Arthanarishwara sculpture holds a lotus bud in its hand. The left hand is holding a pole which resembles a sugarcane pole or bamboo pole. The height of the statue is about 12 inches and it is believed that the sculpture belongs to the 6th century. This is a bronze statue. In Hinduism most of the Hindu Gods are described with their consorts.
Except certain gods like Goddess Kaniyakumari and Lord Ayeappa are always considered as individual Gods without partners. This particular sculpture was discovered from the Anuradhapura district.
In the Arthanarishwara sculpture the Lord is depicted in two different figures (front view is depicted with male figure and the rear view of the figure is depicted with female figure). That means the male and female images are together. Philosophically, it represents the male and female characters together in the one and the same statue. In other words, it could be described as masculine and feminine functions and characters together in the one and the same supreme image of the Lord.
The rear side of the male Arthanarishwara sculpture, depicts the female part. The left hand of the female figure is holding a parrot. This statue wears the wed lock cord known as the thali the sacred marriage cord. She is regarded as Goddess Uma or Parvathi the consort of Lord Siva. Normally, Arthanarishwara is always depicted in the one and the same statue by dividing the statue into two eqal portions. Such Arthanarishwara statues areunique and common.
As compared with all other Arthanarishwara sculptures all over the world, this particular sculpture discovered in ancient archaeological site of Sri Lanka is a unique and exceptional one because it reveals the extraordinary handiwork of the sculptor.
The sculpture shows the front view that represents the male figure and the rear view that represents the female figure. So far anywhere in Sri Lanka such an exceptional sculpture is not found. Still it is necessary to note that while seeing the frontview of the statue onecannotbe aware that there is another statue in the rearview.
The sculpture resembles the ancient beautiful Dravidian sculptural style. This bronze sculpture reveals Lord Arthanarishwara wearing a crafted crown, beautifully crafted neck ornaments andthe lower hip garmentsare beautifully worn with the tight pyjama and the right knee is bent.
It seems tobe a statue which is fixed witha beautiful pedestal. For Bharat Natyam similar pose like this is often adopted to depict Lord Vishnu, Lord Rama.
Brief, remarks, discussion/analysis and conclusion - In Bharat Natyam Thiryajtam foot position is adopted for this pose. The male figures left hand is holding a lotus bud and the two upper arms are decorated with wangi which is another ornament generally used for the arms in dance. The foot position, Thiry ajtam foot position is often used by the Bharat Natyam dancer to depict different stands of different Gods. Ornaments and the costume pattern resemble the present day Bharat Natyam ornaments and costumes.

Following two back to back 5-0 whitewashes
Chief selector summons coaching staff for pow wow
ABU DHABI, Tuesday: Sri Lanka will be hoping for a change of fortunes when they take on Pakistan in the shortest format of the game T20 International in three matches starting Thursday at Abu Dhabi.
Sri Lanka will play the first two matches back to back before they leave on Saturday for the third and final match which is scheduled to be played at Lahore on Sunday.
The most important thing is though the T20 squad that has been selected for the series is an inexperienced one they have been very energetic and want to prove something, which is a very good thing, said cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha.
The T20 squad of 16 held practice under new captain Thisara Perera at the Dubai International Stadium yesterday and was due to travel last night to Abu Dhabi.
Gurusinha said that ten players from the ODI side who did not go to Lahore and was not selected for the T20I series were due to leave for Colombo last night.
Gurusinha also stated that the support staff would stay back for the T20I matches although head coach Nic Pothas and physiotherapist Nirmalan Dhanabalasingham have indicated that they were not travelling to Lahore.
I have not heard anything so far from Sri Lanka Cricket so far so the support staff will stay with the team, said Gurusinha.
Following two disastrous back to back 5-0 series defeats at the hands of India and Pakistan, Gurusinha said that chief selector Graeme Labrooy has summoned a meeting with the teams coaching staff to find out where thing have gone wrong for the team in one-day fifty overs cricket where the batsmen have totally let the side down on both occasions.
The Lankan team will be in Lahore only for 24 hours and they are due to return to Colombo on Monday.
We really need to sit down and get back to the drawing board and find out where it has all gone wrong. The batsmen have been repeating the same mistakes over and over again in the series. You have to give credit to Pakistan the way they bowled but 103 was not a score to get on that batting wicket in Sharjah, said Gurusinha.
We dropped (Niroshan) Dickwella down the order because he can play spin very well and it was an area where we were losing wickets in the middle regularly but he was already in the centre by the third over, so the plan didnt work, he said.

CIM SL hosts Talking Point  programme on brand relevance
The Chartered Institute of Marketing Sri Lanka concluded its third Talking Point programme under the thought provoking topic Is Branding Losing its Relevance
The keynote speaker was Imal Fonseka, Group CEO, Fairway Holdings while the panel consisted of Makshoodh Meerasaibu, Marketing Director, Home Care, Foods and Water, Unilever Sri Lanka, Shalin Balasuriya, Co-Founder, Luxury Ayurveda Brand Spa Ceylon, and Tharanga Gunasekera, Head of Marketing and Communications, HSBC Sri Lanka, who moderated the discussions.
Attending the programme were a host of senior managers and executives keen to know how to manage and influence the personality and character of their brands for the local market.
Cautioning the audience, Fonseka said, Our approach in marketing and branding is no longer what it was. You have to re-look at what you are doing. Look at brand objectives, as a brand person, take the leadership and start seeing the future. As marketers you have what nobody else has - you represent the customer and understand the customer best. Igniting the passion is what it is all about - drive the change, create the change.
Stressing on key enablers, he noted supply chain, innovation, differentiation are vital to influence customer experience. As brand people enhance your scope and influence within the enterprise and that way your role will be more relevant in the future.
Urging participants on the importance of sustainability and differentiation, he said, Your sustainability and success will be based on your ability to create disruption in your business model. Anyone anywhere can create a brand and succeed overnight but you need to be ahead of the curve, understand the curve and find a space to be really connected with your consumers, find ways to make it more relevant to the market.
Tharanga Gunasekera said, With todays consumers becoming web-savvy, the consumer is now more empowered. The brand is seen as a promise, relationship and an experience.
Commenting from a FMCG perspective, Makshoodh Meerasaibu said the fundamental eight principles of branding are very relevant. However, the consumer is evolving and is constantly seeking to change. He advised the audience to constantly be cautious about how to keep pace with the ever-changing demands and to know whether branding is going to communicate or is branding becoming facilitators or enablers of conversation. Shalin Balasuriya said, Attention spans and brand lifespans are getting shorter. We need to be continuously giving our consumers new experiences, tweaking their interest and that is what we do.
Balasuriya opined that branding relevance relies on transformational innovation. We keep learning from our consumers and the brand lives in the mind of the consumer. You need to engage with the customer and start connecting with peoples lifestyles so that you are relevant to your consumers, he said.
The programme concluded with a vibrant and lively question and answer session between panelists and the audience.

Be mindful of the mind
Pay mindful attention to what we wish to bear in mind to make sure the details is preserved in our long lasting memory. Interruptions such as music and television prevent you from paying the required quantity of focus on the material. Failure to concentrate will result in the details being lost and not committed to memory. One thing that has actually been verified to help preserve our memory and brain function in time is socializing. Having a strong social group and lots of communication and conversation with family and friends will help keep our memory streaming freely.
To assist ourselves remember something, do write some notes, say them aloud and keep notes arranged. When you include different functions of your body such as composing and talking with remembering something, those physical activities will assist our brain to recall more effectively. In addition, the notes function as visual memory help.
The temporal lobe provides the brain with a complete mental picture of what we see hear and feel. Language smell and hearing are processed here. This lobe detects the direction of movement and recognizes objects - particularly faces. It remembers and recalls both facts and general knowledge. It associates memory with emotion and plays a role in making moral judgment.
The temporal lobe plays an important role in understanding words and music. The temporal lobe retrieves the meaning of words to concepts to help as express ideas. When children learn to read the temporal lobe translates words shapes into sound. It stores that information. So it can recognize spoken words.
The temporal lobe is located at the base of the frontal and oriental lobe. Just above the ear and in front of the occipital lobe. A large groove called the lateral sulcus (Sylvain fissure) separates it from the two upper lobes. Each hemisphere contains a temporal lobe. Temporal lobe disturbances, particularly in the temporal-parietal junction have been linked to seeing ghosts or auras and out of body experiences.

Continuous  assistance is vital  for local industries  for sustained  economic growth
There was a period where Sri Lanka enjoyed very high production levels for most of the consumer goods produced in Sri Lanka. The era was from 1970 to 1977 where imports were curtailed to the maximum levels.
Our essentials such as milk products, grains, jams and cordials, dry fish, fish, rice and vegetables were produced locally in large quantities. I can remember many instances where the northern public garlanded the visiting Colombo VIPs made up of onions, chillies, vegetable and fruits. The cooperative movement was at an all time high with a good distribution network. Industries such as steel, salt, paddy milling, oils and fats, fisheries, palmyrah, cement, soap, chemicals and many other industries were thriving on the steady and continuous support given by the state.
Agricultural sector benefitted most, with prices of most consumer goods were at very low levels. Only adverse point was that certain consumer items were given free in limited quantities and there was a ration card for each family.
Even though certain quarters criticized the then government, the system was very helpful in bringing down the trade deficit to all time lower levels. At that time Sri Lanka increased their export levels greatly with the assuming of the chairmanship of the Non Alligned Movement. After the non alligned conference was held in Sri Lanka in 1976 we also generated foreign employment for our citizens on a greater scale in addition to an export boom in our traditional goods.
However, this favourable forex situation changed dramatically with the change of government in 1977,they relaxed all import regulations without any controls at least for the agricultural produce. The adverse effects ran into 4 vital areas and we are in this sad plight today. Firstly, the northern youth lost their livelihood with the flooding of imports into consumer markets.
Secondly, our trade deficit widened at an alarming rate and at now edging up on a near us dollars 1 billion per month with imports leading over exports in leaps and bounds. Thirdly, our national reserves falling to a level of 4 to 5 months of imports.
Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world in 1977 has foreign reserves of 30 billion us dollars now. The fourth debacle is the rapid depreciation of the rupee vis a vis most important foreign currencies. The sterling pound which was at Rs. 16 level in 1975 has now crossed the RS. 200 level. Even now we are importing a variety of unwanted consumer goods which are manufactured or cultivated in Sri Lanka.
Our government must provide ready assistance to import substituition industries if we are to reduce this trade deficit. Over us dollars 7 billion of the current trade deficit is funded by the inward remittances of Sri Lankans working abroad. Open economy was good but it should have had some controls when introduced. The depreciation of the rupee has a telling effect on our foreign loans.
A system of foreign exchange entitlement certificates known as FEECS was introduced in 1975 in the country for any person to import goods based on the level of exports effected. Imports were allowed only up to a limit of foreign currency brought to the country so that there will be a surplus of foreign currency .There were strong import control measures at that time. What we should have done was the capacity enhancement of all industries sufficient for local needs and also to improve quality and capture export markets. This aspect was totally forgotten. From a stronger forex situation, we have now sunk deep in the world forex market. Our consumers who are also the voters and politicians are totally responsible for this pathetic forex situation.
It has now come to a situation where some of our industries cannot compete with the imported goods. Consumers prefer the low price forgetting the motto buy Sri Lankan. Certain racketeers engage in smuggling activities and flood the market with lowly priced imported goods in the absence
of import duties and import taxes/levies. Even goods coming through the official channels take advantage of loopholes in systems, importing goods of foreign origin at lower costs, posing competition to the local manufacturers. Modernisation of customs and port procedures using sophisticated testing and other equipment is a must. Secondly, the naval patrols be improved with solid and productive incentive/reward schemes.
Most of the overseas manufacturers enjoy the benefits of economies of scale to produce at lower costs. It is also a known factor that the overseas industrial giants produce their outputs to suit different markets at different cost levels.
These are smart moves on their part varying factor costs to suit different markets. If we are to follow these tactics we are compelled to strengthen raw material bases in Sri Lanka and lobby for effective changes in our Labour Laws.
However, the following points also are of paramount importance in assisting our industrial sector.
1. Lowering of bank interest rates
2. Lower manufacturing taxes
3. Lower income tax rates
4. Enactment of favourable labour laws for different industries
5. Import duty concessions for new plant and machinery which would result in enhancement of net forex earnings of industries
6. Import duty concessions for raw materials and lower bank interest rates for manufacturing of high quality
Products intended for the export markets. The entire scheme should be closely monitored by Export Development Board, manufacturers banker and the customs to ensure the success of the Scheme. The trading results and statistics of the manufacturer should be also certified by the external auditors of the manufacturer in respect of schemes in both 5 and 6.
7. Increased capital allowances on new plant & machinery for new/existing industries
8. A new skilled and semi skilled labour training institute from the age of 18 for our youth.
9. Assistance from chambers of commerce, Export development board and our overseas diplomatic
Missions and trade consuls in procuring new export markets and strategic overseas partners.
10. Arranging state funded overseas visits to our top exporters to increase their annual net forex.
Earnings coming to the country.
Talking about the reduction of Domestic cost of living it would be prudent to concentrate on the following consumer products and their local manufacturers with a view of further assistance to them to lower the unit or batch cost so that the benefit could be passed onto the local consumers by way of price reductions to wholesalers and retailers. Direct selling methods by the manufacturer be also promoted avoiding the wholesalers and retailers so that cash collection cycle and the liquidity of the manufacturer will be greatly improved.
The products are Soap, Toothpaste, brushes, poultry and fish, drinking water, yoghurt and milk products, mosquito coils, biscuits, confectionary, bakery products, local butter, margarine, soft drinks, cooking gas, soya meat, noodles, shoe polish, tea, coffee infrastructure such as electricity, water and telephone, coconut and coconut products, tissue paper, toiletries, grains, petroleum products, rice and rice products, fertilizer, sugar, jams and cordials.
The consumer cost of living deals mainly with above products and items. I wish to suggest the appointment of separate private sector teams with system/financial/costing auditors with a view of finding effective ways and means of reducing the unit/batch cost of each above item and maintain stable pricing structures with regular meetings with manufacturers held on  bona fide basis to serve the consumers and also to ensure the long term stability of the manufacturers with a view of making timely factful presentations to the government to implement the decisions reached. Reduced cost of living means increased public savings and disposable income. This will create demand for capital and other goods and the cash circulation in the country will improve resulting in higher tax collections as well.
At the same time industrialists also should adhere to a good system of corporate governance which should include,
1. Reduction of workers and staff by carrying out regular work/time study exercises
2. Minimisation of waste and damages
3. Higher quality control levels
4. Avoidance of machinery breakdowns by a system of preventive maintenance
5. Maintaining optimum span of control for batches of workers/staff
6. Effective storing/distribution
7. contingency planning for all key factors and situations
8. Bulk buying and placing blanket orders for raw materials to get discounts.
9. Enhancing productivity by workable schemes of incentives for cost control
10. Cartel agreements with others in the industry for avoiding unproductive competition and for price stability and market share allocations
11. Employment of sound cash flow management techniques
12. Continuous research on production/marketing techniques of other local and overseas manufacturers
13. Seach for low cost funds for working capital and asset acquisition
14. Building of team work, job security, profit sharing and lower labour staff turnover rates
15. Compliance with all local by laws and statutory requirements
As we observe, a very high level of corporate governance is required to ensure the going concern Concept of any industrial undertaking as they are subject to sudden business climate changes at any time. A slight error may well lead the way for loss of markets and short and medium term difficulties.
Sri Lanka has many pioneering branded business establishments who have been meeting the needs of the local consumer for many decades. But with product innovations and sound business practices they have been able to meet many contingency situations and stay afloat. Some have very successfully entered the export markets also. The state should arrange a foreign line of credit for the expansion of these pioneering industries with a lengthy repayment period so that the businesses will be able to effect more exports while maintaining price stability for local markets. The industries should also practice green environment standards at all times. Fruitful CSR projects will also gain public acceptance for the product/product range.
Many years back there was an initiative from the us government to assist the private sector by way of an umbrella known as TIPS (Technology innovative for the private sector) which assisted the local firms to enhance their technological advances and innovations. We need to embark on meaningful endeavours to procure such assistance from Japan, Germany, France, UK, Italy and other developed countries mainly to stabilize the local industrial undertakings serving the Sri Lankan consumers. A two pronged strategy could be employed. Firstly, to supply the goods at a lower profit and to cater to the overseas markets at a higher profit. As a result, corporate profit levels could be maintained at all times.
Further, the MCC (millennium challenge corporation) of us a approved Sri Lanka as one of the beneficiary 16 countries many years ago and we can seek sectorial assistance to prop up different sectors in Sri Lanka with MCC assistance. From all above endeavours, the ultimate beneficiary would be the local and overseas consumers by way of good products at affordable prices.
As we know the product life cycle consists of Pre Planning and research, product launch, growth, maturity, peak, decline, obsolescence and dropout. Our industrialists should identify their present position vis a vis the evaluation of budgeted results against the actual. Corrective measures should be taken on a priority basis as any delay will cause extreme difficulties.
Product innovation, diversification and enhancing the product range is advisable only after extensive research and test results. Any difficulties in carrying out the establishment, need be informed to the employees with achieved results and seek their commitment to overturn any periodic adverse business situations. They should be assured of job security and enhanced emoluments on a group achievement basis rather than on an individual basis. Group targets be established for every stage of manufacturing process. Production, marketing, distribution, finance, human resource and other departments should be assigned with pre determined targets.
They should be rewarded on achievement of the targets. It should be a Win Win situation for workers, management and shareholders. The chambers of commerce, industrial associations and regulatory authorities should always ensure fair play, unity and continued existence of all enterprises in the industry avoiding situations of mistrust, hasty action and chaos in the entire industry.
In the alternative, only the companies with stronger financial and marketing bases will survive. Others will not survive in the long term and will be subjected to mass scale unemployment for their workers.
Any industry is associated with inherent risks. They could well be adverse weather, higher material and other factor costs, Trade union action, Security situations, Negative publicity, unfair competition, Tax implications, Entrance of new local and overseas competitors. All industries should take great precautions in arresting any situation with their available resources. It would be advisable for any industrial concern to seek a listing in the Colombo stock exchange to raise further capital by way of bonus and rights issues and long term debentures.
The industry associations are required to monitor market monopolies and dumping practices and take effective action with the state to safeguard the industry in total. Imposition of import tariffs are needed from time to time to protect the local industries. Some of our industrial companies have burnt their hands in trying to establish manufacturing plants and bases in overseas countries. It is advisable to add value to the products locally and spend money on business promotion overseas and enter the foreign markets. Market penetration also is a possible strategy with lower prices. Price discrimination and market segmentation is another possible strategy open for exporters.
For the production of capital goods in Sri Lanka, it is always advisable to seek overseas partners of repute for strategic alliances as local companies on their own are unable to find niche markets where the profit margins are high. Strategic foreign partners will bring in new technology, new overseas markets, improved and cheaper logistic chains, fresh equity, improved worker training methods.
All these new value addition measures will place any company in an unassailable corporate position with the task of local management becoming easier and simplified. However, any strategic foreign investor will look into the following salient points in addition to their associations with directors or shareholders,
1. Stability of the Sri Lankan rupee
2. Wage rates prevailing and labour laws
3. Production and other taxes
4. Political stability and country vision
5. Financial stability and goodwill of the company.
6. Foreign reserves of the country
7. Prevailing interest rates of the country
8. Opportunity cost foregone by investing in Sri Lanka
9. Availability of suitable factors of production, at optimum cost levels
10. Infrastructure facilities of the country
11. Percentage of equity for the foreign investor in the venture
12. Security concerns
13. Past performance and credibility of local partner
14. Ease of repatriation of dividends and dividend tax rate
15. Regulations of the board of investment
Since we have cleared two main barriers for our economy and export performance, namely, euro fish/fishery products ban upliftment and the procurement of GSP PLUS, we should explore all avenues to enhance our exports in the short and medium term. However, it is the net forex earnings that matter.
The forthcoming budget proposals in November need be designed in a manner to suit the local industrial sector in a material way as this sector is directly associated with cost of living, additional employment, level of public savings, savings/earnings in valuable foreign exchange and GDP growth levels.

THE CONTROVERSIAL SIR JOHN KOTELAWALA
In David Karunaratnes version of Sir Johns biography in Sinhala, the author refers to a Cabinet meeting during the first Parliament of independent Ceylon under D S Senanayake, the Prime Minister.
The veteran politician, great DS was battling with SWRD Bandaranaike the second-in-command over the successor. The cold-war was the result of grand old mans grooming of his son Dudley to take over the reins after him. However, he was particularly cautious not to confront the deputy directly knowing his (SWRDs) wit and debatable skills. He never engaged him directly at important forums but used his relative and loyal Public Works Minister, Sir John Kotelawala, the number three in the hierarchy to annoy SWRD. DS would summon Sir John prior to the commencement of a meeting and brief him on what to say if SWRD disagreed on a point in the course of the discussion.
Our man happily undertook the difficult task, of course, he had ulterior motives, that with Bandaranaikes exit, automatically he becomes next in line for the leadership, with Dudley being junior to him.
On one such occasion, while the meeting was in progress, SWRD made an opposing move to a proposal by PM on an amendment to an Act. As pre-planned Sir John got up to interrupt Bandaranaike; the latter sensed what had transpired prior to the sessions, and retorted back I, say Lionel now dont expose your stupidity and lack of knowledge man, this matter is beyond your depths, you middle school drop-out, and as SWRD appeared to continue further the grand old man realized the reference was to himself. He immediately blasted Sir John, Lionel, I say, just shut up and sit down without trying to argue with the most learned man in the Cabinet.
Sir John, the loyal nephew of DS would take his seatnever did he let down his master. DS Senanayake scrupulously went ahead with his strategySWRD was compelled to bid good-bye to the party and the government paving the way for the grand old man to promote son Dudley over Sir John who was used only as a cats paw in the process.
Even Sir John accepted commissions!
Foreign contractors, especially the Europeans willingly paid commissions to public servants and politicians even in Colonial days. Sir John represented the Dodangaslanda electorate in the first independent parliament and appointed Minister of works. The present school in Dodangaslande named after him was built by his personal funds in the early 1950s. At the opening ceremony, the villages thanked him profusely for the invaluable gift they received from Kotelawala hamu. Without blinking a wink our man turned to them and declared, Yakko, mata nemei, ara harber eka hadapu contrath karayata kiyapalla. (You better thank the contractor who built the Colombo port.) If he said no to the money somebody else would have grabbed it; so he accepted the commission and used it on his people.
Norton Bridge hydro-power station and dam construction
The cold, rainy adverse weather at Norton Bridge caused the workers to demand gum-boots, blankets and camp-cots and other facilities to protect themselves during the construction of Sri Lankas first Hydro-power station under Sir John, who was then the Minister in charge of Transport and Works. The workers staged a strike at the site, as the Chief Engineer failed to supply the equipment with funds allocated to him. Work came to a standstill causing a delay and the monsoon rains expected soon threatening the progress of work. The workers demanded a visit by the Minister to resolve the issue after several days of stoppage. The engineer sent a message to Sir John, the Minister, explaining matters and requesting his attendance at the work site at Norton Bridge.
Sir John promptly answered the call and appeared in person on the very next day, he addressed the workers and promised to supply all that they have demanded before he returned to Colombo. In a couple of days a lorry load of material, stocks of blankets, boots, and camp-cots were unloaded at the site. No passing the buck, no deceptions, no lies.
Vilified Nehru at Bandung Summit - 1955
BANDUNG in Indonesia was the venue for the first AfroAsian Conference or the Bandung Conference that took place from April 18 to 24, 1955 during Kotelawalas premiership. Twenty-nine countries participated in it with an agenda drawn up to oppose colonialism and promote economic and cultural cooperation.
Some Central and Eastern Europe States were under Communist domination. Sir John in his speech stated,
Are not these colonies as much as any of the colonial territories in Africa or Asia And if we are united in our opposition to colonialism, should it not be our duty openly to declare our opposition to Soviet colonialism as much as to Western imperialism
The silence broke, Chou En-lai the Prime Minister of China got up in apparent agitation and said that, as Ceylonese PM, Sir John had made references to Communist Colonialism, he reserved the right to make a statement on the following morning.
The moods were exciting as they walked out of the hall. Chou inquired from Sir John why he had said so, and if it was his intention to sabotage the Conference.
Nehru was even more agitated, he walked up to his counterpart too, and questioned him in an enraged tone, Why did you do that, Sir John Why did you not show me your speech before you made it
Kotelawala rejoined, Why should I Nehru, do you show me yours before you make them
 An Asian Prime Ministers Story- 1956
Sir John was Prime Minister from October 1953 to April 1956; during this relatively short period, he was very much in the news. He organised a grand welcome to Queen Elizabeth who visited the island in April 1954 with the Duke of Edinburgh. During this visit, he advised the monarch to appoint Sir Oliver Goonetilleke as Governor-General to succeed Lord Soulbury.
During his tenure, Ceylon was admitted to the United Nations in December 1955.
Although he could go on until 1957, Sir John moved for a dissolution in February 1956 and the general election was fixed for April causing a disaster for the UNP which was reduced to eight seats. Sir John retained the Dodangaslanda seat. SWRD Bandaranaike became Prime Minister.

Countrys debt burden has increased: Prof. Vitharana
Lanka Sama Samaja Party Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana said yesterday the total debt burden of the country has increased to Rs 10 trillion during the last two years.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said Sri Lankas debt repayment bill would also increased by two folds from Rs. 337.9 billion to Rs. 645.1 billion.
Although Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the debt burden would be reduced by 70 percent of the GDP by 2020 , we wonder how this can be done with such a large debt burden, he said.
This comprised a total domestic debt stock of Rs 5,666.5 billion, a Rs. 325 billion (6.1 per cent) increase, and foreign debt, a sharper Rs 451.6 billion (11.2 per cent) to Rs 4,497.4 billion increase. During our tenure, we managed to reduce the debt burden of GDP 104 percent to 70 percent of GDP. These figures have risen under the present government. With such a huge debt, how can the Prime Minister turn Sri Lanka into a developed country by 2025, he asked.
He said the Government has not given priority to adopt technology to the industrial sector. It has prioritised only to develop IT. How can Sri Lanka be an industrial hub without developing the sector, he asked.
During last three years, the country lost a tenfold of FDI.
The economic growth rate has also decreased to 4.3 percent while the per capita income recorded a very low.
He said the Government promised to increase the allocation for education and health when it came into power. But two percent of GDP for health and 4 percent of GDP for education still remain the same.

Countrys resources not private property: Sajith
The countrys resources are not the private property of the ruling political party. They are the common property of the public. As politicians of the ruling party, we only act as trustees of these resources, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
The Minister was addressing a meeting held to mark the distribution of housing loans under the Samata Sevana Visiri Niwasa Naya programme held under the Debarawewa Regional Gamudawa programme, recently.
We cannot claim to be their owners. But members of the previous regime acted as the sole proprietors of the countrys resources, the minister added.
Minister Premadasa said as trustees of the countrys resources, they should use State funds with frugality.
The whole country should rise to fight against corruption.
The Minister said the Government recently presented a Steering Committee report on a new constitution for public discussion. It was not a final draft as it contained conflicting ideas and proposals tabled by various stakeholders. When a new Constitution was drafted, it would offer the same pre-eminent position for Buddhism and safeguard the unitary status of the country. But opponents were trying to create discussions by alleging that the Steering Committee report was trying to destroy Buddhism and countrys unitary status.
Today, certain people entertaining dreams about becoming President and Prime Minister were performing a sinful act by trying to create discussion among the Maha Sangha saying Buddhism would be destroyed under a new Constitution.
The minister said, Today, 582 families in Debarawewa, Gemunupura, Ekamuthugama, Sandungama and Vijithapura Grama Niladhari Divisions are receiving Rs. 166.6 million as housing loans under the Visiri Niwasa Naya programme at a very easy interest of 5 percent. Out of them, 233 families will receive Rs. 400,000 each to build a house and the balance 349 families Rs. 200,000 each to complete half-built houses. More development projects will be launched in these regions.
The drinking water supply in most of these DS divisions had turned brackish. A sum of Rs. 40 million will be set apart by my ministry to solve this problem and provide pure drinking water to people especially in Gemunupura, Ekamuthugama and Sandungama DS Divisions, the minister said.

Court orders probe into Malaka entering nightclubs
The Colombo Chief Magistrates Court issued an order directing the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) to carry out an investigation over an allegation that Malaka Silva, son of former Minister Mervyn Silva, had violated a Court order by entering nightclubs, yesterday.
At a previous occasion, the Court had issued an order preventing Malaka Silva from entering nightclubs as a bail condition regarding an assault case.
The Counsel who appeared on behalf of the aggrieved party complained to Colombo Additional Magistrate Daminda Weligodapitiya that they have received information that Malaka Silva had entered nightclubs contrary to the Court order.
Accordingly, the case involving an incident where Malaka Silva had allegedly assaulted a Scottish couple at a nightclub in Colombo was fixed for March 6 by the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court, yesterday.
The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) conducting investigations into the incident, had informed the Court that they have sought the Attorney Generals advice regarding two counter cases.
At a previous occasion, the Court decided to name Scotsman James Francis Casserly as a suspect in a case where he had allegedly punched Malaka Silva in the face during the scuffle at a nightclub in Colombo 3, in 2014.
Seven suspects including Malaka Silva were arrested over an alleged assault on a Scottish couple at a nightclub in Duplication Road, Colombo 3 on October 31, 2014. Police complaints were subsequently lodged by both parties claiming they had been assaulted.
As a part of the investigation regarding the Scotsmans complaint, Police had arrested and produced in Court seven suspects including Malaka Silva. They are currently out on bail.
However, the lawyers appeared on behalf of Malaka Silva alleged that police had failed to take legal action regarding their complaint that Malaka Silva was severely assaulted by the Scotsman and even had a scratch on Malakas nose.
Taking into consideration the evidence placed before Court, the Additional Magistrate decided to name James Francis Casserly as a suspect. The magisterial inquiry into two counter cases was fixed for March 6. Jayantha Weerasinghe PC, with Counsels Asela Rekawa and Maithri Gunaratne, appeared for Malaka and other suspects. Counsel Avendra Rodrigo appeared for the Scotsman.

Creating  the coolest  artificial  coral  reef  ever!
In April 2017 this giant sculpture of a Kraken was sunk along with a WW2 era ship near the British Virgin Islands in the Caribbean Sea, as a means of starting a new coral ecosystem.
The project, titled BVI Art Reef, is the work of the NGO Unite B.V.I., along with artist group Secret Samurai Productions, social justice entrepreneurial group Maverick1000, and ocean education nonprofit Beneath the Waves.
Its envisioned that within just a short space of time the ship and artwork will attract a myriad of sea creatures. Everything from corals to sea sponges, sharks and turtles will live on, in and around the wreck, says Clive Petrovic, leader of the environmental impact assessment of the project.
It is hoped that the Kraken and the historically relevant ship it rides on will attract dive tourism to the British Virgin Islands, and encourage a new generation of people who are passionate about ocean conservation. The ship was prepared and cleaned to the highest standards to ensure safety for diving. Mirror

Deaths increasing due to human, elephant conflict
Last year marked the highest number of human and elephant deaths due to the human-elephant conflict compared to statistics since 2012, the annual report of the Wildlife Conservation Department 2016 indicated.
According to the report tabled in Parliament last week, 279 elephant deaths had been reported in the island last year, while 88 people including 11 females and four children died due to elephant attacks. Compared to 2015, the number of elephant deaths had increased by 74 and the number of human deaths had increased by 25.
Gunfire had been the cause of death of 52 elephants. A total of 47 elephants died due to hakka patas, 26 due to electrocution, six due to poisoning, 12 due to train accidents and 17 due to other accidents. The cause of death of 54 elephants is unknown while 35 elephants died due to natural causes.
The highest number of elephant attacks on humans was reported in Polonnaruwa, Eastern and Anuradhapura wildlife regions. Seventy eight people were injured due to elephant attacks last year compared to 52 in 2015. In 2016, a total of 1,320 incidents of property damages had been reported due to elephant encroachment.
In addition to distributing Thunder Flare and Serpent Flare, two types of specially designed crackers were distributed to chase away the wild animals. The Department erected 287 km of new electric fences in 2016 in an attempt to mitigate elephant depredations in agricultural and plantation areas.
The department had paid a sum of Rs 8.8 million as compensation for human deaths, Rs. 1 million as compensation for injuries and Rs. 22.2 million as compensation for property damages in 2016. It had also spent Rs. 4.4 million for capture and translocation of 16 elephants.

The Dhanapala seal
A commemorative stamp on the veteran Sinhala journalist, D B Dhanapala, was issued by the Philatelic Bureau of the Department of Posts as sponsored by the Sri Lanka Press Council. What is actually the significance of the commemorative stamp was clarified by the keynote address. The stamp was a result of the Diploma Course research assignment at the Press Council Diploma in Journalism and Media Studies.
The well-wishers of the occasion included the family members of the late journalist about whom a lot was known. How learning at home as well as in India paved the way for him to be a writer not in his mother tongue Sinhala, but English, where a Masters Degree he earned from Alahabad University, reading in English literature and classics under the guidance of learned scholars he wrote in English several books out of which the collection of pen portraits which he contributed to Daily News around late 1912 came to be printed as Among Those Present. As the book became popular, his late son Dr D B Nihalsinghe brought out the second print in 2011.
The pen portraits or profiles include those who were living at the time of writing these sketches. They mostly include the eminent social reformers, writers, painters and university dons who Dhanapala associated so closely.
Penetrative and investigative features
There are 22 such pieces. Though they are not short biographies in the strict sense of the term they could be considered as penetrative and investigative features of human interest. The pieces include personalities such as Anagarika Dharmapala, Ananda Coomaraswamy, D S Senanayake, Ediriweera Sarachchandra, G P Malalasekara, Senarat Parantavitana and Venerable Yakkaduwe Pagngnarama Thera. The value of these portraits swings up today. The modern researcher has in his possession the present contribution to an intimate sourcebook of some of the missing links. As the saying goes seeing is believing.
Dhanapala had some close links with each of them when he wrote them under the pseudonym Janus. His style of writing is sensitive and eye-opening as an observer cum narrator of events. Writing on Anagarika Dharmapala he commences as follows:
When I was about seven, I happened to be a sales boy in a boutique in a suburb of Galle. The chief salesman of the shop had some pretensions to culture. When the days work was done, and the last plank of the doorway fitted into the groove, he read to us by the suit of a bottle lamp, interesting bits out of the Sinhalese papers over and over again. In these passages from the press would occur the name Anagarika Dharmapala.
This then is jotted down as the starting point in Dhanapalas sense of awareness. He blends the experiences he felt into words sensibly creating several layers of social meanings.
He creates a sense of credibility where the fact and experience felt by him becomes an over-pervading entity. Dhanapala reveals his inner self to the point that words he utilises in the communication explore a wide sphere of experiences. This goes to the extent of making a prose writer who excels in a poetic vision.
Most forgotten factors
Running to eight printed pages, the anecdote-filled profile of Dr Ananda Coomaraswamy raised some of the most forgotten factors linked to his research into the realms of archaeology and geology both in India and Ceylon. The short but insightful vision embedded in the profiles shows the extent to which Coomaraswamy was instrumental in dispelling some of the western views on oriental theories of culture, history and mythology.
Dhanapala states the following words as a passing judgment.
He (Coomaraswamy) illustrated by a single quotation the marvellous directness and simplicity of the social ethic of which the psychology of Buddhism affords sanction and which had the great significance of the warring nations: victory breeds hatred for the conquered is unhappy. The supreme tenderness and compassion associated with the Buddha was brought out by a passage in Kuru deer Jataka where the Buddha asks: Who would willingly use harsh speech to those who have done a sinful deed.
Summing up the learned journal, Dhanpaala says: He (Ananda Coomaraswamy) thus had in his studies, be they on ethics or art, philosophy or religion, a meaningful message an implied injunction suitable for the modern western world, in which he lived most of his life.
I felt as an admirer of Professor Ediriweera Sarachchandra, the essay on him by Dhanapala covers some of the unforgettable factors pertaining to the life of a university don who was multi-faceted.
Dhanapala, the journalist who had known Sarachchandra as a graduate teacher at St Peters tries to trace the steps taken in the development of his profession up to the making of a researcher cum playwright producer of historic worth.
Most profiles of Dhanapala in this volume evoke at times a vein of sensitive humane humour.
All in all, he who paid tribute to those who were present at his time are no more. As such, the rediscovery of his writing. I feel is the greatest tribute we could pay him.

Einstein's handwritten notes sell for $1.8M

Two handwritten notes penned by Albert Einstein have been sold at auction for a combined $1.8 million -- hundreds of times their estimated sale value.
The notes written in German, which the famed physicist gave to a Tokyo courier in November 1922 in lieu of a tip, contain two aphorisms for happiness.
The first, which sold for $1.56 million, reads: "A calm and humble life will bring more happiness than the pursuit of success and the constant restlessness that comes with it," according to a translation from the auction house, the Israel-based Winner's.
The letter had a pre-sale estimated value of $5,000-$8,000.
The second, which sold for $240,000, is even more to the point: "Where there's a will, there's a way." Winner's had expected to recoup an estimated $1,000 for the one-line missive.

The notes are written on notepaper from the Imperial Hotel in Ginza, Tokyo, where Einstein was delivering a series of lectures.

He was traveling to Asia when news that he had won the Nobel Prize for Physics reached him via telegraph. Einstein was unable to attend the prize-giving in Stockholm, but received a rapturous welcome in the Japanese capital.

Capitalizing on his newfound fame, he gave the two notes to the messenger, who had delivered something to his room. Tipping is not customary in Japan.



"He told the messenger to keep them, as their future value may be much higher than a standard tip," the Winner's website recounts.

Another two typewritten letters from the scientist were sold for a combined $43,200.

The 100th anniversary of his Theory of Relativity, for which he is best known and whichfundamentally changed our understanding of the universe, was celebrated in 2015.

Estate workers addiction to rotgut, root of many problems: Minister
A large number of men and women in the estate sector are addicted to illicit liquor or rotgut and spend their hard earned money to buy it, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said.
According to Minister Seneviratne, there is no use in conducting medical camps and health clinics for them because they fall sick due to their addiction to illicit liquor. Their health gradually deteriorates. Illicit liquor causes a lot of diseases, he said.
The minister was addressing the gathering at a mobile service held in Kuruvita, recently.
Minister Seneviratne pointed out that this addiction of the estate sector people was revealed during the recent District Development Committee meeting. Special attention was paid towards the issue. The estate sector people should get rid of their addiction to illicit liquor to achieve a better living standard, he said.
A large number of people living in the Ratnapura district received various services offered by the Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry and all state institutions come under the purview of the Ministry during the mobile service.
The people were able to save their money and time without traveling to Colombo to obtain the services.

Exorcist entangled in love triangle
An exorcist, who had brought a knife stuck in his waist to threaten a Romeo who made advances on his friends girlfriend, was arrested by Dambulla Police after releasing the girl concerned and three of her other boy friends.
A team from Dambulla Police which rushed to the Dambulla bus stand following a message on the police hotline that there was a likelihood of a stabbing incident at the stand, had seen a girl and four other girls involved in a scuffle. A youth standing there had complained that another youth hiding a knife in his waist had threatened to kill him.
Police had searched the suspect youth and arrested him after finding a knife hidden in his waist. Police had taken the five other girls along with the suspect youth and subjected them to questioning.
Investigations revealed that the girl in question had been carrying on with three other boyfriends apart from her original lover. One of the other boys had sought the assistance of an exorcist running a devalaya in Kekirawa to win over the girl.
The exorcist had escorted the youth to the Dambulla bus stand promising to help him win the girls heart through exorcism. But the exorcist had dangled the knife and threatened to stab the other youth if he did not give up his intentions about the girl concerned.

GMOA objects to possible tax reduction on liquor
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has sent a letter to the President objecting the proposed tax reduction on liquor to be implemented through the 2018 Budget, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo, yesterday, he said the Finance Minister has proposed a tax reduction on liquor through the 2018 Budget proposals. He had stated that the income from tobacco and alcohol will be used to upgrade the health sector. This is a complete violation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).
According to Dr. Aluthge, the Health Ministry launched the National Policy on Alcohol in 2006 and the facts included in it under Sector 6.2 and 6.3 are aimed at minimizing the use of alcohol in the country. This budget proposal severely destroys the countrys health and reputation. It completely violates the State policy on alcohol.
Some officials who included this budget proposal had stated that the tax reduction was aimed at promoting tourism but there is no scientific proof to prove that tourists are coming to Sri Lanka to consume alcohol. They visit our country to enjoy the natural beauty, our traditional food and beverages and to enjoy our valuable cultural heritage, he added.

Gota's FR petition: Jistice Wanasundera declines
The Supreme Court yesterday re-fixed for argument, the fundamental rights petition filed by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
Supreme Court three-judge-bench headed by Justice Eva Wanasundara fixed the petition for argument for January 23.
The petition was re-fixed for argument since the Supreme Court bench was not properly constituted to hear the matter.
Justice Eva Wanasundera declined to hear the case on personal grounds. In his petition, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa sought Courts intervention to prevent his imminent arrest over several purported investigations.
On May 13, 2015 the Supreme Court issued an interim order, staying the arrest of the former Defence Secretary and granted leave to proceed in the fundamental rights petition filed by him.
However, on June 8, 2015 the Supreme Court clarified that the interim order staying the arrest of Rajapaksa will only apply for four incidents including the floating armoury incident, allegations of corruption and irregularity in the MiG 27 purchase in 2006, purported share manipulation at Lanka Hospitals and the Mihin Lanka deal. His arrest cannot be made by three respondents including the IGP, CID Director and DIG of the FCID, court was told.
However, the Supreme Court observed that this interim order would not apply for any other investigative authorities who have not been named as respondents.
Rajapaksha sought the intervention of the Supreme Court to exercise the fundamental rights jurisdiction to prevent an imminent arrest of him over pending or on the conclusion of several purported investigations by the Criminal Investigations Department, Commission to Investigate Bribery and Corruptions and the Frauds and Corruption Investigation Division (FCID) allegedly set up by an order which is ultra vires. Rajapaksa had cited 45 persons including Cabinet ministers, Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara and the Attorney General as respondents.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appeared for the petitioner. Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda appeared for the Attorney General.

A corruption case filed against former Minister and Kalutara District Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeygunawardena for the alleged unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million was yesterday re-fixed for trial by the Colombo High Court.
When the case came up before High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne, a prosecution witness gave evidence and further trial fixed for January 16.
On an earlier occasion, the High Court had overruled a preliminary objections raised by former Minister against the Bribery Commissions decision to amend the charges and decided to proceed with the trial. The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed an indictment in the Colombo High Court on two counts against former Minister Rohitha Abeygunawardena for the unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million.
In his indictment, the Director General of the Bribery Commission alleged that the former Minister had committed the offence by undeclaring assets in between 2004 to 2006.
The Director General alleged that the former Minister had unlawfully made 66 monitory transactions, constructed a house and purchased a jeep in contravention to the section 23(a) of the Bribery Act. President's Counsel Kalinga Indatissa with Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for the accused.

Honouring an icon
The Pallekelle International Cricket Stadium is to be named after cricketing great Muttiah Muralitharan, it was reported yesterday in our Sports pages. The stadium was originally christened after the world Test wicket record holder, but, for mysterious reasons, the name disappeared, soon thereafter, to the great anguish of the cricket fans of Kandy. In fact, the father of Murali even brought this to the attention of the Mahanayakes, recently, and pleaded to move on behalf of his son, to have the name restored. In the end, though, saner counsel appears to have prevailed and due recognition accorded to one of the great sons of mother Lanka.
Sri Lanka has few achievements to boast of in international sports. Only Duncan White and Susanthika Jayasinghe has achieved something of note for which we could be justly proud of. In that context, Murali's world record breaking feat is certainly a standout, particularly given its enduring nature. Hence, naming an international cricket venue after him cannot, but be, amply justified. The President, the Sports Minister and all those who moved in the matter should be commended for the recognition bestowed on the Lankan star who brought fame and glory to the country through his deeds on the cricket field.
Of course, there will be many cricket lovers who will argue that much more needs to be done to honour the only bowler in Test cricket history to capture 800 Test scalps, than mere naming of a cricket venue after the legend. This is because the record is definitely going to stand the test of time and it will be eons before any bowler will come even close to achieving the target. Murali, though, is firmly installed in cricket's Hall of Fame and nothing can be too big for him now. But we are certain that he will appreciate this gesture from his fellow countrymen for the service rendered to place the nation on the world sporting map.
True, there are cricketing venues named after legends of the sport, the stand out being the Sir Vivian Richards International Stadium in Antigua, named after one of most destructive batsmen the world of cricket has ever seen. But the icon that he is, Richard's batting records have already been surpassed, and, in any event, were not unattainable. Not so though Murali's. His record will not be broken. Certainly, not in our lifetime.
Murali is also unique in other ways. He acted as the binding tie between the two major communities. Not just local cricket fans, but even the general public did not wear racial blinkers in appreciating his achievements on behalf of the country. To them all, he was a Sri Lankan, and, he delivered for Sri Lanka. He succeeded in taking his cricketing prowess far afield to forge national reconciliation. At a time the country was wracked by an ethnic war Murali, weaving his magic with a cricket ball, stood as a unifying force between the communities. No cricket lover from the majority community begrudged his success over the world's leading batsmen but continued to applaud him all the way on his record breaking feats. For them, he was apey kolla who brought the masters of the game to their knees, caught up in his web of spin.
In fact, Murali achieved what no politician could, in transcending all ethnic barriers in reaching to the communities. This was amply manifested by the reception accorded to him in his hometown, in Kandy, following his single handed annihilation of England at the Fosters Oval in 2000, in the process guiding Sri Lanka to it's maiden Test victory in Old Blighty. With the possible exception of the Kandy Esala Perahera, the hill country, arguably, had not witnessed such a mass gathering to give the returning hero welcome to their local boy. The streets of Kandy were lined for miles, with enthusiastic fans, as Murali was paraded around the town, with the star bowler waving from an open vehicle.
A similar scenario was also witnessed in Galle, during his final Test appearance, where he claimed his 800th Test wicket, playing against India, at the Galle International Stadium. The entire stadium took on a carnival atmosphere for the swan song of Murali, with the venue virtually saturated with the Murali marquees and giant cutouts. The entire Galle town reverberated to firecrackers when Murali claimed, what was to be his 800th and final Test scalp, ending a monumental career that began as a schoolboy, a testimony to the love and admiration the people of Galle - the traditional Sinhala Buddhist stronghold - had for this lad from the Tamil community, at a time the war in the north was raging.
It is time that a more comprehensive reappraisal is made of Murali's feat and a more fitting tribute paid, for his contribution to the nation, not just as a champion cricketer and a cricketing ambassador, but, what is more, a binding glue of the different communities.

Organisations need to be adaptable, honing their organization and processes to the environment.
A strategic orientation wherein operations, boundaries, vendors and markets are understood as they change is an integral part of adaptability. Yet there are givens within an organization its values and the institutionalization of what is functional. This implies that change has to be consciously managed. Therefore, Top managers perspectives become important in transforming organisations.
This programme will bring insights from case studies of successful transformations covering various dimensions of strategy including operations, and how leaders can bring about the transformation of organisations for high performance. Programme Highlights include: Perspectives on the key forces of change in the current economic and social environment, The idea of strategy and strategic change, Organizational processes, Orientation for growth and high performance, Emerging economics and rapid growth, Organizational leadership and change management.

International intervention in constitution making unnecessary: Kenyan expert
Kenyan academic on constitutions and former Chairman of the Constitution of Kenya Review Commission, Yash Ghai said pressure exerted by UN bodies and the West on countries involved in constitution making to have them settle on some sort of agreement, quick results in the relevant constitution not being viable for long or being accepted by the people.
This sort of intervention is unnecessary. Let the people get on with their tasks, let them fight, let them define their differences and let them deal with it. Foreign intervention often is not a very good thing, he said delivering a lecture on Mediating Political Compromises through the Constitution at the International Centre for Ethnic Studies on Monday (23) evening.
Ghai who has experience in advising over 20 countries on their constitutions pointed out that Constitutions have the habit of attracting other groups and people, and is often not completely national. The UN which gets in there quickly, he pointed out, even had a division within its office in New York devoted to sending experts to other countries to solve their problems.
Citing Iraq as an example, he stated that American intervention in the process simply complicated things and lengthy negotiations between the Sunni groups and the ruling majority fell apart due to the Bush Administration wanting the process expedited due to mid-term elections in the US.
The Kenyan Constitution which Ghai was greatly involved in, had taken 15 years from the time of it first being negotiated to the final day of adoption in August 2010. He explained that while it had various phases, the greatest challenge was in having political parties accepting the structure and nature of the state.
Emphasis shifts from value and principles to structure of systems and electoral systems, said Ghai as he pointed out that it was easy to get political parties to agree on civil society priorities such as health and education but harder for them to come to a common agreement on electoral systems and nature of the state. The devolution aspect of the Kenyan Constitution too had to be implemented incrementally over the years, due to its controversial nature.
The Kenyan Constitution, however, which had reached a deadlock during its formation due to political infighting, had been resolved with the intervention of the African Union and one major political party walking out of the process.
To some extent, the differences between the parties may not be as deep as we imagine. Politicians keep on fighting endlessly and it is not about social policies, looking after the poor, or letting the market take its course, it is really about capturing the state. This is important, it is a way to amass a huge fortune and the state in developing countries is very central, he explained.
The best way to ensure the longevity of a Constitution, he said, was to have people involved in the process as much as possible. He recommended that the Constituent Assembly have the participation of civil society equally represented and not have it simply as a body of Parliamentarians. The Kenyan Constituent Assembly made up of 624 members was one third Parliamentarians and two thirds the general public.
Politicians are less willing to make compromises than other groups and when you get to more political things like structure of state and electoral system, they would come in and make settlements very difficult, said Ghai.
Getting people more involved, he said, would also ensure loyalty to the constitution and it would open up public debate on the subject,
It would also silence the bigoted minority as a large percentage generally wants an equal and fair constitution. Politicians worried about their vote are reluctant to upset things but if debate is open, they will see that extremist ideas do not have much support and important decisions can be made, said Ghai.
The constitution expert, however, warned against holding referendums on constitutions as it tended to backfire on a government, Referendum is not a good procedure for endorsement. Because people, annoyed by another issue may not vote for the critical things, he explained. France for an example, which chose to have a referendum on an EU Treaty, found the French voting against a critical Treaty because they were annoyed with the government over a completely different matter, he said.

Iraqi PM challenges Tillerson on Iran remarks
IRAQ: Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi met top US diplomat Rex Tillerson in Baghdad on Monday, challenging the secretary of state over his comments on Iranian militias in Iraq.
Tillerson, in Riyadh on Sunday, had called on Iranian militias in Iraq to go home as the fight against the Islamic State group was ending.
His comments prompted a sharp response from Baghdad.
The fighters of the Hashed al-Shaabi are Iraqis who have fought terrorism, defended their country and made sacrifices to defeat (IS), Abadi said, according to a statement from his office.
The 60,000-strong Hashed was formed in 2014 after IS seized swathes of northern Iraq, routing government forces.
A coalition mostly made up of Iranian-backed militias, it has played a key role in Iraqs successful fight against the jihadists in the past three years.
The group answers to the prime ministers office and parliament has voted to integrate it into state forces.
The Hashed is an institution that depends on the Iraqi state and the constitution does not allow the presence of armed groups outside the law, Abadi said.
But experts say regular visits to Iraq by Irans Major General Qassem Soleimani, commander of its Revolutionary Guards foreign arm, the Quds Force, reflect Tehrans influence in the country.
Iraqs cabinet on Monday insisted the paramilitary forces that helped it to defeat IS were fully Iraqi.
The cabinet added that nobody has the right to interfere in Iraqi affairs.
Abadi and Tillerson both attended a landmark meeting between Saudi and Iraqi leaders in Riyadh on Sunday aimed at upgrading strategic ties between the two countries and countering Irans regional influence.
Tillerson and Abadi, in Baghdad, discussed government measures taken to restore the authority of the federal government in Kirkuk, Abadis spokesman Haydar Hamada said.
Last week, central government forces wrested back control of the disputed oil-rich province from Kurdish forces in a sweeping operation after a controversial Kurdish independence vote.
We are concerned and a bit saddened by the recent differences that have emerged between the Kurdistan Regional Government and the Iraqi central government, Tillerson said.
We are -- we have friends both in Baghdad, and we have friends in Arbil, and we encourage both parties to enter into discussion and dialogue.
The US State Department had on Friday called for Iraqi federal forces to limit their movements in areas disputed by the two sides to avoid more violence.
Both federal and Kurdish forces have been key US allies in the war against IS.
On Sunday, as calm returned to the areas in northern Iraq, federal and paramilitary forces said they lost five men in the clashes, adding to 26 deaths reported on the Kurdish side.

Its left to selectors to decide whether I remain captain - Tharanga
Monday: As captain of the one-day side Upul Tharanga said that he would take the blame for Sri Lanka 5-0 loss to Pakistan in the five-match ODI series that concluded at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Monday with Sri Lanka losing the fifth match by nine wickets.
It was Sri Lankas 12th straight loss in ODIs and at the end of the series the team had more questions than answers on how to end the dismal run that is having an overall effect on the players as a group.
From the South African series, as a team we are not settled. During the Indian series we failed to capitalize. As captain, I would like to take the blame for the defeat. All players need to take the blame, said Tharanga at the post-match press conference.
We have to score as a team. We can fail as batsmen two or three matches, but not all five games. For a team when the batters are not performing it is tough. I take the blame for the losses. The batsmen need to take a fair share of the blame as well.
We couldnt pass 200-run mark on three occasions this series. Same mistakes were repeated. Even here we had four wickets down in the first three overs and there was no coming back from thereon. The batting has been a worry in recent times and it was the same on this occasion. In the last 15 to 18 months we have struggled with our batting and that has been the main reason why we have come up with below par performances.
We had lots of discussions. We have analysed what has to be done. What we have failed to do is to deliver in the middle. In this series, from the top seven batters only two batters have passed the 75-run mark and you not going to win matches by doing that, he said.
Tharanga said that it is left to the selectors to decide whether they should continue with him as the captain of the one-day team when asked whether he would quit the captaincy.
Its the responsibility of the selectors and Sri Lanka Cricket. I dont want to leave the team and go. SLC will decide who will take the team forward.
Tharanga is one of the few players who have pulled out from travelling to Lahore to play Pakistan in the third T20I. He has been replaced by Thisara Perera as captain for the three-match series starting in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.
It was an individual decision. We chatted to 40 to 45 players and we didnt force the players to go either way. Once SLC informed us that we are playing in Lahore, we made a request to change the venue. SLC told us that they are going ahead with the game. We had a chat and we decided to give the freedom to the players to decide individually. It is the choice of the players, said Tharanga.
Personally why I opted not to go was in 2009 I was in the team although I wasnt present in Lahore that day. Just before that I was part of the ODI side that went to Lahore. After that 14 or 15 days later the shooting happened. Back of my mind the incident is there and thats why I thought not to go. But if theres an opportunity to tour in the future, I will consider. SLC chatted to us on the issue but no pressure was put on us. They understood the mental status of the players. There was no pressure whatsoever, he said.

Jaffna HC bans all forms of animal sacrifices at Kovils
Jaffna High Court Judge M.Elancheliyan yesterday banned all forms of animal sacrifices that are being practiced at Hindu kovils.
Jaffna HC Judge M.Elancheliyan delivering the judgment in a case against the annual sacrificial ceremony held at the Narasimma Kovil in Kavunawatte where several animals are sacrificed as deities to the gods, ruled that killing of animals at a pious place like Kovil where thousands of devotees worship the Gods is a punishable offence.
Legal Counsel who appeared for the continued practice of this ceremony argued that the halting of this ceremony which has been in practice for over 300 years is a dishonorable act. However,State Counsel refuted that claim stating that the practice of such primitive, barbaric rituals should be done away with as permits for the sacrifice were handed out freely by temporary, oblivious government officials.
It was also pointed out that the Butchers Ordinance does not permit the public killing or sacrifice of any animal under any circumstance nullifying the claim brought forward by the defence, that stated that the ceremony was conducted in accordance with the Butchers Ordinance.
Jaffna HC Judge M.Elancheliyan informed the Police that any individual or group in violation of the verdict was to be detained immediately and brought before court.

Kangaroo Courts, still a menace
Kangaroo Courts is a much talked about hot topic almost everywhere around the globe. It seems an alarming threat to the concept of Good Governance which is gaining ground in our soil. First of all, in order to go ahead with the good governance policy, it is discernible to me that the kangaroo courts have to be done away with from our paradise isle, there is no time like the present, for the smooth functioning of law and order for the betterment of the general public.
Since we gained independence from our colonial masters, for known and unknown reasons, kangaroo courts have been in existence and as a repercussion, most of the people who were severely battered by its adverse effects started a dialogue that the colonial masters had given top priority to law and justice prevailed in its supreme position. At this juncture in which it seems that law and order are regaining its pristine glory, little by little yet in a subtle manner, a discussion on Kangaroo Courts seems timely. After all, helping the innocent plays supreme in law.
It is a good omen that even our former chief justice is also appearing on the judicial landscape more and more frequently enlightening us on miscellaneous grounds of jurisprudence to further enlighten us on miscarriages of law pertaining to the welfare of the general public. It is high time to harness the vast wealth of experience of the legal luminary to upkeep the law which has shown its flaws and loopholes from time to time. The smooth functioning of the law of a country could assure a sound sleep to the public.
The very recent dismissal of a schoolgirl from school on the premise of possible pregnancy is definitely an eye-opener. Without accessing the relevant authorities regarding the matter, the principal and the disciplinary masters seem to have jumped into a hasty decision to dismiss the student from the school. That is where sociology of education matters. Sociological and psychological aspects of education are of paramount importance.
School system
The heads of schools and the senior teachers ought to be given a thorough understanding of the gravity of such matters. Crucial decisions shouldnt be taken according to the whims and fancies of a few. The dignity of the growing child should be taken into consideration. A student of a leading school committed suicide by shooting himself with his fathers firearm the other day. Kangaroo courts at home and schools seem to contribute negatively to the school system. The situation should be arrested without further delay. If these negative developments are allowed to take their own paths, the repercussions on the society would be calamitous.
In most of the schools, the punishments seem to be meted out without following the correct procedures. Once in a way, a few cases come into limelight because of the vigilant media. Some cases are swept under the carpet or go unnoticed. In my over four-decade teaching career, here and abroad I have witnessed many a kangaroo court in the school system.
Not only in the school system, but also in the public and private sector, kangaroo courts are rampant. Even in good old days of yore, our village headmen and other high ranking officers had had kangaroo courts. During the times of insurgencies, they had been in existence. The subject deserves to be explored even for a law degree of specialization.
The status quo related to the procedures of jurisprudence compelled me to make a further access to the concept of the Kangaroo Courts. Wikipedia came to my rescue and I would like to write a few more words in this regard as we are passing through a very remarkable period of jurisdiction in the annals of our legal history.
Legitimate judicial authority
Kangaroo is the national emblem of Australia, yet the origin of the concept could be traced back to America. In the broader sense, it is a judicial tribunal or assembly that ignores recognized standards or justice and often carries little or no official standing in the territory within which it resides.
The term may also apply to a court held by a legitimate judicial authority who intentionally disregards the courts legal or ethical obligations.
This is where the general public should keep watching whether the judgments are given with ethical authenticity. In this vein helping a known party with the vested judicial authority is undone.
The most published causes of kangaroo courts are the judicial bias of the decision maker. They could give the image of a fair trial, yet time and age prove that such actions are of kangaroo origin.
The trials of POL POT are often talked about as the verdicts had been taken before the trials began. In an inferior form of adjudication, a kangaroo court could be developed. In this sense, the smooth functioning of the rule of law is imperative to a growing nation such as our country.
One shot players could ruin the whole legal system. The court shouldnt be in someones pocket, like in the kangaroo pouch. If, in an inquiry, the evidence is intentionally ignored, a kangaroo jump is evident.
In kangaroo courts, fools rush in where angels fear to tread.

Lasantha Ranaweera and Sung Hun joint singles champs
Sri Lankas wheelchair tennis ace Lasantha Ranaweera achieved another milestone of Sri Lankas wheelchair tennis history when he emerged joint singles champion with Koreas Sung Hun in the ITF Futures Series Thailand Open Wheelchair Tennis Championship concluded in Thailand yesterday.
Ranaweera registered a comfortable first set win 6/4 over his Korean opponent in the final and was 2/5 down when the game was abandoned due to rain, where referee declared both finalists joint champions. Ranaweera beat Korean number one, Im Ho in the quarters and went on to defeat number two Korean player, Lee Ha Gel in the semis to enter the final against another Korean. Ranaweera with his team mate D.S.R. Dharmasena secured the third place in the main draw doubles event adding more value to Sri Lankas international wheelchair tennis profile.
Ranaweeras achievement ended Sri Lankas long standing title drought in Thailand Open, making him the first Lankan to clinch the singles title. Sri Lanka has been participating in this prominent regional tournament for the past 16 years and this is the highest achievement so far on Thailand soil.
Speaking to the Daily News, national wheelchair tennis coach Jagath Welikala said that these victories will surely boost confidence in our players as both Ranaweera and Dharmasena will take part in back to back tournaments, Bangkok Open Wheelchair Tennis Championship from October 26 to 28 and Malaysian Open WTC from November 30. Our players participated in ITF Series one wheelchair tournament in Belgium last July where they had the opportunity to play with some of the worlds top contenders. That highest level international exposure helped them a lot to prepare for this tournament and I hope that they will perform much better in Bangkok and Malaysian Opens. Our main focus is the forthcoming two important international events, Paralympics and World Cup qualifiers which will be held next year, Welikala revealed.

A new study now reveals that magic mushrooms could one day be used to treat depression. According to scientists, they plan to conduct a study that investigates illegal drugs ingredient, known as psilocybin, in patients with the mental health condition who have not previously responded to treatment.
If the trial is successful, the substance could be approved for treatment of depression.
The study will be conducted by the London-based start-up company Compass Pathways and will assess psilocybin in 400 depression patients who do not respond to existing treatments.
The trial will be conducted in eight European countries over three months. Digital technology will be used to determine patient response to the substance. The study's design is still subject to regulatory approval.
George Goldsmith, one of Compass Pathways' founders, said that they plan to take forward 21st century science with digital innovation and medicines now that we understand how they work, reported The Financial Times.
Experts are reportedly reassured psilocybin is safe due to the magic mushrooms' widespread recreational use.

Drama is a unique tool to explore and express human feeling. Drama is an essential form of behaviour in all cultures, it is a fundamental human activity.
A high degree of thinking, feeling and moving is involved and subsequently aids in the development of skills for all other learning within and outside of schools (transfer of learning).
Drama is a discrete skill in itself (acting, theatre, refined skill), and therefore it is offered as a 'subject' in secondary school. However Drama is also a tool which is flexible, versatile and applicable among all areas of the curriculum. Through its application as a tool in the primary classroom, Drama can be experienced by all children.
The Awards Presentation Ceremony of the State Childrens Drama Festival was held at the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre under the patronage of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S B Nawinna.

Ahikuntaka families keep on moving from place to place living in the open air. They sleep in the night inside low palm leaf makeshift huts which could be carried on the backs of donkeys when they move to another selected spot far away.
They always prefer to camp close to a water way to obtain there supply of water for drinking as well as for washing and also bathing.
These wanderers move taking their belongings on the backs of the donkeys, Their companions. Men, women, children, dogs, monkeys and Cobras which they carry in round woven boxes- especially made with safety closed lids. Ahinkuntakas always go the places where other groups camp annually.Ahinkuntakas begin their journey in the country in the wee hours of the morning to another selected place to stay for another spell. Their belief is that they always stay at a place for seven days raises a sense of curiosity in us.
After they have camped the men and women go in diverse in search of money and goods. This they do with day break. Women very often specialize in fortune reading by looking at the palm of the client who is curious to know what is in store for him according to his stars.
The readings are always impressive and captivating especially when fortunes are showered on the gullible listeners! At times a woman makes her predictions with a small bird inside a small cage placed on the ground. She gently opens the door of the cage to place a palm leaf on which writings are made. This small bird picks up a leaf of the palm leaf and then looking at the palm leaf the Ahikuntaka women goes on to describe the readings. The women describes the readings that are always impressive and captivating especially when fortunes are showered on the ears of the gullible listeners!
Ahikuntakas are familiar at village fairs where people gather to make these weekly purchases. One can observe men with this monkeys and cobras who instantly draw the attentions of the passers by.
Among this celebrations marriage ceremony takes a prominent place in this lives, On the day of the wedding huts are erected made out of palm leaves one for the bride and other for the groom close to each other.
When the time arises the woman walks out in all her finery. She wears a bright sari and jacket and is decked with silver jewelry and bead ornaments. A veil of which cloth is thrown purdah way over her head. The brides mother prepares her daughter for the wedding ceremony, She adorns her with heavy silver bangles on arms and wrists. Strings of colorful beads go round her neck and more jewelry glitters on her nose, ears and hair.
Inside this hut the bridegroom prepares to meet his bride wearing a colorful sarong. In the meantime the wise women of the bride sings sensuous love songs while preparations are made elaborately for the marriage ceremony. The nuptial knot is tied by bringing the brides and bridegrooms two little fingers together at the same time the ends of saris as tied in the presence of the relatives.
The groom harps a single leaf of betel and some areca nuts in his hands. The guests who are served liquor then begin to dance to the accompaniment of the tappu (The traditional hand drum).
The officiating elders recite hymns invoking the blessings on the newly married couple. The dowry of a donkey is made to the groom as an essential part of the life of them to carry his possessions on its back. The couple is then given a portion of the intoxicating drink and the newly wedded couple is dragged into the party of dancers. The groom with his coy bride dances to the beat of the thappu and to the tune of the snake charmers flute.
After the ceremony which lasts three hours the bride and groom are conducted to the nearby water pool in order to offer prayers and gifts to the deities, Akkuntakas believe that the waters edge is the ideal place to communicate with the supernatural, The offerings consist of a large brass vessel full of water a few betel leaves, A split coconut and a half burnt log. As the couple begin to offer prays to the deities. The guests and family members take their leave and the couple is left to themselves.

Need for tripartism on labour issues highlighted
In 1994, Sri Lanka ratified the ILO Convention 144 which is a Tripartite Consultation. As a result, the National Labour Advisory Council was established in Sri Lanka, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said.
He was addressing a workshop on 'State of labour market governance in Sri Lanka' held in Colombo, recently.
We at the Ministry of Labour at intra-ministerial meetings and at the National Labour Advisory Council as well, have discussed the need for wider consultation and true tripartism. Sometimes, we take decisions at labour dialogue forums without consulting the real beneficiaries or parties concerned, the Minister said.
On the other hand, once the decision is taken, it could be implemented. The implementation ability depends on the strength of the tripartite dialogue.
Therefore, I think recognition has to be given to the social dialogue mechanism of the country, the Minister added.
According to Minister Seneviratne, this advisory council is the national tripartite consultative mechanism, (apex body), established to provide consultation and cooperation between the Government and the organizations of workers and employers at the national level on matters relating to social and labour policies and international labour standards.
Minister Seneviratne said, since then the NLAC was established, the Ministry of Labour had taken its efforts to discuss all labour-related national issues at the NLAC and to reach consensus. But we have observed that reaching consensus among three parties is difficult and a painful exercise.

## Title: The new national food drive
## Supertitle:

The new national food drive
The government recently launched a new food drive with slogans such as atu kotu purawamu (lets fill the garners and farmyards) and cultivate every inch of crop land. Surprisingly no mention, whatsoever, was made of the toxin-free agriculture project that was so vigorously promoted by the government in the last two years under the aegis of the Presidential Secretariat and the Strategic Enterprises Management Agency (SEMA). Its leaders were the Chairman of SEMA and Ven. Athuraliya Rathana Thera.
The project which totally bypassed the formal agricultural institutions of the country such as the Department of Agriculture and the Ministry has been a total failure! This is not surprising given its objectives. Further, the glyphosate ban has taken a heavy toll on crop production and the state inaction on phosphate pollution would lead to serious repercussions in the not too distant future.
Organic farming technologies fail
Rice - toxin free or not
The main thrust of the project was the promotion of agrochemical-free (organic) agriculture and traditional rice varieties in place of the new improved, high yielding varieties. The global crop cover in organic agriculture is a meagre 1% of which two thirds is in pasture. With all effort the project could not even achieve 1% of the total rice lands in the country despite massive promotional efforts of the project because there was not enough organic matter available and two of the alternative technologies employed comprising microbial based fertilizer concoctions failed to promote crop growth and yield. One formulation, Pivithuru pohora was promoted among farmers in the Mahaweli system B and the other, Biofilm Biofertilizer (BFBF) in System C.
We met many farmers who had used Pivithuru Pohora in System B, and some of them reluctantly admitted that the fertilizer did not work. Some whispered that three or four weeks after its application, the crop turned yellow, (indicative of nitrogen deficiency) and they secretively applied urea! Secretive because they were to sell their paddy Rs. 5-7 more per kilogram than the guaranteed price as organic paddy being purchased by a powerful merchant in the area. Farmers are no fools! Trials conducted at the Aralaganwila Research Station both last Maha and Yala seasons too had not responded to this fertilizer. The other fertilizer, BFBF, prominently displayed in the SEMA website, without reliable experimental evidence as to its efficacy had been promoted among farmers in System B, by a company of which the inventor/researcher, a professor of a state institution, is a shareholder. A similar fate as for Pivithuru Pohora had befallen on this product too!
Traditional rice
The other thrust area of the toxin free project was the cultivation of traditional rice promoted over the new high yielding varieties, in the pretext that they are more nutritious and have also medicinal value. The crux of the matter is that the new varieties yield several times more than the traditional varieties and some of them have comparable nutritional value. The country moved away from the traditional varieties because they were low-yielding (average 1ton/ha), non-fertilizer responsive, lodged when fertilizer was applied and relatively more pest and disease susceptible than the new varieties which were bread against these deficiencies.
The staple food, however, is meant to provide carbohydrates or calories and other nutrition should essentially be obtained from fruits, vegetables, fish and meat. This thrust also met with little or no success. But the sale of traditional varieties is being promoted by the Toxin-Free activists. They are being sold in shops and supermarkets, but the public response has altogether been lukewarm according to the sellers because of the high price which is usually 50 to 100% more than for the usual rice.
There is however no harm in cultivating small extents if there is demand and price compensation for the farmer for the lower yields of traditional varieties. The farmers again are no fools; many of them grow a high yielding new red variety, BW 272-6b very similar to the traditional variety kurulu thuda but yields more than double the latter, and sell at double the price of normal rice varieties labelling it as kurulu thuda!
The Glyphosate ban
The writer and many other main stream scientists have over the last two years relentlessly asserted that there is no evidence to implicate glyphosate in the causation of the kidney disease (CKDu) that is plaguing the people of the Rajarata (NCP) and a few neighbouring areas. The WHO - Sri Lanka Expert Consultation that was held in April 2016 too stated in its report that there is no evidence to implicate any role for glyphosate in the aetiology of the disease. Further, a team of professionals appointed by the Prime Minister to investigate and report on the ban had reported that on available evidence the ban should be lifted. The Minister of Plantation Industries had on the basis of that report submitted a cabinet paper seeking the governments intervention to lift the ban. His concern has mainly been the serious difficulty in controlling weeds in tea in the absence of this chemical or an alternative equally efficacious.
The Planters Association has stated that weed competition has reduced tea yields and the losses last year amounted to Rs. 20 billion. However, as per the grape vine, the Minister of Health had, at some Parliamentary meeting remarked that glyphosate is a poison and the matter appears to have got stuck there! Surely, can a responsible minister make such a damning utterance without studying the matter in depth! All crops across the board use glyphosate and its unavailability have substantially increased weeding costs, especially in plantations with serious labour shortages. Nowhere else in the world has glyphosate been banned in agriculture. Despite the ban plenty of it is available locally in the black market at three to four times the normal price and farmers are using it freely. Agriculture is thus in shambles due to bad decisions!
Phosphate pollution
It is common knowledge that vegetable farmers in the Upcountry (Nuwara Eliya and Badulla Districts) apply five to ten times the recommended quantities of chemical fertilizer in the mistaken belief that more fertilizer means more crops! On top of the chemical fertilizer, farmers also add 5-10 t/ha of organic matter. Of the chemical fertilizers, the greatest concern is about phosphate derived from soluble triple superphosphate. Organic matter also may contribute to the phosphate pollution. In addition, both the organic and phosphate fertilizers carry heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd), which are toxins, as impurities in minute quantities, which, however can affect human health. There is evidence of marginal Cd build up in the vegetable soils and even in some of the vegetables grown in them, not only in the Upcountry but elsewhere too, which may in the future become a health concern.
Soil analytical evidence from the Department of Agriculture reveals that 50% of the vegetable soils in the Upcountry have phosphorus (P) levels exceeding the critical limit of 60 ppm. In some soils P levels exceeding 400 ppm have been reported. Soil scientists say that nowhere else in the world has such high soil P levels been reported. In many other countries when P levels are high, the farmers have to report them to authorities for a decision on cultivation of the land. The risk is that the P in soils exceeding the said critical level may be washed downstream entering the reservoirs in the lowlands (Rajarata) below, causing algal blooms; and some of the algae secrete toxins which can affect both the liver and kidney. In fact some researchers implicate them in the aetiology of CKDu.
If Glyphosate is a common cold, phosphate pollution is a serious cancer! Dr. Sarath Amarasiri, a former Director General of Agriculture has dealt in depth on this vital issue on many occasions in the media. Sadly, his cries have hitherto fallen on deaf ears.
In conclusion, the governments new thrust in agriculture should be based on sound policies to be decided in consultation with recognized experts in the field. It has recently appointed an economic commission to deliberate on economic issues and advise the government.
There should be a similar organisation with experts in the various fields for deliberation and advising the government on other national issues relating to development in the lines of the National Planning Commission of India. The name has been changed to the National Technology Commission under Indian Premier Modi. Matters such as the glyphosate ban or toxin  free agriculture should have been deliberated by such a body prior to implementation. Had it happened the outcome would certainly have been different.

Organic manure usage in Thihagoda increased
The Thihagoda Pradeshiya Sabha division has progressed significantly in producing organic manure.
The project initiators use a land off the Thihagoda Pradeshiya Sabha office for the purpose.
Garbage and hard waste collected in the Thihagoda and Yatiyana towns, Naduala, Naimbala and Polatugoda sub towns and other Grama Niladari divisions are brought to the land, recycled and converted into compost manure, project officials said.
Residents in the Thihagoda Pradeshiya Sabha mainly depend on cultivating paddy and other agricultural crops and they prefer compost manure to chemical fertilser for their cultivation, the officials said.
The new project help safeguard environment, the residents said.
The project has provided several direct and indirect employments.

Over million employees do not have social security coverage: Labour Minister
Sri Lanka has about 1.4 million employees without any type of social security coverage, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne said.
He was addressing a meeting held for the Ministry employees recently.
Minister Seneviratne said about eight million private sector workers should obtain EPF and ETF membership, but only 2.6 million have the membership.
The Minister said 230,000 private companies and institutions operate in the country but only 75,000 of them are inspected by the Labour Department officials. "In 2016, 7,178 private companies were registered with the EPF but the number was inadequate. Labour Officers must inspect more companies," he said.
"The labour officers should treat employees and employers equally. "Reportedly, they offered a cup of tea and a seat for an employer recently while two employees were standing outside the office. Certain officials do not follow ethics and regulation. They bring disrepute to the Labour Department, he said.

Overcome problems by upholding UN values: Kariyawasam
It is by upholding values, such as pluralism, human rights, respect for diversity and the principle of working together, upon which the United Nations was founded, that we can overcome problems the world is faced with, Foreign Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam said.
The United Nations exists and works for We the People, said Kariyawasam addressing an event to mark the 72nd UN Day at the Colombo United Nations Compound.
He said the UN has been in the forefront in drawing attention to the greatest problems faced by mankind.
It has helped lift populations across the world out of poverty. It has helped promote democracy, and make the world safer for children, women and the vulnerable. It has helped draw communities across the world closer and has helped build strong partnerships and forge greater ties, he added.
Kariyawasam said Sri Lankas relationship with the United Nations at present is the strongest it has ever been and added that Sri Lankas formal relationship with the UN turns 62 this year.
Pointing out that the United Nations is made up of We the People, Kariyawasam said even though some may believe that it is only world leaders who can make a difference, he firmly believes that each and every one of us, We the People, can do much in our individual way.
We can do a lot with determination to influence history, one step at a time by our everyday actions, by how we support a greener planet and blue ocean, through small decisions in our everyday lives, by embracing non-violence, by embracing dialogue over conflict, by promoting greater understanding among all, by recognizing the interconnected nature of all life and all things, by reaching out to other human beings who may seem different just because they speak a different language or have a different set of beliefs, but are human and that humanity unites all of us and by imparting values and principles to our children who are the most important people in our lives, he said.
Kariyawasam added that he believes that none of us as individuals are too small, too insignificant, or too weak to change things for the better.
If we are determined, we can make a positive impact. The United Nations must take the lead to create awareness among people and inspire people that we are ultimately one human family, and that we must work together for the benefit of all. We in the Government value the work of the United Nations in Sri Lanka, he said.

Pillars of  strength
Head Prefect of Zahira College Mafaz Mihular, is a man who believes in making the right choices in life and being held accountable for ones actions. Perfect Prefects features Mihular who feels that as humans we all have the potential to be so much more than what we are now.
Zahira College is a Sri Lankan leading Muslim school which inculcates with multi- cultural values of our nation according to Islamic principles. The importance of Brotherhood, Obedience, Persistence and Patriotism has molded and lead him to be the Head Boy.
Islam has had a huge influence in his life. It has taught him to be the kind of man the world places their hope and faith in.
Decision-making
The Islamic teachings I value in life are the very qualities of our beloved Prophet Muhammed such as Motivating people, Affection and sympathy to the followers , Conviction, Self esteem, Awareness of accountability, Unbiased, Swift decision making powers, Empathize with people undergoing hardships, Effective Communication and the ability to consolidate material, Executing strategy, Planning long term goals. And the scripture that I read to understand the leadership values in Islam is the one and only Holy Quran, said Mihular.
Mihular believes in being tough on crime and fighting injustice. In the world we live in many young people believe that they can do as they like and get away with it. They must be given a clear message that transgressing the law will carry its punishment. You break the rules and you try to hurt other people you will go behind bars. If you knowingly join organizations that commit violent acts you have to face the music.
No system of governance will be ideal, if punishments are not sentenced for corruptions. And the development of a country is not dependent on the system of the Government, but it depends on the attitude, Norms and values that every citizen follows, explained Mihular.
We live in a day and age when some youth do not place value on education. It is only after they miss the opportunity that they realize how foolish they have been. Education allows you to understand how the world works. It teaches you how to become a citizen of the world. How to converse with people. How to contribute to a conversation. How to be knowledgeable. It helps you understand people. It gives you control over your life. No education means no control. And no control means you are in serious trouble.
Practical life
I consider my education as a part of practical life, since it has taught me to make decisions effectively and efficiently. As a business studies student, information gathering, evaluation and time management have dramatically improved my quick decision making skills, explained Mihular
Like those before in this column, he feels that his fellow prefects are his strength. Their backing is something he counts on.
Even though Im the Head Prefect, I believe that gathering my fellow colleagues and explaining to them the real situation would result in the best possible solution ever to be made, this is my game plan, and this is my strategy, said Mihular.
Equality between the sexes is something that indicates the society is progressive. These days women have conquered all field previously male dominated.
Equal rights
From the lessons I have learned in the practical world regarding women issues and rights, some are that they should not be discriminated and should be given equal rights like Men. In this 21st century women power should be encouraged and accepted by our community, pointed out Mihular.
Mihular feels that scarcity of resources which leads to poverty, corruption and other issues make him want to stand up and do something about it. He tries to keep in mind not to waste food, time and other resources. He says that there should be Awareness Programs on Poverty alleviation, minimizing resource wastage and looking at resources which are not optimized.
Faith in his lord and faith in himself is what has enabled him to become a Leader. He believes in himself and he believes in something greater than himself.
My words to my younger brothers and sisters is Believe in yourself and have your own strategy when working on a plan. Be conceptual, and tactically implement your strategy after understanding your stakeholders. As a leader give first priority to your followers before taking decisions. Have a good bond with your stakeholders, and adapt to the changes in the Environment, stated Mihular.
Mihular also looks at other religious leaders and their philosophies when debating as to what to do when a pressure situation arises.
It makes me recall the quote of the Buddha saying With our thoughts we make the world, Being optimistic and thought preventive is the only way I calm myself. I trust on Time, because it heals everything, said Mihular .
Tower of strength
First and foremost, I would like to thank Almighty Allah. My Parents and my grandparents who were a tower of strength. Our College Principal Trizviiy Marikkar, Our vice Principal and the Master In charge of the Board of Prefects, M T A Rauf and all the other respective Vice Principals for sharing me their wisdom. My teacher Dayal Jayathilaka who taught me the practical way of life, my English teacher Meadows who played the role of a Mother in times of hardship and all the other teachers who motivated me to follow my dreams. Finally, my Board of Prefects who were behind my every success.

Protester throws Russian flags at Trump

A protester threw a handful of small Russian flags at President Donald Trump as he was walking to a lunch with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill yesterday.
The flags didn't appear to hit Trump, and in video of the moment, he and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was walking alongside Trump, did not appear to stop. 
The protester, who identified himself later to the press as Ryan Clayton, had been standing amid journalists gathered outside the meeting. 
Capitol Police swarmed him and removed him from the area. Clayton is believed to be a member of the group Americans Take Action. 
He is thought to be the same person who tried to hand a Russian flag to Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner when he appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee in July. 
Clayton was shouting about Russia, and at one point yelled, "Trump is treason!" "Why are you talking about tax cuts when you should be talking about treason" Clayton shouted at another point. 
Trump was at the Capitol for a lunch to discuss policy with Senate Republicans.

The International Centre for Ethnic Studies has organises a discussion on the Portuguese Burghers of Sri Lanka, their language, and cultural expression.
Hugo Cardoso from University of Lisbon will deliver the introductory speech on the Portuguese Burgher Community in Modern Sri Lanka. Earl Barthelot, a Representative of the Portuguese Burgher Community, will deal with the main characteristics and history of Sri Lanka Portuguese Language. Patrcia Costa from University of Lisbon will talk about Sri Lanka, Portuguese and the Portuguese Burghers. Dinali Fernando from University of Kelaniya will deliver a speech on a socio-linguistic survey of the community and revitalisation opportunities. Rui Pereira from University of Lisbon will talk about research on Burgher music and dance. The discussion will be held at the ICES Auditorium on October 31 at 3.30 pm.
The Portuguese Burghers have long been an important component of Sri Lanka's diverse human landscape. Their contributions to the culture of the island run deep. While they are and have historically been present in various parts of Sri Lanka, nowadays they concentrate mostly in the Eastern Province, where their status as a local minority often puts pressure on aspects of their distinctive culture.
This discussion is connected with the research project Documentation of Sri Lanka Portuguese, coordinated by the University of Lisbon's Centre for Linguistics, in collaboration with the International Centre for Ethnic Studies (ICES) and other institutions in Sri Lanka and abroad. The project is currently building a community-accessible archive of the Portuguese Burghers' language, music and dance traditions, as well as several other aspects of heritage and memory. The discussion will present some results and on-going activities, and reflect on the prospects for long-term cultural preservation within the context of Sri Lanka and the modern world.
The discussion will consist of brief presentations by a panel followed by a Q &A.

Russian  Revolution  remembered
In October 1917 Russian comrades who called themselves the Bolsheviks rallied around their leader Vladimir Lenin to overthrow the existing Tsar regime and establish a government of their own as Soviet Union, the worlds first self-proclaimed socialist state.
These comrades comprised of peasants, blue collar workers and soldiers. Their needs were very basic, though their determination was wholehearted. They yearned for a Just society that offers them with peace, bread and land to plough.
This great happening in the 20th century ignited by the Russian masses went into the history as the Russian Revolution, October Revolution or the Red October.
The revolution induced strength and motivation to all freedom fighters in the world.
Eventually countries such as China, Korea, Vietnam and Cuba followed the examples set by Soviet Russia to enhance the living conditions of their own people.
Centenary celebrations in Sri Lanka
October 21, 2017 marked 100 years since of the Great Russian Revolution. The centenary celebrations happened everywhere in the world and Sri Lanka was no exception.
Centenary celebrations of the Great Russian Revolution organized by The Guitar Association of Sri Lanka by means of a musical evening that took place at the Viharama Devi Open air theatre turned out to be an event for everyone to cherish.
At the dusk, matured gentlemen with their ladies were seen climbing the stairway to the open air theatre. Amongst them was an ardent leftist, former Daily News Editor Jayatilleke de Silva who translated Karl Marxs work of genius, Das Kapital into Sinhala some years back. He was escorted by his wife.
They were followed by youngsters in groups who were eager to witness an event of a rare caliber in this pleasant evening.
A cool breeze covered the open air theater as the celebrations began. Someone would have felt the souls of the comrades who sacrificed their lives at the 1917 revolution were hovering around at the time.
Kandurata Sri Lanka-Russian Friendship Societys president Athula Adhikari said, October Revolutions vibes were felt by Sri Lanka to rejuvenate its struggle for freedom from the British rule.
October Revolution induced strength to eradicate colonialism from many countries. Russians with their Red Army helped to eradicate Hitlers Nazism. Trade unionists in Sri Lanka revived their activities after the revolution, he said.
Embassy of the Russian Federation in Colombo first secretary/ Russian center for science and culture in Colombo Director, Anastasia Khokhlova gracing the occasion said the Russian Revolution happened 100 years back changed the course of human history.
Dear comrades, during the past one hundred years, countries and people have changed immensely. People hate the war now. Yet, we should learn from the lessons from history to live in the modern world. President of my country Vladimir Putin has said, We have had more than enough revolutions in the 20th century. What we need now is Evolution. So comrades, lets now think about evolution wholeheartedly. Evolution sheds light on social development and sustainability by peaceful means. This is the most important historical lesson that we derive, one hundred years after the great October Revolution, said Anastasia Khokhlova.
The musical show began afterwards with versatile artiste Amarasiri Peiris letting lose his evergreen voice. His performance was followed by dances and musical recitals.
The pioneer in Street drama, late Gamini Haththotuwegamas creation, Oba Dutuwa presented by Street Drama troupe was a touching performance.
Artistes, Ivor Denis, Sandhya Bulathsinhala, Jagath Wickramasinghe, Indra Chapa as well as The Victor Hara music band, Kandy with Ernest and Evergreen joined the bandwagon to entertain the crowd.
Young singer Lisa Abeyratnes presentation of the popular 1938 Russian Folk song, Katyusha mesmerized the crowds. The song depicts a girl named Katyusha longing for her long-lost love. Standing on a steep riverbank, she sends her song to her lovera soldier serving far away. The theme of the song is that the soldier will protect the Motherland and its people while his girl will remain true to him.
Lisa with her husky voice then sang the popular Sinhala song, Evan Paulusha originally sung by Apsara de Silva which was joined by the crowd with applause.
A cool breeze swathed the total environment that glittered with reddish lights. While the artistes took their turns on stage, faint images of comrades of the Great Russian Revolution blended with the onlookers.

The wildlife has implemented a rule to allow only 50 jeeps to enter the sanctuary from the Katugamuwa entrance and only 100 jeeps to enter from the Palatupane entrance.
Tissamaharama Police OIC Inspector Jude De Silva addressing the protesting safari jeep owners, advised them to resolve the problem peacefully through discussion with the relevant authorities. Kadirapura Safari Jeep owners Association Secretary Vasantha Vithanage said they have to pay lease installments in respect of their vehicles and a large number of youth stand to lose their jobs due to the new decision to limit entry to jeeps.
He said this had discouraged tourists from visiting Yala and the number of visitors had also dropped sharply.

Saudi crown prince promises 'a more moderate Islam'

As his country experiences the early pangs of a cultural and economic transformation, Saudi Arabia's crown prince vowed Tuesday to destroy "extremist ideologies" in a bid to return to "a more moderate Islam."
Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the moves will put the kingdom in lockstep with many other nations as it seeks to transform its economy over the coming decades.
"We want to lead normal lives, lives where our religion and our traditions translate into tolerance, so that we coexist with the world and become part of the development of the world," he said.
It's a move sure to rile the ultraconservative clerics who have held sway in the kingdom, even if that sway appears to be waning. At the same time, the prince's declaration will be heralded by Saudi Arabia's increasingly youthful population and the outside world, on whom the kingdom will rely in its quest to overhaul its finances.
"Seventy percent of the Saudi population is under the age of 30. In all honesty, we will not spend 30 years of our lives dealing with extremist ideologies. We will destroy them today and immediately," bin Salman said.
He continued, "Saudi was not like this before '79. Saudi Arabia and the entire region went through a revival after '79. ... All we're doing is going back to what we were: a moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world and to all traditions and people."
Conference attendees broke into applause.
'Righteousness is on our side'
Bin Salman's reference to 1979 was doubtless a nod to a tumultuous year for Saudi Arabia that included Shiite militants overthrowing the secular Shah of Iran and Sunni fundamentalists seizing the Masjid al-Haram, or Grand Mosque, in Mecca. That same year, the country's Shiite minority staged a deadly revolt in Al-Hasa province.
The Saudi monarchy responded by shoring up ties with the Wahhabi religious establishment and restoring many of its hardline stances. For instance, it shut down the few movie theaters in the kingdom.
Wahhabism is a form of Islam that bans the mixing of sexes in public and puts myriad restrictions on women -- among them, the requirement that they need permission from a male guardian to work or travel. Saudi Arabia's religious police were given great leeway to enforce the restrictions.
The tentacles of Wahhabism reached deeply into Saudi life, influencing its courts, politics and foreign policy, as elder kings with tight relations to the religious establishment ruled for the next few decades.
In 2015, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud took the helm, along with bin Salman, ushering in a new era of Saudi politics. The king promoted bin Salman to crown prince, making him heir apparent, in June.
The two curbed the authority of religious police, taking away their power to arrest citizens. They allowed the first music concerts in decades, cracked down on religious incitement and granted women a growing list of rights -- most notably the right to drive, which will take effect next year.
"Some clear steps were taken recently and I believe we will obliterate the remnants of extremism very soon," bin Salman said at Tuesday's conference. "I don't think this is a challenge. It reflects our values of forgiveness, righteousness and moderation. Righteousness is on our side."
The challenges ahead
Watchdog groups say Saudi Arabia has a long way to go. Weeks ago, the kingdom saidit planned to indict "radical" Twitter users who were "harming the public order."
Amnesty International,Human Rights Watchand theCommittee to Protect Journalistshave reported in recent months that the kingdom still targets peaceful activists and jails reporters, while state clerics incite hatred against the Shia minority and the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen perpetrates crimes against children.
In applauding the move to allow women to drive, Human Rights Watch's Liesl Gerntholtz told CNN last month that Saudi women still face a plethora of hardships in daily life -- namely laws that govern the guardianship of women.
"This prohibition on driving is just one in a vast series of laws and policies which prevent women from doing many things," she said. "The guardianship rule stops women from making every decision in her life without the assistance of a male relative, even if that relative is her 7-year-old son."
It's also worth noting that while the world and many in Saudi Arabia -- including the Saudi Senior Scholars Council, the kingdom's highest religious body -- commended the royal order allowing women to drive -- many Saudis took to Twitter to promote the hashtag, #The_People_Refuse_Women_Driving, as Wahhabi sheikhs predicted, "This is the end of Saudi."
Economy, culture collide
While permitting women to drive might seem like a cultural move,bin Salman also painted it as an economic onethat will bring more women into the workforce. It's no coincidence that he raised the economic aspect of pursuing a more tolerant Islam as he delivered his remarks at the investment conference in the Saudi capital on Tuesday.
The crown prince faces the daunting task of revamping the Saudi economy, and quickly. He is spearheading a reform plan called Vision 2030 that aims to wean Saudis off government aid and diversify an economy almost wholly dependent on oil.
Oil, whose prices have dropped precipitously in recent years, directly or indirectly employs roughly 70% of the population. Meanwhile, Saudis pay no taxes and receive free education, free health care and subsidies for most utilities.
In 2015, the International Monetary Fund forecast that the Saudi economy would run out of financial reserves by 2020.
The government has been able to reduce subsidies for gas and water. There is a proposal to sell a chunk of the state-owned oil company, Aramco, which could raise a substantial sum. On the flip side, efforts to cut bonuses and benefits for Saudi government officials did not pan out and the notion of taxing Saudis is a nonstarter.

Shalila Moonasinghe further remanded till November 6

Two suspects including former Litro Gas Chairman Shalila Moonasinghe who were arrested in connection with the alleged transferring of USD 1.1 million from Far Eastern International Bank of Taiwan to their personal account in Sri Lanka were ordered to be further remanded till November 6 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate, today.
Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne refused to grant bail to the suspect, taking into consideration the seriousness of the offence.
On October 6, the CID arrested the first suspect Janaka Chaminda Nammuni of Rajagiriya regarding the incident when he was attempting to withdraw Rs. 80 million from a local bank account.
The second suspect Shalila Moonasinghe was arrested on October 9, on the charge of misappropriating Rs.30 million.
According to CID reports, the Far Eastern International Bank was hacked by means of a computer virus and some US$60 million was wired to the accounts of the suspects at a Sri Lanka bank in Colombo.
The CID initiated an investigation following a complaint made by Bank of Ceylon about this fraudulent money transaction on October 6.
The Taiwanese government also took a decision to send investigators to Sri Lanka to probe the cyber money heist.
At a previous occasion, Colombo Additional Magistrate Jeyaram Trotsky issued an order to the controller of Immigration and Emigration by preventing Shalila Moonasinghe from leaving the country in connection with the Taiwan bank heist.

Speaker gets tough on Wimal's bombshell
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is to take tough action against Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa over the recent derogatory remarks cast on Parliament.
National Freedom Front Leader Weerawansa had reportedly said that Parliament has to be bombed if the proposed draft constitutional reforms receive the two thirds majority.
The Speaker said he will bring this statement to the attention of the House when it convenes again and appropriate action will be taken against the MP after an investigation.
The Speakers Media Division, issuing a press statement yesterday, noted that many Government and Opposition members brought it to the attention of the Speaker, that the above statement by MP Weerawansa was a threat to democracy and security of public representatives.
They had pointed out the threatening comment upon the Supreme Body that upholds democracy should not be taken lightly.
On August 18, 1987, Parliament came under a grenade attack and it was carried out by former JVP activist Ajith Kumara, who is supposed to be a relative of Weerawansa. Matara District Minister Keerthi Abeywickrama and Parliament official Nobert Senadeera were killed and 16 others were injured in the the bomb attack.
NFF Leader Weerawansa, who is in the forefront in the campaign against the proposed Constitutional reforms, pulled out of the Constitutional Assembly in July along with the four other MPs of his party.
However, the Speaker later announced that the withdrawal of NFF has zero impact on the Constitutional making process.

Sri Lanka heading for their longest losing ODI streak
ABU DHABI, Tuesday - By succumbing to another dismal 5-0 defeat in the five-match series against Pakistan on Monday at Sharjah, Sri Lanka extended their losing sequence to 12 matches in a row and are only three matches away from breaking their own record for the longest losing streak in One-Day International cricket which is 14.
That record took place way back in 1987 where from January 11 in Guwahati, Sri Lanka went through 14 matches without a win till January 10, 1988 in Adelaide. In that period Sri Lanka was led by Duleep Mendis in 10 matches and Ranjan Madugalle in 4. Sri Lankas defeats included an embarrassing 1987 World Cup run of six matches without a single win  the only time they have gone through such a humiliation at the mega event apart from the inaugural World Cup in 1975 where they lost all three matches.
The present run of 12 defeats started at Hambantota on July 8 against Zimbabwe and has taken place under four different captains namely Angelo Mathews (2 matches), Upul Tharanga (8), Chamara Kapugedera (1) and Lasith Malinga (1).
The home series against India which Sri Lanka lost 5-0 saw three players leading the team  Tharanga, Kapugedera and Malinga. Kapugedera took over because Tharanga was suspended for two matches during the series for slow over rate. Malinga replaced Kapugedera after one match when the latter suffered an injury.
With Sri Lanka slated to play three ODIs on their tour to India next month, the chances are that unless they win at least one match they stand a chance of beating their own record of 14 losses in a row.
If one was to consider the eight oldest full-member sides the worst record is 11 losses in a row suffered by West Indies (February 1, 2005 at Perth to August 2, 2005 at Dambulla) and England (October 27, 2000 at Lahore to June 21, 2001 at the Oval).
The world record for the most consecutive losses in ODI cricket is held by Bangladesh with 23 from 1999 to 2002. They also hold the second highest number of losses with 22 from 1986-1998.
SADEERA IN GOOD COMPANY
Sri Lankas exciting new talent 22-year-old Sadeera Samarawickrama neednt be disheartened for being dismissed for a duck in his first two innings in ODI cricket because he is in the exalted company of some of the big names who have dominated the one-day game and that includes the all-time leading run-scorer Sachin Tendulkar of India.
Tendulkar was dismissed for a second ball duck in his first two innings in ODI cricket against Pakistan at Gujranwala in 1989 and against New Zealand at Dunedin in 1990 but went onto amass a world record 18,426 runs (avg. 44.83) from 463 matches that included 49 hundreds and 96 fifties.
Another leading cricketer to suffer the same fate is one of New Zealands foremost batsman in modern day cricket Kane Williamson, the countrys captain across all formats.
Williamsons two dismissals took place at Dambulla during the Triangular Series in 2010 when he was dismissed for a nine-ball duck against India and in the next match against Sri Lanka where he was out second ball without scoring.
Williamson has since that dreadful start accumulated 4611 runs (avg. 46.57) from 115 matches with 9 hundreds and 31 fifties in ODI cricket.
Among some of the other top batters are West Indies middle order batsman Faoud Bacchus, Pakistans left-hander Asif Mujtaba, opener Mathew Sinclair of New Zealand and South African Rilee Roussouw.
Alongside Tendulkar and Williamson, Mujtaba, Sinclair and Roussouw are the only players to go and score an ODI century after bagging ducks in their first two ODI innings.
Sadeera is the third Sri Lankan cricketer to be dismissed in this manner after Susil Fernando against New Zealand in 1983 and Champaka Ramanayake against Pakistan and New Zealand in 1986.
Four players have been dismissed for ducks in each of their first three ODI innings which includes current Zimbabwe fast bowler Tinashe Panyangara who was out on all three occasions to Sri Lanka in 2004.
Sadeera could do well not to join them when he plays in his third match for his country which probably will be against India next month.
Sadeera neednt be too downcast by his two dismissals for he can draw plenty of encouragement from the likes of Tendulkar, Williamson and others to carve out a wonderful cricket career for himself in the years ahead.

Sri Lanka should  take a leaf out of  Black Caps
New Zealand are a country renowned for pace, swing and seam and not one famous against spin as history suggests and yet they came out on top to beat a leading cricket nation like India comprehensively by six wickets with an over to spare chasing down a tall target of 281 in the first of three ODIs played at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Sunday.
The manner in which Ross Taylor and Tom Latham went about their business of playing Indias well-known seam and spin attack under energy sapping hot and humid conditions battling against cramps which time and again threatened to cut short their stay at the wicket is a lesson for the Lankan batsmen to learn before they embark on the tour to India next month.
These two batsmen not the best players of spin so to say gave a fine exhibition of how to tackle the Indian seamers Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Hardik Pandya and the spin of Kuldip Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal  destroyers of Sri Lankas batting in the recently concluded series - as they put together one of the best batting displays seen on the ground with a double century partnership that sealed the match for New Zealand.
While Latham who has played the role of opener in the New Zealand side for the past two years batted at no. 5 and went onto finish the match with a magnificent unbeaten century while the experienced Taylor overcome by fatigue fell five short of a hundred when he was dismissed with New Zealand within touching distance of a win.
What stood out in the Taylor-Latham liaison was how the two batsmen were able to counter the Indian spinners by sweeps and reverse sweeps played almost to perfection taking the ball in front of their pad. Latham in particular stood out with his excellent technique and excellent execution against wrist spin. No doubt New Zealand had done their homework on the Indian bowlers before they embarked on the tour and the result was startling.
The ease with which Taylor and Latham played spin is something that the Lankan batters can learn by watching the video of this match. New Zealand were three down for 80 in the 18th over when these two batsmen came together to take the game away from India staging a terrific run chase.
It was a wonderful exhibition of how to play against wrist spin. Their footwork was excellent and they made very good use of the batting crease. By constantly rotating the strike the left-hand/right-hand combination got the Indian bowlers thinking all the time and the field also continually changing. They didnt leave it to the next batsmen to finish off the innings but ensured they were their till the finish almost as Taylor was dismissed with just one run needed to win.
For Latham who was playing in only his 59th ODI in a short career this was his 17th match in the subcontinent and his first century under these conditions whereas Taylor with 191 ODIs under his belt was playing his 47th match in the subcontinent where he has scored over 1500 runs and four centuries.
Countries like New Zealand, England and Australia think very deep before they embark on a tour especially to the subcontinent. In 2012 New Zealand employed the services of former Sri Lanka speedster Chaminda Vaas as consultant to enable their bowlers learn how to bowl on subcontinent pitches.
Vaas took 355 Test wickets of which 236 were on unresponsive subcontinent pitches and 400 ODI wickets (199 in the subcontinent). Such was the commitment of New Zealand cricket that they wanted to do well in the subcontinent. They eventually drew the two-Test series one-all.
Australia on their tour to Sri Lanka in 2016 signed up the worlds leading wicket-taker in Test and ODI cricket Muthiah Muralitharan as their spin bowling consultant. Although Australia lost the series 3-0 their intent was there for all to see.
The difference between Sri Lanka and New Zealand when they play the Indians is that the Black Caps are prepared to hit the ball not push it like the Lankan batters do.
By clearing the 30-metre field the Black Caps kept the pressure on the fielding side and found runs easy to comeby which is what the Lankan batsman failed to do against India and in the ongoing series against Pakistan.
One-day cricket is not a game for pushers and prodders but for stroke-makers. Sri Lanka who were masters at one time of that approach seems to have lost that touch and are playing as if they are novices at the one-day game.

Sri Lanka urgently needs  Dam Safety Legislations
Considering the poor state of the large number of dams in Sri Lanka, our country urgently needs a Dam Safety Regulatory Framework (DSRF) which provides the legal framework to manage all dams in the country.
Engineer Siraj Perera who is currently working as a Dam Safety Regulator in Victoria made these remarks at a high-level symposium and dialog conducted by Sri Lanka National Committee of Large Dams (SLNCOLD) in collaboration with eminent dam engineers in Sri Lanka.
Expressing views further on the subject, Engineer Perera highlighted a dire need of a Dam Safety Regulator in the country and to fulfill this obligation an independent Dam Safety Regulator should be appointed by the Government immediately.
Over 60 Sri Lankan dam safety expert engineers who were present at the symposium.
Eng. Siraj Perera also highlighted that a Dam Safety Regulator is immensely needed to a country considering the protection of lives, properties and valuable water resources and other infrastructure.
He said the Dam Safety Regulator concept is well accepted in almost all countries in the world where dams play a vital role in the development of economy.
These countries not only accepted this initiative but also enforced proper regulatory mechanism to ensure safety standards of their dams, he said.
Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources Management, Additional Secretary Eng. DD. Ariyaratne highlighted that there are many dam operators in Sri Lanka but it was pathetic that no dam safety regulations in our country.
He said dam safety standards should be followed by countrys all respected organizations in order to prevent dam failures including cascade type failures.
Director General of Irrigation, Eng. M Thuraisingham said safety practices of dam owners depend on their experience.
World Bank, Former Irrigation Engineer Nihal Fernando recalled when the Kanthale dam failed in 1986, a commission was appointed to inquire the reasons for failure and they submitted recommendations to prevent such occurrences in future.
Although they recommended that a dam safety regulation should be introduced, it did not materialize.
According to Eng. Fernando the World Bank project on Dam Safety and Water Resources Planning was launched in 2002 and the establishment of a Dam Safety Regulation was also identified but could not be implement so far.
Agrarian Development Department, Chief Engineer Prabath Withana said there are nearly 400 medium and large dams and about 12,000 small village level dams are in Sri Lanka.
All medium and large dams are maintained properly by the relevant organizations such as the Irrigation Department, Mahaweli Authority, Ceylon Electricity Board, National Water Supply and Drainage Board and also Provincial Councils.
He further said the village level small reservoirs are operated by the Agrarians Development Department, Provincial Councils and Farmer Organizations. Head works of Mahaweli Authority, Director Eng. S R K Aruppola said the reasons for conducting this nature of dialogues and symposiums are to make aware of responsible officials of the Government about the importance of this national policy.
Eng. Aruppola further said that Dam Safety Inspectorate is the one Independent Inspectors/Technical Auditors and it was initiated under MRRP/DSWRP.
He said Dam Safety legislations have been introduced in many countries.
In our country dam safety legislations and dam safety regulatory framework should have been introduced 30-years ago, soon after the breach of Kanthale Dam which claimed over 130 lives,
He said we have a choice; either to act now or keep our eyes closed and wait until another disaster like the breach of Kanthale Dam.
Therefore, a joint Cabinet Paper should be prepared by Ministers and Secretaries of all Ministries responsible, namely, Irrigation and Water Resources, Mahaweli and Power and Energy.

Steady budget implementation good for business - Exporters
The government must follow through on its budget promises in order for business to succeed in Sri Lanka, said Ramal Jasinghe, the president of the National Chamber of Exporters
He was speaking at the Sri Lanka Press Institute yesterday at the rollout of a new budget-tracking tool developed by the think tank Verite Research.
Verite found that one-third of last years budget promises are currently being implemented in some form. These include projects like improving roads in rural areas, a housing project in the North and East, and a credit scheme to encourage domestic solar power generation.
But no public information exists on over half of the promised budget items, researchers said.In exports, we make plans based on a budget, Jasinghe said. Making promises that arent followed creates expectations, he said, but undermines planning. Verite Research Executive Director Nishan de Mel said he hopes that their budget-tracking tool, which can be found online at budgetpromises.org, will help business leaders, investors, citizens, and politicians all get on the same page about public finances. The budget is not just a two-month phenomenon, said Nilangika Fernando, who helped develop the online tracker.
What we want to do is make this whole cycle something where its all transparent, where we can know whats happening with public money.
Last year, the government made 158 promises in its budget speeches, Fernando said, which amounted to almost Rs. 140,000 million allocated.
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera will present the 2018 budget on November 9.

A tripartite memorandum of understanding was signed at the Ministry of Education with affect to the launch by representatives of the respective institutions.
The SDG Action Campaign is an initiative to educate and encourage students from across the country to design and implement an SDG-based project in their communities. This campaign will support student-led initiatives towards achieving the SDGs in Sri Lanka by educating students on the SDGs, calling for project proposals and empowering 25 selected school projects across the island with seed-funding and mentoring to kick start their sustainability projects. The selected 25 school will be allocated Rs. 50,000 each.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam who graced the event and headed the discussion panel, said, Education is the key that will allow many other SDGs to be achieved. This campaign will educate and empower the youth of Sri Lanka to help the country progress. He also said that the government is dedicated to properly implement the policy to make the 13 years of school education mandatory. Such an approach will assure that no one is left behind, he added.
UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative, Sri Lanka, Una McCauley highlighted the importance of youth participation in achieving the 2030 Development Agenda.
She said, with this new action campaign, the youth in Sri Lanka will have a chance to define what Sustainable Development Goals are. We need Sri Lankas youth to be actively engaged as sustainable development leaders if we are to achieve the SDGs by 2030, McCauley further said.
This campaign will mobilize Sri Lankas youth to advocate and work towards the SDGs and in doing so, inspire their communities to work in partnership to build our future and achieve the SDGs for the prosperity of Sri Lanka, McCauley added. Speaking of the partnership and on the funding of this campaign, Hatton National Bank Chief Operating Officer Dilshan Rodrigo said, HNB has played a vital role in inculcating a savings habit among children over the years and has over 200 active school units around the country.
HNBs strategy is aligned with the national vision to improve banking penetration, develop the rural/green economy whilst reducing the informal sector.
To this end, we have been a forerunner in driving digital banking, green buildings, paperless offices congruent with UNs Sustainable development goals. We are delighted to be associated with this project as the exclusive banking partner.
The UN International Labour Organization Communication Group Chair and Country Director Simrin Singh, Education Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi, Education Ministry Additional Secretary S. U. Wijeratne and Director Education for All Badra Withanage also spoke.

Trump to name  new Fed chief soon
Donald Trump is on the verge of making a decision that will shape a big part of his economic legacy as president.
Ramping up the suspense, he has said he will name the new chair of the US central bank "very shortly".
Who he chooses for the world's most powerful economics job will influence his success at turbo-charging growth.
It comes at a key time for the bank as it moves away from emergency interest rates and the huge stimulus package sparked by the financial crisis.
The President is expected to make a decision before he flies to Asia for a major diplomatic trip on November 3.
He has hinted there are three frontrunners from a five-person shortlist. So, who is in the running
The current chair of the Federal Reserve was appointed by President Obama in 2014 and is the first woman to hold the position.
Her term expires in February. While presidents have traditionally opted to keep the Federal Reserve chair who is in charge when they take office, analysts are unsure that Trump will stick with that tradition.
In particular, they point to Yellen's perceived resistance to deregulating the financial sector as potentially putting her at odds with the White House.
The Brooklyn-born economist is seen as "dovish" - someone in favour of gradually raising interest rates. She has also been cautious about unsettling the markets as the Fed unwinds its measures from the financial crisis.
Seen as a safe pair of hands by traders, Mr Powell became the bookmakers' favourite after reports last week suggested the president was "leaning towards" choosing him as chair.
A governor on the Federal Reserve board since 2012, Mr Powell has never cast a dissenting vote on monetary policy.
"He checks all the boxes," says Omair Sharif, senior US economist at Societe Generale. He is a Republican, offers stability, backs low interest rates, and is open to deregulation of the financial sector, Mr Sharif explains.
Trump mentioned Powell as one of three possible frontrunners in an interview aired on Fox on Monday, after reports over the weekend he could be appointed along with the next name on the shortlist, John Taylor. Janet Yellen was the third person Trump named. (BBC)

Ven. Prof Abhayatissa urges political authority not to divide country
Ven. Prof Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera yesterday urged the political authority not to divide the country seeking short term political benefits, adding that the government has no mandate to divide the country and that the mandate was given to form a strong unitary State.
He was speaking at a press briefing held in Colombo at the Eliya Foundation with regard to the proposals in the interim report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly.
The devolution of power will not address the immediate concerns of ordinary Tamil people in this country. They only want to fulfill their basic needs, housing, health, education, livelihood concerns, security and other social problems faced by them, he said.
Prof. Abhayatissa Thera said all minorities in this country have the freedom of enjoying all benefits enjoyed by the Sinhalese.
Any person from the minority community has the ability to become the President, Prime Minister or hold any top positions. We never oppose such matters. But we never support any attempt to divide the country, said the Thera.
Ven. Abhayathissa Thera also charged that the government is attempting to use the word unitary to create a federal government in Sri Lanka through the new Constitution.
Addressing the occasion, former Northern Province Governor Major General G.A. Chandrasiri charged that the proposals for a new Constitution presented in Parliament has reduced the powers vested with the governors which will badly affect the country. Film Director Sudath Rohana also addressed the occasion.

West Indies beat Zimbabwe by 117 runs in First Test
BULAWAYO: Legspinner Devendra Bishoo finished with nine wickets in the match as the West Indies swept to a 117-run victory over Zimbabwe in the first Test on Tuesday.
Bishoo followed up his 5 for 79 in the first innings with figures of 4 for 105 in the second as Zimbabwe were bowled out for 316 on the fourth day at Queens Sports Club.
Although Hamilton Masakadza and Brendan Taylor struck half-centuries as Zimbabwe put up a better fight with the bat in their second innings, they were derailed by some clever bowling from Bishoo and a couple of calamitous run-outs, ensuring they were always unlikely to pull off a world-record chase of 434.
The second and final Test gets underway at the same venue on Sunday.
Zimbabwe made a bold start to their innings, with Hamilton Masakadza and Solomon Mire putting on 99 for the first wicket at a brisk rate.
But both batsmen departed in quick succession after lunch, with Masakadza caught at short leg for 57 - his first half-century in almost three years - and Mire (47) undone by some sharp reverse swing from fast bowler Kemar Roach.
Brendan Taylor and Ervine were able to absorb the pressure of a strong West Indian pace attack with a swinging ball in a steady partnership over the next hour, before Bishoo struck two critical blows. First Ervine was trapped lbw for 18 by a delivery that kept a touch low, then Williams was stumped by wicketkeeper Shane Dowrich.
Taylor reached tea unscathed on 25, while Sikandar Raza was unbeaten on two.
Zimbabwe had required just 21 deliveries to polish off the West Indian second innings at the start of day four, with the tourists adding just four runs to their overnight score of 369 for eight.
Legspinner Graeme Cremer picked up his eighth wicket in the match when he bowled Roach with the first ball of the day, before Williams denied Roston Chase a century when he bowled him for 95.

Why we need Nancy Drew right now
When I was a girl, the yellow-spined, newly expurgated Nancy Drew books were readily available and popular. But, for whatever reason, I never picked one up. And I havent seen the movies. I do have a vague memory of that dreamy Shawn Cassidy in the Hardy Boys television show, but the mystery series phenomenon largely passed me by.
Last year I happened to find a reprint of an original 1930s edition, The Secret of Red Gate Farm. On the first pages, I immediately recognized my grandmotherthey way the girls interact, their language, their sass, all familiar. But of the many surprising things I learned in my first exploration of the reprints, perhaps the very most astonishing thing, and my favorite, is that Nancy is constantly charging around in her roadster.
In the US, car ownership and driving are powerful symbols of freedom, so much so that when women in Saudi Arabia were finally granted the legal right Ato drive last month, it made headline news. But in 1930, when these first books were printed, the automobile was still relatively new, and driving wasnt quite what it is today. Just starting the vehicle was complicated and physically demanding. In the 1920s, drivers in most states were not yet required to have a license. We were still deciding on the rules.
My grandmother learned to drive in 1924, when she was fourteen. Her dad, my great-grandfather, had told her that when she had learned to change a tire and start the engine herself, hed let her get behind the wheel. She was a highly motivated girl and learned quickety-snip.
One day when the whole family was out on a long driving trip, her father thrilled her when he said she could drive thirty miles. It was a new highway, smooth driving, and there were no speed limits back then. (Imagine!) So naturally she was zip-zip-zipping along. Instead of telling her to slow down, her father quietly said, Now, Audra. At this clip, your thirty miles will be up before you know it.
My grandmother liked to recall this scene, and she recalled it often. She liked to remember the thrill, the power, the excitement so plain in her voice and face. And she liked to remember how clever her father was, too.
Now, Im no historian, but my grandmother was a storyteller. (Which is polite code for talked continuously.) She was born in 1910, and based on her many, many stories, and what I know about that time in our history, I imagine there was a brief period in the early 20th century, between suffrage and the Second World War, when women enjoyed a degree of freedom that their mothers and grandmothers may not have. Before the backlash against women in the workplace during the Second War and backlash against first wave feminism was in full swing. Before we decided on the rules.
The original Nancy Drew books were published right in that window. So when Nancy hops in her roadster charges off, something that feels so natural and obvious to usthat was a radical act, just as radical as challenging authority figures, the police and her own father.
Meeting the original Nancy as an adult, so much was striking to me, the roaster being the biggie. But I was also charmed that Nancy and her chums often use the expression psychological moment, that critical turning point in solving a case or catching a criminal. I had never heard it before, for good reason. Its long since gone out of fashion.
The term, and the rest of the girls verbal quirks, are all delightful. But as I remembered my grandmothers stories and reflected on Nancy Drew, women, and power, it occurred to me that culturally, politically, we, too, are at a hinge point, a psychological moment.
The bloody attack last May on women and girls at Ariana Grandes concert in Manchester has haunted me. This week, here in the US, were facing another attack, on womens access to birth control. These are not problems that a teen sleuth can solve, psychological moment or no. But Im grateful that there are stories that model, for girls and boys alike, young women with strength and power. Because we sure need those models right now.

Wont allow a bud to destroy SLFP - Minister Faiszer Musthapha
This countrys history has proved that no one who tried to break up a party has succeeded. This will be the fate of the Pohottuwa political Party, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party which can be compared to a giant tree cannot be destroyed by a bud. All the members of Pohottuwa are children of the SLFP. I call upon them not to commit sins by becoming traitors to their mother, Musthapha said when he opened a medical camp at Lenagala Vidyalaya on October 22.
Some individuals try to use religion to gain political mileage. Religion and religious dogma are personal. Selling religion and dogma for personal profit is not a good thing. Selling ones religion for political gain is one of the most foolish things that a person could do, Musthapha said.
The Minister said that those who oppose the opening of places of religious worship are silent when taverns are opened. In this world any person can be fed with racist ideas. However, the Sinhala Buddhist people who are well known for their sense of gratitude cannot be fed with racist ideas for narrow political gain. Musthapha also said that he has not seen any other race of people who are filled with compassion and love and the Buddhist way of life is not limited only to the Buddhists.
The Minister engaged in inspections of development projects that are taking place in the Homagama District after obtaining the blessings of the Maha Sanga at the Lenagala Rajamaha Viharaya. He then met students of Homagama Godagama Technical College and inquired into their grievances. He also declared open the Homagama Lenagala Road and Samagi Mawatha which were constructed under the 1000 Km Rural Road Development program, inspected the Kompayahena Road which is being carpeted under the allocations of the Minister and held discussions with the people of the area.
Musthapha said SLFP is no single persons property and if the Party is protected everyone is protected. This is the responsibility of all the Party members. The Marriage of the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom party is one that has occurred due to the wishes of the people and this marriage will last till 2020. However, after 2020 it is the wish of the people to usher in a SLFP government. Some persons are carrying out a campaign to split SLFP and at an Election this will be advantageous to the UNP. We will never allow the Pohottuwa Party to split the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
Rs. 15 million has been allocated to develop the Wilfred Senanayake Stadium which is in the Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha area and this Stadium was declared open by Minister Faiszer Musthapha on the request of the former Chairman Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha and the Coordinating Secretary of the Minister, Indika Koralage.
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya and Speaker and Western Provincial Council member Hector Bethamge were also present.

Worlds oldest professional  bodybuilder
Jim Arrington is in a class all his own. The 85-year-old great-grandfather was named the worlds oldest male bodybuilder by the Guinness Book of World Records for 2018 - and when it comes to passion, he is showing no signs of slowing down.
I usually exercise two to three times a week for about an hour, and its a full body workout, Arrington tells People from his home in Venice, California.
But its not a whole lot of weight - I am 85, so I cant lift the same as when I was a young buck!
The seeds of Arringtons journey were planted when he walked up to a magazine stand at a local drug store as a 13-year-old in the 1940s. While other kids looked at the comics, his eyes fell upon a book filled with pictures of bodybuilders.
They were so huge I just couldnt believe it! Arrington remembers.
Even their forearms were massive, just like Popeye. Everything else was huge, too. Back then, Arrington got sick often and couldnt run more than 15 yards without wheezing. So not long after that, Arrington used those pictures as inspiration and ordered a 25-cent booklet with exercise tutorials to begin his transformation. Exercise would keep him healthy, Arrington told himself, but it would help out in another area as well.
I decided that I was interested in girls around this time, and working out would be helpful in that department! he says.
Turns out, he liked exercising so much, that hanging with the ladies became an afterthought.
Within a few months, Arrington had put on more than 10 pounds of muscle by lifting three-pound ball bearings, and he kept going. Arrington had sparked what would become a lifelong love affair with bodybuilding that eventually led him to compete on the amateur stages of Muscle Beach and in professional settings such as the Pittsburgh Pro Masters Championships. In all, Arrington has competed in more than 60 competitions and has won 16. But during recent competitions for men aged 70 and older, Arrington says he has found himself alone on stage.
Unless someone else older than me comes along, Im sweeping the competition, Arrington says while laughing. I have small bones and I would never be able to put on the size to become Mr. America, so I guess my strategy was to outlive and outweigh everybody by waiting until everybody grew up or died!
His prize when he wins these solo competitions Well, he gets his $200 entrance fee back, Arrington says. The Herculean senior currently trains at Golds Gym in Venice, which he calls the Mecca of Bodybuilding, but he wont compete again until next August (when hell start a meticulous high-protein, high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet a month before competition).
In the meantime, he has advice for up-and-coming bodybuilders, which may ring true for just about anyone, regardless of their field.
Everyone always says theres something they have to work a little more on, and they say they arent ready yet, they tell themselves theyll compete later, Arrington says. You cant look at it that way, you need the experience - you just have to do it. People

Wrestling-themed giant  burger needs  a tag team
When you're part of a wrestling tag team, you have to be able to rely on your partner. After all, they'll need to be ready to dive in when you're flagging on the ropes, aggressively yell words of encouragement when you're caught in a headlock, and distract the ref while you sneak in a few illegal low blows against your opponent.
But what better test of a tag team could there be than pairing up to take on the challenge of a giant plate of food
Enter the Be Like No One burger, a doubly dense delicacy created by video game publisher 2K in collaboration with restaurant chain The Diner to mark the release of WWE 2K18 , the latest wrestling title in the long running sports entertainment franchise.
On one side, there are two 5oz beef patties, a slice of American cheese and burger sauce. Next to all that - in the same massive figure-of-eight brioche bun - are two buttermilk fried chicken breasts, Monterey Jack cheese, streaky bacon and coleslaw.
The whole thing is topped off with four onion rings. The Sun
