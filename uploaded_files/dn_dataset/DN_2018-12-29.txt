How the Premier Leagues top six stand at the halfway stage
LONDON, Thursday - A congested festive fixture list can often prove decisive in determining the destination of the Premier League title, but an action-packed Boxing Day also marked the halfway point of the league season with Liverpool surging into a six-point lead at the top.
Tottenham, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal have also shone at different stages of the season so far, while Ole Gunnar Solskjaers appointment as caretaker manager has even offered some hope for Manchester United after the dismal final days of Jose Mourinhos reign.
Here, AFP Sport looks at how the Premier Leagues top six have fared so far this season and what they can aspire to come May.
LIVERPOOL (1st, 51 points)
Despite manager Jurgen Klopps demands for Liverpool fans to remember it is still only December, the anticipation that their time has come after nearly three decades without a title is growing with every game.
Still unbeaten with their only dropped points coming in creditable draws with City and away to Chelsea and Arsenal, it is an incredible defensive record -- conceding just seven goals in 19 games -- that has turned Klopps side from entertainers into title contenders.
What we wanted to do all the time (was) create a situation, a basis for the rest of the season and now the first part of the season is over, said Klopp after thrashing Newcastle 4-0 on Boxing Day.
What we said as well is that we want to create our own history. We are the first Liverpool team in the Premier League to be unbeaten in 19 matches.
More history beckons for Klopp if he can be the first Liverpool manager since Kenny Dalglish in 1989-90 to win the league.
TOTTENHAM (2nd, 45 points)
No new stadium, no new signings but so far no problem as Mauricio Pochettinos burgeoning reputation as one of the worlds top coaches continues at Tottenham.
The question remains whether Spurs squad has the stamina to keep going with the demands of four competitions in the new year.
But they show no sign of slowing down having scored 11 goals in their last two games to thrash Everton and Bournemouth.
Over the last six months we havent complained about anything, said Pochettino. The one thing we have kept is the belief and being positive and we have created a bubble. We are in this position because we have worked a lot and the players really believe.
MANCHESTER CITY (3rd, 44 points)
Until mid-December, City seemed the same side that steamrollered all before them to win the title with a record 100 points last season.
But a shock run of three defeats in four games has left the champions desperately needing to beat Liverpool at home on January 3 to haul themselves back into the title race.
However, Pep Guardiola believes matching their points tally from the first half of the season will still give City a fighting chance at becoming the first team to retain the Premier League in a decade.
In a normal situation we are fighting to be champions, said Guardiola. If we make the same number of points in the second part of the season we are fighting to win the Premier League.
But the reality is there are another two teams and they are better.
CHELSEA (4th, 40 points)
Maurizio Sarris revolution of Chelseas style brought immediate results as the Blues kept pace with Liverpool and City in the early weeks of the season before three defeats in six games by Spurs, Wolves and Leicester.
Chelsea do remain well-placed to at least return to the Champions League next season in fourth, but with Olivier Giroud and Alvaro Morata failing to win Sarris trust, they could do with another striker in the January window to ease the goalscoring burden on Eden Hazard.
ARSENAL (5th, 38 points)
Unai Emery could not have asked for a tougher start to the task of replacing Arsene Wenger after 22 years in charge of the Gunners with defeats by City and Chelsea in his first two games in charge.
However, the Spaniard quickly won the confidence of the Arsenal fans as a 22-game unbeaten run in all competitions followed to propel them back into the fight for a top-four finish.
There remain some defensive deficiencies for Emery to iron out as defeat at Southampton and a 1-1 draw at Brighton on Boxing Day illustrated, but Lucas Torreira looks like the sort of tough-tackling midfielder Arsenal have been lacking for some time and they also boast the leagues top-scorer in Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.
MANCHESTER UNITED (6th, 32 points)
From the moment Mourinho started lashing out at the quality of his squad and his superiors in pre-season it seemed like he was again set to implode in his third season in charge of a big club.
By the time the axe finally fell, United were already 19 points off the top and 11 behind fourth place. Solskjaers appointment was one made with the aim of making everyone, not least their own players, remember what Manchester United once were and so far it has worked.
Far tougher tests lie ahead for the Norwegian than Cardiff and Huddersfield, but there is at long last an air of optimism around Old Trafford.-AFP

India in charge but devastating Cummins gives Australia hope
MELBOURNE, Friday - A clinical India had Australia on the ropes Friday and staring at defeat in the third Test after skittling them for 151 before a devastating spell by Pat Cummins sparked the game back into life.
At stumps, the visitors had a formidable 346 cushion with five wickets left and two days to play as they inch closer to a first ever series win Down Under. The series is currently tied at 1-1 with just the Sydney Test next week to go.
Once again the home teams batting frailties were exposed as they struggled not only with a deteriorating Melbourne pitch but outstanding bowling from young pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah.
He ended with a career-best 6-33, collecting his third five-wicket Test haul having also achieved the feat against South Africa and England.
With a 292-run first innings advantage, Indian skipper Virat Kohli could have enforced the follow on but instead opted to turn the screws and add to the imposing total.
But his batsmen also found it tough going and they slumped to 54 for five, with first innings century-maker Cheteshwar Pujara and Kohli himself sensationally out for ducks.
Cummins was Australias best bowler in Indias first innings 443-7 declared and was chief destroyer on Friday, claiming an amazing 4-3 off his first four overs.
His scalps also included opener Hanuma Vihari (13) and vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane (1).
Josh Hazlewood chipped in with the wicket of Rohit Sharma (5) with debutant Mayank Agarwal watching the carnage from the other end. He was not out 28 with Rishabh Pant on six.
None of Australias batsmen could muster more than 22, again demonstrating how much they miss the banned Steve Smith and David Warner.
Talk surrounding the pairs reintegration into the team reached a crescendo this week after Smith and Cameron Bancroft gave tell-all interviews about the South Africa ball-tampering scandal, effectively blaming Warner.
Their bans run out in late March.
In overcast conditions, Australia began the day with eight runs on the scoreboard after surviving six nervy overs on Thursday.
But with the pitch showing wear and tear, it wasnt long before the bowlers took advantage.
Aaron Finch smashed a four off Bumrah in a positive start but once again Australias limited overs captain failed as a Test opener.
He was on eight when he feebly chipped an Ishant Sharma delivery to Agarwal at short midwicket, who took a difficult diving catch.
That brought Usman Khawaja to the crease, just hours after his brother was re-arrested for allegedly breaching bail and charged with trying to influence a witness.
Arsalan Khawaja had been detained earlier this month, then bailed, after being accused of framing a love rival as the author of a terrorist hit list.
Khawaja was only at the wicket for a short time before Australias other opener Marcus Harris also fell, plunging the home team into strife at 36 for two.
Khawaja didnt last much longer, despondently trudging off for 21 after Agarwal took another catch close in off spinner Ravindra Jadeja, who was finding the rough and causing problems.
Shaun Marsh was then deceived on the last ball of the morning by some late swing from Bumrah to be plum lbw.
The afternoon didnt get any better with Travis Heads stumps knocked over by a quick Bumrah delivery and then Mitchell Marsh tickled a Jadeja ball to Rahane at slip, with the last four wickets falling for just 13 runs. - AFP

KANDY SPORTS ROUND-UP:
Kandy sports review for 2019
In two days time, another year will come to an end and it is appropriate to take a look at sports development in Kandy. Over the years Kandy has established a proud record of having produced some of the top most sportsmen/sportswomen in all fields. Successful sportsmen and sportswomen from Kandy can be proud of their achievements for the year. This was possible due to the keenness and backing they got from their parents, schools, clubs and coaches. What Kandy requires now is the backing from the Sports Minister to uplift sports at club level. Although Kandy has several sports bodies they need to get actively involved at the highest levels. Kandys urgent need is a proper ground facility. During the time when the Bogambara Stadium was under the Municipal Council, sports flourished in Kandy. The respective sports bodies were able to pocket out the ground fee, but today the ground fee is 20 times more than what it was. The sporting fraternity of Kandy hopes that the new Sports Minister Harin Fernando will focus on sports in Kandy and shower his goodies.
RUGBY - Has become the king of local club sports, as the speed and intensity of the game increases and the number of phases of play multiplies. Players tend to become somewhat oblivious to their basic roles in retaining possession and maintaining continuity of the game. Kandy Sports Club has been dominating the rugby scene for nearly two and a half decades. They have won the League, Clifford Cup and the Sevens tournaments for many years, which no other club has done so far. Kandy SC have also fed the National team with the most number of players. At present at the end of the league first round they are heading the table. Most of the schools, play the game at the highest level Trinity, Kingswood, St. Anthony's, Vidyartha, Dharmarajah, St. Sylvesters, Sri Rahula and Sri Sumangala. At rugby old boys give a big support and sponsors too come in. Tickets are priced high at matches, still fans go because for their love for the game.
CRICKET - The game of cricket takes pride of place at school level. All schools are doing well in all age groups. Sad to say, the standard of club cricket has dropped due to poor organization. Hence, the best products from schools join clubs outside Kandy. Kandy should be proud of their cricket. They have produced the best spinner in the game Muthiah Muralitharan and also a world class bat in Kumar Sangakkara. At one time cricket was one of the most popular games, and took pride of place. Today it is not so at club level.
FOOTBALL - It was at one time the most popular sport, known as the common man's game. It has sadly taken a back seat in the recent past. Kandy was once a powerhouses of Sri Lanka club football. But today it is in a forgotten state. The game is sadly neglected. For many years, tournaments and AGMs have not been held. The FFSL is not showing any interest in Kandy football. It is time they woke from their deep slumber and started to move the game of football in Kandy towards the right direction. Schools continue their football thanks to the Kandy Education Department, tournaments are held. The controlling body is blind and they do nothing to promote the game.
HOCKEY - This game has become very popular among the schools. Girl schools dominate the game in Kandy, boys schools too are somewhat on the same level. Club hockey continues, and clubs are doing their best to come back to the game. But lack of proper support from the main body of the country and no proper grounds for the game is a severe drawback.
BILLIARDS AND SNOOKER - The cue game has taken a nosedive in Kandy. There are no tournaments as in the early days. In the past there were Inter-club matches, but now it has deteriorated. In the early days, Kings Cue Club earned a name in this sport, Catholic Club at one time gave their best but now the club is no more, Lawn Club too is no more, Public Services Club members use the cue on and off, Mahanuwara YMBA is the only place where the game is promoted. Kandy YMMA, the founder members of Sri Lanka Billiards and Snooker Association who dominated cue sports at one time has ignored the game in the last ten years. Same with Kandy Garden Club. At Kandy Club visiting members play the game for fun. Peradeniya Faculty Club at one time took the game very seriously and the tournaments were a great recreation to many.
SWIMMING - It has caught up from recent times, thanks to schools, especially Mahamaya, Hillwood and Trinity who dominate the support. They have produced several top champion teams, with individual rankings at the top. Now Dharmaraja and Kingswood too are in the swim, with many more schools willing to follow if they can be helped with a pool.
BOXING - This sport remains a popular among the schools. One time kings of the ring St. Sylvester's won the Stubbs, same with Trinity the first school who took to the sport in 1906 are doing well. This time they won the T.B. Jayah event. St. Sylvesters one time boxing kings, has come back to the ring with a sterling performance and won the Stubbs Shield boxing meet after a lapse of 10 years. Other schools like Peradeniya MMV, Sarasavi Uyana, Dharmaraja, Vidyartha, Kingswood are all doing well. The first school which donned gloves, YMCA and gave a big hand at one time are also back.
NETBALL - Schools in Kandy are doing well in this sport and have taken part in most of the tournaments organized by the governing body. Girls High School, Hillwood, Mahamaya, St Anthony's Convent, Pushpadana, Swarnamali, Hemamali, Kandy Convent, and all the International schools are taking the game seriously, especially CIS, Gateway and Ecole,
ATHLETICS - All schools have athletics in the curriculum and are doing very well in this field. Every school promotes it in the correct way and have their annual inter-house athletics meet on a grand scale. They have produced some of the top athletes both at boys and girls level. They must bring back the marathon race, which was at one time was very popular.
TABLE TENNIS - In Kandy this game was very popular, but all of a sudden, it nosedived. There is some hope as there are many schools and clubs who are capable of bringing the game back to its former glory.
BADMINTON - There is somewhat a lack of interest in this sport. Something must be done to lift the game. There are not many coaches and should the schools take the cue, then the game can pick up.
VOLLEYBALL - It is the national sport of Sri Lanka but cricket has gone ahead and is the most popular sport. At a certain time volleyball was a popular game, and today the much needed support is not there for the game. If the proper backing is there, this game too, could be making the news.
IRON SPORT - Bodybuilding and Weightlifting is given the best possible support by the YMCA. It is a top sport in Kandy, hence its domination. Several national title holders have been produced.
BASKETBALL - Kandy continues to produce talented players. Most of the schools who play basketball have done well and have won many tournaments. It is the same in the club sector.
CYCLING - This sport was popular in Kandy and there had been races on many an occasion. For it to be competitive there has to be sponsorship and then the sport will spread. In the early days there was a cycle race from Kandy to Matale and back.
CHESS - Although chess has been popular in schools for quite a long period, most of the boys and girls schools are promoting it well including some International schools.
KARATE - The youngsters have done well in tournaments held in Sri Lanka and abroad. Now schools are giving a big backing for karate.
SOFTBALL CRICKET - It is very popular in Kandy. Every Sunday on or on a public holiday tournaments are organized by many individuals for various trophies. Today this is a good money making tournament.
CARROM: It is a popular sport in Kandy among schools and government departments too are taking a great interest as a recreation sport. At one time municipal community centers gave a big hand for carrom, now schools have taken over.
LAWN TENNIS - At one time it was a popular sport in Kandy. It is the Kandy Lawn Cub (now no more), Kandy Garden Club, and University of Peradeniya gave their best to the sport. Trinity and Hillwood are also involved in big way.
GOLF - Trinity College gives a big hand for golf, and they have produced some top golfers. The Victoria Golf Club located on the outskirts of Kandy is one club which has golfing tournaments and they showcase and test the golfing skills of all participants.
BASEBALL - This sport is sure to hit the top, most of the boys and girls are keen to take up the game and produce good results. The governing body should give a hand to promote the game.
MOTOR-RACING  At one time when top motor sport promoters were involved motor racing produced many events and also riders and drivers. Today the sport is there only for the name sake and they just paint the vehicles and go round the town without any competition. In the early days there were races round the lake. Even the hill climb at Wesspark, Hanthana, Digana, Kotmale are in the dark today. At one time Up-Country Motors Sports Club was the live wire for motor sports.-Country Motor Sports Clubp-Country Motor Sports Club

Kyrgios says bitten by spider ahead of Brisbane title defence
BRISBANE, Friday - Temperamental Australian star Nick Kyrgios revealed on Friday he was bitten by a spider over Christmas ahead of his defence of the Brisbane International.
The fiery 23-year-old posted a short video on his Instagram account showing him with what appeared to be a drip in his arm and being treated by medics.
This spider bite outta contro, a caption to the video said.
He added to his nearly one million followers: Got a spider bite on my foot. Christmas different every year.
Local reports said he spent the festive season in a Canberra hospital but was still on track to be in Brisbane for the tournament that starts on Monday.
Kyrgios finished his season early in October after an elbow injury forced him out of the Kremlin Cup in Moscow.
Returning home to prepare for 2019, the world number 35 admitted last month he was working through mental health issues that had plagued him throughout the year.
Im starting to see some psychologists and trying to get on top of my mental health, he said then.
The supremely talented but combustible Kyrgios has become infamous for his public outbursts and meltdowns on court.
His win in Brisbane was his only title success in 2018.  AFP

Mannar mass gravesite samples to be sent to Florida laboratory
The Office on Missing Persons (OMP) said that samples from the Mannar mass gravesite would be sent to a laboratory in Florida, USA for testing to determine the approximate time periods in which the deaths occurred.
The OMP issuing a special statement yesterday said six bone samples obtained at the mass grave located at the Sathosa Building in Mannar town were selected last week to be sent abroad for radio carbon dating.
The statement, quoting Consultant Judicial Medical Officer of Mannar District General Hospital Dr. Rajapaksha, said 278 skeletons have been unearthed so far from the excavations which commenced on May 28.
After 118 working days, we have unearthed 278 skeletons, which include remains of men, women and children. There are some damages to the bones, but it is only upon further investigation that we can determine if these are ante mortem or post mortem injuries, and whether it relates to the cause of death. Our task has been to gather evidence to determine the cause of death, time since death, the contributing circumstances and the specific identity of the individuals in this site and also determine if all the skeletons are from the same historical period or different periods, while ensuring the integrity of the site and chain of custody of remains and other evidence, Dr Rajapaksha was quoted in the statement.
Dr.Rajapaksha heads the investigation team and is assisted by Prof. Raj Somadeva, who leads the archaeological team.
Radio carbon dating calculates the amount of Carbon-14 in bone and teeth samples and establishes the approximate time when an animal or plant was alive. It is a form of testing used in archaeology and forensic science for dating human remains. The samples from the Mannar mass gravesite will be sent to a laboratory abroad, which specializes in bomb pulse carbon 14 technique. In cases where the skeletons belonged to persons that died after World War II, bomb pulse carbon 14 dating can provide a narrower range of time periods in which the deaths occurred, the statement added.
The selection of samples for radio carbon dating took place from December 18-10 under the auspices of the Mannar Magistrate T. Saravanaraja, while the OMP Commissioners Mirak Raheem and K.Venthan observed the process.
Lawyers representing families of the disappeared and a member from the Citizens Committee were also present as observers.
The team carrying out the sample selection included representatives from the Consultant Judicial Medical Officers, the Post Graduate Institute of Archaeology from the University of Kelaniya, the Police (Scene of Crime Officers  SOCO and crime investigation branch), and the Government Analysts Department.
Six samples were selected to represent the different areas and vertical layers of the site. The samples were extracted, cleaned, dried, sealed and labelled over the course of three days.
Following the samples being tested at a laboratory and the results being submitted, a preliminary combined excavation report including the test results and other findings will be submitted by the investigation team to the Magistrates Court, the statement added.
The statement also said that the OMP would provide financial assistance to carry out carbon dating as part of its continued support to the investigation.
The statement quoting OMP Chairman Saliya Pieris, stated that the OMP since July has been supporting the costs of food and lodgings of the excavation team and provided additional funds for covers to protect the grave site from the monsoon rain.

## Title: Plato knew it all!
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Saturday, December 29, 2018 - 01:00
Plato knew it all!
I want you to go on to picture the enlightenment or ignorance of our human conditions somewhat as follows. Imagine an underground chamber.... Plato's allegory of the Cave began thus in Book VII of his Republic. It could be summarized as follows. Individuals found chained to a bench, with their movement and vision restricted inside the cave. All they could see is the wall in front upon which appears shadows cast by a fire behind them. In between the fire and the wall walk actors carrying puppets on sticks. That is the world seen by these people, and they think it is the Reality. They are unable to look around or behind, so they could never see those who are creating the shadows, or what is really happening outside the cave.
We are all prisoners inside Plato's cave. We have chained ourselves to our chairs to watch the shadows playing on the screens of the television, desktops, laptops, tablets and androids. We are trapped inside a world created by the mass media and chained to a wall by the advertising mafia, so that we cannot even move our heads. We create our caves, and the chains and we tie ourselves inside the caves. We create the people who manipulate the puppets and keep us imprisoned in the cave. We pay them, directly and indirectly, for imprisoning us. We only see the images of the puppets and the echos. It is the reality for us. We accept this as the reality and discuss and debate them and try to live by them. Our eyes are so adjusted to the glowing screens that we cannot see anything beyond them.
We are living in a world of shadows, Maya. When Shakespeare saw the world as a stage, he was talking about all the men and women as actors, while today inside the world stage are many more stages where the actors are watching the shadows of other actors, and are imitating the shadow actors. In the eastern concept of Maya we are trapped in maya within the maya. Today even if we can stumble out of the cave we have built for ourselves, we will still not be able to see the reality. Outside our cave is only the shadows of a larger cave built by the society we live in.
Plato envisioned a cave where people were imprisoned. We have made the world into one big cave, imprisoning us in cyberspace. Digital technology is the monkey on our back, as we carry our own fetters and blinkers in the form of digital audio-visual equipment. Wherever we go, Satan or Mara has set up additional prisons, with telivison screens in hotel lobies, public spaces, even in cars, buses and aircrafts. There is no escape from all these evil shadows, inside or outside the cave.
Attempts to escape
Aristotle described human perception as a bat's eye view'. The Chinese Taoist philosopher Chuang-Tzu, (369 - 286 B.C.E.) had once dreamed that he was a butterfly. On awakening, he had asked himself, if he was a man dreaming that he was a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming that he was a man. St. Augustine believed that what was outside the cave was the realm of the Christian God.
Among the prisoners in Plato's cave there would have been a few who realized they were suffering. There had been attempts to escape, and go outside into the sunlight. Some of them realized the Truth and tried to go back and explain the Truth to the others, and to try to bring them out of the cave. Not many would believe them and sometimes would attack them as fools or lunatics. Others would try to fight those who held the people in chains and try to liberate them from the chains. Most of them get murdered, either by the prison guards or by the prisoners themselves, who preferred the safety of the cave. These great men who tried to free the prisoners range from Buddha, Christ and Che Guevara.
The electronic shadows have made Mammonism the universal religion. The marketing gurus are the high priests serving Mammon. Mammon has subdued all the Vedic gods, the Supreme Lord of the revealed religions, and the teachings of the Buddha and Mahavira, and the efforts of Mahathma Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda.
In the beginning, the electronic visual media would have been simple free-to-air programmes of news coverage, documentaries of cultural and educational value, broadcast by state owned non-profit institutions. It is only with the entry of the private enterprises that Mammon took over the media. The primary and even the ulterior motives of a commercial venture is Profit, and as man is always driven by greed, it became profit-at-any-cost, regardless of the effects on the society, culture, religion and unfortunately on the young generation.
The electronic shadows cause the greatest harm to young people. It affects them physically and mentally. The constant exposure to the glare of the screens affect their vision. They miss the opportunity to go out and play with their friends, and the lack of exercises affect their health. Mentally they lose the power of imagination, and they lose all interest in thinking. It is very easy for the operators of the shadows to influence the minds and bodies of the young people.
The visual advertisements exploit women, using them as sex objects and exploit children, using them in advertisements and by creating temptation for unwanted material things among the children who watch. It creates frustration not only in children but also among the parents because of things their children cannot have.
The economic cost of profit driven visual media is probably not quantifiable. The number of man-hours consumed by the people of productive age in the country is enormous. So is the power consumption, not only for the broadcast and transmission and reception, but also for domestic lighting, and air conditioning. There are households where one or more television sets are switched on 24/7.
Breakdown of communication
The social cost is the breakdown of communication within family, the neglect of the education of the children, the well-being of the children and the elders, and the neglect of the household in general. Each individual is imprisoned in his own shell, isolating him even from his family and friends. The cost of sleep deprivation due to the addiction to shadow play on television cannot be quantified either, as the cost is the effect on productivity, health and responsibilities towards the family and society. There is a medical cost too, because of the lifestyle diseases as a result of getting addicted to all the harmful food and drink promoted on television and also by consuming all such food while glued to the screen.
The original Soap Opera came to stay with us as soap makers P&G, Levers and Colgate began sponsoring radio plays, even long before the arrival of television.
Then we did not watch shadows, but we listened to the drama on the radio and used our own imagination to picture the characters and their actions, in our minds, in our own make-believe world. The shadows we see today do not leave anything to our imagination. We are also influenced by what we see, in the actions, behaviour, dress and the background.
The shadows we watch of unethical commercial advertising, both direct and embedded, targets the basic human craving for sensual satisfaction. The people in South Asia were leading a simple life of Ahimsa, co-existing with all life, practising Compassionate Consumption. They would not have coveted the neighbours wealth or their women, they would have been satisfied with what they had with no necessity for more wealth to acquire more material things or luxuries.
Before the new electronic shadow play and even the audio drama on radio, we had the good fortune to sit in the garden or on the front porch in the evening, and listen to our elders. They told us stories from the past, and their own experiences, which contributed to our knowledge of our culture, heritage and our own families. It was the received wisdom of generation. It was also more fun, listening to the stories, while watching the shadow play from an oil lamp or a fire on the wall, or on a moonlit night the shadows of the trees dancing around us.
The electronic audio media in the guise of the radio was a leap forward for the trader. With the advent of visual media and the availability of electricity even in the remotest village, added to satellite transmission was a giant leap forward. We boast of a global village. But in reality what digital technology did was take the worst traditions, practices and illusions from the city into village and make the whole world a garbage dump.
It is a weakness among human beings to imitate and follow others. Before the advent of electronic media, people could ape or follow only his neighbours or others in his immediate surroundings. But today he can follow anyone, from anywhere on earth. The visual media controls who or what we see, and make us ape or follow what they show. It affects our culture completely, what we wear, what we eat and drink, even how we speak and behave.
The disadvantages of the electronic shadow-play are many and the harm caused to man's mind and body, while destroying the culture and society is enormous. I believe it is the responsibility of the writers and poets to incite mankind, specially the young generation, to pick up the reading habit, even using the Mara's own weapons of android phones and tablets, to read. Let our society unshackle themselves and let us hope and pray that our children will never get imprisoned in Plato's cave.
Let us destroy the caves created by the business organizations, and also built by our own selves. Let us step out into the real world, to go back to nature, and to associate with our family and friends like we used to, many decades ago. Let us defeat Mara and all his Maya. Reality is always better than shadows.

Radhakrishnan wants earlier held portfolios or nothing
Former Education State Minister, Nuwara Eliya Parliamentarian Velusami Radhakrishnan said that he would not accept a portfolio from the government if he cannot serve the public through it.
He was speaking to the media yesterday in Nuwara Eliya.
He said his party, the Up-Country People's Front (UCPF), supported the United National Party (UNP) in the political unrest on October 26 and thereafter.
Now a new government has been set up and two Cabinet Ministers should be given to his party. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe promised our Badulla District MP Aravind Kumar that he (PM) would appoint a Cabinet Minister and a Deputy Minister from our party when the new government was formed. Now the Cabinet comprises 30 ministers. We asked the government in writing to grant me my earlier portfolio and its Deputy Minister Post to Aravind Kumar, the former Minister said.
The Prime Minister promised us that he will give us what we asked for and we agreed. Now we came to know that I would be given a new portfolio and that the Deputy Minister post is not even in the list, he said.
If it is the situation, we will not accept any portfolio. But we do not join the opposition on this issue. We will support the UNP further. I do not want to accept a ministerial portfolio through which I cannot serve the public, the former Minister said.
He said that he believed that the Prime Minister would not discard his promises. We do not need any portfolio other than the ones we asked for, he said.

President of the memorial committee A.J. Preethi Ruwan Kumara said a decorated train had arrived with senior officials from the department to each tsunami commemoration so far. We invited the department officials this time as well, but they had discarded our invitation. We expressed our displeasure in this regard on behalf of the people in Peraliya, he said.

## Title: Rise and fall of JVP and JHU

## Section: Features

Election results 2004:
Rise and fall of JVP and JHU
The Jathika Hela Urumaya, [JHU] a non-minority group who fielded Buddhist Monks came up with some trumps assuming the king-makers role. They won 9 seats and the UPFA was short of eight, while the JVP in alliance with SLFP securing 41 were the highlights of April 2, 2004 Parliamentary Election.
The life expectancy of the new government as well as the constraints under which it would have to operate in fulfilling its mandate was doubted by outgoing PM Ranil Wickremesinghe. Former Prime Minister claimed that no party has an absolute majority in parliament to form a stable government. Wickremesinghe said the government, expected to take over shortly, would be a minority one which would be unable to carry out business in parliament. Another poll could not be ruled out, although the UNF would strive to preclude it. We have reached a state of affairs similar to the March 1960 elections where no party gained a majority. The party which got highest had not lasted long he said. According to him UNFs defeat was not due to the rejection of the peace process, but due to other issues.
The UNF formed in December 2001 obtained an absolute majority with 114 seats with a mandate to function for six years. We were on target and had come to a decisive stage when the President suddenly dissolved parliament and called for a general election. [Constitution prior to 19A allowed dissolution in 12 months] Now the result shows that no party has an absolute majority to tackle these issues. This itself poses problems. It is a question mark as to how long such a government could continue, he said.
It was not possible to count the exact number who voted for the UPFA because they liked the JVP, this party made incredible gains on April 2, 2004. They increased their numbers to 41, a gain of 25 over the 2001 result. Their candidates, most of the districts, came on top in preferential votes polled. This would mean that they make up close to half the support enjoyed by the UPFA. If the JVP listed 60 candidates they would have won about fifty seat in parliament; the JVP as it promised stayed corruption-free but not productive, otherwise they could very well achieved a higher share in the nomination list at a future election pushing the SLFP/UPFA slipping to third place or even to a worst position if the JHU improved based on their achievement. JVP beat several top SLFPers in the preference voting. JVP candidates topped the lists in most of the districts including Colombo, Gampaha, Galle, Kurunegala, Kegalle, Ratnapura and Kalutara while in some areas, they over took senior SLFPers.
Wimal Weerawansa was ahead of UPFA group leader Susil Premjayanth in Colombo while Anura Bandaranaike the Gampaha group leader was behind JVPs Vijitha Herath. All three top slots in Ratnapura and Galle districts were occupied by JVP members. Anura Kumara Dissanayake led in Kurunegala. Mangala Samaraweera and Mahinda Rajapaksa SLFP heavyweights. In Matara and Hambantota had JVPers hot on their trail. According to some SLFP sources at one stage the JVP had broken away from the UPFA campaign to launch its own propaganda, promoting its nominees. On a Presidential directive, the SLFP had called off its poster campaign midway, but the JVP had gone on pasting posters till the eleventh hour.
For the first time, both major parties suffered at 2004 polls. The voters were saying enough. They did not trust the two parties. If not for the number of JVP MPs and those secured by the other smaller parties of the Alliance, the SLFP would have got a little over 50 seats. The same with the UNF. Without the minority parties like CWC and SLMC, the UNP would be left with a little over 60 members. On April 2, 2004, the franchise holders of this country reduced both these parties the worst defeats they have suffered since the PR system came into being. They have proved beyond doubt that they are incapable of or will not deliver, and the people were not left high and dry without alternatives. The JHU grabbed a fair portion of UNF while JVP siphoned out quite a segment from UPFA, which is why, there were winners to talk about.
Another winner at 2004 was the Jathika Hela Urumaya polling over half a million votes and securing 9 seats, a performance that no one foresaw when CBK dissolved parliament in February or on nominations day. The result indicated the sense of discomfort among sections of the Buddhists in the country. The JVP and certain sections of the SLFP tried to tap into this nervousness among Buddhists by launching the Desha Hitheishee Jathika Vyaparaya, but the JHU was smart enough to know how they could handled the situation by entering the Bikkhus into the fray.
The people voted in 31 new faces through smaller parties; 25 through the JVP and nine from the JHU. Quite a few undesirable characters lost in the process, a sign of maturity exhibited by the electorate. The JHU, however failed to gain in the areas the political monks claimed as 100% Buddhist areas. Anuradhapura and Galle realized only 2.2%, Polonnaruwa and Monaragala just 1.3%, Matale, Matara Ratnapura and Kegalle a poor 4% are the votes they received. It is a good eye opener to genuine followers of the Buddha.
The UPFA threw every trump slandering the JHU bikkhus. They abused state media using monks loyal to the SLFP and the JVP to condemn the decision of the bikkhus to contest elections. They went to the extent to spread a rumour over state media on the eve of the election that the Sangha Council of the JHU had withdrawn en masse.
SLMC and UNF
A disputed electoral pact between the SLMC and UNF helped their opponents in the East and Puttalam that contributed to the final result.
This hastily arranged agreement, brought the two parties to contest Trincomalee, Ampara, and Batticaloa districts separately. Kurunegala they contested under the UNF ticket, with UNP giving into an unreasonable SLMC demand that only one Muslim candidate should be on the Puttalam list.
CWC leader A. Thondaman threatened to have his party contest the Kandy and Nuwara Eliya districts on their own if the UNF denied nomination to CWC nominee Mustapha, CWC sources said. Mustapha succeeded in his bid.
President Kumaratungas desire for power
The power sharing struggle reached a new height with the take-over of the three Ministries by CBK on November 4, 2003 and subsequently dissolving and calling a General Election. UNPers attribute this crisis to President Kumaratungas desire for power and her devious scheming for eliminating all impediments for her to remain at the highest levels in politics after 2005. It is also surmised that the pressure from the extremist factions including JVP with whom her party struck an alliance the Sandanaya and contesting this election - may have been among other vital reasons.
One cannot however discount the successes of UNF during the two and a half years under the Leadership of Wickremesinghe. The successes were in the economic spheres. Signing the controversial MoU with LTTE though failed to achieve expected outcome; laying foundation towards re-establishing political stability which the country lacked during the past two decades were considered achievements.

Saudi King orders Govt. reshuffle after Khashoggi fallout
SAUDI ARABIA: Saudi Arabia's King Salman ordered a sweeping government reshuffle Thursday, replacing key security and political figures including the foreign minister, as the kingdom grapples with the international fallout over critic Jamal Khashoggi's murder.
The surprise shake-up saw the appointment of new ministers of the powerful National Guard, information and education, as well as the head of a new space agency, but the energy and finance ministries were unaffected despite an economic downturn.
The revamp left untouched the authority of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler facing intense international scrutiny over the October 2 murder of journalist Khashoggi, which tipped the kingdom into one of its worst crises.
Ibrahim al-Assaf, a former finance minister who was detained last year in an anti-corruption sweep, will replace Adel al-Jubeir as foreign minister, a royal decree said.
Jubeir, who sought to defend the tainted government internationally after Khashoggi's murder, was effectively demoted to minister of state for foreign affairs, the decree added without explaining the change.
In other significant appointments, Prince Abdullah bin Bandar was named chief of the powerful National Guard, and Musaed al-Aiban, a Harvard graduate, was appointed the new national security adviser.
The reshuffle would help the crown prince further consolidate power as many of those promoted were his key allies, tweeted Ali Shihabi, head of the pro-Saudi think tank The Arabia Foundation.
In other changes, Turki al-Shabanah, an executive at broadcaster Rotana, was appointed as the new information minister, replacing Awwad al-Awwad -- who was named as an advisor to the royal court.
Turki al-Sheikh, a close aide to the crown prince, was removed as the head of the kingdom's sports commission and appointed entertainment authority chief, while Ahmed al-Khatib was named tourism authority chief.
The king also ordered the creation of a national space agency to be led by one of his other sons, Prince Sultan bin Salman, a former astronaut.
The energy, economy and finance ministries were left untouched even as the petro-state faces a sharp fall in crude prices that has generated renewed uncertainty over Prince Mohammed's Vision 2030 reform programme for a post-oil era.
But the appointment as foreign minister of Assaf, who holds a seat on the boards of state oil giant Aramco and the vast Public Investment Fund, indicates an emphasis on economic diplomacy as the kingdom seeks to reassure foreign investors rattled by the Khashoggi crisis, analysts say.
Assaf was held in Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel last year along with hundreds of elite princes and businessmen, in what the government called an anti-corruption crackdown. - AFP

Removal of steel plates from China Bay oil tanks
Seven suspects arrested
Police on Thursday arrested seven suspects who tried to cut and remove steel plates from oil tanks in the China Bay oil storage facility to sell them for scrap metal.
The suspects were arrested on a complaint made by the Security Division of Lanka Indian Oil Corporation (LIOC).
These oil tanks were built by the British during World War II, but had been lying idle for many years. The suspects were arrested with a haul of steel plates removed from the oil tanks.
The suspects had entered the premises from the section of the tank farm that is covered by shrub jungle. The suspects had allegedly caused Rs. 9 million in damages to two tanks, according to LIOC sources.
The China Bay Police is investigating.
Several incidents of robbing steel parts of tanks had also been reported previously.
The steel plates used to construct the tanks have a thickness of two and half inches and are fixed by using bolt nuts.
The tank farm premises extends to about 685 acres and a part of it is covered by jungle.
The Trincomalee oil storage facility comprises a total of 99 tanks and 15 of them located in the lower tank farm are currently being used by the LIOC. The Government recently came up with a proposal to develop the idling oil tanks by way of a joint venture between the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and the LIOC.

Speaker urges religious leaders to act against racism
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya made an earnest plea from religious leaders to raise their voices against racism and in support of the abolishing of the Executive Presidency in the coming year.
The Speakers Media Division in a press statement yesterday said that the Speaker made the above request during a special meeting with multi-religious representatives at the Speakers official residence on Wednesday.
The Speaker spearheaded a multi-religious conference following the racial tensions in Kandy and Ampara early this year. With the multi-religious representatives of this initiative, he held special meetings in Kandy and Ampara to promote national harmony and reconciliation.
Speaker Jayasuriya meeting those multi-religious representatives on Thursday requested their leadership to denounce the attempts to incite ethnic and religious hatred in the North and the South while observing that certain political figures were also behind such attempts.
The Speaker also requested not to let the politicians spread racism using temples and other religious places as the hub.
The Speaker also made a special request from the multi-religious representatives to support the peoples long-standing call to abolish the Executive Presidency.
The Speaker was of the view that the excessive powers of the Executive Presidency are too heavy for Parliamentary democracy.
The Speaker at the meeting pledged his unwavering commitment to abolish the Executive Presidency in the same way he committed to uphold good governance and ethical conduct from the very first day he entered into politics.
He made that comment recalling how hard he committed to the 17th Amendment to the Constitution.
The Speaker also recalled that it was late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera who lined up the masses against anti-democratic and emerging autocratic rule in the country then.
That social movement was necessary not to bring in one individual to power but to empower democracy by implementing a set of common policies. Setting up of the Constitutional Council and independent commissions, and establishing the right to information law and independence of judiciary were achievements within a short period, but it is unfortunate that we could still not achieve the goal of abolishing the Executive Presidency, the Speaker commented.
The Speaker also pointed out that the trust between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe gradually deteriorated after the Local Government polls were declared.
I continuously tried to make peace between them. It was true that the President offered me the Prime Minister post on several occasions, but I didnt want to accept any post which the people had not given me a mandate, he added.
The Speaker, explaining on the challenges he faced during the seven weeks from October 26, said that he was determined not to give in to thuggery.
I knew the risk. There were threats of acid attacks against me inside the Chamber, but had I not taken that risk, it could have been a dark day for the Parliamentary system of our country. Who won in the past two months is not important as the country lost a great deal during that time, he remarked.
He however pointed out that the assurance that we have an independent judiciary was a positive outcome of the political crisis. From now on, nobody will talk about the need for the intervention of international judges into our countrys affairs, he said.
The Speaker requested the religious leaders to play the role of reconciliation as disputes between the President and the Prime Minister, being two centres of power, are harmful to the country though there seems to be temporary settlement.

Tennis royalty Federer and Serena back for yet another season
PERTH, Friday - Tennis royalty Roger Federer and Serena Williams have been pounding balls across the net for more than 20 years and they are back for yet another season, starting in Perth at the mixed teams Hopman Cup from Saturday.
Both 37 years old and with 43 Grand Slam singles titles between them, Federer is now a father and Williams a mother but tennis keeps calling, with neither showing any sign of quitting.
Flying Federer leads Switzerland in defence of the Hopman Cup title he won alongside Belinda Bencic earlier this year, with the pair teaming up once again.
Williams returns to the country for the first time since her famous Australian Open win in 2017, when eight-weeks pregnant with baby Alexis Olympia.
She partners rising American star Frances Tiafoe in her fifth visit to Western Australia.
In a mouthwatering prospect, Switzerland play the United States on January 1 with two of the greatest players ever facing each other in the mixed doubles.
Federer conceded it was a once-in-a-lifetime match-up and one he was looking forward to.
Well probably play it down a little bit and say its not that big of a deal for us, its just another tennis match, but it really isnt because its probably going to happen once and never again, he said on Thursday.
The Swiss great has spent the off-season training hard ahead of the defence of his Australian Open title and said he was happy with his fitness.
The last three or four weeks have been very intense. Im very excited and motivated for this next season.
The last two seasons the Swiss legend started in Perth, he went on to win the opening Grand Slam of the year.
WENT TOO FAR
Williams played an exhibition against sister Venus in Abu Dhabi this week, but Perth will be her first competitive event since her meltdown in the US Open final this year.
She received a code violation for coaching, a penalty point for racquet abuse and a game penalty for calling the umpire a liar and a thief during her defeat by Naomi Osaka.
Federer later said Williams went too far and should have walked away, adding an edge to their upcoming encounter.
Williams opted not to talk about the rant in Abu Dhabi, instead preferring to look forward.
My fitness, I feel like Im pretty fit, she said, adding that she was excited by another season as she primes to win an eighth crown at Melbourne Park to match the record 24 Grand Slam titles held by Margaret Court.
I havent played with Frances in mixed doubles before, but have watched him from afar this year. He has a very bright future and Im looking forward to being on court with him, it will be a lot of fun, she said.
Tiafoe, 20, is considered one of the worlds most impressive Next Gen stars.
He won his first singles title in February to become the youngest American champion on tour since Andy Roddick in 2002 and hit a career high ranking of 38 in August.
Im extremely nervous to play with Serena, a complete legend, he admitted. But Im sure itll be fine.
Germans Alexander Zverev and Angelique Kerber, the beaten 2018 finalists, form a formidable partnership in the way of Switzerland and the United States.
Zverev had a breakout 2018 season and is now ranked world number four, one behind Federer, while Kerber is world number two after winning Wimbledon, where she beat Williams in the final.
Two-time Grand Slam champion Garbine Muguruza partners David Ferrer for Spain while perennial favourites France are back with Lucas Pouille and Alize Cornet.
Australia (Matt Ebdon/Ashleigh Barty), Greece (Stefanos Tsitsipas/Maria Sakkari) and Britain (Cameron Norrie/Katie Boulter) make up the field. AFP

Tons from Latham, Nicholls give New Zealand colossal lead
Centuries from Tom Latham and Henry Nicholls put New Zealand in line for a defining victory over Sri Lanka Friday in the second Test with a 659-run second innings lead and the tourists losing early wickets in their record chase.
New Zealand, who led by 74 on the first innings, declared their second innings on day three in Christchurch at 585 for four with Latham scoring 176 to go with his unbeaten 264 in the drawn first Test.
Nicholls was not out on a career best 162 with healthy contributions from Jeet Raval (74) and Colin de Grandhomme (71 not out). Sri Lanka at stumps were 24 for two with Dinesh Chandimal on 14 and Kusal Menis on six.
Victory for New Zealand would give them a fourth consecutive series win for the first time after wins over the West Indies, England and Pakistan in the past year.
With more than two days left, Sri Lanka had reason for patience but lost both openers -- Dimuth Karunaratne without scoring and Danushka Gunathilaka (four) -- in the first two overs.
No team has ever scored more than 418 in a successful fourth innings run chase and the pitch continues to offer some assistance to the New Zealand bowlers.
Sri Lanka, however, were less effective with the ball and de Grandhomme in particular was scoring freely when Kane Williamson declared midway through the final session.
De Grandhomme, who had six fours and two sixes in his whirlwind innings, passed the 50 mark in a New Zealand record 28 deliveries, one better than the previous best by Tim Southee against England 10 years ago.
New Zealand resumed Friday at 231 for two and Latham, whose unbeaten 264 in the drawn first Test is the top score in all Test cricket this year, continued his purple patch with grim determination through 370 deliveries.
For the most part, it was a near faultless innings, although he was dropped by Dushmantha Chameera on 32 and survived an lbw review on 75. But, on the stroke of tea, Chameera made the breakthrough when he had Latham caught behind off a faint legside edge.
The only reward with the new ball in the morning session came when Lahiru Kumara trapped Ross Taylor in front to claim the senior batsmans wicket for 40.
Latham and Nicholls put on 214 for the fourth wicket with Latham achieving his eighth century and Nicholls his fourth. Only three times in cricket history has the winning side scored more than
400 in the fourth innings, while the current record held by the West Indies is 418 for seven against Australia 15 years ago in Antigua.
The highest fourth innings score in the modern era is New Zealands 451 chasing 550 against England in 2002, while England scored 654 for five after being set a target of 696 by South Africa in 1939.
Unlike the first Test in Wellington, where rain washed out most of the final day, fine weather is forecast for the remainder of the Christchurch Test.

Warner will be welcomed back with open arms - Finch
MELBOURNE, Thursday - Australias limited overs skipper Aaron Finch insists the divisive David Warner will be welcomed back with open arms despite ongoing fallout Friday from tell-all ball-tampering interviews by Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft.
Bancroft and Smith have caused a storm by opening up in recent days over the scandal as they re-emerge into public life, with their comments widely interpreted as deflecting all blame onto Warner.
A number of high-profile figures have blasted them for dragging the issue back into the spotlight and detracting from the ongoing third Test against India in Melbourne.
Some believe the relationship between Bancroft and Warner is now untenable while local reports have suggested opposition to Warner remains within the Australian team.
But Finch, the one-day and Twenty20 captain, insisted they would all be welcomed back.
Its nine months ago and I think in the next three months when Davey and Steve are ready to be allowed to come back and play cricket for Australia and their states I think from my point of view, theyll be welcomed back with open arms, he said.
I think that whatever has happened has happened, he added.
The punishment has been dealt. Theyve been working really hard off the field to meet every criteria and gone above and beyond everything that has been asked of them to come back and play international cricket again.
Finchs support is seen as important after Cricket Australia chief Kevin Roberts was quoted by Sydneys Daily Telegraph as saying he would canvass the dressing room to see if they were wanted.
Smith and Warner were banned for a year from international and domestic cricket for their part in using sandpaper to alter the ball in South Africa in March.
Bancroft was suspended for nine months and is due to make his return this weekend.
Former Australian internationals Ricky Ponting and Dean Jones have both criticised Smith and Bancroft for giving the interviews, and Allan Border also weighed in.
My personal view is I would have preferred the interviews werent done, he told Fox Sports.
Theyre just rehashing a lot of stuff we already know and what was the point of it all They could have just admitted theyre all responsible for doing the wrong thing.
Bancroft confirmed in his interview that Warner asked him to alter the ball while Smith admitted he failed as a captain by turning a blind eye to what went on.
Warner has not responded to the latest revelations.  AFP

Redemption: Wild Oats XI wins record ninth Sydney-Hobart race
SYDNEY, Friday - Supermaxi Wild Oats XI won its ninth line honours in the Sydney to Hobart ocean race Friday to become the most successful yacht in the history of the gruelling competition.
In a thrilling finish to the 628-nautical mile (1,163-kilometre) bluewater classic down Australias east coast that saw an unprecedented battle between four supermaxis, the 100-footer crossed the finish line first in Hobart.
The victory was particularly special for Wild Oats XI skipper Mark Richards and the crew, after being stripped of their win last year when they were handed a one-hour penalty over a near-collision.
Redemption for us, that is for sure. Last year, it was so disappointing, Richards told reporters after reaching Hobart.
Whether people like it or not, it is Wild Oats XIs 10th time over that line first, no matter what anyone else says... After an event like last year and to come through and redeem yourself is a wonderful feeling, money cant buy it.
Richards marked the win at Constitution Dock with a trademark Australian shoey celebration, which involves drinking champagne out of a shoe, before he was thrown into the Derwent River by the crew.
FIERCE BATTLE
The 74th edition of the annual contest was characterised by a neck-and-neck battle between four supermaxis -- the biggest and fastest yachts -- Wild Oats XI, Comanche, Black Jack, and Infotrack.
Wild Oats XI and last years defending champion Comanche had been taking turns to be in the lead since the fleet of yachts departed a sunny Sydney Harbour on Boxing Day.
But after leading the race overnight, Wild Oats XI surged ahead of Comanche early Thursday, choosing to swing east in pursuit of faster winds in what Richards described as a game-winning manoeuvre.
Black Jack finished second, ahead of Comanche and Infotrack.
Richards said he was particularly proud of how 14-year-old Wild Oats XI fared against the quality of the other supermaxis, calling it the Phar Lap of yachting in a nod to Australias greatest racehorse.
COULD NOT BE HAPPIER
The result is a relief for the Oatley family, which owns Wild Oats XI, after the boat had to retire from the 2015 and 2016 races. The vessels previous win was in 2014.
This is absolutely fantastic. Words fail me, owner Sandy Oatley told commercial broadcaster Channel Seven.
I could not be happier. The whole family is really happy.
Lighter winds meant the fleet could not match last years record pace of one day, nine hours, 15 minutes and 24 seconds set by Comanche.
Wild Oats XI finished with a time of one day, 19 hours, seven minutes and 21 seconds.
Attention now turns to the handicap honours -- the race to be the vessel that performs best according to size -- with 2017 winner TP52 Ichi Ban in the lead.
The fleet in the often brutal contest dropped from 85 to 80 during the dash south from Sydney, with Hong Kong supermaxi Scallywag the most prominent retirement with a broken bowsprit.
Challenging conditions and storms are not unknown to the race, with six people dying on one night in 1998 when a deep depression exploded over the fleet in the treacherous Bass Strait between the Australian mainland and Tasmania.
The fleet marked the 20th anniversary of the tragedy on Thursday with a moment of silence and the reading of a message of commemoration. AFP

All Blacks stumble with eye on World Cup
PARIS - Double defending champions New Zealand will head into the 2019 World Cup in Japan as favourites, but Six Nations Grand Slam champions Ireland have proven there are chinks in the All Black armour.
Steve Hansens team suffered a major bump on their run-in to the World Cup when they went down to a second defeat in three games by a Johnny Sexton-inspired Ireland, whose provincial side Leinster won the European Champions Cup, Munster also making the last four. That followed the Springboks 36-34 victory in Wellington in September that ended a 15-match winning streak for the All Blacks, who have dominated world rugby since securing their second World Cup title in England in 2015 after previous success on home turf in 2011.
Excluding the 24-21 defeat by the British and Irish Lions in the drawn series in 2017, it was New Zealands first defeat at home since 2009.
Irelands 16-9 victory over the All Blacks in Dublin in November was built on a teak-tough defence organised by former England assistant coach and dual code international Andy Farrell -- the father of England fly-half Owen -- who will take over the reins from current coach Joe Schmidt post-World Cup. As of now they are the number-one team in the world, Hansen said. So if you want to make them World Cup favourites, go ahead. I guess they are favourites.
The bookies say not, however, with New Zealand installed above Ireland, England, South Africa and Wales. New Zealand top the world rankings, followed by Ireland, Wales and England and it is hard to envisage a World Cup like the last one when the southern hemisphere provided all four semi-finalists.
ENGLAND ON THE UP
England, who had a catastrophic 2015 World Cup on home soil as they failed to advance from their pool, finished 2018 with an impressive mix of forward power and stylish back-line play during a 37-18 win over Australia, the losing finalists three years ago, at Twickenham.
It meant they had won three of their four November Tests, the lone loss an agonising 16-15 defeat by New Zealand.
That was all far removed from a run of five straight defeats earlier this year that spanned the Six Nations and a 2-1 series loss in South Africa.
Weve got great competition (for places), said England coach Eddie Jones, whose side still have problems over their often high penalty count. To be the best in the world youve got to push hard.
BOKS BUOYANT
It was also a case of role reversal for two-time World Cup champions South Africa, a side rejuvenated under new coach Rassie Erasmus and dynamic captain Siya Kolisi after a disastrous couple of seasons.
Weve shown on the day when everythings aligned and the guys are all in the same frame of mind, we can beat the All Blacks away and win a series against England, said Erasmus. Its wide open, he said of the World Cup. Ive been involved in World Cups since 1995, but really this one I couldnt put money on whos going to be in the semi-finals.
The Springboks final November game saw them lose 20-11 to a Wales side hoping to go to Japan under the radar despite having completed their first ever November clean sweep and extended their winning Test run to nine matches.
We want to keep doing what were doing, slip under the radar as much as possible, said Wales coach Warren Gatland.
Frances largely miserable 2018 ended with their first defeat by Fiji, who won 21-14 in Paris.
But both France and Australia, who also had a year to forget, have often put poor results behind come a World Cup.
Tier-Two nation Fijis win augurs well for the competitiveness of the group stage in Japan and will have been noted by pool opponents Wales -- a team they knocked out of the 2007 tournament -- and Australia.

Anderson double sees Hammers come back to sink Saints
London Thursday: Felipe Anderson scored twice as West Ham came from a goal behind to win 2-1 away to Southampton in the Premier League on Thursday.
After a lacklustre first half at St Mary's, all three goals came in a nine-minute spell early in the second half, with Nathan Redmond firing the Saints ahead before Brazilian star Anderson's double put West Ham on top.
Victory saw the Hammers climb into ninth place in the table while Southampton, denied a third straight win under new boss Ralph Hasenhuttl, remained in 16th spot just three points above the relegation zone.
West Ham captain Aaron Cresswell, commenting about Anderson, told Sky Sports: Felipe's two goals were unbelievable and we got the three points. He has been fantastic. He's our top goalscorer and he's our in-form man. Meanwhile Redmond suggested a busy run of games could have caught up with Southampton, saying: We're not too sure how that game got away from us. Maybe it's the volume of games at the moment. It's rest, recover, play, rest, recover.
Maybe we were a bit leggy in terms of pressing. But managing the game when we're ahead, we have to look at that. West Ham named just six substitutes at St Mary's, with manager Manuel Pellegrini's injury-hit side showing five changes from the team that lost 2-0 to Watford on Saturday.
By contrast, Hasenhuttl made only one change from the team that beat Huddersfield 3-1 last weekend, with Mario Lemina replacing the suspended Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg.
Clear chances were few and far between in a mediocre opening 45 minutes.
Southampton's Danny Ings, on his 200th club appearance, toe-poked the ball narrowly wide of the near post in the third minute.
At the other end, Lucas Perez squandered West Ham's best chance of the half when he shot wide following good work by Cresswell on the left.
Shortly before half-time, West Ham's Robert Snodgrass curled a shot from the edge of the box well wide of Southampton keeper Alex McCarthy's right post. broke the deadlock five minutes into the second half with a scrappy goal. West Ham, playing for an offside flag that never came, left Redmond in yards of space inside the box.
The Southampton forward's shot was blocked by Hammers keeper Lukasz Fabianski. Oriel Romeu then tried to chip the ball over Fabianski before Redmond, sliding in face first, forced the ball in under pressure from the scrambling Angelo Ogbonna.
But three minutes later, West Ham equalised when Anderson shot through a crowd of players to beat McCarthy with a powerful effort.
And from 1-0 down, West Ham were 2-1 up in the 59th minute when Anderson scored his second of the game and eighth in the league this season.

Australia Test cricketer Khawajas brother re-arrested
SYDNEY, Friday - The brother of Australian Test cricketer Usman Khawaja has been charged with trying to influence a witness over a case where he allegedly framed a love rival with a fake terror plot, police said Friday.
Arsalan Khawaja was released on bail in early December after appearing in a Sydney court on charges of forgery and attempting to pervert justice.
He was re-arrested on Thursday after allegedly attempting to influence a witness in the counter-terror investigation, a New South Wales state police spokeswoman told AFP.
The 39-year-old was charged with breaching his bail conditions and influencing a witness in judicial procedures. He was refused bail ahead of his court appearance in Sydney later Friday.
Sri Lankan Mohamed Nizamdeen was arrested in August over a hit list written in a notebook, which outlined plans to kill then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull.
But police released Nizamdeen in September and later dropped the charges after investigators could not link the handwriting in the notebook to him.
Investigators have said they believe Arsalan Khawaja set up his university colleague Nizamdeen in relation to a dispute over a woman.
Pakistan-born batsman Usman Khawaja, 32, is playing in the ongoing third Test between Australia and India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.  AFP

Book launch - Compassionate Buddha of the Rock
The Compassionate Buddha of the Rock, a book written by the late Deshabandu Deivanayagam Pillai Eassuwaran, will be launched at the New Kathiresan Hall, Bambalapitiya on January 6,, 2019 to commemorate the first year death anniversary of the author.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, a trustees of the Samadi Buddha Statue Construction Committee, will be the Chief Guest and MP Arumugam Thondaman will preside over the launch of the book, written in Sinhala, Tamil and English in one volume.
DSI Chairman Nandadasa will deliver the keynote speech. Kambavarthi Jeyaraj will deliver its tamil version.
The book describes the historical significance of the 67-feet tall Samadhi Buddha statue on the 72-feet rock of the Moneragala Vidya Sagara Buddha Vihara at Rambodagalla near Kurunegala. This is the first time a granite Buddha sculpture was created out of a granite rock, after 850 years of the era of granite sculptures of the country.
South Indian sculptor of world fame Shri Muthutiah from Chennai, undertook the colossal project of carving the statue out of a granite rock along with 28 other sculptors in 2002.
This masterpiece of art, the Samadhi Buddha statue was unveiled by President Maithripala Sirisena in June, 2015 amidst a large gathering of devotees.
The book Compassionate Buddha of the Rock is a living testimony to the religious and ethnic harmony among the people of different faiths in Sri Lanka.
The book describes the incredible story of how the amazing 67.5 Samadhi Buddha statue was carved in Rambadagala, Kurunegala, a small village in Sri Lanka.
It is a story of inspiration and faith.
The carving of the Buddha Statue in the rock was a gigantic work undertaken by Ven. Egodamulle Amaramouli Thera of the Moneragala Temple, Rambodagalla, Rideegama, Kurunegala. This was in response to several youth who wanted to revolt against the Muslims and attack mosques when the youth came to know that the ancient Bamiyan Buddha Statues were bombed by the Taliban in Afghanistan.
The Thera admonished the youth, citing the Buddha as a living example who never took revenge. The Thera told the youth to show compassion and commence carving the Buddha statue in the Rambadagalla rock, close to the temple where the Monk resided.
Thereafter, the youth collected Rs. 200,000 and returned to the Thera and requested him to commence the work of carving the statue of the Buddha in the rock. The Thera accepted the challenge.
Eassuwaren, a businessman and philanthropist, the owner of Eswaran brothers in Colombo, then the President of the Chinmaya Mission in Sri Lanka, who constructed the Hanuman temple, came forward to support the Thera in carving the statue.
The author recalls how former Minister Jeyaraj Fernandopulle and former Colombo Deputy Mayor Edward Edirisuriya came to his assistance when he was in dire need of help.
Book was first written in Tamil and was translated into Sinhala and English.  WIRUMA

Bumrah breaks several records and internet too
Jasprit Bumrah spearheaded an inspired Indian attack, grabbing a career-best haul of 6/33 to wrap up Australias first innings on 151 on day three of the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Friday.
Bumrah picked the wickets of Marcus Harris, Shaun Marsh, Travis Head, Tim Paine, Nathan Lyon and Josh Hazlewood to claim his third five-wicket haul in Tests.
He also became the first Asian bowler to take five-wicket hauls in Australia, England and South Africa in the same calendar year.
Bumrah is now Indias joint leading wicket-taker in Tests in 2018 along with Mohammed Shami.
Impressed by the 25-year-olds record-breaking feat, former cricketers and experts showered praise on Bumrahs display of fierce precision.
VVS LAXMAN: What an outstanding bowling effort from India and a really special effort from Jasprit Bumrah. He has been the best bowler on display across both sides by some distance and has put India in a really dominating position.
HARSHA BOGLE: India have found a treasure in Jasprit Bumrah. So young and already so accomplished.
VIRENDER SEHWAG: Jasprit Bumrah this years biggest gain. What a great effort from India to bowl out Australia for 151.
I pray the weather stays well and India win this MCG Test for the brilliant cricket they have played.
MOHAMMAD KAIF: What a difference Jasprit Bumrah has made. I feel he has made the difference for the Indian attack from being very good to outstanding. 292 is a huge lead and India would be sensing one hand on the Border Gavaskar Trophy. Need to not give Australia a chance
CRICKETWALLAH: In many ways Bumrah has been the find of the year in Test cricket. The last delivery before lunch  fast, swinging yorker which got Shaun Marsh  shows why. Great session for India.
With 45 wickets to his name now, Bumrah also surpassed Dileep Doshi to register most wickets for India in his debut year in Test cricket. In 1979, Doshi took 40 wickets, which was a record till Bumrah just broke it.
Venkatesh Prasad is third on the list with 37 wickets in 1996. Narendra Hirwani with 36 wickets in 1988 and S Sreesanth with 35 in 2006 complete the top five.
Interestingly, Bumrah also recorded the best figures for any Indian bowler in Tests at the MCG, surpassing Bhagwath Chandrasekhars 6/52 in 1977.
Bumrahs effort is also the second-best for an Indian fast bowler in Tests in Australia, behind only Kapil Devs 8/106 at Adelaide in 1985. As far as the match is concerned, Australia were skittled for 151 on day three.
India opted against enforcing the follow-on and decided to build on their first-innings lead of 292 runs.
The four-match Test series is currently tied at 1-1.

Autobiography: Pushing the Boundaries:
Derek Pringle Englands other maverick after Ian Botham
Picture the scene. An emerging all-rounder, barely out of university, is in his first summer of Test cricket and doing his utmost to fit in with some of crickets biggest names by proving he belongs in the sacred surroundings of Lords.
Only Derek Pringle, big news back then in 1982 for being picked for England while still at Cambridge and wearing an ear stud, does not do it by attempting to demonstrate he is capable of living up on the field to what became a well-worn tag of becoming the new Ian Botham.
Instead Pringle, excited by the presence in the Lords dressing room of a new-fangled video recorder, decides to impress off it by bringing in a film for the England team to enjoy if ever a moment for quiet reflection presented itself during battle against Pakistan.
So that is how the England team, far from offering encouragement on the balcony to Chris Tavare while he applied himself to keeping out the Pakistan attack, came to be watching a production with, shall we say, an adult theme, called Billys Big Banana.
It had little artistic merit, says Pringle, taking up the story, though the dubbed dialogue was so naff as to be hilarious. Now, being fairly new technology at the time, nobody had worked out how to mute the video, or even to switch it off except at the mains.
So when Peter May, the chairman of selectors, walked in just as things were getting interesting, in the film as opposed to the match, we improvised by pausing the video on freeze frame. Despite standing in front of the telly, which was on a shelf just above head height, May was oblivious.
The tension went on for at least 20 minutes during which general tittering turned into nervous laughter until the mood was finally broken by Tavares dismissal for 82 which brought to an end his six-and-a-half-hour vigil. To our relief May chose to leave the dressing room to give Tav some space.
The postscript came when the distinctly undemonstrative Tavare returned to join his team-mates, perhaps expecting some hard-earned congratulations. Not a bit of it. Never one for histrionics, Tav took off his pads, gloves and box without ceremony and packed them neatly in his bag, continues Pringle. Having towelled himself down Tav suddenly noticed us all looking at him. It was only then he glanced up at the screen to be confronted by in flagrante delicto on pause. Tav was a man of iron constitution and his face did not shift an iota. Dry as old parchment, he said, Nice to see you lads have been watching me bat. I know Im boring but it hasnt been that bad, has it
This remarkable true story is told in what must surely be the cricket book of the year, Pringles entertaining, informative and at times downright uproarious look at the game in the 80s through the lens of his own eventful times spent with Essex and England. It was puerile and most definitely in bad taste, says Pringle, 60, of the Billys Big Banana episode. But I would have done anything at that time to be one of the lads.
How he succeeded in doing that in a career which brought him 30 Test and 44 one-day international appearances during an era that perfectly suited his curious mind, sense of adventure and determination to enjoy every benefit of being an England cricketer. Now, after 25 years in his second successful career as a highly respected writer and commentator on the game, Pringle has decided to tell his own story during an extraordinary time for the game jam packed with big characters and even bigger scandals.
I did have a lot of fun writing the book but who wouldnt enjoy a self-indulgent trawl through ones past says Pringle now in the shadow of Trinity College in Cambridge, where in his student days he appeared as an extra in the Oscar-winning film Chariots of Fire.
Its not really an autobiography because theres nothing in it from before I was 19 or 20. I thought Id stick to the 80s as it was the last decade of the maverick cricketer. That was the last era where players had real freedom.
And what freedom they had judging by Pushing the Boundaries. Cricket in the Eighties. Playing Home and Away. This is so choc-full of rip-roaring tales of drinking, womanising and general excess that it is a wonder how Pringle and company ever had enough energy to play cricket.
But how the likes of Ian Botham, Graham Gooch, David Gower et al could play the game, and this is as much a tribute to them and their ilk and a lament to how much Pringle believes has been lost in the coach driven modern era of ultra professionalism.
It was fantastic to play then because there were not only some hugely talented home grown players around but we had the cream of the international game in county cricket, says Pringle. And I truly believed standards never suffered through what went on off the field. By the 80s
every county had one or two world-class overseas players and therefore the standard of county cricket was pretty high.
Above all, Pringle loved being surrounded by individuals and, far from the establishments early hopes for him as leadership potential being an ex-public schoolboy and Cambridge graduate, he desperately wanted to be a maverick himself.
I think the era suited my personality, he said. I came from a sort of amateur background at Cambridge and even though we were professional it was definitely with a small p. We had a captain at Essex in Keith Fletcher who was an outstanding reader of the game and he always said to us, I dont care what you get up to in the evening as long as its legal. Just make
sure youre ready to play for me at 11am the next day and give it a hundred per cent.
Pringle was clearly in thrall to Botham then and talks with real affection and respect for him in the book. Beefy has always been a very generous guy, says a man who, like so many others, never was able to become that new Botham the game so craved. You dont want to make an enemy of him but if he liked you he was very kind and loyal to most of the people he played
with.
It was fantastic to watch him up close and the most incredible thing was his self-belief. Hed still be talking up your chances of winning when you were following on. All things were possible to him.
With Botham came a showbiz entourage barely believable in todays game that brought the biggest names in music down to the homely surroundings of New Road just to be near him.
Theres a pic of Eric Clapton, Elton John, George Harrison and Jeff Lynne all watching a county match at Worcester, which wouldnt happen today, smiled Pringle. It was solely the Beefy effect. He turned heads. He got people noticing cricket. The best we got at Chelmsford at the time was Jimmy White and, once, a visit from Gary Lineker.
One evening in Worcester was one of the greatest of my career. Clapton came and played guitar for us in a local pub. People forget Beefy was the most famous and recognisable sportsman of the 80s. It wasnt any footballer. Kevin Keegan and Glenn Hoddle were around but Beefy outshone them.
Times have changed enormously but Pringle for one is clearly not convinced that they have necessarily changed for the better, even though the occasionally shambolic era he played in was summed up by his chapter on the extraordinary summer of 1988. England had no fewer than four captains during yet another thrashing by West Indies and, for two sessions when all else had failed and Gooch was injured, Pringle himself was at the helm as a fifth leader.
The talent was definitely there in the 80s but maybe not the desire to apply it every day, he says. I was young when I started and the players always seemed big, bold characters. Im older now but I just dont see how things are better.
I think by its nature coach culture can destroy freedom and self-expression. Its just a shame the box has been opened. You speak to someone like Goochie who has been on both sides of the fence and he will tell you modern players cant do without having a coach so they can cry on their shoulder or lean against them.
He adds: In the 80s you had to fend for yourself more. You do wonder if there had been todays dieticians, isotonic drinks and an early to bed regime whether the players would have expressed themselves the same way.
Its one of lifes imponderables. Some things might have been better but some things might have been worse.
Would we have had those great feats from people like Botham and Gower if there had been a prescriptive coach culture England might have got more results but Im not sure whether we would have seen those incredible individual performances.
The book ends at the start of the 90s with Pringle describing his role in the greatest of all England one-day sides  it is difficult to imagine Ben Stokes warming up for next years World Cup by appearing in pantomime as
Botham did in 1992  and how his life might have turned out had he trapped Javed Miandad lbw at a critical stage of the final against Pakistan in Melbourne.
Inevitably Ive wondered how different things might have been had Javed been given out and wed won the World Cup. But it wasnt the first time an appeal has been turned down when the batsman was adjacent. In fact there were two appeals in the same over and both were pretty plumb. But I wasnt too upset about it immediately afterwards. Some friends have had fantasies
on my behalf that I might have been given the freedom of Chelmsford or married Liz Hurley but its not something that keeps me awake at night.
I saw (umpire) Steve Bucknor at a cocktail party a couple of years later when I had become a journalist and I said, Is Javed still not out Steve And he blanked me. Im told we were the best England one-day side by people who were there but you have to say Eoin Morgans team are playing some incredible cricket.
They perhaps need to go one better than us and win the cup next year to take our mantle.
These guys like to plan years ahead now but the fact I took the new ball in that tournament in 1992 was a late decision and Beefy talked himself
into opening the batting just before the cup. You dont necessarily have to make all your plans so far in advance. You have to be flexible in your thinking. You have to go with a good gut feeling.
Life in the 80s was full of late planning, gut instincts and, yes, chaos at times. But the players had a lot of fun as well as often producing thrilling, memorable cricket. And Pringle for one wouldnt have missed it for the world.

Elgar and Amla guide S. Africa to victory in opening Test
CENTURION Dec 28: Dean Elgar and Hashim Amla hit half-centuries as South Africa beat Pakistan by six wickets inside three days in the first Test at SuperSport Park on Friday.
The pair survived some early scares and put on 119 for the second wicket before Elgar was caught behind off part-time medium-pacer Shan Masood for 50, one ball after reaching his half-century.
Amla finished a year in which he seldom found top form by making 63 not out.
The value of the partnership between Elgar and Amla was shown as Theunis de Bruyn and captain Faf du Plessis both fell cheaply before Temba Bavuma swept Yasir Shah for four to take South Africa past their target of 149 shortly before tea on the third day.
Both captains, Du Plessis and Pakistans Sarfraz Ahmed, made pairs by being dismissed without scoring in both innings.
Pakistan made an ideal start when Hasan Ali trapped Aiden Markram leg before wicket before a run had been scored.
Hasan and Mohammad Amir did not concede a run off the bat until Amla clipped Hasan for four in the sixth over.
There were two crucial incidents with the total on 16, either of which could have swung the game in Pakistans favour.
Amla, on eight, was dropped by Fakhar Zaman at third slip off Hasan when he slashed hard at the ball, which flew at chest height to the fielder.
In the next over, Elgar, on four, edged new bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi low to first slip where Azhar Ali appeared to take a diving catch.
On-field umpires Bruce Oxenford and Sundaram Ravi conferred before referring to television umpire Joel Wilson with a soft signal of out, indicating they thought it was a clean catch.
After looking at several replays, including super-slow close-ups, Wilson ruled the ball had bounced and Elgar was reprieved.
The decision clearly astonished the Pakistan players and coach Mickey Arthur was seen leaving his place on the players balcony and going to the adjacent office of match referee David Boon.
Television commentator Michael Holding criticised his fellow West Indian Wilson.
Im convinced he was out, said Holding. I think the third umpire made a mistake. The protocol says you have got to be 100 percent sure the decision was wrong to change it.
In a similar situation, Indian captain Virat Kohli was given out in the recent second Test against Australia in Perth when television umpire Nigel Llong found no conclusive evidence to overturn a soft signal from the on-field umpires.
Elgar and Amla survived some testing bowling from the Pakistan seamers and gradually began to lift the scoring rate on a pitch which favoured bowlers throughout.
South African fast bowler Duanne Olivier was named man of the match for his match return of 11-96.
The second Test begins in Cape Town on January 3. AFP

World Cup and Ashes in 2019 :
A fantastic summer for English cricket in all forms
It is both glorious and bonkers, the cricketing summer to end all summers that will end either with unprecedented English success or crushing disappointment. Next year will see not only another Ashes series, but also a home World Cup that England are hot favourites to win.
What a feast of top quality cricket  in both Test and limited-overs formats  to look forward to, but what a concern it is too that the international calendar is now so crammed. The good news is that English cricket, without a big football tournament or Olympics to get in the way, should command maximum attention next summer. The bad is that elite cricketers are being pushed like never before, with the demands placed on them now at saturation point as the games greedy
administrators refuse to yield an inch in their relentless pursuit of as much money as they can muster.
The 2019 summer will not only see the domestic season beginning in April  earlier than ever  but also finds England in action as early as May 3 when they play a one-day international against Ireland in Dublin. From there it is straight to Cardiff for a Twenty20 international followed
by five 50-over games against Pakistan  Englands last chance for practice ahead of the World Cup they kick off on May 30 against South Africa at the Oval. Cricket has always made the mistake of making the World Cup too long and this one is no exception, even though the ICC have upset associate world nations by restricting it to just 10 teams.
If England get to the final they will play in what should be the games biggest showpiece occasion at Lords on July 14. There will barely be time for the open top bus parade before Joe Root and company will be donning whites and facing Ireland in a four-day Test starting just 10 days later.
Then comes the big one  with the first Ashes Test against Australia, probably including Steve Smith and David Warner returning after their bans, on August 1. The Ashes are not due to end until September 16 at the Oval.
Do not think there will then be a break either because England have not one, not two but three tours next winter to New Zealand, South Africa and Sri Lanka - and so it goes on.
Something has to give but you can be sure it will not be any of the lucrative T20 and T10 events that are springing up all over the world or even  most depressingly  the ECBs ill-considered new format The Hundred. The best players will not give up their extra money-making opportunities so governing bodies simply have to reduce the amount of international cricket. Sadly, they wont. However, its Christmas so lets be cheery. Cricket so often gives the impression it is doomed and desperate for a new audience, but it still has much to commend it. Next summer will show why it is still such a great game. I expect Eoin Morgan to lift the World Cup and Root to hold the urn before coach Trevor Bayliss rides off into a Sydney sunset with all the plaudits. Then we can all go and have a lie down.

Ferrari to celebrate Michael Schumachers 50th birthday with exhibition
Formula One legend Michael Schumacher will be honoured by Ferrari with a special exhibition to mark his 50th birthday on January 3, the Italian team confirmed on Monday.
Schumacher, a seven-time Formule One world champion, suffered severe head injuries in a skiing accident five years ago and has not been seen in public since.
The Michael 50 exhibition in the Ferrari Museum in Maranello will be run in association with the Keep Fighting Foundation launched two years ago by the Schumacher family.
It is intended both as a celebration and a mark of gratitude to the most successful Prancing Horse driver ever, Ferrari said in a statement.
Germanys Schumacher drove for the team from 1996 to 2006, winning five of his record seven drivers titles from 2000-2004.
Ferrari also won six constructors titles during his time with the team.
The exhibition will allow the public to discover the contribution that Schumacher made to the cars development as a driver and later as a consultant, Ferrari said.

Five things that have gone wrong for Manchester City
LONDON: English champions Manchester City slumped to a third shock defeat in four Premier League games at Leicester on Boxing Day to slip to third in the table and seven points adrift of unbeaten leaders Liverpool.
Just a few weeks ago City seemed unstoppable as they started their title defence with a 15-game unbeaten run.
However, a 2-0 reverse at Chelsea has sparked a run of three defeats in 18 days as Crystal Palace and Leicester both came from behind to hand Liverpool a huge advantage in the title race ahead of their trip to face City on January 3.
Here, AFP Sports looks at what has caused Citys sudden collapse:
FERNANDINHO IRREPLACEABLE
City coped admirably in Kevin De Bruynes absence for most of the campaign through injury thanks to an array of creative midfielders, but have badly missed Fernandinhos ability to play the more destructive role in midfield in the last two games.
The 33-year-old Brazilian had started every league game until Palaces visit on Saturday and is the one player in Citys squad without a natural replacement. Centre-back John Stones deputised at the weekend, while the more attack-minded Ilkay Gundogan was deployed at the base of the midfield in Leicester.
We have to try and find solutions. Ferna was not able to play because hes injured. We have to overcome this problem, said coach Pep Guardiola, who tried to sign Chelsea midfielder Jorginho from Napoli in the summer as cover for Fernandinho.
You have to think about how to solve it when you dont have players in a position.
FOUR COMPETITIONS TAKE THEIR TOLL
Even for a squad as deep as Citys, English footballs unique combination of a packed festive period and an extra cup competition can stretch resources.
Just eight days ago a strong City side beat a much-changed Leicester to reach the League Cup semi-finals and stay alive in four competitions.
Leicester boss Claude Puel claimed victory on Wednesday was vindication for his criticised team selection in the cup tie with the Foxes fresh to spring surprises over both Chelsea and City in the past five days.
As well as De Bruyne, Sergio Aguero didnt start against Chelsea or Palace due to injury, while David Silva has also been sidelined by injury in recent weeks.
MISSING MENDY
Left-back has also been a problem position, even as City enjoyed great success last season, due to Benjamin Mendys knee troubles.
The Frenchmans return to fitness and form in the early weeks of the season promised to give City an extra dimension to their attacking play, but he has been sidelined again since early November.
Fabian Delph, a central midfielder by trade, has filled in at left-back, but is now facing a three-match ban, including the Liverpool game, after being sent off late on at Leicester.
DEFENDING THE PREMIER LEAGUE DIFFICULT
Guardiola won three consecutive league titles at both Barcelona and Bayern Munich, but retaining the title in England has proved impossible for any team in the past decade.
A Manchester United side containing Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney were the last to do it in 2008/09.
Citys record haul of 100 points last season led many to believe they would buck that trend, but it is proving tougher than expected.
Last season, everyone said it was so easy, but I know how difficult it was, insisted Guardiola.
Last season we were so consistent and made a lot of points. They (Liverpool and Spurs) are both so consistent.
CAN CITY CHASE
The question remains whether a Guardiola side is capable of chasing down a title rival to win the league in the manner Alex Fergusons Manchester United made routine in the 1990s.
In most of Guardiolas seven title triumphs, his Barca, Bayern and City sides have been well in front by this stage of the season.
Now they have to play catch-up and their lack of reaction to going behind to Chelsea, Palace and Leicester leaves Citys mentality open to question.
We have to find an explanation, said Bernardo Silva. Its mathematically possible, but we have to be almost perfect from now. AFP

Following in the footsteps of Mandela and Lincoln
After the reactionary intervention to usurp power which was defeated by the progressive people and judicial power centres, there is general criticism that the two main parties in Lankas political arena  the UNP and the SLFP  have degenerated in both theory and practice. Though the criticism is formidable in the direction of the SLFP there is strong intellectual revulsion on UNP too. They say brilliant liberals as well as charged populist do not commit in to these two parties any more.
Further, each time they form new coalitions to accommodate the uncommitted, their identities and symbols are changed more frequently than their attire, the average voter is left so utterly confused. They may vote the wrong person say the new comers to politics. The UNP tried to keep the symbol steady while changing name. That too could have pushed out those who do not want to commit to UNP symbol. On the other hand because SLFP have not used hand symbol several decades consistently, it has virtually vanished into oblivion.
Modern liberalism and social democracy
Young UNPers firmly dispute the above opinion and say that there is serious attempt made by the leadership to train the new comers absorb modern liberalism and social democracy, and also to train in democratic practice. Apparently even outsiders interested in such programmes could participate.
It is a fact that there are modern civil society organisations backed by the West that involved in spreading democratic practice to handle the problems faced by Lanka. These organisations really show the power of social democracy in the western world more than the reactionary pressure of governments. Eran Wickramarathne, Vajira Abeywardane, Mangala Samaraweera, Harsha de Silva, and M. A. Sumanthiran, are some who benefited or contributed to these programmes. On the other hand populism of the SLFP has degenerated and having corrupted social welfare perspectives too, has become raw Sinhala fascism. In a recent Sama Samaja meeting Sumanthiran claimed their ideology is much closer Sama Samajism than any version of liberalism.
The JVP is doing well; carefully erasing and recovering from its notorious bloodthirsty anti-democratic reputation earned in the late 80s for which in spite ego has apologized indirectly. They have explained the mistake.
Correct direction
It is clear Anura Dissanayake and the new leadership has understood the nature of the crisis in democracy and JVP played a great role while keeping their independence. The TNA that has no chance in hell of ever forming a government; but it played a role of a political giant to move politics in correct direction. They have agreed to participate in a left political front.
Some say the future of our country is entirely in TNAs hands!
If that happens one can be assured that the crme of patriotic professionals and workers with integrity to come together to be the leaders of that force. Those who have so far refrained from entering the currently vile political arena will not hesitate to join this movement. All those true patriots of Lanka irrespective of nationality: Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim will back this movement to the hilt.
That is most probable; one can assure oneself!
These ethical committed young politicians are ONLY hope to take our country out of this dark abyss we are spiraling into and take it forward towards a better future. They owe it to us and the future generations of Lanka.
These young leaders are currently in their 50s, maximum.
Hence they have to do it NOW before its too late, because if they dont, no one else may succeed.
If this is the reality, some critiques say, the time has come for one to break away from the politically bankrupt parties one presently belongs to, and become NOT the 3rd force but the first and MAIN political force in Lanka that could push present Ranil regime to follow Lincoln of America if not Nelson Mandela of South Africa.

Global outlook 2018
This year is actually not over yet, but with just a couple of days to go before 2019 dawns, the time is right to look back on an eventful year on many fronts. Migration is perhaps the biggest story of 2018 and we focused on that exclusively in this space yesterday. But the next biggest story is no less important and has even been identified as a cause for migration itself  Climate Change.
The emission of the heat-trapping gases that produce Climate Change continues to rise globally. A report released by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in October 2018 says we may have only 12 years to act or pass the point of no return. To judge by the hurricanes, devastating wildfires, floods, and record-breaking heat in 2018 that Climate Change fueled, our descendants will inherit an Earth on the verge of becoming hell. We have experienced many freak weather events in Sri Lanka. Although some natural disasters cannot be directly linked to Climate Change, there were many of them this year  including two massive tsunamis in Indonesia. One major problem is that Climate Change deniers are a very powerful group and could derail efforts to save the world.
Bad news generally gets a lot of press, but good things happen too. North and South Korea are (literally) mending fences at a remarkable pace, perhaps spurred on by a landmark summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. The two countries even held a ceremony this week to formally link their railway systems, but it could be blocked by sanctions imposed on North Korea. In Africa, Ethiopia and former foe Eritrea (they were at war for 12 years until 2000) signed a peace deal that has seen the resumption of diplomatic relations and commercial air traffic between Addis Ababa and Asmara. Talking of air traffic, this year was an exceptional one for civil aviation with four billion passengers carried and only a few major accidents, most notably the crash of a brand new Lion Air Boeing 737 Max 8 in Indonesia a few weeks ago.
Good things can happen out of bad experiences too. The #MeToo Movement, spurred by the case of Harvey Weinstein went global this year, with thousands of women coming forward with similar tales. In Italy the movement became #Quella Volta Che (that time when), in Spain it is #Yo Tambien, in France it is #Balance Ton Porc (squeal on your pig), and in Arab-speaking countries it is #Ana Kaman. Several high-profile men faced jail as allegations against them were proved beyond doubt. The Movement has gained momentum throughout the year and even figured in the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh in USA.
The murder of Washington Post journalist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul sent shockwaves throughout the world. The incident soured relations between the West and Saudi Arabia, which finally admitted that Khashoggi has indeed been murdered and arrested 15 of the men implicated by the Turkish authorities. He was not the only journalist killed this year  more than 50 journalists were killed in the line of duty around the world while a few others were killed in attacks not specifically targeted at journalists. Journalism is becoming a deadlier business in many parts of the world, but we hope 2019 will be a better year for the scribes.
Scribes around the world were perplexed by events happening in the UK, where confusion reigns over Brexit  exit from the European Union. A Deal with the EU Or is it a No Deal divorce Many have criticized Prime Minister Theresa Mays Brexit plans and there are growing calls for a second peoples referendum to at least decide on the framework of the divorce terms, if not the original question of whether to leave the EU at all. But to many outside observers, Brexit increasingly looks like a bad choice that will leave the UK worse off.
This year saw the election of many new leaders around the world, from Mexico (Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador) to Maldives (Ibrahim Solih). And the entire world condoled when Americas elder statesman George H.W. Bush departed at the age of 94. He died just weeks after Senator John McCain (80), a celebrated war hero.
One growing trend in world politics is the rise of political populism, ethnic extremism and diplomatic isolation. From Hungary to Italy, many leaders have assumed an openly hostile attitude towards immigrants and minorities. In France, Emmanuel Macron faced tough times with the Yellow Vest movement turning into a much bigger phenomenon. In Germany, Angela Merkel is ready to bow out and a replacement (Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer or AKK) has already been named. Not surprisingly, it is the US that grabbed the most headlines this year, with President Trump heading into another controversial year with the recent resignation of Defence Secretary James Mad Dog Mattis and legal action against some of his close associates. The next year indeed looks more challenging for leaders around the world.
