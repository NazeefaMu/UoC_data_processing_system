2nd ODI: Boult destroys Windies
CHRISTCHURCH, Saturday: New Zealand warned the West Indies they are targeting a series sweep after Trent Boult bagged a career-best seven wickets in their record 204-run victory in the second ODI in Christchurch on Saturday.
It was New Zealands biggest ever ODI defeat of the West Indies and gave them an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the current three-match series after winning the first match by five wickets.
Tom Latham, filling in as captain while Kane Williamson is rested, said there would be no easing up in the final ODI on Tuesday.
Boult took seven for 34 as the West Indies folded at Hagley Oval for 121 in reply to New Zealands substantial 325 for six. Boult had three for six after his first three overs as the West Indies fell apart at the start of their innings.
After he finished off the top order, Lochie Ferguson plucked out the middle with three wickets in 10 deliveries, including Jason Mohammed and Rovman Powell with successive balls.
It was then left to Boult to return and clean up the tail.
New Zealand, sent into bat first, received a flying start from George Worker and Colin Munro who reached 50 off 40 deliveries before Sheldon Cottrell removed Munro (30) and his replacement Neil Broom (six) in quick succession. Worker, dropped on seven, progressed to 58 for his second successive half century against the West Indies.
Ross Taylor posted 58 and with his departure New Zealand were five for 186 leaving Nicholls and Astle to build the formidable target.
Nicholls 83 came off 62 balls and included two sixes and seven fours, while Astle faced 45 deliveries for his 49 but only reached the boundary three times. For the West Indies, Cottrell took three for 62.
The West Indies struggled throughout their reply with Shai Hopes 23 their best performance with the bat.

Maya Senanayake
Woman for all seasons
Mothers come in all shapes and sizes, and mine came as a package of innumerable talents and ideals.
She combined the tenacity of her father who, from a village boy, became arguably one of Sri Lankas foremost mathematical minds and the adventurism of an English mother who made this country her home due to her life-long commitment to education.
Living with educationist parents meant she moved with them, and her life was built around schools. Starting with Ananda Collegewhere she was, at the time of her passing, the oldest old girlto a myriad other institutions that her parents chose to establish or uplift. I remember her constant complaint that they would mark her papers down purposely to show there was no favouritism.
What was most impressive was how she threw herself into her interests with huge commitmentsewing like a professional, knitting all our so-called Nuwaera Eliya clothes, crocheting her own designs and even mastering the complex lace pillow. When it came to batik, she taught herself enough to make her own clothes, and during her pottery stage, pieces of unique design would appear in her whatnot duly-signed and dated at the bottom.
In sports, she was equal to any task: she played a mean game of tennis often with the love of her life, my father, and rode horses and competed in swimming with equal aplomb.
Badminton, Table tennis Bring it on, she would say, and would display her fierce competitiveness with no quarter given. Being a police officers wife immediately made her a fan of all the forces teams, and her particular favourite was rugby. Here, she would cast aside the polite reserve of an IGPs wife to boisterously cheer the team from the front-row seats.
Her four boys and husband would cower when she would loudly question the referees decision and look to us for support.
Pragmatism and multi-tasking were words invented for her: all decisions had to be well-thought out, practical and self-sustaining. So it seemed the natural thing to do when she launched a factory to tailor police uniforms that employed only policemens children and wives. Such was also the case when she embarked on building a three-storey building as president of the All Ceylon Womens Buddhist Congress and a training bakery, accommodation for its female trainees and a retail outlet to cover the relevant expenses.
These and many other positions she held in benevolent organisation came at a price as her no-nonsense approach was not appreciated by allthough in hindsight, they all agree she had the best interest of those bodies at heart. Then there was Maya, the businesswomen. Accepting the challenge to manage the printing press that was producing my grandfathers standard-issue school books at the time, she managed a team of sixty employees whilst balancing the care of her four boys and a husband whose career was progressing rapidly.
As the self-reliant person she was, she drove her trusted Morris station wagon herself, not hesitating to admonish any motorist who crossed her path.
Amidst all this, we saw a mother to whom family meant everythingnot in a spoiling or passive sense, but one who encouraged and guided. She taught us to be practical, but at the same time, hugs and kisses were there in plenty. Every birthday cake, every big match outfit, every cricket match my brothers played were considered personal duties by her; the quintessential daughter, wife and mother.
As her 91st birth anniversary draws near, it is hard to accept that she is gone, but in her own words, her work here is done.

Alec Robertson
Propagator of the Dhamma
It has been 15 years since Alec Robertsonpreacher, writer and broadcaster of the Dhamma and one-time Member of Parliamentpassed away.
Alec Robertson was born in Gampola on October 30, 1928, and died on the last day of 2002, at the age of 74. His working life was dedicated mainly to the Buddhist causepropagating the Dhamma through talks, discussions, books, and articles to Buddhist journals and newspapers. One of his most significant contributions was the popularisation of the weekly Dhamma discussions in English at Maitri Hall, Lauries Road, Bambalapitiya. He was closely associated with the Servants of the Buddha Society, which has conducted Buddhist discussions on Saturday evenings for almost half a century. He started taking part in these meetings while he was still at school. He became the societys Assistant Secretary when he was just 21 years. Later, he became secretary, and served as president for an uninterrupted 30 years, from 1969.
He relinquished this office only when he realised that declining health would not permit him to discharge the duties of this office effectively. But he continued to be associated with the society as its adviser until his demise.
His voice and personality reverberated in the Maitri Hall, where he chaired the societys meetings and gave a Dhamma talk every first Saturday of the month. When the scheduled speaker could not turn up, Alec Robertson would give the talk himself, often asking the audience to suggest a topic.
Robertson had a prodigious memory. His knowledge of the Dhamma was extensive, based on his studies of Pali, the Dhamma, the Abhidhamma, and commentaries, as well as through his association with Buddhist scholars, monks, and laymen. Robertson was also for many years associated with broadcasting, giving Dhamma talks on the radio and participating in Dhamma radio discussions. For several decades he participated in one of the most popular Buddhist radio programmes at that time, namely, the Buddhist Forum. In this forum, a number of Buddhist scholars discuss various aspects of the Dhammaand entertain subjects for discussions from listeners. Participants in this forum apart from Robertson included at that time the late S. R. Wijayatilake, a former Judge of the Supreme Court and the late Austin De Silva, a dedicated Buddhist worker. Robertson became the chairman of the Buddhist Forum later and continued to perform the task, except for brief intervals, until his death, a period of two and half a decades.
As a writer, Robertson had many Buddhist publications to his credit. These include the
Buddhist Attitude To Christianity,
Nibbana  Happiness Supreme,
The Triple Gem and the Uposatha, and
Buddha, the Healer Incomparable. He also regularly contributed articles to the newspapers, Buddhist journals and the Buddhist annual, Vesak Sirisara.
Although known largely as a promoter of the Dhamma among English-speaking people, Alec Robertson also had a good command of the Sinhala language. As a young man he travelled to different parts of the country giving talks, usually in Sinhala, at the invitation of Buddhist organisations in the outstations. He strived at all times to share his knowledge about the latent power held within the human mind. His messages were directed at awakening people to recognize this great untapped and unseen capacity within them and to introduce the teachings of the Dharma as the path to greater self-awareness. Robertson pursued his mission in life with determination, courage, and commitment. May his onward journey in Samsara be smooth and brief, and may he realise early the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.

Ashes gone, pride at stake for wounded England at MCG
MELBOURNE: England have lost paceman Craig Overton and may make a further change as they try to restore some pride in Tuesday's fourth Melbourne Test after surrendering the Ashes to Australia.
It's been a tour from hell for Joe Root's beleaguered team, succumbing to three heavy defeats which rendered the last two Tests in Melbourne and Sydney dead rubbers. Root has been in the eye of the storm over the tourists' underwhelming efforts, with former Australia captain Ricky Ponting deriding him as a little boy who has been a bit soft during the one-sided series.
Several other under-performing senior players, notably Alastair Cook, Stuart Broad and Moeen Ali, have also been under the gun as some critics call for their axing.
Overton was ruled out on Sunday with a rib injury, with either Tom Curran or Mark Wood likely to replace him, while young leg-spinner Mason Crane is pushing for a Test debut.
England and Wales Cricket Board chief Tom Harrison typified the feelings inside the team when he said earlier in the week: I don't think this is the moment for rash decisions. Wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow has called on his teammates to rally behind their under-fire skipper.
We don't just owe him (Root), we owe ourselves as well, Bairstow said. We've got to go out there and try and win both of these Test matches.
Phenomenal form
Talking is one thing, doing is another for England, who have had their moments in the series but have been blown away by big losses -- 10 wickets in Brisbane, 120 runs in Adelaide and an innings and 41 runs in Perth.
Cook, who became the first Englishman to play 150 Tests during the series, has scored just 83 runs in six innings, while Root has two half-centuries but only a total of 176 runs at 29.33.
In comparison, Australia skipper Steve Smith is in cracking form and is coming off a Test-best 239 in the third Test. He is averaging 142 for the series.
Smith's phenomenal form has him in rarefied company, occupying joint second position in the ICC's all-time rankings list along with England's Len Hutton and behind only the legendary Don Bradman.
Smith has a career average of 62.32 from 59 Tests, second only to Bradman's pinnacle 99.94.
The Australian skipper is gunning for his fourth consecutive Melbourne Test century after hundreds against Pakistan, the West Indies and India in the last three Boxing Day showpieces.
There will be some respite for England, with Australian pace spearhead Mitchell Starc ruled out on Sunday with a bruised heel and replaced by Jackson Bird. But Smith has vowed no let-up in short-pitched bowling against England's tailenders, despite claims the umpires should give the lower order more protection.
We obviously had a plan from the start of the series that we were going to bowl a lot of short stuff to those guys, much like we did back in 2013, Smith said in the past week.
Australia have won half of the 56 Tests played at the vast MCG, although England won there in 1998 and 2010.
Cricket Australia chief executive James Sunderland said the Boxing Day crowd was likely to surpass the 91,112 that made Ashes history in 2013-14 even though England had already lost the series.
Teams (probable): Australia - David Warner, Cameron Bancroft, Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith (capt), Shaun Marsh, Mitchell Marsh, Tim Paine, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan Lyon, Jackson Bird.
England - Alastair Cook, Mark Stoneman, James Vince, Joe Root (capt), Dawid Malan, Jonny Bairstow, Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Tom Curran/Mark Wood, Stuart Broad, James Anderson.

## Title: Ashwin working on new variation ahead of SA tour

Ashwin working on new variation ahead of SA tour
In a bid to reclaim his spot in the Indian limited-overs sides, after having been overlooked in recent times, Ravichandran Ashwin has begun developing yet another variation which he intends to unveil when India embark on their tour of South Africa in January.
Ashwin, one of the best exponents of off-spin on the planet, plans to add leg-spin to his arsenal as well ahead of the Test series in South Africa. With an action resembling Indian legend Anil Kumble's, Ashwin was seen fine-tuning his new variation in a VAP Trophy match against Grand Slam on Thursday.
Ashwin last played for India in an ODI way back in June, against the West Indies. While he has notched 150 wickets in the format, his struggles with the white ball are well-documented and he recently lost his place to Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal.
Ashwin delivered six overs of leg-spin in the game against Grand Slam, picking up two wickets in the process. Starting off his spell with his traditional off-spinners, the 31-year-old soon changed his method of attack, after just three overs. He was able to extract quite a lot of purchase from the wicket, with his turn and bounce becoming quite tricky to handle in the end. Despite bowling to top-quality batsmen in N Jagadeesan and Bharghav Merai, Ashwin was able to deliver nine economical overs in total.
I knew Ashwin was working on leg spin. He was discussing it during the Ranji nets. He did bowl the odd leggie against Andhra and Mumbai. I had kept wickets for him. But his accuracy is excellent, Jagadeesan said to Times of India after the match.
He bowled googlies and executed the faster one with good control. As a batsman, you can't get away from him. His height is an advantage and he did generate bounce, he added.
Ashwin is hoping to perfect his new skill before the South Africa series that begins January 5. A mainstay in the Indian Test setup, the offie will be eager to return to the limited-overs sides now that he has a whole new ace up his sleeve.
Ashwin is already armed with a number of variations and none of them seem to work in the shorter formats of the game. Even if his all-new leg-spin is on the money in the Test series against the Proteas, it is unlikely he will make a return to the ODI or T20I side seeing the amount of success Kuldeep and Chahal have had in the past year or so.

## Title: Christmas according to Matthew and Luke

Christmas according to Matthew and Luke
Obviously, the most eye-catching item at Christmas is the crib. Children love to make it or buy one. But, are we aware of the fact that a traditional crib is an amalgamation of two Christmas stories
St. Francis of Assisi is said to have made the first imitational crib with life-size statues.
The Christmas stories or the infancy narratives occur only in the Gospels according to Saints Matthew and Luke.
The story and the theological message of Matthew differ drastically from Luke. They write to two different communities and thus their messages and characters highlighted in their stories differ accordingly.
Shepherds do not appear in the Gospel of Matthew while the Magi are absent in Luke.
The Christmas liturgy presents the Matthean version of the Christmas story on the vigil of Christmas on the eve of December 24. The Christmas Masses at midnight and at dawn on December 25 proclaim the Lukan perspective of the Christmas with two subsequent parts related only to the shepherds.
The Matthean Christmas message
The Matthean Gospel is supposedly written to a predominantly Jewish readership.
Thus he begins with a genealogy of Jesus that highlights Abraham, the divinely-chosen forefather of the Jewish Race and the great King David to whose dynasty was promised the Messiah bearing the symbolic name of Emmanuel as was also prophesied by Isaiah (7:14) about 600 years before the birth of Jesus.
Thus Matthew points out to the doubtful Jews that the baby born is a true and noble Jew: a true descendant of Abraham and David and they are related to Lord Jesus through the foster parenthood of Joseph, the husband of Mary.
The Emmanuel prophecy in the infancy narrative is the basis of the central theme of the Gospel of Matthew as it occurs at the beginning (1:23), in the middle (18:20) and at the end (28:20) of the Gospel.
Etymologically it refers to the fact God has come to our midst from heaven to be with us forever.
Why does Matthew opt to speak of the Magi and the plot of King Herod the Great It points to the future destiny of the Infant Jesus.
While the chosen race of the Jews have rejected their Messiah, the less favoured Gentiles have come to accept and adore the babe as their true Lord, God and King as symbolised by their gifts. The chosen race has rejected their true King and Saviour as an infant through King Herod and as an adult through their religious and political leadership.
The Lukan Christmas message
Lukes main message is reflected in the angelic announcement to the shepherds keeping their night watch over their flocks in the fields: For today in the city of David a saviour has been born for you who is Messiah and Lord (2:11).
The Holy Land of Israel was under the Roman imperial rule. The Roman emperor was to be addressed by the citizens as the worlds saviour and lord. The application of these titles to Lord Jesus now emphasises the fact that Jesus is the true Saviour of the world and its Lord. In addition, the contemporary world history adds to the historical factuality of Lord Jesus birth.
The title Messiah is addressed to the Jews and it invites them to acknowledge the infant as their long-expected Messiah.
Luke makes it a point to cite the place the baby was laid in, wrapped in swaddling clothes reminiscent of King Solomon  a manger. Jesus now lies in a manger not only as a rejected poor child but also as the life-giving true food of humanity.
The central characters in the Lukan infancy narrative are the shepherds.
What is their theological significance Adult Jesus solidarity with the poor and the social outcasts is a major Lukan theme.
Thus in the body of the Gospel Luke speaks of sinners, tax-collectors, women, Samaritans who were rejected or oppressed by the Jewish society but loved and associated by the adult Jesus. Thus, Luke wants to highlight the fact that this tendency was present even at the birth of Jesus. The shepherds who were poor and social outcasts were welcomed as the first visitors to the Infant Jesus.
In todays context
What messages can we derive from Matthew and Luke when they are treated separately Matthew speaks of the rejection of Jesus by the chosen race. As Christians, we are the chosen of Lord Jesus now. How do we respond to our Christian calling vis--vis the new converts to Christian fundamentalist sects How fervent are these new converts in their faith! On the other hand, how lukewarm are we, waiting for the constant push of our pastors and ready to leave the Church at the least mistake by them Reflecting on the Lukan perspective, how much are we in solidarity with the poor and the social outcasts whom we meet daily - Messenger

Christmas brings about renewal in our lives
It is the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem that we celebrate during Christmas. It is God's entry into human history in the person of Jesus, the saviour of the world. In this mystery of the incarnation, God revealed to us the depths of his love for humankind. God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so that whosoever believes in him may not perish, but have eternal life. (John 3: 16). Thus, Christmas is the manifestation of God's unfathomable love for us, said Rev. Dr. J. Winston S. Fernando, S.S.S. and President and Rt. Rev. Dr. D.Valence Mendis, Secretary General of the Catholic Bishops Conference in Sri Lanka, in a release.
The release added: Jesus has shown us that by his coming into our midst, he wants us to share in the fullness of life which God alone can give. He wants us to live our lives as meaningful as possible in this world and then enter into his divine life for all eternity.
In the celebration of this mystery of Incarnation, Jesus invites all of us to come to experience this fullness of life he offers. Hence, our celebration of Christmas cannot and should not be a mere recalling of a past event. At Christmas, Jesus encounters us and invited us to recognize him, thereby, bringing about a renewal in our lives.
Therefore, Christmas reminds us of the need to invite Jesus into our live, our families and our society. This simple birth in a stable in Bethlehem has a radical call towards conversion so that we would be more sensitive to the needs of others and specially the poor and the marginalized.
The Holy Father Pope Francis reminds us of this need by declaring a special day every year, at the threshold of the season of advent, as a Universal day of the Poor. This call of the Holy Father has great relevance for us to look for those who are materially poor and open our eyes to the sufferings around us. We need to be considerate also towards those who are spiritually poor and those families, youth and the children who need more compassionate pastoral care. Christmas urges us to go still further and be mindful of the circumstances and the unjust structures that keep the poor always poor.
Let us be mindful of the disturbing levels of disregard towards the immeasurable value of life. The incarnation of Jesus shows us how precious human life is. Indeed our God took the human form and dwelt among us, showing us the sacredness of life. As Christians, we believe that life begins at the moment of conception, therefore, destroying the unborn children is a blatant rejection of the will of the creator. We cannot justify abortion which is intrinsically evil.
Let us commit ourselves to changing all that is not in keeping with God's holy will in our midst by becoming agents of peace, harmony, and reconciliation. As we given thanks to God for the beautiful gift of Jesus, let us pray that all of us be renewed by the spirit to be living witnesses of Jesus, especially to bring about lasting peace and reconciliation in our country.
Let us strive to become agents of mercy and reconciliation even in the little ways we can, as we celebrate Christmas this Year.
We wish all our faithful, our fellow citizens, and all men and women of goodwill a blessed Christmas!

CHRISTMAS MESSAGES
Help the needy, helpless - Cardinal
It was to bring the message of humbleness that Jesus Christ decided to be born in a manager. Therefore let us resolve to extend love and compassion to needy people leading helpless lives and children undergoing untold suffering during this Christmas,Colombo Archbishop His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith said in a special Christmas message.
Let us honour others. Love peoples lives and share our happiness and joy with others eschewing selfishness. Let us remember that mans value depended on his conduct rather than on his riches and material possessions.
While enjoying Christmas, I request you to desist from causing destruction to the environment and using polythene for decorations.
In the name of Jesus Christ, I request you to honour children and uplift them with love and care and desist from causing harm to them whoever they many be because that is the best sacrifice you could make in the name of child Jesus Christ.
Wish you a Merry Christmas. May the blessings of Jesus Christ he with you, the Cardinal said.
A reunion of powerful divinity and the fragile humanity
President Maithripala Sirisena extended his warmest greetings for a happy Christmas to all Christians who are devoted heirs of this magnificent universal festivity.
Christmas has often been depicted as a reunion of powerful divinity and the fragile humanity.
That glorious reunion occurred with the coming of a religious leader who instilled the values of love, sacrifice and justice in the society, marking a significant victory of humanity in its history that is millennia old, the President said in his Christmas day wishes.
The birth of Jesus Christ and his rise as a religious leader contrasted with the backdrop of inequality and brutality that was the order of the day. It was to cleanse the world of those degenerate values that Jesus Christ was born in the human world, and experienced the full range of human emotions and sufferings. Through this sacrifice, mankind reminded itself of the gravity of human existence and the unassailable values of humanity.
Today, as the human race faces unprecedented challenges, the Christian belief undoubtedly proves to be a guiding star for us to find enduring solutions. It is when one starts to love oneself and then spread that love and kindness towards others that humanity will ultimately pave the way for lasting peace and reconciliation. Overcoming the multitude of challenges that threaten humanity can only be achieved through such a collective journey.
May the silver bells of such sincere beliefs be heard all over the world this Christmas!
I wish all Christians in Sri Lanka and around the world a merry Christmas filled with joy and prosperity, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
Spirit of Christmas shared universally - PM
Christians in Sri Lanka and all over the world rejoice at Christmas which celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in a Christmas message.
The message adds: The spirit of Christmas is shared universally and is a time to spread the goodwill, love and joy that the birth of Christ brings.
Born in a Manger to parents from a humble background, Jesus Christ brought equality, compassion and fellowship to mankind. He chose to set the captives free from social injustice and their mental, physical and spiritual burdens.
Today, we live in a society that seeks freedom from tyranny and injustice, stigma and prejudice. One in which people will be free from religious and ethnic strife, able to live together in harmony and a spirit of tolerance.
The Holy Bible tells us that good trees bear good fruit; an outpouring of goodness in our hearts can help us find the good in others.May you have a blessed Season of Goodwill that truly celebrates the birth of the Prince of Peace.

Christmas: Myth vs. Mystery
Taken on a global scale, Christmas has been transformed very much to our regret into a cultural and social festival caricatured by media and commercialism and as such every year with the onslaught of technology and incredible advertisement industrys avalanche world-wide, it risks rapidly losing its inner Christian, spiritual and religious depth-meaning. While a legitimate external manifestation of this Christian celebration is permissible, it should not be allowed to overshadow the spiritual experiences that are most essential to this centuries-old traditional Christian celebration.
Christians all over the world are proud that Christmas marks the end of a passing year and ushers in as well a brand new year  an year of newer and fresher opportunities to live their faith intensely and thus become a source of blessing to the world. They are happy to inherit the beatitude of the Mount in which the feet of those who come over the mountains announcing peace are really blessed and that peace-makers would be called the children of God. It was to enhance this hope that Blessed Pope Paul VI inspired by the encyclical Peace on earth of Pope St. John XXIII and with reference to his own encyclical Progress of Peoples, established in 1967 the Catholic World Day of Peace dedicated to universal peace, to be held each year on January 1st, the feast of Mary, the Mother of God. January 2018 will mark its 40th anniversary.
Commercialism robs Christmas of its meaning, radically turning it into a secular festival, The Christmas Season begins in certain countries as early as September with streets being lit with neon-lights, windows in dazzling dcor and with shops and super-markets abounding in goods of all kinds: clothes, utensils, furniture and foods. The secular world believes that the more these material aspects are spectacular, the happier Christmas season would turn out to be. It is the time for sales and mega-profits. It is reported that the hawkers of Pettah have a field-day during the time of Christmas and they rake in profits by the thousands. Secularising Christmas into trade and merry-making creates of it an idol thus creating a new idolatry and a simony which is turning a sacred thing into something worldly.
This is a manifestation of the Christmas Myth. It was the same milieu that filled Bethlehem, the blessed night the worlds redeemer was born in that royal city of David. It does not really matter the particular day or the particular place where Jesus Christ was born. We might not be able to fix it historically. What we celebrate is the memory of this unique one-time event which Christians identify as a truth of Faith, the Incarnation of the Word, the second Person of the Blessed Trinity born as a human being in the historical person of Jesus of Nazareth who happens to be the Eternal Galilean. His memory has penetrated the last 20 centuries across continents, cultures and civilisations.
A Pentecost of languages across the world call on Him for divine intervention: forgiveness of sin and for the peace that He alone can give and the world cannot. He is hailed as the Light of Nations as Vatican II proclaims and the first evangeliser that brought to us the Good News of Gods unconditional love for mankind which had strayed from the dawn of creation.
Jesus through His Church, is still feeding the hungry, healing the sick and driving away the demons that put to rack and ruin the lives of modern man. There has never been a period in history that saw principalities and powers of darkness wreaking disasters and destruction over mankind, as the present age we live in. The incredible advances in science and technology are finding themselves poorer in stemming this tide of tragedies and catastrophe. The ever noble sciences of humanities have buckled down in the face of this tsunami of modernity that promises only a life of comfort, pleasure and enjoyment of a temporal nature to modern man. Through this surreptitious enemy of mans mind and spirit, he has succumbed to ever greater and lamentable ignorance of deeper values that bring meaning to life.
Christmas immerses us in the world of the reality of the Incarnation of the Word of God, furlongs away from a mythical and trivialized perception that will alienate this mystery from our celebrations. It is said by scholars that the sacred is so mysterious, though real, that we need myths (stories), rituals and rites in our efforts to express it. So, the latter are only a poor means to capture the reality and the depth of the mystery involved. Religion needs mystery and corresponding stories to express itself. After all, didnt Jesus Himself use simple stories called Parables to reveal the immensely profound inner spiritual meaning of the Kingdom of God that He came to reveal and sacrifice Himself for! Look at the most touching stories of the Prodigal Son which describes the conversion of a sinner but is seen as a penitent return to his fathers home that makes the father exult in joy! Read the story of the Good Samaritan who enacts the drama of Christian charity towards a helpless victim no matter what religion or race or culture the victim happens to belong. What about the image of Jesus as the Good Shepherd who goes after the lost sheep and when found, hoists him on His shoulders and dances for joy. So we have in God, a feasting Father and a dancing Shepherd!
In the same vein we have the Christmas stories of the two Gospel-writers, Matthew and Luke who look at the event of the Birth of Jesus Christ from different angles and strive to present it to the two different kinds of communities they encountered when they began evangelising the Jews and the Greeks. Matthew is more doctrinal placing the Christmas story in the context of the fulfillment of the great Messianic prophecies and hopes that were uttered hundreds of years ago by their religious teachers and sages, the prophets. Luke on the other hand is down to earth perceiving the Birth of Christ as a poor One amidst the poor. His approach is more human and concrete.
Look at the Magnificat that extols the poor and praises God who does mighty things for His chosen ones. It is a hymn that sings about human liberation and justice for the lowly who are exalted, with those in power thrown down from their worldly thrones. The socially marginalised shepherds are great actors in the drama of Bethlehem. To them is announced by the angelic host the Birth of the Messiah of the poor, laid in a manger surrounded by cattle. But, He is Christ the Lord! They go into ecstasy seeing the Babe wrapped up in swaddling clothes. Jesus Himself, though a carpenter, chooses the image of the shepherd to identify Himself! Shepherds work hard, lead their sheep in the hot sun covering distances looking for rich pasture to feed their flock. They break rest and watch their flocks by night, alert to any danger that might befall them.
Jesus considers His followers as sheep and friends who have to be loved by those to whom they are entrusted, like Peter. With them He had shared the secrets of the Kingdom of God which he came to announce and inaugurate. Though born in a cattle-shed and refused all shelter, security and comfort, He reigns from His Cross that won Him a Risen and glorious presence. The whole cosmos will genuflect before this Risen One and proclaim Him Lord, says St. Paul, a great protagonist who counted himself accursed if he did not proclaim this crucified and risen Christ!
This is the mystery that began with historys first Christmas night in Bethlehem: witnessed by Mary Immaculate, Joseph the just man, the shepherds and of course the three kings who came with gifts guided by the mysterious star in the East. These gifts too symbolised the mystery shrouding this wonder-child: He will be a suffering Messiah but a royal One. Much of what happened in His life was a mystery even to His mother Mary and we are told that she pondered over them in her heart prayerfully: the birth in the manger, the exile into Egypt, Simeons startling prophecy, his being lost at the temple and the tragic events on Calvary.
Christmas therefore challenges us not to turn it into a myth, giving into exaggerated exterior glitter and reveling, turning it into a pagan festival. We are dealing with the august mystery of Christmas which is the Incarnation of the Son of God. Instead this celebration must be done devoutly and soberly experiencing the depths of the mystery that took place in human history two thousand years ago. The Babe of Bethlehem is Gods love written in human language. It is the bounden duty of all Christians, to ward off the paganising trends of this celebration, which make of it an idol in the claws of a secular culture. - Messenger

CKDu Care project helps kidney disease patients
CKDu CARE is a project, dedicated to relief service, education and research on Chronic Kidney Disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka.
It has been initiated by a group of Western qualified and Ayurveda qualified medical professionals.The Institute of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine (IAAM), Kotelawala Defence University (KDU),the Kebithigollewa Divisional Secretariat and the Department of Ayurveda North Central Province support this project.
A CKDu dedicated clinic has begun at the Kebithigollewa divisional secretariat office premises in October 2015. As of October 2016 the clinic shifted to the Ayurveda community health center of the area as requested by the Ayurveda Commissioner of the North Central Province. The project is designed to provide a free service for CKD patients of which a majority represents the low income farming community.
Native medicine revealed by late Ven. Waharaka Abhayarathanalankara thera a renowned and veteran indigenous Ayurvedic physician are being practiced applied and used for remedying the renal patients.
So far 32 clinics have been conducted managing over 400 registered patients under its care and with a clinic attendance of 100-150 patients per clinic.
Services provided through the project include medical examination of patients by qualified Western and Ayurveda physicians. Laboratory testing for evaluation of CKD status including blood creatinine, urinary albumin creatinine is conducted free. A customised medication pack for three weeks is then provided based on patient status.
Health education sessions are conducted for all patients attending the clinic emphasizing on good agricultural practices (highlighting significance of agrochemical free agriculture), food habits and life style modifications essential for prevention of CKDu.
CKDu CARE has also successfully conducted a knowledge and skill-sharing workshop for Ayurveda physicians who treat CKDu patients in the north central province. This five-day workshop was conducted at the Ayurveda Teaching Hospital Anuradhapura.
This workshop covered aspects of essential basic knowledge and skills with regard to clinical management, preparation of simple traditional medicine remedies for CKDu using ingredients abundantly found in northern Sri Lanka as well as systematic data recording in CKDu clinics. Training was provided for over 20 government Ayurveda doctors who also underwent an onsite clinical training at the CKDuCARE clinic, Kebithigollewa. Now they are ready to provide comprehensive health care for CKDu patients using Western - Ayurveda integrated method. Some medicines for CKDu are now been prepared at the Ayurveda medicine manufacturing plant at Thambuttegama Thelhiriyawa under the purview of commissioner Ayurveda North Central Province, using the ancient prescriptions donated by Dr. Nishantha Kumarasinghe for providing medical treatments for a larger section of the kidney patients.
It is envisaged to treat the CKDupatients with this course of native medicine through the 45 ayurvedha hospitals in the NCP.
A decline in serum creatinine level (a measure of degree of kidney injury) has been reported in over 70% of patients under treatment. A considerable proportion (30%) hasalso demonstrated normal levels of creatinine following a 6month to 9 month duration of treatment.These remarkable outcomes have been shared with the scientific community
So far research on CKDu conducted locally as well as internationally has failed to present any fruitful outcomes. The aim of CKDu CARE research is to find a feasible solution to CKDu using a Western and Ayurveda integrated approach. The young researchers working with CKDu CARE are systematically recording data of patients covering biological, psychological, socio-demographic and environmental aspects of their lives.
These data together with our remarkable findings are being presented to the national and international forums in order to create awareness among the scientific community who has similar intention to find a solution for this seemingly incurable disease. More in-depth research such as 2 PhD researches projects and 08 undergraduate research projectswill be carried out with the support from the university of Sri Jayewardenepura (R 4 million grant has been approved for one project), National Science Foundation for which grant application forwarded, National Research Council Kothalawala Defence University and Institute of Ayurvedha and Alternative Medicine.
Dr. Kumarasinghe said this volunteer medical care project has achieved a lot for a period of one year from its start in October 2015 without seeking funding or any major support from the government.

Dhoni to continue till 2019 World Cup  Indian chief selector
MUMBAI, Saturday - Chairman of selectors MSK Prasad on Saturday made it clear that Mahendra Singh Dhoni is set to continue till the 2019 World Cup as some of the younger keepers, who have been tried, have not performed on expected lines.
Prasad's views seemed to suggest that Delhi captain Rishabh Pant has now fallen off the radar quite sharply with the second keeper in limited overs being 32-year-old Dinesh Karthik.
Asked if they are looking at Dhoni on a series by series basis, Prasad said: We are grooming some wicketkeepers during India A tours. But more or less, we have fixed up (our) minds till the World Cup (on continuing with Dhoni) and after that at later stages we will start grooming some of those (wicket-keepers).
I think MS Dhoni still remains the No 1 wicket-keeper in the world and day in and day out we have been saying this. In the current T20 series (against Sri Lanka), the stumpings he has effected and caught-behind he has taken are phenomenal, Prasad was effusive in his praise.
There is no comparison and I don't see any wicket-keeper, who can even come closer to him in world cricket, leave alone Indian Cricket, his statement more or less sealed the fate of all young keepers till the 2019 World Cup.
What Prasad said after that would be pretty disturbing for the likes of Pant and Sanju Samson, who are next in line.
Let me tell you frankly, those boys still are not up to the level as what we would have expected. We will still be giving them chances on India A tours and see that they are nurtured, Prasad, himself a former India stumper, said.  PTI

Dwayne Bravo scripts history - first bowler to claim 400 T20 wickets
One of the biggest stars in Twenty20 cricket - Dwayne Bravo is a quintessential cricketer every side wants to have in their ranks especially in the shorter format of the game.
Last Thursday, the dynamic Trinidadian achieved another milestone when he became the first bowler in T20 cricket to claim 400 wickets.
Playing for franchise Melbourne Renegades, Bravo claimed a five-wicket haul against Hobart Hurricanes to help his team register an easy seven-wicket win in Big Bash League match at Hobart.
The hosts got off to a flying start racing to 50 in 5 overs courtesy Doolan and Short before the 34-year old Bravo came into the attack and changed the complexion of the match in Renegades favour.
The Caribbean all-rounder started the match with 395 wickets against his name but his match-changing spell helped him to reach the landmark. Bravo picked up five for 28 to become the first bowler to breach the record 400-wicket mark. Next on the list is Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga with 331 wickets to his name.
Bravo, first removed Doolan for 26 and then came back to get the well-settled Andrew McDonald for 34 to initiate a collapse.
The West Indian all-rounder completed his five-wicket haul in the last over in which he accounted for Archer, Boyce, and Wade to restrict Hurricanes to 164 for 8 in their 20 overs.
In reply, Renegades lost destructive opener, Aaron Finch, early but Cameron White played a blistering knock of 79 to guide Melbourne to the 165-run target without much sweat.  India TVN

Government will establish excellent police service: Sagala
The governments objective is to establish an excellent and well-disciplined police service and enable people to lead their lives fairly and lawfully. The Police Service was able to regain its image of excellence with the advent of the Yahapalana government, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said.
He was addressing a meeting held at the Aluvihare grounds of the Kalutara Police Training School to mark the passing out parade of 476 police trainees including 275 Tamil male constables and seven woman constables on December 22.
Minister Ratnayake said he was honoured to attend the parade since it included policemen and women from the three main communities.
It was noteworthy to see village children of two rival camps who were at war joining hands to protect the country and people in a spirit of togetherness, the Minister said.
He said the Police in Sri Lanka had a 151-year-old history.
The period of war had been the most difficult and demanding. Officers and men had to face various difficulties in the period. They were away from their homes and loved ones for many years. Exigencies of service cut the training period for new recruits. Police officers could not get their due transfers, the Minister said.
Now all that were resolved and they were able to churn out a well trained police outfit with the advent of the Yahapalana government, the Minister said.
He said the Police Commission effected a fair and scrupulous transfer scheme. The government had streamlined police welfare activities and refurbished police barracks and resolved issues regarding quarters of the married police personnel. Cabinet approval were obtained to build 193 houses in Habaraduwa, the Minister said.
He said the Police Hospital would be developed and equipped and an insurance scheme would be provided for constable drivers. Salaries of the police personnel were increased by 41 percent for a start, the Minister said.

Highly favoured, yet non-exempted from trial
Christmas event is all about Gods self-emptying love; God becoming man and being born of the Virgin Mary. Marys yes to the angel was a sine qua-non to initiate Gods climax-revelation and the human salvation. Mary was singularly favoured (Lk. 1:28) and chosen by God to be the Mother of His only Son.
But, that highly favored one had to go through an abundance of trials and hardships. Carrying out Gods plan cost her so much. Although she is considered the short-cut to Jesus, she knew no short cuts to fulfill Gods plan of salvation. The path she trod was thorny and full of uncertainties.
Marys life teaches us that Gods chosen are to travel through narrow and thorny paths. All our trials and endless sufferings are never a sign of Gods abandonment.
Christs ultimate sacrifice on the cross has made each one of us a highly favoured child of God. As a chaplain to the National Hospitals-Colombo, what I see each day is the sickness, suffering and death. Yet, I am surprised to see their immense trust in the presence of the Eucharistic Lord while I administer Holy Communion.
Even after losing their hands and legs most of them do not seem to have lost their hope. What I know and believe is that their suffering is not a sign of Gods abandonment. Instead, it is a sign of Gods presence in their lives.
What I have come to believe is that where there is more suffering and trial, there are more opportunities for love. Our choseness does not mean that our life is free of trials and challenges, sorrow and tears, uncertainties and hardships. Marys faith was a leap into the dark. It was similar in the case of Abraham the father of Faith. He left his familiar Haran and ventured into the unknown -an uncertain territory - having trusted in the Lord even at old age of seventy (Gen. 12:1ff). So was it in the life of our Blessed Mother or rather even more.
If Abraham is the Father of faith, Mary should be the Mother of Faith in its fullest sense of the word, when we see her trustful leap into the dark!
King, yet born in a manger!
He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David (Lk. 1:32) were the words of the angel addressed to Mary. Mary would have never imagined her Divine Son to be born in a Manger. Everyone at Bethlehem refused to give them shelter and the manger would never have been as beautiful, cute and clean as the modern cribs of our day. A manger naturally lies in a place that stinks with the urine and dung of cattle. Our Blessed Mother would have been perplexed as to why the birthplace of her son had to be a cow-shed; would not there be any other better place for Gods Son Yet, she never complained but willingly accommodated herself to all these discomforts.
Creator of the universe, yet fleeing as a refugee!
The wise men knelt down and paid him homage. Opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh (Mt.2:11). Mary must have been very pleased to see her divine Child been honoured with royal gifts, like any of our mothers who love to see their children honoured. Alas!
Her happiness was just instant as they had to pack the things and flee to Egypt as refugees (Mt.2:13). The cruel hand of a tyrant was hunting her new-born infant too.
Humanly speaking, Mary would have been so upset to escape this way and the journey would have been very tedious as she had just been after child-birth. Although all these divine plans for her and her son were beyond her understanding, she willingly obeyed the Lord with complete trust.
Saviour of all, yet not saved from the trial!
I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today in the town of David a Saviour has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord (Lk. 2:10-11), were the words of the angel whose chorus rang out over the hills of Bethlehem that night and harkened with wonder by the shepherds in the field. They reported this to Mary and Joseph as they came to pay homage to this Saviour Child and Mary treasured these words (Lk. 2:17, 19).
When Jesus was arrested, condemned, mocked and crucified Mary would have been at a loss to see the apparent contradiction of the prophecy of the angels.
Why on earth the Saviour, Messiah, the Lord (Lk. 2:11) has to go through this entire agony and trial Her heart must have cried out in agony and disappointment.
Yet, she knew that God had not abandoned her. She was hopeful even when all the things seemed so dark and contradictory.
He spoke all good things, yet what was spoken of Him lately was no good!
Many good things were spoken of the Child. Simeon the righteous one took the child Jesus in his arms at the Temple, praised God saying  my eyes have seen the salvation (Lk. 2:30).
There, Anna the prophetess saw Child Jesus and began to praise God and to speak about Him (Lk. 2:38). Mary and Joseph were amazed at what was spoken of their Child at the Temple (Lk. 2:33).
She definitely felt honored and privileged to be recognized as the Mother of this great and promising Child.
But some years later people spoke all kinds of evil about Him. They called Him a lunatic: They said, He is out of his mind (Mk. 3:21), many of them said, He has a demon, and is insane, why listen to him (Jn. 10:20), and others here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners (Mt. 11:19). One cannot imagine how Mary faced these false allegations against her Son.
They were so frustrating that once she comes with his brethren to give cover to Jesus and take him home (Mk. 3:21). But, later she realised that all these trials and accusations were never a hindrance to God who was unfolding His plan of salvation and she obeyed God, even when the path before her seemed so dark and frustrating.
This aura of mystery that surrounded the mother of Jesus invites us who love and cherish the maternal intercession of our blessed Mother to learn from her life-story that all our trails, challenges and dark moments are never a sign of abandonment, yet they can be a powerful sign of Gods ever vigilant watch over us: to realise how He moulds us much the way as the clay is in the hands of the skilled potter.
Never should we be ever tempted to think that we are unimportant in the sight of the Lord even when our life is struck by tempests and storms. We are all favourite sons and daughters of our heavenly Father. More the love God has for us, more the challenges are to be expected on our path. More the challenges we face, more the love is experienced.
We never have to face all the trials by ourselves but Gods encouraging presence is always present in ways that are visible though mysterious. It is mysterious, because such a divine presence must be viewed only through lens of faith, visible because it touches me through my neighbours care for me. - Messenger

I would never give up clean political movement: President Sirisena
President Maithripala Sirsiena said he would never give up his dedication towards a clean political movement, whatever challenges he may have to face along his path. Someone has to perform the duty of bequeathing a good political culture to the future generation as a national need, and he is certain that the multitude of people would rally round him when he has shouldered that mission of the era.
President Sirsiena said this when he addressed SLFP organisers at a meting held at the Janadhipati Mandiraya on December 22 afternoon.
Highlighting the need to strengthen the SLFP as a clean political movement in the country, the President said a political movement which loved the country could not be built without strengthening the SLFP. Within the SLFP, he needed ministers, MPs, and candidates who an make the party colourful rather than depending on the party to make themselves colourful.
President Sirisena, who pointed out that the forthcoming local council election cold not be won through the use of State power or financial or official straight, added that under the new system of election, it could only be won through knowledge and intelligence. Under the new system, what would matter in winning the election is the behaviour, character, and the public appeal of a candidate. As such, a set of cultured peoples' representatives who truly love the country would emerge victorious at the forthcoming local government elections.
The party's organisational activities and preparations for the local government election were discussed at length during the meeting which was also attended by a group of SLFP senior minister and MPs.

We celebrate the dawn of Christmas, which fills hearts of Christians with peace and happiness, said Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunge in a Christmas message.
The message added: "The intention of the true Christian is to celebrate Christmas by highlighting the great humanity with the love and kindness of Jesus. Christmas encourages us to nurture our lives as a loving citizen, achieving the true spirit of Christianity by dispelling vicious thoughts.
"Jesus is the teacher who was born in a Manger. He was committed to helping the poor people with kind words, love and compassion. Moreover, following the way of Jesus lifestyle will enlighten the life of a Christian.
"The aim of our government is to provide the joys of Christmas to all citizens alike. It is clear that the meaning of national development and true reconciliation highlighted by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is similar to that. Hence, as Christians, we should commit ourselves to performing our social responsibilities as citizens to all humanity with the love under the affection of Jesus.
Wish you all strength and courage to celebrate Christmas as citizens that spreads and shares peace in the family and spreads love to your neighbours.
Wish you all a merry Christmas!

Juve beat Roma as Hamsik breaks Maradonas Napoli record
NAPLES, Saturday: Italian champions Juventus stayed firmly in the hunt for a seventh successive league title after a first-half goal by central defender Medhi Benatia gave them a 1-0 home win over AS Roma in a pulsating Serie A clash on Saturday.
The result kept Juve second on 44 points from 18 games, one behind leaders Napoli, who held on to pole position with a 3-2 home defeat of Sampdoria that saw their Slovakia midfielder Marek Hamsik break Diego Maradonas club scoring record.
Elsewhere, AC Milans dreadful form continued after a 2-0 home defeat by Atalanta left them 11th at the Christmas break, with the once mighty European giants winning only one of their last six league games.
Third-placed Inter Milan are five points off the pace after a shock 1-0 defeat at Sassuolo, their second successive reverse after a 3-1 home defeat by Udinese, while Roma stayed fourth seven points behind Napoli with a game in hand.
Juventus thoroughly dominated and stretched their perfect record against Roma at the Allianz Stadium to seven wins, while they have also scored in 24 of the last 25 games against the side from the Italian capital.
Benatia drilled in an 18th-minute winner during a frantic few seconds in the box as Alisson parried a Giorgio Chiellini header and deflected Benatias follow-up on to the crossbar before the Moroccan defender finally scored.
It was no more than Juve deserved as Sami Khedira and Mario Mandzukic missed early chances while Gonzalo Higuain blasted a sitter over the bar shortly after the break. Roma came to life in the latter stages as Edin Dzeko blazed his shot high and right back Alessandro Florenzi struck the woodwork in the 81st minute.
Bosnias footballer of the year Miralem Pjanic rattled the upright for Juventus with a long-range effort in stoppage time before Roma substitute Patrik Schick missed a gilt-edged chance at the death.
The Czech raced clear of his marker and with only Wojciech Szczesny to beat, shot straight at the Juventus goalkeeper much to the relief of the home faithful. AFP

LG bodies to manage waste disposal from January
Waste management in the Colombo city will devolve on local government institutions from January 1, with identified responsibilities.
The Minister gave this assurance addressing the gathering at the Colombo city beautification awards presentation ceremony 2017 held at the Waters Edge Hotel, Bataramulla recently.
The awards ceremony was held to honour and appreciate the services rendered by institutions and persons who had contributed towards the resolution of the garbage problem in the Colombo city.
Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka thanked every one from the officers at the highest level down to the labourers at the lowest rung who toiled hard round the clock salvage Colombo city from the garbage crisis at a time it earned the ire and criticism from the whole country.
Work on the Aruwakkalu sanitary land fill project will be completed soon to offer a permanent solution to the garbage problem in the Colombo city and its environs, Ranawaka said.
Most people were under the impression that the crisis could not be resolved without the support of the armed forces.
But the officials and the rest of the workforce were able to resolve the problem by themselves through devotion to duty,he said.
Minister Ranawaka said that armed forces had undoubtedly rendered and excellent service at times of natural disasters.
But this instance they were only involved in reviewing the work undertaken by officials and workers.
He said the Colombo city would come under a political authority from February next year and he hoped that it would continue the good work under its tenure. All this time his ministry had only helped to tide over the situation. The Sri Lanka Land Reclamations and Development Board team would inform each and every one in writing about their team responsibility before December 31.

He said the programme aimed to transform the Meethotamulla and Bloemendhal garbage mountains into urban parks would be launched next years.

State Minister Palitha Range Bandara was the only politician who attended the meeting.The Chairman of the Election Commission had sent a letter saying that no politician should attend the meeting.
Minister Ranawaka said all those who attended the meeting including religious dignitaries and the public lauded and supported the project saying they would be happy if this project could resolve the garbage problem once and for all.

Man City make it 17 straight wins and a 13-point lead
LONDON, Saturday : Manchester City extended their winning sequence to 17 and their lead at the top of the Premier League to 13 points with a 4-0 thrashing of Bournemouth on Saturday as Manchester United were held 2-2 at Leicester City and champions Chelsea suffered a goalless stalemate at Everton.
Pep Guardiolas City slickers began their unprecedented run of domestic league triumphs away to Bournemouth in August when a 97th-minute winner from Raheem Sterling sealed the points.
They found the south coast side an easier nut to crack this time with Sterling again on target as City continued to turn the title race into a procession.
Sergio Aguero also scored twice and Danilo completed the rout as record-breaking City reached Christmas with 55 points and 60 goals.
They have now scored 101 goals in 2017, becoming the first top-flight team to do so in a calendar year since Liverpool netted 106 throughout 1982.
City are 13 points ahead of Manchester United, who were criticised by manager Jose Mourinho for childish mistakes in defence and attack after conceding an equaliser in the fourth minute of added time at Leicester.
Two goals by Juan Mata had put them in front after Jamie Vardys 50th Premier League goal for the home side, and Leicesters Daniel Amartey was sent off.
But with Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard having missed clear chances and Chris Smalling limping, United allowed Harry Maguire to poke home Marc Albrightons cross.
It was an easy match to win, Mourinho said. Childish in their box and childish in our box, we were punished.
Chelsea, three points behind United, were left frustrated at a misty Goodison Park after 25 goal attempts came to nothing.
Tottenham Hotspurs Harry Kane also continues to rewrite records, with his seventh hat-trick of the year in all competitions firing his side to a 3-0 win at Burnley that put the Londoners back above their hosts, and Arsenal, into fifth.
Kane struck a first-half penalty and produced two clinical finishes after the break to equal Alan Shearers record of 36 Premier League goals in a calendar year set in 1995.
Arsenal and fourth-placed Liverpool drew 3-3 on Friday.
At the other end of the table Newcastle United ended a run of nine league games without a win to beat West Ham United 3-2 at the London Stadium and move out of the relegation zone.
Marko Arnautovic opened the scoring for West Ham but Henri Saivet, Mo Diame and Christian Atsu were on target for the Magpies who moved up to 15th with 18 points, a point ahead of West Ham who slipped down to 17th.
Stoke City arrested their worrying slide down the table to beat second-from-bottom West Bromwich Albion 3-1 while bottom club Swansea City, who sacked manager Paul Clement this week, drew 1-1 at home to Crystal Palace.
Bournemouth joined West Brom and Swansea in the drop zone.
Brighton and Hove Albion eased their relegation fears as Pascal Gross scored the only goal against Watford to give the Seagulls a first win in eight games. Watford have now lost four in a row and five of their last six.
Huddersfield Town remained comfortably in mid-table as they came from a goal down to draw 1-1 at Southampton.
City needed 27 minutes to take the lead against Bournemouth and it was fitting that Aguero was the man to score it with a diving header as he registered his 100th home goal for the club.
This side are always trying to find the striker, Aguero said. I only have to score the goal!
City are unbeaten at home in 2017 and when Sterling made it 2-0 shortly after halftime for his 12th league goal of the season it was just a matter what the winning margin would be.
Aguero headed his second and substitute Danilo joined the party within three minutes of coming on. - Agencies

The meaning of Christmas
This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. (1 John 4:9 NIV)
Its that time of the year again. Christmas comes but once a year. It is perhaps the most famous birthday in the world. Jesus Christ, Son and Messenger of God, was born in a manger in Bethlehem on this day more than 2,000 years ago.
Jesus Christ was a revelation in more ways than one in a world that was mired in superstition and primitive beliefs. Jesus of Nazareth, as he came to be known, was a beacon of hope to a population seeking spiritual solace. By the time Jesus Christ did the famous Sermon on the Mount, his doctrine was fairly well known and accepted all over the region. Two thousand years hence, His Words are still pristine and true. Jesus and Christianity changed the world to such an extent that some say modern history is His Story. It is a story of truth, love and hope.
The first recorded date of Christmas being celebrated on December 25th was in 336, during the time of the Roman Emperor Constantine who was the first Christian Roman Emperor. A few years later, Pope Julius I officially declared that the birth of Jesus would be celebrated on the 25th December every year, a tradition which has continued since. Christmas has evolved over two millennia into a worldwide religious and secular celebration, incorporating many pre-Christian traditions into the festivities. Although Sri Lanka and all other Asian nations except for the Philippines are not predominantly Christian, Christmas is widely celebrated in Asia, with the active participation of people belonging to all communities and religions, not just Christians.
Today, just like many other religious festivals, Christmas has been inundated by a torrent of commercialism. An international survey conducted last year revealed that many children think Christmas marks the birthday of Santa Claus, one of the most visible figures associated with Christmas. This shows that the true meaning and purpose of Christmas has been submerged. We see Christmas trees, lights, decorations and yes, Santa Claus everywhere, but do we pause to think about what Christmas means to followers of Christ
This does not mean that Christmas should be a solemn ceremony. Joy is central to the concept of Christmas  after all, it is a birthday celebration of a man who changed the world. But that joy should be shared with those who are less fortunate than we are. Our hearts should be open to the plight of the less fortunate. Rich people who see a brother or sister in need, yet close their hearts against them, cannot claim that they love God. (1 John 3:17)
Christmas is also a time for giving and for forgiving. As the popular saying goes, to err is human but to forgive is divine. Christmas is the ideal occasion for Christians to forgive and forget. It is easier to live without enemies and regrets. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. (Colossians 3:13 NIV)
Christmas is also a time of healing and finding renewed strength individually and collectively. As a nation, we are still going through a process of healing after a devastating war that pitted brother against brother, sister against sister. Christmas delivers the powerful message that we should all get together irrespective of our differences to rebuild our nation and live in harmony. Elements with vested interests are trying their best to inflame ethnic and religious passions to reignite the embers of conflict. This should not be allowed to happen. Peace is a goal we should all cherish after 30 years of conflict. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid. (John 14:27)
This Christmas, we should all resolve to live a life without sin. Christians believe that Jesus died on the Cross for all of our sins. In fact, all the great religious masters have advised us against engaging in sin. A sinful life takes us nowhere. On the other hand, a meritorious life is more rewarding and fulfilling. Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy. (Proverbs 28:13 NIV)
We have unfortunately lost sight of many moral and religious values and family bonds due to the desire for wealth. This is why there is so much trouble and grief in our lives. The words of Jesus offer solace for those who have fallen to the depths of despair. His words offer them an opportunity to rise anew from the embers of gloom and lead a sin-free life. As ever, Christmas can help us transform our lives and hope for the best. You will be secure, because there is hope. (Job 11:18 NIV)

SriLankan board offers to resign
SriLankan Airlines Chairman Ajith Dias and five directors have offered to resign to support the governments restructuring plan.
Contacted by the Daily News, Mr. Dias said that of the seven directors in the director board, six of them have tendered their resignation letters in support of the governments restructuring initiative of Airline. Mr. Dias told Daily News that he and five directors except for Harendra Balapatabendi resigned to pave way for a new director board, if needed.
Mr. Dias said that the ministerial committee appointed to look into the restructuring of Sri Lankan Airlines sat for discussions last Wednesday where the international consultant to look into the matter submitted its restructuring plan to the committee.
He stated that the Board of Directors offered their resignation letters immediately the day following discussions with the said committee. Mr. Dias said they have tendered their resignation letters to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who heads the ministerial committee on restructuring SriLankan Airlines.
Commenting on the restructuring plan, Mr. Dias said that it is a fitting move by the government and stressed the importance of continuing with a Board of Directors in a new management structure for the national carrier.
On the same subject, the Public Enterprise Ministry Secretary has stated that the ministry has not yet received an official resignation from the SriLankan Airlines Director Board, the media spokesman to the minister told Daily News.
A ministerial committee chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and an official committee headed by Treasury Secretary Dr. R. H. S. Samaratunga were appointed to look into the restructuring of SriLankan Airlines in November.
The two committees were also tasked with the selection of a suitable strategic partner and investor to operate the national carrier.
SriLankan Airlines which was a profit making establishment began to accumulate losses when the previous regime changed its management from Emirates Airlines.
The management agreement between Emirates and SriLankan Airlines ended in 2008 in a backdrop where the Rajapaksa regime cancelled the visa of then Emirates Chief Executive, Peter Hill over a disagreement. Emirates exited the airline after 2008 selling their 40 percent share to the government.
The accumulated profits during Emirate-managed SriLankan Airlines was around Rs 4.4 billion. The loss incurred in the seven years, from 2008 to the end of 2014, under the local management appointed by the previous regime was around Rs. 107 billion.
By 2015 national carriers accumulated losses stood at Rs. 128 billion rupees with debt of Rs. 76 billion and balance sheet discrepancies of Rs. 74 billion. The staff members of 5,113 in 2008, was also increased to 6,987 by 2015 which increased the operations cost of the airline.
The losses escalated as the previous regime decided to buy A330 and A350 aircraft in a reckless manner. The previous government signed an agreement worth of Rs. 143 billion, leasing fifteen aircraft for the SriLankan Airlines, without a cost benefit analysis. The agreement was on seven A330 narrow bodied aircraft and eight A350 wide bodied air craft.
Presidential Commission for SriLankan
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said a Presidential Commission will be appointed to investigate into the alleged abuse of state money and public property involving SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka, in the first week of January.

Starc out, Bird in for Boxing Day Ashes Test
MELBOURNE, Sunday - Australia pace spearhead Mitchell Starc was on Sunday ruled out of fourth Ashes Test with a heel injury and will be replaced by Jackson Bird.
Starc, who is Australia's leading wicket-taker in the series with 19, bruised his heel bowling in Australia's series-clinching third Test win in Perth last week.
There wasn't enough time for Starc to recover from the injury to his landing foot, with team management officially ruling him out two days before Tuesday's Melbourne Test.
Starc said he was hoping to return for the series-ending Sydney Test on January 4.
While Starc had been optimistic about his chances of playing, Australia's selectors took a cautious approach with their star paceman ahead of a key Test series against South Africa early in the new year.
I think common sense prevails, Australian selector Mark Waugh told Fox Sports.
I guess if it was 2-1 down or 2-1 up and this was a Test match we had to win you might push the envelope a bit further than when you're 3-0 up.
Starc's withdrawal continues his run of bad luck in the Melbourne Cricket Ground showpiece.
Starc has played in just one Boxing Day Test since making his debut in 2011.
Last year Starc scored 84 with the bat and took a match-sealing four-wicket haul in a final-day win against Pakistan.
Bird will now play his first Test in 12 months.
I've been ready to go for 12 months basically, Bird told reporters on Saturday.
I had a week in the Perth nets working on a few different things with bowling coach David Saker.
It'd be unbelievable to play an Ashes Test on Boxing Day.
Meanwhile, wicketkeeper Tim Paine is expected to play after joining his team-mates at training on Sunday after initially remaining at home in Hobart after his father-in-law suffered a stroke.

Stars who graduated from the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup
A glance at different international teams gives one a fair idea of the alumni of past ICC U19 Cricket World Cups. Just about every side is led by a player who figured in this tournament even though the focus often is on the trio of Virat Kohli, Steve Smith and Kane Williamson.
That is because these three played together in the 2008 edition and are now acknowledged as being among the best batsmen of their generation while also leading their national sides astutely. The story though is not much different for other teams, nor have the previous or following U19 CWCs been any less productive.
Smiths batting averages have been astounding in Test cricket with him being on the top spot in the MRF Tyres ICC Test Player Rankings for two years, while Kohli has consistently been top-ranked in both shorter versions of the game. Kane Williamson too is a regular in the top charts across formats.
But then Joe Root of England, who played in the 2010 tournament, enjoys a similar status in international cricket while Sarfraz Ahmed (Pakistan), Dinesh Chandimal (Sri Lanka), Jason Holder (Windies) and Graeme Cremer (Zimbabwe) are among the others to have been at the helm.
If Kohli led India to victory in 2008, Sarfraz had done so in the edition preceding it. The Pakistan captain also has the distinction of leading his side to victory in a senior ICC competition, an epic win over favourites India in the 2017 Champions Trophy making it one of the most cherished moments in Pakistans history.
Kohli credits the U19 CWC for his development and also remembers his contemporaries from the time, as does Williamson.
India captain Virat Kohli: The ICC U19 World Cup was a very important milestone in my career. It helped us get a good platform to build on and make our careers from thereon, so it holds a very importance place in my mind and heart. Its very important to understand and respect the opportunity it provides you and as I said, for me, it holds a very special place in my heart.
I remember playing against Kane. He was someone who always stood out in the team, his batting ability was very different from the other players who were around. Steve (Smith) I did not quite play against at the U19 level, so I didnt watch him bat, but he has come a long way in his career as well. It is good to know that so many people from that batch, not just three of us captaining our countries, but apart from that a lot of players have played for their respective countries.
New Zealand captain Kane Williamson: It is a great stepping stone. Playing international cricket within your age group allows players to see slightly higher standards, the best of the best from the under-19 perspective, so (it is) a great tournament to be involved in.
It is always fascinating as well that a number of guys you play against and play with, to see their progress. Often, when you meet players, you talk about the Under-19 World Cup. Each team had a few guys who are playing international cricket, which is good.
You dont get many opportunities to play World Cups, obviously at the top level  it is once every four years, if you are fortunate enough to be involved. So the opportunity to play at the age-group level is a very exciting opportunity and one that should be enjoyed.
In the past, there have been captains like Brian Lara, Inzamam-ul-Haq and Sanath Jayasuriya, all alumni of the first edition in 1998 and known for their accomplishments as players rather than of captains, all scoring in excess of 10,000 runs in at least in one form of the game.
Michael Clarke (Australia), Michael Atherton (England), Virender Sehwag (India), Brendan McCullum (New Zealand), Inzamam-ul-Haq (Pakistan), Angelo Mathews (Sri Lanka), Graeme Smith (South Africa), Chris Gayle (Windies) and Tatenda Taibu (Zimbabwe) are among the leading players to come through the U19 CWC system.
U19 World Cup players who went on to lead full-member sides:
Australia  Michael Clarke, Cameron White, George Bailey, Steve Smith, Aaron Finch, David Warner
Bangladesh  Rajin Saleh, Mohammad Ashraful, Mashrafe Mortaza, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Tamim Iqbal
England  Michael Atherton, Nasser Hussain, Alastair Cook, Graeme Swann, Eoin Morgan (played in U19 CWC for Ireland but captained England), Joe Root, Jos Butler, James Taylor
India  Virender Sehwag, Suresh Raina, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma
Ireland  William Porterfield, Kevin OBrien, Andrew White, Gary Wilson.
New Zealand  Lee Germon, Chris Cairns, Brendan McCullum, Ross Taylor, Kane Williamson, Kyle Mills, Tom Latham
Pakistan  Inzamam-ul-Haq, Shoaib Malik, Abdul Razzaq, Salman Butt, Azhar Ali, Sarfraz Ahmed
Sri Lanka  Sanath Jayasuriya, Thilina Kandamby, Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Upul Tharanga, Thisara Perea, Lahiru Thirimanne
South Africa  Graeme Smith, Johan Botha, Hashim Amla, Dean Elgar
Windies  Jimmy Adams, Brian Lara, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Chris Gayle, Denesh Ramdin, Dwayne Bravo, Darren Ganga, Ridley Jacobs, Sylvester Joseph, Darren Sammy, Jason Holder, Kieron Pollard, Jason Mohammed, Marlon Samuels
Zimbabwe  Tatenda Taibu, Prosper Utseya, Brendan Taylor, Elton Chigumbura, Hamilton Masakadza, Graeme Cremer

Sydneys Wenty Leagues cricket tour of Sri Lanka
Twelve promising young and talented cricketers from Sydney will embark on a cricket tour under the banner of Wenty Leagues Cricket Tour to Sri Lanka from 28 Dec to 9 Jan 2018. The squad comprises six cricketers from NSW Cricket Academy and State Challenge 2017 and five cricketers representing Parramatta District Cricket Association.
The tour shall provide the boys opportunities to compete against cricketers from leading Sri Lankan schools like St Josephs College and Wesley College in Colombo; Trinity College in Kandy; Richmond College in Galle; and S. Thomas College in Mt Lavinia. The tour will enable the young cricketers to experience playing conditions in the sub-continent and compete against the boys who are part of the Sri Lankan junior representative cricket pathway.
The matches will be played at NCC grounds and P Sara Oval (venue of Sri Lankas first Test match). They will also play at the Asgiriya Stadium where Sri Lankan legend Kumar Sangakkara played most of his cricket as a schoolboy. The boys will also have the opportunity to play at the picturesque Galle Stadium and finally at the tsunami affected Surrey County funded and maintained Maggona Surrey Monty Cricket ground.
Besides participating in the tournaments, there will be various activities and excursions to enrich the boys with Sri Lankan history and culture revolving around the Portuguese, Dutch and British who colonized Sri Lanka over four centuries between 1505 and 1948. For example, climbing UNESCO world heritage listed Sigiriya Rock Fortress, visiting tea and spice plantations in Hill Town of Matale and the Last Kingdom in Sri Lanka before the first colonization by Portuguese  Dalada Maligawa in Kandy.
The tour itinerary also includes a visit to SOS Childrens Village. SOS Children's Village focuses on family-based, long-term care of children who have lost their parents.
This non-profit organization provides impressive care, training and support to the orphans with a mission to help them shape their own futures.
To further advocate the organizations mission statement, we have proposed to fund the building of a cricket facility and the supply of cricket equipment, said Ganesh Mylvaganam who has been helping young cricketers in Sydney for the past 15 years and is also involved in coaching and administration of District Cricket (Juniors).
The squad consists of: Raveen Ganesh, Matthew Chatten, Finn Watkins, Jay Noorbergen, Aditya Dhond, Shanuk Karandeniya, Samuel Pickard, Ben Watson, Dillon Meurling, Patrick Xie, Ramana Paheetharan, Debasis Dey.

Tensions cast shadow over Holy Land Christmas
BETHLEHEM: Preparations were under way in Bethlehem on Sunday for Christmas, with tensions still simmering in the city and the region following Washingtons decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israels capital.
The controversial December 6 announcement by President Donald Trump unleashed demonstrations and clashes, including in the Israeli-occupied West Bank city Bethlehem, where Christians will mark the birth of Jesus in a midnight mass.
Bethlehem is normally flooded by tourists at this time of year, but has at times appeared almost empty of visitors as nearby clashes between Palestinian protesters and the Israeli army keep people away.
Archbishop Pierbattista Pizzaballa, apostolic administrator of the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, said dozens of groups had pulled out of planned visits after being scared off by the announcement and subsequent violence.
A Palestinian protester dressed in a Santa Clause outfit confronts an Israeli borderguard during a demonstration at the main entrance of the West Bank city of Bethlehem on December 23, 2017.
Of course this created a tension around Jerusalem and this diverted attention from Christmas, the Catholic churchs top official in Jerusalem said of Trumps announcement, but stressing that Christmas celebrations would go ahead as planned.
Perhaps as few as 50,000 Palestinian Christians make up just around two percent of the predominantly Muslim population of the West Bank and east Jerusalem.
Israels tourism ministry has said that Christmas preparations have not been affected and that it expects a 20 percent increase in the number of Christian pilgrims this year compared with 2016.
The ministry plans to operate a free shuttle service for the short distance between Jerusalem and Bethlehem for mass.
An Israeli police spokesman said that extra units will be deployed in Jerusalem and at the crossings to Bethlehem to ease the travel and access for the thousands of tourists and visitors.
The annual scouts parade in Bethlehem will march through Manger Square near the Church of the Nativity, built over the spot where tradition says Mary gave birth to Jesus and where celebrations will culminate with midnight mass.
Israel seized east Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it, in moves never recognised by the international community.
Palestinians view east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and interpreted Trumps statement as rejecting their right to a capital in east Jerusalem, although the Americans deny this.
In a statement ahead of Christmas, Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said Trumps announcement encouraged the illegal disconnection between the holy cities of Bethlehem and Jerusalem, both separated for the first time in over 2,000 years of Christianity.
Abbas called on world Christians to listen to the true voices of the indigenous Christians from the Holy Land... that strongly rejected the US recognition of Jerusalem as Israels capital.
They are the descendants of the first followers of Jesus Christ and an integral part of the Palestinian people, Abbas said, calling the local Christian community an inherent part of our societies.
In neighbouring Egypt, Coptic Christians who celebrate Christmas on January 6 saw a church in Giza attacked by a mob following Muslim prayers on Friday, the latest in some 20 such incidents in 2017.
Hundreds entered the church, chanting slogans calling for its demolition, destroying furniture and attacking worshippers before security forces restored order.
But in Iraq, this year marks a positive turning point for the Christian community in the northern city of Mosul.
Christmas mass will be celebrated there for the first time in years following the citys recapture from the Islamic State group in July. - AFP
