Looks at sustainable, cost effective construction solutions
Advantis Engineering Partners  With ATAD Steel
Advantis Engineering, a subsidiary of Hayleys Advantis Limited, recently entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with global pre-engineered building giant ATAD Steel Structure Corporation.
This latest partnership is in keeping with the companys ongoing efforts to bring sustainable, cost effective and rapid construction solutions to Sri Lanka.
Pre-engineered steel buildings are tailor-made solutions to meet the exact needs of customers. This system consists of factory-fabricated steel column and beam segments that are simply bolted together at site.
The external surface is constructed using varying walling systems based on the requirements of the customer. Upon completion of component fabrication, the entire building is shipped, in parts, to the site for rapid assembly. As the latest trend in building construction, this advanced solution has outstanding advantages to customers.
An efficiently designed pre-engineered building can cost less than a conventional steel building (or standard steel or civil construction) by up to 25% and can reduce the scheduled construction time by 30-50% with fast delivery and quick site assembly.
Raw materials can also be calculated more accurately enabling the reduction of material usage and wastage in the factory and on-site.
Low weight flexible frames of pre-engineered steel buildings also offer higher resistance to earthquakes, making it a safer option.
We are proud to be partnering with Advantis Engineering to bring our innovative and sustainable building solutions to Sri Lanka. At ATAD we are committed to bringing these new and efficient construction methods to the forefront of the construction industry and we believe Advantis Engineering shares our vision. Together we are confident in our ability to bring the next generation of construction solutions to this beautiful island, said Huynh Ngoc Dong, Chairman, ATAD Steel Structure Corporation.
Advantis Engineering, a pioneer in converting marine containers to sustainable, usable work spaces under its brand Convertainers, has long identified the need for rapid construction solutions to aid the countrys economic growth and development. As existing businesses expand and new ones enter the market the gap between available space and demand will only continue to grow and it will be years before developers, relying on traditional methods, are able to bridge this gap.
Commenting on this partnership, Kamal Wimalaratne, General Manager, Advantis Engineering, said, Providing a solution for the increasing scarcity of space in urban areas is crucial to the continued economic growth of our nation. With traditional construction being cumbersome and slow, especially for businesses that need large spaces constructed for their operations, it was clear that we needed an innovative solution to meet todays fast growing needs.
Hence we are proud to be partnering with ATAD Steel Structure Corporation, a leader in the construction industry, which creates easily deployable space solutions that help businesses get up and running much faster, resulting in quicker return on investment.

Armyworm caterpillar detected in Asia
INDIA: A caterpillar native to the Americas that has devastated crops across Africa has made its way to Asia, scientists in India said Thursday, warning of a threat to food security.
Scientists at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research said a survey had identified fall armyworm or Spodoptera frugiperda on more than 70 percent of maize crops examined in the Chikkaballapur area of southern Karnataka state, the first time the armyworm has been spotted in Asia.
In addition to maize, the pest can devour more than 180 plant species including rice, cotton and sugar cane, according to the Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International (CABI), a not-for-profit group.
A.S. Vastrad, a scientist with the University of Agriculture Sciences, said the yellowish-brown caterpillar had the potential to spread rapidly to Indias neighbouring states and countries.
The female lays eggs very rapidly and the pest has already entered two more Indian states, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, he told AFP.
The pest was first detected in Africa in 2016 and has since spread to more than 40 African countries causing massive destruction to maize, a staple food crop essential for food security in large areas of Africa and Asia.
It is likely that the armyworm arrived in India through human-aided transport after slipping through regulatory systems.
Natural migration is also a possibility as the moth can fly hundreds of kilometres in one night on prevailing winds.
Rapid action is necessary as the pest has the potential to spread to other Asian countries owing to suitable climatic conditions and the prominent cultivation of maize in the region, CABI said in a report on its website.
Before turning into a moth the armyworm destroys young plants, attacking their growing points and burrowing into cobs in older plants.
Vastrad said farmers in India were using some pesticides on an ad-hoc basis which had proved effective so far but there was a danger of the worm becoming resistant over time.
The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation says it has invested more than $9 million from its regular budget and mobilised $12 million for its fall armyworm programmes. - AFP

Calamansi Cove Villas reopens with a splash
Juliet Coombe always loves a deal and so booked a deluxe price weekend at Calamansi Cove Villas and was enchanted by the curated interiors and range of exciting new experiences.
Travellers who have taken up this wonderful August deal are already talking about the stunning new dining room features with its spectacular Calamansi leaf art installation piece, created by a master craftsman from the area, celebrating the sweet orange fruit that the villas are named after. This incredible Calamansi leaf art installation piece has been created by Sanjaya Gikiyanage, and designed by Janaka de Silva, and is just one of many beautiful new things to see at this exclusive resort with its gorgeous interiors and private garden villas. This iconic metal artwork was produced over several months by hand, leaf by leaf from battered copper and brass with over 4,000 leaves latched together splashing reflections all over the tropical open fine-dining room looking over the Indian Ocean.
To celebrate the make over, the chef has created an array of exciting novel and delicious new dishes for the Tangerine Restaurant menu in which the Calamansi sculptured light holds court. These include seared-peppered tuna, caught fresh from the cove by the fishermen, every day, and a mouthwatering new chili coconut ice cream produced from the coconut trees lining the azure pool, where you can enjoy their signature cocktails as the sun sets. The people of the area are also experts in the art of cooking fish dishes like amble thyala, which uses lots of black pepper and cinnamon grown all around the cove. You can learn how to cook the authentic local fish dish on cinnamon leaves with the black paste and salt, and curry leaves sprinkled on top in a low flame. Healthy cooking is like the lifestyle slow, spicy and is always fun to make. On top of that the hotel chef explains that it is excellent high-energy food made from tuna fish. For the truly adventurous or more-healthy minded, they have also created their own version of avocado ice cream and are now doing coastal cooking classes for foodies who love tropical delights.
For August only  to celebrate the areas famous master artists, Calamansi Cove Villas by Jetwing will have an artist in situ, doing creative workshops for their guests from mask making to learning how to make your own paints from the forest in their lush tropical gardens. If time away from it all is what you are looking for, you can simply chill out with a book in their new air-conditioned library next to the dragon antique doors  one of the many treasures bought from one of the five fun antique shops in the area. If you fall in love with any of the pieces Shalini will organize a tour of these fascinating Aladdin like spaces that have rooms that lead from one period of colonial treasures into another area with delightful workshops behind creating master pieces for villas along the coastline.
Whether you want to chill out on villa terraces or in your private villa garden, watching the sunset, or playing beach volley ball with the staff, or even jumping the Calamansi Cove rocks, there are so many new exciting activities planned including yoga on the beach or in the garden  with a special tour in October for those who want to have a mindfulness week, and art tour of Ambalangoda. A half-day trip that includes the buzzy Ambalangoda market, and learning how to create coconut oil the traditional way with a bullock pulling the turning wheel, and then after a quick drink stop at the coconut stall, disappearing along a side street to see textiles being spun on old wooden hand looms. This is by far my favourite part of the tour watching the woven material appear on the handloom in beautiful tropical colours, and then see how talented the mask makers are like Sumit, who creates masterpieces out of a simple log of wood. Of course the kids love learning how to pull strings with life size puppets being tailored for by Nalin Gamvari, watch batik art pieces appearing like magic from the wax, acrylic paintings, fabric designs in old and new styles, quirky sculptures, even metal expressionists and so much more if you have the time to really explore this artisan haven of over a hundred creative families.
All this and so many other things can be enjoyed this August like beach volley ball and fishing at a stunning inspirational property that celebrates great food for the mind, body and soul, and curated tours of the area that really connect you with the island people, in a relaxed already much loved coastal location. A place that is geographically stunning with a wonderful natural harbour and the fascinating temple of Brahakmana Watta village, which I am told is well over a hundred years old. There are more than 620 families living in this idyllic spot and many of them have mythical stories around Ravanna and so no day is dull in this coastal villa paradise.

Canines to the rescue!
After a long, hard, stressful day, theres nothing better for a dog owner than returning home and seeking comfort from your canine pal.
While you may often wonder whether your furry friend genuinely loves you as much as you do them, recent research suggests that dogs clearly demonstrate their affection when their owners are showing visible signs of upset.
Not only can your dog tell when youre feeling down in the dumps, but theyll also do everything in their power to make you feel better if so, a new study has found.
The study, which was published in the journal Learning and Behaviour, put a cohort of dogs to the test by placing their owners on the other side of a clear door and having them either hum Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star or cry.
The group of dogs, which included a variety of breeds such as golden retrievers, pugs and labradors, were able to see and hear their owners at all times.
The researchers discovered that the dogs who opened the doors to reach their owners when theyd been crying did so three times faster than the dogs whose owners had been humming.
On top of that, the dogs who came through the door to comfort their weeping owners exhibited lower stress levels, indicating that they didnt feel too stressed to help their owners when in need.
We found dogs not only sense what their owners are feeling, but if a dog knows a way to help them, theyll go through barriers to help them, says Emily Sanford, a graduate student in psychological and brain sciences at Johns Hopkins University and lead author of the study.
Every dog owner has a story about coming home from a long day, sitting down for a cry and the dogs right there, licking their face. In a way, this is the science behind that.
While some of the dogs were quick to spring into action when their owners were seemingly upset, the dogs who showed the most signs of stress were the ones who didnt try to go through the door at all.
This wasnt due to lack of caring, but simply not knowing what to do to help, the study stated.
Dogs have been by the side of humans for tens of thousands of years and theyve learned to read our social cues, Sanford says.
Dog owners can tell that their dogs sense their feelings. Our findings reinforce that idea, and show that, like Lassie, dogs who know their people are in trouble might spring into action.
The study, which assessed the behaviour of 34 dogs, was inspired by an experience that co-author Julia Meyers-Manor had with her pet.
While playing with her children, Meyers-Manor had begun calling out for help having been buried by her children in a pile of pillows.
My husband didnt come rescue me, but, within a few seconds, my collie had dug me out of the pillows, Meyers-Manor, assistant professor of psychology at Ripon College, says.
I knew that we had to do a study to test that more formally."

Caring for your cats lungs
The disease is spread by infected mosquitoes, is increasingly being recognized as an underlying cause of health problems in domestic cats. Cats are an atypical host for heartworms. Despite its name, heartworm primarily causes lung disease in cats. It is an important concern for any cat owner living in areas densely populated by mosquitoes, and prevention should be discussed with a veterinarian.
The heartworm disease not only affects dogs, but also less common infection in cats. The cat is not a natural host for the heartworm parasite, Dirofilaria immitis, and so the heartworm is not likely to complete its entire life cycle. That means that fewer and smaller worms survive, and many do not reach a cats heart. The worms that do survive and the resulting immune reaction that the cats body sets up to kill the developing worms can cause severe health problems.
mWhat happens inside the cat's body
When a mosquito carrying the heartworm parasite, Dirofilaria immitis, bites a cat, larvae are transmitted into the bloodstream. The larvae migrate toward the heart over a period of around four to six months, maturing as they go, then settle in the heart, pulmonary arteries and blood vessels of the lungs. Because a domestic cat is not a natural host for the heartworm parasite, many of the worms die. These along with the living worms cause severe inflammatory and immune responses in an infected cat.
mWho get the disease
Cats of all ages, living in any region, can contract heartworm, but the disease is more prevalent in felines who live in areas densely populated by mosquitoes. Outdoor cats are at greater risk because of increased exposure to mosquitoes. However, indoor cats are also susceptible to mosquito bites, so its smart to discuss prevention with your vet. The heartworm infection can be especially life-threatening to kittens and older cats.
Clinical Signs:-
The following signs may indicate that your cat has been infected: persistent cough, breathing difficulties (panting, wheezing, rapid or open-mouthed breathing), depression, loss of appetite, weight loss, sporadic vomiting, lethargy, sudden death, breathing difficulties that occur in the first stage of heartworm disease, caused by worms newly arriving in the heart and lungs, were likely previously diagnosed as feline asthma or bronchitis.
mHow can you prevent the disease
There are several medications available that reliably prevent feline heartworm infection. Most of the animal clinics in Sri Lanka do have facilities to check your cat for Heartworm diseases. Therefore always free to discuss with your vet and get screened your cat for heartworm infection with blood tests before being given any type of preventative medication.
Its also a good idea to limit your cats exposure to mosquito-infested areas and bring her in for preventative screenings once a year by a qualified veterinarian. Regular checkups are also helps to detecting early infections.
mHow you diagnose Heartworm Disease 
Heartworm disease is not as easily diagnosed in cats as it is in dogs. When cats show signs of respiratory difficulty and heartworm is suspected, diagnosis is usually based on a cats history, physical examination, radiographs, echocardiogram and blood tests.
Treating Heartworm Disease
There is currently no specific medication for feline heartworm infection. The good news is that many heartworm-infected cats are able to fight the infection themselves, and can be monitored with radiographs every few months, while waiting out the worms lifespan. If an infected cat shows symptoms of lung disease, medication should be given to help control coughing and vomiting.
mIf undiagnosed/untreated what will happen
Although some cats are able to fight the infection on their own, the following can occur if heartworms are not monitored and treated: damage to walls of heart, damage to pulmonary blood vessels, possible obstruction of blood flow through pulmonary arteries, impaired breathing, heart and lung failure, kidney and liver damage, sudden death.

Cinnamon  Elephant Project  wins PATA  Gold Award
Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts together with their globally acclaimed ecotourism arm Nature Trails, was recognized for their ground-breaking elephant conservation project by the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) for the PATA Grand and Gold Awards 2018.
Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts will be honoured with the Gold Award for the Best Ecotourism Project under the Environment category at the awards ceremony that will take place in Langkawi, Malaysia in September during the PATA Travel Mart 2018. We take great pride in the work that we do to promote responsible tourism in Sri Lanka, and the Cinnamon Elephant Project is one that is extremely significant to us due to the critical nature of this sensitive issue and that this would give us a greater opportunity to create more awareness of our efforts and encourage best practices in eco-tourism especially concerning elephants and their habits, stated Chitral Jayatillake, Head of Nature Trails at Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts. We are truly honoured by this PATA Gold Award for our work, and trust that this would create more awareness of our efforts and encourage best practices in ecotourism across the island and among tourists. We thank PATA for this wonderful honour. The PATA Awards 2018 attracted 200 entries from 87 organizations and individuals worldwide. An independent judging committee consisting of fourteen senior executives from the global travel, tourism and hospitality sectors selected the winners. Dr. Mario Hardy, PATA CEO, stated in an official announcement released by PATA, This years winners exemplify the true values of the Association in working towards a more responsible travel and tourism industry in the Asia Pacific region. Considered to be among the top 10 greatest natural animal spectacles in the world, the Elephant Gathering is the largest wild gathering of the Asian elephant, occurring annually within the safety of the protected Minneriya and Kaudulla National Parks in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka. The Cinnamon Elephant Project, a collaborative effort initiated in 2014, between Nature Trails and Centre for Conservation and Research with the full funding support from John Keells Foundation. This integrates both long-term conservation efforts of the endangered Asian elephant, and inclusive ecotourism practices in Sri Lanka through elephant viewing based on this annual elephant gathering.
The team successfully completed the first phase of the project in 2017 where over 70 elephants were identified, named and photo-catalogued. Phase two of the project was activated in early 2018 with the collaring of the matriarchs of two elephant herds with support from Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC), which enabled state-of-the-art satellite and GPS tracking of the two herds after the dispersion of the gathering. Data gathered from tracking both collared matriarchs will help understand the exact seasonal movement of the elephant herds, and help tackle human-elephant conflicts through better land and water management recommendations. This also facilitates effective, long-term conservation initiatives for Asian elephants.

MPs, mind your mandate
Members of Parliament are there to look after the people. Because all the people of the country cannot get involved in preparing legislations and other related matters, we have appointed MPs for that. They represent people in the parliament. They must speak on behalf of people. Money in the Treasury and other government funds are all money belonging to people of the country. It is the duty of the MPs to look after this money. People cannot do that. Their representatives must do that.
If the people are having any grievance, it is the duty of the MPs to talk in the parliament or submit a proposal to the parliament and find a solution to that grievance.
There are basic needs of people such as food items, education, healthcare, transport, security, police service etc. It is the duty of the MPs to take action to provide these basic needs to people.
But is it happening now. We do not see that it is happening.
We can see MPs fighting for their salary increases, their benefits and allowances. For their duty free car permits. For their petrol allowance. For their telephone allowance.
Most of the time MPs are struggling to develop their political party. Organise party meetings. Collect people for party meetings. Attending weddings, birthday parties, funerals, prize givings, etc.
They are worried about finding employment to their friends, relations and party supporters.
They keep several government maintained cars. They have several government paid employees.
They go abroad frequently using government money. For medical treatment they very often go to Singapore or USA using government money.
Some are collecting wealth by misusing their position as a MP. Many are living luxury lives misusing government funds.
Many of them serve themselves lavishly as the spoon is with them.
This is all wrong. We very kindly remind that they are our representatives. They must not try to look after themselves. They must fight for the requirement of people. They must see that justice is done to people. Whenever there is INJUSTICE they must fight and prevent that. They must see that people are getting a reasonable monthly income. They are not harassed by thugs and underworld. They have proper health and education facilities.
This very kind request and reminder is to all politicians and to those who are trying to be politicians.

Court cases hampering Samurdhi officers pension issue  Minister
If protest campaigns will help resolve the outstanding problems of Samrudhi officers, I will also join such protests, Social Empowerment Minister P. Harrison said.
Addressing a meeting attended by Samurdhi officers at the Weligama Town Hall, Harrison said his ministry had held discussions with all parties concerned towards resolving the problems of Samurdhi officers.
The solution has been held up due to several legal issues before court, he said.
There are two cases pending in the courts regarding the employees problems. The Attorney General had told them to wait for the court rulings before taking a final decision on resolving the issues.
The minister said the problem confronting Samrudhi officers who have completed 20 to 23 years service was about their future.
They were not entitled to pension benefits and did not receive a proper salary. Previous governments had made Samurdhi officers their political tools to achieve their ends without resolving their problems and their future aspirations.
Harrison said only three months had passed since he took over the Social Empowerment Ministry.
He had held discussions with all relevant institutions including the Public Administration and Home Affairs Ministry, Pensions Department and the Wages Commission and submitted five Cabinet papers regarding the issue because in his view, Samurdhi officers should receive priority over the issues of Samurdhi beneficiaries.
He would resolve these problems and ensure pension rights to Samurdhi officers before he relinquished office as the minister in charge of Samurdhi, he said.

Cubist-inspired celebrity portraits
You might struggle to put a Rubiks Cube together (dont worry, we cant do it either), but some people seem to make it look so easy. Artist Giovanni Contardi doesnt bother just solving the cube, he uses it to create art.
The 24-year-old has been using 700 to 730 of them to make celebrity portraits that are five feet tall. Some of the notable stars include Game of Thrones Maisie Williams, Foo Fighters Dave Grohl, and the late Amy Winehouse. Jared Leto, in his Joker character, Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven, and Marilyn Monroe also make the cut.
The Italian artist, based in Melbourne, has racked up 20,000 followers on Instagram and has even caught the eye of the celebrities in the pictures.
Having solved his first Rubiks cube at the eage of seven years, Giovanni began competing worldwide in his early teens, eventually winning the European Rubiks Cube Championship in 2010.
The Rubiks Cube enthusiast is able to construct his masterpieces within a matter of hours  his quickest being just one hour and 40 minutes. I start by printing off a photo of the celebrity I admire at the time  usually its someone from a TV series or film Ive watched that week, he explained.
I use a grid to divide the portrait into every single cube, so that is faster to reproduce. Then I get all the cubes ready in preparation before putting them into crates. The most enjoyable part is figuring out how to use oranges and reds to make definition in the face. Thats the most challenging thing and takes between an hour or two. After he completes each cube, laying them all out to create the faces takes just under three hours, he said.
Having been solving them for almost 10 years, Giovanni said he finds the process of completing and putting the cubes together relaxing.
Ive only done about 20 portraits so its early days. But Im hoping Ill be able to do some permanent installations soon in different areas around the world. My favourite is my latest one of Millie Bobby Brown as Ive recently started watching Stranger Things. Im planning to do Will Smith next. Hes a celebrity Ive been wanting to do for a long time. So Im very excited, he said.

Esala Perahera  with Cinnamon Citadel Kandy
Held annually in the full-moon month of Esala, the Kandy Esala Perahera is the ultimate celebration and showcase of Sri Lankas rich heritage and vibrant culture. The significance of the month of Esala (which falls on July or August) is that it is believed to commemorate the very first teaching imparted by the Buddha, following his enlightenment. Conducted in reverence to the sacred Tooth Relic of Lord Buddha which is contained in the ancient palace of Kandy known as Sri Dalada Maligawa, the flamboyant annual procession unites Sri Lankans from all corners of the island and draws culture enthusiasts from across the globe.
Majestic origins and timeless rituals:
With an origin rooted in centuries passed, The Esala Perahera in Kandy is one of the oldest and most significant of all Buddhist festivals in Sri Lanka. The Sinhalese term Perahera refers to a procession of ceremonial musicians, drummers, dancers, singers, acrobats, whip crackers, flag bearers, sword carriers, fireball dancers and various other performers accompanied by a large number of elaborately adorned elephants parading the streets in celebration of a religious event. Primarily hosted to honour the sacred Tooth Relic of Lord Buddha, the Esela Perahera is also conducted with the intention of beseeching blessings from the divinities for bountiful rains and a prosperous harvest, as well as an intercession to shower blessings on the people. The illustrious ten-day festival commences with the KapSituveema - a ritual where young jackfruit trees are planted in the premises of each of the four Devales (Shrines of God) dedicated to the four Guardian Gods Natha, Vishnu, Katharagama and Pattini, and ends with the traditional Diya Kepeema - a water cutting ceremony which is held at the Mahaweli River at Getambe in Kandy.
A flamboyant fusion of history,culture and religion:
Exploring every facet of Sri Lankan culture and Buddhist heritage, the Esala Perahera features an endless variety of traditional local dances, including graceful Kandyan dances, striking whip and fire dances and many other folklore inspired performances. The entire route of the procession is decorated with countlesslights which are beautifully synchronized with the proceedings and performances of each Perahera.
An idyllic base in the heart ofthe bustling festivities:
Located 116km away from Colombo, in Sri Lankas scenic Hill Country, Cinnamon Citadel Kandy is nestled in the heart of the city of Kandy, making it the ideal base for those traveling from far and wide to view the Perahera. Set against the picturesque backdrop of the Knuckles Mountain Range shrouded in varying degrees of mist, and built to resemble the majestic realm of the last Sinhalese kings, Cinnamon Citadel Kandy takes you on an enchanting cultural journey and tells you an ancient tale of its own.
The resort bears many vivid features in the form of vibrant tones of red and traditional Kandyan art, which evoke a rich cultural presence and a true sense of regal luxury. Cinnamon Citadels ample verdant gardens which are located near a tranquil bend in the Mahaweli River offer a quaint and tranquil atmosphere for guests to relax and unwind after a long and exuberant day of crowding alongside the streets to witness the magnificent Esala Perahera.
This year, the Kandy Esala Perahera is scheduled to take place from 16th to 26th August in its usual series of colourful Kumbal Peraheras, Randoli Peraheras and vivacious ritualistic ceremonies - all of which will culminate in yet another iconic celebration of Sri Lankas authentic historical and cultural heritage.

New evidence in SLA investigation:
Former chairman allegedly rerouted flight for personal benefit
Former SriLankan Airlines (SLA) Chairman Nishantha Wickramasinghe, who could not withstand a flight delay of one-and-a-half-hours in Singapore on January 24, 2014, had allegedly arranged for another SriLankan plane flying on a different route, to be diverted through Singapore for him to travel to Sri Lanka.
He had used a ruse, claiming that a State delegation was waiting in Singapore to return Sri Lanka in order to get the plane directed. This was disclosed before the Presidential Commission investigating the alleged frauds, including the misappropriation of state funds and properties connected to SriLankan Airlines, during evidence given by SLA Airlines Operations Manager Gopitha Indrajith Ranasinghe, recently.
Cross-examined by Additional Solicitor-General Neil Unambowe, witness Indrajith Ranasinghe said that to his knowledge, it was the first time in the history of the SLA that a chairman had changed the official route of a SriLankan Airlines plane for personal reasons.
Wickramasinghe had made Kuala Lumpur  Colombo flight no. 319 diverted through Singapore, to travel to Colombo. The flight had a compliment of 130 passengers on board, and four of them were flying business class.
He said the normal route of a SriLankan plane was only changed for the country's President, adding that the said incident was contrary to normal practice. He said the list of the names given in the so-called State delegation included only Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama and Nishantha Wickremsinghe's wife. He said Minister Dr. Amunugama had never complained about flight delays. There were no records showing that any plane had been directed at short notice for his benefit.

Govt allocates Rs 1 bn  for tea replanting
The Government will offer a Rs. 1 billion tea replanting subsidy this year to increase the area under tea cultivation.
The area under tea cultivation is stagnant and shrinking. Replanting is essential for increasing and remaining competitive, Minister of Plantation Industries Navin Dissanayake said that in an interview with Daily News Business.
It is with this objective that the government is offering Rs. 1 billion as a tea subsidy, he said. Currently the tea is grown in 22 5,000 hectares and up to June 2018, the total export earnings were at Rs. 113, 940 million.
He said that 2018 is turning out to be a good year for the tea industry and they are expecting a harvest of a total of 330 million MT kilograms by the end of the year. This was 307 million MT in 2017.
The Minister said that Sri Lanka Tea is also now gaining a bigger maker share in Japan as they see a new trend among the younger generation to consume value added tea. He said that while the demand from Russia and China for local tea is growing they were also planning to promote tea in small breakaway states of Russia like Latvia, Lithuania and Belarus.The total black tea exporters to China in 2016 was 7, 463 MT in 2016 bringing in a forex of US$ 30.98 million and this increased to 9,472MT in in 2017 with a value of US$ 46.98 million showing a sharp increase. Tea Kiosks are being growing rapidly in China and Sri Lankan black tea is being marketed in them.
The Minister said that in Sri Lanka too this concept is growing and several tea centers are in existence mainly targeting the tourists in Central province and the up market clientele in Colombo. The Ministry likes to set up more tea centers and like to pattern the private sector to set up similar ventures as Public Private Partnerships.

Meghan Markle will take on important role for Prince William, royalinsider explains MEGHAN MARKLE, 37, is the sister-in-law of Prince William, 36, who issecond in line to the British throne. Meghan, who is married to Williamsbrother Prince Harry, 33, will take on an important role when herbrother-in-law is King, said an insider.
Meghan Markle is the newest member of the royal family, but she may alreadybe preparing for a major role. The Duchess of Sussex formally became a royal when she married Prince Harry on 19 May this year.
This will come with substantial responsibility, according to a royal expert. As sister-in-law to Prince William, who will one day be King, Meghan will be expected to support him, former royal butler Grant Harrold told Express.co.uk. The Duchess of Sussex will have an important role to develop as one day she will be sister in law to the King, he explained.
Meghan Markle will perform royal duties on behalf of Prince William when he is King
She will take on duties on behalf of the monarch as we see the Royals do today for the Queen.
Meanwhile, Meghans new sister-in-law, Kate Middleton, 36, will have a loton her plate.
Both royal duchesses have important roles to fulfil, Grant explained.I imagine we will see more of the Duchess of Cambridge as she prepares forher future role as Queen.
Meghan has already stepped into a number of royal honours since marrying Prince Harry.
She is a Patron of The Royal Foundation Forum, alongside Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.
She also attended engagements as part of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London. Finally, she regularly attends engagements on behalf of the monarchy. Sheeven accompanied Queen Elizabeth on a solo engagement in Cheshire last June.
Meghan left her acting career behind last year in favour of devoting herself to royal duty alongside Prince Harry.
She recently declined an opportunity to say goodbye to her former career. Meghan apparently politely turned down an invitation to the 70th Emmy Awards ceremony in LA next month, sources told The Sun. One source added that Meghans decision appeared to be a line in the sand between her acting and royal careers.Another source said: We had hoped Meghan would attend as a way of saying goodbye to her Suits fans and colleagues.
Show executives and NBC had offered Harry and her an invitation tocelebrate with the biggest stars around, meet her showbiz friends and even present an honour. But Meghan is not attending.
Meghan addressed her career change late last year during her and Harrys engagement announcement interview. She said: I don't see it as givinganything up, I just see it as a change.

Prakash Chandra Upadhyay, a micro-sculptor, said he drilled a minuscule hole in a piece of wood and inserted the graphite to create the pencil, which requires a pair of tweezers to use.
Upadhyay said it took him about four days worth of effort to make the tiny pencil, which measures .2 inches long and only .02 inches wide.
"This pencil is made of a single piece of wood. The wood has been drilled and the lid has been fixed in it," Upadhyay told ANI News. Upadhyay's pencil was recognized as the smallest by Assist World Records Research Foundation.

Keeping  budding artists   busy
Vivid brush strokes and thoughtful art work come as a beacon of hope from children. It has always acted as a medium to connect different genres and age groups without any ethnic or class barriers. The inaugural Mihira Bruhaspathi Childrens Art Competition was organized with this aspect in mind. It is sponsored by Ranpath Paper Pvt Ltd.
The brainchild of Bruhaspathi Academy Head Harish Walpola, the Mihira Bruhaspathi Childrens Art Competition garnered a huge response from tiny tots and well as school goers. The academy supports individuals from different age groups to develop their aesthetic skills, such as, art, music and dance, free of charge. More than 1, 000 entries were received before the closing date of entries for the competition. Joining hands with Sri Lankas oldest childrens weekly newspaper, Mihira, Walpola hopes to make it an annual event which will inculcate aesthetic values in the younger generations, to help them become balanced individuals and holistic citizens
The competition also addresses the parents to make them realize the importance of aesthetics in holistic living, he added.
The awards ceremony of the Mihira Bruhaspathi Childrens Art Competition 2018 will be held at the National Library auditorium on August 11 at 9 am. Held under three age categories: seven to 10 years, 11 to 14 years and 15 to 18 years, many stunning paintings drawn by budding young artists were entrees to the competition. Each winner of the three categories will receive a Vincent Van Gogh Award along with a cash prize of Rs 25, 000 and one years subscription of Mihira Newspaper.
The event is a prelude to a project which will be held across the island. Art workshops will be held at district level. The team will follow up on the winners and participants, encouraging them to hone their skills via the project. Two members in the jury have already given their green light to support the cause. Individual attention will be given to participants at the event and many renowned artists in Sri Lanka will be a part of the event.
Speaking about the link between art and youth Walpola said that there seems to be a dearth of artists among the younger generation.
It is time consuming to become a good artist as you need to possess other qualities like commitment, courage, effort and skill. Our aim is to help these individuals develop their artistic streak and nurture a generation of good artists, he noted. Mihira Editor Jagath Hewapanna said that Mihira has always strived to give a quality and meaningful output to its readers.
This initiative fulfills a void in Sri Lanka at a time the younger generation is moving away from art. Our goal is to produce many a new generation of gifted artists islandwide, he commented. Ranpath Paper Pvt Ltd Managing Director Niroon Buddhasiri said that space has been created for 10 winners with the aim of treating their talents equally. Elaborating on the Vincent Van Gogh Award he stated that though the society during his time considered Van Gogh as a failure he was later globally recognized as the best impressionist.
In life there are no failures. You need to motive yourself to look for your identity and develop skills related to it. I would also like to express my gratitude to parents who encouraged their children to take part in the event. It is heartening to see note that there are those who motivate children to engage in aesthetic activities rather than merely push them towards academic achievements, Buddhasiri opined.
The identity of a country rests on its culture and history. If art and culture demises, our identity too will be wiped out. Buddhasiri says that he believes that it is a corporate citizens duty to protect the identity of a country by preserving its culture. This is mainly why Ranpath Paper Pvt Ltd sponsored the event.

A long, hard battle with CKDu:
Kidney conscious
For more than three decades, thousands living in the hot spots in Sri Lanka have suffered from a disease that destroys their kidneys. Mostly men living in poor agricultural community are affected with this disease where their kidneys become irreversibly damaged -- until they die.
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a painful disease resulting from uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension, the most common causes of the condition worldwide. Some other conditions that affect the kidneys are Glomerulonephritis, inherited diseases, such as polycystic kidney disease, malformations that occur as a baby develops in its mothers womb, obstructions caused by problems like kidney stones, tumors or an enlarged prostate gland in men. Early detection and treatment can often keep chronic kidney disease from getting worse. When kidney disease progresses it may eventually lead to kidney failure, which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to maintain life.
However in the last three decades, quite a lot of bread winners of families in North Central province died due to kidney failure baffling the health officials because of the absence of identified causes for CKD. Not only the cause of the disease remains a mystery to date but also the true number of Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) cases remains unknown. Since then CKDu has emerged as a significant contributor to the burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in rural Sri Lanka.
Early 90s in Anuradhapura we found patients with similar symptoms but without other non communicable diseases that cause CKD. The patients were from certain villages of Madawachchiya, Padaviya and Kebithigollawa areas. Patients were mostly seen in dry zone and mostly affected were paddy farmers aged between 40 to 70 years. Affected were also predominantly males, Renal Disease Prevention and Research Units National Coordinator, Dr Asanga Ranasinghe explained.
In the global scenario, the numbers are highest in four equatorial regions around the world -- Central America, India, Egypt including Sri Lanka. Recently the regional epidemiologists have recognized their similarities in this unique form of CKDu. Rates of the disease in Central America are fairly widely acknowledged, with 46% of male deaths in the region of Chichigalpa, Nicaragua, over the past decade thought to be caused by CKDu, according to La Isla Foundation. In Central America, most affected have been men farming sugar cane.
Sri Lankan authorities having had enough of the mystery which took away thousands of lives convened experts from around the world to find answers, in collaboration with the World Health Organization. As Sri Lanka did not have sophisticated laboratory facilities we convened international experts including the World Health Organisation, Dr Ranasinghe said.
A Presidential Task Force on CKDu was set up in 2014 to provide oversight and coordinate the efforts of various sectors, agencies and ministries towards the prevention and treatment of CKDu. In this context, the World Health Organization (WHO) Country Office for Sri Lanka and Presidential Task Force jointly convened a three-day international consultation to guide future direction for addressing CKDu in Sri Lanka in 2016.
Participants comprised 54 national and international clinicians, researchers, epidemiologists, toxicologists, agriculture scientists, social scientists, hydrologists and other experts who represented the geographical and etiological dimensions of the disease. Experts came from Sri Lanka, India, the United Kingdom, Australia, Cuba, El Salvador, Finland, Sweden, Canada and Costa Rica. The International Society of Nephrology, Sri Lanka Society of Nephrology, international and national universities, public and private research institutes, National Science Foundation, Coordinating Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation, Ministry of Health and WHO were the key organisations represented.
The consultation aimed to develop consensus on research priorities and cost-effective interventions for prevention and management. The objective was to review the knowledge on CKDu globally and in Sri Lanka, identify gaps, prioritize an interdisciplinary collaborative research agenda and recommend interventions based on the available evidence. The Consultation also aimed to develop consensus on the monitoring and accountability framework for implementation of the recommendations.
Dr Ranasinghe stresses that research is vital to identify the causes of CKDu. Quite a lot of studies, experiments and research have been done to find the causes. Extensive research should continue for both preventive and curative methods as we are dealing with an unknown etiology. At present almost all Lankan universities are supporting our work. CKDu is a slowly progressive condition. It is asymptomatic until advanced stage and results in gradual loss of kidney function thus it is vital to find out the initial cause, Dr Ranasinghe said.
As Renal Disease Prevention and Research Units National Coordinator, Dr Ranasinghe is taking untiring efforts to tackle the dreadful outcome with just 14 staff in Anuradhapura. Currently we are screening people with standard methods using urine and blood. In initial stages medicine is not needed but we change the lifestyles of people. Screening is currently carried out in 12 districts for early detection and at the same time we are upgrading the curative facilities including clinics, dialysis and transplant, he explained.
Google mapping
He further added supplying of purified water, creating awareness through leaflets and educational programmes as other initiatives that are being carried out at present. The most impressive effort taken by Renal Disease Prevention and Research Unit is Google mapping of the CKDu patients of the country. With GPS mapping and CKDu surveillance any involved party can get the idea where exactly to provide RO plants, dialysis machines or other necessary equipment. All information is available on Sri Lanka Renal Registry - a live web based system and most of it is accessible for anyone interested, Dr Ranasinghe said.
Meanwhile, Presidential Task Force for Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease which was established with direct guidance and instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena enhances facilities of welfare and preventative matters to patients affected with CKDu.
According to the National Plan we facilitate and coordinate work done with regard to CKDu. Early detection of the condition and preventing the spread, facilitating treatment to the affected, welfare of the patients family and community, supplying clean drinking water, promotion of toxic free diet, developing an upgraded database and facilitating research and policy making are some of the services we provide, Presidential Task Force for Prevention of CKD, Project Coordinator, Stefhan Fonseka said.
Renal Disease Prevention and Research Unit of Ministry of Health with the support of the Task Force carried out pilot screening parallel to national programmes in Dehiaththakandiya, Wilgamuwa, Giradurukotte, Mahiyanganaya, Monaragala, Padavisripura, Gomerankadawala, Seruwawila, Morawewa, Mannar and Vauniya where most vulnerable people reside. Until the government is able to provide pipe borne water to the areas in dry zone, purified water will be provided through RO plants. Allocations are already given to Sri Lanka Navy to install and maintain the plants in identified areas, Fonseka added.
However the question is while actions are taken on priority interventions for CKDu whether the families of the deceased are taken care of. The debate will continue on the initial cause and the answer to the mystery is still years away.
While investigations are underway to identify the cause the officials agree that the provision of safe drinking water and early diagnosis are important priorities. As initial symptoms of the disease are non-distinct, people seek medical care usually late, when damage to the kidney is extensive and irreversible. The only option at this stage is dialysis, which is not always available or accessible as most of the affected are poverty stricken. Thus facilitating early diagnosis at the community level, expanding resources to enable treatment, while the detectives continue their investigations is essential.
Research
Commendable work is currently being carried with intervention of both the government and medical experts of the country. Building an International Research Centre especially for CKD research was commenced at the Peradeniya University premises with grants from Chinese Government. An MoU was signed between Ministry of Health and Chinese Academy of Sciences in October 2016 to conduct research to find the cause for CKDu. The research collaboration has already begun jointly with the Renal Disease Prevention and Research Unit of Ministry of Health, Chinese Academy of Science and National Science Foundations of both countries. As per the MoU the Chinese government will donate fully equipped, highly expensive, sophisticated state of the art mobile labs for CKD screening. Further the Chinese Academy of Sciences has coordinated training of local doctors, nurses, bio medical engineers/technicians and Public Health Inspectors from CKDu affected areas in Peking University First Hospital and Centre for Disease Control in Beijing in 2017, Consultant Community Physician of Renal Disease Prevention and Research Unit of Ministry of Health, Dr. A. Pubudu de Silva said.
He further mentioned that Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization (ANSTO) through Presidential Task Force is collaborating CKDu research with Renal Disease Prevention and Research Unit of Ministry of Health. In addition Australias Shanthi Foundation (a charity organisation) is going to establish a Palliative Care Centre for terminally ill CKD and Cancer patients in Anuradhapura. When completed it will be the first eco-friendly Palliative Care Centre in South Asia, Dr. de Silva pointed out.
The Ministry of Health has taken measures to increase the haemodialysis facilities, transplant facilities and to introduce automated peritoneal dialysis (home dialysis), Dr de Silva said. The automated peritoneal dialysis machines will capture relevant information including weight, temperature and blood pressure of the patient. Doctors can evaluate and monitor the patients from the hospital with the use of these machines, he said.
With all international assistance and future research priorities in clinical aspects: early detection, treatment and care; role of agrochemicals; role of water/heavy metals; and role of heat/stress/dehydration and miscellaneous hypotheses in mind, country hopes for a better future for CKDu patients.

LCs opened on Aug.1 not valid for tax exemption
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera told Parliament yesterday that he would bring in an amendment to prevent the Letters of Credit (LC) opened on August 1 from obtaining the tax amendment exemption on vehicles with an engine capacity of less than 1000cc.
He made this comment in reply to concerns raised by UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena who pointed out that a large number of LCs had been opened on the eve of vehicle tax revisions to give undue advantage intentionally to certain parties.
The minister agreeing with the point made by MP Gunwardena said, There had certainly been a problem. We have received information that the LCs were issued until 12 midnight on August 1 by even keeping the banks open. I will make an amendment to correct this problem, the minister replied.
The minister, defending the Governments move to increase the duty on vehicles below 1000cc, said 24,000 vehicles of this category had been imported to the country from January to May this year. He said the prices of vehicles less than 1000cc reduced by about Rs 800,000 in January because of the new tax system on vehicles introduced from the Budget 2018.
He pointed out even after the price hike the vehicles below 1000cc are still cheaper about Rs 400,000 compared to their prices in 2014. He said the Governments decision to increase the duty on vehicles was to prevent a possible risk of further depreciating the Ruppee compared to the dollar. Had not we intervened, the exchange rate of a dollar could have been Rs 167, the minister added.

A leg up for athletics
Budding sportsmen and sportswomen in the rural outback of this country, no doubt, would welcome the launch of a Special Sports Fund aimed at grooming them for international stardom one day. This special Sports Fund was launched by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with an initial allocation of Rs.50 million, in association with the National Olympic Committee, at Temple Trees on Wednesday. It will target high performance athletes who have a realistic chance of winning medals at international sporting events for the country. We must recognize outstanding sports stars and give our maximum support to develop their skills. Talented sportsmen and women in schools should be given all the encouragement, so that they will go on to represent the country in the future and bring honour and fame to the country by winning medals at international sporting events, the Premier said, speaking on the occasion. He observed that the government and the private sector should give a helping hand to develop sports in Sri Lanka.
The initiative, it is hoped, would not only groom promising sportsmen and woman to scale international heights but would also see the unearthing of hidden talent, particularly in the hinterlands, which otherwise would be left to wither on the vine. Many of our sportsmen and women, especially our athletes, who brought international fame to the country hailed from the villages. The Susanthikas, Dharshas, Kulawansas and the Dhammika Menikes who burned the tracks to international stardom were all village lasses who were discovered quite by accident. Had this fortuitous circumstances by-passed us, the country would have missed the opportunity of bagging only her second medal at an Olympics, won by Susanthika at the Sydney Olympics emulating countryman Duncan White. The feat not only put Sri Lanka on the world athletics map but also rescued the athlete from the clutches of poverty to which the family was condemned. How many more medal winners the country was denied, one could only speculate.
It is also a matter for gratification that the Special Fund will be solely dedicated to athletics. It has been the perennial complain in sporting circles that cricket was receiving all the attention and funding to the exclusion of all other sports. Not only that, we have not even seen the returning hero welcome accorded to some of our medal winning athletes at international events that has always been reserved for our cricketers. This was the case even when our cricketers have come second best as in the 2011 World Cup final defeat to India when the team received a typically heroes welcome at the BIA and hosted for receptions by the leaders of the country.
This lopsided treatment of lesser sports has not only discouraged would be champions in the field of athletics and other disciplines, but also spawned justified accusations of discrimination. After all, athletics deserved to have received more attention than it does today given that the country has produced international stars in the track and field disciplines though, admittedly, not scaled such heights as cricket.
Private sector sponsorship of athletics too is minimal though we come across instances where some commercial establishment coming forward to help out promising athletics by way of provision nutrition and incidental expenses. The Fund, therefore, would be a boon to the young athletes lacking in the wherewithal to further their aspirations.
Ideally, the private sector should involve itself in a big way to promote athletics, instead of putting all its eggs in the cricket basket. Cricket has all the money it needs and big money at that and can more than survive on its own. It is understandable though that commercial establishments look mostly for national cricketers to promote their brands, rather than athletes, given the popularity and glamour attached to the sport.
A good portion of the Special Fund should also be reserved for talent scouting. As mentioned, there may be a world champion somewhere in the denizens waiting for the knock on fate's door. In other countries there are special teams who fan out across the country to spot sporting talent. Pakistan's Prime Minister in waiting Imran Khan recounts how he spotted, a later to become one of the country's leading bowlers, from among a set of youth playing street cricket. Sri Lanka too could turn lucky and strike gold by plucking a world beater from obscurity.
The net should be thrown far and wide to harvest the talent. The north should also now be fully brought into the country's sporting ambit. With the industry and enterprise shown by the northerner in many a field, there is the very real possibility of the region providing the country with future medal winners.
The National Olympic Committee and its go-getter President Suresh Subramanium deservedly received a glowing tribute from the Prime Minister for his initiative in launching the Special Fund. Hopefully, the Fund will step into the breach to lift all the resource starved sports that have escaped the attention of the mega-sponsors of cricket and see the birth of a new breed of track and field artistes who would one day bring fame and glory to the country.

M. Kazhagam valued communal harmony: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in a condolence message over the death of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Party Leader and former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi, said that Karunanidhi played a leading role in strengthening social relations between South India and Sri Lanka, yesterday.
The cooperation he rendered in widening diplomatic relations between the two countries should be remembered. Karunanidhi will be remembered forever by the people in Tamil Nadu for his immeasurable service. I convey my deepest sympathies on behalf of all Sri Lankans for the bereaved, on his passing, he said Muthuvel Karunanidhi was a respected politician who served Tamil Nadu as its chief minister as well as the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party leader. Throughout his political career that spanned over eight decades, M. Karunanidhi won the hearts of people both in Tamil Nadu and India, the statement said.
His role in society and politics started at a young age. At the age of 14, he was already involved in social movements against the caste system in Hinduism and later, gave a voice to the movement through his contributions in the official newspaper of the Justice Party. In addition to politics, he made a significant contribution to Tamil literature and the Tamil film industry, it added.
He was a person who valued religious and communal harmony and I would like to mention an important statement he made that outlined his interest in Buddhism at the occasion of his swearing in as the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister on May 13, 2006 it said.
Most of his supporters encouraged him to change the date of his taking of oaths as the 13th was believed to be an inauspicious day, the statement added.
The Vesak procession organised by the Maha Bodhi Society of Sri Lanka in Chennai, was to be held on the same day, but he was firm in his decision to take his oath on May 13, mentioning that if the Vesak procession was to be held on that day, it would not be an inauspicious day for him to take his oath, the statement added.

When Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was Mihin Lanka Chairman, the then government had obtained a loan of Rs.1.9 billion from the Bank of Ceylon to repay a loan obtained from BOC and Lankaputhra Bank which was settled on March 31,2009.
Pradeep Wasantha Wimalasuriya, a senior BOC official submitted copies of the relevant documents to the the Presidential Commission appointed to investigate financial irregularities which had taken place at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka Airlines, yesterday to back his claim.
Wimalasuriya was cross examined by Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Pathirana.
It was revealed during the hearing that it was Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, then CEO Sajin Vaas Gunewardene and Roshan Mahesh Gunatilake who had authorised to obtain loans from BOC and Lankaputhra Banks.
Wimalasuriya also revealed that the loan was obtained not as an overdraft and also without any security for the debt.
When Rajapaksa was the Chairman, the director board comprised Sajin Vaas Gunewardene, Lalith Weeratunge, Surendra Ediriweera, Chandana Liyanarachchi and Samantha Samaratunge, the official said.

Minister Maddumabandara made these observations when Joint Opposition MP Ranjith De Zoysa inquired about the developments in the probe of the said matter.
MP Zoysa alleged that there is a political figure behind the incident.
When Zoysa directed the question to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Premier quipped as to why the Joint Opposition did not move an Adjournment Motion to debate the incident, if they are so concerned about it. He further said that the subject minister will inform about the details of the incident to the House in due time.

More buses to minimise public inconvenience
Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry sources yesterday said that a number of measures have been taken to minimise the inconvenience faced by the railway commuters due to sudden wild cat strike action launched by the Sri Lanka Railway Department trade unions. All leave of Sri Lanka Transport Board employees has been cancelled and a fleet of over 500 buses which were deployed for the transport of schoolchildren would be in operation.
According to Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry Secretary G.S. Vithanage, buses will be allowed to operate on any route to alleviate the inconvenience faced by the public and the Police have already been informed about the Ministry decision.
The Ministry Secretary added that Sri Lanka Army buses will also be deployed to transport passengers with the assistance of Army personnel. He requested the public to use alternative modes of transport until the present situation is brought under control.
Vithanage said the government has granted permission for railway commuters to travel in SLCTB buses with their railway season tickets.
SLCTB Chairman Ramal Siriwardena said a fleet of 100 buses are in operation in addition to routine service. The passengers facing any issues can contact the SLCTB on 0-11 7555555, he said.

He stressed that the Cabinet of Ministers has discussed this issue extensively and finding a solution to their demands takes time.
He requested the trade union leaders in the department not to indulge in union action in an unfair manner, inconveniencing commuters.
The minister requested trade union leaders to stop their union action as it inconveniences students sitting for the GCE Advanced level examination.

New commission to revise salaries
The government is planning to set up a Special Public Commission (PSC) to increase the salaries of public servants including the railway workers, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera told Parliament yesterday.
Minister Samaraweera also said that President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed him to prepare a Cabinet Paper to establish a new Public Service Commission to look into the salaries and wages of public sector employees.
He requested the railway workers to wait for three months to solve their issue while addressing the other salary anomalies of the public servants as well. Minister Samaraweera was participating in the Second Reading Stage debate on the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill.
The Minister also said, if an increment is given to the railway workers, it will create a chain effect in other public sector institutions.
Minister Samaraweera pointed out that if the increment is granted as per the demands of the railway workers, their salary scales would have been above the salary grades of doctors, principals and school teachers.
Therefore, I was opposed to the Cabinet meeting to give the salary increment demanded by railway workers.
It is very unfair for the railway workers to demand a pay hike only for them while the government was preparing to bring about a mechanism to give salary increments to all public sector workers, Minister Samaraweera said.
While pointing out that he has dealt with strikers for over 20 years, Minister Samaraweera further said he is willing to discuss the matter with the strikers if they are willing to go back to work first.
I am ready to talk to them if they come to the table after suspending their union action. I am not ready to talk with strikers while they continue to strike. That has been my policy for the past 20 years and it would be so in this instance too, Minister Samaraweera said.
The Minister expressed regret on behalf of the government for the inconveniences and difficulties faced by workers, students and other commuters due to the sudden strike action launched by the railway workers on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on the same subject said that issues like the railway workers one can be forwarded to the new Public Service Commission.
The Premier also said that there was no decision taken to cancel the Cabinet Paper proposing the rectification of railway workers salary anomalies.
He said more clarifications are on demand before taking a decision on the matter.
Public Administration and Management, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara speaking on the same matter, condemned the sudden railway strike which inconvenienced the students sitting for the Advanced Level Examination. He also observed that a railway drivers salary is close to Rs. 200,000 and more with the over-time payments. Minister Madduma Bandara urged the strikers to solve the matter by discussion.

New constitution for a better country
Now Professor Peiris not unsurprisingly has objected to two clauses in the proposed draft constitution which he says are prejudicial to the interests of the Rajapaksa, even though it is in the public interest. The first objection which Professor Peiris raises is to the abolition of the executive presidency, a near article of faith of the political establishment for several decades. Of the three major political parties in the country, the SLFP, the UNP and the JVP, the SLFP and the JVP have consistently opposed the executive presidency
Professor G.L. Peiris trusted acolyte and nominal head of the Rajapaksa brothers and their new political vehicle the Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP) has taken umbrage and fired warning shots across the bow of the ongoing constitutional reform process. The good professors pet peeve with the proposed new constitution is supposedly that it has been designed with malice towards the Rajapaksa brothers.
Before delving into the merits or otherwise of Professor Peiris critique of the constitutional reform process, it would be worth noting that the Constitutional Council was established by a unanimous vote in Parliament after the mandates of 2015, in the context of the widespread public acceptance that the Sri Lankan State needs to be reformed, to better serve the sovereign people of Sri Lanka. Successive Sri Lankan governments, by Sri Lankan Freedom Party (SLFP), led alliances, since 1994 has been trying to reform Sri Lankas constitution to strengthen democracy and to ensure inclusivity especially of marginalized and alienated sections of society.
Hence it was not only Presidents Kumaratunga and Sirisena who attempted and did make some constitutional reforms, namely the 17th and 19th Amendments to the constitution, but also President Mahinda Rajapaksa during his period in office had the All-Party Conference (APC) and its progeny, the All-Party Representative Committee (APRC) as an executive body and the Professor Tissa Vitharane headed committee of experts as a working group on constitutional reforms. Finally, the 18th Amendment to the constitution which President Rajapaksa did manage to enact, was all about transforming Sri Lanka from an imperfect democracy to an elected de-facto monarchy enthroning the Rajapaksa dynasty.
Restraints for presidential candidacy
Now Professor Peiris not unsurprisingly has objected to two clauses in the proposed draft constitution which he says are prejudicial to the interests of the Rajapaksa, even though it is in the public interest. The first objection which Professor Peiris raises is to the abolition of the executive presidency, a near article of faith of the political establishment for several decades. Of the three major political parties in the country, the SLFP, the UNP and the JVP, the SLFP and the JVP have consistently opposed the executive presidency.
The UNP which actually introduced this office through the 1978 Constitution, most similar to the powers of the emperor in the declining phase of the Roman Empire and notable for the complete absence of checks and balances against the arbitrary and absolute use and abuse of state power, has been the late but now staunch supporter of abolishing the executive presidency.
The proposal to de-bar anybody who has held the office of president for two terms from being elected president is strongly objected to by Professor Peiris. Now term limits are an almost universally accepted check on power and are one of the commonest features of any democratic political order. Accordingly, the SLPP / JO position of opposing term limits can only be described as defying both reason and logic.
The proposed constitutional reforms also debar dual citizens and foreign nationals who even give up their foreign citizenship from contesting for elected office for a period of one year, after such a process is complete. Such a cooling off period is eminently reasonable. The United States, for instance, the country of dual nationality of possible Rajapaksa standard bearer and brother number two Gotabhaya, (the Khmer Rouge terminology being entirely coincidental) makes naturalized citizens ineligible to be president.
The US Department of Homeland Security makes eminently clear the process required to relinquish US citizenship and for Gotabhaya backers, it should be an eye-opener that the process is not easy. Specifically, the US seeks to prevent naturalized citizens from giving up their citizenship to avoid legal jeopardy and as a means of avoiding US jurisdiction for past crimes and misdemeanours. Relinquishing US citizenship is not a unilateral step which can be taken by the citizen concerned.
The numbers game in Parliament
In the context of a protracted and seemingly futile exercise in pursuing the position of the Opposition Leader in Parliament, the informal parliamentary grouping, self-styled as the Joint Opposition (JO) claims that it has the support of seventy parliamentarians.
This self-confession of relative weakness is interesting because constitutional reform requires a two-thirds majority in a parliament of two hundred and twenty-five members and accordingly for the JO to conclusively prevent reform requires one-third of the members of the house or seventy-five members, which it lacks. So essentially if the coalition of 2015, which was basically Rajapaksas verses the rest, can agree on the contours of constitutional reform, be it abolishing of the executive presidency, electoral reform or greater devolution of power, the reforms can still be enacted.
The impending electoral contest of 2020 though looms large in the viewing lenses of the various political formations and their leaders and the proposed reforms may only be enacted after the 2020 elections.
Those elections though would provide Sri Lankans with a stark choice, a messy coalition whose good intentions translate into actions at a pace much slower than an impatient electorate demands or a return to the past, with a barely disguised fascist and militarized mono ethnoreligious regime, whose inspiration and role model as recently and publicly proposed to a key protagonist, is to be Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime.

Calling professionals to make an impact using a viable alternative President elect Pesala Karunaratna said For a nation to progress, professionals, the future decision makers of the country, needs to be actively engaged in evaluating policy especially in areas of national interest as they operate as influencers to a wider society. Thats the opportunity YPO creates for anyone with interest to serve the community. Constructive criticism is needed, but action speaks louder, hence I invite young professionals to use this platform to make a difference

Pan Asia Bank PAT tops Rs 800 mn in 1H 2018
Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC reported its best ever profit recorded in a first half in 2018 anchored by solid growth in new loans, prudent margin and asset-liability management.
For the six months ended in June 30, 2018 (1H18), the bank reported a profit after tax of Rs.819.6 million, up by a strong 33 percent from the same period in 2017.The net interest income rose by 18% on a year-on-year (yoy) basis to Rs.2.8 billion supported by better margins recorded amid the rising cost of funds. The net interest margin increased to 3.92% during this period from 3.61% in December 2017 as the bank continuously reviewed the pricing of its asset and liability portfolio and managed them efficiently. This improvement is a testament to the banks ability to recalibrate its asset portfolio from low yielding ones to high yielding ones in order to optimize the margins.
Meanwhile for the quarter ended in June 30, 2018 (2Q18), the bank reported a profit of Rs.506.8 million on a net interest income of Rs.1.5 billion compared to Rs.263.5 million profit and Rs.1.2 billion net interest income reported in the same quarter last year. The better top line performance in the 1H18 is also a reflection of relatively strong growth in new loans.
We recorded a commendable growth in our loan book during the first half of 2018 amid the many headwinds we faced during this period. I consider this achievement noteworthy because we recorded it amid a moderation in sector loan growth and rising non-performing loans, said Nimal Tillekeratne, Pan Asia Banks Director/ Chief Executive Officer.

Delimitation Committee reportPM calls for debate
Prime Minster Ranil Wickremesinghe has proposed to take up a debate on the Delimitation Committee report on Provincial Councils during the next Parliamentary session to reach an agreement on the electoral system to hold the PC Elections.
The Prime Minister had made the proposal at a party leaders meeting he chaired in Parliament yesterday. Sources said the party leaders were unable to reach any consensus on the electoral system even yesterday.
Therefore, the delimitation report is proposed to be submitted to the House by Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha on March 6 to a vote in the House. The report has to be passed by two thirds majority. Parliamentary sources said the party leaders proposed to revert to the old electoral system if the report did not receive the two thirds support.
The sources said the two thirds majority is needed even if the House wants to repeal the new electoral system to go back to the previous system.
The debate on the delimitation report will be held as proposed on August 23 or 24.
The Delimitation Committee, Kanagaratnam Thavalingam (Chairman), retired Surveyor General; Dr. Anila Dias Bandaranaike, retired Assistant Governor of the Central Bank; Prof. S.H. Hisbullah; Prof. Sangara Wijeyasandiran and retired Assistant Election Commissioner Premathilaka Siriwardena presented the report to the Minister on February 19.
The elections for the Eastern, North Central and Sabaragamuwa PCs are already due, and the term of another three PCs, the Central, Northern and North Western PCs, is due to end by September. Party leaders on July 20 agreed to schedule the PC elections on January 5, 2019 if Parliament could agree on the matters relating to the elections before the end of October.
Sajith, Wimal lock horns
Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa and National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa locked horns in Parliament yesterday forcing the Speaker to expunge their personal accusations against each other.
As the Minister and the MP clashed, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had to repeatedly order the two members to stop arguing and let him carry on the days business.
MP Weerawansa accused Minister Premadasa of hiring excess workers to the National Housing Development Authority for daily wages burdening the institution financially. Minister Premadasa said he had not recruited any worker to the permanent cadre and had not given houses the NHDA built to his close associates and family members like his predecessor did.
Premadasa then read a list of names to whom Weerawansa had given houses and their relationships to Weerawansa.
Weerawansa challenged to resign from his Parliament seat if those individuals the Minister named were still occupying those houses. He asked the Minister to come for a debate on the matter on a private TV channel. He said the Minister should resign from his portfolio for making false accusations.
The Minister said he told truth and ready to debate with the MP any time.
Speakers decision on Opposition Leader today
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya will make a special statement in Parliament today on the post of Opposition Leader, sources from the Speakers office said.
The Speaker will make the announcement at the commencement of the sittings. It was also speculated that all Government members have been asked to be present in the House today morning.
A lengthy argument on the post took place in Parliament last Tuesday.
Following that, the Speaker told Parliament that he would announce a final decision this week after consulting the party leaders and legal advisers.
The Speaker, however, agreed to allocate more time and grant more space in parliamentary committees for the Joint Opposition.
Mahinda questions SSPspromotion delay
Promoting SSP Palitha Siriwardena to the DIG rank is questionable as he has two charge sheets against him, Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said.
The Minister was responding to a question that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa asked in Parliament yesterday. The former President queried why IGP Pujith Jayasundara does not follow recommendations given by the Police Commission on promoting police officers. The Minister said the charge sheets were sent to the Police Commission for its perusal and said that according to the Establishment Code, a public servant who has charge sheets against him cannot be promoted.
The former President said it was unfair to cancel the promotion after giving it and requested the Minister to look into it. The Minister agreed to consider the former Presidents request.
You all are talking about increasing salaries of independent commission members, but what action you take against the IGP who refuses to follow the recommendations of the Police Commission Can a Head of Department reverse the decisions made by the Commission The Police Commission gives a recommendation after a careful study and it must be respected, Rajapaksa said.
Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said SSP Siriwardena was promoted to the DIG rank and it has become problematic because of the charge sheets against him.
Dayan envoy to Russia
The High Post Committee yesterday approved the diplomatic posting of Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka as Sri Lankas Ambassador to Russia.
Dr Jayatilleke appeared before the Committee for the third time yesterday and his appointment was approved, committee sources said.
The JVP and the TNA had objected to the appointment, the sources said. The Committee was chaired by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and its members John Amaratunga, Lakshman Kiriella, M A Sumanthiran, Vijitha Herath, Eran Wickramaratne, Nimal Siripala de Silva, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Mavai Senathiraja had attended the yesterday meeting.
The Committee took a detailed report from the Foreign Affairs Ministry before approving the appointment. The Committee received a petition against Dr. Jayatillekes appointment with 115 signatures of Civil Society activists and organisations.
Samurdhi for 300,000 families
Samurdhi allowance will be granted to 300,000 families before the year end, Social Empowerment Minister P. Harrison told the House yesterday.
He said the government has received approximately seven to eight hundred thousand applications requesting Samurdhi, the Minister said the rest of the applicants will be given the allowance from 2019.
The Minister said Samurdhi Development Officers will be absorbed to permanent cardre and their pensions will be assured. Samurdhi officers held a protest near the Parliamentary entry road in the morning requesting the government to absorb them into the permanent carder.
The Minister said 27,000 Samurdhi Development Officers and 4,000 Samurdhi Managers are operating in the country.
For over 23 years, Samurdhi Development Officers were used for political purposes. They were considered a voting-machine. No one has paid attention to the legality of their recruitment. We cannot resolve this matter by protesting. I will go and sit with the protesters if that way can resolve the issue. The government will stop Samurdhi Development Officers being used for political purposes, the Minister said.
Rs. 28,000 basic salary for public service by 2020: Vajira
The basic salary of an Office Staff Assistant, the lowest rank in the public service, will be Rs. 28,000 by 2020, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena said.
The Minister, responding to a question by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunwardena in Parliament yesterday, said the basic salary of the workers in this category was only Rs. 13,000 in November, 2014.
He said the pension of the retired public servants will also be increased to match these changes in the near future.
MP Gunawardena questioned the Government whether they take steps to increase the pension on par with the Rs. 10,000 interim allowance given to the public servants. He said the pensioners receive only Rs. 3,500 interim allowance and called on the government to give them the balance Rs. 6,500 with arrears as the retired public servants are facing economic hardships with increased Cost of Living and taxes.
Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said discussions are on with the Treasury and the National Salaries and Cadre Commission on increasing pension to tally with the public servants salary increments made since 2016.
He said the government rectified the pension anomalies existed since 2006 with a circular issued on June 25, 2015. He said 600,000 pensioners are in the country as at August this year.
He said the government spent Rs. 420 billion to pay public servants salaries when it assumed office, but the sum has now increased to Rs. 620 billion.
This will rise to Rs. 260 billion next year. No other government in history has given this many of benefits to the public service, he said. The Minister refuted the MP Gunawardenas claims that the government has plans to privatise certain departments as per the IMF instructions.
Do not make false accusations to mislead the public, he told the MP.
Independent commissionsfailed in their tasks - Anura Kumara
JVP leader MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday said the Independent Commissions were unable to fulfill their main objective, to de-politicise the government institutions, even after two and half years.
I would like to ask whether the independent commissions have accomplished at least a considerable progress during these two and half years. Has our public service reached the basic standards of independence Have the Police become independent Every government hides behind political revenge and compensate their supporters when they come into power. Have the commissions been able to stop it Dissanayake asked.
MP Dissanayake said the government has failed to resolve the issues faced by the grassroots. Many high profile meetings and discussions are held, but the government has failed to address the issues faced by the people, he said. Dissanayake said the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill taken up for debate does not adhere to the fundamentals of taxation.
Debate on media freedom limitedto seven minutes
The adjournment debate on media freedom by the Joint Opposition (JO), previously scheduled for two hours, limited to seven minutes due to lack of quorum of members in Parliament yesterday.
JO MP Ranjith de Zoysa moved his motion around 5.25 pm and UNP MP Sidney Jayaratne brought the attention of the House towards the lack of quorum of 20 MPs while de Zoysa was on his feet.
MP Thusitha Wijemanna at the Chair ordered to ring the quorum bell to summon the members in, but only 16 MPs remained after the bell rang for five minutes. Therefore, the House was adjourned till today.
Finance and Mass Minister Mangala Samaraweera was present in the House to reply to the motion.
MP De Zoysa in his speech criticised the government for threatening the journalists publicly by naming them. Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the government, though criticised the journalists, had not abducted them by white vans, or attacked or killed them like the previous regime did.
He said those journalists named by de Zoysa were still in their media profession without any obstruction.
That is the fundamental difference and change under the government. None of them were killed in the manner your government killed Lasantha Wickremathunga, he said.
PCs, LG Bodies under JO hinder rural development projects
Provincial Councils and Local Government bodies under Joint Opposition influence are scheming to put rural development projects such as Grama Shakthi and Gamperaliya out of action, UNP MP Ashoka Priyantha yesterday said.
He requested that Chief Ministers and Local Government Agents be instructed to assist these development projects without hindering them.
Even though the President and the Prime Minister begin many rural development projects, they will be hindered. These people will never allow to implement them properly. MP Ashoka Priyantha said.
Speaker Karu Jayasooriya said that if the allegations are true, it is a serious matter and must be inquired into.
Some Joint Opposition representatives recently elected to Local Government bodies are waiting to take the credit of these development projects. The projects should be taken under the Central Government to implement them proper properly, many MPs alleged.
MP Kavinda Jayawardena said Ja-Ela Provincial Council has rejected to allow a privately funded development project that he wanted to implement in his area.

Delay in Provincial Council Elections
Minority party leaders meet MR
Leaders of the minority parties yesterday met former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to request his support to hold the Provincial Council Elections under the old electoral system, UPFA MP Douglas Devananda said.
Speaking to the Daily News he said the minority parties made the request to prevent further delay in holding the PC elections.
Ministers Rauf Hakeem, Mano Ganesan, Rishad Bathiudeen and UPFA MP Douglas Devananda had met the former President in the Parliament complex. MPs Dinesh Gunwardena and Susil Premajayantha had attended the meeting.
The minority party leaders had told the practical difficulties in holding PC elections under the new system within a short period and said it could further delay the elections. MP Devananda said the former President agreed to discuss the issue with his group.
Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Amendment) Bill passed
The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Amendment) Bill was passed in Parliament yesterday amidst disturbance of the Joint Opposition members.
Following a division called by NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa, the Bill was passed with a majority of 64 votes, receiving 95 votes in favour and 31 against. Ninety seven members were absent. UPFA MP Douglas Devananda abstained from voting while JVP MPs were absent.
The TNA voted in favour along with the SLFP and UNP members in the government. The JO and the SLFP Group of 16 members in the Opposition voted against.
The Bill was to broaden the legal provisions to combat transnational crimes in keeping with the modern technology. Parliament took up a full day debate on the legislation on Tuesday but its passage was put off as the JO refused to extend the time of the House to conclude the debate.
When the Bill was taken up again yesterday, the JO asked for divisions twice in an attempt to sabotage its passage. However, the Bill was passed with the majority at the divisions. Justice Minister Thalatha Atukorala presented further amendments to the Bill at the third reading in line with the Supreme Court determination.

PM for increase in Independent Commission members emoluments
The Independent Commission system in place in Sri Lanka has received admiration from the entire world, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was moving a Resolution in Parliament yesterday to increase the emoluments and other allowances to Chairpersons and Members of the Independent Commissions.
The Premier pointed out that democracy has been established in the country and people are enjoying their freedoms as never before due to the Governments commitment to uphold the independence of institutions.
Today, all these strikes are mushrooming because people have freedom.
Those who get involved in strikes know that they wont be abducted by white vans and killed. Today, media freedom is thriving. Can you imagine the fate of journalists had they clamoured against the previous regime as they are doing now the Prime Minister asked.
You all are asking for elections today. The confidence on democratic elections was restored only after the setting up of an Independent Election Commission. It has more decision making powers today, the Prime Minister said replying to the JO MPs who complained of delaying elections, the Premier said.
We will definitely hold the Provincial Councils Elections. Do not have any doubts about that. We held the Local Government Elections even when the atmosphere was not favourable to the Government. We could have delayed the LG elections by giving various reasons, but we didnt do that. We lost and we accepted it. The PC elections will be conducted as soon as possible and we have to agree on the system we follow, said the PM.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa intervening at this point said elections must be held soon under whatever system. The PM replied saying that the Government prefers holding the elections to six PCs on the same day, but added that the Elections Commission Chairman will decide whether to conduct the elections in 5 or 6 PCs.
Today the entire judicial service is independent with the setup of judicial service commission. Those days, not even the Chief Justice was spared. The independence of public service has been restored. The Commissions on Bribery and Corruption and Human Rights are doing a commendable job. We asked for these independent commissions even when we were in the Opposition, but those were not given, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe commented stating that all the benefits of these institutions are for the people.
The revisions to emoluments of Independent Commission members are with retrospective effect from June 1. The monthly allowance of Rs. 100,000 paid at present to the non ex-officio Chairpersons of Independent Commissions has been increased to Rs. 135,000. Ex-officio Chairpersons will receive 50 percent of the monthly allowance paid to the other Chairpersons in addition to salaries and allowances of their substantive posts.
The Chairperson and Members of the Election Commission will be paid a special allowance equivalent to three-fourths of their monthly allowance during the period from the day an election is declared to the day the results of that election is announced.
The monthly allowance of Rs. 75,000 paid at present to the non ex-officio Members of the Independent Commissions (other than Bribery Commission) has been increased to Rs. 90,000.
The monthly allowance of Rs. 95,000 paid at present to the Chairman and Members of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption has been increased to Rs. 130,000.
Ex-officio Members of the Independent Commissions will be paid an allowance of Rs.10,000 for each meeting they attend.

Wattala Urban Council Member Nirmala Fernando and the Secretary of the Negombo Zonal Society for the National Fisheries Federation, speaking at the event said that the Negombo area Womens Fisheries Societies which had been established amidst many difficulties were an example to Womens Fisheries Societies across the island, given the way in which they have utilised and managed the monies received by their associations.

## Section: T&C

PREMASARA EPASINGHE - an all rounder of our times
Rarely is a cricketer presented in such an elegant package  cricketer, coach, master-in-charge, writer, selector, commentator and author. In PREMASARA EPASINGHE we have all this rolled in and he has deservedly become legendary for his varied talents delivered with finesse. Tony Greig the former a South African and England captain and world famous cricket commentator paid PREMASARA EPASINGHE a glowing tribute calling him Voice of cricket in Sri Lanka. No one will begrudge that.
This Old Nalandian shone in inter-school cricket debuting as wicket keeper opening batsman under one of the best batsman produced by one of the leading Buddhist institutions in the country Chandrasiri Weerasinghe, a solid and heavy scoring right hand batsman. Weerasinghe has a rare record of reeling off four centuries in a row in the 1957 inter-school cricket season. EPASINGHE remembers as a child how he fashioned his cricketing career. He say he used to throw a tennis ball against the back wall of his home and then face it, which helped take him to higher levels of the game. His cricketing idols were the greatest batsman the world has seen Sir Donald Bradman and Len Hutton, Godfrey Evans, Don Tallon and Neil Harvey.
Two of the best opening batsmen
He enjoyed a successful inter-school cricket season opening batting with two of the best opening batsmen produced by that school right handed Mithra Siriwardena and left handed Sarath Silva where he made some good scores with the highest being 79 against Dharmaraja College.
EPASINGHE was associated with Siriwardena in grand opening stand of 236 with him making 79 and Siriwardena notching up an eye catching century.
In club cricket for the University, Bank of Ceylon, Saracens and Nationalized Services, his happy hunting ground was the Colts CC ground at Havelock Park. The knock he remembers most was the 136 which he made for the Bank of Ceylon against Ceylon Insurance.
Excelling in studies
Excelling in his studies at Nalanda he passed out to the University and sported UNI colours in the same batting position and left his mark with good scores and some fantastic catches and stumpings. EPASINGHE passed out of the Vidyodaya University in 1966 obtaining a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sinhala, English, Education and History---all rolled in one!. His Professor was Dr.Clarence Noise of the Wisconcin University USA. He managed to get back to his old school Nalanda as a teacher where he acted as assistant cricket coach to the famous Gerry Gooneratne who was his coach at school and was also the Prefect of Games, especially in charge of cricket from 1966 to 1970.
His cricketing products
In that era he helped produce cricketers of the calibre of Bandula Warnapura, brothers Jayantha and Palitha Seneviratne, Leslie Narangoda, Nandadeva Perera and Daya Sirisena. Warnapura went on to become the first Sri Lankan captain when the country attained Test status in 1982. EPASINGHE also served on the Interim Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket.
As school cricket selector from in 1968 and 69 he was on the school's Indian tour in 1969. He brought in the left arm spinner from Dharmasoka, Ambalangoda Ajit de Silva who joining Ananda excelled as one of the finest left arm spinners who sported the Sri Lanka cap. He also served as media consultant at Sri Lanka Cricket on the invitation of the then President Thilang Sumathipala. EPASINGHE was also associated with the late Gamini Dissanayeke who was crickets big boss who he considers as YUGAPURUSHE  man of the era of Sri Lanka cricket.
Spotting Anura Ranasinghe
But what EPASINGHE will most treasure was the spotting of Anura Ranasinge when he was a tiny tot showing his immense talent playing softball cricket at the Kirulupone Park. He was quick to get Ranasinghe admitted to Nalanda and then showed him to that coach who had produced outstanding school, club and country cricketers Gerry Gooneratne.
Gooneratnes first glimpse of Ranasinghe was enough to convince him that here was an uncut gem and what he needs was a bit of polishing to become a batting prodigy. EPASINGHE remembers what Gooneratne told him after having a first look at Ranasinghe: EPA, this fellow is like Sathasivam. A naturally gifted batsman.
Dont change his style. To those not in the know, Sathasivam was the greatest batsman produced by the country. Gooneratnes prediction about Ranasinghe came true when he made it to the Sri Lanka team as an all rounder.
Ranasinghes career that promised records for the game was cut short and nipped in the bud when he was lured to tour Apartheid Land  South Africa with a set of rebel cricketers. His suspension called finis to career that promised a lot.
Commentating legend
However EPASINGHE was A LEGEND for his cricket commentating in Sinhala and even in English where he held listeners spell bound with his excellent command of the language and his credibility and the many aspects of the game.
We recall one of his finest moments in commentating in describing the countrys epic World Cup victory against Australia in 1976 from Lahore, Pakistan. He was nominated for this assignment by Nandasena Liyanapatabendi.
He also toured many Test playing countries  India, Pakistan, England, South Africa describing the action has it happened out in the middle and also did updates from Lords, Trent Bridge, Manchester, London Oval and also Sharjah. He is one of the pioneers in commentating on cricket in flawless Sinhala.
Stroll down memory lane
EPASINGHE taking a stroll down memory lane would recall that he was first introduced to Radio Ceylon by Mrs. Nanda Jayamanna who was in charge of SANDAYASEWYA. She in turn introduced him to the famous Livy Wijemanne who was a household name in broadcasting. It was they who wanted him to have an innings in cricket commentating which spanned a career from 1970 to 2015. He surely will remain thankful to Bandula Waturegame and Soma Rodrigo who were in charge of the Sports Service at Radio Ceylon.
In addition to his prowess in sport, he won the following titles  In 2007 he was awarded the KALASURI title by President Maithripala Sirisena for the services he rendered as a Buddhist writer kotte kalyani samagri dharma sabawa. Kotte chapter of Siamese sect bestowed on him the title DHARMASA WEDANA SURI DHARMAPRIYA.
Authored three books
EPASINGHE authored three books on cricket that were best -sellers. They were  MA DUTU CRICKET LOVA  BRADMAN YUGEYA in Sinhala and English and DHAMASARA in Sinhala and English.
EPASINGHE married Swarna Seneviratne a teacher at STAFFORD Ladies College and says she is the wind behind his wings and they were blessed with a son Bhagaya who opened batting for STCML, and daughter Apasara. It was a rare occurrence to see father and son play the role of opening batsmen for their respective schools  Nalanda and STCML.
Having associated with the great unassuming man for well over three decades as Sports Editor of the Times of Ceylon and Daily Mirror, and finally Daily News publishing his wonderful descriptions of the player and game I make bold to describe him as a man in a million and an all rounder of our times.

PRESIDENT TELLS STRIKERS TO BE HUMANE
Groups which resort to wild cat strikes to win over their rights should also think about the rights of the public in a humane manner. It is not the government but the innocent public at large who are inconvenienced by these strikes, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He made this observation participating in a ceremony at the Viharamahadevi Park, Colombo yesterday morning.
The President who said that it was the innocent poor rather than the wealthy who mostly benefit by public transport and free health services, said that he regretted the grave inconvenience faced by the public, including Advanced Level students, due to the sudden work stoppage of railway employees.
The President said anyone has the opportunity to settle issues through discussions with the government.
President Sirisena also emphasised that unlike during the past regime, his government had never used guns or bayonets against strikers or protestors, as such he would request railway employees, doctors and other professional groups planning strikes to try and resolve their problems in an intelligent and humane manner without inconveniencing the public.
The President made these observations participating in a programme jointly organised by the Sri Lanka Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation and the Sri Lanka Army to distribute 100,000 medicinal plants. Over 100 varieties of medicinal plants are to be planted in Army camps at first under this programme themed Punarudaya 60 day operation.
The plants are supplied by the Sri Lanka Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation.
A press release by the Presidents Media Unit said this new programme has been launched as one step in the march towards sustainable development.
President Sirisena further said dedication, contribution and honesty on the part of all sections of society was essential to usher in a national re-awakening. The Government was working on a set plan to increase the present 28 percent forest density to 32 percent, and programmes of this nature would stand in good stead to achieve that target.
As much as the drive to increase forest density, the government would launch a major battle to eradicate the drug menace with the help of the Armed Forces and society in general.
The President also reiterated that the death sentence would be implemented to the letter against convicted prisoners continuing the drug racket from their prison cells. This measure would be taken for the future benefit of the country and nation. The President launched the project by handing over the first medicinal plant to Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake and thereafter planting a sandalwood sapling at the Viharamahadevi Park.
Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Ayurvedia Drugs cooperation Chairman Lal Samarasinghe, Maj. Gen. Shavendra Silva and Brig. Buvaneke Gunaratne were also present on the occasion.

The general public would soon be able to rake in the benefits of the Gamperaliya and Enterprise Sri Lanka development programmes spearheaded by the United National Party (UNP), Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
He was addressing a meeting of people's representatives held at the UNP Headquarters at Pita Kotte, on August 8. All UNP Councillors attached to municipal councils, urban councils and other local councils attended the meeting.
Minister Kariyawasam said the UNP had already played a major role towards establishing good governance as well as protecting democracy in the country. Although the government had already rendered a great service towards the country and its people, its message had not been carried to the people through the media.
The Samurdhi assistance programme, which was improper and seething in corruption during the previous regime, had been reorganised and formalised to increase relief afforded to the underprivileged masses, he said.

Rail strike: thousands thrown into despair
Lakmali Jayawardena, a regular commuter said she waited for hours at the Maradana Railway Station on Wednesday evening without a train to return home to Ambalangoda.
Leaving her one-and-a-half-year-old child with her mother and grandmother, Jayawardena had come to work in the morning hoping to get home as soon as she finished, but as a result of the railway strike that was launched suddenly, she had gone home only at around 12.00 midnight.
It was passed 10 oclock when I left the Maradana Railway Station and when I reached home, it was around 12.30 am. My mother and grandmother were sitting outside the house, without even having dinner, until I reached home. And they had managed to put my child to sleep, she said.
Jayawardena had dropped the idea of getting into a bus with the hope that the trains might leave soon. Unfortunately, the strike continued despite several attempts made by the government to stop the trade unions from resorting to strike action.
My friends who went in buses told me that they were caught in huge traffic jams in Wellawatte and Dehiwala. As there was no train, I did not have an option. So I got into an intercity bus and went home, she said.
Jayawardena further said that she met so many people who were stranded without enough money to pay for an intercity bus and added that the trains are being used not by rich people, but by middle-class people who take the train because it is quick and cheap.
Strike continues for second day
On Wednesday, employees of the Sri Lanka Railway Department, including engine drivers, guards, controllers and stationmasters took part in strike action that left thousands of commuters stranded. According to the Railway Trade Union Alliance (RTUA), the cornerstone of this issue is a salary anomaly caused by a Cabinet decision.
In response to the strike action, passengers also launched a protest opposite the Colombo Fort Railway Station against the sudden railway trade unions strike. However, RTUA Co-Convener Lal Ariyaratne said that the work stoppage by the RTUA would continue as there werent any signs of the matter being resolved.
Ariyaratne said no discussion had been offered to them by any authority concerned and added that the strike would continue.
We have launched a sudden strike, which started at 3.00 pm on Wednesday and will continue until further notice, over several issues, including salary anomalies, he added.
In the meantime, Transport and Civil Aviation Secretary G.S. Withanage said yesterday that Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva informed the trade unions that he was ready to have a discussion with them in order to bring an end to the strike.
But it looked like they still wanted to continue with the strike, despite the ministers willingness to engage in a discussion, he said.
Withanage explained that the Ministry forwarded a Cabinet paper requesting approval to rectify the salary anomalies of railway employees. However, the Cabinet decided to suspend consideration of the request as it can create issues to the salaries of the other public servants as well.
General Manager of Railways S.M. Abeywickrema said that he received a letter at around 4 pm on Wednesday from the Supervising Managers stating that they were going to join the strike. We do not have the authority to decide on salary anomalies. The government has to solve this problem, he said.
He said that the Minister had asked the strikers to stop the strike and come for a discussion.
Initiatives taken by Transport Ministry
Thousands of people were stranded following the unannounced strike and according to Withanage, the Transport Ministry has decided to take necessary action to make sure that people travel without any inconvenience.
The ministry has also requested the private sector to deploy buses even though they do not possess route permits.
He said that the government has also cancelled the leave of all SLTB employees.
Furthermore, the Finance Ministry announced that special bus services have been provided to facilitate train commuters who were stranded due to the train strike and that private buses would operate on any route regardless of route permits.
The ministry said in a statement that train commuters were permitted to travel on SLTB buses using their train tickets or season tickets, until the railway trade union strike concludes
The statement said the government would repay the cost incurred by the Sri Lanka Transport Board for providing the special bus service. The statement added that the government requested all the trade unions to come for discussions after stopping the strike.
A special bus service by the Army was deployed to transport students sitting for the GCE Advanced Level Examination.
In the meantime, Abeywickrema said that 10 trains operated from Colombo Fort Railway Station using technical supervisors yesterday.
[Rail commuters speak]
Aruna Jayasinghe (39) from Gampaha
People speak a lot about peace and unity. It is for something like this that people should unite and fight for our rights. We all saw how people were stranded yesterday.
The railway unions continued their strike regardless of what people were going through. The politicians are also the same. They dont care for the betterment of the public. All they want is money, fame and power. I dont even know how Sri Lanka would see development if it continues to march in this manner.
M. Chandrasiri (55) from Gampaha
It is very wrong for the railway unions to blame the government totally. Even if the measures taken by the government were unfair to the employees, they can never justify the strike they launched on Wednesday.
Dilmini Abeyratne (27) from Moratuwa
The employees are paid to provide a better service to people and not to put them in trouble. It seems in Sri Lanka all the public services are the same, no proper system is being implemented. The public services are no more for the public. It is used to fulfill petty motives of the trade unions and politicians.
An announced, the strike launched by the trade unions showed the public their true colours. It was such a selfish move by them.
Ruchira Ariyaratne (28) from Kalutara
It was past 12 am when I left the Colombo Fort Railway Station on Wednesday and got home early in the morning. But I am happy that the commuters were able to show some kind of objection to the measures taken by the trade unions.

Train plays an important part in the lives of many people who travel every day to work and school. Even though the strike started at 3 pm on Wednesday, the relevant officials and politicians have not been able to find a solution to the issue.
I was coming after work and saw that commuters had surrounded the railway station to object the strike. And their only demand was to arrange a train for them to go home. Some people acted violently, as they couldnt control their anger over the situation. Around 9.30 pm on Wednesday, the people were still near the station looking for ways to get back home. It was at 10.30 pm that the government deployed the Army with buses.
Even in that situation, something very interesting that happened was that a group of young people arrived at the station and distributed water bottles and biscuits to the people who were stranded.

Robots replace waiters in China restaurant
The little robotic waiter wheels up to the table, raises its glass lid to reveal a steaming plate of local Shanghai-style crayfish and announces in low, mechanical tones, "Enjoy your meal."
The futuristic restaurant concept is the latest initiative in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's push to modernise service and retail in a country where robotics and artificial intelligence are increasingly being integrated into commerce.
Raising efficiency and lowering labour costs are the objectives at Alibaba's "Robot.He" diners, where waiters have been replaced by robots about the size of microwave ovens, which roll around the dining room on table-high runways. "In Shanghai, a waiter costs up to 10,000 yuan ($1,500) per month. That's hundreds of thousands in cost every year. And two shifts of people are needed," said Cao Haitao, the Alibaba product manager who developed the concept.
"But we don't need two shifts for robots and they are on duty every day."
The diners are attached to Alibaba's new Hema chain of semi-automated supermarkets, where grocery shoppers fill their "carts" on a mobile app and have the merchandise brought to them at checkout via conveyor tracks on the ceiling, or delivered straight to their homes. Alibaba now has 57 Hema markets in 13 Chinese cities, all of which will eventually feature the robotic restaurants. Industry experts say they serve more as showcases of Alibaba's tech prowess than a serious business model in a country where labour costs are relatively low.
But the restaurants also typify the rapid adoption of new technologies in a country where the government is increasingly using facial-recognition technology to police streets and identify law-breakers.

Rs. 7,000 bn needs to be paid as loan installments,interest - IRD Chief
Inland Revenue Commissioner General (IRD) Ivan Dissanayake said Sri Lanka will have to pay Rs.7,000 billion as installments and interest for the next three years for loans taken by the country from foreign countries and organisations. He said the government has no option other than increasing tax revenue to repay loan installments and interest.
The Commissioner General was addressing a seminar aimed at educating the public on the Inland Revenue Act 2017 effective from April 1.The seminar was held at Rose Garden Hotel in Kadawatha. State revenue is estimated to be Rs.2,200 billion for this year and the expenditure is estimated to be Rs. 2,152 billion. Rs.1950 billion out of State revenue has to be paid for foreign loans as instalment obtained by the country. Rs.852 billion has to be paid as loan instalments too, he said. Dissanayake added that the estimated State revenue is not sufficient to even pay the instalment and interest of loans that the country had taken from foreign countries. The Government requires funds to create employment opportunities for youth, construction of expressways and hospitals.The government should tax incomes from those who earn more, he said.

Sampanthan to remain Opposition Leader: Duminda
R. Sampanthan would continue to be the Opposition Leader since there had been no controversy regarding his post, Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister and SLFP National Organiser Duminda Dissanayake said on Tuesday. He made those observations at a press conference held at the Anuradhapura Irrigation Ministry office.
The minister said that the issue surrounding the appointment of the Opposition Leader was being used as a political strategy by the Joint Opposition itself, adding that the Joint Opposition was divided over the nomination of the next Presidential candidate, with Rajapaksa aiming to be part of the competition recently as well. He said that politician Kumara Welgama announced that retired ex-Army officers would not qualify as candidates.
"Even within the law, it had been proven that they cannot compete at Presidential elections," Dissanayake added. He said that the Joint Opposition, in order to conceal their political incompetence, had proposed MP Dinesh Gunawardena as the next Opposition Leader. "They have been converting their own interior problem into a national issue, exaggerating it in order to deceive the public," Minister Dissanayake said.
The Minister made an open invitation to the members of the Joint Opposition who were "politically-matured enough," to understand the direction of a true and just political stream in the country as well as for the masses to come forward daringly, without boosting or slaving for one family similar to Kumara Welgama and others like him.
Dissanayake added that President Maithripala Sirisena wanted all SLFPers to unite as one, while being faithful to the party's hierarchy. "Certain politicians have been using the Presidents leniency against him in order to achieve their own personal agendas," Minister Dissanayake said.

Thisara and Shanaka redefine roles for WC
PALLEKELE, Thursday: Two players who could play key roles in the World Cup squad next year Thisara Perera and Dasun Shanaka redefined themselves with all-round performances that contributed to Sri Lanka breaking a losing streak of 11 consecutive losses to South Africa.
Perera and Shanaka both scored aggressive half-centuries contributing massively to Sri Lankas score of 306-7 and when South Africa began their run chase for 191 of 21 overs played crucial roles on the field to restrict them to 187-9 to give Sri Lanka an exciting three-run win on the Duckworth/Lewis rain rule at the Pallekele International Stadium on Wednesday.
Perera captured two important wickets as South Africa pressed for victory and Shanaka got rid of Reeza Hendricks who had scored a match-winning hundred in the third ODI and more importantly ran out JP Duminy with a direct throw from mid-off which could be regarded the turning point of the match. As long as Duminy who is a great finisher was at the crease South Africa looked like running away with the match.
Shanaka who scored his maiden ODI fifty and won the Man of the Match award was playing his first match in nearly two years.
A year is a long time. In that time I worked hard on my batting, bowling and fielding. Whats really important to all three is fitness, and I worked hard on that, said Shanaka.
The coaching staff deserves the credit. Everyone who is working on our fitness gives us a lot of support to raise our level. We have to step up a level, and what the coaching staff does is try to help us achieve that. I think we can achieve something in time to come, so we have to continue what we are doing, he said.
Actually what I had wanted to do was to support Thisara, because he is the best death-overs batsman in Sri Lanka - he can hit a six at any time. I wanted to stay with him till the end and play that supporting role. When he started batting well, I got a few loose balls. When they tried to bowl short at him, they also bowled short at me, so I was able to hit sixes. I was able to score the runs that I did because I batted in support of Thisara.
Perera who shared a record 109-run stand for the seventh wicket with Shanaka said, As soon as Dasun came I told him that we shouldnt stop playing our shots. We are both positive batsmen. We planned three overs by three overs at the start. And then after a while we realised that we were seeing the ball well. So we decided on a target of 280, but we both batted well.
Dasun was especially good at hitting boundaries, so we were able to pass 300. A 100-run partnership is not easy, because their bowlers were bowling well and we had lost six wickets already. But as soon as Dasun came I told him lets try and hit straight in the first few overs and get ourselves set, and then see after that.
Were very happy as a team because even though we have lost the series, we played with a lot of enthusiasm to prevent a 5-0 result. We had momentum since the morning. We had a good start, and then Dasun and I were able to finish well. Even the bowling was good, because 190 is a very easy target given the wet conditions, especially after they had hit 21 in the first two overs. But somehow we won the match, Perera said.
Perera who has improved as an all-rounder in recent times working with the support staff said his main goal is to bring back the World Cup to Sri Lanka.
Not just as a bowler, but as a player my one goal is to bring the World Cup back to Sri Lanka. I was in the T20 team that won the World T20. If I play well, Ill be able to do something for the team. Individual milestones will take care of themselves, said Perera.
What I want is to take the team forward. Even the wickets and runs that I do get - I cant do that alone. Someone has to take the catches. I dont like to play individual cricket. When I go to the ground I get everyones support. The main target is to win the World Cup.

## Title: Underwater myth of  Hambantota Port deal

Underwater myth of  Hambantota Port deal
A 1.12-billion-US-dollar agreement, a 99-year lease and debt diplomacy are some of the flashy words weaving different stories about the Hambantota Port Project between China and Sri Lanka.
But what is really happening under the turbulent waters of the maritime port And if it is commercially run by a joint venture, then who has the final say
In short, the Hambantota Port is under the Sri Lankan sovereignty. The much trumpeted security concerns over the commercially-run port by a Chinese company are invalid, as the Sri Lankan Government recently moved its Southern Naval Command to the facility.
There is no need to be frightened as the security of the Hambantota Port will be under the control of Sri Lanka Navy, this was stated in a statement by the Sri Lankan Prime Minister Office issued in June. It clarified that Sri Lanka and its people own control over the Port and refute allegations that a Chinese Colony is being built there.
But how to run the commercial port, share the benefits and provide security
Chinese and Sri Lankan joint ventures will operate the Port and share revenues. When it comes to security, Sri Lanka has full responsibility and control.
All these have been guaranteed by a Five-Party Agreement reached by China Merchants Port Holdings (CMPort), Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), the Sri Lankan Government, Hambantota International Port Group (Private) (HIPG) and Hambantota International Port Services Company (Private) (HIPS).
An item often overlooked in some media reports is that the China Merchants Port Holdings (CMPort) needs to invest up to 1.12 billion US dollars in Hambantota Port and relevant sea logistic business under the agreement.
Under this deal, the Chinese side holds a 70-per cent stake in two joint ventures and the Sri Lankan side holds the rest 30 per cent. After ten years, the Sri Lankan side will gradually purchase an additional 20 per cent stake, resulting in the two sides owning an equal share of 50 per cent each.
Why does Hambantota Port matter
Colombo, the commercial capital and largest City of Sri Lanka is too busy to deal with seaborne trade routes. Sri Lanka needed a new economic growth engine and Hambantota Port, with its proximity to the worlds busiest shipping lanes, proved to be a good option.
Commercial activities at the deep-sea port are expected to trigger economic development for Sri Lanka.
Back in 2005, constructing a new Port in Hambantota and connecting it to the Capital Colombo via a planned industrial belt was prioritized in the Mahinda Vision for the Future, which was proposed by Former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa. It aims to transform Sri Lanka into a hub for sea transport, aviation, business, energy and knowledge.
How feasible and practical is it to build the Hambantota Port
The Sri Lankan Government has carried surveys and research regarding that matter in previous years.
During the time of Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, Danish Engineering Consultancy Firm Ramboll did the first feasibility study, without finishing it. Another top Engineering Consultancy firm, SNC Lavalin from Canada, completed another study in June 2003.
In 2004, Ramboll was back in the picture and completed the study in 2007. This was under the second term of Chandrika Kumaratunga.
The conclusion of two feasibility studies under two different governments is clear and convincing to Build the Hambantota Port.
For years, many observers have spoken of Indias worry over the Chinese presence in the Hambantota Port. But separating facts from fiction is essential.
Sri Lanka had first looked to India for assistance to develop the Hambantota Port, but India declined.
A flourishing Hambantota Port, together with the booming Port of Colombo, will be strong competitors to Indias Maritime Facilities. Despite investing in Sri Lanka, India needs more FDI and loans to develop its own infrastructure.
But Chinas assistance with the project was subject to severe criticism from India and the West, even when Indian automobile exports to Sri Lanka were the first batch of goods when the Port opened for business.
Is that fair
Lower costs, promising benefits
To win the contract of constructing the Hambantota Port, many countries together with international contractors and financial institutions competed. Chinas solution offered the best deal.
The actual building cost was lower than the engineering estimates in the feasibility reports by both Ramboll and SNC Lavalin.
In December 2011, the first phase of the Hambantota Port was completed and entered service in 2012.
But some critics said, Look! Only 34 vessels docked in 2012. With tens of thousands of ships passing by along the worlds busiest shipping lanes. The Port failed.
But 2014 proved to be a better year. A whopping 335 vessels docked at the Port as the second phase was under construction. The Port made an operating profit of 900 million rupees (5.66 million US dollars) in 2014 and 1,200 million rupees (7.55 million US dollars) in 2015. As for the loan costs and repayment, the total cost of financing the Hambantota Port (capital plus interest) will be 1,761 million US dollars by the time the loan expires in 2036. By the end of 2016, nearly 500 million US dollars of this total amount had already been repaid. There was never any problem about meeting the payments for the Hambantota Port because it was paid out of the profits of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), according to Mahinda Rajapaksa, former Sri Lanka President.
In addition to the Hambantota Port, China will also set up an Industrial Zone in the facility. It is hoped that the industrial zone will be an engine to drive the economic development of Sri Lanka and attract investors from all parts of the world.
Sri Lanka has borrowed from the US more than China. These loans are in the form of International Sovereign Bonds, Treasury Bonds and Treasury bills which have had investors from the US and the West. So if at Sri Lanka was going to get into trouble, it was not because of the Chinese debt alone, but because of all the debts, said Ajith Nivard Cabraal, former Governor of Sri Lankan Central Bank in an interview in June this year.
Indeed, Sri Lankas debt problems mainly result from under development, historical and external reasons.
Sri Lanka issued Seven Sovereign Bonds worth 5.5 billion US dollars between 2007 and 2014. One major portion of the external debt is in the private sector and banks. They are mainly commercial and non-preferential loans with higher interest rate.
Then who owns them and how much debt does Sri Lanka owe to China
According to the 2017 Annual Report of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the Countrys total external debt was 51.824 billion US dollars, among which outstanding Chinese loans took up only about 10.6 percent or 5.5 billion US dollars. Besides, 61.5 percent of the Chinese loans (3.38 billion US dollars) are concessional ones, with a much lower interest rate than the international market.
According to Sri Lankas Finance Ministry Annual Report 2017, market borrowings mainly of Sovereign Bonds accounted for 39 per cent of the Countrys external debt. Loans owed to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) were 14 per cent, Japan 12 per cent, the World Bank 11 per cent, China 10 per cent and India 3 per cent.
Clearly for sure, the biggest issue in Sri Lanka is borrowing from global finance capital or the seemingly innocent international capital markets, which charge much higher interest rates. The capital markets are mainly in the US and European countries.
The opportunity lost by Ceylon (Sri Lanka) was gained by Singapore.
Singapore was not built in a day, so is Sri Lankas National Development Plan.
Situated along one of the busiest shipping lanes, Sri Lanka surely has abundant advantages to achieve an economic leap. But it needs to catch up.
Dubai in the UAE and Shenzhen in Southern China became economic miracle through decades of continuing input, strong leadership and stable policy and innovation. So does the Hambantota Port and industrial Park nearby. The giant facility will generate a larger foreign exchange flow into Sri Lanka through Maritime Services and positively impact the foreign reserves of the country. But they need encouragement, not bias.
Empty talks would lead the country astray. Only hard work can rejuvenate the nation

US Peace Corps to return to Sri Lanka
The United States and Sri Lanka have renewed an agreement to re-establish a Peace Corps programme in Sri Lanka through the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding at the Education Ministry yesterday.
US Embassys Charge daffairs Robert Hilton said they were humbled by the level of support shown during the last two years since the talks on the reinstatement of the peace corps resumed.
Today represents a renewal not a new agreement, he said adding that youth mastering the English language would significantly enhance Sri Lankas economic opportunities.
Peace Corps efforts in Sri Lanka will focus on English language education. Once in Sri Lanka, volunteers are to undergo three months of comprehensive cultural, language and technical training before they are given their assignments to serve for two years.The first 25 Peace Corps Volunteers are scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka in late 2019.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said it was Sri Lanka who extended an invitation to the US Peace Corps to return to Sri Lanka. He thanked the Prime Minister for his initiative to reinstate the programme. Education Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi said nearly 49% of students who sat for the G.C.E Ordinary Level Examination last year had failed English which was a worrying sign.
Hence, this programme, he said will support the development of capacity of the English language teachers in Sri Lanka and the programmes volunteers will be accommodated in secondary schools, local English support centres and vocational training centres.
Peace Corps volunteers live and work alongside the people they serve, collaborating with local government, schools, small businesses and entrepreneurs to create community based projects that address local development priorities across many sectors. Earlier this year, acting Peace Corps Director Sheila Crowley and Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana signed an agreement to re-establish the programme in Sri Lanka. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives Atul Keshap witnessed the signing at Temple Trees.
From 1962 to 1998, more than 370 Peace Corps volunteers served in Sri Lanka, working in education, health and youth development.
The programme was closed in 1998. Peace Corps Crisis Corps, now Peace Corps Response, returned to Sri Lanka to support relief efforts in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. In 2016, the Government of Sri Lanka invited Peace Corps to return to work and assist in furthering the countrys development goals.
