Mirror of the Age forum
Colombo theatre forum is a space created for those who are seeking new dimensions in Sri Lankan theatre. Scholars, Directors, Script writers, Actors and Actresses, Critics, Lighting Directors, Back stage creators, Stage managers, students and spectators can join this forum to widen their horizons in the field of theatre.
Colombo Theatre forum organised by Inter Act Art theatre and Goethe - Institut Sri Lanka was recommenced last July with the Participation of many young theatre lovers and foreign delegates. The forum will be held on the last Tuesday of this month at the Goethe Institut Hall at 5 pm.
The forum of this series is titled Mirror of the Age. This documentary film and the discussion will take place on February 27. The curators are M. Safeer and Hemantha Prasad.
East Germany is a theatre paradise. Sixty state subsidized theatres played for a potential 16 million spectators and the artists, with life contracts, enjoyed a social security that artists in other countries only dream of. Moreover, the prestigious theatrical tradition in the GDR, founded on Bertolt Brecht's political and aesthetic concept of a
"Theatre of the New Age", lent the productions their distinctive profile and mounded productions from the highest artistic level.
The socialist state be jeweled itself with its theatre culture but it also upheld the doctrine that art was not just a commodity but a human right.
Theatre makers in the GDR were determined to make the most of their allotted roles. But the more the state instigated gap between reality and the ideal widened, the more the theatre found itself caught in a conflict between fellow-travelling and opposition.
In recent years, the theatre in the GDR assumed the role of "the conscience of the nation", an unusual role which it took on with responsibility and played with strength. The theatre that Brecht had enjoyed "to change the world", now took his instruction at its word.

MR should be appointed Opposition Leader
Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa should be appointed the opposition leader of Parliament, Joint Opposition members said in Parliament, yesterday.
Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma said the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) was the only opposition in the world that attempted to protect the government.
They made these observations during a press conference headed by Joint Opposition Member Chamal Rajapaksa which was held at Committee Room number 4 in the Parliamentary Complex, yesterday.
MP Dullas Alahaperuma said the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Secretary General and Deputy Speaker had stated that they had decided to quit the unity government. As the unity government was established for two years, the agreement is no longer valid. "The agreement expired one month and 19 days ago," MP Alahapperuma said, "There is a Constitutional issue since there are more than 30 ministers and state ministers against the agreement."
He added that with the election results, political and economic issues have been aggravated, creating instability in the country.
He also said that according to the new election law introduced by the government within the 340 local government institutions, a party which secured 50 percent or more could nominate the chairman. It removed the bonus seats for the winning parties.
"The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) won 232 institutions and out of them, we have no issue in establishing power in 153 institutions. But in 92 particular institutions, it is impossible for all parties to set up power." He added that even the TNA's popularity has dropped as Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) has been able to secure power.
Joint Opposition MP Kumara Welgama said that when they met President Maithripala Sirisena, the latter said he needed to refer to the Constitution before establishing another government under another Prime Minister.
JO members Keheliya Rambukwella, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Wimal Weerawansa, Dullas Alahapperuma, Chamal Rajapaksa, Udaya Gammanpila, Kumara Welgama, Bandula Gunawardena, and Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena were present at the meeting.

AISEX 2018 begins on May 10 at BMICH
Bringing together suppliers and service organizations in the apparel industry in Sri Lanka, the Apparel Industry Suppliers Exhibition (AISEX) will be held from May 10- 12 at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Center (SBMEC).
Organized and managed by Lanka Exhibition & Conference Services in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Apparel Institute (SLAI), organizers hope it would be the platform in which the future development of the industry as a major sourcing and knowledge hub for the apparel sector by 2020 would come to fruition.
Held biannually since the year 1998, the 9th edition of AISEX 2018 will bring together a wide range of players, big and small, focused on the development of the industry together.
Reinvigorated by the provision of GSP plus, the apparel industry is on the brink of taking every foreseeable step in a bid to take full advantage of the benefits allowed under the scheme. This is a benefit that is time stamped. As the country develops and reaches a higher Per Capita Income, we will lose this opportunity. The time is now to make full use of what is given to us, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Apparel Institute Professor Lakdas Fernando said. Set in this backdrop, the Apparel Industry Suppliers Exhibition aims to bring all suppliers Big and Small and service organizations in the sector under one roof and will focus on a wide range of textile machinery, accessories and services from many parts of the world.
AISEX will provide manufacturers of all sizes a platform to expand existing manufacturing methods and possibilities of increasing production volumes and efficiency through state of the art innovative technology. AISEX will also focus on generating new opportunities closer to home for small scale local designers and manufactures. The Event will feature a sourcing Market / Pavilion where small to medium scale manufactures, suppliers and designers can meet and source each others skills and products.
The 9th edition of AISEX sets out to attract innovators and trend setters both domestic and overseas to access, meet, learn and experience.
There would be a number of knowledge sharing sessions held alongside the exhibition and well known personalities from the Industry will speak & share their perspectives, followed by open panel discussions and Forums.

For the first time the hotel will be offering a package that includes four meals and an extended check out time in a bid to offer longer stay at the hotel for guests.
It takes around six hours to get to the hotel due to the lack of a highway and if the guests have to check out at the usual time of 12 noon on the following day it would not be a holiday. Hence we have decided to offer them a late check out giving them the option of checking in for breakfast (for travelers who use the night train) or check out after dinner, said Group General Manager of the hotel, Indrajith Kumara.
Under the second phase of development the management is looking to build a second wing with another 20 rooms to offer it for the mid travel segment. A spa too would be introduced. We will also introduce a larger conference facility to meet the growing demand for MICE events.
Spread across an area of over six acres and with two swimming pools, Anilana Nilaveli is one of the heavily invested hotels in the entire North East. Owned and managed by Anilana Hotels and Properties Ltd the total investment for the project was Rs. 1.5 billion. The hotel has 54 luxurious rooms which includes 27 deluxe rooms, 18 pool chalets, six studios and three suites.
Most of the furniture and other amenities have been imported form USA to add more luxury to the property. Amenities of the hotel include flat screen LED TV with cable channels, writing table, and personal safe and personal bar. Complimentary tea and coffee are available with a personal coffee machine.
We also organise weddings, honeymoon parties, Beach weddings with Dancers, Drummers and Elephants, anniversary dinners, special events, family gatherings, parties and meetings. We can also custom design packages that are tailor made to suit your requirements. Nothing is too small nor is any challenge too big. Intimate moonlit dinners for two under the stars in the beach too are very popular.
The hotel also offers visits to places of interests that include excursions to Fort Frederick built by the Portuguese in the 17th century, grand Koneswaram Temple on Swami Rock cliff, Gokanna Temple, hot springs. In addition dolphin and Whale watching packages, diving, snorkeling water sports and boat tours too are offered.

The multi-talented singer and actress rose to prominence in 1992 when she released debut album Whats the 411 and has since gone on to find success with songs such as Be Without You, Real Love, No More Drama and Family Affair.
Though it has been a long time since she first released some of her singles, Mary has insisted that she still puts her heart and soul into each and every performance she gives.
If Im onstage every single night, it cant just be for my fans. It obviously is for me, too, she told New York magazine. Im going to feel it like it was the first day. Im going to relive No More Drama. I dont have a choice. These things really happen, so they just turn up again. And if its healing for someone else, its therapy for someone else, itll be therapy for me as well.
In addition to her singing career, Mary has won acclaim for her recent acting roles, including a part in TV show How to Get Away with Murder and an Oscar-nominated turn as Florence Jackson in Dee Rees period drama Mudbound, which tells of two World War II veterans who return to rural Mississippi each to address racism and Post-traumatic stress disorder in his own way.
When it came to portraying Florence, the mother of one of the soldiers, Mary was inspired by the inner strength of her grandmother and the aspects of her tough childhood.
Everything we saw, we couldnt say - so that was in me. My mother said whatever she wanted, but my grandmother was just a very reserved woman, very reserved but very powerful. Because you can end up in trouble if you said too much. I mean, Dee saw that. Thats my personality, the 47-year-old shared.

Champika wants SLPP supporters reined in
The relevant authorities should intervene to stop acts of post election violence in the country since Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP) supporters have come on to the streets after their victory to destroy cut outs of government party candidates and threaten and even assault people who supported United National Front candidates, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patlai Champika Ranawaka said.
He was addressing a meeting at the residence of United National Front candidates Dharuska Ramanayake who contested the Maharagama UC elections.
Minister Ranawaka asked as to what precedent SLPP supporters were trying to set for the people of the country.
It gave a preview of the mayhem the SLPP and its supporters would set if by chance the SLPP took up reins of government.
It also proved that the SLPP was trying to reverse the era of law and order and discipline ushered in by the Good Governance government and take the country back to the dark era, Minister Ranawaka said.
This was quite in contrast to the two earlier elections held in the country.
Eventhough there was no Election Commission at the time of the 2015 Presidential election and the General Election, members of the government never allowed their supporters to damage the cut outs of members of the previous regime, including the former President or Minister Basil Rajapaksa or threaten or intimidate their supporters. As such he would request the law enforcement authorities act firmly against persons resorting to post election violence, Minister Ranawaka said.
They had already collected information regarding some of these incidents and brought them to the notice of the Elections Commission and other relevant sections, the Minister added.

Changing heads not the solution - GL
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G.L.Peiris yesterday said that changing heads was not the solution to the current political issue in the country.
He said that changing the Prime Minister or any other person for that matter will not solve the current issue.
He said the people had rejected the Government's policies at the last election and the rulers should respect the publics wish and call for an immediate general election. Addressing Journalists in Colombo, Peiris said the SLPP had won a clear majority at the concluded Local Government election.
He further said in order to respect the peoples mandate, the Government should dissolve Parliament and call for a General election to allow the public to choose a new government.

Response to Ephrem Fernando
Not meant for anyone!
Any human being with even the least amount of intelligence understands that alcoholism and smoking are killers. The only issue is that, some act on that intelligence and make a conscious choice to become teetotallers, while some, even while being fully aware of its adverse repercussions, keep poisoning themselves. So far, Fernandos logic is absolutely faultless and any human being in her/his right mind would laud him for saying what he says in his article, Not meant for ladies!
Still, as the article progresses, a deep shadow is cast over this valuable and timely message; the shadow of a deeper shade of benevolent patriarchy and sexism, dangerously coated in culture.
First and foremost, pubs are bad for both men and women. Its not especially bad for women. However, the article sadly emphasizes how a drinking woman belongs to a worse breed than a drinking man. It also completely homogenizes a class of wealthy women. This makes his approach to this complex topic rather simplistic, as it puts all women of wealth into a constricted category and typecasts their behaviour. No human being can be absolutely categorized in this manner without losing out on the heterogeneity of the complex society we live in.
On the day of their marriage, not only a woman but a man too makes vows. Then why is a husband who comes home drunk and beats up his wife let go quite easily in Sri Lankan culture, under the great illogic of men will be men, while a woman drinking a glass of wine is bad for culture Which culture Whose culture
And if the idyllic and nostalgic Victorian dream of the yesteryear stay-at-home mother is to continue, that has to be done on the funeral pyres of all professional women who believe that they too can participate in the basic human rights of educating themselves, finding professional success and leading their own independent lives. According to this mindboggling formula of Good mother=A stay-at-home mother, my mother would have been a bad mother. But no. She was a working mother and she raised me into becoming the independent, free-thinking, educated and humane woman I am today.
And I am sorry Ephrem Fernando, no matter how many children I may have, the last thing I would do is to sacrifice my life and my dreams and constrain my life at home in the name of motherhood!
Prescribing different rules for men and women is called sexism and gender-discrimination. Besides, let the jungle have its own laws. I am a woman and a human being. Not an elephant!

Coleman breaks 60m indoor world record
LOS ANGELES: Rising US star Christian Coleman set a new world indoor record for the 60m on Sunday, blasting to victory in 6.34sec at the US championships in Albuquerque.
The 21-year-old exploded out of the blocks with a 0.149 reaction time to cross ahead of Ronnie Baker, who was second in 6.40.
Colemans time shaved 0.05sec off the existing world indoor record set by Maurice Greene in Madrid in 1998.
It comes after a roller coaster start to the season for Coleman, the world 100m silver medallist.
The American youngster was initially believed to have broken Greenes 60m record at a meeting in Clemson, South Carolina on January 19, where he clocked 6.37sec. However that time was not ratified because the meeting at which took place was not using electronic starting blocks.
Coleman set prodigious times as a college athlete and has been hailed as a potential Olympic champion. AFP

Delimitation Report for PC elections handed over to Minister
The Delimitation Report for the Provincial Council elections was handed over to Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha yesterday (19).
The Minister last year received Parliamentary approval for the Provincial Council Elections (Amendment) Act No 17 2017 to hold the provincial elections under the new electoral system where 50 percent of the seats allocated would be under the First Past the Post System and 50 percent under the Proportional Representation system.
The committee appointed to prepare the delimitation report thus took into consideration this new system.
Releasing a statement to the media, the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils pointed out that the recommendations of the report were discussed at length with the committee and the minister and informed them that he wished to present the report to an all party conference first prior to submitting it to Parliament.
Gaining views from all political parties represented in Parliament and those outside of it will allow for lesser number of amendments in Parliament, the Minister said.
The Committee had prepared the report in a matter of four months and the Minister is expected to present the Bill for Parliament approval within the next two weeks.
The Delimitation Committee comprised of the five members; Dr.K.Thavalingam (Chairman), Prof. S.H.Hasbullah, Dr. Anila Dias Bandaranayake, P.M.Siriwardena (former Additional Elections Commissioner) and S. Vijayasandiran (Peradeniya University, Head of Department of Economics and Statistics).

Doping case extremely disappointing if proven -- IOC
Pyeongchang, Monday: A doping case involving a Russian curler at the Pyeongchang Olympics would be extremely disappointing if proved true, the International Olympic Committee said Monday.
Its extremely disappointing for us if a case is proven, IOC spokesman Mark Adams said after a curler from the Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) delegation was implicated in the second doping scandal to hit the Games.
A spokesman for the OAR in Pyeongchang told Russian media that an A sample showed a possible violation of anti-doping rules and a B sample would be tested later Monday.
A fresh doping case would be deeply embarrassing for Russia, which was banned from the Pyeongchang Olympics over state-sponsored doping. But 168 Russian athletes deemed clean are competing as neutral Olympic Athletes from Russia.
If the case is confirmed, it will come before the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is handling doping matters at the Olympics and has an ad hoc division in Pyeongchang.
It would also be considered by the panel which will ponder whether to end Russias ban as early as next week.
The IOC suspended Russia in December after revelations of a widespread and highly orchestrated doping conspiracy, which first emerged before the Rio 2016 Summer Games. AFP

Ex-Cyclone Gita: New Zealand's South Island declares state of emergency

Christchurch on New Zealand's South Island has declared a state of emergency as former cyclone Gita approaches the country.
Dozens of schools have been shut and roads closed as the South Island braces itself for the storm, which is due to make landfall on Tuesday.
New Zealand's national airline has cancelled all flights in and out of the capital, Wellington, on North Island.
Residents were told to expect floods and winds of up to 150km/h (90mph).
"The full impact of the storm will be felt overnight and tomorrow morning," said Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel.
She urged residents in low-lying areas to evacuate, saying: "We are expecting homes to be flooded."
The ex-cyclone, which has since been downgraded to a storm, last week left a trail of destruction in the Pacific island nations of Tonga and Fiji.
Tonga in particular is reeling from the storm which hit the overnight, injuring people anddestroying buildings including the parliament.

Going the extra mile
Bringing 2017 to a successful close, and commencing 2018 on a promising note, the Leo Club of Kolonnawa unveiled a series of projects that added milestones to its already rich 19-year history. The Club, which has so far organised and successfully held more than 2,500 charity projects throughout the country, has strived to adhere to its slogan A Family Like No Other literally and figuratively, as it has overseen programs targeting those who have been maligned by society: elders, street dogs, and cancer patients.
The 2017 season got off to a head start, with a massive lunch being given for patients at the Angoda Mental Hospital, bringing together 800 patients, in May. In September it unveiled an 8-minute video titled Vinivida 2 that explored the pernicious effects of cyber bullying. October saw two projects: the distribution of food packets among needy families in Kolonnawa (Ape Gama) and a campaign to feed street pouches for half a day (Operation HIFE), while November saw two more projects (We Are Not Alone, a poster campaign involving the Childrens Ward of the Cancer Hospital in Maharagama, and a Dhana campaign at the Kolonnawa Mathru Niwasa Clinic).
December saw a fitting end to the year with a legal aid campaign, held with the collaboration of the Students Law Association of Sri Lanka.
January 2018 saw the Leo Club Members from Kolonnawa target a neglected segment of the population: elderly people. For an entire day, the members congregated at the Veherakanda Wadihiti Niwasaya, to entertain and please the elders and to provide them with a wholesome, fulfilling lunch.
The Leo Club of Kolonnawa, with these campaigns, has endeavoured to prove again that theirs is a society which can reckon with the world. Celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, it has so far clinched several worthy accolades: having been recognised and applauded and awarded at both the International and Multiple District Level more than 306 times and having produced no fewer than five District Presidents for the Leo District 306C1.
Celebrating both uniqueness and differences, they have expended the effort they can muster to stick to their slogan, and that by affirming togetherness and hope.

The government has planned an archaeological exploration and excavation programme at the Wilpattu National Sanctuary. According to archaeologists, there are nearly 100 or more archaeological sites scattered across the sanctuary, extending to 133,000 hectares of jungle areas surrounded by the Anuradhapura, Mannar, and Puttlam districts.
Although Wilpattu was declared a wildlife-conservation region, it has not yet been declared as a archaeological-preservation site.
There will be a preliminary combined archaeological exploration and investigation programme covering ten major archaeological sites of high-importance such as Uppane Kuweni Palace and Kudiramale.
As an initiative, Archaeology Department, Wildlife Conservation Department, and Central Cultural Fund officials will be participating in the programme, if possible with foreign aid groups such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), a senior archaeological officer said.
A Wildlife Conservation Department official at Wilpattu said there were only 18 permanent wildlife officers and 23 volunteers on a Rs. 750 daily payment basis to look after the sanctuary.

Government urged to use mandate without permitting dictatorial rule
United University Lecturers Association (UULA) National Organizer and former Chancellor of the University of Peradeniya Prof. M. O. A. de Zoysa yesterday charged that the government is engaged in a power struggle by leaving aside the mandate given to it by the people.
This is a dangerous situation which may lead to anarchy. The end result would be a dictatorship represented by the Pohottuwa party. Those engaged in the power struggle may want to bring the Pohottuwa party to power and create a white van culture in the country, he alleged. Addressing the media yesterday in Colombo, Prof. Zoysa questioned the reason for asking the Prime Minister to resign from the post without any direct allegation against him.
According to the Local Government election results, only 66 percent of voters have refused the Premier and the President had been refused by more than 89 percent of voters. JVP Leader Anura Kumara had been rejected by more than 90 percent of voters. So, if the Premier should resign from the post considering this, JVP Leader Anura Kumara and the President should resign prior to him, Prof. Zoysa said.
He added that according to Article 46 of the Constitution, the President has no power to strip the Prime Minister of his position. Therefore, the only way to remove a Prime Minister is to successfully move a no-confidence motion against him. Thus, the President and his advisors should understand this situation, he said.
The National Government was formed following a formal agreement between the two parties and it does not relate to the Constitution of the country. Therefore, if SLFP members quit the national government, the UNP can form a government.
The Prime Minister should inform the Speaker that they will form a government and according to the Constitution, the Cabinet of a one party government should be limited to 30 members.
As a government with fewer thieves, the present government is the only government which can take action against those who committed crimes and are corrupt. However, even after three years, they failed to do that.

Hesson rejects call to scrap T20 internationals
WELLINGTON: absolutely its meaningful. Bayliss sparked the debate after his side failed to qualify for the trans-Tasman T20 series final, despite beating New Zealand by two runs in Hamilton on Sunday.
The Australian, who was appointed as Englands head coach in all forms of the game in 2015, questioned the wisdom of retaining the T20 format at the top level, citing the burden on top players and coaches.
Instead, he suggested administrators could ease international fixture congestion by leaving T20 to domestic competitions such as Indias IPL and the Australian Big Bash League.
I wouldnt play T20 internationals, Id just let the franchises play, Bayliss told Sky Sports.
If we continue putting on so many games therell be a certain amount of blowout, not just players but coaches as well. Bayliss, who has coached in both the IPL and BBL, said any international T20s should be held in a limited window based around the ICCs T20 World Cup.
If you want to play a World Cup every four years or whatever it is, maybe six months before you get the international teams and let them play some T20 internationals, he said.
England have struggled for form in the T20 tri-series, missing key players in the wake of the Ashes and one-day international series in Australia.
They edged past New Zealand with a two-run victory in Hamilton on Sunday but failed to qualify for Wednesdays final against Australia due to an inferior run rate.
The tourists still have a Test and one-day series to come in New Zealand and Bayliss said coaching all three formats on such a marathon tour was challenging.
He said it made sense to split coaching duties between different formats.
If you go to a swimming tournament youve got 1500m specialists and 100m specialists, he said. I think its definitely the way its heading, not just with the players. Bayliss announced last month that he would step down as England coach when his four-year contract ends next year. AFP

Indian Govt allotment of land to make way for cheaper healthcare
The Delhi government, citing shortage of healthcare institutions, announced it would allot land at cheap rates for public utilities and services. In Chennai, following this model could help make healthcare more affordable and accessible, say urban planners and healthcare analysts.
While big corporate names in the health sector are in expansion mode, several tertiary-care hospitals run by trusts that offer more affordable treatment have been stagnant.
"A medium-sized hospital will need at least an acre of land, besides the cost incurred in buying medical equipment. Only big names in the healthcare sector can afford this," said Dr Giridhar Gyani, director general of Association of Healthcare Providers of India. "This cost is often incorporated one way or the other in the hospital bills," he added.
Taking a cue from Delhi government, TN too can offer concessions for select hospitals, especially in areas where facilities are few, he said, adding that it is the states responsibility to map hospitals and form a network.
Public health experts say the state at present has given a free hand to private hospitals on where to set base or expand to. "It is completely unbridled," said public health specialist Rakhal Gaitonde.
"We see tertiary care hospitals coming up in congested neighbourhoods, and smaller clinics that are supposed to serve as referral centers are few and far between," he said.
While patients are forced to cough up higher costs with bigger hospital investments, residents who stay close to hospitals pay the price of poor planning.
"Many of these hospitals have valets who park their cars brazenly in no parking zones," said K Sampath, who stays close to Apollo Childrens hospital in Thousand Lights. "The only step the police have taken is to set up these boards. When we call to complain, our pleas fall on deaf ears," he said.

Iran resumes hunt for missing plane
IRAN: Iranian rescue teams resumed their search on Monday for a passenger plane that disappeared high in the Zagros mountains the previous day with 66 people onboard, local media reported.
State television said the weather had improved after blizzard conditions hampered search efforts Sunday, and that helicopters were now able to take part in the hunt for Aseman Airlines flight EP3704.
The authorities had called off the rescue effort overnight as heavy snow and rain made it impossible to work.
The ATR-72 twin-engine plane, in service for 25 years, left the capitals Mehrabad airport at around 8:00 am (0430 GMT) on Sunday and was heading towards the city of Yasuj, some 500 kilometres (300 miles) to the south.
It is thought to have crashed on the Dena mountain of Irans southwestern Zagros range, but one official said there could be as many as 100 peaks to search in the vast and remote area. The visibility in the defined search area is not very good and there is turbulence, so these safety concerns must be taken into account, Morteza Dehghan of the Civil Aviation Organisation told state television.
Despite all these conditions, both land and air teams are active. As soon as permission is given, drones will be used as well.
Around 100 mountaineer rescue workers were deployed on Monday, state television said.
Frances air safety agency BEA said it would take part in the investigation led by Britains Air Accidents Investigation Branch.
Three investigators and our technical advisers will go to the site, a BEA spokesman told AFP.

Iranian academic upbeat about stronger ties with SL
Dr. Mohsen Eslami is an Assistant Professor of International Relations at the Tarbiat Modares University in Tehran. He is visiting Sri Lanka from Iran to headline a conference organized by the Pathfinder Foundation.
Dr. Eslami sat down with the Daily News last week to discuss the Iran nuclear deal in the context of changing global politics and how it might open new pathways for trade with Sri Lanka.
Excerpts follow.
Q: Youve been invited to Colombo to give the keynote address at a conference on the Indian Ocean region in the 21st century. What is the focus of the research you will be presenting
A: Well, my field is international relations and foreign policy. Im a political researcher in international relations theory, but this is specifically about the Iran nuclear deal and regional conflict. The deal we have with the P5+1(shorthand for China, France, Russia, the UK, and the USA, as well as Germany) was so important. Because of the negotiation that came from the Western side and the Iran side, it made an unprecedented agreement between the two sides. This should be a model for other regional conflicts, as for example, Saudia Arabia and Iran, Syria, Bahrain and Yemen. This is the core of my research. Can we use this model for regional conflicts, or not
Q: Do you believe the framework has potential to be replicated elsewhere
Dr. Mohsen Eslami
Pictures by Rukmal Gamage
A: I believe that this nuclear deal is about the very old-fashioned dispute, the nuclear subject. Because of the limitation of this subject, its so different from other disputes that we have in the region. I counted some of the disputes we have in the region: like Arab versus non-Arab conflict, or the Arab-Israeli conflict, Shia-Sunni conflict and even Arab-Arab conflict. The sense of the conflict we had with the Western sides is about the subject of the nuclear arena and because of that, its different.
But, I believe one potential of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is opening dialogue, opening some kind of negotiation between two sides. This gives us what they call conditional infrastructure for other policy or other decision-making we may have, as for example between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
But I dont think the joint agreement will have direct effects, because its too different. It is about something specialized. But dialogue, negotiation and procedure is the new window for the players in the Middle East.
Q: Are you saying the deal could signal a new era of Iranian diplomacy, not just towards the West, but in the region as well
A: Yes, yes. We can observe a new approach of diplomacy on Irans part.
Q: Is Iran pursuing similar agreements with other regional actors currently
A: I believe that if we want to adopt or apply this model for other players, like Saudi Arabia or Turkey, we need an international player also - a mediator - because the essence and the nature of the conflicts that we have in this region is too different from the nuclear subject.
For example, you know that President Donald Trump just determined that (Jerusalem) is the centre of the Israeli regime. This is the very important and classic dispute that Arabs and Israelis, or Muslims and Israelis, have. Because of this decision, we see this dispute as ongoing and alive. We cannot resolve this dispute like the nuclear deal, because it is 60 or 70 years old. You have so many problems, wars, massacres. Because of that, if we want to use the model, we need a mediator like Russia or the USA.
But I dont think the USA under Donald Trump is going to come to an approach like this. Maybe after two or three years something can change.
Q: Did President Trumps decision really set back the peace process
"But America, under Trump, hasnt followed the right path, the right decision."
A: Yes. I think the decision of Donald Trump was a big risk. Because no other president did this. They understood that the Arab side, or Muslim-side, was also powerful. They have oil, they have integrity, they have potential for negotiating. The Muslim viewpoint is so important. Because of that, I think it was a very tough decision that Trump took.
I think it will show that this decision was harmful for Israel, because it demolished the peace process they had with the Arabs. All of the Muslim countries said they do not accept this. Because of that, this historical dispute comes alive again with the powerful wave against Israel. I think it was not a correct decision.
He acted on the will of the Israeli lobby. He didnt need to do this.
Q: President Trump has been critical of the nuclear deal, as have been many Congressional Republicans. From your side, do you worry about America walking away from the agreement
A: I think President Trump is going to get rid of the agreement. We believe, though, that Europe can do something, or manage the nuclear agreement. Obviously Trump has no will to continue.
European countries want to manage, use their lobby, to keep the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action going. We are waiting to see what happens. Iran is following our end of the commitment, we are obeying the commitment, but the American side doesnt want to do the same. One side cannot get rid of it because they dont want to commit anymore.
Q: There have been protests in Iran because it appears that people feel the sanction relief has not generated enough economic growth. Do you agree with that analysis
A: The US decision on sanctions is not correct. Because we are having problems with our banking procedures, it leads to economic, financial problems. But weve had sanctions from the first day of the Islamic Revolution victory, 40 years ago.
With these new sanctions, we accepted a deal with the Western side. But America, under President Trump, hasnt followed the right path, the right decision. Because of that, this deal is not going well. Banks wont work with us because of the orders of the United States.
But the protests we are having in Iran is an internal matter. Weve seen this in other countries too. We are committing to the agreement until the other side commits.
Q: People in the government of Sri Lanka and in the business world are eager to increase the countrys trade relationship with Iran. Are you meeting with any government or business leaders to discuss this
A: We have historically had a strong relationship with the Sri Lankan people and government. We can open a book about the history of Asia and see the connections between our regions in historical times.
But because of the problems that we have in Iran  the banks or the trade system  its not what it was. But we are interested in increasing trade and we know the opportunities in this country are huge. The Chinese have come, India has come, and Iran is also a partner for the Sri Lankan people.
When I landed in the airport last night, when they saw our passports, they had a good reaction, we had a warm welcome. It means Iran and this country have a cradle of kindness. We can find a worth here.
We have problems related to sanctions. But our ambassador in Sri Lanka is working hard towards this goal and so is the government of Sri Lanka, to be pioneers. Its the time for working, for trading and for cooperation.
We have to accelerate this.
Even now, as you know, more than 13 percent of Sri Lankan tea is exported to Iran. Also some Iranian products are imported to Sri Lanka, like oil, dates and nuts. Even with these sanctions, we have good relations with Sri Lanka.
"I think it (Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital) was not a correct decision."

It was not just the CoL
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes assertion that it was the cost of living which proved decisive in the outcome of the just concluded local government election is valid to a point, but it was not the only reason. Speaking to journalists at Temple Trees, on Friday, Premier Wickremesinghe said the reason for the UNPs loss at the elections was its inability to reduce the cost of living. The high prices of essentials such as coconuts and other frequently used commodities affected the final results, he stated.
True, the general talk in the market place was the soaring prices of essential commodities. A coconut fetching Rs.100 was astonishing indeed. So was the staple rice which ranged from Rs. 95 to 120 per kilo. People were frequently heard muttering curses after doing their purchasing. It was poor consolation to the public to be told that the severe drought and floods were the reasons for skyrocketing prices of rice and vegetables.
Urging the public to visit supermarkets to purchase commodities at cheaper prices too was laughable. The peasants living in far flung villages enduring hardships where they have to trek miles to collect drinking water in earthenware from dried up rivers and streams could not by any stretch of the imagination expected to go to plush supermarkets.
Yes, the cost of living played its part at the election, but not the decisive part. There were a multiplicity of factors that made the voters react the way they did. Matale district UNP MP Ranjith Aluvihare has stated that the biggest thing that had an impact in his area (and also other farming districts) was the fertilizer subsidy. That money did not go into the farmers accounts properly. On the other hand, we could not provide seeds on time. Sixty percent of the people in this country are farmers. As a result, the farmers used their vote against the government. He also said that problems such as school uniforms, the fact that students were deprived of the Mahapola Scholarships, issues regarding textbooks were not resolved properly.
There was also a general air of drift in the government. There was a tangible perception that it was not in control. Crises were allowed to happen, and, by the time solutions were found, the damage had already been done. A fine example is the week long fuel shortage in the country. Had proper precautions been taken the crisis could have been averted. The frustration of motorists and the public at large was clearly given vent to at this election where the crisis was brought afresh to the minds of the public by the Joint Opposition.
The frequent strikes and protests by students and the inconvenience and hardship this caused to the public due to traffic jams, and, the governments ineffective response, also went a long way in convincing the public that it was not in control. The all too frequent doctors strikes also took a heavy toll on the government which was seen as impotent.
The Yahapalanaya government also committed hara kiri by slashing the Samurdhi payment to a large number of recipients, inviting their collective wrath upon it. The huge majorities scored by the pohottuwa in the rural hinterland was indicative of this.
The Treasury bond issue, if ever it had an impact, was confined to cities and towns, where the more sophisticated were those likely to have discerned the subject. Though the UNP won the Colombo and Dehiwela Mt Lavinia Municipalities, it lost heavily in places like Moratuwa Maharagama, Homagama and Kaduwela which showed that the JO had effectively driven the topic into minds of the public in the metropolitan. Too little too late was done by way of damage control. The UNP was painted into a corner by not only JO, but also its alliance partner.
That it failed to prosecute any of the big time crooks of the former regime also had its fallout, with the public refusing to believe in the charges made against the Rajapaksas, prior to January 8.
Conflicts within the ruling alliance too had its impact. Certain policy decisions taken by the UNP were overruled, or, countermanded by the President, showing the Greens in poor light. Even budget decisions were overturned, betraying poor judgement on the part of the UNP Finance Minister.
Strident voices raised over the sale of national assets repeated ad nauseam was not countered effectively by the UNP speakers. So was the alleged invasion of Indian nationals to the country through the signing of the ETCA which was a constant refrain with the saffron brigade.
The UNP also failed to highlight the positive measures taken by the government to alleviate the hardships of the public. It did not speak at all on the drastic reduction of the prices of essential drugs, or, the benefits derived by the public as a result of sharp reduction in the fuel prices. The fact that the final installment of the Rs 10,000 salary increment to public servants was granted to them in January was not spoken of at all. Instead its speakers dwelt on topics that were Greek to the public, especially in the villages.

Jazz it up!
Dr. Gananath Dasanayaka was interested in the saxophone from a very young age. He is a product of S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia, but during his schooling years we did not realize that there was a saxophonist in our midst. Melodies features Dasanayaka whose dream is now a reality.
If you take Colombo, which is like the hub for English Music, within that hub also there is a very minute percentage of society who appreciate Jazz. However from the point of the industry lately we have seen younger people, taking up Jazz and appreciating it.
This is more than what they did 10 years ago. Then it was exclusively patronized by expats in Colombo. The monthly jazz event which happens in Colombo hosted by CR&FC used to draw a very expat crowd. Culturally also the Sri Lankan Colombo society has changed. Appreciation of this genre has become less, yet over the last few years I see a younger population getting into playing this kind of music. Ten years ago, a young jazz band was unheard of. But now you see young people in their 20s playing jazz music based on the modern styles.
I personally stick to old school jazz. Within the genre there is swing jazz which is called traditional old school and Latin Jazz with a lot of Brazilian and Cuban beats, explained Dasanayaka
The Saxophone had an allure to Dasanayaka and though he did not come from a musical family he fell in love with the Saxophone.
I started playing the saxophone when I was 16 but even I dont know why! I was just fascinated with the instrument from the time I was three or four years old. The first time I saw it was on TV. The sound of it and the look of it and the way it was played all really interested me.
I must say that I dont have much of a musical influence. My father is not a musician and neither is my mother and I dont aunts and uncles who were musicians.
Most musicians come from musical families, with me that is not so. I just took a liking to playing jazz and I pursued it. My father encouraged me. So I dont have a very strong musical influence in my life. However at our house there was music and that was a sort of influence, said Dasanayaka.
He started learning about music from the College Band Instructor Premasiri Gamhewa who taught him his ABC, and then met Gavin Senn who also played a role in Dasanayakas musical journey.
Playing a Saxophone is like a human voice, and you have a lot of control making it sound the way you want it to sound. The remarkable thing about is, if you take one instrument and three people blow it, you will get three different sounds. It is not an instrument dependent sound, it is a player dependent sound and I think the Saxophone has the most of that quality. Saxophone is more personal. You make it your sound, added Dasanayaka. Dasanayake wants to be a versatile and all rounded performer. In addition to being a talented Saxophonist he is also a talented singer.
See I am very passionate about singing. Both singing and saxophone went hand in hand in terms of passion. I just had this interest in music. If you take music, it is totally controlled by the singer. Being a musician and an entertainer are two different things. I want to strike a right balance there. I dont want to be a brilliant musician but who nobody wants to listen to. At the same time I dont want to be a brilliant entertainer without music skills. I want to bring the right balance and being a singer gives you that, pointed out Dasanayaka.
Even at school Dasanayaka shone academically. His family wanted him to devote his time to studies, yet his love for music was always there. That was one reason he won TNL Onstage.
I dont think my family ever envisioned me being a musician because that environment was not there at all. I suppose it came as a complete surprise. My family made it very clear that priority should be studies.
In a sense I may have foregone my opportunity to learn music and thankfully that did not happen! I am 36 right now and of course if you have the will you can still learn. So I have realized this dream of mine. Today I have made this a reality. I take this quite professionally. So this dream is still a journey for me.
I got the opportunity when I won TNL Onstage! That was the last thing on my mind. I did a few auditions and got my first contract in 2009. Since then I have been regularly playing at least once a week. Right now I have three contracts going, explained Dasanayaka.
He will be singing on February 25 at the Grand Ballroom Colombo Hilton at 7.30pm titled  The Great American Song Book. It is a public show. This particular show is based on big band jazz music.
My advice to anyone who wants to be successful in music is to follow your heart and be honest. Be dedicated. There are no short cuts. If you want to be good you have to practice and work hard. There is no substitute for that, said Dasanayaka.
Atelier is a recently completed City Hotel in Kandy with six, well furbished rooms, an Art Gallery and a Caf. Atelier portrays an abundance of art & architecture of Kandyan era and the Gallery will foster art & sculpture, mainly of artists of Kandy.
The maiden Exhibition of Paintings & Sculpture by well -known artists will also commence on March 10, and will be open from 10 am to 6 pm daily.

Joint proposal to be handed over to President
A set of proposals jointly signed by the Government Medical Officers' Association, SAITM Medical Students' Parents' Association and the Parents' Union of State Medical Students will be handed over to the President today at 10.30 am at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the document will be released to the media after handing it over to the President.
At the same time, an appointment will be requested from the President to explain the content of the document. Several other trade unions and organizations will join the three main organizations to hand over the document, he said.
This is a historic event where justice is demanded for the SAITM students by all three groups together. The basis of the joint agreement is that all SAITM students be given a state (KDU) or foreign MBBS recognized by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and not an MBBS SAITM which is internationally blacklisted and locally illegal, he added.

Just another woman..!
She was beautiful! She was Pakistani!
She strolled over to where I sat, on the banks of the St Lawrence, just before it rolled into the Great Niagara. May I sit here with you she asked. Sure, I said and made place for her on the wooden bench. We sat still and watched the giant river, and in the distance the mighty roar of the majestic falls. Are you going back to New York she asked. I nodded. May I travel along with you. I nodded again and then looked at her puzzled. You afraid of something I asked as gently as I could. She shuddered.
I am a college student, she said last week I crossed the Niagara to the Canadian side with friends. I forgot to carry my passport. I tried to return. Emigration refused. I had to stay behind in Canada alone, till my passport was sent across. It was frightening.
We watched the Falls together. A Pakistani and an Indian. To the people passing by there was no difference. Just another man and woman..!
The Greyhound bus from Buffalo left quite late. She sat next to me. We chatted through the night. She about her Pakistan, me about my India. She told me about Benazir, about college life in Pakistan, she talked about the role of the youth and about women in the country and then she listened as I told her about my beloved land to which I would be returning to in a weeks time.
And as the Greyhound purred along, she closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep. I dozed off too, and felt myself enter the land of nod.
It was slight nudge that woke me up. I opened my eyes and looked. Her head rested ever so gently on my shoulder. She was fast asleep. Tired, exhausted, three nights alone in a strange country, but now secure. I saw her vulnerability, I felt her helplessness and I tried not to move so that she could sleep. I stayed awake and she rested, oblivious that my tired shoulder was pillow to her undisturbed destiny with Morpheus.
A Pakistani and an Indian, to the rest, we were just another couple, a man and woman, tired after a pleasure trip.
We shook hands at the New York bus terminal at Port Authority, and she went her way and I went mine. I left for home and she called me a day before and wished me well. Thank you my friend, she said.
Today I read with sadness of the escalating tensions on both sides of the border. I thought of her. Was she also thinking the same thoughts Of a man and a woman on a Greyhound bus
The other travellers in that Greyhound bus, looked back and saw, just another man looking after a woman. Can we show them the same picture
Two nations, trusting each other
Leaning on each other for support.
Friends.
She was not enemy. She was just another woman, fragile, delicate and beautiful..!

Grandpass building collapse
Letter of demand for Rs. 10 bn over allegations
Dr. Ali Asger Shabbir Gulamhusein has sent a letter of demand to Farida Shabbir for Rs. 10 billion over allegations that the latter provided false evidence to the police and coroner on the Grandpass building collapse which occurred on February 16.
Dr. Gulamhusein, writing through his attorney Presidents Counsel Kalinga N. Indatissa, has stated that the claim made by Shabir that the building collapse was carefully planned by Dr. Gulamhusein in order to kill their uncle Taher Gulamhusein was false and malicious in intent.
He has strongly denied any connection to the building collapse and explained that Shabir made these statements with the ulterior motive to gain advantage with regard to pending litigation between him and Shabir.
Dr. Gulamhusein maintained that the collapse of the wall was an accident and he was not in the vicinity when it happened.
He further noted that the false accusation was also a result of the two parties being engaged in litigation over the estate of Shabir Abbas Gulamhusein. Farida Shabir had stated that the Last Will of Shabir Abbas Gulamhusein was forged and from the time of the institution of the aforesaid action, he alleged that Farida Shabir has made false affidavits and stated different versions at different times.
Her husband, Ali-Asger Tyebkhan too has lodged a false complaint against him, he stated and alleged that Farida Shabir and her husband have been party to the suppression of documents before the Courts of Justice.
The letter of demand also stated that in the past, they have put continuous pressure on Dr. Gulamhusein and his family to forego his legitimate rights under the Will.
The letter asks that Farida Shabir pay the Rs. 10 billion within a week or face legal action.

The Lords Test of 1984
Well begun is half done. Ironically speaking that was just the trouble with Sri Lanka in her first ever Test-against England at Colombo Oval in February, 1982. We began so well we were half way there at the end of the third day. A little more consolidation and the match would have been ready for the final execution and victory, stated my team mate at Ananda College in 1966, Sunil Wettimuny, in his book Cricket the noble art.
But there was no follow up of that good beginning. The second half was a batting shambles too ludicrous even to try to explain, a total and utter collapse mentally and morally. A glorious opportunity squandered in abject defeat, recalled Sunil.
If with the wisdom of hindsight one could have transported the Lords Test innings to that other Test match, what wonderful results might have been achieved! And Sunil added that, that was wishful thinking only to be indulged in day dreams, the stark reality was less kind.
Sunil unravelled that the Lords Test of 1984 whatever lied in store for Sri Lanka cricket, the first Test match in England will remain in the record books and will linger longer. Reams and reams were written and recorded in print and on film and what was not thus recorded the eye beheld.
It was a triumph of batsmanship and dedication, a vindication of the faith that was implicit in Sri Lankas ability in this respect, faith that had been sorely tried and tested and well nigh lost. If only that vindication had come two years earlier! -But there again he cried over spilt milk stated Sunil.
This was what the critics said then points out Sunil.
England humiliated by Sri Lankan amateurs screamed the banner headlines. Shambles-day of Lords shame, wrote Jim Laker.
Wettimuny and Mendis deepen England gloom said the Telegraph. Sids the crack shot. What a gem, reflected the Mirror. England on the rack again. Such and a host of other comments derogatory to English cricket appeared in all the national Press. It seemed an English sports writers past time to kick their national teams when they are down. (This is a common occurrence in Sri Lanka as well and in my book its all in order).
Sunil rewinds still further and stated that other commentators however, and writers who ought to know better, cynically suggested that the Sri Lankan straight bat strokes and a classic sideways stance were a sign of their naivete, their lack of sophistication and artless approach to Test cricket. A cynical comparison also to the days of yore when purer techniques prevailed. It was a left handed compliment.
The facts without comment have told their own tale, Sri Lanka without actually winning, had the better of that first Lords Test and earned the praise and respect of the cricket playing world. We had arrived on a grand note, not merely to participate but to share creditably in contest.
The long, dedicated innings of Wettimuny and the punishing strokeplay of Mendis had given rich colour to this match, wrote Tony Lewis.The tourist have brought to the game a pleasing instinct to attack with the bat: yet concentrate on technical excellence.
The style and high quality of their batting were a revelation to those not familiar with Sri Lanka cricket. Wettimunys innings lasted 636 minutes but it never lost its aesthetic appeal.
Mendis was brilliantly belligerent. The strongest memories of this Lords Test, historic to Sri Lanka, will be the cover driving of Wettimuny and Mendiss hooking of Botham, the ball crashing into the stands high and handsome. Not far behind were Ranatunga and Roy Dias: the one neat and confident; the other flowing into elegant strokes. The immense promise of Aravinda de Silva was a source of special joy and appreciation of the talent so abundantly displayed.
WETTIMUNY BROTHERS
Sunil had often wondered if ever there was in the history of cricket anywhere a case of three brothers with an identical record of having:
a) Opened batting for Sri Lanka.
b) Captained there club team (first class cricket) and opened batting.
c) Captained their school team and opened batting.
This was the happy record for his brothers Mithra and Sidath, and himself. It has been their privilege to captain Ananda College, their Alma Mater, and the Sinhalese Sports Club, and open batting for both institutions and also for Sri Lanka.
Brother Mithra had a superlative record in school and captained the Sri Lankans Schools team on their tour of India 1969/70.He was the only one to end up with a schools test hundred scored at Eden Gardens, Calcutta. Two Sri Lankan Test captains Warnapura and Mendis played under him in that series. He clinched his Test cap by scoring five centuries and seven fifties for SSC in the first class tournament and he toured New Zealand.
Brother Sidaths exploits are too well known for him to elaborate here concluded Sunil.

LVL Energy Fund Group musters Rs 447 mn PAT
LVL Energy Fund Group has recorded a profit after tax of Rs. 447 million for the 9-month period ended 31 December 2017 compared to Rs. 469 million for the corresponding period in the previous year, said LVL Energy Fund Limited Director and CEO D Sumith Arangala.
The decline in profit after tax was partly attributable to the increase in finance cost by Rs. 46 million to Rs. 155 million from Rs. 109 million in the previous year due to increased project related borrowings.
A significant drop in financial cost can be expected in the fourth quarter of the financial year compared to the third quarter due to the settlement of debt amounting to Rs 620 million out of IPO proceeds.
Income from subsidiary companies increased by Rs 98 million to Rs 311 million from Rs.213 million in the previous year whilst operating expenses increased to Rs103 million from Rs. 88 million in the previous year due to increase in operating expenses of subsidiary companies in line with their increased income.
Accordingly operating profit increased to Rs.217 million from Rs. 134 million in the previous year. Share of profit from equity accounted investees also increased to Rs. 412 million from Rs. 399 million in the previous year but profit before interest and tax for the period was lower at Rs. 628 million compared to Rs. 641 million in the previous year.
It shall be noted however that last years figure of Rs 641 million included a one-off item of Rs 108 million resulting from the reclassification of an available-for-sale financial asset from other comprehensive income to profit or loss.
Tax charge for the period was Rs 26 million compared to Rs 62 million in the previous year partly due to decline in withholding tax attributable to dividend income arising from timing differences in the declaration of dividend by companies under the Group.
Profit attributable to equity holders of the company for the period was Rs 395 million compared Rs 437 million in the previous year. However last years figure of Rs. 437 million included the entirety of the aforesaid one-off item of Rs 108 million.

A Transfer Application filed by former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage seeking an order transferring a case filed against him to any other court of competent jurisdiction other than the Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga, was yesterday fixed for March 2 by the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal two-judge-bench comprised Justice Kumuduni Wickremasinghe and Justice Janak de Silva.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Aluthgamage for allegedly purchasing a house worth Rs. 27 million at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7 over a complaint that he had allegedly purchased properties through illegally acquired money.
On a previous occasion, the case had been fixed for trial on February 20, 21 and 22 by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga is the Colombo High Court Judge who delivered the judgement regarding the controversial Sil Redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case.
Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita were sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the TRC.
In his petition, Aluthgamage stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of the Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC) which initiated an inquiry against members of the former regime and further said he would deny a fair trial. When the Transfer Application was taken up before Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Gunaratne, the matter was transferred to another bench to be on February 20.
Presidents Counsel Faizer Mustapha instructed by Sanath Wijewardena appeared for Mahindananda Aluthgamage.

Malfunction on ice
Pyeongchang, Monday: French figure skater Gabriella Papadakis suffered an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction on Monday, revealing a little more than just her Olympic gold medal ambitions in the ice dance competition.
A heavy title favourite along with partner Guillaume Cizeron, Papadakiss skimpy dress slipped during a raunchy short routine in Pyeongchang to leave little to the imagination of millions of television viewers around the world.
Despite the sartorial setback the French pair were in second place behind Canadas Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, who smashed the short dance world record.
The mishap happened when Papadakis leaned backwards early on and Cizeron inadvertantly managed to unclip the back of her racy green costume.
Her halter-top, complete with tassles and spangles, edged sideways to offer an unchoreographed flash of her left boob.
The pair were still able to finish as Papadakis tried in vain to keep her chest covered.

Methodist Church calls on people to stand for what is right
The Methodist Church Sri Lanka entreats all Christians and particularly the Methodist people in Sri Lanka to pray earnestly and stand firmly for what we as a Church believe is right before God. It is our understanding that our beloved motherland has been plunged into a grave situation due to political uncertainty.
As a Church, we believe that once again the people of our nation have spoken their mind loud and clear regarding the present governments failure to establish the yahapalanaya that everyone dreamt about since January 8, 2015.
We call upon those who were defeated at the recent local government election to honestly take stock of their political performance which led them to their defeat.
Over the past few months and especially during the recent election campaign, the two major political parties who had come together in forming the present government on the lines of a national government sent the wrong signals to the people.
The views expressed in the speeches made by the two leaders of the government and the other MPs clearly showed that they have lost their faith and confidence in themselves to run a national government.
When the two parties decided to contest the local government elections separately, the last nail in the coffin was fixed, wiping out the confidence that the majority of the people had to vote for a national government that was established on January 8, 2015. The local government election results sent shock waves to those in power, so that they will either awaken and keep the January 8, 2015 mandate given by the people or go into political wilderness.
We also call upon the victors of the local government elections to note that the mandate given on February 10 is not for them to resume the path of corruption, anarchy and all forms of violence with which they ruled this land before January 8, 2015.
Sadly, we have already begun to hear the breathing of threats and violence on the lines of ethnicity and religion by those who were backed and protected by the previous regime.
We, as a Church, call upon the leader of the party which won the greater number of seats in the local government elections to give an unconditional undertaking to all people of this land that he and those who have come into political power in local government institutions, will not do anything to reverse the process and the journey that the people of our motherland have begun in seeking a society where there is justice and equality for all sections of people and freedom to live with dignity, experiencing no discrimination based on ethnicity and religion.
The victory you have gained is not because the people have forgotten the corruption and violence carried out during your previous regime, but the sheer expression of disappointment and frustration that the people have with the present regime in its failure to usher the good governance that was promised to the people.
We assure all the political leaders of Sri Lanka of our fervent prayers, so that you could put aside all petty part politics, personal political agendas and remain committed to steer the country in the path of justice, equality and good governance which is the desperate and crying need of the people of Sri Lanka.

MR cannot subvert Constitution based on LG polls outcome - Sampanthan
The Constitution and laws of this country cannot be subverted by claiming benefits of the Local Government elections to his advantage in the way that Mahinda Rajapaksa pleases, Opposition Leader R.Sampanthan said in Parliament yesterday.
The Opposition Leader was speaking at the Special Adjournment Debate on the current political situation in the country. Refering to the political campaigning of the LG elections,
Sampanthan said he was quite alarmed that very early in the campaign, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in the course of an election rally said the election results would result in Tamil Eelam blooming.
The reason he gave was that the new Constitution being framed might result in that happening. Ever since the 13th Amendment was enacted in 1987-88, there had been continued efforts on the parts of various Presidents and Governments to include the 13th Amendment in such a manner to bring about a political resolution acceptable to all the citizens of this country,Sampanthan said. Even when former President Mahinda Rajapaksa assumed office, if he recalls his speech he made at the inaugural meeting, he spoke of maximum devolution of power and appointed Expert Committees that came up with reports, including the Tissa Vitharana Committee that came up with their own report which took the Constitutional proposals much beyond the 13th Amendment. Having agreed at that time, now he says Eelam is likely to bloom if the people are not careful at the Local Government elections, the Opoosition Leader said.
He said this misleading concept was planted in the minds of the innocent village people and they were told this is a referendum for Eelam.
This is what was told to the people in the south in order to gain their votes in his favour, which is very unfortunate, he said noting that the TNA in their manifesto talked of an undivided single country and no campaign in the North or East talked of any division of the country, but only spoke of a solution that is acceptable to the Tamil people, Sampanthan said.
Sampanthan said the people have delivered a verdict and in the name of democracy, the peoples verdict should be respected.
The Podujana Peramuna polled 44.69% of the votes cast at the elections. The UNP 32.61%, the UPFA 8.90% and the SLFP polled 4.48%. If one was to add the votes of the UNP, the UPFA and the SLFP it adds up to 45.99%. The JVP polled 4.32% and the ITAK polled 4.07%. If those two partys polls were to be added too the combined votes of all these parties would add to 55.31%.
The vote the former President polled at the Presidential election in 2015 is more than what he has polled now, Sampanthan said.
There have been three elections in recent times, but in none of these elections has the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa been able to obtain over 50%. Therefore, there is nothing to get excited about, adding that the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna had received just 44.69% in favour of Rajapaksa as opposed to 55.31% of polls against him, Sampanthan added.

In the name of the mother tongue
We are celebrating the International Mother Language Day, on February 21st. Our Mother Language creates and identity for us, giving us a sense of belonging, but at the same time it erects a barrier around us, keeping those who are using their own Mother Tongue away from us. The language identity alienates others living in the same geographically or politically identified region, where International Mother Language Day has to be celebrated separately by each group.
The only country on Mother Earth who has a right to celebrate a Mother Language Day is Bangladesh, because they won their independence through the struggle for their language. They can also take pride in the fact that almost all Bangladeshi people speak Bangla, though they have nearly forty languages used by the people and thus they do not need a link language, because there are no language barriers.
Mother Language has two interpretations, the language spoken by the mother and the language of the Motherland, which is not the same at all times. Bangla is the language of the Motherland to the people who live in Bangladesh, while it is the language spoken by the mother and her ancestors for the people who live in West Bengal, separated from their brethren by a political barrier. They have to identify themselves as Indians. For the Bangla speaking Indian to cross the border, to visit his cousins speaking the same mother tongue, he needs a visa, and so does the Bangladeshi needs a visa to enter West Bengal.
Language identity becomes confusing in the Global Village today. When a Sinhala family migrates to England, some children of the second or third generation would start speaking in English, if their Sinhala mother speaks to them in English. At school they learn in English. Then his mother tongue becomes English, though he would try to identify himself as a Sinhala, and he does not become an Englishman. It would be the same for a Bangla speaking family too. But the choice was theirs, unlike what happened in the country named by the British as East Pakistan, when the West Pakistan rulers tried to force the Bangla speaking Bengalis to adopt Urdu as their official language. And that decision triggered the struggle for the right to use their mother tongue, leading to the independence struggle. That is why the Mother Language is of such high significance to the people in Bangladesh.
Borders were created and barriers erected by man against man, and man only. The early man did not have a problem of crossing the only borders they came across, the rivers, oceans, mountains and deserts, or even language. It is history that created all barriers. Apparently Buddha had not faced a language barrier, nor had the traders travelling to distant lands, the Chinese pilgrims to South Asia, and the monks who travelled with the traders.
Academic career
History of mankind had always been distorted. It was always recorded by those who were in power at the time of the happenings, or those who took over power later. In the past historians always wrote to please their masters. Today too, some of them write to please their masters, some to advance their academic career, and others to make quick money by writing history for the entertainment business, like in films and television serials. History uses language to create divisions, conflicts and cause violence.
Oral and later written legends, epics and history had always contributed to the erection of barriers of nation, race, creed and language. Every conflict, every incident of aggression or violence was recorded and perpetuated to keep the fires of enmity and vengeance burning, while literature very often added more oil to the fire. Poetry and song were used to whip up hatred, incite vengeance leading to unimaginable violence. Language was the medium for all these evil actions. A very good example is the partition of India and Pakistan seventy years ago. It is true that many children women and men suffered and died during the partition violence. It is the Mother Languages of those who suffered, Panjabi, Urdu and Hindi, which keep the memories alive feeding the fires of hatred.
The barrier of language was also a curse left with us by the British. In pre-historic South Asia language had never been a barrier. The unification of regions or countries had almost always been forced upon people, by greedy power hungry rulers, except perhaps in the United States. However when it comes to partitions, sometimes it is initiated by power hungry others, who wanted to become a king or ruler of his own kingdom, rather than under another. Then he would incite a group to which he gives a separate identity and getting the people to struggle for a separate rule. At other times the struggle for separation arises spontaneously, by an oppressed minority, when a link language breaks down, as it happened in Sri Lanka, where language identity developed into a thirty year armed conflict. In East Bengal it was a spontaneous struggle by the majority against a despotic minority rule and they were successful in creating their own country, Bangladesh.
Where a nation consists of people using different mother languages we need to develop trust among all our people, reconciliation comes inevitably. Poetry and all forms of literature could bring the trust among us, because poetic language is common to all of us, whether we write in Bengali, or Hindi or Urdu or Divehi, or Sinhala, we share the same thoughts and feelings. We also have so many words in common, that it is not so very difficult to understand the other tongue to some extent, we have the opportunity to translate from one language to another.
Language is one barrier we could overcome. We have to occupy Babel and work towards a universal language, or at least bring down the six thousand odd languages to at least six. Once we occupy Babel, we should be able to share all the knowledge on earth, and all the literature on earth, with everyone, everywhere, without any barriers of language between us. We have people using the same mother tongue, but separated by borders, like our Bangla writers and poets from Bangladesh and West Bengal, like Urdu speaking writers and poets from India and Pakistan.
We have the language barrier, but which has not been hindered by the political and geographical barriers. The South Asian Tower of Babel is not as complicated as the global Babel. We have managed to communicate with each other to some extent, within our Babel, for several thousand years, because most of our languages have grown from same origins and we share so much in common. We have so many of the South Asian nations communicating across borders in the same language, or which could be understood by many.
We do not have to develop a common language, though at present we use English as our link, and as our Lingua Anglia. And we can continue to do so, because there is a revival of the English language in our schools and universities, and we should be able to manage with it till such time as we could develop translations by our computers. Once we have instant translations of our South Asians languages into English, which could be accepted as a neutral language, our language barrier would disappear completely. By then also we could all meet in cyberspace, and we need not worry about all the geographical and political borders.
Universal language
Since we also believe that we are the only animals on earth who can use speech, who can use language for communication, we should be able to use such communication skills to develop better relations with all human beings on earth. If man is so intelligent, ingenious and can reach out to the stars, we have to ask ourselves why is it that we have failed to develop a universal language. We should be able to use our tongue, instead of our hands, to settle any dispute that may arise among us, and to reach out to all the seven billion people on Mother Earth.
The English language used by nearly 400 million people has over 600,000 non-technical words. Yet most Americans use only around 800 to 1,000 words in everyday conversation. A typical American college graduate knows only 20,000 - 30,000 by the time he or she graduates, which is less than 2 percent of all English words.
This data makes it encouraging for all the people around the world, engaged in developing a common language or a translation system, to reverse the curse placed on mankind when erecting the Tower of Babel.
Once we occupy Babel, we should be able to share all the knowledge on earth, and all the literature on earth, with everyone, everywhere, without any barriers of language between us. On occupation, we should also be able to control and contain all the unwanted noise which leads to confusion in communication.
Man can be truly Independent only when he has Independence in communicating with all mankind. We would have enjoyed this independence millions of years ago, when our ancestors first developed the capability of speech as a means of communication.
We lost this capability sometime along the ladder of evolution, as man started spreading out from Central Africa to every corner of the world. Perhaps it was a cruel joke played upon man by nature, or an experiment which went wrong, as Homo sapiens was trapped in a Tower of Babel where they could not understand each other. It happened only to man, because all other animals appear to be communicating in a common voice among their kind. A dog anywhere on earth barks in the same way, and so does a lark when it sings.
Man has always been a chauvinist. When each tribe, clan or ethnic group developed a different language for their own use, and identified themselves by the language, they began to talk of a Mother Tongue. When one such group became a majority in a geographical region and considered the region belonged to them, then all other smaller groups using other languages became minorities and that is when everybody lost their independence of communication, both the majority and the minorities. Everybody who did not use our own language become strangers, outsiders, foreigners to us. A native of one country became a foreigner the moment he stepped into a country where his own language was not understood. When people of different language groups gathered in one place, they remained as far apart as when they had been geographically.
For man to achieve true independence in communication, he has to develop a Universal Language, a language common to all human beings, all over the world. It is not just a distant dream, but a vision we could make a reality in the near future, by making use of all the electronic technology now available. It could be a computer generated language, to be read and understood by people all over the world, making instant communication with everyone, by phone, by text messages, by electronic mail, or video. The first step could be the simultaneous translation of such communications.
This universal language would not need a written script, the computers can use their own language independent systems, because by this time man would be in his tertiary orality, where he would not, and need not be able to read and write.
As the old saying goes, necessity is the mother of invention, even today. The necessity is here, because of the easy and spontaneous global communication systems available, but with the frustrating handicap of all the different languages in use globally, in our Global Village.
There is also a fallacy backed by a few misguided or politically opportunistic people that a person can be proficient only in his mother tongue. They carry this argument further by saying people should do their creative writing in their mother tongue only, that a successful poem can be written only in ones mother tongue. But this has been disproved in our country, Sri Lanka, first by Ven. S. Mahinda Himi, who was born in Sikkim, Who probably used Tibetan as his mother tongue, but became more proficient in Sinhala than most Sinhalese of his era.
Politically opportunistic people
Another is Anne Ranasinghe, whose mother tongue would have been German or Hebrew, but who won the Sahitya Rathana Award for her poetry written in English. In India R. K. Narayan did not write in his mother tongue. Gurudev Rabindranath could perhaps be the best example from our region, as he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his own translation of Gitanjali into English.
True independence could be achieved only when we become language independent, like already we have language independent computer applications, and cross-platform and multi-platform software. Scientists are discovering that among humans, numerical reasoning and language are functionally and neuroanatomically independent, that grammatical and mathematical syntax are independent. This brings us closer to a language independent communication system.
Looking forward to the day when our children would be able to live in a post-Babelian world, and be truly free and truly independent.
Steven Pinker, who wrote the best-seller, The Language Instinct (1994), had said that through language we are enabled to rise authentically to a level of becoming fully human, because information is a particularly good commodity of exchange that makes it worth peoples while to hang out together. The problem is, the exchange has to be with different currencies, of different values, making it more and more difficult to hang out together.
However we can still hang out together. Even inside the tower of Babel we can understand each other, because we have found ways to communicate through the barriers. As U.R. Ananthmurthy had written in the SAARC journal Beyond Borders, Plurality of languages, cultures and religions has not in the past threatened the unity of our country. ...the literature in our bhashas, with their history as well as their potential, has contributed to our sense of a Nation with a difference. This statement could apply not only to India, but to all SAARC countries, and we should consider all of us as One Nation. The physical and geographical barriers cannot keep writers and poets apart and the modern day transport and communication facilities have helped immensely in this regard. It is only the human barriers we have to breakdown now.
On this day, as Bangladesh really celebrate their well earned independence, as a first step, let us create a platform between Bangla and Sinhala, because we have so much in common between our cultures. Let us translate the great modern Bangla writers into Sinhala and Tamil. Let us introduce great Sri Lankan writers, both Sinhala and Tamil, to the Bangladesh readers.
Ronald Reagan, on June 12, 1987, said in Berlin, Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall. Let us appeal to all mankind, tear down these walls, all the language barriers we have built between us. This is an opportunity for writers of the world to unite, and united we could change the world to be a better place, not only for humanity, but for all life forms.
Let us learn from Gurudev, the greatest Bangla writer, let us sing together and walk together to a better, more humane world.

North to get 125 model villages
The National Housing Development Authority will build 125 new model villages in the Northern Province this year for the benefit of families displaced by war, Chairman of the Authority Lakvijaya Sagara Palansuriya said.
The model villages will be located in Mannar, Vavuniya, Killinochchi and Mullaitivu districts, he added. Last year, 48 model villages were built in these areas for the war displaced.
The construction work would be undertaken with the labour contribution of beneficiary families themselves. The political leadership in the Northern Province was also supporting this programme without any political bias and this was a great victory achieved on the part of Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa, he said.
Similar housing programmes were being implemented in the Ampara, Batticaloa and Trincomalee district in the Eastern Province too for the benefit of affected families, Palansuriya said. Work on the model villages programme in the North had been already launched since the Minister had directed that construction work be completed by October this year.

This film is about two men in uniform serving their country but belonging to two different generations and how their point of view clashes. The movie stars Sidharth Malhotra, Manoj Bajpayee, and Rakul Preet Singh. It is not a war film. Its an espionage thriller predominantly. It talks about different issues of the country.

Darkest Hour
Old mans success vehicle
Never, never, never give up  Winston Churchill
Popular Hollywood actor Gary Oldman gives a surreal portrayal of the late Prime Minister, Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour. Director Joe Wright narrates the essences of determination and delivers a pretty interesting story altogether in the film which is a strong contender for this years Oscars.
It is not just only Oldman playing a historical role that we are all aware of but the actor literary disappears into the role of Winston Churchill. Oldman voices his character magnificently. For that role, the actor had to undergo hours of make up to pull off his transformation into the former Prime Minister. Oldman brings the man to life embodying habits like constant cigar smoking, habitual drinking, and unique way of speaking. Darkest Hour is clearly Oldmans vehicle and he uses the film as a means to give what may be his best performance to date. He brings equal parts of warmth and gravitas to a historical figure known for being intimidating.
Oldmans Drama
In one particularly memorable scene, Oldman also offers a great deal of vulnerability to Churchill. This brings the whole character together.
As predictable as the Golden Globes, it is (at most times) with the Academy, receiving six nominations including best actor. Oldman won at the 75th Golden Globes for his performance and might probably sweep off the boards for the same at the Oscars.
His performance made me want to learn more about Churchill because though knowing he had done great things I am not sure to what extent he had gone through to become the Prime Minister and how much support he had in his path to victory.
The supporting cast makes a good portrayal of those real people who had displayed a negative as well as a incentive approach towards Churchills perspective place as Prime Minister. They play necessary adversaries to Churchill displaying depth in their own conflicting ideas on how to lead Great Britain through the war and its outcome.
His interactions with Mendelsohn as King George VI are rife with tense politeness that translates into a truly compelling drama. Thomas, as Churchills wife Clementine, also works to bring out the Prime Ministers heart and humor, though her character isnt given much else to do beyond showcasing those qualities in her husband.
The most enjoyable foil for Oldmans Churchill is Lilly James portrayal of his secretary Elizabeth Layton.
Like Clementine, Elizabeths main role in the story of Darkest Hour is to highlight Churchills heart, humor and vulnerability  essentially, the human side of the popular historical figure. However, Elizabeth is given a bit more development, and James performance brings the young secretary to life with charisma and charm.
The elevator pitch is how Winston Churchill went from being a contempt outsider to saving all of Great Britain. Britain wanted a peace deal with Hitler at the time and if they did, the world would have definitely seen a different picture now. It was one man, Churchill, who said, No, We shall fight them on the beaches. Churchills famous radio speech went down in history and it changed the course of the European society on either side of the English Channel.
The second plot
Coincidentally, the second plot to Darkest Hour is disclosed in the movie Dunkirk by Christopher Nolan. The Darkest Hour plot is not about Dunkirk story or about principally the planning of the Dunkirk evacuation. It is about whether or not Great Britain should do a peace deal. Dunkirk is a small element in this movie, and so the big point of difference is that as a comparison. The audience, in a way can get details from Darkest Hour that they dont get from Dunkirk and vice versa. Ironically, both films will be competing against each other for the awards this season.

From crisis to sustenance  Part 16:
One of the greatest myths about leadership is that some people have it and some dont
During the past 15 instalments, we have carefully analysed the aspects of Blue Ocean Strategy. When you want to come out of a crisis, the first priority is to understand the strategic angle. There is no doubt, the Blue Ocean Strategy would help you to develop a new path to move upwards. From today onwards for seven weeks, we will be talking about Leadership development because it is the second important point you need to consider.
What is leadership
Leadership is not about position or title, power or authority. It's about relationships, personal credibility, and what you do. It's about an observable set of skills and abilities that are useful wherever you are. The leadership skills can be strengthened, honed, and enhanced, given the motivation and desire, along with practice and feedback, role models, and coaching.
The first place to look for leadership is within oneself. The executives must take that look into themselves to find out the skills they now have and to build more into their potential to make a real difference. Focusing on the practices that actual leaders employ, this brief course of study will offer young leaders the opportunity to measure their current leadership strengths and weaknesses, to make a plan for improvement, and to commit to growing as true leaders.
One of the greatest myths about leadership is that some people have it and some dont. A corollary myth is that if you dont have it, then you cant learn it. Neither could be further from the truth.
We all have leadership qualities ingrained. All we need is polishing them up and bringing them to the forefront. It is an ongoing process to develop ourselves as a leader.
What do we mean by the challenges of leadership
Being a leader is in itself a challenge. The challenges of leadership are really of three kinds: external, coming from people and situations; internal, stemming from within the leader himself; and those arising from the nature of the leadership role.
External challenges
It's almost impossible to imagine a situation where a leader doesn't have to cope with external challenges. In an organization, such issues as lack of funding and other resources, opposition from forces in the community, and interpersonal problems within the organization often rear their heads. Social, economic, and political forces in the larger world can affect the organization as well.
To some extent, the measure of any leader is how well he can deal with the constant succession of crises and minor annoyances that threaten the mission of his group. If he is able to solve problems, take advantage of opportunities, and resolve conflict with an air of calm and a minimum of fuss, most of the external issues are hardly noticeable to anyone else.
If the leader doesn't handle external challenges well, the organization probably won't, either. We've all seen examples of this, in organizations where everyone, from the Managing Director to the junior executive, has a constantly worried look, and news is passed in whispers. When people feel that leaders are stressed or unsure, they themselves become stressed or unsure as well, and the emphasis of the group moves from its mission to the current worrisome situation. The work of the group suffers.
Internal challenges
While leadership presents to each of us the opportunity to demonstrate the best of what we are, it also exposes our limitations. In many cases, good leaders have to overcome those limitations in order to transmit and follow their vision. Fear, lack of confidence, insecurity, impatience, intolerance (all can act as barriers to leadership. At the same time, acknowledging and overcoming them can turn a mediocre leader into a great one.
It's often very difficult for people, especially those who see themselves as leaders, to admit that they might have personality traits or personal characteristics that interfere with their ability to reach their goals. Part of good leadership is learning to accept the reality of those traits, and working to change them so they don't get in the way
Challenges arising from leadership itself
Real leadership makes great demands on people. As a leader, you are responsible for your group's vision and mission, for upholding a standard, often for being the group's representative to the rest of the world and its protector as well. These responsibilities might be shared, but in most organizations, one person takes the largest part of the burden.
In addition to its responsibilities, leadership brings such challenges as motivating people - often without seeming to do so - and keeping them from stagnating when they're doing well. Leaders also have to motivate themselves, and not just to seem, but actually to be, enthusiastic about what they're doing. In other words, they have to be leaders all the time.
The most important personal quality people look for and admire in a leader is personal credibility. Credibility is the foundation of leadership. If people dont believe in the messenger, they wont believe the message. Titles may be granted but leadership is earned.
Eight Practices of Exemplary Leadership
For leaders and leadership-aspirants, the following eight practices of exemplary leadership model continues to prove its effectiveness as a clear, evidence-based path to achieving the extraordinary. It turns the abstract concept of leadership into easy-to-grasp practices and behaviours that can be taught and learned by anyone willing to step up and accept the challenge to lead.
As measured and validated by the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI)one of the most widely used leadership assessment instruments in the worldongoing studies consistently confirm that these eight practices are positively related to both the effectiveness of leaders and the level of commitment, engagement, and satisfaction of those that follow.
Model the Way
Leaders establish principles concerning the way people (peers, colleagues, and customers) should be treated and the way goals should be pursued. They create standards of excellence and then set an example for others to follow. Because the prospect of complex change can overwhelm people and stifle action, they set interim goals so that people can achieve small wins as they work toward larger objectives. They unravel bureaucracy when it impedes action; they put up signposts when people are unsure of where to go or how to get there; and they create opportunities for victory.
Inspire a Shared Vision
Leaders passionately believe that they can make a difference. They envision the future, creating an ideal and unique image of what the organization can become. Through their magnetism and quiet persuasion, leaders enlist others in their dreams. They breathe life into their visions and get people to see exciting possibilities for the future.
Challenge the Process
Leaders search for opportunities to change the status quo. They look for innovative ways to improve the organization. In doing so, they experiment and take risks. And because leaders know that risk taking involves mistakes and failures, they accept the inevitable disappointments as learning opportunities.
Encourage others to Act
Leaders foster collaboration and build spirited teams. They actively involve others. Leaders understand that mutual respect is what sustains extraordinary efforts; they strive to create an atmosphere of trust and human dignity. They strengthen others, making each person feel capable and powerful.
Celebrate success
Accomplishing extraordinary things in organizations is hard work. To keep hope and determination alive, leaders recognize contributions that individuals make. In every winning team, the members need to share in the rewards of their efforts, so leaders celebrate accomplishments. They make people feel like heroes.
Innovate constantly
Innovation is a key factor in the success of any business. The demands in competitiveness faced by any company, whether in the present or in the future, are just huge. We are living in an unpredictable environment, and that requires quick reactions.
The good news is that we are also living in a scenario which is favorable to encouraging creativity, with an increasing accessibility and many tools to motivate innovation with. Leading requires giving great importance to innovation in any field and understanding that the real risk lies in not innovating. (Read more next week)
Leaders will effectively get everyone in the organization, from executives to employees, involved in developing an environment of innovation where creativity is rewarded.
Lead the change
The functions of planning, analysing and controlling, done by the leader over the rest of the group, have traditionally been given great importance. But precisely because of the ongoing change that we said we are facing, these responsibilities will become less and less indispensable, as the leader cannot effectively control such an unpredictable environment.
Therefore, the ability to adapt to change will become increasingly valuable and successful leadership will be supported by the ability of transformation. In addition to that, leaders will move with more frequency between different cultures and business models, so they will need to show flexibility and adaptability. The leader of the future is destined to be the driving force for change.
Develop soft skills
Social skills or soft skills will be regarded (as a matter of fact, they already are) as one of the most demanded types of skill. These skills are the ones needed to persuade, influence and convince others in order to achieve goals.
Leadership will categorically require these skills, and their mastering will result in a great asset for the company. The leader of the XXI century must stand as a social influencer on their environment. One of the top priorities of the company of the XXI century will be to understand and watch the communication process within and outside the organization itself.

Over $1.06 bn needed to fight back against hunger in 26 countries - FAO
With conflict and climate-related shocks sending global hunger numbers marching back up after declining for decades, FAO is asking for $1.06 billion to save lives and livelihoods and address acute hunger in 26 countries.
With donor support, FAO is hoping to reach 30+ million people who rely on agriculture for their livelihoods via a range of interventions that seek to rapidly restore local food production and enhance nutrition. These include, for example, providing seeds, tools and other materials for crop farming, safeguarding livestock through lifesaving veterinary care, organizing trainings in improved production, processing, and land and water management, and giving at-need families cash so they can immediately access food.
Escalating humanitarian needs are largely the result of the persistence, intensification and spread of violence and conflict  the impacts of which are often being amplified and aggravated by climate-related shocks.
"The reality is that while the lives of millions of people were saved thanks to rapid humanitarian response in 2017, millions more remain on the very edge of starvation. Maintaining food production and rebuilding agriculture are fundamental to preventing loss of life from severe hunger and to providing a pathway towards resilience in the midst of humanitarian crises," said Dominique Burgeon, Director of FAO's Emergency and Rehabilitation Division and Leader of FAO's Strategic Programme on Resilience.
"This is why FAO focuses on transforming vulnerability into resilience - so that when something bad happens families are better able to cope and feed themselves, people don't have to sell off their assets or flee, and communities can rebuild more quickly after the crisis passes," he added.
FAO's 2018 humanitarian appeal focuses on assisting crisis-hit, vulnerable people in 26 of the world's most food insecure countries.
These include Yemen, the country with the largest overall number of people in acute food insecurity, where the Organization aims to reach 5.7 million people. In the Democratic of the Congo, FAO plans to assist almost 2.8 million people. In South Sudan, 3.9 million people will benefit from emergency livelihoods support. In Syria, where three-quarters of rural families continue to produce their own food, FAO will provide 2.3 million people with the means to do so. And in Somalia, the Organization will assist 2.7 million people facing severe hunger.
The latest UN report on global hunger found that after years of steady declines, the ranks of the malnourished are once again on the rise and now totals a troubling 815 million people.
Continued conflict in Iraq, South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, and Yemen and other places as well as new outbreaks of violence in the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Myanmar have played a major role in driving hunger up.
In the Caribbean, hurricanes Irma and Maria left lives  and livelihoods  in tatters, while in the Horn of Africa ongoing drought has taken a heavy toll. Across all of Africa, the Fall Armyworm pest is threatening the crops of millions of farmers.

PARLIAMENT
Pledges given to people will be kept in next two years: Rajitha
The undertakings that led to the peoples mandate on January 8, 2015 will be kept without failure in the next two years, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne stressed in Parliament yesterday.
Speaking at the adjournment debate on the current political situation in the country, the minister said nobody would be allowed to reverse the trajectory they set on January 8. We even risked our own lives to bring about this change. We will correct our own mistakes and march forward. We have two more years to show progress and deliver our promises. It was a foolish logic to claim that the National Government should resign when it lost a village level election. Where in the world that happens Only Sri Lankan Parliament has such idiots who bring up such foolish arguments, he commented.
People in this LG polls taught us a good lesson, but they have not defeated our force, the minister said analysing that the forces against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa received 55.35 percent of the total votes whereas the SLPP received only 44.65 percent at the recently concluded LG elections. The Minister further said that when the SLPP won 3,369 electoral wards, the UNP and the SLFP had won 3,417 electoral wards. He added the percentage of votes obtained by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had gradually dropped from 57.88 percent in 2010 to 47.58 percent in 2015 and to 44.65 percent in 2018.
Now is the time your court cases will gather speed. Be prepared to be in jail in the days to come, Minister Senaratne told the JO urging the Government to speed up the cases against large scale corruption and criminal charges without letting anybody off the hook in the name of personal contacts.
In the course of Senaratnes speech, he also tangled with NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa over the educational qualifications and corruption allegations of the latter. You even failed the Ordinary Level Exam. Show your O/L certificate if you can, he told Weerawansa. Weerawansa retorted that he would immediately resign from his Parliamentary seat if the minister could prove his claim. Senaratne also accused Weerawansa of spending public funds for the wedding ceremony of the latters niece. He said the JO members attempt to topple the Government was to escape from legal actions against the offences they committed. Weerawansa again challenged the Minister to prove the allegation stating that he would resign if those were proved.
UPFA will be in Government till President gets SC opinion: Thilanga
The UPFA will continue to be in the National Government till the President receives Supreme Courts opinion, Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala told Parliament yesterday.
He made this statement taking part in the special adjournment debate on the political situation in the country. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had requested Sumathipala to explain to the House over the newspaper reports quoting him (Sumathipala) which stated UPFA decided to quit the National Government.
Sumathipala, who was the only member present in the House representing the UPFA members in the Government, said they decided to remain with President Maithripala Sirisena as one group to maintain political stability in the country. The decision has been arrived at the UPFA group meeting chaired by the President at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday noon.
UPFA members in the Government requested the permission of the President to leave the Unity Government taking into account the political viewpoint of the party. The President was of the view that such a change might affect stability of the country and the Government. Therefore, he sought legal advice of the Attorney General. The AG, however, had told the President that it was more appropriate to consult Supreme Courts opinion at this stage to interpret the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. That was the situation prevailed at Sunday night and I take the responsibility of my statement to the media after that meeting. But when we met the President today, he requested us to remain in the Government till the Supreme Court delivers its opinion to maintain stability of the country, Sumathipala explained. Sumathipala concluded his statement acknowledging the Speakers efforts over the past week to maintain stability in the country and in the Parliamentary affairs.
RTI Act revolutionised transparency in Government: Sumanthiran
Good legislative measures are taken mostly when there is weakness and uncertainty of government. The progressive legislative measures are possible when the government is weak, TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran said in Parliament yesterday.
Sumanthiran was taking part in the debate on the Code of Conduct for MPs and revised set of Standing Orders of Parliament yesterday.
Commending the eighth parliament for succeeding in presenting the set of standing orders and the code of conduct for the Members of Parliament, he cited the 17th amendment as one such example. He said the supreme example is the 19th amendment to the Constitution. As we consider the new Standing Orders and the Code of Conduct for the members of parliament, it seems ironic that we are discussing these two documents which are important for the conduct of business in Parliament, on a day when there seems to be so much uncertainty in the country with regard to the Prime Minister, Cabinet and the Government, he said.
For the orderly conduct of business of the House when MP Dinesh Gunawardena rose on a point of order last morning, consequent to a letter given to the Speaker, the Parliament Business Committee in a very orderly manner, made the decision to debate that issue for three hours from 4 pm to 7 pm yesterday. That is testimony that even in such a situation where there is so much uncertainty, that business of Parliament is conducted in an orderly manner according to the prevailing standing orders. Hence this is an opportune moment to debate this document that has been prepared with lot of care, as said by Ajith P. Perera when he introduced this document, he said.
Sumanthiran noted that when it was a minority government, numbers of that government was so low, yet it was possible to enact the 19th amendment with just one member voting against it. When a government is weak, it seems that consensus is possible. That is why I say it maybe an opportune day to adopt these new standing orders that have been presented to the house. On a day when this country and even this Parliament seems unsure as to what governance will look like tomorrow in this country, these Standing Orders have been prepared by this committee across party divides and brought in a number of progressive measures, he said. He added that it was necessary to have a new set of Standing Orders because the previous one is now so old and most of the provisions had become obsolete and dysfunctional.
The Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament, he said, was a promise given by the unity government, an electoral pledge by the new dispensation that was brought in from January 2015 to August 2015 and it may be important today to look back on that 3-year period. Even pat ourselves on the back for the number of progressive legislative measures that this parliament was able to enact. After the 19th amendment, the RTI Act was brought into operation and it has revolutionised transparency in governance. Today it may seem that what was achieved during the past three years may come to an end or is a failure. But much of legislative measures that were adopted was progressive. The democratic reforms must be acknowledged and an important reform was the strengthening of Parliament and it is to that end that the new sectoral oversight committees have been brought in. This whole concept of a sectoral oversight committee seems even today alien to us is an important measure in strengthening Parliament, Sumanthiran said.
Although many members and ministers seem dissatisfied, the committee system that prevailed before this which were consultative committees is what they want. He urged the house to look at this differently as it is a very different issue to the setting up of sectoral oversight committees.
SLPP proved themselves by winning LG polls: Dinesh
Joint Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawardena said the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna had accepted the challenge thrown at them and proved themselves by winning the Local Government elections.
He said the alliance in the unity government is broken and they cannot function and provide solutions to the issues facing the country and urged the unity government to resign honourably.
He was taking part in the special adjournment debate on the current political situation in the country in Parliament yesterday.
He said the debate on the current unstable situation due to the political crisis the country has been thrust into is most opportune. After two and half years, the LG elections was held and the Joint Opposition and the Podu Jana Peramuna polled the best results at the election. The Podu Jana Peramuna won 3,369 seats, the UNP won 2,385, the UPFA won 674, the JVP 431 and the ITAK won 407 seats. The Podu Jana Peramuna is clearly the winner. This is the decision given by the people of the country,he said.
He said there is a political crisis and the country is in an unstable situation due to the actions of the government. The people have rejected this government but the government is clinging onto power disregarding the mandate given by the people. The stock market, business community and international community have lost faith in the government.
The people no longer believe the lies and myths spread by this government. But now the people have spoken and expressed their disappointment of the government and if they have any respect they should resign in a dignified manner as they have no power to govern this country, he said.
PM can continue as he has 2/3 majority in Parliament: Navin
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is in a position to continue the government as he can command the 2/3 majority in Parliament, Plantations Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
Speaking in Parliament yesterday joining the special adjournment debate on the current political situation in the country, the minister added that the flower bud (Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna) should prove it if they have the majority to form a government.
Dissanayake noted that in terms of Article 46 (2) of the 19th Amendment, the PM can only be removed if he resigns or if he ceases to be an MP.
Although there was a rumour being circulated claiming that a gazette was to be issued to dissolve Parliament on Sunday night, such a measure cannot be taken, he added.
He further asked the SLPP not to boast about having the majority, reminding them that they only have 44 percent.
Peoples mandate for the national government continues: Hakeem
A sense of instability has come about due to disagreement between the parties governing the country. However, the peoples mandate is for the national government to continue.
If they cannot continue, we should not have a unstable government, or run by remote control by another person or group. All parties who are going to form an administration must be prepared to take executive office.
If one party is not willing, by proxy or minority government, we are violating the very mandate we received, City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said.
He was taking part in the adjournment debate on the current political situation in the country in Parliament yesterday.
Hakeem said he was not in favour of the way in which certain bills were presented to the House in a manner that denies a citizen of his constitutional right to petition the Supreme Court against such a bill. What has happened is very surreptitiously amendments have been introduced which are totally different to the content of the bill that has been presented. He said Parliament should be more responsible in presentation of bills and should not merely rely on the certificate of the Attorney General to say the bill is consistent with the Constitution.
In drafting amendments to the Standing Orders, many ground-breaking changes have been incorporated and the concept of sectoral oversight committees which goes to empower the backbenchers of the House to have an oversight rule of the executive functions of the government. It is a very salutary feature. We must understand that certain functions of the high post committee as well as the other financial oversight committees such as the committee on public enterprises and committee on public accounts may also get overlapped by the provisions that have been included in the sectoral oversight committees. Even the accounts and financial matters concerning the enterprises coming under the different ministries could also be examined all over again by the sectoral oversight committees in addition to the committee on public enterprises and committee on public accounts.
So while these overlapping issues could be quite confusing, I feel the continuous oversight of the executive by the legislative arm is a very welcome feature and these are important changes that have been made.
I did not receive official intimation on UPFA quitting government: Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday told Parliament that he had not received any official intimation on UPFA quitting the National Government.
He made this response when the Joint Opposition MPs raised questions on newspaper reports of UPFA deciding to quit the National Government. The Speaker however said he would seek some clarification from the relevant parties on the media reports.
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena rising to a point of order said the number of Cabinet Ministers should be limited to 30 in the absence of a National Government as per the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. He pointed out the Cabinet of Ministers numbering to 50 is no longer valid.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella argued that the SLFP could not repudiate the MoU to form a National Government unilaterally.
JO MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said UPFA members in the Government ranks needs to confirm the House that they are still in the National Government. Nanayakkara also rejected the idea that one party in the MoU could not repudiate it without the agreement of the other party.
JO MP Bandula Gunawardena said it was a joke to continue the debate with a non-existing Government. NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa said President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan have no moral right to continue in their positions following the outcome of Local Government Elections. Sampanthan should hand over the Opposition Leader post to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, he added.
JO MP Dullas Allahapperuma said the total number of Cabinet Ministers, Deputy and State Ministers should come down to 70 from current number of 100 as the MoU between the SLFPand the UNP has expired after December 31, 2017. For seven days now, the country is embroiled in a political crisis. The final results of the LG bodies have been delayed. The rupee is depreciating and the stock market is falling down. We need to resolve these issues soon, he added.
UNP MP Nalin Bandara said the national level Government needs not to be changed following the results of LG elections. The national government is an affair between the UNP and the SLFP and if the two parties are willing to continue it, the JO has got nothing to do. The JO, which boasted on displaying the majority support of 113 MPs in Parliament, has been unable to collect at least 13 MPs in Parliament today, he commented.
The Speaker then proceeded to continue the debate on Code of Conduct for MPs and Standing Orders stating that the matters related to the current political situation could be discussed during the adjournment debate.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was present in the House at the time of the argument.
Speaker shows concern over situation in Maldives
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, in his capacity as the Chair of the Association of the SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians, wrote to Maldivian Speaker Abdulla Maseeh Mohamed yesterday regarding the evolving situation in the Maldives.
He pointed out democratic norms and parliamentary practices appear to be in peril in the Maldives at present.
Recent developments in the Maldives including the declaration of emergency and arrests, and disrespect of the Supreme Courts rulings, threaten constitutional principles, and undermine the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. The developments also impact negatively on credible and inclusive pre-election processes with the full participation of all political parties in the country. The Association considers the Maldives as an important member in its fold, and is therefore deeply concerned about the current and evolving situation in the country which impacts negatively on the region, the Speaker said in his letter. He urged the Maldivian Speaker to prevail upon the relevant authorities in the Maldives including all parties concerned to find peaceful solutions through dialogue that would ensure a functioning Parliament. He also urged him to reassure the people of the Maldives that elections will be free and fair and that fundamental, freedoms, democracy, security, stability and prosperity will be guaranteed.

Ranting French skier Faivre sent home from Olympics
Pyeongchang, Monday: French alpine skier Mathieu Faivre, the partner of American ski star Mikaela Shiffrin, has been expelled from the Winter Olympics over angry comments made after a race at the weekend.
The 26-year-old was sent packing from Pyeongchang by the zero-tolerance French team following remarks made to journalists after finishing seventh behind winner Marcel Hirscher in the mens giant slalom.
Mathieu will return to France for disciplinary reasons, David Chastan, director for French mens skiing, told AFP on Monday.
He made remarks after the race that were not in the spirit of the team and will not be retained for the team event.
Faivre was asked after the giant slalom about French skiers filling four of the top seven spots in Sundays race, led by bronze medallist Alexis Pinturault.
If you only knew what I think about the group collective, snapped Faivre, who bagged team gold at last years world championships in St Moritz. AFP

SAITM students are being used by a health sector trade unionist connected to NGOs for his personal gain, SAITM Medical Students' Parents' Association Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said.
We will reveal his identity soon, Wijeratne said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo yesterday evening, he said that this person took the pants off the government during the recent LG polls and SAITM parents will remove his pants soon.
SAITM is a BOI project and the government cannot take it over. Dr. Neville Fernando is the only owner of SAITM.
The people of Sri Lanka have clearly told the government that private medical education cannot exist in Sri Lanka. They did it by defeating the government during the recent LG polls, he said
The Secretary of the Parents Union of State Medical Students, Gamini Ekanayake said that all court cases existing against state medical students should be withdrawn by the government immediately because the students struggled for the country and to protect free medical education and not for themselves. They did not rob the Central Bank to be jailed.

Shania Twain movie star
Actress and singer Ashla Taylor is convinced she was destined to portray Shania Twain after one of the country stars concerts changed her life.
The newcomer will portray Shania in the upcoming TV movie The Price of Fame: Shania Twain, and admits she didnt hesitate when she was offered the role - even though it meant putting her own music career on hold.
It was so natural for me to fall into that character, Ashla tells Billboard. I have been studying Shania for a long time. She has been my personal and my musical influence in life.
Shanias 1998 show in Alabama was Taylors first concert and she admits that ever since that moment the Youre Still the One hitmaker has had a huge impact on her life.
When I was eight years old, my grandmother took me to see Shania - it was my first concert, she recalls. I saw her in her glory, and I remember thinking, even then, that was exactly the kind of woman I wanted to be. The light just turned on for me, and I began to study everything about her - her music, her writing, her voice.
The new TV movie, chronicles Shanias life from childhood in Canada to the release of her new album, Now, and everything in between. Music News

Short shrift for all sorts of long or baggy shorts!
Time was when short pants were considered outerwear only to be worn by juvenile schoolboys. Grown men did not wear shorts to avoid looking immature. As students in primary school we wore well-tailored shorts that were considered modish considering the harshly restrictive dress code. You see, we were not given a choice. But nonetheless it didnt mean we would have to look adolescent and sloppy like so many adult men forced to wear ballooning long shorts that made them look like blown up rubber effigies.
Back in the 70s and 80s, wanton abandon not only pervaded the catwalks, but also the length of athletic shorts. Take the then tennis circuit for instance with the likes of Jimmy Connors, Bjorn Borg, John McEnroe, Pat Cash and others who all donned short shorts with the exception of woman player Chris Evert who was togged out in fashionably designed mini- skirts.
Of course, athletic uniforms must be designed for performance, but like all clothing, they have also been affected by the styles of the times. And indeed, an analysis of World Cup soccer shorts over time shows that soccer kits reflected the rising and falling of womens hemlines. That is why any soccer coach will tell you why womens soccer teams in this neck of the woods are so rare. They claim that its quite hard to find enough women willing to wear the same outfit.
Soccer legends such as Pele and Diego Maradona mostly wore comfy short nether garments that allowed them free ball play, facilitating their mobility of breaking away from defenders and running loose with the speed and dexterity of forked lightning. They were maestros of the swivel and the dribble and could twist, turn and slither their way through the most formidable defenders as they found the net with astounding regularity.
And they were able to bob, weave and nip in and score because their shorts were functional and as daringly hem-lined as their deeds.
The fashion then was such that shorts gave athletes the cloth space in which to run without any impediments. But these werent just hemmed for business with inseams of up to two inches.
They were party-length, giving these virile showmen plenty of legroom to play to the crowd. At one time in history, everyone agreed that the shorter the shorts, the manlier the man. In the 60s and 70s, shorts of all kinds lived up to their name. For the ladies there were hot pants and Daisy Dukes and just all-around thigh exposing shortness. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on your persuasion, mens shorts could be every bit as revealing as the ladies.
These days, I dont think you could call what professional athletes wear as shorts. Anything that hovers at or falls below the knee is not a short, its what they call a shant, meaning a short pant that shant be a short, nor a pant. Now they appear to have taken this style over function thing too far. With all the new fabric technology, one would think these modern socceroos would seek out the most aerodynamic apparel available. Less, in this case, is more. All that extra fabric has become like an albatross around their legs and its not helping their game on or off the arenas.
In the sphere of off the field mens fashions cargo pocketed shorts are the single worst item a man can wear anywhere. Recently theres been a backlash against cargo shorts. Yes, I am willing to go that far. I feel that strongly about it. The first issue is this: A gentleman does not wear shorts that cover the knees. Some claim a gentleman never wears shorts at all. We wouldnt go that far, but if youre covering your knees, youre not bold enough to be a man in shorts in the first place. Always one for existential questions I have this to ask: Are they long short pants or short long pants What started out as a staple of military clothing became a trend that saw its peak in the late 1990s and early 2000s. People who wear them look like they smell bad too.
Mostly all cargo shorts are at least 11 inches long or longer which will cover the knees, creating a silly imbalanced look that pretty much ruins the whole point of wearing shorts to begin with.
The second issue is the actual disgusting cargo pockets that hang at the side of the too-long short leg. What the heck are you putting in those pockets Youre not a carpenter or a maintenance guy. You dont need space for a screwdriver, a spanner or a hammer. If you think you need those pockets, let me ask you this: Why is a four-pocket jean fine most of the time but a four-pocket short isnt Exactly! If youre still looking for places to keep extra items, theres always the possibility of carrying a bag with you. You know, like everyone else.
If the only issue was a few extra pockets, that would be one thing. But unfortunately, the extra pockets add considerable weight and bulk to these heavy fabric shorts, dragging them down even further from your hips.
As you must be aware by now Im no fan of the ultra-long baggy shorts of the past couple of decades. However, I will compromise for a happy medium. Mens shorts are best in moderation and there is a time and place for them. For instance somewhere between the current clown sized shorts and the thigh-high short-shorts of the seventies and better part of the eighties.
When will you males realise shorts arent really acceptable as serious clothing Basically they are suitable wear for the beach club. What I mean is, you cant wear shorts to work unless you are a tuk-tuk driver or road sweeper.
If you go to a nice restaurant, dont wear shorts. Maybe Ive just been conditioned to view normal pants as serious and shorts as way too casual. I dont know, they just dont feel very grown up apparel. But there is always a risk inherent with wearing shorts.
And whos to say youre not vulnerable If you wear shorts, then make darn sure you wear proper undies. Otherwise, one false move such as cocking up a leg may provide you with a whiff of fresh air. Worse still, unmentionable appendages may start spilling out in an unsightly mess that can scare the kids. But dont get too comfortable. Fashion is cyclical. What now is hidden may once again rear its ugly head.

SLCPI calls for more PPP for health sector
Sri Lanka has witnessed unprecedented growth and development over the recent past as evidenced by rising income levels which stood at US$ 3,759.20 by the end of 2017. While the economic impacts of this remarkable growth trajectory are clearly defined, increasing prosperity tends to be accompanied by changes in lifestyles and increasingly sophisticated demand for better quality products and services. Among the sectors most directly connected to these shifting trends in Sri Lankan society is the healthcare sector.
Elaborating on the ramifications of these changes, Shyam Sathasivam, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Chamber of Pharmaceutical Industries (SLCPI) called for greater partnership between public and private (PPP) sector stakeholders in order to preserve and enhance the countrys existing facilities while developing specialized capabilities to shift the goal of healthcare outcomes from treatment to prevention. Following are excerpts:
Q: How is Sri Lankas healthcare sector changing and what are some of the factors underlying these changes
A: Like all other basic services, the healthcare sector tends to be directly connected to GDP growth. Particularly when considered over the long-term, the Sri Lankan economy has witnessed tremendous growth over the recent past, as the country continues to move steadily with a GDP growth rate of four per cent, the expectations and aspirations of our citizens is also growing and changing. This trend certainly has important ramifications across all of facets of daily life. Today there are more people living sedentary lifestyles that when combined with increased disposable income and greater leisure options, tends to impact negatively on overall health and wellness, as evidenced by the tremendous rise in Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) over the recent past.
Conversely however, we also see that with rising prosperity, there is an increased willingness to invest in healthcare and greater interest in making healthier lifestyle choices. As a middle-income country, I think its safe to say that this will be a progressive trend and move forward, expect the tension between these two dynamics. Another important issue to consider is the growing demand for high quality tertiary healthcare services that are affordable and available to all those who want access to such care.
Overall, I would say that Sri Lanka has been quite fortunate to have successfully established a universal healthcare system that  for the most part  works quite well. However, with increased prosperity, the demand for specialized care is also an important factor and it is vital that we accommodate this demand, to ensure that the overall standards of healthcare in Sri Lanka are on par with international standards.
Q: How well equipped is the countrys current healthcare systems and policy towards dealing with these anticipated challenges
A: Overall, there is a lot about our system and the policies to be positive about and generally our system has provided positive healthcare outcomes for the majority of patients. A powerful advantage of our unified system is the ability of Government to draw upon substantial resources across the island to take action on a national scale. We have seen some highly successful, proactive examples in the recent past like the national Anti-Smoking campaign, and successful campaigns to eradicate Polio and Malaria.
However, we still face substantial challenges in terms of preventing, and combating disease while ensuring optimal healthcare delivery. Funding will always be insufficient to deal with the scale of challenges faced by the healthcare sector. Therefore it is vital to adopt a systematic approach to healthcare; and I think its fair to say that those systems are broadly in place. But there is always more that we can do, particularly in terms of improving access to treatment for all Sri Lankans.
Q: What are some of the most crucial components in ensuring optimal healthcare delivery for all Sri Lankans
A: One of the most important factors is in ensuring a greater number of qualified and capable healthcare professionals enter the sector. Equally important is that a greater number of allied healthcare professionals are also being trained. In addition to maintaining an optimal doctor-patient ratio  particularly outside the Western Province, I think it is vital to invest at a national level in the establishment and expansion of medical universities in order to build a pool of talent that is internationally recognized, and this is an area which I believe Sri Lanka has immense untapped potential.
From a market-oriented perspective, providers must work to build greater depth in their procurement methodologies to ensure optimum availability of products and services. We need to enhance our systems in order to ensure that medicine and treatment is available across the country. At a consumer level, there is also more that can be done to educate the public about the impact that their lifestyle choices can have on quality of life. By adopting a holistic strategy that addresses all stakeholders, I believe that we can arrive at a truly progressive outcome for all.
Q: Such wide-reaching action would have to start somewhere. What do you believe are some of the low hanging fruit that that the Government and the private sector can look to over the short-term
A: There are no quick fixes in the healthcare sector and the benefits of any alterations to healthcare policy tend to play over the medium-long term. Nevertheless, one of the best areas to aggressively target would be the development of our diagnostics capabilities. In the healthcare industry, this is often referred to as the Rule of Halves: of those who are diagnosed with a disease, only half receive treatment from a qualified healthcare professional and again just half of these people achieve their treatment targets. Unfortunately, the Rule of Halves does not end there: only half of this relatively small group actually achieve the desired outcome and live a disease-free life.
Essentially, there tends to be an exponential reduction in the number of people who receive treatment relative to those who require it, and ultimately, this is a problem of awareness. If the general public is more aware of what they can do to prevent illness through early diagnosis, parallel to investments to enhance our diagnostic capabilities, I believe that we as a nation can start enjoying the benefits of these investments fairly quickly. Early diagnosis can often pre-empt the need for treatment  which is significantly more complicated and expensive than diagnosis, therefore these investments will be money well spent.
Q: What are some of the areas which the public and private sectors can work together to deliver positive healthcare outcomes
A: There are certainly a few areas with low hanging fruit which can be powerfully leveraged through Public-Private-Partnerships (PPP), and one of the most opportune areas in that regard would be in early detection. I believe that the PPP model will be central to driving successful healthcare outcomes, and there are certainly a wide variety of examples of the PPP model in developed and developing economies that have generated remarkable improvements in the availability and delivery of healthcare products and services.
While the Sri Lankan debate on healthcare has tended to focus solely on issues of affordability, we feel that awareness building can serve a much more powerful role in producing better healthcare outcomes  this is an area, which the Government is best equipped to engage with people and communities across the island. The private sector also needs to join in and find means of contributing to these awareness campaigns by following-up in these areas and providing access to affordable healthcare products and services, and in this manner.
Q: Economic policy tends to dictate investments and growth in the healthcare sector, but what is the potential impact of a progressive health policy in economic performance
A: There is a clear gap in terms of research into pharma-economic dynamics. Hence one of the key recommendations by the SLCPI to the Government has been for the commissioning of robust research into this field to ensure that future policy decisions are evidence-based and clearly reflective of realities on the ground. Such initiatives would naturally result in a much deeper, holistic analysis of the healthcare sector and provide insights into vitally important factors that go beyond simply analyzing the cost of products and infrastructure alone.
There are several other areas to consider: What is the average length for a typical patient at a Government hospital Is the patient better served by opting for a shorter stay that ensures a full recovery but also allows for a reduced cost to the State
Minimal invasive surgery is another area that can have a significant impact on cost reduction and recovery time. Such facilities and services require investments that can seem costly and prohibitive when we only consider the Rupee values of such treatments, however when balanced against the duration of stay, and cost of recovery, the patient and the State healthcare system can both benefit immensely. That is why it is absolutely vital to take a nuanced, well considered, evidence-based approach when deciding macro policy. We need to ensure that we preserve what works and reform what does not.
Ultimately, if we are successful in formulating a well-balanced healthcare system, the impacts of these reforms will be far-reaching, and will most certainly be keenly felt when examined from the perspective of economic performance and productivity. Essentially, if we can make lasting improvements to the health of our national workforce, we will almost certainly benefit from greater productivity combined with a gradual reduction in the cost borne by the state; hence we are confident that this is a win-win scenario for the national, and all of its citizens.
Q: What would be an ideal direction for the Sri Lankan healthcare sector to move in over the next decade
A: Sri Lanka has already the extended its basic and essential healthcare services to all corners of the island under our universal healthcare system. Its clear that the Government can - and should - play a leading role in primary healthcare services moving forward. However when considering global examples, there is a clear trend towards greater investment by the private sector into tertiary care services and facilities.
This speaks to a fundamental shift that occurs in any nation that transitions into a stable middle-income status. Sri Lankan perceptions around healthcare are changing. In the past our people would perceive medical treatment as something paid for only when needed, today we see a more holistic long-term approach that is tied to quality of life. Today, more Sri Lankans look at their healthcare as a proactive investment in their future. This change in mindset is no trivial matter. Regardless of what resistance there may be to change, ultimately, our systems will have to be reformed in order to meet not only the needs, but also the aspirations of all Sri Lankans.
One possible solution would be the creation of a voucher system through which the Government can ensure those in need are given free treatment at private health care facilities, allowing citizens to get the best possible treatment, while saving the Government the expense of actually constructing and operating a fully-fledged hospital.
Instead, the public sector can look to invest in vital allied services like drug assurance laboratories, or set up joint ventures along those lines in order to aggressively test all products coming in to the country thereby ensuring that our citizens are guaranteed medication of a high quality standard. I think the key point from this is that we need to update our ideas on the role of the public and private sectors in the healthcare sector so that we measure success in terms of simply the amount spent of brick and mortar infrastructure given the vast untapped capacity in the private sector.
Q: Has there been any recent policy progress with regard to the establishment of such quality assurance labs
A: The NMRA has clarified that a plan for the establishment of quality assurance laboratories is currently being developed however we would like to have some more clarity on the scheme and its scalability. This is a crucial area for ensuring that our citizens are provided with drugs of an appropriate quality standard therefore, stakeholder consultation can only help to ensuring a positive outcome. The best way forward will be for the establishment of PPPs whereby the private sector is tasked with making investments in infrastructure and capacity under stringent oversight from an impartial and empowered public sector regulator. We are concerned that the Government may not wish to make this transition from actually performing a task, to regulating its performance, but ultimately I think there is a growing recognition that currently, the most important step is to set up a robust regulatory framework
Q: You previously alluded to global changes in the approach to healthcare, what are some of the most important trends that you see specific to the pharmaceutical industry
A: Over the past decade, there has been a drastic improvement in the overall quality of pharmaceutical product in a manner where the molecules have become more precisely targeted. This has been the result of breakthroughs in research and innovation that took place over the past 2-3 decades to the point that we have covered quite a broad spectrum of conditions and there are only a few conditions that we still havent been able to develop some form of treatment. In todays context, we are now seeing more selective innovation and targeting.
The idea of a one-size-fits-all medication is giving way to the understanding that any given medication will vary in its efficacy depending on the personal traits and medical history of each patient. Over a large group therefore, one molecule may work for 80% of the population, but for a small but significant group, it wouldnt have the same efficacy. The advancements that are now being made are mainly to address these types of challenges.
Q: What are some of the key concerns for the SCLPI moving forward
For our part, the SLCPI will continue to engage with the Ministry of Health, the NMRA and all related regulatory authorities to help set policies that are efficacious for all stakeholders. We have been working with these stakeholders to review existing data and we continue to ask for evidence for the positive benefits of price control to the sustainability of the overall healthcare system. Our goal moving forward is merely to ensure that we take a more systematic approach to policy and that we understand that there is no one silver bullet to fix all of the challenges we face. So we must be organized and systemic in our reforms.

SLIATE lacks lecturers for engineering courses
The Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological Education (SLIATE) managed by the Higher Education Ministry, is currently lacking lecturers for their Higher National Diploma in Engineering (HNDE) course.
There should be at least 73 lectures, but at present only 21 lecturers are available within the institute.
The SLIATE management is allegedly indifferent towards the academic needs of students and over 1,000 students undergo HNDE courses at the institute.
A number of irregularities in recruiting lecturers to SLIATE too, has been reported.
The institute was established about 31 years ago, but it is not properly administered to meet the academic requirements of its students, said D. M. Susil Jayapala, a senior Secretary of the SLIATE Students Welfare Association, speaking at a meeting of SLIATE students parents held at the Bingiriya Youth Training Centre in Kurunegala, yesterday.
He also requested the ministers concerned to look into the grievances of students as early as possible.

Spice Girls sign tour contract
The Spice Girls have reportedly all signed off on plans for reunion tour.
The grown-up girl band, Mel B, Mel C, Emma Bunton, Geri Horner and Victoria Beckham, broke music boundaries in the 90s with their girl power message and catchy pop tracks.
Although Geri left the group at the height of their fame in 1998, the Spice Girls popularity has endured, and the five-piece sent their now-adult fans into a frenzy earlier this month by confirming plans for a reunion.
And now TMZ reports that their plans include a full tour, despite fashion designer Victoria, aka Posh Spice, recently shutting down tour talk.
The website reveal that Scary Spice Mel B signed the contract, which details the number and location of concerts and compensation, on February 18, with the others following suit. The gigs will allegedly only be taking place in the U.K. and America.
The women are said to be making $14 million (10 million) each from the comeback, which was masterminded by their former manager Simon Fuller.
The five pop stars met at Geri Horners home recently, with each of them uploading smiling photos of the get together on Instagram.
The last time they performed together was at the 2012 Olympics in London. They also toured in 2007, though plans for a 20th anniversary celebration never materialised in 2016 because Mel C and Victoria refused to be a part of it. Geri, Emma and Mel B got together for a short-lived project they called GEM, though it was abandoned after Geri announced her second pregnancy. Music News

Swift shakes off copyright lawsuit
Taylor Swift can once again breathe easy after a judge dismissed two songwriters copyright lawsuit over her hit Shake It Off.
The 28-year-old singer enjoyed massive chart success worldwide with the catchy tune, which includes the lines: Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play/And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.
But in September 2017, songwriting duo Sean Hall and Nathan Butler filed papers claiming they came up with the line in a hit song they penned 16 years ago. In the lawsuit, the accomplished songwriters alleged that 20 per cent of Shake It Off is their 2001 song Playas Gon Play, recorded by girl group 3LW, due to the lyrics Playas, they gonna play and haters, they gonna hate - and sought substantial financial damages from Swift.
Swift filed to dismiss the case earlier this year, and on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Michael Fitzgerald agreed to do just that.
Fitzgerald looked at the lyrics of both songs as he analysed the case, and had to decide whether or not there was enough similarity between the two tunes protectable lyrics. Music News

Told much, shown less
In this land full of natural wonders and riches, what else is there to aspire to Yet an unsettled feeling hangs in the troubled air. The tourists pour in to bask in the natural glory, whereas a major portion of citizens deserts the land for greener pastures. Why And that question has survived decades without a sane answer.
Like any other author, Shyam Selvadurai likens Sri Lanka to a paradise when he titles his anthology of Sri Lankan English literature as Many Roads Through Paradise.
As far as I know this is the first serious attempt ever made to present an anthology of modern writing in all of them. Since few people can read with equal facility in English, Sinhala and Tamil, the anthologist has fixed on one language for his book and presented his chosen examples from the other two in translation, Richard Simon offers his standpoint on the anthology.
Notable works
Richard Simon. Picture by Ruwan de Silva
However, Simon admits that he did not actually read the whole anthology. Some of the literary excerpts have disheartened him. He could not bear to go on.
If you are into fiction but not much into coffee-table books and business-related text, chances are more that you havent heard of Richard Simon that much. Richard Simon calls himself a hack, not much into fiction. But he has been quoted as one of the finest writers of English in various instances.
The introduction to Richard Simon is quite poles apart from most writers that we have featured in this column. Simon is a professional writer and editor of books, magazines and corporate publications. Formerly into advertising and copywriter, Simon is a published author of several notable works.
Ceylon Tea: The Trade That Made A Nation and Sri Lanka: The Island from Above stand out above the rest owing to its rich information and the extravagant price beyond common mans reach. Ceylon Tea was published to coincide with the sesquicentennial moment of Sri Lankan tea industry, while The Island from Above is a collection of photographs taken of Sri Lankan landscape from the helicopter that follows Simons introduction.
The depressive literary excerpts are not Selvadurais fault, Simon continues.
An anthologist must work with what is available. The sad truth is that, despite its balmy climate, heart-lifting beauty and cultural diversity, modern Sri Lanka is anything but a paradise. Things have got better since the war ended and the man who won it and then lost himself the peace was voted out of office, but for two whole generations this was, to be frank, a bloody miserable country to be a native of, and dangerous to boot.
Such is the fate, Simon adds, of so many of the worlds loveliest places.
Things unsaid
For Simon, Martin Wickramasinghes Gamperaliya (translated into English as Uprooted by Lakshmi de Silva) is a seminal literary work, but it plods.
The action consists mainly of a series of conversations between people who cant really express themselves to one another due to social taboos and their own confusion. Their oblique, laconic exchanges are filled with things unsaid  which, outside the quotation marks, the author tells us about in far too much detail, Simon notes.
According to most Western notions, Simon goes on to add, it is bad writing: showing too little, telling too much. It miniaturizes the work, turning it into a puppet-theatre overshadowed by the looming shape of the string-pulling author.
I suppose the model here was Dostoevsky, and particularly The Brothers Karamazov, but the result reads more like some Soviet propaganda-novel in which Revolutionary ideals and Party policies are turned into simplistic, allegorical tales suitable for semiliterate readers.
But then again, Simon maintains that it is unfair to apply the same criteria one would use to judge a literary novel published in Japanese, French, Russian or English to a novel like Gamperaliya.
Basic techniques
Wickramasinghe was the first really successful Sinhala novelist, the first to produce a solid body of work and the first, perhaps, whose works aspired to the condition of literature. But to compare him with Dostoevsky is unkind; and to judge him in relation to some of his literary contemporaries, such as Joyce or Nabokov, would be downright cruel. This pioneer of the Sinhala novel was still working through the basic techniques of fiction-writing at the time Gamperaliya was published. He had no local models to help him.
Simon then moves on to the celebrated Sri Lankan English writers. Michael Ondaatje is world-famous. Michelle de Kretsers The Hamilton Case is a neat, well-researched assemblage of conventional tropes. But they cannot be considered Sri Lankan English writers.
They are established international authors with Sri Lankan connexions, who made their reputations abroad before they were ever heard of by the reading public here.
David Blackers action novel, A Cause Untrue, is another Sri Lankan English fiction that Simon applauds.
Blacker may not pretend to high art, but the way he builds and paces the tension in this scene could teach many more self-consciously literary writers a thing or two about technique.
Three tips
Writing is mostly done out of envy, Simon elaborates. You should never be a writer if you want to become famous. Be a movie star, he offers a solution. Simon joined the industry because he had a flair for writing. And he took the challenge of surviving in the industry as a freelancer after leaving all the permanent jobs he had in the corporate communications industry.
He offers three tips to would be writers. He begins with the second tip: write, and write. And then he moves on to the first tip: read, and do it profusely.
For instance certain books, I find it difficult to read. What I do is I have some time and finish off reading it because I need to do it.
Then the third tip is not to be jealous. Most of the writing emerges out of either envy or jealousy for fellow human beings. A writer should be clever to steer ahead of it. Richard Simon quotes Shakespeare for being generous sympathetic towards fellow human beings in his works.

Trump plays trump card with FBI
President Trump questioned the intensifying special counsel investigation of his 2016 campaign and his administration while attacking his own national security adviser, the FBI, Hillary Clinton, former president Barack Obama, Democrats in Congress, CNN and others in a remarkable nine-hour span of tweets that included profanity and misspellings.
Posting on Twitter from his Mar-a-Lago estate here, he railed against the latest findings of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and his team, which on Friday filed 13 indictments against Russians and alleged that a St. Petersburg-run interference effort in the 2016 campaign was intended to push voters toward Trump and away from Clinton, his Democratic rival.
Trump has chafed at accusations that he had any help, resisting calls to decry Russian meddling and take more action against it even as he has fired and threatened to fire law enforcement officials investigating him and frequently ranted on Twitter.
I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer, Trump tweeted at 7:33 a.m. Sunday. The Russian hoax was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia  it never did!
About 30 minutes later, he added: If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the U.S. then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America!
Russian government
While unleashing fury on a number of targets, the president had nothing to say about the Russian individuals and three companies indicted, their allegedly elaborate operation and the Russian governments alleged role in running it.
Trump, ensconced at Mar-a-Lago, has so far stayed away from his nearby golf course in what aides describe as a decision intended to show respect for the 17 people killed in a school shooting in Parkland, Fla., last week.
The president has instead spent much of his time watching television and tweeting, aides said. After a string of tweets Saturday afternoon, he dined with talk-show host Geraldo Rivera and the presidents two adult sons before returning to his quarters for more posts.
The tweet that bothered several people around him the most was his direct attack Saturday evening on the FBI  and effectively tying the Parkland massacre to the Russia probe.
Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter, he wrote just after 11 p.m. Saturday. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign  there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!
Attacking the FBI for missing a tip regarding the suspected Florida shooter  a significant blunder that the bureau admitted to Friday  while funerals are still being held for the victims was in itself a remarkable move by the president. The special counsels investigation, which is run separately from the main Justice Department, has nothing to do with the missed tip.
Trump campaign
Trump has pushed for changes at the Justice Department and the FBI, accusing leaders at both agencies of being biased against him.
Whether there was any cooperation between the Trump campaign or its allies with Russia is still under investigation by Muellers team. On Friday, the special counsel described an elaborate Internet system designed to interfere in the election, with workers creating ads, staging rallies, traveling to the United States, and being encouraged to support Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over Clinton. Prosecutors said unwitting Americans were involved but did not accuse any Americans of a crime in the Friday indictments.

Unity Government to forge ahead
Ending the week long tense political standoff following the Local Government elections, the Unity Government of the UNP and SLFP combine decided to continue with their agreement to govern in unison, yesterday.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Parliamentary Group which met President Maithripala Sirisena last afternoon decided to go ahead with the Unity Government. Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara speaking to the Daily News yesterday said the UPFA had initially asked to withdraw from the coalition, but during the meeting with the President, they had decided to continue with the alliance and work for reforms from within.
Meanwhile, following the meeting, Minister S. B. Dissanayake told reporters outside the Presidential Secretariat that the SLFP will not leave the government but will work for changes. We will remain in government to strengthen President Maithripala Sirisena, Dissanayake said. The President at yesterdays meeting had reportedly stressed on the importance of continuing with the Unity Government while introducing necessary reforms. Meanwhile, at a discussion at the Presidents residence in Colombo on Sunday night, President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe are said to have agreed to complete reforms in the government within a short period of time.
Informed political sources said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who too was present during Sundays meeting was instrumental in ironing out differences between the President and the Prime Minister.
Meanwhile, last Friday Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told journalists that his partys position was that the Unity Government should go on.
The Premier said that coalition politics was complex and differences may arise from time to time but the important thing was to forge ahead while finding viable solutions to such issues.
Over the past week, a political crisis had been brewing within the government as the two main parties were undecided whether to work together or go it alone.
The crisis eventually spilled into Parliament where the Speaker granted a three hour debate yesterday to resolve the issue.

Ven. Galagoda Attes contempt of court matter
The Court of Appeal hearing the contempt of court action filed against Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court yesterday fixed further trial for February 27.
In a surprising turn of events, on January 25, 2016 Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over.
Later on, Gnanasara Thera was arrested by police on the charges of contempt of court, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant. Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had referred this Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire about such a complaint.
Through this contempt of Court action, the Homagama Magistrate has sought the Appeal Courts jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Ven. Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court.
He further sought the Courts jurisdiction to take necessary legal action against Ven. Gnanasara Thera if the charges leveled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.
On a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence which comes under Article 105 of the Constitution.

Victorious SL cricketers return
Jubilant Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal praised solidarity and teamwork of his teammates which earned them the much needed series victory in Bangladesh during a press briefing at the Sri Lanka Cricket headquarters following their arrival yesterday.
"We were not just like a team there, we were a family and that unity gave us the winning rhythm. I really appreciate the support given by the SLC president during the recent turbulent times. When everything was going wrong for us, he stood by the team and gave us the morale support to recover, said Chandimal at a press conference.
Our coach Chandika Hathurusingha brought a big difference to the team and the supporting staff has done a great job to get the team on a winning streak. It is great to earn a series win at the beginning of the year," he said.
Chandimal also revealed that the first two defeats in the Tri Nation Series greatly helped them to re-unite and build teamwork.
Man of the Series and Man of the Final in the T20 series Kusal Mendis said that he was highly satisfied with his performance and thanked his teammates and coach for all the support and encouragement.
"I think we played as a team and that is very important. I have to improve my batting while maintaining consistency," he said.
SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala said that he is very happy to see Sri Lankans enjoying a series win, ending a long victory drought.
"We knew that we will bounce back, but it took some time. Head coach Hathurusingha, batting coach Thilan Samaraweera and bowling coach Rumesh Ratnayake have done a tremendous job to get the best out of the individuals while building the winning mentality in them," the SLC president said.
Sumathipala also went on to say that Sri Lanka has a unique brand of cricket which they were unable to maintain in recent times, but this victory indicates that they are regaining that lost glory and will pave a platform to develop the Sri Lankan brand of cricket once again.
Sumathipala also acknowledged Chandimal's improvement as a captain in both Test and T20 formats. "Chandimal showed good temperament as a Test captain in Pakistan and now he has proven his T20 leadership which is a good omen for Sri Lankan cricket," he further said. Head coach Chandika Hathurusingha said climatic and environmental conditions in Bangladesh too helped the Lankans to perform well.
"We built a better communication among players and I personally do not believe my experience as the Bangladesh coach was not the main factor for victory. It is the players who earned it," said Hathurusingha. When asked that this victory will be an assurance for the same T20 team to be retained for the upcoming Nidahas Trophy tri-series against India and Bangladesh, Hathurusingha replied that there is no such assurance in the sport of cricket and the squad will always be picked according to the opposition side and pitch conditions.
He also mentioned that players like Kusal Perera and others who performed well in the past too have the opportunity to enter the Nidahas Trophy squad with improved performances.
Injured captain Angelo Mathews revealed that he might be able to play again very soon and commended world record holder Rangana Herath (highest left-arm wicket-taking bowler in Test cricket) for his long time contribution to Sri Lankan cricket.
"Rangana has been a silent hero for a long time winning many victories for Sri Lanka and he deserves a bigger appreciation.
I feel great to share the series win as a spectator and hopefully will be able to savour many wins as a player in future," he said.

Way forward for January 8
The local government elections being over, the focus has shifted to Parliament where moves have been underway to reconstitute the government. Now a government makeover, reconstitution or reformation is a desirable exercise, given the public dissatisfaction overall, regarding the governments performance at present. The main Sinhala opposition and its political vehicle the SLPP had a higher than expected public response as the election results demonstrate, providing a wake-up call to the coalition government and especially the two main parties that constitute the same. Some salient facts of the current situation and a way forward are as follows.
Mahinda Rajapaksa did not improve on his losing 2015 performance
It was young Oxford scholar Gehan Gunatilleke, who in a well-argued piece right after the election first pointed out that the SLPP, the political comeback vehicle of the Rajapaksas, did not even secure the unsuccessful 5.2 million votes, Mahinda Rajapaksa polled in 2015, despite a higher number of registered voters and a similar turnout. Hence, the vote was more a mid-term protest vote at the government, than sufficient nostalgia for a Rajapaksa return, otherwise Mahinda needed to better his own loosing performance.
Hot on the heels though of the SLPP polling more votes than the two government parties, the UNP and the SLFP, the JO led SLPP called and still calls for a dissolution of parliament and the holding of early general elections. It is surprising for a political party led by a former Professor of Laws, GL Peiris (no relative I hasten to add) being the titular chairman of the SLPP, that the SLPP and the JO demonstrates an ignorance of either the letter or the ethos of constitutional government. The SLPP claims and indeed has a mandate in the local government institutions it has won outright though failing to have a majority in many of the councils in which it is the largest party. However, to use a local government result to try and secure a change in the national government is disingenuous and is neither supported by the letter or the practice of constitutional governance.
What Sri Lanka presently has is the concurrent operation of three mandates, each distinct from each other. President Sirisena has a mandate from the January 8, 2015 Presidential election, Prime Minister Wickramasinghe has a mandate from the August 2015 general election to parliament, in which his party secured the largest number of seats and formed a unity government, which passed its most recent budget, the hallmark of any government by a 2/3rd majority two months ago.
The possible crossover of some SLFP members from the government to the opposition does not detract from the parliamentary election mandate, unless the opposition successfully passes a motion of no confidence in parliament. What the SLPP has is a mandate in a majority of the local government institutions, it should roll up its sleeves and fulfil its responsibilities, not play politics.
A commitment to the mandate of 2015
It has been surprisingly (or perhaps unsurprisingly) the TNA as the third largest party and the official opposition in Parliament which has captured the moral high ground and has argued on principal, for the continuation of the good governance reform mandates of 2015, mandates which were backed fully by their constituencies in the North and East and indeed convincingly in the rest of the country. Now JO theoreticians and indeed Mahinda Rajapaksa have articulated that the minority voice does not count and their now clearly dominant faction of the SLFP reflects the wishes of the majority ethno-religious community. But mercifully despite Sri Lankas many shortcomings as a pluralist state, we do not constitutionally have second class citizens and everyones vote counts equally.
The real lesson of both the 2015 elections and the 2018 election would be that the people supported then the good governance reforms platform on which President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe were elected. Hence their disappointment is more likely with the poor implementation of the needed reforms they backed, rather than a lack of support for the reforms. The way forward then is to recommit to and work towards the implementation of the good governance reform programme, the economic, governance and reconciliation reforms Sri Lanka so badly needs. What we dont require is a return to the past.
It has been Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who in a wide-ranging press conference after the LG election results, attributed the governments poor showing to sub-optimal economic performance. Also mentioned by other leaders including the President during the election campaign has been the governments inability to bring to book many of the culprits of the previous regime accused of corruption, gross mismanagement and abuse of power. In the best traditions of democracy, the law and order minister who holds direct responsibility for the criminal justice system and investigative agencies has offered to resign and may well be assigned a different portfolio in an impending Cabinet reshuffle.
JO weak in Parliament
The political reality in Sri Lanka, is that defeated in 2015, the Rajapaksas lost the presidency, a parliamentary majority and indeed control of the SLFP. It may well have compensated for the latter by successfully launching the SLPP. Certainly, the Pohottuwa party never seems to be short of money. Wonder where it all comes from But the numbers in Parliament still stand largely in support of a reconstituted government but continued implementation of the mandates of 2015.
The 19th Amendment to the constitutions non-dissolving feature actually first proposed by the JVP, was created for just a situation such as now. To prevent an exercise of executive political power to overturn a public mandate. Parliament needs to run its term or decide themselves to go for a dissolution. The mandate of 2015 has two components, one is a term of office, five years and the other is the programme of reforms. Both are important and neither has been completed. For the good of Sri Lanka, both must continue.

Wear your heart on your weave!
Unstitched or stitched, tucked or pleated, neoprene or linen, with a blouse or not - the versatility of the saree turns heads. If you enjoy draping yourself in these six yards of elegance and grace, especially imported from the looms of India then you are in for a treat. Well known actress, Miss Sri Lanka Pancontinental 2015 and law graduate Alanki Kishani Perera has always proven that she embodies a versatile personality. The young lady has embarked on yet another diverse venture  into the realm of entrepreneurship as she launched Radha, a boutique for ethnic and traditional sarees.
From acting to being selected as a beautycontestant to represent Sri Lanka, beinga law graduate and now a Businessentrepreneur. How different are thesethree field
These three fields are all very different and unique. However all three were very demanding of time and commitment too. But I never had the ambition of being involved in all three!
I had always wanted to pursue a professional career but destiny had other plans for me. As a child I had always wanted to pursue my higher studies and therefore after my schooling education I completed my law degree through the external system of university of London international programmes. However prior to my studies, I was involved in acting and had to reject my acting offers until I completed my LLB. I was then selected to represent Sri Lanka in the first every Miss Pancontinental in the Philippines as Miss Sri Lanka Pancontinental. It was only after that, that I had the time to really consider my mums idea of opening up a saree boutique. Even though she had always had this idea, I never had the time to commit to a business venture with my other projects and studies. Being a business entrepreneur had paved the way for many more opportunities and a whole new level of experiences.
Why did you decide to venture into business
My mum had always had a major passion for sarees and has an extremely good eye for sarees. She had always accompanied me to my shoots and supported me in all my endeavours so I thought we should give this idea a try and it turned out to be a great decision!
I also believe that it is important to have more than one career path for a woman. With entrepreneurship comes responsibility yet it also gives you a great level of freedom of being able to make your own choices and to express your own creativity at work.
What sets Radha by Alanki Collectionapart from other brands of sarees
Radha offers an exquisite collection of sarees for both daily wear and special occasions. We have an elegant collection of sarees in different types of silks and fabrics. What makes Radha special is that we import only one in each saree, thereby ensuring exclusivity. We have a wide collection for sarees in different designs and styles, catering for all age groups. Radha had an ethnic collection of sarees in bold tribal prints and natural dyes portraying the heritage and culture of the different regions of India from where we import the sarees. Since each region in India have different weaving techniques and different cultures, each of these sarees are unique to that particular region and therefore Radha has a variety of different styles. Radha also offers beautiful floral prints and vintage prints and sarees in pastel hues. Our cotton sarees are also very popular among many working women. My mum and I put a lot of thought and effort in handpicking each and every saree from our suppliers.
What is your perception about the saree suiting theSri Lankan/ Asian woman
I believe that a woman is best dressed and well dressed in a saree! Nothing really makes a woman looks as graceful as when she is in a saree. I believe that saree looks best on Sri Lankan and Asian women.
Saree is the one attire, which ensures youll possess the silhouette of a graceful lady. There is no one particular colour that suits Sri Lankan women. With regards to what colour, design or material suits Sri Lankan women, I think it depends largely on your complexion, figure and your personality. Almost anything looks good if a woman has confidence to carry it off!
How did the name originate
My mum came up with the name, Radha. We are huge fans of Radha Krishna (Indian goddess and partner of Krishna) and used to collect antiques and ornaments of Radha Krishna. Enthralled by that romance and love story, we decided to name it Radha.
Is Radha purely sarees
Yes we only provide sarees at the moment and have not really decided to expand into other clothing items. It is best to focus on sarees so that we could always give the best to our clients!
Who is your targeted clientele
We have many working women who buy our cotton sarees and most of our client purchase sarees for weddings. Our most popular clientele include brides mothers since we offer a grand selection of exclusive sarees and brides and grooms mothers always want to look their best at the wedding.
Who are your fashion icons and why do you admire theirsense of style
I love Deepika Padukone. I feel that it is not always about what you wear but about how you carry it and how good you look. I feel that her sense of style is very versatile and she looks good in both ethnic wear and western wear!
What do you find exciting about this venture
We love meeting our clients. We have made new friendships and it is always satisfying to see someone wear a saree by Radha. It would be two years since we opened Radha in April and it has been a worthwhile and fulfilling experience.
What are your future plans for Radha
We wish to expand Radha and maybe move to a bigger space. We would continue to provide unique and exquisite sarees and maintain our standards in quality.
Do you hope to continue with acting in the future
Yes I do hope to continue acting if I get offered worthwhile roles. Acting has always been a hobby for me but it is also one of my greatest passions.
