Pakistan, Sri Lanka agree to points system for England tour
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has agreed to a proposal forwarded by the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to apply a points system for their tour of England scheduled in July.

"We have received an agreement in principle from the boards of both Sri Lanka and Pakistan and will release further details of the proposal in due course," an ECB spokesman told ESPNCricinfo.

England will copy the format of the womens Ashes with points awarded for winning a Test, one-dayer and Twenty20 when they play Sri Lanka and Pakistan. These will be added up and an overall winner decided. It will be the first time it has happened in mens international cricket.

Pakistan will be playing four Tests, five ODIs and one T20I against the Englishmen from July to September in a two-month tour. According to the points system, four points will be awarded for winning a Test match while two points will be up for grabs for each victory in ODIs and T20Is.

With a total of 28 points to be played for and Tests preceding the rest of the series, a 4-0 win for any team might seal the over-all series for one side with 16 points in their tally. (CricketNext)

Cycle motor cheat banned
The UCI global cycling governing body banned Fenke Van den Driesscshe of Belgium for six years for the first recorded case of using hidden motors in racing.
The organisation hailed a new scanner which detected the electric motor as a major breakthrough in the war against the sport's latest cheats.
The motor was found in a bike used by the under-23 European cyclo-cross champion at the under-23 World Championships in Belgium in January.
The 19-year-old was banned for six years and fined 20,000 Swiss francs ($20,000/18,180 euros). All of Van den Driessche's results from October last year have been annulled and she was ordered to return all prize money and medals.
The magnetic resonance scanner used by the UCI quickly detects motors, magnetic fields and solid objects concealed in a frame or components, the federation statement said.
