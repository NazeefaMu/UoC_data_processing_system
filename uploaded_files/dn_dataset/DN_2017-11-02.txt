No need to reduce alcohol taxes
Unlike in the Western countries, in Sri Lanka almost 70 percent of the population totally abstains from alcohol. Therefore, the most important objective of our alcohol policy and any taxation formula should be to maintain this group in the same state of affairs. NATA would earnestly appeal to the policy makers to ensure that no tax reduction on any type of liquor is considered, National Tobacco and Alcohol Authority Chairman Dr. Palitha Abeykoon said.
According to Dr. Abeykoon, the second main objective should be to prevent initiation into alcohol of the young and the school children. Any reduction of the taxes on soft liquor will threaten the above situation. If people are drinking hard liquor in excessive amounts the obvious solution is not to reduce the price of beer and other soft liquor but to increase the prices of the hard liquor.
Dr. Abeykoon said that there seem to be some inadvertent, but obvious inaccuracies and misconceptions in the recent statements made by responsible individuals on the situation with regard to alcohol use in Sri Lanka. NATA and the Health Ministry have shown with hard evidence, the Health Care costs and the loss of income due to productivity losses together are significantly more than money that is earned as alcohol taxes (Rs. 106 billion vs. Rs. 142 billion in 2015).
The statement that keeping liquor shops closed on Poya days leads to a loss of revenue is without any evidence whatsoever. This statement is also inappropriate when we consider the psychological and culturally symbolic value of this decision. Certainly it is not going to have a significant adverse effect on our tourism. It is not a credible argument that a significant number of tourists would refrain from visiting Sri Lanka if the bars are kept closed on Poya days. This is a red herring, he said.
The belief that reducing the taxes on beer and wine will help to curtail the production of illicit liquor is another myth.
The arguments and comments could even be seen as inspired statements that have probably been promoted by some people in the industry itself and may be attempts to divert attention from any new taxes and regulations in the period up to the budget, he added.

Parents protest over school relocation plans
A big gathering of parents, past pupils and well-wishers of Galle All Saints College staged a protest against the governments decision to relocate the school premises out of Galle Fort yesterday.
The protestors numbering over 500 came in a protest march from the college to Galle District Secretariat and launched their demonstration opposite the secretariat obstructing the Colombo- Matara highway. They sat on the highway shouting slogans against the states decision.
Subsequently, a delegation of the demonstrators met Galle District Secretary S.T. Kodikara and handed over a petition opposing the move to relocate the school away from the Galle Fort.
Galle Heritage Foundation President Charted Architect Channa Daswatte addressing the media had disclosed the governments move to relocate 15 state institutions including All Saints College located in the Galle Fort out of the ancient Dutch Fortress locality before December end this year.
All Saints College is the most pristine educational institution which was founded in 1867 under the benefaction of the Anglican Church. The college was initially established for the purpose of educating the children of the Dutch trading community, reliable chronicles testify.

Debate on Interim Report to continue until Nov. 5: Chairman, Constitutional Assembly
The debate on the interim report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms would continue on November 05 too before the Constitutional Assembly.
The Constitutional Assembly yesterday, decided to continue with the debate on the Interim Report of the Steering Committee today, though it was planned to wind up yesterday.
However, later the Party Leaders had decided to continue with the debate on November 05 too.
However, the Chairman of the Constitutional Assembly Karu Jayasuriya observed yesterday morning, that he had decided to extend the duration of the three day debate by one more day due requests made by the MPs seeking for more time to speak.
He said that a large number of MPs have asked for additional time and pointed out the need for each member to speak on the debate.
The Assembly had previously allocated three days from Monday to Wednesday for the debate. On Monday, the debate started at 10,30 am and continued till 6.30 pm. One Tuesday and Wednesday the debate continued till 8 pm.
Both the Government and Opposition MPs participated in the debate, while some Opposition MPs complained that they were not given time to participate in the debate, while some others complained that the time allocated to them was insufficient.
Chairman Karu Jayasuriya said that 17 members who were in the list to participate in the debate on Tuesday, could not participate in the debate due to lack of time. He added as per their requests and also a request by the Leader of the House Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella, Chairman Jayasuriya decided to extend the duration of time by one more day.
Constitution should be drafted with approval of all: Minister Ranawaka
The proposals for the new Constitution comes out as a representation of views of all, whereas all the previous came on the whims and fancies of political parties, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday.
He also said that a Constitution should be drafted on the approval of the majority of the minority.
He made these observations yesterday, during the debate on the interim report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms which was held in Parliament.
Minister Ranawaka stated that the foundation of the new Constitution is the state of stability and democracy.
He added that the stance on the unitary status of the country is very clear. "Our stance is that the second clause of the 1978 Constitution should be kept intact in the new Constitution," Minister Ranawaka said.
"There should be unitary status for the Northern People to come to the South and vice versa. India has not yet been able to implement a tax policy applicable to the whole country as they do not have a unitary status. The Unitary Status is required for economic planning."
He stated that power devolution would not support the Tamil People, since only 45 percent of the Tamil people live in the North. He added that the proper solution for them is to work along with the governments and get their issues solved.
He also added that the Tamil People did not get their dues, since Tamil politicians deviated from the main political stream.
He said further that the economic stability should be included in the new Constitution.
"The concept of secular comes from European discipline," said Minister Ranawaka.
"But we have a Buddhist civilization. The Constitution has guaranteed the right to other religions and we need not change them."
He also said that those parties who asked for the abolishing of the executive presidency should not contest at the Presidential election.
TNA MP says Opp. Leader deprived him of expressing his views on Interim Comm. Report
Wanni District TNA Parliamentarian Sivashakthi Anandan yesterday, accused Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan for depriving him of his right to express his views on the interim committee report of the steering committee of the Constitutional Assembly.
The Chairman of the Assembly observed that he would take up the matter at the Party Leader's meeting.
When the Assembly commenced sittings, MP Anandan complained that he had been denied from participating in the debate. TNA comprises of four parties. I am the General Secretary of one of those parties," MP Anandan said. "I have represented the Wanni district for the past 16 years. But the Opposition Leader did not permit me to partake in the debate. The Opposition Leader violated my privileges as an MP. I spoke to the Speaker twice asking for time for me to speak."
He said he asked for time to express the problems of his people. "Please assure that there would be no injustice in future," MP Anandan said. "The Opposition Leader did not answer my calls. I have a right to express my opinion. This is an example of Opposition Leader preventing a member of his own party from taking part in the debate. If I am not given a chance to speak here, I would leave this place. There is no point of my being here without my being unable to speak. Chairman Karu Jayasuriya said the list of the participants in the debate from the Opposition was prepared by the Leader of the Opposition and he would take the matter at the Party Leaders meeting.
SLMC Leader says doubtful whether BASL a cats paw of some other group
SLMC Leader and Minister Rauf Hakeem yesterday pitched into the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) over the recent list of questions on Constitutional Amendments it sought answers from the Government.
The minister, taking part in the Constitutional Assembly debate yesterday, said he has doubts as to whether the BASL is acting as the cats paw of some other group.
BASL is a highly respected professional body comprising of legal practitioners in which we are also members.
Those in it must be able to read and interpret the report themselves. Without doing that, it has directed questions on the Government. This could be to agitate people by creating a wrong impression, the minister noted. The minister, replying to the BASL question as to whether unitary status would be changed to federal in the Constitution, noted the inclusion of the word unitary or federal alone would not make sure the country is unitary or federal.
For example the Soulbury Constitution we had did not contain the word unitary but still ours was a unitary country. Indias Constitution does not say it is federal, but still it is a federal country.
Despite how much we say that there are provisions for an undivided and indivisible country, doubts of separatism are being repeatedly raised. It is puzzling as to how could the BASL not understand this basic fact, he added.
Constitutional proposals: All misinterpretations and lies: Anura Kumara
The hue and cry outside Parliament against the draft Constitutional proposals is driven by half-truths, misinterpretations and lies, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
The MP was taking part in the Constitutional Assembly debate on the Interim Report yesterday. The MP pointed out that the Joint Oppositions noise inside the Constitutional Assembly is much less than its clamour outside.
Dont let the much important public discussions on the Constitution be suppressed by the empty noises of the racist and tribal political agenda. The defeated political elements try to seize ruling power again by using the Interim Report as a football. The utterances to bomb Parliament is the climax of that fanatical objection to constitution-making exercise, he noted.
I will predict the political slogan of the upcoming Local Government polls. The JO would ask the people to use LG polls as a referendum to register the opposition to divide the country. This is entire a political campaign. The Constitution making is a lengthy process and it would take many more months for the final draft to come to Parliament, he added.
The JVP Leader said his party is for a wise dialogue on the Constitution, adding that they wished the fundamental rights Chapter be expanded to include many more progressive proposals. Only those with tribal mentality who do not care about human rights could object to these Constitutional proposals. We accept equal rights of all people, irrespective of the language they speak, their religion or culture, he commented. He also stressed that the North cannot survive alone without the socio-economic support of the South and therefore, it is nave to think that the North would at any point demand secession from the South. The market for goods and vegetables in the North is in Colombo and there is an acute water scarcity in the North. Asking for secession would be the biggest injustice to the people in the North. Therefore we are for including all possible provisions to prevent secession of the country, he remarked.
It is unfortunate former President, his allies taking contradictory stand to what they had said: Sampanthan
The inability of the leaders to stand to what they accept and keep to their commitments after they cease to hold power, had been a major setback to the country, Opposition Leader R Sampanthan said.
Opening the Constitutional Assembly debate on the Interim Report for the third day yesterday, the Opposition Leader quoted sections of statements by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Minister Prof. G L Peiris that advocated for greater devolution of power.
It is unfortunate that the former President and his allies are taking diametrically different and contradictory stand to what they had said, he said, after citing the exact words of former President Rajapaksa at the inauguration of the APRC on July 11, 2006 and Prof G L Peiris during the Oslo Conference in 2002.
The past three Presidents and Governments came up with proposals for sharing power that went far beyond the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, said Sampanthan, referring to the past endeavours of Mahinda Rajapaksa, Chandrika Kumaratunga and R Premadasa. He added President Maithripala Sirisena was continuing with those endeavours from where those had been stopped.
Sampanthan also elaborated on the contents of the Bandaranaike - Chelvanayagam pact in 1957, the Dudley - Chelvanayagam pact in 1965 and the Indo - Lanka Agreement signed by President JR Jayewardene and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1987.
They were prepared to deal with issues and they had the knowledge and capacity in the countrys interest to do what was required, he added.
It is more than eight years since the war came to an end, but the causes for the commencement of the war have not yet been addressed yet. It would be a tragedy not to realize that the war commenced due to the non-resolution of the national question and that the national question yet remains unsolved, he emphasised.
It is a well known fact that our National Issue had become internationalised because of the blunders we have committed and because we have not been able to amicably resolve the national question ourselves. We should realize that we are being watched by the whole world. We have been cooperating with the present Government because we wish for the problems to be solved domestically, but remember, if you do not do so, international pressure would only worsen, he said.
You received the support of all the main countries to defeat the LTTE, including India, UK, US Canada, EU and Australia. The LTTE was banned in all those countries. You assured the world that there would be an acceptable resolution of the national question after the defeat of the LTTE. Can you abandon the said assurances and commitments made to the world The international pressure the country faced especially since 2012, was due to the failure of the Government to address the national question. Things could only get worse; they cannot get any better, if the same situation continues, Sampanthan stressed.
Sampanthan, pointing out that the TNA had never demanded separatism, said they appeal to the Tamil speaking people not to lend their support to any political movement that advocates division in the country. We want the people of this country to oppose any candidate who espouses separatism, he noted.
Tamil people of the North-East have been absolutely clear in regard to the manner and mode of power-sharing, particularly in the North East. Violence was unleashed against the Tamil people whenever they made legitimate political demands, he recalled.
The exercise of making the Constitution is a prerequisite to sustainable peace, development and progress. There will be power sharing at three levels, national, provincial and local. The powers related to these three levels must be unambiguously and clearly defined on a rational basis.
Constitutional provisions would ensure the devolved power is not undermined or taken back. This ensures that the sharing of power is durable and also genuine, he explained.
The TNA is committed to the democratic verdict of the people. We are willing to work towards a reasonable and acceptable consensus on all issues. We appeal to all irrespective of party or other affiliations to join in this national endeavour, he urged.
As a Sri Lankan, I plead everyone to be truthful to the country and its people. It is nave to think that everybody can be deceived all the time. It is the people who must make the final decision in the exercise of their sovereignty, the Opposition Leader concluded.

Pathfinder participates in enhancing Bay of Bengal Regional Cooperation Conference
Pathfinder participated in a conference themed 'Connecting the Bay of Bengal: India, Japan, and Regional Cooperation', organized by Carnegie India and India Development Foundation in collaboration with the government of Japan, which was held recently in New Delhi.
This seminar was to review Indo-Japanese regional economic and security cooperation and identify new possibilities in two areas  regional connectivity corridors and maritime security in the Bay of Bengal. The former theme was focused on sustainable development of trans-border regional infrastructure. The latter was focused on the regional maritime cooperation in the Bay of Bengal.
The conference commenced with a closed-door breakfast meeting/discussion with the speakers and ambassadors of the region based in New Delhi. Sri Lankan High Commissioner for India, Chithrangani Wagiswara, Sumith Nakandala, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage participated in this discussion. Carnegie India Director Dr. C Raja Mohan moderated the session with Japanese Ambassador for India Kenji Hiramatsu and Sumith Nakandala delivering theme setting remarks.
The inaugural session was attended by Dr S Jaishankar, Indian Foreign Secretary who spoke about Indias viewpoint on the Bay of Bengal region and the importance of Japan-India relations.
Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage presented a paper during the session on Regional Maritime Security Cooperation titled Sri Lanka as a Hub for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Operations.
The Admiral thanked the Indian Navy for providing immediate assistance to Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the Boxing Day tsunami in 2004. Admiral Colombage spoke about various types of common disasters in the region, both natural and man-made and the importance of providing timely humanitarian assistance.
He highlighted the need for preparedness and response plans for effectively responding and mitigating a disaster. He indicated the lack of progress made by SAARC Disaster Management Centers established in 2005 and compared the steady and successful progress made by ASEAN countries in establishing a ASEAN Humanitarian Assistance Center (AHA center) in Indonesia aimed at facilitating cooperation and coordination among ASEAN members.
The Admiral went on to present a case for Sri Lanka as a hub for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Operations for South Asia.
Admiral Colombage argued that Sri Lankas unique advantage in the India Ocean is the geographical location. Sri Lanka is located in the centre of the Indian Ocean, almost equal distance from the eastern and western Indian Ocean littorals. Further, Sri Lanka is located just 12 nautical miles from the busiest east-west shipping route across this ocean, linking Europe, Americas, Far East, Middle East and Asia, which is considered a key shipping lane in the 21st century. Sri Lanka is blessed with deep-water ports and deep navigable waters around the country and especially along the approaches to major ports. Port of Colombo is the only port in the region which is capable of docking and handling even the latest version of mega container ships.
Sri Lanka maintains a balanced and equi-distance diplomatic posture and is considered to be a friendly country by many countries. Sri Lanka is the only country in this region, where all states arrive without any restrictions, be that Indians, Chinese, Pakistanis or Americans.
Sri Lanka is well connected digitally to the world and possesses an advanced telecommunication network. Sri Lanka is also enjoying well connected aviation network linking major cities in the region and beyond. Sri Lanka has already taken leadership roles in the India Ocean with Indian Ocean as Zone of Peace initiative, its role in creating SAARC and creating of UNCLOS.
Sri Lanka has presently taken the initiative to discuss a Code of Conduct for Major Maritime Users in the Indian Ocean region and a new Indian Ocean Order. Sri Lanka has also taken effective measures for disaster response with a well-established Disaster Management Center (DMC) under government patronage.
The DMC coordinate all the stakeholders, both domestic and foreign agencies in responding to disasters rapidly, in a coordinated manner. Considering these factors, Sri Lanka would be the most suitable location to act as a hub for HADR in the Indian Ocean Region.

PHSA initiates kidney-disease identification programme
The Provincial Health Service Authority (PHSA) has embarked on a programme to identify persons in the North Central Province (NCP) who are unknowingly prey to kidney diseases. It is learnt that the number of kidney patients in the province is exceeding 19,000 at present. In this background, mobile blood testing units are being detailed to travel from village to village for blood-testing purposes at MOH divisions,
Dr. Palitha Bandara of the PHSA told the Daily News.
In the meantime, according to the hospital sources, dialysis treatment facilities are available only at a number of limited hospitals including the Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura main hospitals and at Hingurakgoda, Medirigiriya, Thambuttegama, Padaviya, Kebithigollewa and Medawachchiya hospitals. There are 14 dialysis machines at Polonnaruwa and 28 at Anuradhapura teaching hospital.
The number of machines available at other 6 hospitals are altogether 31 only. The burning problem is not the machines, but the dearth of trained staff to serve in the units.
I need minimum of 20 well-trained doctors and 45 nursing staff further to run the dialysis units in full swing. Due to the scarcity of trained staff, the dialysis service is becoming slow and inefficient, thus endangering the life of the CKDu patients, Dr. Palitha Bandara said.
It is learnt that there are 284 CKDu patients registered for dialysis treatment at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital and 140 at the Polonnaruwa General Hospital. In addition, it is believed that there are about 300 CKDu patients who need to be given dialysis treatment that have not been registered. A CKDu patient needs dialysis for three times per month and the government spends nearly Rs. 30,000 per one patient per month.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, referring to the issue, told the Daily News that it has been proposed to appoint nursing assistants after one year of training in dialysis treatment and attach them to the dialysis units at the hospitals under the supervision of senior trained nurses. There are 31,000 nurses attached to our hospitals at present and we need another 6,000 - 10,000 trained nurses soon. There are only 450 dialysis machines in operation at present in the hospitals. It will be increased up to 1,000 by the end of the year. Another 900 machines will come from India. It should be mentioned that there were only 150 dialysis machines when we came in to power. However, steps will be taken to strengthen the dialysis treatment service in NCP in view of the fast-spreading kidney disease menace in the zone, the minister added.

PM calls for novel plans from investors in IT
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe urged investors and the entrepreneurs in the Information Technology sector to come up with novel plans to face the global market challenges.
The Prime Minister was addressing the 25th year anniversary of Infortel 2017, held under the theme 25 years and beyond-towards a digital economy.

Police aiming to climb up in rankings
The first records of Police rugby go back to 1880s where a team of Police officers participated in a rugby game at the Kew Garden Park in Malay Street, Slave Island in 1881. In 1891 a team from the Pettah Police Station played a rugby match.
In 1961 Police SC playing in the B Division were permitted to play alongside the Division A clubs. The expanded competition, allowed all thirteen clubs to play each other once on a home and away basis in alternate years and at the end of the season the best eight teams went on to play in a knock-out tournament for the Clifford Cup.
The Police Sports Club was promoted to Division A in 1967 and in the first year they made it to the Clifford Cup finals, defeating Dickoya MCC in the quarter-final and CR & FC in the semi-final before losing the final to Havelock Sports Club 311. They won their first Clifford Cup in 1970 under the captaincy of Abdul Majeed, forcing a draw in the final 66 with Havelock SC. The club went on to win its first Clifford Cup outright in 1972 when led by Anton Benedict defeating Colombo CH&FC 129. In the following year Police SC participated in another drawn Cup final, this time with Army SC.
The club won its first Division A League title, which was then known as the John Player League in 1979, under the captaincy of Charles Wijewardene and retained the title in the following year (1980) led by Nimal Lewke. They were successful again four years later in 1984 under Upali Vithanage, winning the Clifford Cup. Police SC went on to win six consecutive League titles from 1984-89. During this period the club won numerous Sevens wins and clinched the triple crown (the League title, Sevens and Clifford Cup) twice. In 1985 under the leadership of Sunil Sahabandu, they were unbeaten in the League, won the Clifford Cup by defeating Havelock SC 22-16 and were also victorious in the Sevens competition. In 1986 under H. Premasiri they retained the League title, and in 1987 under Asiri Muruga Jayaratne they won the League title and the Sevens. In 1988 Ajantha Samarakoon captained them to win a double again. In 1989 they enjoyed their most successful season under Hafeel Marso clinching the triple crown.
In 1990 they were heading the League points table at the end of the first round but had to withdraw from the competition due to the LTTE war. In 1991 under Hemantha Yatawara Police won the League and Clifford Cup, their last titles to date. In the last couple of seasons they have consecutively won the Plate title but have failed to progress any further.
Police SC will be captained by their hardy hooker Jayanga Silva, who is an old boy of Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa for the 2017/18 rugby season.
Players who have left to other clubs this season are national players in the likes of Mohamad Abzal (Navy SC), Terence Henry (CH and FC), Musheen Faleel (Navy SC) and Udara Gayan (CR & FC). But even with their presence it did not pay off well for the cops in their last season obtaining a disasters 7th position in the Dialog A Division Inter Club League tournament and crashing out in the quarter finals of the Dialog Clifford Cup knock out tourney.
The new players who have joined Police this year are ex-Zahira College fly half Hasan Sinhawansa, experienced club rugby player and hooker Lahiru Pawithra, former Vidyartha College prop Hashan Fernando and old Peterite fierce third row forward Sajith Seram.
This year the Police team is coached by veteran rugby coach Shamly Nawaz who has a vast experience in the coaching field and Chammika Ranasinghe will be the Assistant Manager of the Police rugby team.
Police will come out for the first time this season against Havelocks Sports Club in the curtain raiser on November 4th at Havelock Park with the kick off at 6:30pm.

Putting human rights at the forefront
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday urged the media to voice the injustices done to journalists who were murdered, abducted and forced to leave the country under the previous regime.
Premier Wickremesinghe also pointed out that media at present does not speak of things which are worthy of discussion. He also requested the media to continue raising public awareness on human rights.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made these observations at the launching ceremony of the National Action Plan for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights 2017-2020 which was held at the Parliament premises yesterday.
A new website was also launched by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as part of the action plan.
Addressing the gathering, Premier Wickremesinghe expressed his gratitude to Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera for his contribution to the launching of this National Action Plan when he was the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
I have appointed a committee comprising Cabinet ministers to oversee the National Action Plan. Another committee has been appointed under the guidance of Minister Sagala Ratnayaka. This committee should submit monthly progress reports on the programme. And the committee should sit every three months for review as well, the Prime Minister said.
Speaking further on the National Action Plan, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the present plan is a well designed one with no controversies.
We will do our best to protect human rights in this country. That is one of the main objectives of this government headed by President Maithripala Sirisena. We need to remember that there was a time when peoples rights were compromised. There were issues in the judiciary system. The Chief Justice had to face injustices. The people were terrorized. Human rights were re-established when the present government was elected, Premier Wickremesinghe pointed out.
The Prime Minister also pointed out that since the previous regime did not secure human rights, it paved the way for social injustice, racial extremism and religious tension in the country. The Premier also pointed out that a political power struggle should in no way have any influence over basic human rights.

THE QUEEN'S GIFT
Today, the administrative center of the University of Colombo, the College House, then known as Regina Walawwa is a well preserved model of ancient Sri Lankan Colonial architecture that is still functioning. The Daily News speaks to Melbourne School of Design, Architect Prof. Anoma Pieris on the College House. Pieris, an associate Professor in architecture, at the University of Melbourne is also the author of Architecture and Nationalism in Sri Lanka: The trouser under the cloth. Her argument in this book is that due to our colonial history Sri Lankans tend to negotiate between western and eastern influences in their lives, projecting one or the other as the dominant expression according to the perceived advantage.
Anoma Pieris
The architecture of College House captures a moment in the history of the region and our country when colonial architecture was becoming indigenized due to firstly, the influence of the arts and crafts movement in England which produced a kind of Victorian eclecticism influenced by architecture elsewhere in the British Empire and secondly, Indian nationalism, which inspired early Lankan nationalists. Similarly, the university originates in a colonial institution modeled on western traditions that has been indigenized, said Pieris.
Regina Walawwa, as it was known then, has an asymmetrical plan with turrets and conical roofs influenced by Victorian Eclecticism. It has few rooms, with numerous verandahs at the front, back and sides of the building, while a rectangular lawn spreads out before its entrance.
Eclecticism, which emerged as a style at the end of the 19th century in Britain, owes its asymmetrical plans and elevations to the influence of the picturesque and renewed interest in the rustic character of the rural vernacular. Based on these ideas, Architects of the Arts and Crafts movement developed long narrow plans of one room depth with an absence of interior corridors. Eccentric elevations with towers or turrets are also a feature of this style, as is the incorporation of Classical, Gothic and Indian or Indic architectural features. Accordingly, Regina Wallawwa's interior spaces are organized quite informally in comparison with the symmetrical house plans and elevations of the conventional neo-classical mansions, explained Pieris.
Built in 1912
Regina Walawwa, was built by Thomas Henry Arthur de Soysa for his wife Regina Perera Abeyewardene of Closenburg, Galle in 1912, and the road beside it Regina Para [anglicised as Queens Road] was named after her. He was the son of philanthropist Charles Henry de Soysa whose statue is found opposite the Eye Hospital.
These wealthy families in Colombo were caught between two cultures, indigenous and colonial, and they had to tread carefully in that space. But by the early twentieth century they grew bold enough to bring their Eastern sensibilities to the front in these various forms.
When building, the carpenters however would have been from Moratuwa, as the de Soysas were prominent leaders of the Karave caste. Teams of carpenters would move from home to home conducting repairs and there were many outbuildings at the back of such properties to accommodate their activities. The contractors at Alfred House, the house of Thomass father, C. H. de Soysa in the same area included the head contractor Omaru Baas and Davith Singho Baas, and they would often collaborate with Muslim masons, pointed out Pieris.
There seems to be an element of sadness associated with the building as it was the family home for Arthur, Regina and their five children, but unfortunately she died before it was complete. Arthur and the children continued to live in the house till it was sold to the government.
Arthur became increasingly conscious of Indian nationalism and even visited Motilal Nehrus house Ananda Bhawan (later called Swaraj Bhawan) in Allahabad in 1904, and copied the dressing table he saw there, producing one each for his three daughters. The wedding of his eldest daughter, Violet, was held at Regina walawwa, and the wedding pavilion-magul maduwa - was designed according to a Hindu architectural style designed by experts from Jaffna, D.P. Tampo and S. Mahadeva of the Public Works Department (PWD). It had an arched dome similar to the style at the Thirumalai Palace, Madurai, said Pieris.
Travancore Style
The architecture of Regina Walawwa follows the Travancore Style of British architect Robert Chisholm, best represented in his designs for the Napier Museum in Trivandrum and the Madras Post and Telegraph Office built during the 1870s1880s. One of the features of this style, particularly in domestic architecture is that the plan is not symmetrical but has elements like wings that finger out, and have long singly-loaded corridors. These are features of Regina Walawwa.
College house was a domestic building later used as an institution. This often happens when stately homes are sold off or gifted to institutions which maybe better able to maintain them. A similar example would be the home of Wilmot Perera on the Sri Palee campus which was similarly indigenized to reflect his connections with China.
On March 8, 1989, elements of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna assassinated the Vice Chancellor, Prof Stanley Wijesundera at the Library Room in the College House.
I was a university student studying architecture at Moratuwa University at that time, and I recollect this period vividly. As state institutions, universities are regarded as representing state agendas and our government had sorely neglected specific social constituencies in the deep- south and the north and east prompting their radicalization. We need many more universities for such a large population as ours and more importantly, vocational colleges that broaden our understanding of education to become more democratic and inclusive. These need to be better distributed across our geography and give dignity and offer professionalization for a range of skills and competencies, explained Pieris.
Original designs preserved
One hopes that the building will be maintained and that the integrity of its original designs and materials will be preserved. It was refurbished around a decade ago by the architect Ashley de Vos. The De Soysa family members have a good understanding of its history and have photographs of the building in their possession, although they know less about its architectural significance.
Colonial architecture is often viewed with hostility as representing colonial oppression and so we tend to tear down these old houses. The pressures of urban development aid us in this process. But they are indicative of social sensibilities of that period, and local labor built them with inter-ethnic collaboration, as with the example of Regina Walawwa. More recently, colonial buildings have been converted into stage sets in the beautification programs of the city. While this revives the architecture, and prolongs their lifespan, it tends to flatten its history into a backdrop for commercialization. We need to understand their relevance through uncovering histories both good and bad, stated Pieris.

Raza, Moor keep Zimbabwe hopes alive against Windies
Bulawayo: An unbroken partnership of 94 between Sikandar Raza and Peter Moor ensured that Zimbabwe lived to fight another day in the second Test after the West Indies delivered some heavy blows at Queens Sports Club on Wednesday.
Raza and Moor came together with Zimbabwe reeling on 46 for four in their second innings, still needing 76 runs to make the West Indies bat again.
By the close of the fourth day they had carried the home side to 140 for four to claim an 18-run lead, with Raza adding his second half-century in a match where he has also claimed a five-wicket haul.
The partnership kept Zimbabwes slim hopes of winning the Test and squaring the two-match series alive, with 92 overs due to be bowled on the final day.
Weve got to get through a session and get ourselves into a position where we can maybe consider giving them a target, Zimbabwe coach Heath Streak said.
But its very tough, especially with the deficit weve had to make up, and with the pitch being so slow.
Zimbabwes chances of ending a 10-match losing streak in Tests were badly dented by a 212-run partnership between Shane Dowrich and Jason Holder -- a record for the eighth wicket for the West Indies.
The pair had come together on the third afternoon with the West Indies on 230 for seven, still trailing by 76 runs, and their stand allowed the visitors to eventually post 448 all out on the fourth morning.
Dowrichs 103 was his first century in Test cricket, while Holders 110 was his second.
Shane has not had the best time in the recent past and was in need of a score, so it was good to be out there with him, said Holder.
We were under pressure with the Zimbabweans bowling well. We really needed a partnership to get back in the game and it was down to me and Shane to put one up.
Holder enjoyed some fortune, surviving a plumb lbw shout when he was on 11 as well as being dropped on 78, leaving Zimbabwe to rue their missed opportunities.
They batted really well and put us under pressure, and we didnt help ourselves with a few dropped catches, said Streak.
Weve got ourselves to blame for giving them that lead, but weve just got to deal with where were at now.
After spending 178 overs in the field, Zimbabwes punch-drunk top order were easily knocked over as Kemar Roach grabbed two wickets in his opening spell.
But Raza made an unbeaten 58 and Moor batted 152 deliveries for his 39 not out to ensure that the series, which the West Indies lead 1-0, will go into a final

Red tape diverts Calamanders Rs 2 bn investment to UK
Calamander Group, Unawatuna will invest Rs 2 billion in United Kingdom to build a 58 room beachfront star class hotel.
Chairman and founder of The Calamander Group Roman Scott, told Daily News Business that he had initially planned to invest this amount in Sri Lanka but was forced to take it out due to the severe red tape he had to encounter in Sri Lanka.
I was planning to build a four star hotel investing Rs 2 billion but then to my dismay found that the approval process for land clearance, environment and provincial council approvals was going to take more than one year and decided to take it to UK.
The Chairman said he was also taken aback seeing the huge tax imposed on the hotel sector in Sri Lanka including VAT, TDL plus high electricity tariffs and analyzed that his investment would be more productive in UK.
Scott who also operates the Coffee Bean outlets and the re-launched Calamander Unawatuna Beach after his takeover said that in contrast when he indicated his keenness to invest in North Yorkshire, the mayor there made an appointment with him and wanted to know how he could help the investor in his constituency. This is how they (UK) welcomed me with the kind words, HOW CAN I HELP YOU SIR
This is how they treat foreign investors and lay the red carpet to them and Sri Lankan authorities at BOI and other departments should take a leaf from them and be investor friendly or Sri Lankan would never achieve the US $ 5 billion FDI target and would end up with less than US $ one billion.
Scott also said that he was surprise and dismayed in the manner in which the national carrier was not supporting the tourism industry. Firstly they (SriLankan) should never have pulled out from Europe (Frankfurt, Paris and Rome) and I think their inbound airfare is not at all competitive.
He also lashed out at the informal sector and said that they were killing the industry. For instance there were over 200 unclassified hotels in Unawatuna who are all listed in severs global booking websites and they are selling rooms starting from US$ 30 dollars. But unlike the registered hoteliers they dont pay a single cent as tax and maintain minimum standers. However in contrast even if our recycling plant brakes down even for single day we have to pay huge fines and hence we dont see a level playing field in the industry.
I also say that Sri Lankan tourism promotions overseas are horrible. Also the entry ticket fees at heritage and religious sites and parks are highly overpriced and are unfairly squeezing the tourist, he said.

SAITM would be a non-profit institution, Rajitha reiterates
Co-Cabinet Spokesman Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said the SAITM would not be abolished or nationalized. However, it will function as a non-profit institution approved by the Higher Education Ministry.
He made this observation at the weekly Cabinet media briefing held yesterday at the Government Information Department.
Minister Senaratne said the SAITM will function as a non-profit institution which means that the surplus revenues of this institution will be used only for the improvement of the institution without distributing it to the organization's shareholders.
Responding to a journalist who inquired about Dr. Neville Fernandos response to the governments decision, the Minister said Dr. Neville Fernando has already agreed to this decision.
When a journalist asked whether any decision has been taken to transfer the SAITM to the SLIIT, Minister Senaratne said not only the SLIIT, but also some other educational institutions have shown willingness to take the SAITM under them.
Responding to a query by a journalist who claimed that the Government Medical Officers Association does not agree to the governments decision on the SAITM completely, the Minister said if the GMOA does not agree with the governments decision, they should suggest their own solution for the SAITM issue.

Shaping up life
The Sri Lankan National Cadet Corps which has a history of more than 100 years has produced youth of sterling character. The cadets develop personalities similar to those of a perfect soldier. They are brave, tough, resilient and resourceful and have been trained to face challenges, obstacles and adversity. They are some of the finest youth emerging in Sri Lanka, and have the fiber and qualities demanded by the 21st century in order to survive and succeed. They are fighters. Indeed the motto of the National Cadet Corps of Sri Lanka is Never be unprepared
Out of over numerous senior boy cadet platoons in the island, the Centenary Hermann Loos Challenge Trophy, was awarded to the all island overall champion boy cadet platoon of the year 2017 - De Mazoned College Kandana.
The cadet camp in Rantambe had duration of ten days featuring the crme de la crme of talent in Sri Lankan Cadetting. There was a representation of Cadets from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and the Maldives at this momentous occasion.
Foreign cadets
The Cadets from these countries witnessed the caliber of our armed forces at the awarding of the Hermann Loos Trophy where our armed forces displayed their prowess in a series of exercises that splendidly coloured up the morning.
Shivi Badyal
State Minister of Defence, Ruwan Wijewardene who was the Chief Guest praised the Cadet Corp for molding the future generation of Sri Lanka. The State minister called it a unique experience in a lifetime.
I wish to congratulate the cadets taking part in this event and extend my warmest wishes to the officers who trained these cadets. One hundred years is a great milestone. No doubt these young cadets will provide the leadership required to take our country forwards. The country is in their hands and the future of our country is secure.
They will take up key leadership positions in this country. The discipline and practical lessons they learn will enable them to function efficiently and swiftly. They will certainly render a great service to the country, said Wijewardene.
Wijewardene also stated that the Sri Lankan government is every ready to assist the youth of this country which is a great resource. The youth must be disciplined and ever ready to act on behalf of the country. It was the late John. F. Kennedy that said  And so my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.
The youth must be trained to face hardships with determination and with courage.
Winners of the trophy De Mazoned College Kandana
They need to be dedicated and disciplined. The government of this country has recognized the importance of the Sri Lankan National Cadet Corps and is keen on its progression. We must be ever ready as Sri Lankans to be victorious and triumphant. We have won a brutal war and no doubt the National Cadet Corps has had a hand in producing competent officers.
This curriculum is comprehensive. We are indebted to these officers, explained Wijewardene. The Minister used this occasion to thanks all those who fought for the freedom of our country. The minister also said that the education of students must not be limited only to exams, classwork and tuition.
Extra-curricular activities are also needed. We live in a tuition oriented culture where the children are deprived of physical activities that have a detrimental impact on their personality development. Cadetting is an excellent way to develop the mind and body which brings to ones mind an old Latin quote: Mens Sana in Corpore sano  a Healthy Mind in a Healthy Body
The field of sports inculcates life lessons in these students that cannot be taught in the classroom. The development of the mind and the body is essential. The child needs to be exposed to a variety of experiences. The mental health if a child is an investment for the future. Its significance must be understood. The child learns how to overcome problems, stated Wijewardene.
Finally the Minister pointed out that friendships developed during the camp are priceless and the camp has no doubt been a success. The Minister also addressed the foreign cadets who were present that day and thanked them for being a part of the Centenary Hermann Loos trophy. I hope this has been a great experience for all of you. Cadetting is about building up the character and leadership of young people. I hope all of you will become fine leaders of the country you represent. Undoubtedly you will shape the future of the country you represent, Minister added.
Daily News also spoke to Senior Under Officer of the Indian National Cadet Corps Shivi Badyal who called it a great honour to be a cadet. Badyal who was present at the ceremony showed a lot of charisma which is due to her officer training. She has become a confident young woman of the 21st century ready to serve her motherland. She shared her views on what it means to be a cadet.
Definitely I am thinking of joining the army after I pass out. I am definitely ready to fight if necessary for my country. My mother initially made me join the Cadet Corps and I do not regret the decision. Sri Lanka is such a beautiful country and I am privileged to be here. Since our stay in Sri Lanka we have had a varied cultural experiences. I am proud to be a cadet, said Badyal.

Digital marketing is not just a trend but a requirement in the current business sphere. The newest trend in digital marketing which is mobile marketing has fast gained momentum. The mobile phone being the most utilized device among people has given light to this trend which is very user-friendly and hassle free," he said.
SLIM Vice President Pradeep Edward who is the Director/CEO of GAP Holdings mentioned that SLIM introduced the CDM programme after a thorough research.
"People with the knowhow on digital marketing, champion the current digital marketing sphere. The best marketing practitioners who hold senior positions in the corporate sector lecture at the SLIM- CDM programme. They will share industry experiences with students and their lectures will shed light on both local and international contexts", he said. He also drew attention to the wide spectrum of activities SLIM students are exposed to, beyond marketing studies.
"The SLIM Students' Council offers SLIM members networking opportunities with peers and lecturers and to take part in national level events conducted by SLIM such as SLIM-NASCO, Brand Excellence, People's Award, Marketers' Nite, the EFFIE Awards and SLIM Toastmasters," he said.
SLIM CEO/Executive Director Sanath Senanayake opined that the SLIM - CDM course content, syllabus, and textbooks were made to cater to current industry requirements. He was of the view that "Digital Marketing helps marketers respond to and initiate dynamic customer interactions. The SLIM - CDM programme has the right blend of group case study and online examination. SLIM is flexible to adapt to industry requirements and introduces innovative courses such as CDM from time to time. SLIM is dedicated to produce marketers who could rub shoulders with professionals in any competitive environment." Credible and innovative courses and training programmes and affordable prices of SLIM have made students, the marketing fraternity and the corporate sector in Sri Lanka perceive SLIM as an invaluable mentoring entity for over four decades.

Supreme Court rules Geetha unqualified to serve as MP

A Supreme Court five-judge-bench headed by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep today unanimously ruled that Galle district parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe is not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament since she holds dual citizenship.
The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal judgment datedMay 3and its order in the nature of writ of Quo Warranto declaring that Galle District MP Geetha Kumarasinghe is disqualified to be a member of parliament and thus not entitled to hold office as a Member of Parliament.
Accordingly, the appeal filed by Geetha Kumarasinghe was dismissed with cost. The registrar of Supreme Court was directed that this order be sent to the Secretary General of Parliament forthwith.
This judgment was delivered by Supreme Court Judge Sisira de Abrew, who was a member of five-judge-Bench which heard the appeal.
This judgment had been approved by four other judges Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Buwaneka Aluwihare, Justice Sisira de Abrew, Justice Anil Goonaratne and Justice Nalin Perera.
When I consider the Article 91(1) (d) (xiii) of the Constitution, I hold that if a candidate in a Parliament Election is a citizen of Sri Lanka and any other country on the day of parliament election or on the day of taking oaths as Member of Parliament (MP), he cannot be considered as MP and that office of such a person as a MP is nullified, Justice Abrew observed.
After taking oaths as a MP, if he becomes a citizen of any other country or continues to be a citizen of any other country, he too cannot be considered as a MP and that office of such a person as a Member of Parliament is nullified Justice Abrew added.
I have earlier held that Geetha Kumarasinghe was not qualified to be elected as a MP on August 17, 2015 that she was not qualified to take oaths as MP on September 1, 2015. Thus, a writ of Quo Warranto is available to oust her from MP position. The Supreme Court affirms the Court of Appeal judgment and dismisses the appeal with cost, he said.
Delivering its judgment on the writ petition filed by five residents of Galle district, the Court of Appeal onMarch 3held that in terms of Article 91(1) (d) (xiii) of the Constitution, Geetha Kumarasinghe is not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament since she holds dual citizenship in Switzerland and Sri Lanka.
Subsequently, MP Geetha Kumarasinghe filed an Appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the Court of Appeal judgment.
On May 15, a divided three-judge-Supreme Court bench had granted special leave to appeal with the petition filed by Kumarasinghe.
At a previous occasion, the Supreme Court allowed former Minister Piyasena Gamage to intervene into the appeal filed by Galle district parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe.
In his petition, former MP Piyasena Gamage observed that Interim Order granted to Geetha Kumarasinghe should be set aside or vacated as the intervenient petition had not been named as a respondent.
The Chief Justice had nominated a fuller bench comprising five judges of the Supreme Court to hear an appeal filed by Galle district parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe.
In this appeal petition, Geetha Kumarasinghe had cited N.W.E. Buwaneka of Beddegama, J.K. Amarawardhana of Yatalamatta, A.C. Gunasekara of Unawatuna, J.K. Wijesinghe of Ambalangoda and H.L.Prasanna Deepthilal of Galle, Controller General of Immigration and Emigration, the Secretary General of Parliament and several others as respondents.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva with counsel Sugath Caldera appeared for MP Geetha Kumarasinghe. Presidents Counsel J. C. Weliamuna PC, Faiz Musthapha PC, Chandaka Jayasundara PC and Pulasthi Rupasinghe appeared on behalf of the respondents.

## Title: TEA brews toxic blend for its own survival

TEA brews toxic blend for its own survival
At its recent 18th Annual General Meeting, the Tea Exporters Association (TEA), renewed its strident demand for liberalization of the tea industry, ostensibly to modernize and end the downfall of the industry and seemingly driven by a laudably altruistic motive.
In reality, it was once again a pathetic plea for State patronage for the importation of black tea from other producer countries, in order to resuscitate the flagging fortunes of unenterprising exporters / TRADERS through the injection of cheap tea in to their blends.
Before the TEA came into being 18 years ago, all industry interests were represented by the Ceylon Tea Traders Association (CTTA), with proportional representation from the trading segment, the producers-planters and brokers. It was an inclusive platform which facilitated the discussion of sectoral interests and problems, but without divorcing itself from the common objective of ensuring the wellbeing of the industry. At the outset, one must bear in mind that the TEA is promoting only its personal interest and objective, irrespective of the potential toxic fallout in relation to the industry in general. This is clearly demonstrated by the TEA call for State sanction to isolate itself from the industry proper, by being placed under the Trade Ministry.
The multi-faceted tea industry in Sri Lanka represents the plantation worker, the small holder, the corporate plantation owner, the private factory owner, and a myriad ancillary service providers. The exporter is only one link at the end of a long chain and not the most important. The producer segment represents, conservatively, at least 2 million people, equivalent to 10% of the population of the country; those at the bottom end of the income ladder whos daily bread depends on the overall health of the industry.
Any damage to the industry arising from an initiative designed to benefit a disaffected minority group, will irreparably hurt the lives of this larger segment. Any proposal with potential for a wide-ranging impact on the industry must consider the above aspect which is of genuine national importance and relevance, unlike the parochial nature of the TEAs woes.
Permit me to address the many positions articulated by the TEA, as reported in a local daily of 23/10/2017.
The TEA claims that the industry has become  highly politicized and a national burden. Surely, the reality is that the political aspect of the industry was removed with its total re-privatization in 1992, as it was pre-1977. In fact, the State relieved itself of a national burden.
Therefore, the TEA claim of politicization is contradictory, lacks validation and unsupported, but yet a recurrent refrain in the articulation of TEA grievances. The government and the relevant ministries and entities are mandated to act in the interests of the industry in its totality, and the millions it supports. That responsibility cannot be sublimated to provide a crutch to a small group of faltering commercial adventurers. What the TEA is now seeking is political patronage in order to bolster its declining fortunes.
The TEA claims that high controls close opportunities for foreign investments, opportunities for local firms to expand. The one controlled aspect of the local industry is the restriction on importation of cheap tea, when a product of similar configuration is produced in large volumes in this country. The arithmetic of cheap imports is ridiculously simple, irrespective of the item under consideration. A cheaper imported substitute or equivalent will immediately devalue the local product or render it unsellable. To cite one recent example, locally produced pepper which was selling at Rs 1300/kilo just one year ago has now declined to Rs 700/kilo as a consequence of cheap imports in to the country. The resultant impact on the local pepper industry does not need further elaboration.
As seen in Graph I, the all auction average price of tea varied from USD 2.65 in 2012 to USD 2.40 in 2015.
Graph II demonstrates the average FOB price during the same period (2012-2015) in respect of the major producer-exporters. The Sri Lanka FOB price of USD 4.66 is USD 1.54 more than India and USD 2.00 more than that of Kenya, the most serious competitor to Sri Lankan tea in the global market. The Sri Lanka price is also close upon USD 2.0 more than the highest global auction average for the same period.
The impact of cheap imports, irrespective of source, will immediately diminish the Colombo auction prices proportionately and compel the local producer to sell well below COP, at unimaginably destructive consequences to the millions of dependents of the industry, particularly at rural and plantation level, whilst resurrecting and enriching a small segment of exporters/TRADERS. The socioeconomic consequences of diminished earnings of a substantial segment of the population, currently existing just above subsistence level, would then become the actual national burden that the TEA is so glibly asserting. In essence, what the TEA is proposing as a strategy to overcome a purely sectoral problem, is to squander foreign exchange on cheaper imports, thus diminishing the local auction price and the FOB price, which will automatically result in the diminution of foreign exchange earnings for the country from the export of tea. The national foreign exchange earnings can be grown only by increasing the export price and not by reducing it, as proposed by the TEA.
The TEA believes that with liberalization Sri Lanka has the potential to become a $5 billion industry. Given that exporting at USD 4.66 we make $1.5 billion annually, the claim that it can be grown to USD 5 billion by selling cheap defies all economic, financial and statistical logic.
As for State protection for an important national product, which defines and brands the country globally, one need not look further than France, where the production style, region of manufacture and nomenclature of Champagne is rigidly governed by law and the importation of any equivalent product prohibited. It is guarded by an internationally enforceable covenant which prevents a similar product in any other country being marketed as  Champagne.
Historically, the tea industry in Sri Lanka has been exploited by the foreign/multinational exporter, starting with the British who gave birth to the industry. For decades we have submissively supplied bulk tea to multinationals, who have added value to our product elsewhere and enriched themselves whilst conceding a mere pittance to the dependents of the local industry. Having first captured other markets on the brand uniqueness of Ceylon Tea, these entrepreneurs then reduced the "Ceylon" tea component in their blends with cheaper substitutes from other destinations and enlarged their profits. What the TEA is proposing is extending that same servile service to masters who have no affiliation or loyalty to the country of origin, at potentially debilitating consequences to this country.
For example, when the dismantling of the Soviet Republic provided an excellent opportunity for Sri Lankan exporters to develop local brands for international marketing, most of our exporters chose the easier, well-travelled route and became packers for new entrants to the Russian market. The result was that in just a few years Russians expanded markets on the strength of Ceylon Tea, but gradually reducing their cost and increasing profit by substituting the Ceylon tea component with cheaper imports from elsewhere.
The TEA, by its own statements, continues to contradict their rationale for the liberalization of imports. On the one hand, it criticizes the government for not advertising Ceylon Tea, using a dual promotion strategy - unspecified - similar to what other countries and products have done. ..Ceylon Tea is a part of a brand concept like Scotch Whisky. This is what we want the Government to do with the Rs. 7 Billion fund.
If the uniqueness of Ceylon Tea is comparable to the exclusivity proposition of Scotch Whisky, then why propose its dilution with cheap additives In fact, does a cheap, diluted product warrant an expensive marketing campaign Does the Scottish "Single Malt" producer dilute and cheapen his product with low-priced imported components A successful branding strategy founded on a Unique Selling Point to capture a market, is diametrically opposed to the concept of cost reduction with a cheap component, and are two mutually exclusive propositions. Demonstrating another example of confused thinking, the TEA dismisses the Pure Ceylon Tea concept, commenting that it .accounts for less than 10% of the annual tea export volume, and that the representative brands are unable to drive the tea industry to achieve expected growth..
In fact, that statement represents the mindset of the timid and unenterprising exporter and is the very reason why a few exporters sell comfortably at USD 10 per kg, FOB, whilst the other struggles for survival at USD 3 per kg. The reality is that it is the locally owned brands, exporting exclusively Pure Ceylon Tea, which are the flag-bearers for the national product, on the global stage.
The TEA speaks of the inability of certain exporters to cater to specific markets due to the unavailability of suitable types of tea locally. This country produces a greater variety of grades of black tea than possibly any other country whilst the government permits the importation of Darjeelings, Green Tea and other speciality types, which are not typical products of our industry. What other type of tea would the TEA have in mind for import If it is CTC tea, we are free to increase production volumes locally if there is a corresponding increase in the external demand for it.
The TEA has cited, not for the first time, the garment industry as an example of the success of liberalization. The garment industry is different from the tea industry as chalk is from cheese. In the apparel sector, 90% of the raw material is imported and value addition at our end is in terms of skill and sweat. It bears no comparison with the tea industry, in which literally every constituent component is locally produced.
The two attached graphs clearly demonstrate that international and local firms moving out of Sri Lanka in search of lower cost tea will not have even a minimal impact on the local FOB price or auction levels. That is exactly what those members of the TEA who are seeking a cheaper source should do, without strategizing to cheapen this source.
Bill Gorman, speaking at the recently concluded 150th year Tea Anniversary celebrations, referred to the race to the bottom now taking place in the UK tea market, in which the consumer is compelled to accept low quality tea shorn of its beneficial features. What the TEA proposes is a similar downward journey for Ceylon Tea, at its very source.
Sri Lanka produces approximately 330 mn kg tea per year and every kilo is sold at the highest prices in the world, a value dictated by the uniqueness of Ceylon Tea. To dilute that advantage by the uncritical emulation of the highly efficient, volume driven strategies of multinational giants who rely on cheap, multi-origin packs, is a sure recipe for disaster. Selling cheap one can only scramble at the bottom end for an uncertain survival. The TEA call for liberalization of imports is driven by the same sense of insecurity generated by the rapidly diminishing profit margins of the proponents.
The TEA proposes to sacrifice every advantage Pure Ceylon Tea has, in favour of immediate personal survival and gains that are certain to be short-term, whilst the damage caused to the local industry will be permanent and irreparable. Given the importance of the tea industry to a significant proportion of the population of this country, that would be an act of treason.
The exploitative thrust of the Western based multinational packer/marketer of a third world product is best exemplified by coffee. For every plastic cup of coffee sold for USD 3-4, in affluent societies, the farmer in Africa gets 5 cents. From a kilogram of coffee beans sold at USD 2.75, 110 cups can be brewed, translating to a profit margin of over USD 300 for those in between the poor farmer and the rich consumer. That mirrors the story of tea as well and the proposal of the TEA would be to contribute to that unacceptable socioeconomic disequilibrium.
Internally, our tea industry is confronted by rising costs and stagnant productivity and, externally, by the of diminution of Sri Lanka tea in multinational brands, expanding production in other growing countries, the steadily growing gap between global production and consumption, further compounded by the threat to tea, globally, posed by competing beverages. In the face of these multiple challenges, unless all stakeholders of the industry unite and establish a commonality of purpose within, the industry will fail in its totality. Isolating oneself from the group and seeking an individual solution will, at best, provide a temporary and marginal gain. Division means eventual disintegration whilst in unity there is strength.
In the course of a 66-year involvement in the tea industry, I have invested in its every segment - plantations, brokerage and value added exports, a commitment which extends from the bush to the supermarket shelf. Dilmah, the only fully Sri Lankan owned international brand, owes its position of international preeminence to the concept of Pure Ceylon Tea. That concept will be destroyed if the TEA proposal to import tea is sanctioned.
The consequences to the industry in its totality, particularly the dependent rural and plantation economies, as explained in this writing, will be devastating. Other principled exporters will also suffer a similar fate and, as a citizen and an individual who has dedicated a life time to tea, I consider it my duty to do everything within my capacity to prevent the dismantling of this industry.

UNP, dedicated to empowering women
We are building a strong economy enabling us to establish a better nation for all our people. Progressive social reform and the empowerment of women are the right way forward and come about because we have created the investment from the proceeds of growth. I look forward with optimism to a better future for all Sri Lankans - men, women and children.
The economy is central to everything we do and it is only with the UNP that Sri Lankas economy will be made stronger to improve the lives of ordinary Sri Lankans.
We have doubled Samurdhi payments to low income families so that they have more money in their pockets than under the previous regime, which only cared about its own pockets. These families are also benefitting from the actions the UNP has taken to reduce the cost of goods like fuel and medicine. For the first time, pregnant women and the elderly are receiving real support. As we continue to strengthen our economy, we will continue to increase support to people who were neglected and forgotten under the previous regime.
Womens matters
Sri Lankas steps to achieve gender equality have comprised reforms to domestic laws and the integration of gender-related priorities into government action plans. Our government is currently updating a national action plan on women and has a dedicated ministry on womens matters.
We take the promotion and protection of the rights of women very seriously, remaining firm in a commitment to strive continuously and with diligence to achieve gender equality and womens empowerment.
The Sri Lankan Government is currently in the process of drafting a new Constitution, aiming to include womens rights in the Fundamental Rights Chapter. Government policies are currently being formulated on violence against women, and the capacity-building of police and the judiciary in this regard.
Six new shelters have been set up in various locations for the protection of survivors of violence. A digital database system has also been developed for the collection of gender-based violence data with support from the police and other stakeholders.
Employment opportunities
The National Framework for Women-headed Households (20172019) has been introduced, especially to improve the socio-economic situation of women affected by conflict. Programmes are in place to support the economic empowerment of rural women and encourage girls to enter technological fields to improve employment opportunities. For promoting womens political participation, a 25 per cent quota has been allocated for women in local government bodies, while Cabinet approval is being sought to provide 30 per cent nominations for females at the Provincial Council elections.
Our government is committed to ensuring that ordinary families, vulnerable people and poor communities in our society receive the necessary support. Nutritious food worth Rs 2,000 per month is now provided to mothers during the last 6 months of pregnancy and for the first 4 months after delivery.
We want to improve the lives of all our citizens and we want to empower our women. Our government has a track record to be proud of in enhancing gender equality and there is still more to do. We are building a strong economy and using the proceeds to benefit women who contribute so much to Sri Lankan life.

VCs PLEASED WITH SAITM SOLUTION
*Appeal to students to return to lectures*Presidential Committee decision fair
The Committee of Vice Chancellors have announced that they are pleased with the solution put forward by the Presidential Committee appointed to resolve the much fraught South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) issue.
Speaking to the Daily News, Prof Ranjith Wijewardana, Chairman of the CVCD said that they were collectively pleased with the new proposals that have been put forward and were of the opinion that the decision by the committee is fair to all parties involved.
Our main concern is students who are abstaining from attending lecturers, he said.
We urge them to return to their studies and continue their clinical training as theyve been doing so in the past.
Since a positive solution has been created for all medical students of State universities to continue their education and clinical training, we, the Vice Chancellors, insist on them to engage in their academic work with immediate effect, the statement by the CVCD read.
Ironically, their statement comes in the wake of a resumption of protests by the Medical Faculty Students Action committee against SAITM. Since yesterday the students have commenced a satyagraha outside the National Hospital in Colombo.
Convener, Ryan Jayalath stated that their satyagraha will be held throughout the day and warned that similar protests would take place on a district basis. Their Satyagraha coincides with the hunger strike, which is to be launched by the Medical Faculty Students Parents Association.
When asked if there would be repercussions on students who continued to abstain from lectures and protest, Prof. Wijewardana added that such action is yet to be seen. Prof.Wijewardana did not declare that there wont be any action but stated that it was to be discussed.
Meanwhile Prof. Ranil Fernando, President of the Kelaniya University Faculty of Medicine Teachers Association welcomed the proposals by the committee adding that it is a positive step towards solving the crisis faced by medical education in this country.
In their statement, they have urged students to return to their studies immediately.
The Government Medical Officers Association says it is not in agreement with the content of the notification issued by Dr. Neville Fernando pertaining to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine.
The GMOA however has expressed reservations over the proposals put forward, citing that they need to meet with the President to clarify some of the suggestions.
Dr.Haritha Aluthge said it is commendable the Government decided to abolish SAITM, remove the ownership of SAITM from its current owner and his family and to legalise the minimum standards of medical education, according to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) document. They have however offered their support on certain conditions.
He said he was confused about the proposed new institution to be set up after abolishing SAITM.
Whatever new institution must obtain the compliance certificate from the SLMC. This new institution should be scrutinised by a state body. The Government/State Policy mentioned in the Governments statement is not clear at all, he said.
An Interim Committee should be appointed under the SLMC, immediately, to look into the issue of current students in SAITM. The countrys law should be implemented against the current SAITM owner for all grave offences committed by him so far, he added.

Voice behind the visuals
If you are a fan of Sinhala cinema, no doubt you would be able to recall the timeless tunes of Mage Sihina Madure of Jayantha Chandrasiris magnum opus Samanala Sandwaniya (Butterfly Symphony) with ease. The voice behind this soul stirring song is little know though the song has become timeless and is still listened to a countless number of times. That voice belongs to 27 year old Shammika Amani from Polonnaruwa. Apart from echoing your sentiments over the sound waves the past couple of years with the heart-piercing Mage Sihina Madure, Shammika has rendered her voice to several other productions: one teledrama and one film.
She did the theme song and another song for the film titled Aakarsha which will be screening in the future. She also crooned to the tunes of the Sith Ahasa teledrama which had already been telecast on the mini screen. She was also a support vocalist for a number in Sujeewa Gunaratnes film Kaala which is currently screening in the CEL circuit these days. These are romantic songs which set them poles apart from her debut - a heart wrenching number.
Shammika in a visual from her song Kavikari Mamai
Mage Sihina Madure was my first experience at background singing. I learnt music under music director Dharshana Dissanayake. Director Jayantha Chandrasiri and team were searching for a suitable voice for the song and Dissanayake said that I fitted the bill, Shammika said.
One of the most frequent feedbacks she has gotten for her contribution was that though she is a novice to the field, she had sung the song like a professional. Many could not believe that this beaming young lady had given voice to the tearful lass in the visuals.
The background vocals are recorded before the visuals. However both Chandrasiri and Dissanayake related the emotions and atmosphere of the scenes to me. They also trained me on how singing background vocals differ from singing a tune on a stage. It took some work but I managed to live up to their expectations, she enthused adding that the key to a successful take is that the background vocalist too needs to enjoy the song while voicing it.
The talented youth is an old girl of Weerapura Kanishta Vidyalaya and Royal Central College, Polonnaruwa. She said that her parents noted her flair for singing at an early age.
They too can sing well and they both loved the arts. So they encouraged me to learn music. Dissanayake was a guest at a musical concert which was held at our school. He heard me singing at that event. I had just finished my G C E Advanced Levels then, she recalled adding that she had done eastern music as a subject in school.
She trained under her aunt Ayesha Kumari Somasekara and her school music teacher Sunethra Priyanthi. She had played the violin and sitar at school. Dissanayake taught her how to become a professional vocalist and trained her on background vocals.
The music and art field is very competitive. I am glad I got the opportunity to show my colours in the field.
She notes that Chandrasiri has been one of her favourite filmmakers from childhood.
I loved Dandubasnamanaya and Guerilla Marketing. So many people have enjoyed his productions because they are of high quality. He is one of the giants in the field and to debut in one of his productions as a background vocalist is a dream come true for any budding young vocalist. Not only was I over the moon about the offer but I felt a slight pride about my talent as well. I was motivated to do my best for the project, she explained the thoughts which ran through her mind after hearing that she has been selected to be a part of Samanala Sandwaniya.
Shammikas parents are teachers. Her father, Pragna Keerthi, is a sports teacher while her mother, Priyanthi Marasinghe, teaches agriculture. Her brother, Sehan Ayantha, acted in Samanala Sandwaniya as a friend of the protagonist. Therefore she had mostly been in the company of her brother, Sachini Nisansala and Soorya Dayaruwan, the actor who portrayed the childhood stages of Vadisha, the protagonist of the tale.
We had fun on the sets and we all excelled due to the film. Soorya is well known today and my talents too came into the limelight due to the movie, she expressed adding that the song still takes her back to the past.
Shammika is employed at the Mahaweli Authority as a Unit Manager.
I cannot engage in background singing full time due to my profession but if a good opportunity arises I make it a point to come to Colombo and take part in the project.
This is because it has become a passion for me. You can wrap up a song for a movie or teledrama in one day. I also get a lot of support from my work place to take part in such events, she said.
Her favourite vocalists are Indian playback singer Shreya Ghoshal, Nanda Malini, Uresha Ravihari, and Sujatha Attanayake.
Shammika notes that the most valuable advice she had gotten in the field was to be humble and how to learn to work with others.
You need to do justice to a song as well as work quickly.
There is no time to dally around as things have to be wrapped up as quick as possible so that the team can focus on the next task at hand. Filmmaking is an expensive chore so if you manage to pull off your part on the first take, then you would be saving a lot of money and time, she explained adding that these words of wisdom had been given to her by Chandrasiri and Dissanayake.
Shammika noted that she had learnt acting when she was young and she had given life to some characters in school plays. If she is offered an opportunity to act, she is willing to take on that challenge as well.
Her message to budding young vocalists is to be modest and friendly with everyone in the field.
Do not vary your commitment according to the size of the project. Enjoy your work while letting others enjoy the outcome. This is a true and tested success formula, she advised.

He was addressing a meeting following the distribution of jayabhoomi ownership deeds at Angunakolapelessa.
The minster said that this project will become the countrys main irrigation project and that this will be a solution to the burning problem of scarcity of water in the Hambantota district. This project will also be a boon to foreign and local investors who plan to launch industrial ventures.
The people in the district knew how the lands in the district were distributed. Henchmen of the previous regime and the then politicians were the owners of State lands in the Hambantota district. There are thousands of families in the district without a shelter, but politicians never listened to their grievances, the minister added.
The minister said that industrial and service projects would provide thousands of jobs to unemployed youths in the district with a reasonable salary. Most of the families within the Mahaweli Authority area remained without ownership deeds for decades, but today, their expectations have been fulfilled.

People in Nawalapitiya made the UNP victorious at the last general elections with the fervent hope of ensuring development and progress in their electorate.
After laying the necessary groundwork during the last two years, the Yahapalana government has fulfilled their expectations by launching development work along with the food production drive and the results of this endeavour will be seen during the next three years, Kandy District UNP Parliamentarian Ananda Aluthgamage said.
He was addressing a meeting after laying the foundation stone for a proposed development project at Kurunduwatta, recently.
He said he laid foundation stones for five projects to be undertaken at a cost of Rs. 20 million provided by the Home Affairs Ministry on the initiative of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
It would include the development of the Telihunne-Kadegedara and Raja Ela roads development of the Malwattagama Nila Piyasa and the Malwatte water supply project.
He said the roads he built earlier in his capacity as Pradesheeya Sabha Chairman from 1994 had gone to utter neglect causing inconvenience to people in the area. Since his crossover from the SLFP to the UNP, the party had won two elections held subsequently.
He said a project costing Rs 1.5 million would be launched to provide pipe-borne water supplies to Galpaya Grama Niladhari division.
He said steps would also be taken to provide pipe-borne water to all needy areas in Ganga Ihala division in the near future.

Kapil Devs message to Sri Lankas cricketers:
Believe in yourself theres  no one better than you
Indias 1983 World Cup winning captain Kapil Dev who was the guest of honour at the Dialog Cricket Awards 2017 held at the Waters Edge on Tuesday told the cricketers representing Sri Lanka to believe in themselves because it was that belief that enabled them to win the World Cup in 1996.
In a glitzy night attended by distinguished members of the cricketing fraternity where Rangana Herath was crowned the Dialog Cricketer of the Year and Asela Gunaratne (4) and Chamari Atapattu (5) bagged the highest number of awards in the mens and womens categories, Kapil said: I know you had a rough time recently and you are not playing well because great cricketers have just gone it is difficult, but thats how cricket goes. The young cricketers who are sitting on my left side who got lots of rewards they have a lot of responsibility. I can only say one thing to all the cricketers who are going to represent the country and who are playing for your country, make sure you believe in yourself. Respect your opponent but once you wear your countrys colours and you walk into the ground theres nobody better than you, you produce the result.
Ive seen your cricket growing from a very young age. I was very young when I started playing but thats the time you got recognition in international cricket and in such a short spell how well you people have done, Kapil continued.
Its not only because of the cricketer, its the affect of everybody, the passion of the people of your country, spectators, despite the first 15 years you were losing most of the matches, but the people used to come back to the ground and loved you with a passion they would like to see Sri Lanka cricket go up. Eventually you emerged one of the best teams in the world and that in such a small island you started doing wonders.
Why you did that was only one thing, during that period you started believing in yourself that you can win. Your captain (Arjuna) Ranatunga had given that belief to everybody that during our time we are not less than everybody we are better than everybody despite of your very simple life, very subdued, not very aggressive race by nature, but on the field the way you played the cricket it was hats off to everybody.
Kapil said that he did not want to follow in the footsteps of two other Asian cricket captains  Imran Khan and Arjuna Ranatunga who won the World Cup for their country and later turned to politics because he was not a great speaker.
When I started playing cricket if somebody says you come and talk I rather say I want to play, I cant talk. I am not a great speaker thats why I didnt join politics like both the captains Pakistan and Sri Lanka. They joined politics because they love talking, I am not, I dont like to talk too much, Kapil said.
Before I come here I talk to my teacher and said I have to go to Sri Lanka and I have to give a speech. He said you will have only seven minutes vocabulary of English so you cant talk more than seven minutes, your speech should not last that long.
While thanking Sri Lanka Cricket for inviting him Kapil said, Normally I dont come I am very shy to come out since I stopped playing cricket. I stay away as much as I can and hope to remember my good days thats gone and thats history. My memories start coming back what I did in Sri Lanka good and bad it was a wonderful time. Its a wonderful nation and wonderful people its not because I am here because I believe from my heart. I enjoyed playing here against you people and I made wonderful friends in this country.
You are going to come to India next week or so I just want to wish you all the luck but not better than my country, I have to be honest. I want to say go out and play the best cricket and let the best team win. I want you to play tough cricket, dont be overawed by any of the players. I know India is a large country and distractions are there but you have responsibility towards your country. At this stage when your team is not playing so well somebody has to stand up and take the lead, its not the captain its the team, its very important. I like to wish you all the best in the next month and a half. When you play cricket winner-loser is a separate thing, play cricket so that people will look up to you thats how cricket is played.
Referring to former Sri Lanka cricketer Aravinda de Silva who was present at the occasion Kapil said, Talking about Sri Lanka that man sitting there Aravinda de Silva has given me a lot of rough time and I cant forget Roy Dias who in my time was one of the finest batsmen Ive bowled to.
Whilst wishing the womens cricketers good luck Kapil said in a lighter vein, To the administrators of your country it is not easy when you dont have so much funds and your neighbour has a lot of funds. Get it from them, go and meet them and take it by hook or by crook it will be fun.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera who was the chief guest and Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala also spoke.

Amid International Outcry, Aung San Suu Kyi Travels to Troubled Western Myanmar

Myanmars de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi began a visit to the northern part of the countrys Rakhine State Thursday, her first tour of to the area since military violence sent more than half a million Rohingya Muslims fleeing across the border just over two months ago.
The long-awaited trip follows mounting international pressure on the Nobel Peace Prize laureate to stop brutal military operations launched in response to an attack by Rohingya insurgents on Aug. 25. Since that day, more than 607,000 mostly Muslim Rohingya refugees havefled to neighboring Bangladeshbearing bullet wounds and accounts of atrocities. The crisis has become a key challenge for Suu Kyis 18-month-old administration.
Suu Kyi, whose official title is state counsellor, has said little in the face of a crackdownlabelledethnic cleansing by the U.N. In a rarespeechat the end of September, she called into question why the refugees were even leaving the country. Her reticence has been hugely disappointing to many of her supporters in the West, who long championed the political prisoner-turned-politician as an icon of democratic principles and human rights.
Suu Kyi has rarely ventured to the restive, impoverished Rakhine State. She has previously said that any visit could exacerbate simmering communal tensions. Her belated visit appears timed to quell both international and domestic anxieties about the crisis, according to Khin Zaw Win, director of the Myanmar think tank Tampadipa Institute. I expect this long-overdue visit would reassure some of the local inhabitants who had fled, Khin Zaw Win tells TIME. Most importantly it should send a signal to the military that they have to ease off.
Thats easier said than done in a country where Suu Kyis government, which came to power through a landslide election win after decades of brutal military rule, shares power with its former oppressors. While Myanmar is transitioning toward democracy, its civilian leaders remain hostage to a military drafted constitution that grants veto power and control of key ministries to the Commander-in-Chief. Suu Kyis defenders argue that she is powerless to stop the military from carrying out its will.
Moreover, thedamage may well be done. Far more than half of the entire estimated Rohingya population has fled to Bangladesh, where they joined others who sought refuge from previous violence. About one million Rohingya now live in crowded and unsanitary camps along the border. Myanmar says it is willing to repatriate them, also the preferred solution for Bangladesh, but conditions are not appropriate until violence subsides and the group can be guaranteed citizenship. The Rohingya, with an estimated prior population of about 1.1 million within Myanmar before most of them fled, has been rendered mostly stateless and is considered one of the worlds most persecuted minorities.
Ultimately, like a lot of her governments policies on Rakhine State and conflict throughout Myanmar, its too little, too late, says David Mathieson, an independent analyst based in Yangon, and utterly lacking in the appropriate levels of concern of the gravity of the crisis.

Around 1,700 Kurunegala residents affected by dengue
Around 1,700 students, school teachers, infants and residents within the Kurunegala MC area are reported to be taking medical treatment at government hospitals.
Many students of leading schools within the Kurunegala urban area abstain from attending schools these days as they have fallen ill with dengue fever. A grade six female student of a leading school in Kurunegala too died of dengue, recently. Kurunegala MC Commissiner Pradeep Thilakaratne said that cleaning work is now being done within the MC area by utilizing its labour force.
The reason for the spread of mosquito-breeding is that many schools are having construction sites within the school premises, where many pits are found filled with rain water. Dr. Indika Wickramasinghe, who is in charge of the Dengue Control Unit of the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital, said many students and teachers are now undergoing medical treatment for dengue.

Asela, Kusal overlooked for Test series against India
Batting all-rounder Asela Gunaratne and wicket-keeper/batsman Kusal Perera have been left out of the 15-member Sri Lanka Test squad picked for the three-Tests against India starting at Eden Gardens, Kolkata on November 16 due to match fitness.
The Lankan squad was picked yesterday and has been sent for ratification by the Minister of Sports.
Angelo Mathews, Asela Gunaratne and Kusal Perera all passed the yoyo and skinfold tests but as Asela and Kusal were short of match fitness we did not select them, said chairman of selectors Graeme Labrooy.
They will probably be considered for the one-day series that starts on December 10 as they will be able to play in the Under 23 tournament that is due to commence shortly and prove their match fitness, he said.
Each team in the Under 23 tournament is able to field at least five senior players in their side.
Perera has not played any cricket since the ICC Champions trophy in June where he picked up a hamstring injury while guiding Sri Lanka to a stunning seven-wicket over India at the Oval with an innings of 47 before retiring hurt.
Gunaratne fractured the base of his left thumb attempting to take a catch in the slips offered by Indian opener Sikhar Dhawan during the first Test at Galle in July and has not played any cricket since.
The Sri Lanka team is due to leave for India on October 8.
NO APPROVAL WITHOUT FITNESS TEST REPORT
In another new development Labrooy stated that all the teams selected and sent to the Minister of Sports for ratification should have the fitness test report (ie the yoyo and skinfold tests) attached against the names of each and every player selected.
This was a directive we received from the Sports Minister to prove that the individual selected is declared physically fit. Without the report the Minister would not accept the names. We have been following this procedure since we picked the teams for the series against Pakistan, said Labrooy.
The Minister it is reliably learnt will be expanding this fitness test report procedure to all other sports from January 1, 2018.

Bank for development finance on the cards - PM
The government would soon set up a special Bank for Development Finance to assist the business community, said Prime Minister Ranil Wicrkaramasinghe.
Speaking at the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Sri Lanka Confectionery Manufacturers Association at Colombo Hilton last Tuesday night he said the prime objective of this is to assist the business community by offering them credit under more flexible terms.
The Premier also said that he still remembers the beginning of the confectionery industry of Sri Lanka and the shift from Huntley and Farmers, Cadbury and Nestle confectionery exports era to people shifting to local products.
I endorse the view of Special Assignment Minister Dr Sarath Amunugama that the birth of the local confectionery era began when imports were banned under the closed economy period from 1971 to 1977.I must also say that though there are confectionery imports of around 20%, Sri Lankans still prefer to use local products since their quality are of very high standard. This is why global companies like Walls Ice Cream and Cadbury failed in Sri Lanka.
Wickramasinghe also recalled that when both the local confectionery and apparel industry were started how former Finance Minister, Ronnie De Mel branded the apparel industry as Jangi (pants) and people called the confectionery industry as Seeni Bola.
However people like Munchee, Maliban and Upali Wijewardene, (Delta) stood against all odds and started the local construction industry and today both these industries have matured as major export industries reaching out to over 55 countries.
He appealed to the confectionery giants in Sri Lanka to assist the small timers who too are talented but need guidance. Referring to timely requests made by the Confectionery Manufacturers Association Chairperson Shanaz Hakeem, the PM said that the government will address these issues.
Yes some of them were proposed at the last budget and we will soon implement them. We will also bring in the Anti Dumping Bill soon.
After explaining the Sri Lanka debt repayment scenario the Premier said that the Rs three trillion debt would be settled soon and then the government would offer more concessions. We also need to find Rs 600 billion for development and there are also balance of payments and other issues to settle.

Beware, the enemy within
Protecting Buddhism; a personal reflection
One of the issues being widely discussed today is how to protect Buddhism. As I have been a Buddhist for nearly 45 years it is an issue that greatly interests me and I would like to say something about it. But before doing so it will be necessary to ask and then try to answer the question: Is Buddhism threatened and if so by what or whom In my four decades as a monk I have travelled to every Buddhist country, living in some of them, and most regions where Buddhism prevails. And in some of these places I have seen evidence that my religion is under very real threat. The ones that I noticed most were these: an indolent and ignorant Sangha; the promotion of various superstitions rather than the Dhamma; a devout but ignorant laity; and the squandering of resources on showy but ultimately useless projects (gigantic Buddha statues, lavish temples, colourful but empty rituals, etc.), rather than activities that can help promote genuine Dhamma knowledge. Just recently I met a Thai monk who had told me that he had been in the Sangha for 19 years and during our chat he mentioned that he had hardly ever read a book on Dhamma and never read the Tipitaka.
I was really taken aback by this admission but he just laughed and shrugged his shoulders. I later learned that he makes a fairly good living selling the supposedly protective magic charms which are popular in Thailand. Years ago when I was studying in Kandy, the temple I was staying in had a regular although rather lacklustre dhampasala. One Sunday I noticed that no children turned up for the usual Dhamma activities and I asked the loku hamuduruvo why this was. He seemed rather embarrassed and just mumbled something about problems.
In fact, the previous Sunday he had sent the children home with a note for their parents saying that the dhampasala was permanently closed. The abbot has decided to rent out his hall for tuition classes and sure enough, the following Sunday the temple became the venue for English, Econ 1, Econ 2 and Maths classes. These and other similar incidents have made me come to the conclusion that yes, Buddhism faces several quite serious threats and needs to be protected from them.
Offer guidance and advice
Just recently a Sinhala friend passed me a Colombo newspaper and in it was a report about someone, a monk as it happens, claiming that Buddhism was in imminent danger and what he and his supporters were going to do about it. To my amazement some of the actions he was proposing were a march and a demonstration, and he ended by even suggesting that this might include violence. I thought I had read the passage mentioning this incorrectly. A Buddhist monk, a bhikkhu, a representative of the Buddha, threatening violence No that cant be right, I said to myself. So I re-read the section only to discover that I had read it correctly first time. Politicians threatening violence I could understand. Overly excited sports fans becoming violent I have heard of before. I know gangsters quite often threaten or resort to violence to get what they want. But a Buddhist monk! I could hardly believe my eyes.
During my life I have often found that when I am confronted by some problem or some quandary that I can usually find something the Buddha said that can offer me guidance and advice. So after reading the article I started looking through the suttas to see if the Buddha said anything about some of the problems this person said was endangering Buddhism and what can and should be done about it. I turned to the Buddhas third discourse, the Fire Sermon (Adittapariyaya Sutta) and I read his powerful and poignant words: Burning, burning! The whole world is burning! Burning with what Burning with greed, hatred and delusion.
In its simplest terms this pinpoints the root cause of all our self-inflicted problems. One persons greed, hatred or delusion evokes similar reactions in the person who it is directed towards. Someone who takes the Dhamma seriously has the courage, the wisdom and the patience to break the cycle by not giving in to those three ugly qualities. This reminded me of what the Buddha said in the Dhammapada: Hatred never ceases through more hatred. It is through love that hatred ceases. This is an ancient truth. And of course greed and delusion likewise never peter out by being more greedy or more ignorant.
This Dhammapada verse in turn reminded me of something somewhere in the Samyutta Nikaya which I spent 15 minutes trying to find and eventually did. It says this: Worst of the two is he who retaliates when abused. He who does not retaliate wins a battle hard to win. These and other things the Buddha said are talking about solving or at least skilfully managing problems on a personal level, but I wondered if he ever said anything about protecting the Dhamma from threats it might encounter. So I called on my good friend Ven. XYZ, a Sinhala monk I have always respected for his considered and practical wisdom.
I emailed him about what I was looking for and within a short time he got back to me with two references from the Samyutta Nikaya. I looked them up and the first one said this: Earth, water, fire or wind cannot make the good Dhamma disappear. But foolish people right here will make it disappear. Startling words indeed, and ones that every Buddhist should ponder very carefully. According to the Buddha, external objects or events cannot make the Dhamma disappear but foolish people (mogha purisa) actually within Buddhism can.
If the Buddha is correct this would mean that we should be paying attention to individuals within Buddhism rather than outside it as the possible threat to the religion. How could they do this By giving it a bad reputation through their words and actions By failing to put it into practice By using it for their own aggrandisement rather than for helping others Possibly by all these things and more.
Protect Dhamma
Then I looked up the second reference my friend sent me. It said: Someone asked the Lord, What is the cause, what is the reason, why the good Dhamma does not last long after the Tathagata has attained final Nirvana The Lord replied, If the four foundations of mindfulness are not developed and cultivated the good Dhamma will not last long.
This seems to both add to and confirm what the first passage says; that the best way to ensure that the Dhamma flourishes and lasts long is to practice it. As individuals we may not be in a position to have an impact on the many problems the country faces but if we practice the Dhamma at least we will not be making these problems worse. And more importantly, we will be helping to protect the Dhamma.
The simple truth is that you cannot protect Buddhism by not practising it. And even the most ill-informed person knows that inflammatory language, threats of violence, acting without thinking first, anger and hatred, are about as far from the gentle wisdom of the Buddha as it is possible to get.
Sri Lanka faces numerous problems, many of them longstanding and complex, and there is no easy solution to some of them.
However, to jettison Buddhism as soon as one is confronted by problems and fall back on anger and hatred is definitely not the way to go. During a crisis is the very time to look to the life skills the Buddha offered us.
Possible solutions need to be considered in a spirit of kindness; they need to be implemented with fairness; adversaries need be reasoned with or appealed to; negations need be conducted with mild language; digging up the past and allotting blame need to be avoided; getting all the facts should be done before making accusations; and most importantly, those who deal with division and hatred should not be listened to.
Now is the time when the contents of a hundred banas, a thousand dhampasala classes, and ten thousand Dhamma books need to be taken seriously.

The vast majority of our country, our religious leaders, want unity and reconciliation, she said. Let the minority shout while the majority does what is correct.
Kumaratunga said the examples of student art, dealing with ideas like tolerance and acceptance, signified hope for the future. To create and instill such ambitions in the minds of our children, in order to establish peace and unity, is a very praiseworthy task, she said.

CITADEL OF  PATRIOTISM
Old Boys Union  1993 Group
Ananda College imparted education to many men of action who played prominent roles to uphold the interests of the people and country, religion and culture by infiltrating the slaves who embraced the alien culture then and held in high esteem the worldly pleasure provided by them than the freedom of the people and religion, is a quoted passage written by an old boy of Ananda College and an anti-imperialist freedom fighter Philip Gunawardena.
The above statement clearly illustrates the reasons for the birth of Ananda College, Colombo which is engaged in rendering social services and walking majestically even today after reaching 131 years on November 1, 2017.
Vision of the College
Despite the fact that the Anandians were more proficient in the English language than the Englishmen, they stood by their principles without becoming slaves to it. The then Principal of Ananda College L.H. Mettananda and the academics of Ananda College strongly agitated to grant the foremost place to the mother tongue, Sinhala language and that it should be made the official language.
In addition, when they voiced that the Science subject could not be taught in Sinhala, the intellectuals such as the then Principal of Ananda College M.W. Karunananda strongly expressed that the Science subject could be taught in Sinhala language and engaged himself in the task of writing and publishing the books needed in Sinhala. Hence, the contribution made by Ananda College in making the Sinhala as the official language is immeasurable.
Ananda College laid the foundation for the establishment of many schools similar to the branches spreading from a tree. As a result of that, glittering schools such as Dharmaraja College, Kandy, Mahinda College, Galle, Rahula College, Matara and Maliyadeva College, Kurunegala emerged. The main reason for Ananda College to march forward even after passing a hundred years was because from the very inception did not have any differences or discordant views. Anandians who held their own ethnic group in high esteem never displayed racism. While they showed due respect to Buddhism never displayed any differences or discordant views about any other religions.
This situation was understood by many from the very beginning. Hence, the Christian priest Reverend Father Leadbeater who became the very first Principal of Ananda College took steps to teach Buddhism not only to the students but also to the teachers according to the vision of the College. Even though the subsequent school Principals Bultjens, Davies Moor and Fritz Kunz belonged to different ethnic communities and religions, they worked with firm determination from the day they assumed duties as Principals of Ananda College to establish a future generation of Buddhists following the right path. The endeavour made by the experts belonging to other ethnic communities such as T.B. Jayah, A.H. Sundararaman, V.T.S. Sivagurunathan and E.M. Selvaratnam in the Administrative Committee to attain the vision of Ananda College was indeed a marvellous deed.
Great personalities
Those who were appointed as Principals of Ananda College, irrespective of their status, dedicated their services considering the country first and made gigantic efforts to create great personalities the country needed. That was indeed a stupendous feat. Among them the services rendered by Sir D.B. Jayatillake, P. De S. Kularatne, Professor G.P. Malalasekara, L.H. Mettananda, M.W. Karunananda, Colonel G.W. Rajapaksa, Colonel V.S. Kudaligama, A.P. Gunaratne T.B. Damunupola and Kithsiri Liyanagamage to the country should be held in high esteem.
The vision of Ananda College to create dynamic personalities and achieving that task within a hundred years is indeed a matter to be proud of. Hence, the incumbent Principal S.M. Keerthiratne and the Administrative Committee, the Old Boys Union, the students along with the Buddhist populace should be determined to forge ahead on the occasion of the 131st anniversary of Ananda College.

CMC restrained from dumping garbage in Muthurajawela
The Supreme Court yesterday issued an Interim Order until the final determination of a Fundamental Rights petition, preventing authorities including the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) from dumping garbage in the Muthurajawela Sanctuary.
The three-judge-Bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Eva Wanasundara and Justice Vijith Malalgoda made this order pursuant to a fundamental rights petition filed by 35 residents living in close proximity of the Muthurajawela Sanctuary, seeking an Interim Order directing the authorities not to store or dump garbage in the Sanctuary.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court also granted leave to proceed with this petition and argument was fixed for March 12. The Court further ordered the Director General of Wildlife to formulate a map pertaining to Muthirajawela Sanctuary in accordance with the Wildlife Department gazette notification.
Counsel Senani Dayaratne appearing for the CMC informed Court that the CMC was not disposing garbage at the Muthurajawela Sanctuary.

Commission to investigate alleged financial fraud at Mihin Lanka
Co-Cabinet spokesman and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday a Presidential Commission will be appointed to investigate alleged financial fraud and irregularities that had taken place at Mihin Lanka during the former regime. He said that Mihin Lanka, has been running at a loss ever since commencing operations more than nine years ago. It was revealed that the airline had owed Rs.4,860 million to the Peoples Bank and Rs.1,700 million to SriLankan Airlines respectively.
Mihin was a bad political decision taken during the previous regime.
It was hurriedly launched badly managed and the losses stampeded. The Director Board was also highly politicised representing the former President, former Defence Secretary and former External Affairs Ministry Monitoring MP Sajin Vas Gunawardene. Air craft were also leased to the airline without following the tender procedures. These reasons have led to the loss.
We are exploring possibilities to sell the airlines license to a third party for operational purposes. The issue has been discussed during the Presidents recent visit to Qatar and further discussion will be held in coming weeks, Minister Senaratne said.

My five visits to the  country manifest the  openness and willingness  on the part of the  government to engage in constructive dialogue
Delivering on Transitional Justice
Sri Lanka is a different place than it was at the end of the conflict in 2009.
Roads connect the South to the North and East, free of rigorous military checkpoints. Foreign direct investment and tourism are up.
On the surface, it would appear that the process of transitional justice, or a societys attempt to come to terms with a history of violence, is steadily underway.
But Dr. Pablo de Greiff, the top UN expert on the subject said in his official visit to Sri Lanka last week that the country continues to deprive itself of the benefits of transitional justice.
The process is nowhere close to where it should have been more than two years later, he said in remarks at the UN Compound in Colombo on October 23.
De Greiff said that political fighting was slowing down the countrys path towards transitional justice.
Once a central aspect of the 2015 elections, the term transitional justice has since become mired in partisan debate.
The hard-right Buddhist group Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) fuels this fire with their rhetoric of Sinhala nationalism, consistently opposing investigations and reform. Politicians in the joint opposition seem happy to toe the line.
Undelivered promises
Meanwhile, many in Tamil civil society point to areas where they believe promised transitional justice measures havent been delivered. Students at the University of Jaffna went on strike last week protesting the detention of prisoners held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, a law which the government has promised to replace.
The anti-transitional justice voices have become too strident, said Mario Gomez, the Executive Director of the Colombo-based International Centre for Ethnic Studies. According to him, those elements are holding the government captive.
The government needs to communicate that transitional justice is not just for the Tamils, Muslims, and families of the soldiers, he said.Sri Lankans will not reconcile unless they deal with the past, however hard that may be.
Transitional justicebenefiting all communities
In his multiple public remarks in Sri Lanka this month, including two lectures in Jaffna and Colombo, Dr. de Greiff also argued that transitional justice mechanisms could benefit all communities, both majority, and minority.
Transitional justice processes are nothing like witch hunts, they do not involve massive purges and do not trade on charges of collective responsibility or guilt by association, he said.
Instead, he argued, a transitional justice agenda that delivers truth, justice, reparations, and guarantees of non-recurrence would build trust in the government and bridge communal divides.
It is worth recalling that this is a country in which every community has victims, he said. So, in addition to the Tamil victims during and at the end of the conflict, a quick list of victims that are still awaiting redress include  many victims of terrorist attacks, the family members of the over 600 policemen gruesomely murdered in 1990, and the Muslim population forced out of Jaffna in 1990.
No one is safe ifviolence is tolerated
He said the narrative that victims are from only one community, and are seeking retribution against a majority-controlled government, was a result of manipulation and gross simplification.
The1971 (JVP) insurrection, and the 1987-89 violence, and LTTE violence against Tamils are examples of intra-communal violence, showing what we know to be the case, he said. Wherever violations are tolerated, no one is safe, and that the violations tend to recur.
De Greiff is from Colombia, a country with a long history of civil wars, and is the first and only-serving UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation, and guarantees of non-recurrence.
Drawing from his work around the world, I am totally convinced about the potential of transitional justice measures to achieve significant transformation, he said. While Sri Lanka has started a variety of transitional justice measures, like establishing an Office of Missing Persons and funding a housing project in the war-affected North and East, he said the country is missing a robust agenda touching on all four elements of transitional justice.
They are not like items in a menu in which people can pick and choose, he said.
But he said such thinking is common in post-conflict societies.
For example, while the government is attempting to shed truth on events that occurred during the war, like through the Office of Missing Persons, the truth must be accompanied by justice, he said. He argued that in effect, revealing that someone was killed extrajudicially, but prosecuting none of the executioners, amounts to a broken promise.
War crimes of both sidesshould be investigated
Yet instead of making moves toward robust investigations of alleged war crimes, both by the Sri Lankan military and members of the LTTE, the government has promised from the highest levels that war heroes will be protected.
Prosecution of the last phase of the war is unlikely to happen in the near future, concluded Gomez, the head of ICES.
But de Greiff argued that prosecutions could be conducted in a way that is fair to both the alleged victims and perpetrators.
Sifting precisely between the legitimate and lawful use of force and the contrary, under conditions in which all relevant due process guarantees are meticulously adhered to, and in which not only the rights of victims but also the rights of suspects and the accused are protected, is one of the points of transitional justice accountability, he said.
Kumaravadivel Guruparan, the head of the Department of Law at the University of Jaffna, agreed that due process in justice proceedings must be followed in order for the government to gain the trust of all its citizens.
That lack of trust is why students at the University of Jaffna are boycotting classes, he said. They believe the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which was enacted as a temporary measure in 1979 to make it easier to detain people suspected of terrorist associations, has been used to violate Tamils due process rights.
Guruparan said that de Greiff is aware of these ongoing tensions, and had a fine line to walk in his closing statement.
Government willingto engage with UN
On the one hand, theres been no significant structural change on any of these issues, he said. But unlike the previous government, the Yahapalanaya government has shown that its willing to engage with the UN and the international community.
My five visits to the country manifest the openness and willingness on the part of the government to engage in constructive dialogue, de Greiff said at his end-of-mission press conference.
While speaking in Jaffna, at the Jaffna Public Library, de Greiff drew a metaphor from the history of the famous building.
The public library was one of the largest in Asia when it was burned in a riot in 1981. The library has since been restored and re-opened and remains one of the most beautiful buildings on the island.
I think human beings do not only endure but prevail. And I think that is true of the library as well. It has not only endured but it has prevailed, and I think that transitional justice can make a modest contribution to human beings not only enduring but prevailed over very, very difficult pasts, he said.
But at the end of his 14-day official visit, he delivered a warning to all Sri Lankans.
The success and sustainability of transitional justice depend also on the conviction of people that defend it, that define it, decide it, and implement it, he said.

FALIA holds alumni get-together in Sri Lanka
The Foundation for the Advancement of Life and Insurance Around the world (FALIA) Japan, recently hosted the alumni get-together in Sri Lanka, at which the title of Grandmaster was conferred on Ceylinco Lifes Managing Director R. Renganathan.
The FALIA get-together was attended by past attendees of FALIA seminars, three dignitaries from Japan, Messrs Toru Nagashima, Managing Director FALIA, Takashi Matsumoto, a former President of FALIA and President of the Federation of National Public Service Personnel Mutual Aid Associations and Yoshitaka Masai, Director of FALIA, and Indrani Sugathadasa, Chairperson of the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL).
The life time honorific of Grandmaster recognises three decades of leadership in the development and growth of the life insurance industry in Sri Lanka during which Renganathan set up and steered Ceylinco Life, taking the company to market leadership in 2004, a position it has retained to date.
Over the past 47 years, FALIA has contributed very significantly to the development of life insurance in Asia, Renganathan said.
It has helped build the knowledge base of the industry through seminars and training. Ceylinco Life has implemented many learnings from these seminars and I am honoured to be appointed Grandmaster.

Fed set to hold rates steady
The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday as speculation swirls on who will be its next leader, but the US central bank will likely point to a firming economy as it edges closer to a possible rate rise next month.
The Fed has raised rates twice since January and currently forecasts one more hike by the end of the year as part of a tightening cycle that began in late 2015.
Investors have all but ruled out a move at the end of this week's two-day policy meeting. The Fed is due to issue its latest policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).
Markets will look to it for confirmation the central bank is on track for a December rate hike, though attention will quickly turn to who will be in charge of monetary policy at the end of Fed Chair Janet Yellen's first term in February 2018.

Final decision on Constitution after APC consensus: Rajitha
Co-Cabinet spokesman and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday that final decision with regard to the Constitution will be based on a consensus reached by an All Party Conference (APC) as suggested by President Maithripala Sirisena.
At the same time, the government will also call for a Conference of religious dignitaries and intellectuals to seek their ideas for the proposed new Constitution.
But,the people who protest against the new Constitution have no ideas about it and engaging in distorting the facts.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday, the Minister said the people who threatened to bomb Parliament did not air their views when they had the opportunity to do so.
But, now they are shouting unnecessarily with the aim of misguiding the people by distorting facts, Minister Senaratne said.
While TNA MP Mavai Senadhiraja has described the All Party Conference as a waste of time, it was Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan who said that the Constitution should not be passed without the support of the majority Sinhala community.
He further said that Federalism is only a structure of power devolution. The Supreme Court has also ruled that Federalism will not lead to separatism.
But,it is only a structure of power devolution, the Minister said.
He said that all parties had agreed to accept Sri Lanka as unitary state.
Responding to the question with regard to former Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshes view on the Constitution Assembly, the Minister asked why the former Minister is still in the Constitutional Assembly, if he has stated that the Assembly is unlawful.
Co-Cabinet Spokesman Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said never in the history as Parliament convened as a Constitutional Assembly for discussing the Constitutional reforms and also the public earlier did not get an opportunity to present their ideas.
We have already extended the hours of Parliament sittings to debate the proposals made in the Interim Report on the new Constitution to give more opportunity for political parties to present their views. People voted in favour of this government due to its promise of abolishing the Executive Presidency. We must not forget that promise, Minister Karunathilaka added.
Co-Cabinet Spokesman and Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said a new Constitution should be acceptable to all the people of the country. That is why the President proposed the All Party Conference. We need ample time to carry out hat task as it is most important to the country.
He said the SLFP has said that it wants to make the President more stronger if power is devolved. But if the President is against that,we think about that as well.We remember how, the former President acted to strengthen the power. He never wants to curtail the powers. But,President Maithripala Sirisena is not like that and he always wants to reduce the power of his office. But,we are also against the creation of the Executive Prime Minister instead of the Executive Presidency.

Finest  Shakespearean  insults
English literature's greatest son, William Shakepeare, is credited with play of words that has taught, inspired and delighted people across generations.
While one does admire the beauty of the Shakespearean language, let us not forget the bard's wit in throwing the most amusing and hard-hitting of insults. Here are a few you may be inspired to use in everyday life.
Henry IV Part 1
Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button, not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch
Macbeth
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
Where gotst thou that goose look
Henry IV
Away, you scullion! You rampallion! You fustilarian! I'll tickle your catastrophe.
Measure for Measure
Thou art a flesh-monger, a fool and a coward.
Alls Well That Ends Well
A most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise breaker, the owner of no one good quality.
Macbeth
Go, prick thy face, and over-red thy fear, Thou lily-liverd boy.
Henry IV Part 1
Thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson obscene greasy tallow-catch!

First int'l conference on real estate management and valuation held
Industry leaders, academics, investors, planners, developers, decision makers, public officials and attorneys from various chapters converged in Colombo on Tuesday to take the stock of the country's real estate scenario, at an international conference. The International Conference on Real Estate Management and Valuation (ICREMV-2017) was held at Hilton Residences, Colombo, under the theme "Smart Real Estate- toward Unmet Socio- Economic Needs.
The conference brought about a transformation in the real estate sector with emerging global trends in real estate industry. The convention deliberated on land valuation mechanisms to promote genuine real estate activities, opportunities and challenges for the Port of Colombo to become a hub port, development planning related to resettlement projects, factors affecting the competitiveness of Kandy as a heritage tourism destination, smart real estate and ethics for valuation among other subjects that touch on real estate development.
Prof. Deborah Susan Levy, Head of Department of Property, University of Auckland, delivering the keynote address at CREMV-2017, spotlighted that properties have to be fixed for purpose, and they have to be multi-functional in today's context in the corporate real estate sector.
"Even in the corporate world, one has to ask whether these smart corporate buildings are actually looking after our unmet socioeconomic needs," she said.
"We need satisfaction at the workplace, we need to feel satisfied with our working environment, we need to collaborate with people. In order to do that, and if we do, we become more productive. It is all about people and their behaviour. We have to think about satisfaction, productivity and collaboration. Coming together by academics and industries is very powerful," she said.
"You have to look, if buildings are a huge resource, how we use it productively. The properties have to be flexible. They have to give space sufficiently. People are looking at work-life balance. Technology has to be responsive and fit for purpose," she said.
"The property management or how we use our buildings is very important. We can have all the wonderful layouts and top buildings, but if we do not manage them properly, people aren't going to enjoy working in them and be productive. "Whether it is low income or high income, we have to think about people, whether they are satisfied with their working environs," she stated.
The Secretary of the Ministry of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms, Dr. I H K Mahanama was the Chief Guest at ICREMV-2017.
It was organized by the Research and Professional Development Centre of the Department of Estate Management and Valuation, working collaboratively with Sri Lanka Government Valuation Department, Urban Development Authority, Colombo Municipal Council, University of Sri Jayawardenepura and industry partners.
Prof. K G P K Weerakoon chaired inaugural session of the conference. Estate Management and Valuation Department head Dr. N.C.Wickremaarachchi, Management Studies and Commerce Dean Dr .U Anura Kumara, and Sri Jayawardenepura University Vice Chancellor Prof Sampath Amaratunga were at the head table.
ICREMV Secretary T G Upuli P Perera extended the vote of thanks.

Fundamental Rights petition filed by Perpetual Treasuries dismissed

The Supreme Court today refused to grant leave to proceed with a Fundamental Rights petition filed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) challenging the Central Bank's decision to suspend PTL Limited from carrying out business and other activities as a Primary Dealer.
The Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare and Justice Nalin Perera refused to grant leave to proceed with the petition stating that there is no legal basis to proceed with the petition.

Govt has failed to address confectionery industry issues  Shanaz Hakeem
The Confectionery Industry is faced with series of issues and the government is not addressing them, said Chairperson, Lanka Confectionery Manufacturers Association Shanaz Hakeem.
The industry has shown a year on year growth of 2.4% and account to over 100, 000 direct employments and has paid over Rs 50 billion as taxes to the government last year. In addition the industry has earned over US$ 100 million foreign exchange to the country.
The duty on raw materials is having a tremendous negative impact in the industry and the CESS too is a major concern. In addition high cost of energy too is another issue. The government is planning to have an FTA as well as ETCA pact with China and India and before these are implemented the anti dumping bill must be implemented.
She also pointed out that the packaging process and food labeling process of their produce too has double standers as imported confectionery items just need a sticker while local products have a different and more expensive procedure. Hakeem also said that locally produced TV and advertising materials are taxed in addition to their production costs making it an additional financial burden. However foreign confectionery advertisements are aired free of charge on Cable TV and here again no level playing field is created, she alleged.
She pointed out that this issue was brought up earlier and a tax on Cable TV airing advertisements were proposed at the last budget but they were yet to be implemented. She appealed from Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe to implement these proposals and address some of the anomalies that were highlighted. (SS)

Hayleys Fabric made a profit of US$ 95,854 during the second quarter ended September 30, 2017.
This is an improvement on the first quarter although the company is at a cumulative loss of US$ 66,794 for the first half ending September 30, 2017.
The main contributory factor for the loss was the unprecedented floods which hampered the production in the first quarter.
The outlook for the next quarter amidst an increase in raw material costs looks positive with an order book with better margins with production from new machinery also coming into operation.
The enhancement of the Printing facility with Reactive printing and the commencement of sublimation printing, embossing facilities would enhance the companys product offering to attract a higher market share.

Hublot presents the first mechanical golf watch  with aperture display
The Swiss watchmaker has joined forces with world #1 Golfer Dustin Johnson to unveil a watch that is dedicated to the ultimate precision sport  golf. Hublot has designed, developed, manufactured and assembled a module to equip its new UNICO movement, which has been specifically created for golf. The MHUB1580 movement allows golfers to seamlessly calculate their score whilst on course. Hublots mechanical golf watch features aperture displays
and is ultra-lightweight, providing true sports performance.
Dustin Johnson is recognized for his perfect timing  along with power, control and precision. Golf watches exist, but they tend to be digital. His influence and impact on the game inspired Hublots new golf watch. Mechanically advanced, brilliantly functional, contemporary look and easy to use, it is a fusion of Hublots philiosophy and DJs signature; simple, intuitive and extremely effective, said Ricardo Guadalupe, CEO Hublot.
Together, the Partnership look set to shake up the world! They share a vision and style that are undoubtedly effective, if not exactly orthodox. Dustin and Hublot, golf and watchmaking both about precision, timing and perfection. They are the result of hard work and perseverance, pushing the boundaries and a tireless quest for excellence. Together, they are proud to unveil the Big Bang Unico Golf. A true all-in-one golf watch. The Big Bang Unico Golf has a contemporary design and is easy to use. It has digital displays and is very light  less than 100 grams on the wrist. It has everything that I want from a golf watch and is the perfect fit.
Dustin Johnson, Hublot Ambassador, Major Champion and World #1 Hublot carried out a real-life test by inviting its friends to measure the length of their drives against those of Dustin Johnson on a simulator.
Quite a challenge, as the worlds number 1 golfer pushes the Trackman technology to the limit with his extraordinary strokes!
The case of the Big Bang Unico Golf is carved from Texalium, an innovative material, exclusive to Hublot, that is an amalgamation of carbon fiber and aluminum. This unique composite gives the watch its lightness. The watch weighs precisely 97.93 grams!
The Big Bang Unico Golf has the look of a chronograph and has been conceived as a chronograph. Its movement features return-to-zero heart piece cams that ensure the counting mechanism is robust and reliable.
The putter-shaped pusher at 2 o-clock activates the mechanism for displaying the number of strokes taken and counts the strokes per hole. The pusher at 4 oclock allows the wearer to move on to the next hole by resetting the stroke counter to zero.
The counter at 6 oclock displays the total number of strokes played and is simultaneously updated. The pusher at 8 o'clock is shaped like a tee.
This resets the mechanism and sets the counters to zero at the end of the round. During the round, this button can be locked by rotating it by 45, thus ensuring that it is not inadvertently activated.
The MHUB1580 full-skeleton movement allows the wearer to admire and understand how the timepiece works.
The watch comes with two interchangeable wristbands fitted with the One Click system. One is made of white leather sewn on rubber and designed like a golf glove, while the other is made of technical fabric with a Velcro fastener to ensure the watch sits perfectly on the wrist.

JOs about turn surprises PM
It seems strange that the Joint Opposition (JO) disagrees with the governments gesture to accept the most salient proposals made by the Joint Opposition itself, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe yesterday.
He said that most of the proposals made by the Joint Opposition, including the creation of a conducive environment for the Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims to live peacefully protecting the unitary status were identical to that of the United National Party, as well as with the Tamil National Alliance.
Due to this reason, the Premier invited the Joint Opposition to join in order to make the effort successful through discussions.
He made these observations yesterday during the debate on the Interim Report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms in Parliament.
Premier Wickremesinghe said that Mahinda Rajapaksa, also, during the election, asked for a mandate to set up a Constitutional Council to formulate a new Constitution. He said that they too asked for the same during the General Election and we cant go against the mandate.
So, we have been bestowed the responsibility of drafting a Constitution Bill to be considered before Parliament for formulating a new Constitution for Sri Lanka, Premier Wickremesinghe said. What the Parliament has to do is only to pass same.
The Prime Minister further said as an initiation, various Sub Committees were set up, including the Steering Committee and another seven Sub Committees. He added that the six Sub Committees were given six separate subjects.
He also added that in addition, another ad-hoc committee was appointed under the leadership of Minister Susil Premajayantha. He said that the reports of those committees have been handed over to this assembly.
As the Constitutional Assembly we all got together, agreed and the first step was taken, the Prime Minister said. The Steering Committee decided to work on the other subjects which were not bestowed on any sub committee, including the nature of the state, on Buddhism, devolution of power, judiciary etc. While the discussions were in progress in the committees, Parliament queried that it needed to know as to what the committees were doing in this regard. Later, we prepared this interim report to keep the House informed, with several proposals.
He said that there were no decisions here but only what was discussed there. He added that it was not a draft or a Constitution. The first section had the views and the second contained views of the members on the first section.
Now we have to attend to the second step, the Premier said. After considering the Sub Committee reports and the views of the public the Steering Committee should direct a report to the Constitutional Assembly along with a Draft Constitution Bill. That is the step that we have to come to . So far we have not considered the reports of the sub committees and the public views. Now we have to consider those reports.
He said then they would go to meet the Mahanayake Theras, the Anunayake Theras and religious dignitaries. He added so that this cant be completed within two weeks. It might drag on for a few months. As parties, lets discuss them here, the Premier said.
Before we prepare our report we have a responsibility to have a wide corporation with the public and discuss with them and send the report back to the Constitutional Council. After the Constitutional Council Discussed the matter we can ask it to send their final report back to the Constitutional Assembly with the amendments. They can keep quiet or refuse what we have sent to them. But if the final report is not passed here everything can come to an end.
Premier Wickremesinghe said that if it was passed before the Constitutional Council with a simple majority, it should be brought before Parliament. He added that if it was passed with a two thirds majority in Parliament, the same would be presented before the Cabinet of Ministers and brought same before the Parliament as the Constitution Bill. But, if the Constitutional Council passed it with a two thirds majority, the same would be taken before the Cabinet of Ministers and Cabinet in turn would bring same before Parliament as the Constitution Bill. Thereafter Parliament could make a decision and then go for a referendum.
He said that this could not be done instantly or divide the country. There is no secret here, the Premier said. Now what we have got to do is to continue on. Most important here is that all the parties submitted their report for the first time. In 1972, the Federal Party did not participate. In 1978, the Tamil Liberation Front did not participate while the SLFP left after submitting a report. The package of G.L.Peiris was not agreed to and Tissa Vitharanas one was not agreed with too.
He queried should this process that was participated by all despite their differences be aborted or continued on. There are issues yet and we have to discuss and go forward.
The PM said from the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayagam Pact the issues propped up. When the Sinhala language was made the official language there was an issue with the Tamils and Rata Sabah. It proved a failure. The the Dudley- Chelvanayagam Pact was signed. At that time a Budddhist monk died in a protest and it came to an end, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said. When the late J.R.Jayewardene formulated the 1978 Constitution the Tamil Liberation Front said that they had a mandate for a separate state. However, they participated in the District Development Sabha and asked for more powers. Although J.R. Jayewardene gave them, the others objected. If those additional powers were given to the District Development Sabha, we wouldnt have had to face this todays situation.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that when the 13th Amendment was brought about there was criticism that the country would be divided, yet the Supreme Court maintained that the Unitary Status would be protected. Those who criticized accept it today, the Premier said.
The war was over yet the issue is not over and has been extended to the Muslims too. Not only the Muslims, but the Mahanayake of the Malwatta Chapter had to face the situation too. But now lets go further. Lets discuss and find the best solution,the Prime Minister said.
He further said that they were not there to wipe out the Sinhala Buddhists while being Sinhala Budddhists and to destroy the countrys unitary status. He said the Constitutional Assembly was not Maithripala Sirisena or Ranil Wickremesinghe, but all as a whole. Therefore, all should get together and have the honour of accomplishing it. He added that suggestions of all the parties should be heeded to.
For example take the proposals of the Joint Opposition. They say that they suggest, as the Mahanayake Theras state, that a Constitution should not be formulated that affects the unitary status of country and the status accorded to Buddhism. Not only the JO, we too agree with it, the Premier said.
At this stage the Joint Opposition members began to shout.
When we agree the JO disagees with our stance. See what happens to the Mahanayake Theras. The JO suggests that an environment should be created for all Sinhalese, Muslims and Tamils to live peacefully, protecting the countrys unitary status. Even the Opposition Leader agrees, but not the JO. The other proposal of the JO is that the supremacy of the people should be protected .We too agree with that.
We are ready to consider to allow Section 5 of the 1978 Constitution to go unchanged as the JO suggests, We can protect Buddhism. Their proposal that the provinces should not be merged can be discussed as it cannot be done without the peoples mandate. Once you suggested to divide the country as Ruhunu, Maya, Pihiti and we agree if the people agree to do so, the Premier said. Another proposal was that the Presidential system should be changed and we can discuss it too. Another proposal was to elect the Prime Minister within the Parliament and it can be done. The other proposal that the Opposition Leader should be elected within the Opposition in Parliament. But Prasanna disagrees with their own proposal. That is not our issue.
The Premier stated that he also readily agrees with the JOs proposal that the Provincial Council system should not be a threat to the unitary status. We too try to fulfill the pledge of the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to grant 13 plus, protecting the countrys unitary status, the Premier said. The other proposal is that the powers of Local Government institutions should be increased. I like it, but some Ven. monks do not agree. The proposal says that local businessmen should be strengthened. We agree and let us give back what was acquired from Daya Gamage to strengthen the local businessman.
The Prime Minister proposed, since the government agrees with the proposals of the Joint Opposition he would invite them to work together to make the effort fruitful.

Jumbo gathering
With the rise of the dry season in the north central province of Sri Lanka, comes the extremely rare opportunity to witness The Gathering, the coming together of hundreds of elephants in Minneriya National Park. Globally hailed as a truly incredible sight, The Gathering has been named the sixth greatest wildlife spectacle in the world by Lonely Planet. During the peak month of October, guests visiting Cinnamon Lodge Habarana and Habarana Village by Cinnamon will have the fortune of watching herds of hundreds of these gentle giants, as they congregate around the Minneriya Reservoir.
Herds of elephants
With the onset of the dry spell in the region, the water levels of the Minneriya Reservoir recede, inducing a fresh growth of vegetation. Despite the hot and dry weather, the lush flora and water readily available at the Minneriya Resevoir attracts hundreds of elephants from various surrounding areas, including Polonnaruwa, Trincomalee, Matale and Kaudulla. It is estimated that during the peak of this great elephant gathering, up to 200-300 elephants come together at the same place to bathe, court, drink, feed and socialize, making it the largest congregation of Asian elephants in the world.
A safari in Minneriya
The wildlife safaris offered by Cinnamon Lodge Habarana and Habarana Village by Cinnamon in Minneriya National Park, are conducted by Cinnamon Nature Trails, the award-winning eco-tourism division of Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts. These jeep safaris provide the perfect opportunity for wildlife enthusiasts to observe and experience this magnificent wildlife spectacle firsthand. The Cinnamon team works with an experienced team of naturalists, drivers and trackers to provide an insightful safari experience to guests that is filled with valuable information. The safaris enable guests to not only observe these large herds in their natural habitat but also to learn more about their habits and social structures.
Protecting Minneriyas elephants
As part of an ongoing collaboration between Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts and the Centre for Conservation and Research, Cinnamon Lodge Habarana and Habarana Village by Cinnamon have been actively involved in the Cinnamon Elephant Project, an initiative focused on elevating elephant viewing based tourism to the next level. The project endeavours to further enrich and enhance the visitors experience by providing them with exclusive insights on the congregation and dispersal patterns of smaller elephant herds that come together to form the larger gathering at Minneriya National Park.
Moreover, the behavioral, health and demographic data gathered during the course of the project also ensures the well-being of the elephants, enabling them to be monitored, which in turn benefits the nations long-term efforts to conserve and protect the Asian elephant. By tracking and monitoring these herds, the field teams are able to keep track of their movements and act on any concerns or health issues that might be affecting them.
Commenting on the iconic wildlife phenomenon that can be observed in Minneriya National Park during the dry season, Head of Cinnamon Nature Trails Chitral Jayatilake said the dry season in the north central province of Sri Lanka, which is at its peak in October, serves as one of the best times to visit Minneriya National Park, where the extremely rare sighting of hundreds of elephants gathering in a single location can be enjoyed.

Kapruka and Grasshoppers to tie up with Amazon to facilitate SL producers
Sri Lankas pioneering e-commerce organization Kapruka.com has reached principle agreements to become an Amazon Master Seller with the global giant enabling local producers to sell to export market using amazon.com.
Once the agreement is finalized, Sri Lankan producers will have access to US, Europe and other markets through Amazon.com.
This means any handicraft maker or tea trader or even a shoe designer can sell their creations on Amazon.com for the very first time. The link will enable Sri Lankan SMEs and high-end producers to showcase their products to a global market, said Kapruka.com Founding Chairman Dulith Herath.
The link fills a much felt void in the countrys e-commerce market, where Sri Lankan SMEs will gain complete access to full range of turn-key solutions provided by Amazon.
Opening an Amazon seller account, shipping the products and accepting online transactions are key barriers for Sri Lankan sellers to date.
The agreement reached between Amazon.com and Kapruka.com and Grasshoppers will seek to eliminate these challenges for the Sri Lankan suppliers.
Amazon.com, the global e-commerce giant, is visited by over 160 million online customers in a quarter and open to markets in 180 countries. Third party sellers (eg. SMEs) can sell their products to these markets.
According to Herath, this agreement enables Sri Lankan products to be listed on Amazon USA, reaching the organizations customer base in 180 countries.
The stocks, on-demand, will be exported to US Amazon fulfilment centres by Kapruka.com and Grasshoppers, the sister company specialising in last mile delivery, will enable small producers in rural Sri Lanka to connect to this end-to-end channel from anywhere in the country. Kapruka.com will also facilitate local merchants to receive payments by-passing the barrier posed by absence of PayPal in the country.
Herath met with head of Fulfilment by Amazon team in the USA Kirsty Carey, during his on-going Eisenhower Scholarship program. Herath, who was selected for the prestigious Eisenhower Fellowship for the promises embodied by Grasshoppers and his pioneering achievements of Kapruka.com, is currently visiting global technology giants in USA under this scholarship. Grasshoppers is a start up co-founded by Dulith Herath and Dr Harsha Liyanage, that specialising in delivery fulfilment for e-commerce companies in Sri Lanka.

A laudable move
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) should be commended for its decision to send more Lankan cricket teams to Pakistan. This follows Sri Lanka's solitary 20-20 game against the hosts in Lahore, which went smoothly sans any security blues. The visit was Sri Lanka's first to Pakistan in 8 years following the harrowing experience of Mahela and his boys when the bus transporting the Lankan team came under a terrorist attack, in which 7 persons were killed and 5 team members injured. The incident put paid to all international sports in Pakistan, barring a low key visit by Zimbabwe and a World Eleven cricket team, since then, until Sunday's official 20-20 contest featuring Sri Lanka, at the same venue of the bloody mayhem, over eight years ago. True, there were misgivings in certain quarters, with even some established members of Lankan team pulling out of the tour, together with the team's South African coach. But all's well that ends well and the match was played before a sellout crowd, bringing smiles to the faces of the Pakistan cricket fans who were deprived of watching the home team play against top international sides for over eight years.
Soon after the arrival of the Lankan cricket team, back home, on Tuesday, SLC's Chief Executive Ashley de Silva announced that they have decided to resume official tours to Pakistan following the impressive security that was provided. The Board would be sending junior sides to Pakistan soon and the senior side would follow soon thereafter. Though Pakistan does not figure in Sri Lanka's Future Tours Programme a new schedule will be drawn up, as soon as possible, according to the CEO.
Pakistan certainly deserve a good turn after the lengths it went to get Sri Lanka admitted to the big league of Test playing nations, when the top nations gave us the cold shoulder. In fact, Pakistan contributed much more than even the Sri Lankan side, headed by late Minister Gamini Dissanayake, who staked our claim. Pakistan Cricket Board President, the late Abdul Hafeez Kadar, it was, who locked horns with the lords at Lords, putting forward Sri Lanka's case, with conviction, so much so, when his pleas were ignored, Kadar decided to form the Asian Cricket Association to rival the ICC.
One can also not forget how Pakistan moved in to save the blushes of Sri Lanka (along with India), by sending a team to this country when Australia and the West Indies refused to honour their obligations and forfeited their matches against SL, during the 1996 World Cup, ostensibly due to the terrorist threat.
In that context, it is fitting that Sri Lanka was provided with the opportunity to reciprocate in kind, by sending its own team, when Pakistan was given a wide berth by international sports teams, due to the terrorist threat. It is also appropriate that both, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera and SLC President Thilanga Sumathipala, were present at the venue to watch the game, conveying the solidarity of Sri Lanka, at government level.
Hopefully, the CEO's pledge would not be confined to words and would be followed up by concrete action. If not, it would be tantamount to giving into terrorism. Terrorism should not be allowed to have a free run in any country and dictate the course of events, even when it comes to sports. This was the fate of Sri Lanka too, when, following the Pettah bomb, at a time the New Zealand match was being played, we too had a barren run of international cricket.
True, international cricket teams may have had good reason to boycott Pakistan, since the attack took place outside a playing venue, and, while, the Test match was still in progress. Hence, the fears entertained may have been justified. But, the security setup has improved by leaps and bounds, since then, which had deeply impressed the visitors. Hence, it is hoped that Pakistan will soon be open again for international sports events, enabling its multitude of cricket fans and the followers of other sports to get their full fill of entertainment.
Beyond the realm of cricket, Sri Lanka has other reasons, too, to be grateful to Pakistan, particularly in the area of military assistance, during the separatist war in this country. When western countries, and, even India, showed a reluctance to provide certain types of weapons, to effectively deal with the terrorists it was Pakistan that stepped into the breach. Pakistan is also a great friend of Sri Lanka, both, in fair and foul weather, coming to our aid in the spheres of trade and economic assistance. It was one of the first countries that flew in considerable relief assistance in the wake of the Tsunami catastrophe and made massive contributions in funds.
Leaders of both countries, too, have been making regular visits to each other cementing existing bonds. It is therefore important that the prevailing goodwill between the two countries be enhanced, in whatever way possible, and the medium of sports is as good an agency as any, in the promotion of these ties.

Lock  it down!
Getting your foundation just right is tougher than it seems. From finding the best shade for your skin tone to applying the product evenly, achieving a flawless foundation base takes skill. Known as the base of beauty handiwork, foundation is the all-important canvas for the rest of your make up. Applying foundation and powder is seemingly simple to master if you are armed with the right tricks. Here is the why and how of it to get a flawless finish.
Types of foundation
Stick foundations are best for normal to dry skin. The coverage tends to be heavier, making them perfect for covering up blemishes, scars, reddened areas, and dark under-eye circles.
Mousse foundation is typically good for all skin types. However I think that it is best for mature skin because of its tendency to go on smoothly instead of caking up.
Powder foundation comes in compact form. Hence it makes a great foundation for women who want on-the-go portability. It is basically a powder and foundation in one.
For women interested in natural, organic makeup - mineral foundation is your absolute best bet. Mineral makeup is made up almost always primarily of minerals, which come from nature.
It is a great bet for women with sensitive skin or allergies. Waterproof foundation is made to stay on for a long time, which makes it perfect for humid areas and hot days. It also means you may not be able to remove it with just cleanser and water, you may need to use makeup remover.
Liquid foundation is a basic term for foundations that come in liquid form.
This is suited for dry skin and for mature skins and if not, for all skin types.
Choosing your foundation
When making your foundation choice there are things to consider. The first step is to match your skin tone and depth so that your foundation looks natural.
It is important to match your skin type with the correct foundation.
The real goal of your foundation is for it to look as if you are not wearing any at all. You simply give the illusion of having healthy, beautiful skin.
Matching your skin colour and foundation
The color of the foundation should match your natural skin tone. A good trick for finding the right shade of foundation is to test the foundation on your jaw line or forehead. Through this means you can find the correct shade for you.
Tinted moisturizer vs light foundation
The amount of colour pigment used in tinted moisturizer is usually less than foundation. Also, tinted moisturizers are actually a moisturizer with a little colour added. Therefore they should hydrate your skin better. A tinted moisturizer hydrates and evens out the complexion. A foundation covers the skin with a layer of colour and gives it a flawless finish.
Concealer or foundation first
If the skin under the eye area is dry or wrinkled, it helps to apply a lightweight moisturizer first and then apply the concealer. Concealers like this should always be applied before foundation.
Wear powder with foundation
You need to wear a powder with foundation as the powder helps the foundation to set. It helps to polish your look and adds smooth velvety softness to your skin.
Avoiding cakey, flaking patches of foundation
Lets be honest. The majority of us werent blessed with perfectly flawless skin, so foundation and/or concealer are a must for covering acne, age spots, and other imperfections that are part of being, wellHUMAN! The trick though is to not go overboard. Too much foundation and concealer will begin building up, and there you have itcake face!
Instead of applying multiple layers of light/medium-coverage face product to achieve your desired finish, use a Beauty Blender or foundation stippling brush to apply a THIN layer of FULL coverage foundation. If you dont need foundation (lucky you!), apply concealer ONLY on the areas youd like to smooth out and use your ring finger to gently blend into your natural skin.
Conceal a blemish without accentuating it
Dot thin coats of concealer directly onto the scar with your fingers, feathering out to just beyond its parameters. Don't over apply. Too many layers will make scars more noticeable. Gently, so as not to disturb the concealer, apply foundation and loose powder to keep everything in place.
Set your concealer
It is best to use the powder to set your concealer. The powder helps to set the concealer. Then you can use your foundation over it.
Going orange
Play it safe and choose a foundation that is one shade lighter than your skin tone. You can always add depth with bronzer. There are three possible skin undertones - warm, cool, or a mixture of the two, neutral. A foundation with too much warmth for your skin can cause your face makeup to appear orange.

Madina Central hoping to perform well
Madina Central College Madawella is a school from Kandy District, housed at Bambarella Road, Madawala. It is 82 years old and gives a big hand for sports, mainly cricket, followed by athletics and football. They play their cricket big match against Al Azhar College Akurana, which is known as the Battle of the Double Maroons. It is the only big match between two Muslim schools in the country, which took off in the year 2008. It was stopped for a while due to a fight which occurred at the stadium when the match was in progress, and last year it was revived.
This school was founded by a revolutionary concept and a social worker, Abubakkar Lebbai Sayyadhu Mohammed on 2 December 1935, with 3 teachers and 36 students. A.K.Subramaniyam was the first principal and their first sport was athletics. It was a few years back they took to cricket.
Last year they gave their best despite playing in the lower division. This time they are all out to turn in a good performance.
This school has produced a top cricketer in M Siraj Sahab who won the Mobitel schoolboy cricketer in the silver division in 2014.
He is a right-arm speedster who played for Colts Cricket Club. In an under 23 inter provincial tournament, he was the fastest bowler putting fear into all the best batters, and had two five-wicket hauls and ended as the joint leading wicket taker in the tournament with 26 wickets from five games for Central Province XI helping the side to win U23 Champions trophy.
Once again the coaching department is handled by former Trinity College cricketer E. Mohammed Najime who is a qualified level I coach. He played for Kandy Youth SC, Madawela SC and Old Madina SC as a top all-rounder. He teaches the skills of cricket to individuals who have different abilities. He has the reputation of helping cricketers to reach their full potential. The school authorities, old boys of the school and parents of the cricketers believe he will be able to deliver this season. The MIC is Pasupathy Ganeshkumar who counts years of experience.
They are playing in the lower division and are all out to turn in a good performance, both with the bat and the ball.
This season promises to be an action packed season. However, its sad to say that last season they played only few games. Young cricketers after months of training had to be satisfied with few games.
This time they are pooled in the Division III. They are still to get the match schedule. This is how cricket is treated at the lower division. Who is to blame Cricket is a popular sport here in Kandy, especially at school level it is a great team sport and players do get popular.
This time the side is led by M.R.M. Thareef (captain), left-arm pace bowler and right-handed batsman. He played for Central Province team for two seasons. He was considered as the best bowler of the Prima Cup championship two years back. He says, the boys are really working hard for the coming season, there are four pace bowlers and same number of spinners, the batting line-up is also good. All players are in good form and the coach is giving his best along with the MIC. His deputy is M.I.M Munshif, an off-spinner and left hand batsman.
The rest of the players at practices are M.F.M. Fazal, M.F.I. Inshaf, N.M. Yazer, Z.M. Zaharan, I.M. Shafir, M.F.M. Munshif, M.F.M. Sahl, M.K. Haridh, I.M. Imas, F.M. Musharaf, A.J.M. Ajmal, N.M.

Much-awaited elections are here!: Decisive  days ahead
In what initially appeared to be a reversal of an earlier government decision, the government last week agreed to Local Government elections in January, after resolving some issues that had arisen over the creation of several new local government bodies, particularly in the Nuwara Eliya district.
Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government, Faiszer Mustapha was due to publish the gazette notification paving the way for the eagerly awaited elections this week, after which the Elections Commission was due to announce the date of the poll.
This would bring to an end weeks of speculation as to when elections to over 300 local government bodies countrywide would be held and lay to rest claims by the Opposition that the government was deliberately delaying polls because it was apprehensive about its standing with the electorate.
The latest developments emerged after a party leaders meeting last week, convened by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The Prime Minister was supportive of elections on the earliest available date, after making allowances for the Ordinary Level examination, which will be conducted in December.
Local Government elections
All three major contenders at the elections, the United National Party (UNP), the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the latter comprising mostly of the dissident faction of the SLFP supporting former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, are now hastily preparing for the polls.
Ironically, perhaps the party best prepared for the elections will be the SLPP. That is not to say that it is the most popular. However it could be the best organised to face the elections because it was always gearing itself for the Local Government elections, seeing these polls as a vital test of its grassroots level support base and seeking to project the party to the country through these elections.
Despite this, there were reports that there was an eleventh hour attempt to reconcile the two factions of the SLFP.
This move was being mooted by Minister of Technology and Research and former general secretary of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), Susil Premajayantha.
It will be recalled that during the August 2015 general election, Premajayantha, as general secretary of the UPFA found himself in a very difficult situation, when Rajapaksa loyalists were demanding nominations and loyalists of President Maithripala Sirisena was resisting these calls. After the election, Premajayantha was inducted into President Sirisenas Cabinet but lost his position as UPFA general secretary to Mahinda Amaraweera.
For some months now, Premajayantha, though being a senior minister, has been voicing dissenting views. When the controversy over the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) was being debated, Premajayantha openly defied the government, expressing solidarity with groups opposed to SAITM, much to the embarrassment of his Cabinet colleagues.
More recently, when maverick parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa stated that Parliament should be bombed if two-thirds of its members supported the draft Constitution and earned condemnation from many quarters including his own party, Premajayantha attempted to defend him, saying that what Weerawansa meant was that the draft Constitution should not be approved in its present form- and that he too agreed with that view.
SLFP factions
The latest and probably the very last move to unite the two factions of the SLFP is being undertaken by Premajayantha largely because a group which identifies itself as being independent- not formally aligned with either Rajapaksa or President Sirisena, but most of them holding office as ministers- fears the party would suffer if it went to the Local Government elections as a divided entity and face disastrous consequences.
Interestingly, neither President Sirisena nor former President Rajapaksa share this view. Both leaders are optimistic that they would fare well at the polls. Hence it is doubtful whether the efforts of Premajayantha will succeed.
In a further indication that attempts at reconciling the two factions of the SLFP might not be an exercise that yields a positive exercise, Deputy Minister of Posts and Postal Services, Duleep Wijesekera quit the government and sat on the Opposition benches on Monday.
Wijesekera, who represents the Gampaha district in Parliament, had already requested time to make a personal statement in Parliament and the political grapevine was abuzz with the news that he was about to defect to the Opposition. On Sunday, he was removed from his ministerial position by President Sirisena and he crossed over to the Opposition on Monday.
It is not only the SLFP that is going through a process of reorganisation, as Local Government elections loom on the horizon; the UNP too is restructuring its electoral network of organisers and a few changes came into effect on Monday, the most notable among them being the removal of popular actor turned politician Ranjan Ramanayake from the post of party organiser for the Divulapitiya electorate, also in the Gampaha district. Ramanayake was replaced by Kithsiri Manchanayake.
At the last general election, Ramanayake polled over 215,000 preference votes, the highest for the UNP in district, pushing hometown hero and cricketing celebrity Arjuna Ranatunga, who polled 165,000 votes into second place.
Ramanayake, a relative of actor turned politician Vijaya Kumaratunga, began his political career as electoral organiser for the Katana electorate and first entered Parliament in 2010 from the Ratnapura district. In Parliament, particularly in government, Ramanayake has been outspoken and has been controversial in his actions. Once, he earned the wrath of the public when he castigated an official publicly, invoking curses on her saying that lightning should strike her.
Nevertheless, partly because of his film star status and also because of his brazen, forthright approach to issues, he remains popular among the masses and it remains to be seen how he would react to his removal- and the impact this has on the party.
Other changes effected by the UNP are the appointments of Rosy Senanayake as organiser for Colombo East replacing lawyer Srinath Perera and the appointment of Hirunika Premachandra as organiser for Ratmalana.
Electoral system
While the appointment of Senanayake comes as no surprise, there is the likelihood of the former beauty queen and diplomat running for mayor in the Colombo Municipal Council. Premachandras appointment did raise eyebrows because she comes from a family with firm roots in the SLFP. However, still young and with a charismatic personality, her battles against former parliamentarian Duminda Silva have earned her a sizeable following and this latest move augurs well, both for Premachandra and the UNP. The SLPP meanwhile, nominally led by Basil Rajapaksa, is finalising its own plans for the Local Government elections. Rajapaksa is known for his skill in running election campaigns and his ability as a backroom negotiator, but this is the first instance where he is doing so from the ranks of the Opposition and, as Rajapaksa knows well, it is quite a different ball game when the resources of the state are not available- and are available to the government.
Ironically, with the governing parties- both the mainstream SLFP and the UNP- carrying the burdens of incumbency and the SLPP still being an unknown quantity with question marks hanging over the integrity of its leadership, it could have been the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) that emerged as an alternative.
However, the party, even under the leadership of Anura Kumara Dissanayake, appears to be clinging to archaic left of centre policies and has failed to capture the imagination of the masses. The change of the electoral system to a mix between the first past the post and proportional representation systems also hampers the partys chances to a significant extent. All in all, the next three months are likely to generate more political heat and debate, holiday season notwithstanding. Nevertheless, elections are a necessary evil in a democracy and for these particular elections, most will agree that it is better late than never.

NCHS holds third graduation ceremony
Private tertiary education has a vital role to play in educating Sri Lanka's youth. A variety of qualifications and exposure it provides would otherwise be unavailable to many Sri Lankans. Higher education is no longer optional for young people and meeting its growing demand is a challenge, said State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne, who was the chief guest at the Nawaloka College of Higher Studies aka (NCHS), third graduation held at Waters Edge.
The minister congratulated NCHS for making a good quality education available to more young people in the country.

Top awards were conferred with 15 in recognition of their academic prowess. It was a double celebration for NCHS, given the record number of 270 graduates being conferred with their qualifications, the highest since its inception.
NCHS offers diplomas in Business, IT, Engineering and Health Science and Foundation programs in Business Engineering, collaborating with SUT with a view to delivering excellence in education with the highest international standards, via modern state of the art learning facility.
SUT offering sixty bachelor degrees is ranked as one of the world's top 400 universities by the Academic Ranking of World Universities, confirming its place among the top three percent of universities in the world and top three universities in Melbourne.
Acting Australian High Commissioner Tim Huggins as the special guest and the Deputy Vice Chancellor of Swinburne University of Science and Technology David Coltman too graced the occasion.
David Coltman stated, At Swinburne we encourage our students to embrace the notion that we are all learners for life. Your graduation will not represent an end-point to your educational adventures.
NCHS Chairman Jayantha Dharmadasa said, We are proud to have been an active contributor to the country's knowledge based economic growth through our education system. At a time when there is a great demand for higher quality education which meets challenging global competition, NCHS has taken many steps towards fulfilling this macro national agenda.

New York truck attack: Trump calls for end of green card lottery
US President Donald Trump has called for the green card lottery to be scrapped, saying it allowed the New York truck attack suspect into the US.
In a series of tweets he called for the immigration programme to be replaced with a merit-based system.
Trump pinned blame for the scheme on Senator Chuck Schumer, who accused Trump of cutting anti-terror funding.
Authorities have not yet confirmed how the suspect in Tuesday's attack, Sayfullo Saipov, immigrated to the US.
Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning: "The terrorist came into our country through what is called the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program,' a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based.
He continued: "We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter)."
The US president also accused Senator Schumer, a New York Democrat, of "helping to import Europes [sic] problems".
What is the green card lottery
The diversity visa lottery programme , also known as the green card lottery, grants permanent US residency every year to around 50,000 immigrants.
Schumer did play a key role in crafting the legislation creating the lottery system in 1990.
It was passed in a cross-party vote and signed into law by a Republican President, George HW Bush.
But as Republican Senator Jeff Flake points out, Schumer led a 2013 bipartisan immigration bill that proposed scrapping the green card lottery altogether.
The legislation would have transferred the permanent residency quota currently assigned to the green card lottery to immigrants with advanced skills.
The immigration bill passed the Senate but did not become law because it died in the House of Representatives.
What's Trump's immigration reform plan
Trump said in the aftermath of Tuesday's attack he was ordering the Department of Homeland Security "to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program", without elaborating.
The US leader said he wanted "extreme vetting" of immigrants during his presidential campaign last August.
As president, he introduced a ban on arrivals to the US from a number of mainly-Muslim countries - a move that has been challenged legally and is due before the Supreme Court in the coming weeks.
The American Civil Liberties Union civil rights group said the term extreme vetting was a "euphemism for discriminating against Muslims".
Trump has also endorsed a bill by two Republican senators that would eliminate the lottery-based system.
The Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment (Raise) Act was introduced in February, but has failed to attract the votes needed to pass the Senate.
It would also halve the number of legal immigrants to the US and cap the number of refugees.
