KANDY SPORTS ROUNDUP : Kandy Schools Bash 2016
The Kandy Schools Bash, the annual family sports and social get-together, which is organized by the Kandy Students Past Pupils Association (KSPPA) will be held at the CR&FC grounds Longden Place on August 27 (Saturday).

The first Kandy Bash was held in 2007, since then it has been an annual event.
Senaka coach, Deshan captain
Dharmaraja College will be once again be coached by one of their products and the first double centurion of the school Senaka Dissanayake, a well-known figure in the cricketing field.

This year the Rajans are being led by a fine one down bat, Deshan Gunasinghe, a technically correct stroke maker. Last season he did well with the bat and is a batsman who can attack any type of bowling and a fine fielder.

The defending champions are St. Anthonys College with Science College as number two.
Only 2 A division schools from Kandy
With Kandy Sports Club dominating rugby in the country, Kandy schools failed to do well last season, only two teams have now qualified to play in the next A division, Trinity and St. Anthonys. Schools like Kingswood, Vidyartha, Dharmaraja and St. Sylvesters are in the lower division. Where has things gone gone wrong for the other schools Today more than any sport rugby has a good following, at school level it is the biggest spectator game. Rugby is one of the most popular ball games in schools, but today most of the schools are finding it difficult to keep it going. The Schools Rugby Association has apparently no control and it has become necessary for the Education Ministry to step into the scrum.

Lankan-born Aussie in the news for the wrong reasons
RIO DE JANEIRO, Thursday: A Sri Lanka-born badminton player, representing Australia in the current 2016 Olympic Games in Rio, hit news headlines in a different sport. Sawan Serasinghe, born on February 21, 1994 in Galle and now residing in Melbourne, Australia is representing his adopted country at the Rio 2016 Olympics.
Serasinghe is partnered by Matthew Chau in representing Australia in the mens doubles tournament here. They were drawn in group A but the Australian duo lost all their three qualifying round group matches. They first lost to South Koreas Yong Dae Lee and Yeon Seong Yoo 14-21, 16-21.
The second group match for the Serasinghe-Chau combination was against Vladimir Ivanov and Ivan Sozoniv. But the Russian duo had an easy straight set win 21-16, 21-16. Serasinghe and Chau fared no better in their last group match too and suffered their third successive defeat at the hands of Sheng Mu Lee and Chia Hsin Tsai of Taipei 14-21, 19-21.
It was only in the last set of their last group match that Serasinghe and Chau could offer some resistance before going down fighting.
However, Serasinghe hit news headlines for a different reason  enjoying a mammoth meal from the fast food giant McDonalds outlet in the Olympic Village which offers free meals to competitors and officials residing there.
Since the sportsmen and women in the Olympic Village have been ordering ridiculous amounts of food from the outlet, the free restaurant finally decided to limit an order to 20 items per person at a time.
Reports said that the limitation on food item orders has been imposed with a view of reducing the time the competitors have to spend in its waiting line.
Some competitors have been forced to wait for hours to place their order due to a huge demand and gigantic orders placed by most Olympians.
The Washington Post and Britains Daily Mail carried banner headlines on the restrictions imposed by the food outlet to cut down the time athletes have to wait before they collect their food. In one such report, a big photograph showing Serasinghe before a huge food order was published with a caption Australian badminton player Sawan Serasinghe takes advantage of the restaurants generosity with a mammoth order.
The Indian Express headline said that Australian Olympian Serasinghe celebrated his exit from the Rio Games with a mighty McDonalds feast.
It claimed that Serasinghe had ordered some six packs of large fries, six brownies, two hamburgers, three McChickens, a Big Mac, 40 McNuggets and some water to be precise.
Serasinghes photograph was not the only one that was published along with the news reports which highlighted images of long queues of Olympians waiting for their turn in front of the restaurant which served fast food round the clock with a highly efficient staff who work like robots.
In contrast, there were hardly any rush at the main restaurant of the Olympic Village which too offers free food for competitors and officials.
Although the main restaurant offers a balanced and health-conscious diet for sportsmen with a variety of other favourite food served in each continent, most Olympians opt for the fast food restaurant located in the international zone of the Olympic Village.
Serasinghes photograph which the newspapers have published originally appeared in the shuttlers Instegram account.
Reports said that free fast food has been like a red rag to a bull to some athletes, adding that Serasinghe is a prime example - posting a picture of his king-sized order.
Some sportsmen see the free food as a release from months of hard work and Serasinghe has captioned his Integram picture Now its time to eat some junk food after months of eating clean. Serasinghe is not the only Australian who patronizes the outlet and his team mate and basketball superstar Andrew Bogut has eaten there. Among the other high-profile sportsmen and women who have made use of the fast food outlet is former world number one, Jelena Jankovic.

SLT Speedup Tour - the beginning of a new era for cycling
Seated with Sri Lanka Telecoms Chief Marketing Officer, Ajantha Seneviratne, it is not difficult to recognize the glow of pride as he describes the post-event results of the SLT Speedup Sawariya, which came to an end on the July 31 at the Municipal Grounds in Batticaloa.
This has been a new and unique experience for all of us at SLT and the feedback we have received following the conclusion of the event has been indescribably positive. It is my belief that value to the sport came not from the value of the prizes or the length of the race, but rather the recognition gained by the cyclists. The skill, dedication and teamwork of the cyclists was truly admirable and the enthusiasm shown by the masses was most encouraging, both to the organizers as well as the participants. This is one of the main reasons why we are determined to take cycling well beyond what was experienced at the SLT Speedup Sawariya.
As a company we plan to continue supporting the sport by taking the lead and joining hands with other corporates to aid in the training of cyclists by providing them with modern facilities and the latest technology. It is our intention to bring in the use of telecommunication as a means of tracking the progress of each cyclist during the race. We at SLT believe that the right mix of technology will help raise the standard of cycling to be worthy of recognition on the international racetrack. 
Seneviratne was not the only one glowing with pride following the SLT Speedup Sawariya. The three winners of the mens race shared their views and experiences in a recent interview.
My career just enjoyed a winning start- Overall Champion, Darshana Prasad of the Sri Lanka Navy
Question: How did you feel when you first heard about the SLT Speedup Sawariya
I was really happy and very eager to compete. I knew
that it was going to be a massive event in the country and considered a blessing for all cyclists.
Question: Did you expect to win the competition
Well, it was my dream but I had never won an overall title in my professional career before, so it was a huge moment for me as I rode past some of the favorites to win the overall title in countrys biggest cycle race ever.
Question: How did you prepare for the event
A lot of hard work went in in to preparation. It was a five-day event and I am happy I managed to reap the fruits of my hard work and commitment.
Question: Do you think the SLT Speedup Sawariya is a turning point for cycling in Sri Lanka
Yes, this is a big turning point in our history. I am grateful to SLT for organizing this event and for their generous contributions. Sports need such generous patrons to prosper and SLT has just given the sport of cycling the boost it has long been waiting for. I hope we can take it from here and develop it further.
A high standard was maintained throughout the race- Charith Fernando of the Sri Lanka Army, First Runner-Up of the SLT Speedup Sawariya
Question: What were your expectations at the start of the five-day race
Like everyone else, it was my dream to win it. I represented the Sri Lanka Army, so we were keen to make the Army proud as well.
Question: How do you compare this race with other races you have competed in before
To be honest, the organizational aspect of the game was at a very high level. The riders never had any issues as everything was perfectly in place for them to perform. I think they maintained the high standard, usually followed in international races.
Question: How has the response been following your impressive performance, where you finished second in the race
This event attracted lots of publicity from the outset, which is a very good thing.
A lot had been done to gain public support for the race. I am actually getting overwhelming responses from fans.
Question: What kind of impact has the SLT Speedup Sawariya brought to your professional riding career
I represent the Sri Lanka Army. Our main aim is to win as much races as possible to keep Army flag flying high while improving our own performances. So I believe this was the best opportunity weve had in the recent past to realize our goals.
Sri Lanka has great potential to take cycling to the next level - Jeewan Jayasinghe of the Sri Lanka Air Force, Second Runner-Up of the SLT Speedup Sawariya
Question: You are the fastest cyclist in South Asia. I am sure you expected much more than what you got at the end of the five-day event
Yes, certainly. I expected to win. But I am happy that we managed to win the team title for the Air Force.
Question: How excited were you to compete in this historical cycling event
I was very anxious to be honest. Not very often do we get races of this magnitude. Like everyone else, I was looking forward to the event and to putting in my best effort to secure a win. We have lots of potential in this country and this race proved that.
Question: As a professional rider, how do you feel about the SLT Speedup Sawariya
I have competed in local and international races and this was certainly conducted according to international standards. If we can continue to organize races such as this, it will definitely help to take the sport to the next level.
Question: Whats your assessment of the race and its impact on the sport in Sri Lanka
This was such a huge event. There was lots of publicity for the event and it was clear that a lot of effort had gone into planning it. Like I said before we need to organize races like this more often to help the sport reach the next level.

## Title: REVIEW OF SRI LANKA-AUSTRALIA TEST SERIES: When the Lion roared and the Kangaroo cowed
## Supertitle:

REVIEW OF SRI LANKA-AUSTRALIA TEST SERIES: When the Lion roared and the Kangaroo cowed
For any country beating Australia is considered a great achievement because they have been the benchmark of what international cricket should be for many years. Although many players have retired through the years Australia have through their strong first-class domestic system found replacements good enough to keep them on top of world cricket in Tests and One-Day Internationals.
When Steve Smiths Australians arrived in Sri Lanka for a lengthy two-month tour they were heralded as the number one Test team and were awarded the Test mace by the ICC shortly before the commencement of the three-Test series. The Australians were determined to set straight their poor record in the subcontinent where they had lost 0-4 in India and 0-2 to Pakistan in UAE previously. So single-minded were they that they came a fortnight ahead of the tour proper to commence their preparations for the series against Sri Lanka to accustom themselves to the heat, humidity and the turning pitches they would encounter during the tour. According to Smith and the team management they had done everything they thought was right to prepare themselves for the series ahead.
Sri Lanka on the other hand was coming from a bad tour of England where they had lost the three-Test series 0-2, the ODI series 0-3 as well as the one-off T20I. Things were not looking rosy for Angelo Mathews and his men when the Australian Test series began at Pallekele.
The worst fears were rekindled when Sri Lanka winning the toss and batting first were bundled out for 117 in their first innings. Was this going to be another nightmare series as in England Australia gained a first innings advantage of 86 and when Sri Lanka lost four wickets for 86 in their second innings, the writing seemed to be on the wall for another disastrous series.
Sri Lanka needed someone to rescue them from this terrible trend that was following them. Then from nowhere emerged a young lad of 21 by the name of Kusal Mendis who was to be the savior of Sri Lanka cricket and perhaps its future. Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Mendis who had shown a lot of promise in the few Tests he had played at the highest level eventually made it big when his country needs him most. He played an innings out of this world  176 when only one other batsman made a fifty in the Test to wrest the initiative away from Australia. That innings of Mendis proved to be the cornerstone of Sri Lanka going ahead and beating the Aussies 3-0 in the series to record their fourth white-wash of a Test side after Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and West Indies and laying their hands on the Warne-Muralithran trophy for the first time.
Stunned by this amazing knock of Mendis, the Australians who had 268 to chase and win at Pallekele succumbed for 161 to hand out a 106-run win for Sri Lanka. It was just the antidote that Sri Lanka needed to turn the corner and from there onwards it was more of a roller-coaster ride to winning the Test series.
What is pertinent to mention here is that it was not one player who took the limelight during the series because in each of the remaining two Tests there was someone who put their hand up to pull the side out of trouble. At Galle it was Dilruwan Pereras fine all-round contribution (64 and 10/99) that contributed towards the 229-run win and at the SSC it was another youngster Dhananjaya de Silva who shone. De Silvas maiden Test hundred was scored at a time when Sri Lanka was reeling at 26-5 in the first innings. With Dinesh Chandimal who also made a hundred, De Silva put on a record 211 runs for the sixth wicket that gave Sri Lanka a decent total of 355 to defend. De Silva then followed his first innings 129 with another fine knock of 65 not out that enabled his team to set Australia with a tall target of 324 to chase on a difficult pitch. What was so impressive about De Silvas batting was his cool composure at the wicket and the amount of time he has to play his shots  hallmarks of a great cricketer in the making.
There were also others who made their mark during the series like Lakshan Sandakan, who bowls left-arm chinaman and took seven wickets on his debut and the two experienced campaigners Rangana Herath and Kaushal Silva. Herath has proved time and again that he is one of the best left-arm spinners in the world and in this series his accurate bowling and deft change of pace and flight proved too much for the hapless Australians who had no clue how to tackle the spin and the skid that subcontinent pitches generate.
As Smith admitted that on Australian pitches the ball would only bounce and spin but here it was different. The biggest problem for the Australians was the skidding ball which neither their batsmen nor their bowlers were able to master.
Herath proved a handful with a handsome pile up 28 wickets (that included a hat-trick), the second most in a series for Sri Lanka after Muthiah Muralitharans 30 against Zimbabwe in 2001-02. He was not only a thorn in the Australian side with his bowling but also with his brave batting. The off-spin of Dilruwan Perera proved an ideal foil to Herath. Overall the Lankan spinners domination of the series was quite apparent with 54 of the 58 wickets being taken by them. Sri Lanka used their fast bowlers only for 37 overs for the entire series.
In a way as Mathews admitted the injury to Suranga Lakmal proved a blessing in disguise at Pallekele for had he come through a fitness test Sri Lanka wouldnt have debuted young spinner Sandakan and who knows the series may have ended differently.
A word of praise for the team management and the national selectors for keeping faith in the two openers despite their constant failures and for the faith coach Graham Ford had in the team. Although Dimuth Karunaratne failed to make it big, his partner Kaushal Silva came good on his home ground at the SSC to carve out a century one which he described as possible because of the stitches to his left webbing that prevented him from driving and chasing balls outside the off stump that had led to his downfall.
If at all Australia had a hero on what turned out to be a nightmare series for them it was the magnificent bowling of Mitchell Starc who under conditions not favourable for fast bowling was the standout bowler apart from Herath in the series. His 24 wickets in the series is testimony to hard work and discipline and if Australia could have put more runs on the board his bowling would have made the difference between victory and defeat.

WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY ABOUT OUR CRUSHING WIN OVER AUSTRALIA
Roshan Mahanama (former Sri Lanka Test cricketer and ICC Match Referee)
We have shown the world what we can do. Its a clear indication that we cannot be taken lightly and that we cannot be just written off. Its a young team and to beat the Aussies in this manner is a great achievement. It is also good for the Aussies to have a taste of their own medicine. We dont one or two teams dominating cricket and this win by Sri Lanka is good for the sport and makes the competition healthy. No one expected this young inexperienced side to turn things around like this I am very proud of them.
Michael Tissera (former Sri Lanka captain and manager)
It is quite an unbelievable performance. To tell you quite frankly I didnt expect this result. The fellows have played brilliantly and a lot of the credit should go to Kusal Mendis for his 176 that turned the whole series. In that game nobody else got a fifty on either side from thereon we just took the upper hand and our fellows bowled brilliantly I thought. Great win. I have never seen an Australian or any international side who was so bad against spin they just didnt have a clue. It will take another year or so we cant judge the team just on this series they are going to South Africa well see how they fare there, but I feel that a lot of the youngsters have the talent if they are handled properly. In a years time we should be a very good side.
Ana Punchihewa (former SLC president when Sri Lanka won 1996 World Cup)
The best performance we had in Test match, the first was when we won a Test abroad. This win should rank among our top three. At least we showed we have come to the party at last. We have shown we have the talent and with our under 19 cricketers also performing well in England at least we have made the pathway to get there. Its a great performance and all credit should go to the cricketers who performed under difficult circumstances, hats off to them and the SLC officials.
Lalith Kaluperuma (former Sri Lanka Test cricketer and selector)
Its a great win. To beat the world number one side is one helluva achievement. We were in bad positions several times but we managed to overcome them. That shows the talent of our cricketers. Good to see the youngsters improving fast and displaying their talents in difficult conditions. The standout players for me were Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva with Rangana Herath bowling superbly at this age, his main weapon was his accuracy.
David Heyn (former Sri Lanka cricketer)
The guy who impressed me most was Dhananjaya (de Silva) he was fantastic a 24-year-old he was sort of not concentrating fully on his debut in Pallekele and where he came to the fore was at the SSC. He seems to have so much time he doesnt sort of go right forward but waits for the ball. With Kusal Mendis, Chandimal coming through, Angelo can always get runs and with Dhananjaya and Kusal Perera we got a good batting line up with the two openers which is something they got to look and a very good side to go forward on subcontinent wickets can give India, Pakistan and Bangladesh a bloody good run. Good test to see how they perform in Australia and South Africa. The first test for this new side will be in South Africa. I am highly impressed with all those guys. It was not impossible conditions we had if you go through the past Australian sides they have performed well in Sri Lanka we had other sides also doing well. In a nutshell this Australian side did not have a good enough technique to play spin.
Ranjith Fernando (former Sri Lanka cricketer, manager and commentator)
To me it was either our best effort as a team if not the best no question about it. Absolutely over the moon with the way the young fellows have not only performed but I found that guys like Dhananjaya and Kusal Mendis they have a type of swagger of their own and there is an air of confidence I havent seen in a lot of players in a long time. The main thing is that Sri Lankas domestic cricket is not dead and our under 19 cricket has not deteriorated as a lot of people have been saying. These fellows have come through the under 19 system. To me Australia is not that they cant play spin but they have ingrained in them over the years that they cant play spin and now they have come to a stage that they really cannot play spin. They dont have the confidence. This is the same things that people our saying about our cricket. Once people start believing it, to get them out of it is very difficult. Next year is going to be the tough years because the opposition will get to know the newcomers but this performance is absolutely brilliant no question about it. I am sort of short for words to describe it. Credit should go to Mathews and also coach Graham Ford.

President threatens to reveal political secrets if new party is formed
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday warned the rebels that he will show no hesitation in bringing to light political secrets which were kept under raps hitherto, if moves are made to form a new political party in the country.
We will create an atmosphere for them to wander in the streets, if they form a new political party, the President said.
President Sirisena added that he will not allow them to form a government forever and will let out all secrets if a new political party is formed.
Some elements who identify themselves as patriots are dreaming of forming a new government overthrowing the unity government. Their attempts will never come to a reality as this government is in power for five years for the well being of the public," he said.
President Sirisena was addressing a massive public rally at the Sanath Jayasuriya grounds in Matara to mark the first anniversary of the Good Governance government.
Those who crowned corruption and fraud will not be allowed to come into power again, the President stressed.
President Sirisena said he and the government of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are committed to protect this country more than those who identify themselves as patriots.
We will never give into the pressure of foreign powers and we will not let any country to interfere with our internal affairs," the President said.
He said the unity government led by him and the Prime Minister was able to reestablish the lost international recognition.
We have initiated a number of strategies to rescue the country from the vast economic crisis created by the previous regime," President Sirisena said.
The President added that certain quarters in the country query about the achievements made by the government during the last one year.
Our biggest achievement as a government was to re-establish the lost democracy and freedom in the country and winning the trust of the international community, he said.
President Sirisena said the country faced an economic down turn due to enormous loans obtained by the previous government.

Why stepmotherly treatment for Jana Satana Paada Yatra, asks Dullas
The silence of the Police on the one year celebration of the National government held at the vicinity of three leading schools where the GCE (A/L) examination is held is highly questionable as it went before Court on eight occasions against the Jana Satana Paada Yatra since its commencement, UPFA Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma said yesterday.
Alahapperuma said the procession to mark the celebration was to march opposite two schools while the GCE (A/L) examination was in progress.
He said Servatius College, St. Mary's College and President College in Matara are within a 200 m radius of the Sanath Jayasuriya Stadium in Matara where the celebrations was to be held.
Alahapperuma made these observations at a press conference at former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's Political Office in Battaramulla, Colombo, yesterday morning.
He said Rajapaksa instructed them to organise the Jana Satana Pada Yatra avoiding the day that the grade five scholarship examination was held.
The MP said 68 buses had been taken from the Matara bus depot causing severe difficulties to the students sitting the GCE (A/L) examination.
During the last one year and seven months, two electoral organisers of Matara district have been removed without any reason which is a grave injustice, Alahapperuma said.
This is done on the agenda of the UNP and in protest of these decisions I resigned from my post of the district leadership,  he said. "The ceremony is held in Matara and the venue was selected by the UNP. The main reason to hold it in Matara was the district that defeated the national government concept at the last election, Alahapperuma said.
We are taking the SLFP policies forward and if someone says we are not, we ask them to read S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike's speech in Parliament in 1951 after quitting the UNP and also establishing the SLFP, the MP said.
Opposition MP Pavitra Wanniarachchi said even her parents were SLFPers and they love the party.
She said their objective was to set up a SLFP government and they would do it within two years.
Opposition MPs Prasanna Ranatunga and Rohitha Abeygunawardena also spoke.

Brilliant Bolt storms to third 200 gold
RIO DE JANEIRO, FRIDAY: Usain Bolt wrote another chapter of improbable Olympic history with a third consecutive 200m crown on Thursday as Ashton Eaton led an American gold rush by clinching back-to-back decathlon titles.
Bolt, who just days earlier had become the first man in history to win three 100m titles in a row, surged to victory in the 200m in 19.78sec at the Olympic Stadium.
Canada's Andre De Grasse took silver in 20.02sec, just ahead of France's Christophe Lemaitre, who took bronze in 20.12.
Bolt's triumph was greeted with rapturous applause by Brazilian fans who roared their appreciation as the sprint superstar set off on a lap of honour, with Bob Marley booming from stadium speakers.
The win left the 29-year-old Bolt just one win away from his targeted triple triple -- a repeat of his sweep of 100m, 200m and 4x100m golds at the 2008 and 2012 Games.
There's nothing else I can do, said Bolt.
I've proven to the world that I'm the greatest. That's what I came here for. This is why I said it's my last Olympics. I can't prove anything else.
The only blemish on another night of triumph for Bolt -- his eighth Olympic gold medal -- was a failure to seriously challenge his world record of 19.19sec. I wanted to run a faster time, he said. I knew it was going to be hard to break the world record because I could tell by my legs.
When I came off the corner my legs decided, Listen, we're not going to go any faster.'
Bolt will attempt to put the seal on what he says is his final Olympics in Friday's 4x100 relay.
US gold rush 
Bolt's win came on a day when US athletes snapped up four more golds with wins in decathlon, men's and women's 400m hurdles and shot put.
Eaton, the defending decathlon champion and world record holder, overcame a fierce challenge from France's Kevin Mayer to win the punishing 10-event discipline with a total of 8,893 points.
Mayer won silver with a total of 8,834pts, with Canada's Damian Warner taking bronze.
Eaton's back-to-back titles matched Britain's Daley Thompson, who won gold in the event in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics.
To win two Olympic golds in a row like Daley Thompson is very special, Eaton said.
One day, I'm going to have to meet Daley, shake his hand and thank him for giving me something to chase after.
Arguably the performance of the day by a US athlete came in the women's 400m hurdles, where Dalilah Muhammad became the first American to win the event since it was introduced at the 1984 Olympics.
Being the first American to win this title adds a bit of extra sparkle, added Muhammad, who finished in 53.13sec.
Sara Slott Petersen of Denmark took silver in 53.55sec while Muhammad's team-mate Ashley Spencer claimed bronze in 53.72.
Solo relay replay 
Kerron Clement had earlier launched the US gold blitz in the men's 400m hurdles, coming home in 47.73 to claim gold from Kenya's Boniface Tumuti.
Clement, who won silver in the event in the 2008 Olympics, said he had been determined to win gold this year after injuries derailed his 2012 Games.
I had one goal in mind and my mindset was to come here and get a medal, Clement said.
The other American gold came in the shot put, where Ryan Crouser won with a best of 22.52 metres, a new Olympic record.
Crouser's teammate and reigning world champion Joe Kovacs claimed silver with 21.78m. New Zealand's Tomas Walsh took bronze (21.36).
Elsewhere Thursday, the USA's 4x100m women's relay team survived a potentially costly dropped baton blunder in their heat that left them facing disqualification.
The Americans however were granted a reprieve when race officials found that runner Allyson Felix had been barged by a Brazilian rival.
The US quartet were then ordered to return to the track to run a solo time trial in order to qualify for Friday's final, which they duly did with a fastest time of 41.77sec.
It was different, it was really weird, Felix said after the unprecedented solo race. Running without competition is just strange. AFP

Jayawardene's ton takes Somerset to semi-finals
Former Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene played another silky innings to relish at Taunton to guide Somerset to an away tie against Warwickshire in the semi-final of the RL Cup on Thursday.
Jayawardene made a delightful unbeaten 117 in 111 balls to help Somerset to 214-1 chasing Worcestershires total of 210.
With Jim Allenby who made 81, Jayawardene posted an opening stand of 188 off 33.1 overs to set the county on course for victory.
Jayawardene has had a largely unproductive spell at Somerset this season - his previous best since joining the county for the NatWest T20 Blast being 55 - but a selection of easeful glides and a couple of gentle straight sixes against the spinners were a reminder of his class. Presented with a chance to depart with smiles all round, he took it. It would have been rude not to.
Somerset now faces the prospect of having to play their semi-final without Jayawardene. I think the semi is going to be tight, he said. I have already moved a few things around to play today, but prior commitments at home mean I have to go back now. Even this match was a bit of an extension but I have had a great time here and if they get to the final I might be able to make the trip.
It was Somerset's seventh win in the competition this season after waltzing through their group.
Scores: Worcestershire 210 in 42.5 overs (Moeen Ali 81, D Mitchell 64, P Trego 3/33)
Somerset 214-1 in 36.5 overs (M Jayawardene 117 n.o., J Allenby 81)

Former SA cricketer bags silver in javelin at Olympics
Former South Africa Women allrounder Sunnette Viljoen, who has played one Test and 17 ODIs, created history on Thursday by bagging a silver medal in the women's javelin final of the Rio Olympics.
Viljoen, 33, finished second behind Croatia's Sara Kolak, with her best throw of 64.92 metres compared to Kolak's 66.18 metres. Viljoen's medal was the ninth for South Africa who are currently placed 34th overall with one gold, six silvers and two bronze medals.
She had come agonisingly close to winning a medal at the London 2012 Olympics but finished fourth with a best throw of 64.53 metres, behind Germany's Linda Stahl, who finished third with 64.91.
Viljoen played her only Test against India in March 2002 in Paarl, scoring 17 and 71. She had made her ODI debut in 2000 and finished her ODI career two years later with 198 runs and five wickets.

New Zealand bowlers take control in first Test
New Zealand's bowlers held the advantage on the first day of the first Test against South Africa at Kingsmead on Friday.
South Africa struggled to 236 for eight at the close of play after deciding to bat in overcast conditions, with the floodlights on for most of the day.
Left-arm opening bowler Trent Boult struck two telling blows, making the first breakthrough when he had Stephen Cook caught behind for 20, then dismissing top-scorer Hashim Amla for 53.
Fellow left-arm seamer Neil Wagner finished the day with the best figures of three for 47, while left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner halted a promising fightback by South Africa when he dismissed Quinton de Kock and Temba Bavuma in the space of three balls.
Batting was never easy on a slow but well-grassed pitch, with Boult in particular getting the ball to swing and seam.
Cook got a faint edge to a ball which straightened off the surface after several other deliveries had swung in to the right-hander.
Amla, by contrast, was caught behind off an inside edge when a ball swung in to him.South African-educated Wagner used the short ball effectively, having JP Duminy caught at fine leg off an ill-judged pull shot.
Wagner then dismissed former schoolmate Faf du Plessis with the help of a spectacular diving catch at gully by New Zealand captain Kane Williamson.
Du Plessis, standing in as South African captain for the injured AB de Villiers, made 23 in an 84-ball vigil.
Bavuma and De Kock both batted positively in adding 48 for the sixth wicket. De Kock made 33 runs off 33 balls before going down the wicket to try to hit Santner for a third successive boundary, lofting a catch to wide mid-off. AFP

Dullas resigns from Matara district leadership post
UPFA Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma said that he would resign from the post of Matara District Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) leadership from today. Addressing a press conference at the political office of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in Battaramulla, Colombo yesterday, Alahapperuma said that he would send his resignation to the SLFP General Secretary and Party leader President Maithripala Sirisena.
The former minister said that he decided to resign from his party position as the party has decided to remove all electoral organisers of the Matara district who were elected at the election. He also said that so far no reasons have been given to the party organisers removed for their position.
Alahapperuma added it was a grave injustice.
He also said that those SLFP electoral organisers who had been removed by the party leadership are those who have a massive vote base whereas their successors had a poor vote base.
These decisions are not taken to strengthen the SLFP but to dilute it, MP Alahapperuma said. We act as a team to protect the SLFP and we knew the repercusions we had to face. Whatever actions they take, we will not hesitate to take the required action to protect the SLFP,.Alahapperuma added.

Plans to bring UNP supporters for SLFP Convention: MR
Plans are underway to bring UNP supporters to the 65th Convention of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party to be held in Kurunegala on September 4 to show that the people are still with the SLFP leadership, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
The former President said the removal of electoral organisers is aimed at the voters of the party and not the electoral organisers.
This is an attempt to take revenge from the people who voted for the SLFPs victory, he said.
Rajapaksa said that appointing a group of people who are less popular among the people and who are supportive of the UNP will help ruin the party.
I have not made any decision about participating in this convention.
I will take a decision after consulting Joint Opposition Parliamentarians and Local Government representatives,he said.
Meanwhile, Kandy district parliamentarian Dilum Amunugama yesterday said that all Joint Opposition Parliamentarians will join in the partys 65th Convention, if SLFP Parliamentarians are ready to vacate their portfolios in the present government.
We are not in a position to participate in this convention, if SLFP Parliamentarians holding various portfolios in the government are not prepared to vacate their portfolios forthwith,he said.
Addressing a press conference in Kandy, Amunugama said that attempts to bring JO Parliamentarians to the convention is futile, when members of the Joint Opposition are being targeted by the government.
Amunugama said the SLFP is removing its electoral organisers who are more popular in their districts on the recommendation of United National Party.

Dullas resigning from posts, a common occurrence - Weerakkody
Commenting on the decision taken by Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma to resign from the SLFP Matara District leadership post, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said that this was not the first occasion he had done so as even in 2001 did so when the SLFP was in trouble.
He made this observation responding a question raised by a journalist at a media conference held yesterday at the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry.
The minister said that he had not yet resigned from the post and there was a possibility of changing his decision within the next few days.
This is not the first time he acted like this. When the party was in a crisis situation in 2001, he left the party and flew to America after appearing for a UNP advertisement which claimed that Sri Lanka was not a good place to live in. It is some what suspicious as to whether he had once again received an invitation from USA, the minister said.
Minister Weerakkody said that measures were taken to hold the 65th anniversary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in Kurunegala on the 4th of next month on a grand scale. The members of the SLFP have already taken measures to make all grass root level SLFP supporters aware about the convention and there was a good response from them and they were ready to join us to strengthen the SLFP, he said.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist with regard to the appointment of the former Hambantota Mayor, a person with a bad history as an electoral organizer, Minister Weerakkody said that he had been given a four year period prior to the next general election to do politics in a democratic manner.
