India biggest buyer for SL handlooms
After nearly two decades of continued battle for its survival, the handloom sector of Sri Lanka has finally turned around.
The handloom sector of Sri Lanka faced a setback and declined. However, several government initiatives have successfully revived the sector.
Today, many Lankan handloom makers are reaping good profits said the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen addressing the inauguration of the annual handloom expo and awards event Ran Salu.
The event also witnessed the issuance of a postal stamp by the Postal Department of Sri Lanka commemorating celebrating the 105 year anniversary of the Handloom Textile Training Centre in Rajagiriya . The handloom sector of Sri Lanka faced a setback and declined, starting from 1990s. However, several government initiatives have successfully revived the sector.
Today many Lankan handloom makers are reaping good profits.
I am pleased to say that at present, all handloom products made in Sri Lanka are selling fast, and we are unable to meet the demand.
Most sales revenues are from the Sri Lankan buyers and the rest of revenues are from tourists said Minister Bathiudeen.
Sri Lankan handlooms are also exported now-India being the largest buyer. Most Lankan handloom makers are in the East. Among the other leading provinces for handlooms are central and Southern.
Over 70% of handloom makers are women and therefore strengthening this sector is a way to empower rural women. This sector is also a contributor to governments self-employment creation plans.
We are working on establishing a handloom dye and colour centre in the North Central Province with latest technology. Still, it is important for the sector to recognize excellence. After ten years, we have sent Sri Lankan handloom makers to overseas training.
Minister Batiudeen also felicitated Ms Chandani Thenuwara-a veteran of Sri Lankan handlooms and who formerly served at the Textiles Department.
My biggest contribution to Lankan handlooms is introduction of shaded colouring technology to the fabrics which was not possible in pre-1970s said a jubilant Ms Thenuwara.

Lanka yet to fully exploit ornamental fish exports
Sri Lanka is yet to reap full financial benefits from ornamental fish exports, said Director, Lumbini Fish Exports International, Vibhu V. Perera.
He said that only few know that Sri Lanka is the largest guppy fish exporter to the world and is among the top 10 exporters of ornamental fish.
However, if given the proper guidance by the government, Sri Lanka can be among the top five exporters, he said. Currently, Sri Lanka exports ornamental fish to around 50 countries and the annual turnover is less than US$ 3 million. However, there is an annual growth of around 10% and more Lankan companies are moving to export.
Speaking at a workshop on Prevention of Diseases in Ornamental Fish in Sri Lanka organized by Lumbini Aquatic Resources Conservation (LARC), he said that if the government gives proper guidance and assistance, Sri Lanka can easily double the export revenue in a few years. The workshop was conducted by Dr. Gerald Bassleer from the Netherlands, who is a highly acclaimed fish pathologist and possesses over 40 years of experience in the industry.
He said Sri Lankan exporters comply with all EU regulations and hence there is tremendous value for Lankan fish. We must also emphasize that in contrast Malaysian bred carps are not being accepted in some parts of the world since they have issues of standard with the EU.
He said that Lumbini was the first aquarium in Sri Lanka to be set up in 1952 and today is the largest ornamental fish exporter and has several breeding sites and also an outgrower system. In our business of exporting live aquatic products, taking care of the delicate aquatic lives from the time of harvest to the shipment is of vital importance in order to retain the quality of the products. Fish can experience stress and trauma during harvest, storage in aquaria and shipment and we educate those in the industry on the importance of adopting sustainable practices all the time to minimize the damage to the aquatic living beings.
He also they are not allowed to catch fresh water fish in Sri Lanka and breed them under recent legal regulations. However, other countries that imported Sri Lankan fish varieties before the ban have now bred them and are re-exporting them.

World acclaims Sri Lankas judicial independence
Convincing the international community that Sri Lanka did not need foreign judges is a victory to the independence of judiciary, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He was addressing the gathering at the annual conference and workshop of the judges yesterday at the Galadari Hotel, Colombo.
The President said he believed in the unbiased judicial process of Sri Lanka.
He said he attended the annual conference of the Sri Lanka Judges' Institute for three consecutive years and it helped him to address their problems easily. The President said discussions were being held with relevant authorities to increase judges' salaries and they were satisfactory.
Nearly 90 percent of the issue lies in the system and that needs to be addressed. The people have lost trust in judiciary and it is one of our primary concerns. We need to march forward by resolving the issues while ensuring that we have an independent judiciary, he said. The President noted that the judges were able to deliver judgements independently and a judicial-friendly background was created in the last three years.
He said a report submitted by a group of United Nations officials on judiciary suggested that the system should be improved and their main concern was language
"All the people do not speak Tamil. Language is a major problem at all state departments. Measures are being taken to address the issue, he said. The President said the UN officials pointed out that the abilities of the judges must be assessed as well.
He requested the Sri Lanka Judges' Institute to formulate a method to assess the abilities of the judges. He added that before nominating names to the Constitutional Assembly to promote judges, he would always refer to the Attorney Generals Department to know whether any complaints or issues were there against a promotion.
The President said the Judges' Institute should present an accepted method to promote judges. "Complaining after a promotion causes difficulties," he said..

2017 a decisive year... what next for 2018 
Creating a shared future in a fractured world would be the goal of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2018. In the last 12 months the global context has changed dramatically after Donald Trump became President of the United States.
Many political issues have re-emerged on multiple fronts with wide-ranging political, economic and social consequences. Russia-USA tensions are no longer just a relic of the Cold War. Economic prosperity and social cohesion are not one and the same. The UN can no longer protect world unity or heal itself.
Politically, new and divisive narratives are transforming governance. Economically, policies are being formulated to preserve the benefits of global integration while limiting shared obligations such as sustainable development, inclusive growth and managing the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
Globally, citizens yearn for responsive leadership; yet, a collective purpose remains elusive despite ever-expanding social and political networks. All the while, the social contract between states, religious institutions and their citizens continues to erode. Therefore religious leaders are looking to re-dedicate leaders from all walks of life to develop a shared narrative to improve the state of the world.
Given Donald Trump's 'belligerent' approach to North Korea, the risks posed to the global economy should not be ignored. High asset prices, rapid credit growth in China, political turmoil in Catalonia and a cliff-edge Brexit are key risks to an improving global outlook.
The IMF has also said the global economys recent recovery may not last, despite a pickup in activity in all Western countries, except the UK. Therefore for many emerging markets, 2018 would be a very decisive year. For Sri Lanka, given the tough overseas economic outlook and the huge debt portfolio it is a either saga of gloom or bloom, but from a more realistic view for Sri Lanka, it could be a balance of the two. What happens inside Sri Lanka between now and June will really determine the future direction of Sri Lanka for the next five years.
2018 Outlook
Sri Lanka in 2018 needs to arrest the trend of lower foreign investment, slow growth in manufacturing, declining exports, a large trade deficit, balance of payments difficulties and low foreign exchange reserves. We will be compelled to borrow from foreign sources to repay our foreign debt obligations. According to banking sources, interest rates are expected to largely remain at current levels; a corresponding drop in demand for credit in the private sector is therefore expected.
In addition to the challenges for the financial sector, the slowdown in credit activity for construction is expected and with Sri Lanka poised to become a regional and an international services hub, there would be new opportunities for public-private partnerships.
A continued high-interest environment may also spark a rise in bad debt, with an increase in risk in commercial real estate financing and consumer housing loans. We would certainly see new life and general buoyancy in capital markets if the regulators can get the right balance.
Sri Lanka's annual growth pace is expected to pick up from the previous year, boosted by services, stronger manufacturing activity, agricultural growth and a pickup in domestic demand. However, like other South Asian countries, Sri Lanka too is vulnerable to political developments in the Middle East, given the reliance of South Asia on imported crude oil and employment.
Private Sector
As Sri Lankan enterprises improve their governance structures, risk and compliance policies and practices, they will be better positioned to seek alternative sources of funding overseas. Easier access to capital abroad will increase competitive pressure in the domestic banking sector.
Furthermore, in light of the move to create an enabling environment for business to create larger and stronger institutions that are well capitalized, with strong regional presence, the private sector would derive scale benefits with regard to operational cost and also be able to participate in large projects to a greater degree than now.
Challenge for Sri Lanka
The big political challenge for Sri Lanka in 2018 is when Sri Lanka returns to Geneva to answer for 'collateral damage' which unfortunately is the futile aspect of war.
The other big challenge Sri Lanka is faced is the significant revenue shortfalls. However, with all the cards in his hand, President and also the Prime Minister, together should not let lesser ideals stop Sri Lanka becoming the great new entrepot centre of the Asia Pacific in its own right with many Western nations now standing steadfastly on our side.
Moreover, given Chinese involvement in the Hambantota Port and industrial park and India taking over the Mattala airport, one of the biggest concerns for the world economy is that the Chinese Bubble has begun to pop.
The Chinese economy that grew by an extraordinary amount over the past few decades is slowing down; it is only a matter of time before China starts tightening its belt for Overseas Development Aid (ODA).
Therefore, if the Chinese economy looks inward, the troubles persist in Europe and if Trump decides to strike, it is very likely to drag the rest of the world down. In addition, turmoil in the Middle East could adversely affect many developing countries who depend on worker remittances.
So countries like Sri Lanka would need to look elsewhere for low cost capital to fund their mega infrastructure development projects and to export.
Therefore all stakeholders must get together at the start of the year, to ensure targeted structural reforms are in place to attract foreign direct investment and expand the economys capacity to absorb new technology. And certainly export manufacturing can re-shape the economy in 2018.
On the other hand, globally economists expect credit conditions to improve in 2018 as economic growth picks up and low interest rates keep funding costs under control. Risks to this favorable outlook include property market adjustment and continued political and geopolitical uncertainty.
In addition, a number of other challenges loom, including disruptions from new technology, population aging and climate change.

Australias Big Bash season set for greater heights
SYDNEY: Australias high-octane Big Bash League launches its seventh season on Tuesday with the whiz-bang Twenty20 cricket league looking to build on attendance and television ratings successes, with Perth Scorchers favourites to win another crown.
More than one million people went to BBL matches last season with average crowds topping 30,000.
While it trails the Indian Premier League (IPL) in overall attendance and financial clout, officials claim it was the fifth-biggest league in the world last season in terms of people turning up to watch.
Big Bash head Kim McConnie said Cricket Australia had even higher expectations for the fast-paced, family-friendly competition that sold out 35 matches last year.
There will be eight more fixtures, up to 43, and four new venues around the country. We believe this is going to be one of the most exciting BBL seasons to date, said McConnie, just two months into her job as the new BBL chief.
Sport is entertainment. So what were seeing, even from a cricket purist who loves to watch the Big Bash because they love the competition, they also like the entertainment and the fact they can bring their kids.
They want to be entertained and make sure theyre getting more for their dollar. In glitzy style, BBL has led the way with LED stumps and bails flashing on impact. They also have helmet cameras on batsmen and in recent seasons players have been worn microphones to talk to commentators during play.
Former England captain Kevin Pietersen got himself into trouble last season when he was charged and fined for criticising an umpires decision while wearing a microphone on-field.
Explosive hitters
Reigning champions Perth Scorchers are hot favourites for their fourth crown, while Melbourne Stars, featuring polarising batsman Pietersen, are chasing their elusive first title after several years of near misses.
The Scorchers have maintained the bulk of their squad from last years triumphant season and are likely to again contend for glory with coach Justin Langer again at the helm and English allrounder David Willey as their overseas import.
Brisbane Heat, who finished second in the regular competition last season, possesses two explosive hitters with local Chris Lynn, who leads the BBLs six tally with 94, and retired New Zealand star Brendon McCullum.
The Sydney Sixers, crushed by the Scorchers in last seasons final, again have big-hitting Englishman Jason Roy as their overseas player along with Test bowlers Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon.
Skipper Aaron Finch leads the under-performing Melbourne Renegades, who have boom-hitting West Indian Kieran Pollard on their books.
Pollard will miss the first seven games of the tournament due to international commitments and Afghanistan off-spinner Mohammad Nabi fills his place.
Sydney Thunder have former Australian all-rounder Shane Watson backing up for another season aged 36, while overseas import Jos Buttler has the three quickest ODI centuries for England, including a 46-ball effort against Pakistan.
The Thunder only have Buttlers services for the opening six matches when he leaves for international duty.
The other two franchises in the eight-team BBL are the Hobart Hurricanes and Adelaide Strikers.
The final takes place on February 4. AFP

Australia win Ashes with crushing victory in Third Test
Perth: Australia won back the Ashes after bowling England out cheaply despite rain delays and a pitch controversy to secure an innings win on the final day of the third Test in Perth on Monday.
Having confirmed his status as the worlds best batsman with a match-winning double century, Steve Smith added victorious Ashes captain to his ever-expanding resume as England were dismissed for 218 in their second innings in the last Ashes Test to take place at the WACA Ground. That gave the home side an innings-and-41-run win and an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the five-match series, having won the opening two Tests in Brisbane and Adelaide.
Pat Cummins secured the famous urn for the home side when he had Chris Woakes caught behind for 22, prompting Australian celebrations.But while it was a comfortable win, there was high drama on the final day courtesy of yet another WACA pitch controversy.
Victory seemed assured for Australia when they had England 132 for four at the conclusion of the fourth day, still 127 runs behind with Australia yet to bat again, but a rain-damaged pitch threatened to end the match without a ball being bowled on the final day.
Showers had caused play to be abandoned early on the fourth day and they continued through to Monday morning, forcing a scheduled early resumption to be cancelled, with Australia needing just six more wickets to win the match and regain the Ashes.
Complicating matters further was a damp spot on the pitch, just outside the popping crease at the southern end of the ground. WACA staff worked furiously with leaf blowers to try to dry the patch out as more showers passed through and the covers came on and off at regular intervals throughout the morning.
How the water got onto the wicket was unclear, although there was speculation it might have been linked to strong winds lifting the covers. But umpires Chris Gaffaney and Marais Erasmus would not allow play to resume until they believed the pitch had been returned to the same condition as at the end of day four.Play did not get under way until after lunch, and even then to the chagrin of an English camp who felt the conditions were dangerous.
Englands batsmen also had to contend with balls jagging violently off cracks on the pitch in a contentious end to 47 years of Ashes cricket at the WACA Ground.
Wickets tumbled quickly for England upon the delayed resumption, with overnight batsman and first-innings centurion Jonny Bairstow bowled for 14 by the first delivery he faced for the day from Josh Hazlewood, which kept low.
Hazlewood removed Englands last hope Dawid Malan -- who backed up his first innings century with a fighting 54 before being caught behind -- to finish with figures of 5-48.Malans first day heroics, when England appeared to be in a dominant position at 368-4 from which an innings defeat would be almost impossible, seemed a distant memory as he trudged from the field.

It was a scene of joy and revelry! The Christmas tree glistened with glitter, its branches laden with blue and red balls. Snow shown white on its branches and mistletoe and green wreaths hung everywhere. Santa stood near the tree, a look of contentment and satisfaction on his red face as he took another swig from his bottle and stared at Mrs Santa, Its been a good season! he said taking another swig, then waving at the reindeer who peeped in through his window.
The doorbell rang!
Who can it be asked Santa to himself, as he stopped the Jingle Bells tune which had been playing in his home and all the homes throughout the world, Who could be ringing my bell today He took another swig ashis doorbell rang again.
Who are you asked Santa opening the door then staring with surprise at the official notice that was thrust in his face, You a lawyer
Yes! said the figure at the door, And this is a notice from a birthday boy!
Santa asked Mrs Santa for his glasses and sat down to read the official document sent to him on Christmas Day, Ive been accused of impersonation and theft! cried Santa, Whoever could accuse me of such
The birthday boywhos birthday you stole! said the lawyer.
How could I have stolen his birthday asked Santa, and then watched with surprise as Mrs Santa nodded her head, I told you, youve been doing so husband, and you never listened to me! You go around in that sleigh of yours, creep down chimneys, kiss young mothers under Christmas trees, and Ive been warning you youre stealing someone elses birthday!
Santa looked crestfallen and stared at the lawyer, Its them people of the world, they started thinking Christmas was all about me!
The tall lawyer held the door open.
You want me to leave asked Santa and Mrs Santa nodded, You want me to leave right now
Along with your reindeer, and sleigh and those gifts you carry! said the lawyer as he continued holding the door open and let Santa, his missus and the reindeer out.
Mrs Santa stood outside a moment, before she got onto her husbands sleigh, she watched as a young couple with a baby walked into her home. They sat down next to a crib, in a manger full of hay. She saw cattle with gentle eyes looking into the crib, and she got off her sleigh and walked to the manger. The mother looked up and smiled at her and then she along with the shepherds and angels they allsang to the baby Jesus whos celebration it actually was
Joy to the world, the Lord is come, let earth receive her king

Cant see a bilateral series between India and Pakistan in future  Shahryar Khan
Do you feel that the proposed FTP for the period 2019-2023 is beneficial to Pakistans interests
Shahryar Khan: I have absolutely no issue with the number of games which have been proposed in the FTP arrangement. This is basically a question of quality over quantity and we have chosen the right route for this. There have been some reports in newspapers that we have been awarded less games and this is supposedly a bad thing, but this is simply not the case. What they do not understand is that we may be playing less games, but we will be playing quality games with the best 4-5 teams in the world. Those with more matches as per FTP are playing a lot of their games against the much weaker teams whilst we have opted to play less games but with stronger teams. And of course, the quality of the opposition and the competitiveness of the games will also drive the revenues that we earn from such games. Our broadcasting revenues from games against opposition such as Australia, South Africa etc will be much better as compared to games against weaker opponents.
Do you envisage an India and Pakistan meeting in a bilateral series any time in the near future
SK: The real reason behind the absence of India and Pakistan bilateral series is political and has nothing to do with either PCB or BCCI. In the current political climate, I really do not see any way in the near future that both teams will be able to play each other. The fact of the matter is that we have always been willing to play India anywhere but it's been the Government of India who have forced the BCCI to refuse to play us and there is not much we can do about that. I don't see a bilateral series between India and Pakistan anytime in the near future.
Regardless of the political issues, do you feel that the BCCI are sincere in their efforts to play against Pakistan
SK: I know for a fact that they tried to convince their Government and explained to them that there would be a loss of revenue for both India and Pakistan. However, the Government of India has stuck by its stand that unless the political climate improves, there can be no resumption of cricketing relations between both countries.
They will simply not allow it. But, I am hopeful for the future and hope things can change but at this time, there is no chance of any India-Pakistan cricket contact in a bilateral context. We will continue to play India in ICC tournaments as we did in the Champions Trophy and so on, but no Test or Limited Overs series will be played between the two countries in the foreseeable future.
Do you agree with Ehsan Mani when he said that PCBs compensation claim against the BCCI will have a negative effect on future relations between the two boards
SK: He is of course entitled to his own opinions, but I do not agree with that. The relations between the two boards have never been a problem. I will say it again, its the Government of India and their insistence on the improvement of the political climate which is the main hurdle between the two sides. It has nothing to do with our compensation claim which is really our right to exercise and we are doing that via the proper channels.
Is the success of the PSL overshadowing the development of domestic cricket in Pakistan
SK: There is no doubt that the Pakistan Super League is a fantastic product and is helping our cricketers progress to the next level. It is also demonstrating to the world that cricketers from around the world can come and play in a Pakistan tournament without fear of security which will also encourage their boards to send teams as Sri Lanka have done recently. West Indies will also be sending their team to Pakistan in March as agreed so the advent of the PSL has had a positive effect.
I look at the PSL as complementing and enhancing the image of our domestic cricket and something which is opening the doors for tours by foreign teams. That in turn will allow our domestic cricket to improve as well.
You made some critical comments on the T10 format, do you still stand by them
SK: I have absolutely no qualms in saying that the T10 format is not the way forward and reducing overs in a cricket game is demeaning to the stature of this great game. The Twenty20 format has done well and is acceptable to all and undermining that by introducing a T10 format is tantamount to killing the goose that lays the golden egg.
Does it bother you that Pakistan players are giving preference to leagues such as the BPL and the T10 league over domestic games
SK: Pakistan players playing in any foreign league when they should be participating in local competitions is completely unacceptable in my view. I believe that all Pakistan players should be given permission to participate in other leagues around the world without compromising on their ability to represent domestic teams in Pakistan which should be their first priority. Only once they have served their teams interests in local competitions should they look to play elsewhere. This is crucial for the development and strength of our domestic game.
How do you feel about the news that Afghanistan will be playing their inaugural Test match against India
SK: To be honest, I am not aggrieved but a little sad after hearing this news as it should have been Pakistan who played the first Test match with Afghanistan which would have been a historic occasion for both countries. In reality, this should have been the case and we had arranged for that, but their board took a very political and an unnecessarily aggressive line towards Pakistan which is completely uncalled for. Whilst we obviously wish the Afghanistan cricket team the best of luck as they embark on a new chapter of their cricket history, it is a rather sad to hear that Afghanistan will not be playing their first ever Test match against Pakistan.

CEB employees to receive bonus
The Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy has decided to provide the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) with their bonuses for this year. The Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy was expected to receive approval for the bonuses through a special paper submitted to the CEB Director Board yesterday.
Joint Trade Union Alliance Convener, Ranjan Jayalal speaking to Daily News said, The Engineers who took the bribe of Rs 225,000 in 2014 have requested the Ministry not to provide our bonuses. We would launch a continuous strike if the bonuses are not given to us. A total of 23,000 workers will join us in Colombo for the strike. President of the Engineers Union of the CEB, Saumya Kumarawadu in the meantime, explained that, In 2014 a salary scale was introduced for the technical staff by the government at the time and that it was through this that they had received their salary increments. Usually we get our increments every three years and the approvals which were taken in the year 2015 were for our increments for the year 2014.
The Viduli Sevaka Sangamaya of the Ceylon Electricity Board has filed a case in the Court of Appeal and the Accounts Division of the Ceylon Electricity Board has filed three cases in the Supreme Court, in which one of the cases was found to have no grounds to proceed further. So if we had taken any illegal money or bribe, the Courts would decide accordingly, he added.

Rangana Herath makes request for two Tests at a time
Chief selector confident batting will come good after new coach takes over
Chairman of selectors Graeme Labrooy believes that the national cricket teams bane which is their batting will come good once Chandika Hathurusingha takes over as the head coach from today.
From the Indian tour in Sri Lanka and then the Pakistan tour we see light at the end of the tunnel, there is an improvement but still to be decide, Labrooy told the Daily News. But now with Hathu coming on board we will have a batting coach who will be the head coach. That would put things right and I strongly believe that batting would come good.
Its getting in and building into and getting into winning ways again, going and finishing or trying to close games thats the challenge we have. We had India on the ropes in Sri Lanka they were something like seven down before those two guys (Dhoni and Kumar) got into partnership. We get into winning positions but we cant capitalize on it. Its down to experience at the end of the day. You have (Angelo) Mathews with the experience thereafter we lack in experience, Labrooy said.
Talking of the positives that came out of the recently concluded ODI series that Sri Lanka lost to India 2-1, Labrooy said, If you take a comparison with the Pakistan and Indian ODIs our guys played more competitive and positive cricket. Although we didnt come on top in both series we performed better. Our ODI performance was not as expected. In the first ODI we were outstanding in bowling and then going back and scoring the runs on that wicket we showed a lot of courage, unfortunately we couldnt carry it through. The second ODI we should have made a better call on the toss. We won and put them in on a flat track and we had to fight back from thereon.
The side looks that they believe in themselves they think that they can win and beat the best side in the world. They got that belief and play more positive cricket. In the Pakistan series they were too much on the back foot all the time. Even yesterday (Sunday) when the guys went out they looked positive.
Labrooys and Hathurusinghas international careers never ran parallel with each other although they played enough first-class club cricket. Hathurusingha was just starting to play Test cricket when Labrooys career was coming to an end in the third Test against New Zealand at Auckland I 1991. However the two are bound to make an impact on Sri Lankas cricket destiny in the coming years.
We had a chat last week officially Hathu takes over on December 19 (today). He wants to go forward and he is comfortable from what he has. He has an idea of what he wants to do, he wants to structure the support staff, wants to see the expectations from the players. With the conversation that I had with him I have confidence that the team can move forward and make great strides, said Labrooy.
The next meeting of the selection panel is to pick the one-day squad for the tri-series in Bangladesh starting next month and Labrooy said that they were looking at inviting Hathurusingha into their mix.
At the moment no, but we are looking at it. We always give the coach and the captain a good hearing and if our team is different from theirs then we ask them to justify it. If it fits into our strategy and if we are happy with it we give it to them. Most of the time we try to give them the squad they want. If we want to bring in somebody we tell them why and how he can fit into the strategy and the role he has to play, explained Labrooy.
RANGANA HERATHS FUTURE
Labrooy said that Sri Lankas prime bowler Rangana Herath has made a request that he cannot play a three Test series in future and the selection committee has honoured it.
Rangana is fit but when he plays in a match he bowls 30 overs flat and that takes a toll on his body. Because of his age (39) the recovery time is longer that is the only challenge otherwise he is okay, said Labrooy.
Being our main bowler he bowls 30-40 overs then he has two days recovery and he plays in the next Test. He has told us that he cannot play three Tests and we will honour that request. He can play three if he has not bowled much in the first two. In the second India Test he bowled 30 odd overs so the recovery period of the body is a little longer than the others.
LASITH MALINGAS FUTURE
The absence of Lasith Malingas name in the Sri Lanka ODI squad that played India in a series of three matches caused quite a stir in the local media. Quite contrary to certain reports stating that Malinga will not be selected to play for his country in the future, Labrooy painted a totally different picture to it.
We just basically rested him to have a look at the other bowlers. We have the Bangladesh T20 and the Nidahas tri-series. What happened is all these days he has not played in the longer version of the game (50 over). We told him to play much responsible cricket which he has started doing. Along with Hathu we want to plan out and see what Malingas future is. He is definitely in the plan for now, said Labrooy.
The main issue is that he has brought down his skin folds down to 71 which is very good, he looks fitter. Earlier it was in the mid 80s but still below he has worked hard in the last month and a half. The maximum pass mark is 90, we have players ranging from 45 -90 it depends on their composition of their body, height, weight, structure and all that. The lower the figure you are carrying lesser fat in your body. Malinga Pushpakumara failed it as he was 92 and above. He was to replace Rangana in India so we had to send (Jeffrey) Vandersay, he said.

The coconut fiasco
The TV viewers would have seen a mockery of Bandula Gunawardena. MP holding three coconuts and castigating the government for the high price of coconuts. This brought to my mind another reason for the short fall in the production, apart from fragmentation of vast acres of coconut land and the drought which we experienced.
This same Bandula Gunawardena, MP for the slightest provocation, goes to Kovils and dash coconuts invoking the deities seeking vengeance on the government for certain actions taken which he considers not favourable. Readers will remember, he once requested all Lankans to dash coconuts, which would mean 21 million (population in Sri Lanka) coconuts being dashed, an utter wastage and mockery.
Perhaps the deities, may be angry for disturbing their peace in bringing frivolous and meaningless prayers and had decided to teach a lesson, brought about this shortfall in production.
So, this foolery, or the entertainment by Members of Parliament will go on at the end we who are considered morons, have to grin and bear, making the poor mans pol sambol and rice, a luxury.
This goes for grinding chillies at Seenigama Devale, as a kilo of green chillies has risen to Rs.1000.

Colombo streets lit up from today
Tourism Development and Christian Affairs Ministry and the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) have launched an initiative to light up Colombo's streets for the festive season.
Under this initiative, Janadhipathi Mawatha, Galle Road (up to Bambalapitiya), Baudhaloka Mawatha, Duplication Road (up to Bambalapitiya), Reed Avenue, Thummulla junction, Union Place, Pittala Junction, Ibbanwela Junction, Liberty, Galle Face and Lake House roundabouts will be lit up, from December 19 to the first week of January .
SLTDA Community Relations Director Mihira Liyanaarachchi said 40 private sector organisations and several key state organisations have extended their support to the initiative.
The Sri Lanka Air Force will light up Chittampalam Gardiner Mawatha while the Navy will light up the streets around the Gangaramaya temple.The Army will light up Reid Avanue, Colombo 7.
"This project will take place for the third consecutive year," Liyanarachchi said, adding that it will turn out to be a major tourist attraction, this year.
"This is also in line with the two main Christmas festivals in Colombo - one organised by the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau and the other by the Sri Lanka Retailers Association. We believe this initiative will add value to all Christmas celebrations in Colombo," he explained.

## Title: Combating CoL
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial

Combating CoL
The high Cost of Living (CoL) is very much in the news these days. The CoL is a fact of life that sometimes does not adhere to Newtons Law that what goes up must come down. There has been a steady increase in the prices of certain food items, even though the prices of some foods fluctuate depending on their growing seasons.
Sri Lanka being a primarily agricultural nation, weather plays an important role in crop production and hence, the prices of food items. There is a prolonged drought in several parts of the country that has severely affected paddy cultivation, while incessant rain and flash floods in other areas have also hampered crop production. Coconut too has taken a similar hit with experts predicting that it would take until 2019 or 2020 for local coconut production to reach normal levels. It is basic economics really  when the supply is short but the demand is greater, a price rise is generally inevitable. Rice prices have been affected in particular, with some varieties carrying a retail price of over Rs.100 per kilo.
To its credit, the Government has taken many measures to control the runaway CoL. One of the main planks in this programme is the removal of duties and taxes on many imported food items well before the presentation of Budget 2018 last month despite revenue implications. The Government has re-imposed or adjusted these rates whenever the local production could meet the demand and has also stipulated maximum retail prices for a range of items. It has also made use of the extensive CWE or Sathosa retail network of 3,000 shops to sell essential items at concessionary prices which are much lower than those offered by private supermarket chains. The Government has also placed an urgent international order for 200,000 MT of rice to ward off the present shortage and high prices.
In a latest move, eight essential food items including rice, dhal, sprats, potatoes and onions will be provided to the people under a relief package to relieve the CoL burden on a decision taken by the Cabinet Sub Committee on the Cost of Living chaired by President Maithripala Sirisena. The relief package or Sahana Malla will be provided right until the forthcoming Sinhala and Tamil New Year season, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said.
The Sathosa shops and private traders will be entrusted with the task of issuing the relief package, in addition to the major supermarket chains and marketing firms in various cities. Since these outlets serve only one third of the countrys population, the Government plans to include dedicated economic centres and private shops too in the programme. This is a step in the right direction as consumers will be able to get a good deal on several items which would cost far more if purchased separately. Depending on its success the Government should consider making it a fixed feature not limited to festive seasons.
The authorities should address several other factors that determine retail prices of food items and many other goods. Every attempt should be made to cut out the middleman who buys produce from farmers for a pittance and then sells it to wholesale/retail traders for a far higher price. Add the retailers margin to the mix and the consumer literally has to pay a hefty price.
Post-Harvest Losses (PHL) is another worrying factor. It has been estimated that more than 40 percent of most local crops are wasted during transport and warehousing/storage. Reducing PHL must be a priority for the agricultural agencies of the Government. We often see a glut of most crops during the season. Since we lack proper storage mechanisms including cold rooms in most areas to keep harvests for use out of season, some of the seasonal harvest is wasted. This leads to a vicious cycle where the crops get very expensive out of season. Agriculture experts should study how other countries deal with this problem. Moreover, homeowners with even a small land plot should be encouraged to grow vegetables and fruits which will reduce their CoL bill.
There is much talk about import substitution, but the truth is that we spend millions of dollars to import fruits and vegetables, some of which are grown in Sri Lanka. One can argue the case for importing fruits such as apple which cannot be grown here with any degree of success, but there is no rationale for importing fruits such as guava and papaya. For a country that has 1,340 Km of coastline, Sri Lanka imports a staggering amount of canned fish  last year alone, Rs.7.8 billion had been spent on fish imports. If our fisheries sector, including inland fisheries can be developed further, we may be able to stop fish imports in the coming years. The dependence on expensive imported powdered milk (at an annual cost of Rs.40 billion) too can be reduced by developing the local dairy industry. There are many paths to reducing CoL and the Government must be commended for exploring all these options with vigour.

Off course
Driving in a car is much more dangerous than flying in a plane, we have heard. Yet a single plane crash will suffice to hit headlines. Which is why the airline crews are paid well. But does that give us a guarantee of a safe flight
Duncan Jayawardane, with decades of expertise in civil aviation, entertains doubts about it.
A student of mine, who scored 96% for the subject Aero Engines, was asked by her flight instructor to show him where the oil tank of a Cessna 152 is. Her short and simple reply was does the aircraft have an oil tank By this answer we can arrive at a conclusion, which is, of course, disturbing  it shows that we make sure the students achieve the short term objective (the pass mark of 75%) but completely ignore the long term objectives of training, which is to understand and fly the aeroplane from A to B safely. Not just a Cessna 152 or similar type of light aircraft, which would only be a stepping-stone in a pilots career, but the real long term objective, which is of course flying an Airbus A320, or an aeroplane of similar type someday.
Duncan Jayawardane
Titled as Broken Compass, the book contains many such anecdotes ultimately summing up the tragedy of flying schools. Any aeroplane with a broken compass will not head in the right direction, Jayawardena notes.
The book is not about laws of aviation. But it will be a good manual for anyone interested in aviation to work under the banner of a flying training school.
Most flight instructors choose that career because they have no option. Then may claim to have flown quite a few planes. But a proper flight instructor should have expertise in flying numerous types of flights.
The tragic offshoot is that the aero students lose their track. That said, the Broken Compass offers motivational tips to make all those who work under the banner of a flying training school become better - better human beings, better company employees, better instructors and better students. It ultimately leads to a better company headed in the right direction.
Handing over a copy of the book to Civil Aviation Authority Chief Executive Officer H M C Nimalsiri.
My personal experience in aviation training and the experience of many other stalwarts in the field of aviation is dove-tailed to give the reader a better, if not a perfect, understanding of ones own commitments toward the field we love and cherish. I have cried, laughed, talked, listened, learned, taught, condemned, admired and even been confused many a time during my career of 45 years in aviation. But I have enjoyed and loved every moment of my life as an aviator. I still do!
Adds he: All of us owe something to aviation for treating us well and giving us the opportunity to meet and associate so many wonderful people within the aviation family. There is no doubt each and every one of us have to repay a debt to aviation, although I am not too sure whether I would be able to do it in full in this lifetime.
Jayawardane considers the book as a genuine effort to repay his debt. He has spoken to his colleagues and quite a few stalwarts in aviation, inclusive of airline captains, to obtain advice when compiling this book.
The ideas and opinions published here are not only mine but a few other greats as well. In the pages to follow, I may have missed out on certain important areas I should have mentioned in the book. That is unintentional in one aspect. The other is that I do not believe that anyone could do a one hundred percent accurate or complete job of writing on any topic in aviation for that matter.
Although Jayawardane wants to mention certain names, he has intentionally abstained from doing so, as there are too many important names to be mentioned. The book includes some tips to the flying school administrators, instructors and students on how to better their performances from how they perform now in their respective disciplines.
I do not in any way attempt to tarnish the good name of individuals or organisations. On the contrary, this is an honest effort to pave the way for everyone to walk hand in hand and to tow the line together in harmony, to uplift an industry we love, Jayawardane notes.
An excerpt
Aviation is a fast-moving industry with an extremely rapid rate of development.
I really do not know whether the Wright brothers ever imagined that within the life- span of a human being, just 66 years after their historic flight which took place on 17th December 1903 and which lasted only 12 seconds in the air, a Boeing 747 carrying over 500 passengers would fly non-stop for 12 hours.
The rate of growth is unimaginable. We shall never know what the world may see in the skies in another 50 years.
In my opinion, training in aviation is greatly affected by the three main factors of hindrance: complexity, time and money  all of which the flying schools are compelled to tackle methodically and wisely.
Complexity: the modern aeroplane is full of complicated and complex systems which require a constant updating of knowledge, especially on the part of the instructors who they have to impart this knowledge.
Time: time is money, they say. This, to a great extent, is true of aviation, more so than any other industry I would guess.
An instructor unfortunately is not given all the time in the world to impart the knowledge or skills to students, and the time available for teaching or learning is therefore very limited, especially considering training expenses.
To students, this is a great challenge, which is to learn many new things in a comparatively short time. Although they say failures are the pillars of success, failures are not tolerated in aviation. The problem can be mitigated by choosing skilful and knowledgeable instructors.
A school therefore, cannot be satisfied with just good instructors but, only excellent ones. The traits of an excellent instructor are many.

From cricket to music
The world lost a great cricketer but the music industry gained a great musician! Melodies features Melantha Perera a man whose perseverance and flair for originality has enabled him to become an idol and example to other next generation musicians.
Perera runs a music school called Riversheen and plays in two bands named Sign and Brexit. He hails from a musical family. His first instrument was the Ukulele and had a piano to play on. He owes who he is today to his mother, Trila and brother Rukshan who helped him when he began entering the music industry.
When the Rawathawatte Methodist church had a charity event, I was in charge of getting the artists together and providing the music. I selected the musicians who are the present members of the band Sign since it clicked off very well, we continued performing together, said Perera.
Perera had two interests  Cricket and Music. Yet the former had to be given up which paved the way for Perera to excel in music. It would have been interesting to have seen what he would have achieved with the bat or ball in his hand but fate had other ideas. Singing on stage Perera became a music icon.
I was a cricketer, but due to injuries that occurred while on the field, i had to give it up. Since I loved music, I started learning musical instruments and this gave me the opportunity enter the music scene, which paved the way for my musical future, explained Perera.
A man with a big heart as big as his voice he believes his music can heal and touch people in away only music can! He believes in making a difference in the world by touching souls. No doubt his music has a certain quality that is able to connect with his audience at a different level.
Its the way to touch souls and make this world a better place. I inherited all my musical knowledge from my mother, who thought out of the box. So I follow her way of doing it. When it comes to writing original songs. I keep at it until I am satisfied, said Perera.
Working with the other band members is an exciting process. They have an understanding and a friendship that helps them create great music.
Its an experience where we share our talent and knowhow, making it easy to understand each other better. No doubt its a blessed band that helped me earn my name in the music industry, giving me the opportunity to implement most of my ideas and where many of the next generation musicians took up to music after listening to us, pointed out Perera.
Perera has known great success. But it is not a one man show. It is a team effort. It is mixture of hard work and discipline.
Success is a journey, not a destination and from the inception of my journey the source of encouragement has been from my loving wife Devika Perera and then my two talented children Devshan and Michelle Perera. In terms of my bands, it is pure discipline that has taken us a long way and this is advice for the young generation. Yes everyone has their original songs and most of them are very popular and a few yet to be heard, added Perera.
The great Freddie Mercury is a musician that Perera looks up to. Indeed Perera is rueful that Mercury is no longer with us. It is a pity why so many great leaders do not get to see the impact they make on history and that is the same for musicians.
My idol is Freddie Mercury, and its so sad that hes not amongst the living to hear more of his extraordinary creations. We dont stick to one genre, Sign has a wide repertoire where we can tackle any event without a problem. For the second year consecutive, we perform at Heritance Hotel Negombo for the New Years Eve dance, stated Perera.
We have our originals lined up and when the time comes, it will be published. And I would like to say - Love what you do and do it right, be open for constructive criticism , suggestions, ideas, and learn to select the right one, and in no time you will be on top, said Perera.

Deniyaya to receive 500 bed hospital
Construction of a brand new 500 bed hospital in Deniyaya will begin next year, according to Law, Order and Southern Development Minister, Sagala Ratnayake.
The Minister last week, undertook an inspection tour of the proposed land for the building.
The Deniyaya hospital is a very old one. Its capacity is not only low but the old buildings were crumbling and have been constructed on just one level. It is a very difficult task to take a patient from one ward to another. Especially in 2003, the hospital premises were subjected to landslides, said the minister.
He explained that they had been on the lookout for a land to construct a new hospital for a long time. Eventually, they focused on three suitable areas.
"Now we have found the ideal location. Geological surveys and the NBRO Department have certified this land 100 percent for construction," he added.
The 2018 Budget too has included this hospital in their proposals.
We will prepare the ground in early 2018. Thereafter construction will begin. As a result many people will receive benefits through this project. In the second phase, we will build a good training facility, said Minister Ratnayake.
"Our Southern Development projects are taking effect now. Especially, the Hambantota Port project will now begin. At the same time we will start its industrial zone. The Weligama Charlie Mount Industrial complex too will commence and we are now in the process of acquiring land for that. These projects will create jobs and bring in foreign exchange into the country," explained the minister.
We have also started many tourism related projects which will give us quick returns. The main aim of the ministry is to create jobs and through that bring about economic development, he added.

Dusit Thanis beachfront property lights Balapitiya
Asias largest beach resort, The Beachfront, Balapitiya, constructed at a cost of US$ 200 million will be opened at Balapitiya in 2019.
Located in Balapitiya on the Southern coastal belt and 50 kms from Colombo, The Beachfront is considered as Sri Lankas one and only apartment and resort which will have over 500 apartments after completion of the second phase.
Speaking at a media briefing, Dusit Thani Apartment Resort Director Ajit Wijesinghe highlighted the current progress of the construction work of the resort and said that the has 162 apartments and 50% has already been sold to 92 local and foreign nationals and the ownership of 50% of the apartments are foreigners.
He said while the construction of the first stage is underway, announcements will be made with regard to the second phase of the project which includes a beautifully designed and landscaped beachside promenade providing a host of outstanding dining and entertaining choices consisting of Western, European and Asian inspired casual and fine dining restaurants, barista cafes, patisseries, champagne lounges, beer and whiskey bars.
He said in stage two, the resort will also contain Asias largest beach club which will have state-of-the-art architecture whilst highlighting the natural beauty of the beach which will become the go-to spot in the south of Sri Lanka.
The operations of the beach club will be run by a world renowned international beach club operator, he said.
He said this resort is the countrys one and only luxury investment high-rise resort-style development and the five-star property is designed by a renowned Singaporean architectural firm. He also said the Beachfront, Balapitiya, is located on a lush, tropical site featuring 1.2 kilometres of direct access to four pristine beaches on Sri Lankas famous West Coast between Bentota and Hikkaduwa.
When questioned about the 15% tax on apartments, Wijesinghe said that there is no question about the tax taken by the government as government needs revenue and therefore Dusit Thani is ready to pay whatever tax charged by the government.
He said in addition to Sri Lanka, Dusti Thani has also constructed apartment resorts in Dubai, China and Thailand.
He also said apartment resorts are world famous and currently countries such as Dubai, Australia, Hawaii, UAE and Thailand.

Future of Sri Lankas economy
The labour model in the country must be restructured in order for the country to move forward economically, said Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy at the Sri Lanka Economic Association (SLEA) last week. Further, he chastised both the government and the domestic private sectors for facilitating what he called deficits in both execution and trust, respectively.
He was speaking to members of the private and public sectors, gathered for a seminar organized by SLEA on the future direction of economic policy in the country. Graced by Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva, Coomaraswamy, Entrepreneur Samantha Kumarasinghe, and members of the leadership from SLEA, the seminar featured speeches by each of them. Representing the viewpoints of the government, the central bank, and the business community, each spoke for around twenty minutes and offered their complementary yet also competing ideas for the countrys economic future.
The Government Perspective
First up to speak was Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva, providing the governments perspective on the countrys economic future. He began by pointing out that economic policy cannot be discussed in isolation, that economic policy is intrinsically impacted by and related to issues like the countrys foreign policy, trade relations, and domestic security.
On this note, he iterated the improvements made by the current government to the overall political situation, not just economic or financial, it inherited from the previous administration.
When we came into office in 2015, things were not very rosy. On the international front, we had multiple challenges. We were about to be hauled into the International Criminal Court on war crimes, and our military was to be dragged into some sort of tribunal in the Hague. Also at the same time, it was imminent that various economic sanctions were to be imposed on us, de Silva said.
So on the foreign policy side, we made a complete U-turn, in terms of policies as well as international engagement.
By bringing the international community on the side of the country, he said, Sri Lanka was able to regain its GSP plus status with the European Union, opening up duty-free access to the market for over 6,600 products.
Of the non-explicitly economic factors that contribute to a countrys positive economy, de Silva explained that this one is the first: creating peace in a sustainable way, which allows the country and its relations both domestically and internationally to progress.
The second factor he delineated was the need to provide the people of Sri Lanka with a sense of ownership over their own government. This, he said, along with creating peace, must be done as prerequisites for the economy to improve.
He stressed the efforts the government has taken, often underappreciated, he says, by the general public, to restore the trust, including the passage and implementation of Right to Information legislation, and the assurance of a free press.
After briefly touching on issues of problematic regulation, land ownership disputes and the need for Sri Lanka to continue moving in the direction of a tradable economy, de Silva concluded his speech by providing his view of what Sri Lankas economic future has in store.
To me, we are not a South Asian country. We are an Indian Ocean country, De Silva said. And the governments vision is clear: to make sure we are the centre of the Indian Ocean, where growth will take place over the next three to five decades.
Central Bank Perspective
Speaking next was Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, who provided more substance to de Silvas testimony on government-rooted economic improvements in the past two years and specifically highlighted some recent positive economic news.
The IMF (International Monetary Fund) successfully completed a review of our extended funding arrangement in the last week. The Hambantota deal was completed on Saturday.
There is now, in my view, better alignment between the governments policy statement and the budget, which I think will make for more predictable and more consistent policies. There is foreign money flowing into the government securities market and this is accelerated in the last week or two. Foreign money has flown into the stock exchange, Coomaraswamy said.
All these seem to indicate that there is a certain improvement in the level of confidence in the Sri Lankan economy.
Still, he said, there is no room for complacency if Sri Lanka is to achieve the economic development it hopes to.
To strengthen the macroeconomic fundamentals of the economy, he noted the governments efforts regarding fiscal consolidation, intended to bring the budget deficit down to 3.5 percent of the GDP. He added that this year, for the first time in over half a century, there is a very good chance that the primary balance of the budget will be in surplus.
If you take interest payments out, revenue will exceed expenditure. That is the first time this has happened, or will happen, since the early 1950s, he said.
I hope we can conclude from this that some of the structural deficiencies in the government budget are beginning to be addressed. Certainly the new Inland Revenue Act, the reforms to the VAT, are major continuity factors in terms of addressing the structural deficits that have been in the budget for many years now.
Looking to the future, Coomaraswamy provided many policy suggestions for ways in which to improve the countrys economic landscape. He said the country needs to strengthen its Fiscal Responsibility Management Act, so that deviation from economic goals is limited only to extreme circumstances such as natural disasters or severe depressions and to remove para tariffs so that the country is no longer excluded from the global supply chain. Currently, only seven percent of Sri Lankas exports go through the global supply chain, versus 22 percent of exports from India, which is considered a closed economy. He also insisted that the countrys currency exchange rates be managed in a flexible and market oriented manner.
Regarding Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Coomaraswamy insisted that the growth model must be private-sector driven.
The state does not have the fiscal space to drive development, he said. This is not ideological. Its a practical conclusion we have to reach.
He also emphasized the need for a fundamental review of land mix and crop use.
Can we not produce all our paddies in the dry zone and use the wet zone for higher quality produce
Central Bank Perspective on Labour
Coomaraswamy then spent the bulk of his remaining speech arguing for the country to re-evaluate the way its labour is regulated, utilized, and distributed.
According to Coomaraswamy, there is no labour shortage in the country as some claim, but instead, people are working in the wrong sectors, with too many working in agriculture. He cited a Harvard University study which states that an economy at Sri Lankas level of development should have no more than 15 percent of a its labour-force be agricultural. In Sri Lanka, the figure is 27 percent, while agriculture makes up just seven percent of the GDP. A third of the workforce lives below the poverty line.
We are trapping people in low-productivity, low-income livelihoods in agriculture. By giving people free water, fertilizer subsidies, and a guaranteed price, people stay in agriculture and cant go any further, Coomaraswamy said.
He claimed that the incentive structures keeping people in these agricultural jobs must be re-evaluated, and that investment is required in higher-productivity, higher-income jobs in order to shift the labour force.
Similarly, Coomaraswamy also said there was a surplus of labour in the public sector, which accounts for about 17-18 percent of the total workforce.
But again, he said, people are behaving very rationally. Because it is only the eighteen percent of the people in the public service who have a pension, a non contributive pension. So its absolutely rational behaviour for people to want a job in the public sector.
He said that there are too many people in the public sector and that redistributing the labour force more intelligently would require that everyone have a pension. If this is to happen, he said, all pensions must become contributive.
Speaking of labour standards, Coomaraswamy said that labour laws and regulations actually produce unintended negative outcomes, leading to poorer working conditions overall.
While the limited number of people in the former sector enjoy strong protection, what these labour laws do is reduce the overall labour standard in the economy, he said.
How does that happen The firms in the formal sector get around the labour laws by casualizing employment. So we find all the big firms employ a significant amount of people on a casual basis where the labour laws dont apply. That reduces the overall standard of labour.
He maintained that a tripartite effort must bring together the government, private sector and labour unions to create a set of labour laws which protect workers but also create incentives for capital.
Concluding his speech, Coomaraswamy imparted upon the audience three main takeaways. The first is that Sri Lanka has the potential to be the only country in the world with preferential access to markets in India, China, and Europe through the GSP plus, a key differentiator between Sri Lanka and other countries trying to attract FDI. The second is that, in his view, the debate over the Hambantota Port deal has been framed poorly. He insisted that the deal is good for the people of the area, who will see their backyards and livelihoods transformed for the better by investment triggered by the deal. The same, he said, was true for a potential international port deal in Trincomalee.
And the final takeaway Coomaraswamy mentioned was twofold. According to him, the country is currently suffering from two main deficits. The government has an execution deficit, failing in the past to deliver on promises made and as a result the private sector has a deficit of trust in the government.
There have been issues related to the consistency and predictability of policies. But in my view, that is being addressed. So now, its up to the private sector to recalibrate its risk appetite and to open their wallets and start to invest, he said.
In the next year to eighteen months, its the domestic private sector that has to take the lead. And I think, hopefully, the conditions are being created for them to do that.
Private Sector Perspective
Coomaraswamys reference to the domestic private sector was a fitting prelude to the evenings third and final speaker, Entrepreneur Samantha Kumarasinghe, the founder of Natures Beauty Creations Cosmetics. Despite the previous testimonies of both de Silva and Coomaraswamy, Kumarasinghe harshly criticized the current governments economic policies. Specifically, he chastised the current government for how it relates to and facilitates private sector entrepreneurship.
I have questioned whether consecutive governments have listened to the private sector when making economic decisions, he said. Comparing the previous regime with the current one, Kumarasinghe insisted that the current government has vastly underperformed in its duty to easing the burden on the private sector.
At present they pretend to listen, but go and do the total opposite.
He criticized the government for what he alleges are failures of various trade agreements including ISFTA (Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement), PSFTA (Pakistan Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement), CEPA (Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement), and ETCA (Economic & Technology Cooperation Agreement), to bring positive results to Sri Lanka, claiming that it neglected to properly consult private sector stakeholders.
He then mentioned Sri Lankas impending free trade agreement with China, which he chastised, saying that it will only benefit four or five apparel export companies while harming all other industrialists amounting to over 50,000 entrepreneurs and over one million employees.
Moving along, he outlined what he views as wrong economic decisions which he claims have led to a foreign exchange crisis, including 1) that most lucrative trading opportunities are given to foreigners, 2) excessive imports of vehicles and fuel by consecutive governments, 3) and poor management of the Central Bank.
Clashing with de Silva and Coomaraswamy, Kumarasinghe harshly criticised giving away Hambantota Port, which he called the most strategic asset in Sri Lanka. And, rooted in his own experience in the cosmetics industry, he critiqued the government for deregulating the cosmetics industry in 2015, which allowed the markets to be flooded with toxic products and reduced international demand for Sri Lankan cosmetic exports as a result.
Concluding, Kumarasinghe insisted that no country can be developed by following the instructions of the IMF and the World Bank to the last letter. Instead, he insisted that the domestic private sector would be able to lead the way as long as they are listened to.
We must find and have our own home-made domestic formula to develop the economy by facilitating local entrepreneurs, he said.

Galle GA warns Govt. officials
Galle District Secretary S.T. Kodikara yesterday warned his officers that those who work with politicians to distribute goods during the election period will have strict disciplinary and legal action taken against them.
He told the Daily News, that since the election period has now been declared, a government officer can in no way involve a politician in the distribution of goods funded by the Central Fund.
It has to be carried out by the government officer. If at any point, a politician not contesting the election participates in an event, then representatives of all parties need to be invited to the event. In addition, any speech given by them cannot promote a single party or candidate standing for the election, Kodikara said.
He stressed that he will be taking legal and disciplinary action against government officers who do not adhere to the election laws during this period.
The District Secretarys stance comes in the backdrop of Former Secretary to the President and senior most government servant of the previous regime, Lalith Weeratunge having been found guilty in September this year of misappropriating Rs 600 million worth funds belonging to the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority to distribute Sil cloth to devotees during the last Presidential election.

GDP grows by 3.3 percent
The GDP growth rate for the third quarter of 2017 has slowed to 3.3 percent compared to the same quarter last year, the Department of Census and Statistics said in a statement yesterday. GDP growth in December 2016 stood at 4.6 percent, official data shows.
The Census Department said that agricultural activities continue to suffer, mainly due to the unfavourable weather conditions of periods of severe drought pocketed with heavy rainfall.
Two sectors in particular, though, have shown signs of rebound. Tea and rubber growing reported significant positive growth rates, census data shows, bucking a three-year trend.
Growing of rice, fruit, coconut, vegetables, spices and marine fishing have decreased in value, however.
Industrial activities expanded marginally, particularly in the construction and manufacturing sectors.
Significantly, service activities grew at a faster rate than the same quarter last year, especially in the financial services, telecommunication, health and human services and insurance sectors.

Government overcame all economic difficulties: PM
Proper economic management policies adopted by the government have enabled the country to overcome the debilitating effects of the unfavourable climatic conditions experienced in recent times. If not for the government led by President Maithripala Sirisena, the country would never have been able to overcome the economic difficulties caused by the adverse weather conditions, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister made this observation addressing a meeting which followed the opening of the new building of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment at Ratnapura new town on December 16.
The Prime Minister said the country's economy was in shambles when the government led by President Maithripala Sirisena assumed power in 2015. The national income was woefully inadequate to service the colossal amount of foreign loans obtained by the previous regime. But proper economic management policies adopted by the government had enabled the country to settle the problem relating to debt servicing.
Wickremesinghe said prices of essential food items had escalated due to a shortfall in local production caused by the inclement weather conditions experienced last year and early this year. Taking this into cognizance the government had decided to provide a relief package of 8 essential food items including rice, sugar, sprats, canned fish, potatoes and big onions at a fair and affordable price through Sathosa outlets and the private sector shops and trading establishments. These items would reach the people at grass roots level within the coming fortnight.
The Prime Minister said the country was expected to achieve an economic growth rate of 5.5 percent to 6 percent this year. Although the industrial and service sectors had shown much progress, the agriculture sector had been affected due to adverse weather conditions. The agriculture sector therefore, recorded a growth rate of minus 1.2 percent. This had resulted in the reduction of the overall growth rate to 4 to 4.2 percent.
The Prime Minister said the climatic conditions that would prevail next year cannot be predicted. As such, the Disaster Management Minister had suggested that we should lay more emphasis on the development of industrial and service sectors to overcome any shortfall caused by the agriculture sector. The industrial sector would be developed by setting up new factories from Hambantota up to Kandy. The Embilipitiya area would also become an industrial zone in the near future as he emphasised to Ministers John Amaratunge and Thalatha Athukorale during a recent discussion.
The Prime Minister said steps had been taken to develop industrial zones in Kurunegala and Kalutara districts. Much progress was also expected in the service and tourism sectors. It was hoped to reduce the price of Aviation fuel supplied to Aircrafts serviced in Sri Lanka, in order to attract more tourist groups to the country.
The government has also planned to set up tea factories fed by solar energy. This would help to maintain tea factories with a lesser workforce.
The Prime Minister said the new SLBFE office opened at Ratnapura new town would provide a proper training to people seeking foreign employment. Foreign job seekers would be able to increase their per capita income by obtaining the NVQ certificate from this centre. Countries such as the Philippines implemented foreign employment programmes with the objective of increasing per capita income. Sri Lanka too would pursue this objective during the coming years.
The Prime Minister said the dedicated efforts made by Minister Thalatha Athukorale had helped to bring benefits and development to the Ratnapura district.
The contribution made in this regard by Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne should also be highly appreciated.
The government had decided to request proposals from companies named for the Ratnapura Express way projects. A final decision on this matter would reach the Cabinet for approval early next year. Work on the project would commence thereafter. Funding the first stage of this project up to Ingiriya would not be a problem, the Prime Minister said.

IMF programme critical to mitigate macroeconomic risks - Moodys
Moodys Investors Service says that Sri Lankas (B1 negative) high general government debt levels, very low debt affordability, and fragile external payments position continue to present the sovereign with material credit challenges.
In particular, persistently high government liquidity and external vulnerability risks will maintain pressure on the sovereigns credit profile, as large external payments come due in 2019-2022.
Looking ahead, continued advancement of reforms that support fiscal consolidation and reduce external vulnerabilities under Sri Lankas current IMF program will be critical to mitigating macroeconomic risks and strengthening the sovereigns credit profile.
Moodys analysis is contained in its just-released report titled Government of Sri Lanka: FAQ on fiscal reforms, and exposure to liquidity and external vulnerability risks. The report provides Moodys view on the following three questions, Have recent fiscal reforms improved Sri Lankas sovereign credit profile What is your assessment of government liquidity and external vulnerability risks, Will Sri Lankas GDP growth contain credit risks
On the issue of whether fiscal reforms in Sri Lanka have improved the sovereigns credit profile, Moodys says that material near-term improvements in the countrys fiscal strength are unlikely.
Moodys explains that beside the implementation of the Inland Revenue Act, aimed at broadening the tax base through a simplification of the tax system, more sustained fiscal consolidation will be challenging.
Moreover, contingent liability risks related to state-owned enterprises will persist.
Moodys also points out that Sri Lankas low tax efficiency and tax collection methods provide significant scope to broaden the tax base, increase tax revenue and eventually lower its elevated debt burden, which was equivalent to just under 80% of GDP in 2017.
Ongoing revenue reforms under the IMF program, particularly in tax policy and administration, will support a gradual decline in the debt burden over the medium term.
Moreover, particularly large external maturities are due in 2019-2022. With significant market access required to refinance maturing debt including a sizeable portion denominated in foreign currency government liquidity and external vulnerability risks will remain elevated.
Moodys points out that an ongoing accumulation of reserves and implementation of an effective, predictable and transparent liability management strategy would support the sovereign credit profile, by reducing uncertainty around the cost of future refinancing.
With the question of whether Sri Lankas GDP growth contains credit risks, Moodys says that the countrys growth potential and relatively large economy and high income levels when compared with similarly rated sovereigns provide the economy with some shock absorption capacity and will help limit some of the risks from its high debt burden.

Islamic State attacks Kabul intelligence training centre
AGHANISTAN: The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for an attack on an intelligence agency training facility in the Afghan capital on Monday.
Two IS attackers raid the Afghan intelligence centre in Kabul, the jihadists propaganda arm Amaq reported.
Nasrat Rahim, a deputy interior ministry spokesman, said the sound of large and small arms fire could be heard from the fighting.
Roads to the area were closed and dozens of police and intelligence officers were blocking access to the public.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet.
The Afghan capital has become one of the deadliest places in the war-torn country for civilians in recent months, as the resurgent Taliban and increasingly the Islamic State group both step up their attacks.
Security in Kabul has been ramped up since May 31 when a massive truck bomb ripped through the citys diplomatic quarter, killing about 150 and wounding around 400 people, mostly civilians.
Mondays attack represents another blow to beleaguered Afghan forces.
The Taliban have targeted military installations in recent months, including a spate of attacks in October that killed around 150 people.
Afghan forces, already beset by desertions and corruption, have seen casualties soar to what a US watchdog has described as shockingly high levels since NATO forces officially ended their combat mission in 2014.
Morale has been further eroded by long-running fears that the militants have insider help -- everything from infiltrators in the ranks to corrupt Afghan forces selling equipment to the Taliban.

JO, a spent force not sensitive to Muslim issues - Sakaulla
The Muslim community should rally around President Maithripala Sirisena who is a sensitive leader to minoritys issues, a former Western Provincial Councillor representing the Joint Opposition, M.S.M. Sakaulla said.
He has decided to join the Sri Lanka Freedom Party as its new co-organizer of the Negombo electorate yesterday.
The Joint Opposition does not care about the needs of the Muslim community in the country, Sakaulla also added.
Quite contrary to JOs attitude towards the Muslim community, President Maithripala Sirisena was sensitive to Muslims issues. When the JO members were in power, they did not attempt to listen to our problems. It is the same in the JO now, where we were not given any place in the party. Sakaulla pointed out.
Sakaulla also said that the SLFPs decision to give him the co-organizer post to Negombo electorate is a demonstration of the positive way in which the SLFP treats the Muslim community.
Sakaulla was given the co-organizer post to Negombo electorate last Saturday (16).
Sakaulla pointed out that the discussions between JO and SLFP failed because of some JO members who are dreaming of coming to power. These JO members will not receive any powers if the JO and SLFP join. So they do not want the JO to join with the SLFP. We have also lost our confidence over Basil Rajapaksa who initiated the JO. he said.
It is true that we were with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.We tried to bring him to the correct path. We always tried to join these two parties.

Coco
Keeping it in the family
Strumming a time tested tune and flowing along a familiar theme Disney-Pixar has brought yet another family based animation movie to the picture in the form of Coco.
This coming of age story which is directed by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina the story centers on Miguel whom dreams of becoming a musician like his idol Ernesto de la Cruz. Based in Mexico, we are introduced to the Rivera family who makes shoes for a living. However everyone in the family despises anything that has to do with music and had banned it from their roots for generations. The reason for this is a mystery. Desperate to prove his talent, Miguel finds himself in the stunning and colorful Land of the Dead following a mysterious chain of events.
One of Cocos strongest points lie in its vibrant visuals. The beautiful backdrops are a palette of florescent greens, blues, yellows and oranges. There is rich detail and emotion in every frame, from the folds of Dantes hairless body, the textures of the skeletons to the wrinkles in Miguels great-grandmothers face and the vibration of plucked guitar strings. In one episode the detailed animation captures even the thin film of water on Miguels red sweatshirt, as well as the flickering light of the candles lit to welcome the spirits of the dead to this world.
Another plus factor lies in the fact that at times children have to choose between pursuing their dreams and their family. This topic relates to every child who is wishing to follow his or her dream and also for adults to look back on their childhood pursuits with nostalgia. This makes it a film which is a journey as much for its protagonist as it is for the audience.
Plenty of wisecracks follow and some of them are genuinely funny. The tunes too are quite infectious so you might find yourself humming them at leisure. Coco might not be Pixars best product and though their recent productions seem monotonous, one fact remains stable in almost all their work. They have the ability to address the audiences emotions and thus, the films are quite watchable.
Though there is hardly anything unique about Coco one cannot help liking it because of its generous, heartfelt essence. Plus though it is much hackneyed, it is also an apt tribute to the importance of family ties.

LG polls on February 10
The Local Government elections will be held on February 10, 2018, Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya announced yesterday.
The gazette notification with regard to date will be issued on December 26, he said.
Deshapriya said the due date to submit the postal vote applications for public servants who will be engaging in election duty ends at mid night December 22 and he urged them not to wait till the last minute to send their applications.
Addressing a media briefing held at the Elections Secretariat, he urged government servants not to post any application after December 21.
If anybody wants to submit an application after 21, it should be handed over to the closest elections office as soon as possible.
For the first time in the history, the counting of Local Government Election votes of some wards will take place at polling centers and a decision has also been taken to count the votes of two or three polling stations at one location within the ward.
The Chairman said that he would not hesitate to take the decision of annulling the result of any counting center where there is any incident of tampering with the election result or damaging public property.
He said posters of candidates can be displayed only at their campaign offices and vehicles with campaign stickers are permitted only if the candidate is using the vehicle at any given point.
The second phase of accepting nominations for the Local Government Election commenced yesterday morning expecting nominations for 248 Local Government bodies.
The acceptance of nominations for 93 Local Government bodies concluded last Thursday after commencing on December 11.
The nomination submission period for the second phase concludes at noon on Thursday December 21, while nomination lists will only be accepted by Returning Officers between 8:30 a.m. and 4:15 p.m.
The Chairman requested all political parties and independent groups to ensure the nomination lists are filled according to the stipulated criteria to avoid rejection. Speaking about the rejection of several nomination lists handed over by various political parties and independent groups, he said that out of the total of 497 nomination lists received only 23 have been rejected. He said that the main reason for rejecting most of these lists was the failure to hand over within the allotted time period.
He further said that the commission will not challenge anybodys right to go to court and challenge the rejection of nominations lists. He also said that certain nominations lists were rejected as they were not handed over by the persons authorized to do so.
He said nominations should be handed over by the party secretary or authorised agent. For independent groups it is the group leader. A candidate who is contesting the election can hand over the nominations only if he informed in writing earlier.
He further added that some nominations were rejected because they were handed over during certain auspicious times, and not during the allotted time frame.
The Chairman stressed that none of the nomination lists were rejected by Returning Officers because they like to reject and the returning officers are there to accept the nominations and not to reject them.
Making any statement insulting women candidates is completely prohibited and legal action would be taken against anybody involved in such acts, Deshapriya said.

L.H. METTANANDA - THE FORGOTTEN BUDDHIST HERO
It is strange that the 50th death anniversary of Buddhist revivalist L.H. Mettananda went almost unnoticed, even at Ananda College where he was Principal from 1945 to 1953. We wonder whether the present generation of Anandians is even aware of his contributions to the school and Buddhist rights in general.
Mettananda passed away at the age of 73 on November 1, 1967.
In May this year a reader calling himself Ratnapala commenting on an article on him in the Lanka Web, wrote:
Whats become of the present day Anandians and Nalandians  Only a few are left of those glorious Anandians tutored by Messrs. L H Mettananda, Col G W Rajapakse and the like. This is not to belittle the Ranaviruwos led by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa who masterminded the victory over Tamil Racist Terrorism in Sri Lanka.
I have met many an Anandian, Nalandian and many more from the Buddhist schools that came into being during Col Olcott/ Anagraika Dharmapala times.
Educational institutions
I found it strange that I could meet only a few, who had an affinity for the values that Col Olcott and Anagarika Dharmapala would have loved to see from those schooled from these educational institutions. The most disappointing trait was their readiness to follow everything that is Royal / S. Thomas / Trinity  literally all western values  a kind of dog like devotion to their ways and manners. Beginning with big matches, old boy organisations, get-togethers and famously dinner-dances, they blindly follow the ethos of Royal / S. Thomas / Trinity and St Bridgets et al. They hardly had any pride for their country, history, culture or even Buddhism.
Lokusathu Hewa Mettananda  better known as L.H. Mettananda  was born on March 19, 1894 at Kalawadumulla, Ambalangoda. He was the guiding spirit behind the Buddhist Commission Report that accelerated the United National Partys ignominious defeat in the 1956 Parliamentary Elections, reducing that partys number of seats in Parliament to eight.
Mettananda noticed that the Prime Minister D.S. Senanayakes Government was neither prepared to give Government patronage to Buddhism as in the pre-colonial days nor was it keen to give to the Buddhists the same rights the Christians enjoyed in all spheres of society. Had the UNP rulers been far-sighted enough to enforce at least the latter policy, this country would have been spared of the many upheavals that followed. It is very unfortunate that UNP election manifestos failed to focus on the restoration of the rights of the majority which were trampled en masse by the British Raj.
Mettanandas invaluable contribution
If not for Mettanandas invaluable contribution, the watershed in Sri Lankas post-independence period i.e. 1956, which led to the socio-cultural emancipation of the vast majority of the people of this country, would not have been possible. Though front line politicians grabbed the lions share of the power and glory for the nations huge turn around in 1956, posterity is likely to concede a much greater share of credit to Mettananda and the Buddhist movement that he led in the first two decades following independence in 1948, for the sweeping changes that took place in the religious, educational and cultural spheres.
Among the many contenders to shoulder the mantle of Anagarika Dharmapalas legacy and to continue his work to restore Buddhism to its due place in Lankan society particularly in the difficult transitional phase of the countrys history is L.H. Mettananda.
He gave voice to the calls of the Buddhists to re-establish a Buddhist Social Order as existed in the pre-colonial period, though has not materialized to date due to the machinations of anti-Buddhist forces and other dubious elements.

Malaysia to speed up FTA talks
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak speaking to President Maithripala Sirisena said Malaysia would explore every possibility to ensure the increase Sri Lankan exports to Malaysia.
Malaysia has invested US$ 3.1 billion in 47 projects in Sri Lanka and Malaysian entrepreneurs are looking into many sectors of potential investments, the Prime Minister said.
Premier Razak said bilateral trade had steadily grown in the last few years and during the first 10 months of this year, bilateral trade has reached US$680 million. However trade was heavily balanced in Malaysias favour.
Hence, Malaysia would explore every possibility to ensure the increase of Sri Lankan exports to Malaysia, he assured.
The Prime Minister said the proposed Free Trade Agreement would be useful to further expand trade and said his ministers would take steps to speed up talks on FTA.
President Sirisena who thanked the Malaysian Prime Minister for the continuous support extended to Sri Lanka at the UNHRC and other international fora, expressed his agreement to the Malaysian PMs view.
The two leaders also agreed to improve relations in the fields of trade and investment, agriculture, science and technology including nano and bio technology, e-commerce, e-courts, international forums, military training, diplomatic training and intelligence exchange to curb drugs and human smuggling.
Three agreements were signed after the bilateral talks held between the two leaders, in which, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and a number of Malaysian and Sri Lankan ministers also participated. The bilateral meeting was held at the Presidential Secretariat, yesterday (18).
The Prime Minister of Malaysia undertook this official visit to Sri Lanka to mark the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries and a special stamp and a First day Cover were issued to mark this occasion.
Two Memorandums of Understanding on Training of Diplomats and Cooperation in Foresight and Science-2-Action and Memorandum of Collaboration between Coordinating Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation of Sri Lanka and Malaysian Bio-economy Development Cooperation SDN BHD were signed between the two countries.
Ministers John Amaratunge, Tilak Marapana, Rajitha Senaratne, Susil Premajayantha, Malik Samarawickrema, Gayantha Karunatilake and Thalatha Athukorale, Secretaries to the President and Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary and several Malaysian Ministers, advisors and senior officials were present during the bilateral discussion.

Sri Lanka would send a high powered delegation to Russia end of the week to hold talks with Russian authorities in a bid to find a way out of the temporary ban imposed by Russia on Sri Lanka tea imports.
Minister Naveen Dissananyake said that the Sri Lanka Tea Board in Russian and Sri Lankan Ambassador in Russia, Dr. Saman Weerasinghe are currently holding talks with the Russian authorities. The outcome of these talks would be known by Wednesday and then I will fly to Russia to iron out this issue, the Minister said.
Representatives from the Ministry of Plantations, Tea Research Institute Tea Board and Tea Exporters Association would be included in this delegation. The ban is a result of the detection of a single specimen of an agricultural pest, the beetle, Trogoderma granarium in the packaging material of a consignment of tea shipped from Sri Lanka. While imposing these restrictions on Sri Lanka, the Russian authorities have made it explicitly clear that they are of a temporary nature and will last only until the completion of negotiations and clarification of the situation with the competent authority of Sri Lanka.

Money doesnt buy happiness
All the Money in the World is an upcoming historical drama film directed by Ridley Scott and written by David Scarpa, based on John Pearson's 1995 book Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J. Paul Getty. It stars Michelle Williams, Christopher Plummer, Mark Wahlberg, Romain Duris, Andrew Buchan, and Timothy Hutton. The film tells the story of J. Paul Getty's refusal to cooperate with the extortion demands of a group of kidnappers, from the organized crime Mafia group 'Ndrangheta, who abducted his grandson John Paul Getty III in the 1970s.
The movie follows the kidnapping of 16-year-old John Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer) and the desperate attempt by his devoted mother Gail (Michelle Williams) to convince his billionaire grandfather (Christopher Plummer) to pay the ransom. When Getty Sr. refuses, Gail attempts to sway him as her son's captors become increasingly volatile and brutal. With her son's life in the balance, Gail and Getty's advisor (Mark Wahlberg) become unlikely allies in the race against time that ultimately reveals the true and lasting value of love over money. The old adage about money not buying happiness is noble and all, but most of us secretly recognize it would be a relief to have more green; Enough to pay off those bills or save up for the kids college or finally go on a real vacation. All the Money in the World takes on our perceptions about money and its power in the hands of good and bad alike.
All the Money in the World screens at Majestic Cineplex at 10.15 am, 1.15 pm, 4.15 pm, 7.15 pm, and Fri/Sat at 10.15 pm. Empire Cineplex at 1.15 pm, 4.15 pm, 7.15 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.15 pm and Sat/Sun at 10.15 am.

Moodys explains Sri Lankas B1 negative rating
Sri Lankas (B1 negative) high general government debt, very low debt affordability, and fragile external payments position continue to present material credit challenges.
In particular, persistently high government liquidity and external vulnerability risks will maintain pressure on the sovereign credit profile as large external payments come due in 2019-2022. Continued advancement of reforms that support fiscal consolidation and reduce external vulnerabilities under Sri Lanka's current IMF program will be critical to mitigating macroeconomic risks and strengthening the credit profile moving forward.
Have recent fiscal reforms improved Sri Lankas sovereign credit profile
Sri Lanka's low tax efficiency and tax collection methods provide significant scope to broaden the tax base, increase its tax revenue/GDP ratio (13.5% in 2017) and eventually lower its elevated debt burden (just under 80% of GDP in 2017).
Ongoing revenue reforms under the IMF program, particularly in tax policy and administration, will support a gradual decline in the debt burden over the medium term. However, beside the implementation of the Inland Revenue Act - aimed at broadening the tax base through a simplification of the tax system - more sustained fiscal consolidation will be challenging. Moreover, contingent liability risks related to state-owned enterprise (SOE) will persist. As a result, material near-term improvements in Sri Lanka's fiscal strength are unlikely.
What is your assessment of government liquidity and external vulnerability risks
While gradually narrower deficits will help reduce Sri Lankas sizeable refinancing needs, they are unlikely to narrow materially due to its very high level of debt and relatively short maturities. Moreover, particularly large external maturities are due in 2019-22.
With significant market access required to refinance maturing debt, including a sizeable portion denominated in foreign currency, government liquidity and external vulnerability risks will remain elevated. Ongoing accumulation of reserves and implementation of an effective, predictable and transparent liability management strategy would support the sovereign credit profile by reducing uncertainty around the cost of future refinancing.
Will Sri Lanka's GDP growth contain credit risks
Sri Lanka's growth potential and relatively large economy and high income levels compared with similarly rated sovereigns provide the economy with some shock absorption capacity and will help limit some of the risks from the country's high debt burden.
If successful, government efforts to develop and promote exports, foreign direct investment and tourism would stimulate sustained higher growth over the medium to longer term and help mitigate balance of payments pressures, thereby reducing external vulnerability risk.
Q1. Have recent fiscal reforms improved Sri Lanka's sovereign credit profile
Sri Lanka's narrow revenue base and high debt burden are credit constraints. Whilst the government is implementing a number of measures, we do not think that politically- and economically-achievable fiscal consolidation will be large enough to significantly alter the sovereign's fiscal strength.
As part of its three-year IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program, the government aims to achieve fiscal consolidation through revenue measures. It raised the VAT rate to 15% from 11% and is now in the process of reforming income tax.
The program targets a reduction in the general government fiscal deficit to 3.5% of GDP by 2020 from 7.6% in 2015. To achieve this, the IMF estimates that Sri Lanka will need a primary surplus of about 2.2% of GDP by 2020 from a primary balance of about 0.0% in 2017 and a primary deficit of 2.2% in 2015. Thus far, the government has made material progress in advancing fiscal consolidation, driven mainly by the VAT rate hike and tax administration reforms that enhance collection.
Sri Lanka's low tax efficiency and tax collection methods provide significant further scope to broaden the tax base and increase the tax revenue/GDP ratio, which was only 13.5% in 2017. Total government revenues (combined tax and non-tax) are also very low, with a general government revenue/GDP ratio of only about 14.8% in 2017, one of the lowest amongst the sovereigns that we rate.
The new Inland Revenue Act (IRA) is an important benchmark reform in Sri Lankas IMF EFF program that will replace the existing income tax law with a more efficient and broad-based tax framework. It is scheduled for implementation in April 2018. The government expects the new IRA to help drive an approximate 0.5% of GDP increase in government revenues in 2019, following its first full year of implementation, and the IMF estimates that it could add up to 2.0% of GDP in additional government revenues over the medium term.
If the government's revenue reforms, including the new IRA, are implemented successfully, we expect general government revenues to increase to just over 15% by 2018. The IMF projects revenues to rise further to over 16% of GDP by 2021. Overall, the governments revenue reforms will play an important role in bolstering fiscal consolidation given Sri Lanka's weak fiscal position, the need for public spending on infrastructure and development programs, and political constraints in restraining expenditure.
Debt burden to decline gradually over the medium term, albeit remaining at high levels
Persistent large budget deficits, combined with slower nominal GDP growth, have resulted in a rise in general government debt to 79.6% of GDP in 2017 according to our estimates, up from its recent low of about 69% in 2012.
As a result of recent fiscal consolidation efforts, we expect Sri Lankas general government debt to stabilize near current levels through 2018, before declining gradually thereafter. While we expect the policymaking process to remain slow, due to the need for consensus building, we believe that the commitment to fiscal consolidation is in place. Nonetheless, the debt burden will remain well above the
median of about 55% for B-rated sovereigns and at a high level for an economy of the size and income levels of Sri Lanka's.
Moreover, a number of financially strained SOEs with sizeable liabilities pose additional risks to the government's balance sheet, should financial support be needed. The IMF estimates that non financial SOE debt is worth nearly 12% of GDP. SOE reforms including the Statement of Corporate Intents and impending energy pricing reforms underpin the efforts to reduce fiscals risks to the government. At
this stage, the effective implications of the reforms for SOEs' financial strength is unclear. Crystallization of some contingent liabilities could add significant fiscal costs.
Q2. What is your assessment of government liquidity and external vulnerability risks
The maturity and currency structure of Sri Lanka's government debt give rise to significant liquidity and external risks. Alongside with fiscal consolidation, these areas are a focus of the IMF programme. Liquidity and external vulnerability will be tested in 2019-22 when external debt maturities are particularly large.
Sri Lanka's persistent annual fiscal deficits and large debt with short maturities result in a gross government borrowing requirement (GBR) of about 19% of GDP in 2017, according to the IMF. While gradually narrower deficits will help reduce GBRs, Sri Lankas sizeable refinancing needs are unlikely to narrow materially. Overall, we expect GBRs to remain broadly stable at high levels well above the
10.3% of GDP median level for B1 and B2-rated sovereigns.
Directly related to large GBRs, Sri Lankas vulnerability to changes in external financing conditions is significant, as external and foreign currency debt accounts for about 43% of total government debt.
Sri Lanka is in the process of finalizing a new Liability Management Act that will provide the government with greater flexibility on managing future debt payments. The act is part of a revised liability management strategy that intends to provide the government with increased flexibility around its annual borrowing ceiling, to better manage future repayments; address rollover risks and the bunching of repayments through extension of maturities; apply new debt management techniques (such as buy backs and switching); and update the bond issuance system.
The government expects to introduce the legislative bill to Parliament this month and hopes to enact it early in 2018. However, while the government is taking steps toward addressing elevated external risks, it is far from certain that such measures will be sufficient to stave off rising balance of payments pressures.
At the same time, the Central Bank (CBSL) aims to improve the composition of reserves by winding down some swap lines with commercial banks and purchasing foreign exchange directly from the market. Already, CBSL's reliance on swap lines has declined materially from around $3.3 billion in March 2016 to an estimated $1.8 billion as of end 2017. Nonetheless, at nearly one quarter of total foreign-currency reserves, commercial swaps still represent a sizable portion of central bank reserves, exposing reserves to potential rollover risk. We expect the reliance on such swaps to continue to decline, though renewed pressure from capital outflows would jeopardise the credit positive trend.
Despite recent reserve accumulation, external vulnerability risk will remain elevated
Supported by bond issuances (including a syndicated loan) and exchange rate flexibility, foreign exchange reserves (excluding gold and SDRs) have increased to $6.5 billion as of October 2017. Moving forward, we expect foreign currency reserves to rise to about $7.5 billion in 2018, following the completion of the Hambantota Port sale to a Chinese company. The sale will add about $1 billion in total to reserves by the middle of 2018. However, given the large volume of external liabilities due from 2019-2021, we expect reserves to remain around the $7.5 billion level thereafter.
As a result, Sri Lankas external vulnerability indicator (EVI), which measures the ratio of external debt payments due over the next year to foreign-exchange reserves, will remain elevated, rising from around 152% in 2016 to about 187% in 2017. The EVI will decline next year with no international sovereign bond payments due, but it will pick up again in 2019.
As a further illustration of low reserves coverage, the following chart shows the level of reserves that would be required to reduce Sri Lankas EVI to 100% - where reserves fully cover short-term liabilities and maturing long-term liabilities - and to match the median level of reserves coverage amongst B1-rated sovereigns.
Q3. Will Sri Lanka's GDP growth contain credit risks
Sri Lanka's growth potential, relatively large economy and high income levels compared with similarly rated sovereigns provide the economy with some shock absorption capacity and help limit some of the risks from the country's high debt burden. If successful, government efforts to develop and promote exports, foreign direct investment and tourism would stimulate sustained higher growth over the medium to longer term and help mitigate balance of payments pressures.
Sri Lankas economic strength metrics are strong relative to most B1 and B2 sovereigns
Sri Lanka's relatively large economy and income levels compared to B-rated sovereigns and robust real GDP growth drive our Moderate (+) assessment of Sri Lanka's economic strength. In 2007-16 the country's 10-year average growth rate was 5.9%, and we expect real GDP growth to moderate to a still robust average rate of about 4.9% per year in 2017-21.
In the shorter term, GDP growth has been affected by severe droughts and flooding in 2017. Longer term, the government's pursuit of economic and structural reforms under its current IMF program will foster economic gains through improvements in productivity and competitiveness. We expect real GDP growth to recover to about 5.0% by 2019.
Growth potential supported by trade and foreign investment
The concentration of exports in a few sectors increases Sri Lanka's sensitivity to competition and sector-specific shocks; the EU fish import ban in 2015 is a prominent example of the latter. However, the medium-term outlook has improved following lifting of trade restrictions and GSP+ access in the EU, which is Sri Lanka's biggest export market.
Sri Lanka's strategic location along key shipping routes positions it well to benefit from increased trade, especially in South Asia. Sri Lanka has already expanded its port capacity. Moreover, the government is actively pursuing Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with multiple trade partners, including China and Singapore.
If such agreements are successfully signed and implemented, they will support gains in Sri Lanka's export market share. Meanwhile, the country's geographic location and relatively strong socioeconomic indicators are two factors favoring domestic and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in principle. However, net FDI, at 1.2% of GDP in 2016 remains low overall and compared to peers. To promote FDI, and in line with many governments in the region and emerging markets in general, the government is streamlining tax laws, improving the investment climate by implementing a single-window system for foreign investment applications, and instituting trade reforms which include strengthening the trade policy framework and improving the export competitiveness of local businesses.
The government is also steering several large development projects, which should attract private investment and support economic growth over the medium term, including the Western Region Megapolis Plan, Colombo Financial City Project and Hambantota industrial zone. We expect the economic benefits of FDI to materialize gradually.
For example, while the Colombo Financial City Project, which China is building and financing, will provide direct support to investment, the wider economic benefits of the project are thus far uncertain.

Nepali voters choose left alliance in rebuke to India
Even before the final count is in, supporters of Nepal's communist coalition sniffed victory in a landmark election held over two stages, on Nov. 26 and Dec. 7, and have begun celebrating. The sound of drums echoed in a historic corner of Kathmandu, the capital of the mountainous nation, and packs of communist loyalists, astride motorcycles, and waving party flags, roared down narrow lanes.
Former Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli, leader of the Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist (UML), is tipped to become premier again, since the UML is the senior partner in the left alliance, which also includes the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Center. This left-turn by the country of 29 million people has raised the question of whether the Nepalese are joining other South Asians in giving a cold shoulder to India, the sub-region's giant, and embracing China instead.
Khadga Prasad Oli
Nepal's apparent pro-China tilt is likely to alarm the Indian political establishment, in the wake of the erosion of the country's influence elsewhere in the region.
Votes counted a week after the second stage of the elections, the first under a new constitution, have assured the leftists of at least 113 of the 165 seats up for grabs in the direct vote. A leftist sweep is also forecast in the count for the proportional representation votes for the remaining 110 seats. The leftists are also expected to win six of the seven provincial polls -- a first in Nepal, as it moves towards a federal system. The Nepali Congress (NC), the centrist, establishment and more pro-India party, is licking its wounds after so far winning only 21 seats in the lower house.
The domestic implications of the result are unequivocal. The votes represents a rejection of the Himalayan nation's rocky political path, which has produced 25 governments during the last 30 years and included a 10-year bloody insurgency led by the Maoists, which left over 16,000 people dead. The voters clearly opted for the development agenda that the leftists campaigned on. The result assures the coalition of at least two years of stability, guaranteed under the new constitution, but also holds the promise that it can complete a full five-year term -- a first in the landlocked country sandwiched between India and China.
Nepal's political affairs
The voters rejected the message of fear that the NC tried to press home. If communist forces rule the country, democracy will vanish, the NC's leader and incumbent Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba warned at party rallies. He received encouragement from press reports in India, which claimed China had stealthily stitched together the left alliance ahead of the polls.
However, Oli's inner circle say that this message backfired. Oli profited from the political capital he earned by standing up to India, which has a long record of meddling in Nepal's political affairs, during his first stint as prime minister from October 2015 to August 2016. That period was marked by a crippling blockade of essentials such as oil, fuel and cooking gas from India to Nepal, one of South Asia's poorest countries.
The perception in Nepal, although denied by the Indian establishment, was that the blockade was an Indian ploy to back the aspirations of Nepal's Madhesis, a people of Indian ancestry living in the lowlands along the Nepali-Indian border. Rather than kowtow to India, Oli turned to China for help, signing a 15-point agreement that covered oil, trade and investment in big-ticket infrastructure projects. The UML played up this record on the campaign trail.
We are very much clear about the independence of Nepal and our sovereignty has to be respected, Agni Kharel, former minister of law, justice and parliamentary affairs in Oli's government, told the Nikkei Asian Review. We are not against India nor are we pro-China, he said, adding that the backdrop of anti-Indian feelings leading to the vote was not our creation.
Nepali business leaders are not surprised by India's receding political influence. The impact of the blockade -- the third of its kind imposed by India since the early 1970s -- was felt across the country. This stoked anti-Indian feelings that were 100% reflected in this election, said Rameshwor Thapa, former president of the Airlines Association of Nepal. People still remember that overland travel became impossible and tourism, which many depend on for income, dropped.
The Nepali rebuke comes as the political tide is also turning away from India in the Maldives, at the other end of South Asia. There, the increasingly authoritarian President Abdulla Yameen has turned to China for economic help as he heads into 2018, when a presidential election is due. It is a shift not lost on the Maldivian Democratic Party, the parliamentary opposition which is aiming to challenge Yameen. The government has been very open about its pro-China polices, marked by a foreign policy shift that it is changing towards the East, said Hamid Abdul Ghafoor, the MDP's international spokesperson.
Busiest shipping lane in the Indian Ocean
India is also competing for influence in Sri Lanka. Although the current coalition government in Sri Lanka triumphed in a shock election victory nearly three years ago, by appearing pro-Indian, it has turned to China for an economic lifeline. This month, the Sri Lankan government handed over a strategic port on the country's southern coast to a Chinese company on a 99-year lease. The debt-for-equity swap for the $1.12 billion port gives China a beachhead overlooking the busiest shipping lane in the Indian Ocean. The agreement has a provision that prevents any other country from developing other ports within 100 kilometres, said Premachandra Athukorala, Professor of Economics at the Australian National University in Canberra.
New Delhi will view all this happening in its neighbourhood as a threat to India, said Karna Adhikary, former Nepali ambassador to India and Bhutan. But in responding, it cannot subjugate the sovereignty of its neighbours and hurt them, he added.
The result revealed what happens when India takes steps to facilitate its own political influence outside its borders, and sometimes tends to go beyond reasonable limits, Adhikary said.

No interference in Judiciary- CJ
Chief Justice Priyasad Dep emphatically stated that the countrys Judiciary is running independently without any interference.
He further said due to this situation, the country could be pleased with the existing supremacy of the law as well as the independence of the judiciary.
The Chief Justice made these observations yesterday addressing the annual assembly of the Judicial Service Association at the Galadari Hotel in Colombo.
Chief Justice Dep further said that although the Judiciary is independent, there is a delay in the law. He added that the Judiciary is not solely responsible for this delay.
He pointed out the escalating number of crimes, lack of ample facilities and the shortage of judges too contributes to the delay of the law. The Chief Justice further said that a Parliamentary Select Committee has been appointed to look into this matter and members of the Committee too have a wide knowledge on the matter. The Chief Justice also pointed out that measures have been taken to increase the number of High Court Judges while it is imperative that the number of the Supreme Court Judges also be increased..
The Chief Justice also pointed out that modern technology should be used to minimise the backlog of cases.
He added that Sri Lanka could look into the type of technology used in Malaysia in this connection and have it introduced to the Sri Lankan judiciary.
This would considerably help reduce the backlog of cases.
Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala, Justice Ministry Secretary W.M.M.R.Adikari and Judicial Service Association President Ranga Dissanayake were also present on the occasion.

Since no party will be able to gain a clear majority of seats at the forthcoming local government elections, two parties may have to join hands to form the administration in many local councils, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S.B. Dissanayake said.
The SLFP may have to team up with the UNP or the Pohottuwa party to do this, he said.
The Minister was addressing a meeting of the Hewaheta Kivul Lindapatha SLFP Central Organisation recently.
Dissanayake said the SLFP would be in the government for the next three years without any problem since the term of office of the President will continue for another three years. He said the SLFP had gathered momentum in the political front during the last two weeks following nomination day while the Pohottuwa party had suffered serious setbacks in its popularity.
Almost 50 percent of the former MEP members who supported Dinesh Gunawardene were now with the SLFP, he said.
Under the present circumstances, no party would be able to command 51 percent of the membership of the local councils after the forthcoming election.

Reminiscing on limited overs cricket
It is a common fact that running between the wickets play a major part in one-day cricket, these days. One crucial run out could turn a match on its head, it would be interesting to note how this important aspect of the game played its part, when we go down memory lane a few years back.
The gaps will always be evident and the need is to exploit them. Sachin Tendulkar was a past master at this and he could push and prod when he targeted them, and he was canny enough to take the first run hard when he saw the possibility of another. The maestro Tendulkar who by then has scored the most number of runs was a wonderful example of a batsman who not only looked for the possibility of a second run but a third as well if the fielding was lackadaisical. In his era too which means reminiscing skin deep, the dot ball was acceptable in Test cricket and Tendulkar was a master in pacing his innings with dot balls amongst the many twos, threes, fours and sixes which studded many of his glorious innings. On the contrary, a dot ball in one day cricket could easily make the difference between winning and losing. The crowds loathe seeing even a batsman fresh to the crease playing down dot balls though he tries to get his eye in.
Even then there was a lot more of hitting on the rise on the one day format due to the fact that pitches were prepared for runs and they were true, all this was done due to crowd entertainment. The absence of too many slips accompanying the wicket keeper, as well as restriction in field settings automatically created the scope for what it could be termed unorthodox shots. One of those was the reverse sweep. It was also common to see batsmen going inside out even to balls pitched on the leg stump and hoicking them over the covers, another productive stroke on the offing was the deliberate open faced flick over the slips and the thinly sliced leg glance. To play all these strokes entailed soft hands and supple wrists.
Rajan Bala in his book Glances at perfection stated that it was a matter for speculation as to how many men who played between 1930s and 1970s, would have adapted to the needs of the shorter version of the game. C.K.Naydu, hit a lot of sixes anyway and would have loved this sort of contest. So would have Mushtaq Ali, who played Test cricket like one day cricket, going by what his colleague Rusi Modi had to say. Vijay Merchant for instance employed the late cut which would have been a wonderfully effective stroke. But overall one day cricket is all about power, and here one would have to think of the power players of the past like Nayudu, Lala Amarnath, even Vijay Hazare, Polly Umrigar and Gulbrai Ramchand stated Bala.
Bala noted that batting in this format of the game changed completely after the introduction of the 30-yard semi circles and the stipulation that four fieldsmen, apart from the wicket keeper, have to be within them all the time. In the 1996 World Cup that we won, the likes of Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana took ones breath away by exploiting the 15 over rule when only 2 fieldsmen could be employed outside the circle after 15 overs, the runs just flowed, concluded Bala. In that 1996 World Cup it was stunning to watch Sana and Kalu completely revolutionised the art of batting by going hell for leather in the first 15 overs. It would be interesting to note that if they were playing against the present Indian bowlers who are quite adept at putting the ball in the right areas and getting movement either way could fare. My bet is that either they would have perished or plundered them.
By the way Gurusinha and the boys are riding high in India, ok people might say that the Kholi factor was not there, this could be true as Virat Kholi has had such a bearing on this Indian side and India always ride high when he is there, but unfortunately for India and fortunately for Sri Lanka, Virat Kholi is going to be the The Man of The Match in another scenario, his wedding and I wish him all the best.

Sri Lanka optimistic of Russian tea ban removal
Sri Lanka is optimistic that the Ceylon Tea ban will be lifted by the Russian Federation, said the Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen recently.
I am optimistic of a quick solution, said the Minister after urgent consultations with his top officials on December 17 .
Russia and Sri Lanka have long-standing friendly and cordial relations. This ban is not a refusal of Sri Lanka by Russia, but only a temporary stoppage of one export product from us.
The only reason for our concern is that nearly 80 percent of our exports to Russia is Ceylon Tea.
We praise President Maithripala Sirisena for his prompt action in contacting the highest levels of the Russian government to resolve this. I am optimistic of a quick solution, said Minister Bathiudeen.
Last year Russia ranked as the second largest buyer of all types of Ceylon Teas (including green tea made in Sri Lanka) at $ 143 million, the leading buyer in 2016 was Iran, at $ 154.10 million.
However, in 2015 Russia was the top most buyer of Ceylon Tea at $156.65 million, and the second leading buyer was Turkey.
According Minister Bathiudeens Department of Commerce, nearly 74 percent of Sri Lankas exports to Russia in 2016 was Ceylon Tea at a value of US $ 143 million (while total exports to Russia in the same year was $ 182 million). Over the years, total tea exports to Russia has shown a declining trend, with $ 240.32 million in 2013, $ 228.27 million in 2014, $ 156.65 million in 2015 and $ 142.55 million in 2016.
Ceylon Tea exports to Russia from January to August this year totalled US $ 114.18 million (83% of all types of Lankan exports to Russia from January to August 2017). Other main items that Sri Lanka exports to Russia are apparel, vegetable textile fibres, other clothing accessories (including gloves).
Sri Lankas total trade (both imports and exports) with the Russian Federation which was at US $ 435.83 million in 2015 declined to $ 381.71 million in 2016.
This year from January to August, it reported a total of US $ 260.78 million.

Stray cattle in Ampara cause road accidents
Stray cattle have caused an increase in road accidents in the Ampara district, particularly in its coastal belt.
The cattle should be allowed to loaf about in the pasture's grazing lands (grazing lands) allocated in every division, but this is not done. As a result, the number of accidents occurring in the roads due to stray cattle has increased.
Cattle owners are allegedly not mindful of tethering and maintaining their cattle at the proper places, instead allowing them to loaf about in the highways.
According to some Ampara residents, it is the duty of the Road Development Authority to control the stray cattle, while others say that it is the function of the Local Authorities Bodies. Residents claim that even the police can take action against the stray cattle nuisance, and allege that cattle owners are not worried about the various road accidents that are taking place day to day. Residents request that cattle owners take their cattle to the grazing land in the morning and bring them back to their tethering places at night.
They say that close supervision of the cattle by the cattle owners is needed at this juncture.
The members of the public urge the RDA in Kalmunai and Akkaraipattu and the relevant local authority bodies to take proper action regarding this matter, in the greater interest of the people in the area.

Teaching to say 'No" to drugs
Have we done enough to sensitize the people in general and the youth in particular, to the adverse effects of drugs This question came into this writers mind when he browsed through the report issued by the National Dangerous Drug Control Board on the drug abuse situation in Sri Lanka for 2016.
Last year, 79,378 suspects were arrested for drug-related offences. Almost half of them were from western province. The report says we have around 200,000 cannabis users and 45,000 heroin users. In fact, six months ago, NDDCB Chairman Professor Ravindra Fernando confirmed that over 250,000 people of Sri Lanka are addicted to drugs.
Two prevalent drugs in our country are cannabis and heroin. Cannabis is mainly cultivated illicitly in dry zone of Sri Lanka. In 2016, 4174 kg of cannabis were seized in Sri Lanka. The report does not indicate any details about the estimated annual supply of cannabis distributed within the country. A recent news report indicated that over 50,000 kilos of cannabis are nabbed annually by the Police Anti-narcotics Bureau each year.
NDDCB report indicates the annual supply of heroin in the country as 1478 kg (estimated) about 4 kg per day. It also specifies that the reported number of persons treated for drug abuse island-wide was 2355 in 2016.
The statistics make one thing absolutely clear. We still do have a serious drug abuse problem in Sri Lanka and we need to search for more effective solutions. To start with, we need to find answers to two basic questions. Why is there a drug abuse problem existing in our country What should be done to alleviate it
The causes
The drug abuse is quite a complex phenomenon, which has various social, cultural, biological, geographical, historical and economic aspects. The disintegration of the old joint family system, absence of parental love and care in modern families where both parents are working, decline of old religious and moral values etc. had led to a rise in the number of addicts who take drugs to escape hard realities of life.
Drug abuse is also primarily due to the nature of the drug abused, the personality of the individual and the addicts immediate environment. The processes of industrialization, urbanization and migration have led to loosening of the traditional methods of social control rendering an individual vulnerable to the stresses and strains of modern life. The fast-changing social milieu, among other factors, is mainly contributing to the growth of drug abuse, both of traditional and of new psychoactive substances.
Apart from affecting the financial stability, drug addiction increases conflicts and causes untold emotional pain for every member of the family. With most drug users being in the productive age group of 18-35 years, the loss in terms of human potential is incalculable. The damage to the physical, psychological, moral and intellectual growth of the youth is very high. Adolescent drug abuse is one of the major areas of concern in adolescent and young peoples behaviour.
Women in Sri Lanka face greater problems from drug abuse. The consequences include domestic violence and infection with HIV, as well as the financial burden.
Steps taken
At the national level, drug abuse is intrinsically linked with racketeering, conspiracy, corruption, illegal money transfers, terrorism and violence threatening the very stability of governments.
Sri Lanka has braced itself to face the menace of drug trafficking both at the national and international levels. Several measures involving innovative changes in enforcement, legal and judicial systems have been brought into effect. The introduction of death penalty for drug-related offences has been a major deterrent. The Police Narcotics Bureau has been empowered with stringent provisions to curb this menace. Education Ministry is planning to launch a programme to prevent schoolchildren using narcotics within school premises.
Solutions
Prevention is the best way in which drug abuse can be dealt with. The issue of the prevention of drug abuse should be addressed from various perspectives. As experts point out, psycho-social interventions remain the cornerstone of this prevention programme. Recent years have seen developments both in primary and in early secondary prevention procedures.
Primary prevention of drug abuse is concentrated through community mobilisation and development and dissemination of good practices. The community should actively participate in determining the problems and needs, developing solutions, and implementing and evaluating interventions with the support from professionals.
The secondary prevention focuses on individuals who have developed minimal or no complications related to drug abuse. Brief interventions, many of which are based on the FRAMES (feedback, responsibility, advice, menu of strategies, empathy, and self-efficacy) model, have shown promise, and their easy administration make them particularly attractive for use in countries like us, where trained manpower is scarce.
In fact, drug abuse is one affliction that can be easily prevented if the prevention programmes are aimed to involve entities such as families, schools and the immediate communities.
Media  especially the entertainment segment  also needs to understand its role in this context and play a positive role by resisting the urge to earn millions by romanticizing and glorifying drug abuse. It needs to highlight the damning consequences of drug abuse. It is important that the youth are made to feel that drug usage itself is harmful in every conceivable way and only then will they stop using them and prevent others in their peer group from doing the same.
Sustained treatment is the only option for people who have already gone down the road of drug abuse and are highly into it. It is said that the best treatments normally emphasize on phenomena related to the individuals life.
This includes areas such as medical, psychological and work-related needs as well as issues in relationships with other people in the persons life. The treatment sessions combine medication and behavioural therapy so that the victim of drug abuse gradually stops feeling the urge to do drugs. These treatment programmes also impart the skills and capability required in order to say no to drugs in the future, which is highly critical for a complete cure to drug abuse.
In addition to the facilities in NDDCB, there are a number of Non-Government organisations who are genuinely involved in offering their services. Most of them have their day care facilities which seeks to rehabilitate drug users.
This writer would like to suggest few other steps to be taken by governmental and non-governmental agencies in the area of prevention of drug abuse. One suggestion is the inclusion of information on drug abuse as an obligatory component of the upper school curriculum.
The second suggestion is that Ministry of Health establish few more rehabilitation centres based at the district hospital levels.
The third suggestion is that the time is opportune for the Government, through other agencies and NGOs, undertake a major national study on the current causes, extent, patterns and trends of drug and alcohol abuse in the country. This study can become the basis for a long-term strategic plan for prevention and treatment of drug abuse in Sri Lanka.
Drug abuse can be addressed at the individual level, at the local level (societal, national) and at the cross-national level. At the individual level, there has to be a synthesis of biological understanding with the exploration of background socio-cultural factors.
At the national and cross-national level, there has to be a concerted effort of all the segments of the society in managing the issue of drug abuse, taking into account the local socio-cultural and political scenarios.

Temple thief meets with accident
A thief fleeing after stealing the till of the Minneriya temple next to the Kandalama embankment met with an accident on the Damblla-Kandalama main road, Dambulla police said.
He was admitted to the Dambulla Hospital, police said.
Police found a fertiliser bag fallen from a three-wheeler which crashed into a tree after knocking another vehicle.
The driver of the vehicle informed police that the three wheeler driver and the bag fallen off in the accident.
He has found some coins and several currency notes in the three wheeler and told the police the same.
Dambulla police promptly conducted a special investigation into the accident.
The injured three wheeler driver has confessed to police that he had stolen the money from the till of the temple after breaking it at his home. His son has told police that his father had given him some money from the till.
A police team from the Dambulla police then visited the village of the three wheeler driver in the Inamaluwa area and inspected whether any temple was broken into and found that the till of the Minneriya temple was taken away.
The watcher of the temple was on his way to lodge a complaint about the till when the police visited the place.
The driver has confessed that he was fleeing with the money and the sight of the Dambulla rock caused fear in him and he lost control of the three wheeler leading to the accident.
The suspect was produced before the Dambulla Magistrates court. Investigations are continuing.

Tiger Zinda Hai likely to have a sequel
Tiger franchises second installment is all set to release this week. The film will see Katrina Kaif and Salman Khans reunion after five years.
During an event, Salman Khan revealed about the third installment of the Tiger Franchise, he said, If Ali (Abbas Zafar- director) or Kabir (Khan- filmmaker) decide, then maybe next year well (Salman and Katrina will) be back.
Helmed by Ali Abbas Zafar under the banner of Yash Raj Films, Tiger Zinda Hai is scheduled to release on December 22, 2017.
Earlier this year, during an interview Ali Abbas Zafar spoke about the aura of Salman Khan on silver screens, he stated, Actually, anyone will fall for bhai. Woh ankh utha kar dekhte hai, to sabko unsey pyaar ho jata hai (The moment he lifts his eyes and looks at you, you are surely going to fall in love with him).
The film involves some crucial but perilous action sequences. Talking about the same Ali Abbas Zafar said, Tigers encounter with the wolves marks one of the most important chapters in the film. The idea was to do something which has never been seen on the Indian screen and give Tigers character an edge. This is a very dramatic chase and action sequence that Tiger has with a pack of real wolves.
Hopefully, the film will manage to create a storm at the box office. Until then, fingers crossed for the sequel of Tiger Zinda Hai.
After Tiger Zinda Hai, Salman Khan will be next featured in Race 3 opposite Jacqueline Fernandez, whereas, Katrina Kaif will be seen in Thugs Of Hindostan with Aamir Khan, Amitabh Bachchan and Fatima Sana Sheikh.

True SLFPers should rally round its leader: Duminda
Today a group who entered parliament under the SLFP banner is engaged in promoting a separate political party betraying the mother party and attempting to divide the SLFP, SLFP General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
He noted that from the grass-roots level up to the level of the President, they have all tried their best to unite the two factions for the well-being of the SLFP which was sabotaged as planned by some hypocrites within the party who are trying to gain their lost authority and power by hook or by crook.
He made this comment at an awareness meeting regarding the forthcoming Local Government elections at the Anuradhapura SLFP office.
The minister said any parliamentarian who was found having breached the party constitution would be severely dealt with legally. No one shall be allowed to work against the SLFP, Dissanayake stated.
President Maithripala Sirisena, once he was elected as the Chairman of the SLFP, wanted to ensure that those who destroyed the party would leave it.
However, there were still many issues to be resolved and some of these culprits were still to be held responsible for their actions. A mother who plucked some mangoes and the child who stole a coconut due to hunger, were remanded. But those responsible for national crimes have still not been made accountable for their crimes.
The SLFP would definitely become cleaner and brighter if such bad eggs left the party, he he said.
Dissanayake said a large number of political parties are contesting at the forthcoming Local Government elections, but only the SLFP candidates are in a strong position to develop the villages.
The minister pointed out to the amateur candidates that when former President Chandrika Kumaratunge retired from the office of the President, the members did not grumble that they cannot work without her, since she was instrumental in gaining power for the SLFP which continued to be in the opposition for 17 years.
That, he said, should be made applicable in the case of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. We, the true SLFPers, are duty bound and obliged to rally round the present leader of the SLFP President Maithripala Sirisena in conformity with the SLFP rules and conditions, Dissanayake said.

UNP guarantees good deal from national government for LGs
The United National Party in national government is fixing the mistakes of the past regime to build a stronger economy, because without a strong economy we cannot provide necessary funds to local governments, United National Party (UNP) Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said while welcoming the announcement that the date for the Local Government Elections is set for February 10, 2018.
In the 2018 Budget, the UNP in national government committed over Rs. 25 billion for all activities at the local government level next year so they can develop roads, improve local health amenities, provide clean drinking water and keep garbage off our streets.
Only by voting for the UNP locally can you guarantee a good deal from national government for your area. And only the UNPs carefully selected, honest and educated local candidates have the knowledge and ability to deliver for you and your family.
This election is close and every vote counts. Dont risk the future of your local area by voting for any other candidate or by not voting, which is effectively the same as voting for another party.
So, at the local government elections, make sure you cast your vote for the UNP to secure development in your local area and stick with the UNPs plan to build a stronger economy, the Prime Ministers message said.

Wasps take revenge on La Rochelle, Saracens beaten again
Paris: Elliot Daly starred as Wasps gained revenge for last week's thrashing at La Rochelle by beating the French side 21-3 on Sunday to boost their European Champions Cup hopes, while free-falling holders Saracens were beaten by Clermont.
Wasps throttled French Top 14 leaders La Rochelle in Coventry to gain some payback for a 20-point loss last weekend.
"If we can win our two games we have a chance of squeaking through as we have given ourselves a fighting chance," said Wasps director of rugby Dai Young.
"We possibly missed out on a bonus point today as we controlled the match but not the scoreboard and didn't turn our pressure into points, especially in the first half."
La Rochelle kicked off the game on maximum points after three consecutive bonus-point wins.
Last week the French side produced a brilliant attacking display, but on Sunday they were pinned back by a Wasps team seeking a victory that would keep alive their hopes of advancing. England winger Daly smashed over in the corner to give Wasps the lead after 11 minutes.
He converted the try and did the same after touching down again in the 47th minute.Wasps never allowed the visitors to develop their attacking game and La Rochelle scored their first and only points when Brock James kicked a penalty on the hour mark.
The hosts had the last word when replacement hooker Tom Cruse powered over after a lineout. Danny Cipriani converted but Wasps could not add a fourth try to collect a bonus point.
Despite leaving the Ricoh Arena without even a losing bonus point, La Rochelle remain top of Pool 1, two points ahead of Ulster, who crushed Harlequins on Friday, and five clear of third-place Wasps.
Saracens lose again
Saracens, who were hammered by 32 points at home by Clermont in a weather-delayed game on Monday, saw their poor recent form continue with an agonising 24-21 loss in the second repeat of last year's final in less than a week.
The reigning European champions have now lost seven matches in a row in all competitions. Smarting Saracens raced to a 13-0 lead with a try by Ben Spencer and a conversion and two penalties from Owen Farrell.
Morgan Parra responded with six straight penalties to put the home team five points ahead, but Farrell replied with three points of his own and Alex Lozowski scored an unconverted try to put Sarries back in front.
But in a chaotic and error-filled final 15 minutes, Parra kicked two more penalties to secure the victory which lifted the French club five points clear at the head of Pool 2 and dropped Saracens to third.
"We didn't make a good start and they took us by the throat," said Clermont coach Franck Azema.
"We didn't panic, we came back into the game by focusing on simple things."
Ospreys backed up last weekend's narrow win over Northampton by running in four tries to claim a 32-15 victory in Swansea to pile more misery onto the English sides.All seven Premiership clubs were beaten last week, and Munster won 25-16 at Leicester in Sunday's final match.
The Irish outfit are now four points clear of Racing 92, who beat Castres on Saturday, at the top of Pool 4, with Leicester rooted to the foot of the table. - AFP

Windies pin hopes on Gayle force for New Zealand ODIs
WELLINGTON: The West Indies will hope short-form master Chris Gayle can inspire a misfiring batting line-up in the one-day international series against New Zealand starting on Wednesday.
The tourists meekly surrendered with the bat as they slumped to a 2-0 Test series whitewash against the Black Caps, and need a major improvement in the three ODI games.
Gayle, arriving fresh from a record-breaking stint in the Bangladesh Premier League, promises to inject the aggression and confidence lacking so far during the tour of New Zealand.
He smashed a record 18 sixes in an unbeaten 146 off 69 balls in the BPL final to add to the slew of titles he already holds in the ultra-short form of the game.
Afterwards, the 38-year-old told ESPNCricinfo he was the greatest batsman of all time.
His self-assessment may be debatable but New Zealand paceman Lockie Ferguson said the hosts were well aware of the threat the left-hander from Jamaica poses.
Ferguson said Gayle would need time to adjust to local conditions in the opening ODI at Whangareis Cobham Oval.
He said New Zealands new-ball combination of Tim Southee and Trent Boult would be aiming for an early breakthrough.
Our opening bowlers are extremely good at swinging the ball, so I think theres definitely a challenge for him there, Ferguson told Radio Sport.
Of course, if he gets going then hes one of those world-class batters who can go a long time and score lots of runs. The West Indies, who are ninth in the ODI rankings, will be without batsmen Marlon Samuels (finger) and Sunil Ambris (broken arm) as well as bowler Alzarri Joseph (back).
The fifth-ranked New Zealanders are missing two of their biggest hitters in Martin Guptill (hamstring) and Colin de Grandhomme, who pulled out of the series after the death of his father.
They will also rest captain Kane Williamson and Southee after Wednesdays first ODI as a busy season looms with home matches against Pakistan, Australia and England.
New Zealand: Kane Williamson (capt, first ODI only), Todd Astle, Trent Boult, Doug Bracewell, Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Tom Latham (capt, second and third ODIs), Adam Milne, Colin Munro, Henry Nicholls, Tim Southee (first ODI only), Ross Taylor, George Worker, Neil Broom (second and third ODIs), Mitchell Santner (second and third ODIs).

## Title: Wits in jangles with holiday jingles!

Wits in jangles with holiday jingles!
With Christmas just around the corner there is a nip in the air and continuous jingles jangling in my head. I notice that every year around this time, I hear Christmas music. It follows me everywhere this overused melodic nemesis piped in the malls and lifts and waiting rooms.
My ears have been assailed and are echoing with the Christmas tunes that are becoming exasperating with their bankrupt repertoire. I am sure you would agree with me wholesale, and retail that I am fed up with hearing Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells rock! Jingle bells. . . BANG! That was the festive sound of the radio being struck with a hammer by me! So you see an overdose of the holiday music has me already in a holi-daze!
God rest ye merry gentle people, let nothing you dismay, except excessive festive music, heard well in advance of Christmas Day. Yep, its that time again! That magical time of year when it is impossible to leave your house without a faint fa-a-la- la-la ringing in your ears. Tis the season of Christmas songs. Tis the season when you are reminded every single day. Tis the season when you can recite every single word of, Its the Most Wonderful Time of the Year because youve heard it 27,876 times this morning already and, let me tell you, there is nothing remotely wonderful about the kids jingle- belling and everyone telling you to be of good cheer.
Its extremely annoying. In fact, its more than just annoying. I hate to bring you tidings of discomfort, not joy, but some Christmas music is emotionally damaging and a hazard to your health. And if you've ever worked in a shop during November and December, chances are you will have found Christmas music incredibly infuriating.
I must also admit that I am not a big fan of The Little Drummer Boy. I am certain you are with me on that. Oh, sure, The Little Drummer Boy is a beautiful song, for maybe the first 35 minutes. But eventually it gets on your nerves, those voices shrieking Rum-pa-pa-pum!
For openers, drums do not go Rum-pa-pa-pum. Drums go Rat-a-tat-tat. Also, I have issues with the line from The Little Drummer Boy that goes: The ox and lamb kept time. Really How Did they clack their hooves together, castanet-style Did they dance Are we supposed to believe that two barnyard animals with legume-level IQs spontaneously started doing the macarena If they did they must have been unique laughing stock, cattle and sheep with a sense of humour and a year for music.
I'll tell you this: If I were taking care of a newborn baby, and somebody came around whacking on a drum, that person would find himself in the emergency room having his drumsticks surgically removed from his rum-pa-pa-pum, if you know what I mean. Take it from me theres no drummer boy mentioned anywhere in the gospels. Besides, Baruppapumpum is not a word in English or in Sinhala or Tamil, though it does sound a bit like the sound an automatic weapon makes while firing on all cylinders.
People can be so unfair at times even during the season of good cheer. The cops especially have no sense of fair play or humour either. If youre singing Christmas songs on your neighbours lawn at night with your church group, its called carol singing. But if youre doing it alone on the street wearing a Santa outfit its called drunk and disorderly behaviour. Or say, if you are doing it with no outfit at all, you will be charged with indecent exposure.
For a nation that sometimes finds it difficult to bare its soul, some Sri Lankan seasonal party drunks are surprisingly relaxed when it comes to baring their bodies. Many of them in a sober state are incredibly well dressed before divesting themselves of their clothes to begin their frivolities. In mitigation I must say in their defence that they all wore clothes suited to an activity far smarter than the one in which they were engaged in before being copped. There were men who had worn only neckties for the occasion, which they claimed had provided adequate cover to any dangling adjuncts far more effectively than old Adams fig leaf. But the cops are usually unmoved and refuse to buy excuses of exhibitionists prone to proper underwear amnesia.
Nobody announces in advance that they plan to end up buck naked in public. But it is amazing how often somebody does, plunging themselves into a world of almost unchecked social high-jinks. And the cops have the temerity to say that Santas nuts. That he is displaying naked aggression. That hes hallucinating. They call it the Insanity Clause. So they frog-march you to the cop-shop while you switch to a rousing baila with the popular local hit Ralahamy Mung polisiyay, Ralahamy Mung.
Ok, I will admit that the cops throw a blanket or a rain-cape around you when you are nabbed in an unclothed state in public. But they dont actually do so through compassion or to keep you warm from the cold snap either. I suspect they do it because they dont want to suffer an inferiority complex for the rest of the season.
A former journalistic colleague named Lou Hart and I once checked into adjoining hotel rooms one Christmas Eve while on an assignment in Singapore. I was just about to shower when I heard a huge commotion in the corridor outside. Opening the door I was assailed by the sight of Lou bawling his head off at an army of hotel staff. He was tipsy and looked a sight with a hotel towel, which was much too small for him, draped around his waist.
He was blubbering incoherently that his shower head attachment was defective.
Guests disturbed by his stentorian roar and peeping into the corridor only heard this part of his complaint: My damned attachment is loose and is moving around free willy! Lou was actually mixing free-wheeling and willy-nilly both literally and metaphorically.
And there was old Aunt Madeleine who at a family Christmas reunion had had one too many. She advanced towards the podium tottering perilously on insecure stiletto heels, much like a stilt-walker.
Then just as the toastmaster finished his celebratory ritual, Aunt Madeleine raised her glass leaned towards the microphone and made her own salutation: Up yours! After a few moments of stunned silence, the toastmaster explained that she had actually been going for was Bottoms up!
