Half-baked romance
Beautiful locations that take your breath away, impossibly gorgeous people, humungous homes, evergreen songs and catchy dances, the twist in tales which leave you begging for more and tear jerking endings This is what globally renowned director Karan Johar is best known for. So there is no doubt that fans who vie for the beautiful side of cinema and life have expected pretty much the same magic that he had performed with his previous movies when they visited cinemas to watch his latest cinematic project.
However Johars 2016 venture Ae Dil Hai Mushkil is a far cry from the likes of Kuch Kuch Hotha Hai, Kabhi Kuhi Kabhi Gahm, Ka Ho Na Ho, My Name is Khan and Student of the Year. Though it encompasses most of the ingredients which makes it a Karan Johar film, what lets it down badly is its plot. There is too much of emphasis on Ayans obsession with Alizeh and too many scenes which remind us of previous Karan Johar films.
Committed relationship
The plot revolves around four characters Ayan is blue blood rich but his ambition is to become a singer. The fiery Alizeh seems to be the bold and easy going character but her venerable side is her love for Ali. Saba is happily single after divorce. However she is looking for love though she does not want a committed relationship.
Ayan and Alizeh strike up a friendship after meeting at a bar. They are both similar in character with common tastes. However as time passes Ayan realizes that he wants more from the relationship. When both have broken up from the relationship they decide to spend a luxurious few weeks in Paris. There Alizeh unexpectedly comes upon her long lost love.
As usual the heightened emotions and the messy love-you-hate-you and cant-live-without moments are at the center of the tale. This is Johars strength as well as weakness. Such scenes are nothing new in his movies so much so that one always gets a feeling of dj vu when one sees such a scene. On the other hand this is what makes the creation one of the most felt works in Bollywod cinema. He is one of the few Indian filmmakers who manage to jerk out a tear from even the coldest hearts.
Glamour is also one of the features connected with Johars work but as characters are taken over by their emotions and suffer from their losses, the glitter is kept at bay. This adds some realism to the tale.
Well-rounded character
The star of the movie is probably Anushka Sharma who plays the well-rounded character of Alizeh. She is quite remarkable in this production and shares good chemistry with her co star. One cannot help feeling that Ranbir Kapoor cold have dished out a better performance as Ayan. Aishwarya has nothing to do but look beautiful in the story. She shouldnt have taken up a character with so little depth in the first place.
There comes a day when one wonders if Johar is bankrupt in fresh ideas. Ae Dil Hai Mushkil is one such movie which could have been made differently but gives the same old to its audience.

Jackson announces first post-Hobbit project
Things have been quiet for Peter Jackson after finally completing work on The Hobbit trilogy, which unfortunately faced a hurried journey to screen and a lukewarm reception from both fans and critics.
Jackson, however, has decided once more to return to the world of fantasy; The Hollywood Reporter states he will write and produce an adaptation of Philip Reeves Mortal Engines series of books, a quartet which focuses on a steampunk vision of London, now a monstrously huge machine which rolls across the landscape in search of the planets dwindling resources.
The director will work once more with Fran Walsh, his wife as well as co-writer and co-producer on the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films, alongside frequent collaborator Philippa Boyens; production is slated to start in spring in New Zealand, though Jackson and Walsh have been quietly working on the adaptation since 2009, when he opted the rights to the books from Scholastic.
He wont be taking the directors chair, though; handing over the reins to Christian Rivers, another New Zealand talent who has storyboarded all of Jacksons films since Braindead. After working as Second Unit Director on Petes Dragon, Rivers has also long been attached to Jacksons other project, a remake of 1955 British war film The Dam Busters.
Rivers also worked as Visual Effects Supervisor on The Lord of the Rings trilogy, even winning an Oscar for his work on 2005s King Kong, which Jackson also directed.

Trump had acted in a film produced by Rutnam
US President-elect, Donald Trump, had acted in a Hollywood film co-produced by the veteran Sri Lankan film-maker Chandran Rutnam with actress Bo Derek.
It was the 1989 film Ghosts Cant Do It directed by John Derek. It had in the lead, Bo Derek and Anthony Quinn. The film was shot in Galle in South Sri Lanka, Thoddu in the Maldives, and the states of Wyoming and New York in the US.
John Derek, the Director wrote a scene especially for Donald Trump to play himself in a cameo role. We shot the scene in the Board Room of the Trump Tower. It was a one day shoot and a delightful experience, Chandran said.
But the negative got scratched and we had to do it again. Trump happily agreed Chandran recalled.
In Ghosts Cant Do It Scott and Kate are happily married despite their 30-year age difference. After Scott suffers a heart attack and is unable to make love, he commits suicide and becomes a ghost that only Kate can see and speak with. To make it possible for Scott to return as a human, they conjure up a plan to have a young man drown so that Scott can take his body.
Bo Derek appeared as Katie Scott, Antony Quinn as Scott, Julie Newmar as Angel, and Donald Trump as himself. Sri Lankas versatile actor, Henry Jayasena, also appeared in the film.
Despite the star cast and excellent production values, Ghosts Cant do It bombed at the box office. It won the Stinkers Bad Movie Award, and Bo Derek the Worst Actress prize. Donald Trump was declared the Worst Supporting Actor at the Golden Raspberry Awards.
Chandran has sent a congratulatory message to Trump on winning the US Presidential election and invited him to Sri Lanka.

Sinha and Abraham pay tribute to jawans at India Gate
Ever since the first look of the upcoming film Force 2 was released, the makers have been promoting it as a film that pays respect to those who give away their lives on the borders to save ours. Even the trailer has a slide that salutes the armed forces.
And now, as the film is on its way to get released at the theatres, the team has pulled up their socks to promote it as much as possible but have chosen a different way. Unlike other films, the leads of the film, John Abraham and Sonakshi Sinha, have flown to Delhi to pay tribute to the armed forces.
Both the actors tweeted a picture of themselves in which they can be seen wearing an Indian army attire with Force 2 written on their backs. Well, seems like the makers know how to grab headlines and excite the audience about their film, without uttering a word. While we already know John as an action hero, Sonakshi will pack some punches and throw some kicks in the film. After Akira, this is her consecutive second film where we can see her in such a dangerous yet impressive avatar.

Force 2, the Hindi film with English subtitles will begin screening atMajestic Cineplex, Empire Arcade, Lido - Borella, andCity Cinema - Mt. Lavinia( at 4.15 pm) from November 18. It is a CEL release

Blunt is happy to recycle old outfits
Emily Blunt nearly ran out of clothes to wear during her second pregnancy. The British actress and her husband, The Office star John Krasinski, welcomed baby girl Violet in June (16), a sister to two-year-old Hazel.
Prior to Violets arrival, Emily was snapped at a farmers market wearing a pair of bright purple trousers  a unique ensemble which caught the attention of waiting photographers.
I was wearing these bright purple harem pants that were stretchy, Emily recalled to Britains Vogue magazine. And my friend, who likes to inform me on these things, sent me the links to the article which said, Emily Blunt, slumming it, wearing the same pair of purple sweatpants two days in a row. She must be running out of things to wear. Belfast Telegraph

Lopez teams up with Anthony again
Jennifer Lopez is working on a new album and shes teaming up with her ex-husband Marc Anthony to bring it to market. The singer, actress and entrepreneur has picked a project that celebrates her roots, recording all the songs of her next production in Spanish.
The former couple previously collaborated on her hit album Como Ama Una Mujer, which debuted at No. 10 on the U.S. Billboard 200 all-genre chart in 2007, proving language is no barrier to cross-market appeal.
Anthonys entertainment company, Magnus Media, and Sony Music Latin will develop, produce and release the yet unnamed album, which will be Lopezs first all-Spanish album in a decade.
I am so excited and really looking forward to this new musical journey and to celebrate my Latin roots with Marc Anthony and the Sony/Magnus family, Lopez said in a statement.
Although its been almost a decade since she released a Spanish-language album, in recent years she has teamed up with other Latino artists, including Pitbull, Ricky Martin and Wisin y Yandel to record hit singles in English and Spanish such as On the Floor, Follow the Leader, and Adrenalina. Earlier this year, she also collaborated with Lin-Manuel Miranda to record Love Make the World Go Round. The song was released as a digital charity single as a tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.
Given her superstar status and popularity, J-Lo can pick projects based on what piques her interest.
Shes one of the few people who can chose. How cool is that She can say I know that I want to do this and know people will buy it, says industry veteran Peggy Dold, who worked in the Latin music industry for 17 years and is now the CEO of entertainment consulting firm Navigation Partners LLC.
I dont think theres a risk here, Dold says about Lopez launching a new album in Spanish.
She has proven shes willing to go out on a limb. She works really hard. Shes got a great profile: shes a great dancer, executive, and actor. But shes also a bicultural American who has always represented her people and the new album will probably resonate with a large audience. My prediction is that Jennifer will deliver a fabulous record.

Bollywood is soaking in the Sufi spirit
It is music that touches you beautifully and differently  you find the sounds, the melody, and the lyrics, synonymous to words like roohaniyat, sukoon, divinity and spirituality. That, in laymans terms, is Sufi music. And no, you dont need to be someone who ardently follows religion to
understand the sheer power and divinity of this genre. The emotional accessibility, purity and mysticism that Sufi music exudes, is what has led to its wide popularity.
When you listen to songs like Bulleya (Ae Dil Hai Mushkil), Kun Faya Kun (Rockstar), Kabira (Yeh Jawaani Hai Diwaani), Arziyan (Delhi 6), Khwaja Mere Khwaja (Jodhaa Akbar), Mere Maula (Khakhee), Piya Haji Ali (Fiza), Ya Rabba (Salaam-E-Ishq), Saaiyaan (Heroine), Murshid Khele Holi (D-Day) and Tu Jaane Na (Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani), you realise that there is a distinctive magical melody in Sufi poetry.
Sufi and Bollywood go back decades
In the last few years, Sufi songs have seen a meteoric rise in the popularity charts and remain a steady feature on the playlists of youngsters. But then, Sufi music is not really new in films. Interestingly, it has been a part of the Hindi film industry since decades. Singer Mohit Chauhan says, Earlier, there were a lot of Sufi expressions in films and they used to come out in forms of qawwali. Every movie used to have a great qawwali in those days. Singer Rekha Bhardwaj adds, Back then, qawwali was the preferred form. But jaise jaise people became more aware of Rumi and Hafiz, somewhere, this new form emerged. Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan sahab was a huge reason why this genre came to the forefront so well.
Sufi rock, pop, trance and EDM have gained popularity
Sufi music has seen a lot of changes and this genre has embraced many kinds of music. Popular Sufi exponents say that the beauty of this genre lies in its ability to embrace all kinds of music. Over the years, with instruments and experimentations, it has blended with qawwali, majazi, haqiqi, trance music, rock, pop and EDM.
Singer Kavita Seth says, I believe that Irshaad Kamils Tum Hi Ho Bandhu from Cocktail, despite its pop-rock genre, has a Sufi feel. When I began the song Yaara Tere Sadke..., I was reading out Sufi poetry. The song in Neerja, Jeete Hain Chal, also has a Sufi connect. It is a motivational song.
Mohit adds, With time, the sound has changed, the style of expression has changed and now, we have a whole lot of different kinds of Sufi stuff in films  there are ones that are fused with Western elements, like there is Sufi rock. Naadan Parinde from Rockstar, sung by AR Rahman, is a good example of this genre.
Even an item song can have a Sufi connect
This kind of music has a vast reach, and it cannot be bound to any particular genre like romantic Sufi, soft Sufi, Rock Sufi, etc... Rekha explains this when she says, Even when I am singing an item song, it can have a Sufi element to it and I can connect with the divine.
Just adding words like Ya Ali, YaMaula is not Sufi (SUB HEAD)
The sheer popularity of this genre has also led to it being adapted into many kinds of Bollywood songs. Rekha says, Abhi toh fashion ho gaya hai kisi bhi cheez mein people just add Sufi  some do it without knowing much about the philosophy. They add words like YaAli, Ya Maula and Allah, and think that it is Sufi music. They dont know about the depth and thought behind it.
The sheer variety that Sufi offers is what is leading to its acceptance across generations. Kavita says, Kabirs dohas (15th-century Indian mystic poet and saint), and Meeras bhajans (16th-century Hindu mystic poet and devotee of Lord Krishna) can be sung in Sufi style.

Gritty Djokovic avoids Thiem upset at Tour Finals
LONDON, Sunday - Novak Djokovic survived a scare at the start of his bid to regain the world number one ranking as the Serb battled back for a 6-7 (10/12), 6-0, 6-2 victory over Austrias Dominic Thiem at the ATP Tour Finals on Sunday.
Djokovics 122-week reign at the top was ended by Andy Murray last weekend.
However, he can climb back into pole position by the end of the tournament if he lifts the Tour Finals title for a fifth successive year while winning at least two of his group stage matches.
The 29-year-old remains on track to achieve that target despite a shaky first set in the opening match of the prestigious season-ending tournament at Londons O2 Arena.
And amid all the questions about Djokovics decline, he can still clinch the season-ending number one spot for a third consecutive year and equal Roger Federers record of six Tour Finals titles by the end of next week.
Dominic started very well and we played on a very high level from the first point, Djokovic said.
He had a very high serve percentage and was the tougher player in the key moments of the tie-break.
I definitely did not want to let him get off to a good start in the second set.
Wimbledon finalist Milos Raonic beat flamboyant Frenchman Gael Monfils 6-3, 6-4 in the other match in Djokovics group on Sunday.
Djokovic established himself in the pantheon of all-time greats in June when his French Open triumph made him only the fifth man in the Open era to complete a clean sweep of the four Grand Slam tournaments. AFP

Sri Lanka hand Zimbabwe ODI thrashing
Harare: A change of format could not bring a change in fortunes for Zimbabwe, as Sri Lanka thrashed them by eight wickets in the first match of a one-day international triangular series at Harare Sports Club on Monday.
Four days after Sri Lanka sealed a 2-0 Test series sweep, the tourists bowled Zimbabwe out for 154 before chasing their target inside 25 overs to claim a bonus-point victory.
As with the Test matches, Zimbabwe suffered from the fragility of their top order, falling to 14 for three in the first five overs.
However, this time around they could at least point to some challenging conditions - Harare experienced heavy rain over the weekend, and cloudy skies on Monday morning gave Sri Lankas seamers plenty to work with.
In losing the toss we knew it was going to be tough, but there were too many soft wickets, said Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer. This was not a 150 type of wicket.
The collapse began in just the fourth over, when Suranga Lakmal had both Brian Chari and Craig Ervine caught at second slip in the space of three deliveries, and in the next over Sikandar Raza Butts careless legside flick off Nuwan Kulasekara found midwicket.
Sean Williams was then bamboozled by Sachith Pathiranas left-arm spin and was stumped by Niroshen Dickwella, before Nuwan Pradeep dismissed Chamu Chibhabha and Elton Chigumbura in successive overs to leave Zimbabwe 50 for six in the 18th over.
As in the Test series, it was left to Zimbabwes lower order to repair the damage.
Wicketkeeper-batsman Peter Moor struck a polished 47 and added 55 for the seventh wicket with Graeme Cremer, and once Moor was trapped lbw by Nuwan Kulasekara, Cremer marshalled the tail to good effect. The Zimbabwe captain put on 31 for the eighth wicket with Donald Tiripano, who made 19, and was left stranded on 31 not out when No. 11 Tinashe Panyangara attempted one big shot too many.Panyangara sliced a delivery off Asela Gunaratne to cover to give the allrounder figures of 3 for 21 in 6.3 overs, while Kulasekara, Lakmal and Pradeep finished with two wickets apiece as Zimbabwe were bowled out in 41.3 overs.
Everyone did really well, said Sri Lanka captain Upul Tharanga. The bowlers stuck to the plan and bowled in the right areas. They knew the wicket would do something.
With Dhananjaya de Silva and Kusal Perera putting on 56 for the first wicket, the result was never in doubt.
Although Perera was well caught at deep square leg by Sikandar Raza for 21 and Niroshan Dickwella fell for 41 with the target in sight, De Silva finished unbeaten on 78 as Sri Lanka romped home in 24.3 overs.
The triangular series also includes the West Indies, who will take on Sri Lanka at the same venue on Wednesday. AFP

Luck deserts Warner as Proteas maintain grip
HOBART Sunday: Luck deserted Australia in their desperate bid to salvage the second Test with South Africa snaring the vital wicket of David Warner in unfortunate circumstances in Hobart on Monday.
Warner, who was seeking redemption after his reckless dismissal in the opening over of the first innings, lost his wicket while at the forefront of Australias fightback.
At stumps on the third day the home side were hanging in at 121 for two, still 120 runs behind the Proteas, who have been in control of the Test since routing Australia for 85 on Saturday.
Usman Khawaja was unbeaten on 56, his ninth Test half-century, with skipper Steve Smith not out 18.
Warner flung his head back in despair when a ball from Kyle Abbott hit his hip and ricocheted off an elbow onto his stumps when he was on 45.
It gave the Proteas a huge fillip after Warner and Khawaja had recovered the innings with a 79-run stand after the loss of Joe Burns in the first over.
Burns lasted just four balls before he was caught behind, tickling at one wide down the leg-side from Abbott.
Lightning had struck twice for Australia with fellow opener Warner out to an expansive shot in the opening over in the first innings of the Test.
Khawaja played some lovely shots in his vigil, providing great support for his captain Smith, who top scored with an unbeaten 48 in the first innings shambles.
Australia face a mighty struggle to prevent South Africa, already 1-0 up, from claiming their third successive series in Australia with only next weeks day-night third Test in Adelaide still to play. South Africa earlier extended their first innings lead to 241 before they were all out for 326 with Quinton de Kock plundering a century and Josh Hazlewood finishing with six for 89.
Hazlewood captured three of the last four wickets to fall after lunch for his second best haul after his six for 70 against New Zealand in Adelaide last year to take his tally to 88 Test wickets.
Shortly after lunch, Tembo Bavuma was surprised by a rearing delivery to spoon an easy catch to Nathan Lyon at point and give Joe Mennie his first Test wicket for 74.
Keshav Maharaj followed shortly after, bowled by Hazlewood for one and Abbott lasted nine balls before he became the speedsters fifth dismissal for three.
Vernon Philander was the last man out for 32 off 28 balls, caught behind off Hazlewood.
After Sundays second day was washed out, the Australians chased early wickets but de Kock and Bavuma batted South Africa into a position of strength with a century stand.
The swashbuckling wicketkeeper was bowled by Hazlewood just before lunch for 104 off 143 balls with 17 boundaries.
His stand of 144 with Bavuma was the highest by a visiting team in Hobart for the sixth wicket. De Kock became only the fourth South African to register 50 or more in five consecutive Tests after he swept spinner Nathan Lyon for four over wide mid-on.
He has proven a thorn for Australia in this series following scores of 84 and 64 in the first Test victory in Perth. AFP
