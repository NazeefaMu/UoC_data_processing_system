Visual feast of diversity
The man is too frail, but he would not still give in. His cinema house does not attract crowds anymore. For they have moved beyond the scratch, watermark, film rolls and the shaky project. The crowds moved on to the newest phase of cinema, digitisation, about a decade back. And the old film exhibitor and his family are left with no option.
That sad story comes from India as Cinemawala as directed by Kaushik Ganguly.
Sri Lanka has not yet accomplished cinema digitisation in full form. The country nevertheless upholds its cinema culture. The newest in its cinema agenda is SAARC Film Festival to be held from June 1 to 6 at the National Film Corporation premises. Gangulys Cinemawala, among others, will be screened on June 4.
SAARC Cultural Centre Director Wasanthe Kotuwella said that the motion picture is the advanced creative form of humanitys gradual growth.
In studying fellow humans, we cannot afford to forget anthropology. Anthropology is where we get the opportunity to study human behaviour and its evolution. The film and its gradual evolution is also helpful in understanding how we have evolved, Kotuwelle said.
He added that the SAARC Festival has been promoting the cream of the regions cinema creativity. The festival, held for the last five years, could promote each and every culture through different genres of art  film, in this case.
The festival celebrates the best of South Asian talent, from feature films to short films. Each of these creations portrays various cultural features of the respective region, SAARC Cultural Centre Deputy Director Soundarie David said.
The festival held in Colombo will provide a platform for cinema aficionados to interact with their foreign contemporaries. For any Sri Lankan student of culture  including anthropologists  this will be the opportunity to study how creativity works in neighbouring regions: India, Nepal, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Pakistan.
The festival has been successful in the past. And we hope to expand the festival with more workshops and parallel programmes, David added.
While David focused on the festival, Organising Committee Consultant Dhanushka Gunatilleke laid emphasis on the films being screened at the festival.
All the films screened at the festival have been nominated by the Cultural Department or Cultural Affairs Ministry of the respective country. Our own Ho Gana Pokuna and Bora Diya Pokuna were also nominated by Cultural Affairs ministry, Gunatilleke said.
The films are the window to observe the country that it represents. That said, the public can watch the cream of the South Asian regions creativity.
Awards will be given to the Best Feature and Short Film. That category will be judged by a panel of international jury: France, Russia and Korea. The jury members have earned reputation in cinema. Parallel events such as masterclasses, workshops and interactive sessions are organised in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Foundation - Digital Film Academy.
The best feature trophy, in 2015, was given to Sri Lanka for Motor Bicycle Directed by Shameera Rangana Naotunna.
Bangladesh bagged the Silver Medal for its Mrittika Maya by Gazi Rakayet and Insaana from the Maldives by Ali Seaxana received the bronze medal. The best short film of the 2015 festival was Nepals Love Lust Life by Utpal Jha.

Chan-Li combination on screen
Running along the familiar territory of a dozen martial arts movies in which the helpless victim turns underdog, Rob Minkoffs Jackie Chan and Jet Li starrer The Forbidden Kingdom is no exception. This martial arts epic comprises many time tested clichs yet provides an enjoyable watch for kung-fu fans.
The movie begins with the legend of the immortal Monkey King imprisoned in stone by the evil Jade War Lord. Many years later the Monkey Kings fighting staff comes into the possession of Jason Tripitikas, a nerdy kid in Boston who also happens to be a die hard kung-fu fan.
While being beaten up by bullies in the back alley Jason is transported back to ancient China where he is expected to return the staff to its rightful owner.
During his quest he meets martial arts expert Lu Yan and is aided by the vengeful Golden Sparrow, a mysterious monk who has his own allegiance to the Monkey King and an orphaned female warrior seeking revenge against the warlord for killing her parents.
Novel twist
Li Bing Bing as Ni Chin
Lu and the monk becomes Jasons kung-fu teachers and prepares him for battle as they journey to the warlords far away kingdom. Although he seems hopeless at the art at first glance, Jason gradually learns how to take command and even manages to scare away the bullies who had him under their thumb back at home. The team even has to battle with a white-haired witch named Ni Chin who is seeking a means of becoming immortal, before facing their final opponent, the evil Jade.
These kind of storyline has existed since cinema began and it seems a shame that the team could not come up with a novel twist to the tale. Not only is the ending predictable but so is the beginning and middle. Make a few alterations to some scenes and introduce new characters to the stereotyped martial arts movies and you will get a picture of what to expect even before you have watched the The Forbidden Kingdom.
Chan manages to earn a few laughs as the drunken martial arts teacher, Lu Yan. Despite his serious avatar Li too manages to dish out some memorable moments.
Sadly Michael Angarano, the protagonist of the movie, overacts and is too goofy to be taken seriously. Collin Chou makes an admirable Jade Warlord. Liu Yifei and Li Bing Bing should be commended for the parts that they play as Golden Sparrow and Ni Chin. One cannot help but wish that they should have been given more screen space.
Background scenes
Viewers will be able to recall instances from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Karate Kid.
Chans costume and behaviour even makes us recall Captain Jack Sparrow from the Pirates Of The Caribbean series. There are mystery ridden moments which resemble moments from Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings.
The background scenes are surprisingly good with lots of detail, colours and light control. Though the story drags on at some points these minor details keep us interested on what is happening on the screen.
The fight scenes too are carried out well with grace and energy. Yuen Woo-ping deserves kudos for his choreography because he inserts diverse moves into the scenes.
The maiden battle between Chan and Li is especially effective and creates the awestruck effect that the team vies for.
The films strength is the fact that it brings the much vied Chan-Li combination on screen. Their double acting roles are an added bonus. However these few facts are not sufficient to grade the movie a success for if not for the Hong Kong icons the movie would not have been worth a second glance.

Bungling good humour
Ceylon Theatres once again reminds its movie-goers and re-iterates its commitment to bringing movies of a different caliber to the wide screen, thus providing variety in entertainment.
Ryan Gosling plays Holland March, a private investigator and Russel Crowe is Jackson Healy, a hired gun with no patience for Marchs fooling around. Directed by Shane Black who made his fortune two decades ago churning out hardcore action scripts for Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout and The Long Kiss Goodnight.
The two stars are the main attraction and they mix it up with bungling good humour. The footloose and fancy-free attitude looks good on Gosling and together with Crowe of Gladiator fame, who relaxes into his role with the pleasurable nonchalance of an acting giant on a holiday. The plot keeps rearing its incoherent head in the form of Amelias mother. Shes Judith Kuttner, the chief of the California Department of Justice, and shes played with an arsenal of hidden agendas by Kim Basinger who memorably teamed up with Crowe in 1997s L.A.
Confidential, the modern gold standard in film noir. Basinger won an Oscar for that film. Settle in and get ready for some random lunacy dished out by experts, dig right in.
More suitable for Adults, The Nice Guys is screened at Majestic Cineplex at 10.45 / 1.45 / 4.45 /7.30 Fri/Sat 10.30 pm and at Empire Cineplex - Independence Arcade Square at 10.30 / 1.30 /4.30 7.30 Fri/Sat 10.30 pm

A Salman Khan-Deepika Padukone pairing 
Raj Kumar Santoshi, who directed Salman Khan in the 90s hit Andaz Apna Apna, is teaming up with the superstar once again.
After their hit collaboration 22 years ago, the two had worked together in Santoshis Ajab Prem Ki Gazab Kahani, however the film only featured Salman in a cameo. Now, we hear that Santoshis next film features the actor in the lead role and work on it has already begun. Salman is busy with Sultan, but the director has met Salman many times already and has discussed details of the project.
While Salman has been finalised as the male lead, the films leading lady is yet to be shortlisted. We hear that Santoshi has already sounded off Deepika Padukones team about the project. The actress is currently away, shooting for her big Hollywood debut with Vin Diesel. Meanwhile, her team has been scanning a lot of movie offers and keeping them ready for her to go through once shes back.
A source tells us, There is a lot of speculation surrounding the films leading lady. Ultimately, it will be Salmans call on wholl be the heroine. Santoshi has already suggested Deepika as his choice and she has been approached. Efforts are being made to get the pair on screen together.
There have been several instances in the past where makers have tried to bring Salman and Deepika together on screen, but nothing has materialised till now. As for Deepika, she is most likely to team up with Ranveer once again for Bhansalis next. Apart from Bhansali, Deepika is also considering a script from another director.
The source added, Deepika is definitely keen on this project. Raj Kumar Santoshi is one of the most successful directors in the industry and has a great track record. His movies appeal to the audience and this pairing will definitely make this project one of the most anticipated projects of next year.

Colourless love
Communal harmony is a subject that had been repeatedly discussed and preached over many decades in this country. Yet the progress towards the object is very low.
The 30 year separatist war greatly tarnished harmony within Sinhala and Tamil communities. Religions, castes and various dogmas too are exploited by parties with sinister motives to create more division between communities adding insult to injury.
Our country is now on a revival phase. Thus it is of vital importance that significance of communal harmony and harmony within people are communicated effectively to masses at this juncture.
Cinema is a very effective tool that can be used in this communication drive. In the recent past we saw quite a few films made to serve this purpose. Adara Kathawak (A Love Story) made by Chandran Rutnam decades back still linger in the minds of local filmgoers. However the film ends with a negative note.
The seasoned film director V Sivadasan has now joined the bandwagon to make a film on communal harmony. Keerthi Ruwan Lalson is the co-director of the film.
Muhurath ceremony of the film; Paatak Nethi Adarayak (A Colourless Love) was held recently and shooting is now in progress.
The story revolves around two youngsters of different communities and different religious backgrounds falling in love amidst heavy resistance from their parents. Paatak Nethi Adarayak according to its screenplay will progress towards a happy ending unlike Rutnams film. Thus it is for the families to watch and enjoy.
The cast comprises; Sathischandra Edirisinghe, Jayalath Manoratne, Dilhani Ashokamala, Meena Kumari, Buddhika Kalindu, Poshini Nadee Kumari, Wasanthi Ranwala, Chanaka Madushan and Yohan Perera.
Camera is handled by Sujith Nishantha and the film is edited by Buddhika Ranasinghe. Renowned musician Somapala Ratnayake has done the music scores. Sunil Dharmasiri is the lyricist. Sanjeewani Weerasinghe, Poorna Sachintha, Manisha Chanchala and Sathish Lakshan have contributed as playback singers.
Paatak Nethi Adarayak is Sivadasans tenth film direction. The film is produced by S Thumilan of Blue Ocean Entertainment fame.

Hyderabad beat Bangalore for maiden IPL win
BANGALORE, SUNDAY: Skipper David Warners sparkling half century helped Sunrisers Hyderabad survive a punishing blitz by Chris Gayle to edge out Royal Challengers Bangalore by eight runs in the Indian Premier League final on Sunday.
Defending 208 to claim their maiden IPL title, Hyderabad restricted Virat Kohlis Bangalore to 200 for seven at the M Chinnaswamy stadium with Gayles 38-ball 76 in vain.

With 18 runs required off the final over, pace spearhead Bhuvneshwar Kumar -- the leading wicket taker of the season with 23 scalps -- gave away just nine as the Hyderabad players celebrated amid fireworks.
Electing to bat first, Hyderabad rode on entertaining knocks from Australias Warner and Ben Cutting to post a mammoth 208 for seven in 20 overs.
Fantastic team achievement. To lead this side and the support from the players, me pulling my weight with the runs, it has been a hard journey. Its a team effort, a delighted Warner said after the triumph.
If Warner laid a solid foundation with his ninth fifty of this IPL season then fellow Aussie Cutting finished it off with an unbeaten 39 off 15 deliveries.
Left-handed Warner (69), who accumulated 848 runs in 17 matches, gave the team a rollicking 63-run start with opener Shikhar Dhawan (28).
Warner smashed the ball to all parts of the ground and took a special liking to Shane Watson whose opening over -- the fifth of the innings -- cost 18 runs.
Leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, who remained the teams top wicket taker of the season with 21, got the first breakthrough in Dhawan who mistimed a slog sweep to deep square leg.
Warner, whose 38-ball knock was laced with eight fours and three sixes, kept up the run rate, forcing Kohli to juggle with his bowling options.
England medium-pacer Chris Jordan (3-45) replaced left-arm spinner Iqbal Abdullah in the 10th over to send Australias Moises Henriques trudging back to the dug out.
Aravind got the prized scalp of Warner, who threw away his wicket while trying to slash at a widish delivery and got caught at short third man.
Veteran India batsman Yuvraj Singh took over from where Warner left off, smacking 38 runs from 23 balls to keep the momentum going.
The Bangalore bowlers kept coming back to get wickets in between but could never arrest the flow of runs.

Isipathana thrashes Wesley 43-8
Gallant Isipathana College, Colombo rugby team dished out a superb brand of running rugby once again to beat Wesley College, Colombo in their Singer inter school A Division league rugby tournament second round match by 43 points ( 7 Tries, 4 Conversions) to 8 ( 1 Try, 1 Penalty) played yesterday at the Royal Sports Complex in Reid Avenue. The winners led 10-3 at half time.
The match got off to a rousing start with both teams battling it out for supremacy where Isipathana drew first blood in the 17th minute when their winger Chamod Fernando broke through the blind side after covering nearly 30 metres and gave a fabulous off load to full back Gayan wickramaratne who touched down mid left. Wickramaratne himself missed the conversion and Pathana went into a 5 nil lead.
In the 30th minute, Wesley scrum half Avishka Lee put over a 35 metre penalty to cut down the lead to 5-3.
Soon after in the 27th minute, Pathana three quarters collected a ball and set their line in motion where ball passed into several hands from winger Fernando on to full back Wickramaratne who sprinted his way through to score far right. He himself ones again missed the conversion and the score read Isipathana 10 to Wesley 3. This score stood at half time.

Cook looks ahead after breaking 10,000 barrier
Chester-le-Street, Monday: England captain Alastair Cook was already looking ahead after becoming the youngest batsman to score 10,000 Test runs during the course of his sides series-clinching win over Sri Lanka at the Riverside on Monday.
Cook, who started the day needing five more runs to bring up his 10,000, reached the landmark when he clipped Nuwan Pradeep for four through mid-wicket.
That left-handed opener finished on 47 not out as England won the second Test with more than a day to spare, a victory that put them 2-0 up in the three-match series.
Cook is the first England batsman to score 10,000 Test runs and at 31 years and 157 days old, the youngest from any country, beating the previous record of India great Sachin Tendulkar (31 years and 326 days).
Its a very special moment for me, but the game is not about personal milestones, its about winning games and scoring runs to do that, said Cook. AFP

England wins second Test and takes winning lead in series : Chandimal leads superb rearguard action with century
DURHAM: Dinesh Chandimal led a splendid rearguard action by Sri Lanka with his sixth Test century but could not prevent England from winning the second Test by nine wickets and taking a winning 2-0 lead in the three-match series on the fourth day at Chester-le-Street here Monday.
Chandimal who was unbeaten on 54 the previous day went onto score a brilliant 126 off 207 balls (13 fours, 1 six) to take Sri Lanka to an impressive second innings total of 475 after being forced to follow-on 397 runs in arrears. Sri Lanka were dismissed for 101 in their first innings in reply to Englands 498-9 declared.
England left with 79 runs to chase scored 80 for one wicket with Alastair Cook finally reaching that elusive 10,000 runs mark to become the first Englishman to cross the figure in Test cricket.
Cook needing five runs to reach the milestone was unbeaten on 47 and Nick Compton was 22 not out when England finally achieved victory 42 minutes after tea in brilliant sunshine that gave way to chilly, overcast skies and strong winds at the start of play that saw play take place under floodlights.
However the day belonged to Chandimal who played a terrific innings to keep the England bowlers at bay. In Rangana Herath he found an able ally and the pair stayed together for over two hours as they forged a seventh wicket partnership of 116 off 170 balls.
Herath played some wonderful sweep shots and reverse sweeps as he made a plucky half century (61 off 99 balls with 8 fours). He received a standing ovation from the crowd when he was dismissed lbw to Jimmy Anderson to give the England spearhead his 450th Test wicket. It was Herath second fifty in Test cricket and the third occasion he had been involved in a rearguard century partnership.
The previous two instances  115 for the eighth wicket with Lasith Malinga against India at Galle in 2010 and 149 with Angelo Mathews also for the eighth wicket against England at Leeds in 2014 both resulted in Sri Lanka winning. But unfortunately it was not to be the case here.
Sri Lanka starting the day at 309-5 lost Milinda Siriwardana as early as the fifth over of the day for 35 without adding to his overnight score. His dismissal by Anderson ended a 92-run stand for the sixth wicket with Chandimal.
Englands lack of a quality spinner in the side was exposed on this slow pitch which afforded turn when their seamers failed separate Chandimal and Herath for the next two hours or so.
Moeen Ali, more or less a part time spinner was hit for 136 runs for his solitary wicket.
Following Heraths dismissal, Anderson picked up his 21st five-for in an innings when he bowled Shaminda Eranga for one.
Chandimals marvelous innings coming to an end in the first hour after lunch when he went for a big heave against Stuart Broad and had his off stump clipped. It was his sixth Test hundred, first against England and the first outside Asia.
Spurred by the heroics of Herath and Chandimal, the Lankan tail wagged with Suranga Lakmal (11) and Nuwan Pradeep (13 n.o.) adding a further 22 for the last wicket before Woakes ended it by having Lakmal caught by Broad at mid-on.
On the face of the stern resistance put up by the Lankan batsmen for the first time in the series Englands fielding began to falter as they missed both Chandimal and Herath to easy catches.
Wicket-keeper Jonny Bairstow failed to hold onto an inside edge off Chandimal when he was 69 and Herath at 46 was dropped by James Vince at backward point  in both instances Anderson was the bowler.
With the partnership growing into threaten proportions England had to depend on their most experienced bowler for the breakthrough and did not fail them.
Anderson ended with figures of five 58 and with eight wickets in the match he is easily the leading bowler in the series with 18 wickets.
Sri Lanka lost 33 wickets in the series without a single 50-run partnership but they produced three for the last seven wickets. Sri Lanka took 128.2 overs for their entire second innings which was nearly 13 overs more than they had batted in their first three innings of the series.
Sri Lankas fabulous batting performance would certainly brought a great deal of confidence into the dressing room and made them all geared up for the third and final Test beginning in ten days from now at Lords.
Anderson was named Man of the Match.
