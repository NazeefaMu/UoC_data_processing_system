Victoria Golf and Country Resort: Luxurious relaxation
The Victoria Golf and Country Resort is beautiful, luxurious and elegant resort located in the picturesque environs of Rajawella. The Golf course has been ranked among the 100 Most Beautiful Golf Courses in the World and is the proud winner of the award for The Best Golf Course in the Subcontinent.
However not many people are aware that The Victoria Golf and Country Resort is a resort of a very high standard offering comfort and to quality service. Daily News visited the resort and experienced first- hand how wonderful it is to stay there. Personalized attention is a feature of the resort which exceeds expectation. It is ideal for relaxation away from the hustle and bustle of Colombo.
The rooms were tastefully designed and had all the creature comforts necessary to make the stay a most memorable one. The food the resort offers is sumptuous and the ambience was just perfect. All in all it was a blissful experience. The cuisine was of excellent quality ranging from traditional Sri Lankan to Western and Asian Cuisines.
The property is 517 acres of Land Area including the Golf Course which is a 120 acres 18 hole, finished in 73 strokes for a professional. It is a world class golf course.
The golf course is the vision of Mark Bostock, leader of Rajawella Holdings who had the dream of creating a world class golf course in Sri Lanka. For this he selected the UK National Golf Architect Donald Steel who drew up a plan for an 18-hole golf facility. This was in 1992. In 1997 the designing started.
And today we have a majestically crafted masterpiece full of breathtaking scenery. Here much attention was given to detail such as the locations for the greens, and the shaping was done with machines which produced excellent results. The opening was in 1999. In 1999, a hundred golfers gathered for the opening and played for the Donald Steel Trophy. However Bostocks vision was to turn this into a golf resort, where you have a golf course as well as a residence around, said Resorts General Manager, Asela Wavita.
Wavita pointed out that there is a Junior Academy where there are 40  45 kids at the moment. They are given a good foundation and sessions are fun. They just launched golf at Trinity College and they are looking to take it to other schools in Kandy to promote golf. There is also the dream of starting the school tournament in Kandy as well. The Victoria Golf Club is open to membership and the club has a great atmosphere.
When initially building the golf course, it was a lot of hard work since at that time, this was a high security zone. But after some time, and after getting through a lot of red tape, the project was finished and now we have a golf course that we can be proud of. And now every February we have the Donald Steel Championship, stated Wavita
As for the resort itself the target is to have around 50 rooms by early 2020. Some of the activities that the resort offers at present are nature treks which are ideal for wildlife enthusiasts and horse riding. He added that they are looking forward to add watersports as well. When it comes to weddings the resort is in demand and a wedding at this resort will definitely be memorable. The golf course is excellent for socializing and just having fun.

## Title: Why Do Dogs Eat Grass

Why Do Dogs Eat Grass
Why do dogs eat grass What does it mean Is it healthy Should you be worried How much is too much These are only a few of the questions that often concern many dog owners.
Even though you may be worried as a dog owner, the main thing to understand is eating grass is very common among dogs. Actually, dogs tend to eat and chew on a lot of things that do not classify as edible. It may be for playful reasons, especially among puppies.
There are several other explanations to this behavior. The following three explanations elaborate some of the most common reasons why dogs eat grass. This will allow you to have insight on whether you should let it be or take precautions.
Reason #1 
They want to find new entertaining activities
Dogs as creatures are very playful and energetic. They try to find alternative ways to fill up their time, and they will do it by interacting with their surroundings. This may include eating grass. You can always start to track how much exercise your dog is getting so that you can get an idea of what could be changed.
Reason #2 
Stomach issues
This is the most widespread belief and probably the one that worries you most. Nevertheless, before reaching any final conclusions, keep in mind that it might not even be that serious. As it was mentioned before, it is normal for dogs to vomit 1 to 2 times a year, just like for humans! It is believed that dogs turn to grass as a self-medication technique.
However, you must understand that grass-eating does not necessarily correlate with vomiting. Actually, it is quite rare! Only around a quarter of dogs vomit from the grass they eat. This means that in the majority of the cases, grass eating does not have any effect in the dogs digestive system. So do not expect that your dog will vomit automatically after eating grass.
If eventually vomiting happens and, you notice that it happens frequently, then the dog may have a more serious disease. Two of the most common ones could be gastric reflux or inflammatory bowel disease.
Gastric Reflux is a disease that can be potentially dangerous for your pet, if not treated in time. One of the causes may be unknown (usually inedible) objects that go into a dogs stomach.
Therefore, it is essential for you to monitor what your dog eats. If you suspect that this is what is happening, make sure to check out for symptoms like bad breath, burping, occasional vomiting or too much salivation.
Inflammatory bowel disease is another disease that causes discomfort to your dog. It is usually manifested with vomiting and diarrhea. This disease affects most organs and makes the dogs immunity weaker. Some of the most common causes are traveling and recent vaccination but, there may be other causes as well.
The symptoms you should look out for are loss of appetite, diarrhea and weight loss. If you notice that your dog is expressing similar behavior to the above-mentioned symptoms, you must consider taking action immediately.
Reason #3 
Nutritional needs
Sometimes your dog might turn to eating grass when it is lacking nutrients, especially fiber. If your dog is not showing symptoms of a disease as mentioned above, the issue might be the food it consumes. Another reason could be the taste of grass which for some dogs may be interesting and simply tasty.
Overall, grass-eating should not be a concern for you as an owner unless it is followed by other symptoms as well.

Women still reluctant to screen for breast cancer
Sri Lankan women are still reluctant to get themselves screened for breast cancer, Health Deputy Minister Faizal Kassim said.
"Women should get themselves screened at cancer screening clinics done free to lead a healthy life and to save their own lives from cancers," he said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Government Information Department yesterday he said still women are reluctant to visit Well Women clinics and Healthy Lifestyle Centers countrywide in state hospitals that offer free screening.
"Only around 20 women turned up for a recent free screening for breast cancer held in the Eastern Province. The total female population of the area is around 15,000,"Kassim said.
He said women are scared, ashamed or scared of social stigma (comes with a possible detection of cancer) and do not get themselves screened. They suffer from late stage breast cancers. But breast cancer can be cured if detected early through a mammogram.
The Indra Foundation of India will grant Rs.780 million to implement a five year project to offer mobile breast cancer screening facilities in remote villages.The project has already been approved. All women should make use of this free facility and become free of cancer, he added.

E-commerce, virtual store  concept threatening retail  real estate sector across  Asian countries
Emergence of e-commerce and virtual store concept is noticeably replacing physical stores, threatening the demand for retail real estate sector across many countries in Asia including Sri Lanka, said Nalin Herath, Managing Director of Home Lands Holdings and Survey Systems.
Structural trends such as demographic shifts and technology changes are expected to disrupt real estate fundamentals and impact strategies, Herath told Daily News Business.
Retirees leaving work force has lowered the demand for office space in many countries across the world. Furthermore, Millennials contribute to continuous urbanization, in which renting out option seems to surge above owned home option. This will be having a clear impact on demand for rented and owned property in multifamily and single family markets, he said.
Commenting on Real estate sector in Sri Lanka, he said sector will grow healthy in Lankan soil if only industry best practices, appealing yet equitable and transparent tax policies, consistency and corporate governance could be promoted within the countrys socio-economy.
According to him, during the last couple of years, demand for residential, commercial and industrial real estate have increased resulting prices to increase, yet in a reducing frequency, with residential land price inflation showing the sharpest slowdown.
Even though the land prices in the country have been increasing, according to researchers, the rate of year-on-year increase has slowed down during last three quarters, he said.
The residential land price inflation showed the sharpest slowdown, when compared to commercial and industrial land prices. It could be highlighted that the demand for condominiums in and around Colombo has grown within last couple of years resulting in increased price, he said that this can be considered to be much owing to the ongoing comprehensive transportation face lift including; Light Rail Transit (LRT), Outer Circular Expressway and Elevated Highway.
Furthermore, strong tourism flows has added demand to the leisure real estate, which is much prominent in Sri Lankan context. Also a trend can be seen that the giants in leisure and hospitality industry entering real estate.
He also noted that both real estate developers and customers are facing hindrance due to restricted lending and constrained asset to credit exposure.
We as developers are facing difficulties in financing our real estate projects. Anyway the impact on the customers is largely cushioned as most of them are financed by the payment schemes offered by the developer itself, he pointed out.
However due to limited opportunities in obtaining external financing for real estate business, the developers will have to have a second thought when offering in-house installments schemes to the customers, resulting the customers to seek external financing which has anyway been restricted.
This will indirectly affect the customers as well and the domestic real estate market operations will slow down at the end of the day, he added.
Currently Colombo can be called the most economically and technologically exalted city in the country and this has made the commercial capital and its suburbs much more appealing for both local and foreign investors. The rising demand for real estate property has obviously led to price hikes, he said.
Commenting on price scenario of houses and apartments in Colombo, he said the price of a mid-range house in Colombo and the closest suburbs amounts somewhat between Rs. 10-20 Mn, a mid-range apartment is priced between about Rs. 30-45 Mn. While price of a luxury house comes roughly between Rs. 50-60 Mn, a luxury apartment is around Rs. 70 Mn and above in the commercial capital.
Highlighting major challenges faced by the industry, he said restricted lending, imposition of Capital Gains Tax and withholding tax and lack of encouragement from the government and Central Bank have created a number of negative impacts on the real estate and construction industries.

A timely achievement
The proceedings of the Presidential Commission probing the goings-on at SriLankan and the now-defunct Mihin Lanka published in all the daily newspapers generally make for grim reading. Yes, SriLankan has already nosedived into massive losses and debts and the Government will again be looking at finding a strategic partner for the airline in a few months, after several previous attempts failed.
But once in a while comes a news item that pleasantly surprises you and restores faith in the idea that every country should have a national carrier. We pen these lines after learning that SriLankan Airlines has achieved the remarkable feat of being named the worlds most punctual airline for September 2018, in the key categories of Global Airlines and Major Airlines, by the flight data analysis company Flightstats.com.
An extraordinary 91.37% of SriLankan Airlines flights in September 2018 were on time, according to an analysis by Flightstats. SriLankans punctuality was far ahead of the giant US based carrier Delta Airlines, which was in second place with 86.74% flights on time, while third place went to the Japanese airline ANA with 86.61% on time.
This is indeed an exemplary and praiseworthy achievement by an airline once mocked as being Usually Late after its IATA moniker UL. This is also a rare achievement for a country known for Sri Lanka Time, an euphuism for being late at least by an hour. This is partly due to our laid-back, nonchalant attitude to the passage of time, but every second counts in the cut-throat airline business and it pays to take to the air on time. Even a slight delay can lead to a vicious cycle where connecting flights get affected, the aircrafts arrival and next departure get delayed and ultimately, the entire flight network gets affected. This is why it is vital for airlines to take off on time.
SriLankans exceptional performance came after the airline launched its dynamic new Ready to Fly programme at the beginning of September, to enhance its service by providing increased punctuality levels for its flights around the world. According to the airline, SriLankans consistently high level of on-time performance is the result of a structured process that monitors and co-ordinates the performance of all departments and individual staff members responsible for various aspects of its operations. The degree of attention given for punctuality monitoring is apparently infallibly high, with zero tolerance for slips in the process.
This performance is all the more creditable, given that a far greater proportion of delays are beyond the control of the airline. These are unforeseen events such as air traffic control related issues at congested airports, adverse weather, insufficient infrastructure at airports, industrial unrest at some airports, flight diversions due to medical emergencies, bird strikes on aircraft, and baggage issues. Moreover, all safety issues should also be attended to within these timeframes.
In addition to the punctuality recognition, SriLankan Airlines was recently honoured with a prestigious Four Star Rating in the Major Regional Airline category by the Airline Passenger Experience Association (APEX) for the second year running. The ratings are based on the feedback of passengers from around the world, who rate airlines on overall flight experience; seat comfort; cabin service; food and beverage; entertainment; and Wi-Fi. The airline has also been receiving many rave reviews recently. The passenger experience is exemplary in every way; Id be more than happy to fly with SriLankan again, wrote one reviewer for the prestigious Traveller magazine (Australia).
But the one factor that made this difference is also the most important  a professional management. The airline has been making many gains since a professional management team was appointed recently. In fact, during a recent interview with CNN, Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde GebreMariam said the one factor that made his airline the fastest growing and most profitable one in Africa was a professional management free of political interference, although the airline is 100 percent owned by the Government of Ethiopia. SriLankan has the potential to reach such heights if nurtured properly.
SriLankan has already made several changes to its winter schedule which we hope have been done after much research and thought. Some apparently loss-making routes such as Hong Kong and Vizag have been axed  this is a must for any airline as there is no point in flying to a destination with a non-viable load factor.
The airline should explore the possibility of returning to Continental Europe (Paris, Frankfurt, Rome etc.), one of our most important inbound tourism markets, probably after gaining a measure of financial stability (the airline continues to fly to London). Given the success of the new Melbourne flight, the airline should consider adding Sydney to its network separately or as an add-on. Other new Asian and non-Asian destinations must be contemplated and existing services must be boosted where possible and viable.
SriLankan is slowly but surely turning into an airline we can once again be proud of. There is a long way to go, but a good start has been made. The airline should fly high with the nations expectations on its wings.

Aloysius and Palisenas revision application dismissed
The Court of Appeal yesterday dismissed the revision application filed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena who sought an Interim Order to release them on bail.
Court of Appeal (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne decided to refuse the application in limine citing that two petitioners (suspects in magisterial inquiry) failed to provide any reasonable ground to invoke Court of Appeals revision jurisdiction. Accordingly, Court of Appeal refused to issue notices on respondents and dismissed the petition without cost. The Court of Appeal observed that it is premature to seek revision jurisdiction at this moment since the petitioners have not been indicted in courts by the Attorney General while the CID is beingconducting investigations into the matter.
The two suspects were remanded in connection with the Central Bank Bond issuance in 2015.

Aspire RCM offers young professionals  a pathway in healthcare
Aspire RCM, a US Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) training institute in Sri Lanka, offers young professionals and school leavers a pathway to pursue an exciting career in the fast-expanding US healthcare KPO industry in Sri Lanka.
Aspire RCM is also providing RCM companies the opportunity to streamline their operations in order to enhance their employee knowledge and skill levels in RCM through their advanced training.
The US healthcare industry is a US$ 3.2 trillion industry that is widely known to be stable and constantly expanding. These KPO companies are growing rapidly in Sri Lanka, creating a whole new line of work and providing employment opportunities for thousands of young Sri Lankans.
The number of Healthcare RCM companies in Sri Lanka has grown from three to eleven from 2012 to 2018 while the number of employees has grown from 375 to over 2,000 and therefore the potential for KPO business from the RCM industry is significant.
Aspire RCMs main objective is to offer young Sri Lankans the basic industry knowledge through a specialised training course that will help them step into this booming industry. In order to achieve this, Aspire RCM offers a foundation training course titled Basics in Medical Billing & RCM which is a 1-month course thatgears them up to enter the industry.
Aspire RCM also offers several advanced courses for RCM companies to further the knowledge of their employees in the industry. The Advanced Medical Billing and Advanced Medical Collections aretraining coursesfor Billing and Collections Executives who have served a minimum 6 months in their respective job roles.
They also offer the Corporate Management Training course which is a tailor-made training coursefor aspiring managers of RCM companies to enhancetheir team management knowledge via customized management training specific to their industry.Additionally, they provide Employee Assessment Consulting, a convenientsolution which RCM companies can utilize to obtain independent, third party reviews of their employees for the purpose of company promotions, performance evaluations and identifying training needs.
Expressing his views, Shabney Ismail - CEO of Aspire RCM stated, Entering the KPO industry can offer a young professional or a school leaver the chance to go up the career ladder and reach a greater position in life in a much shorter time than the traditionally popular careers of marketing, finance, ICT or management. The younger generation of Sri Lanka need to look at the newer opportunities coming into the country not just in US healthcare but in other industries as well.

Birdies in the air: Golf back in Pakistan after 11-year hitch
KARACHI, Thursday - Birds were released over fairways and ceremonial drives were struck as international golf returned to Pakistan Thursday after an 11-year absence.
A full field of 132 players from around the globe were teeing up in the Asian Tour's UMA CNS Open Championship at Karachi Golf Club, the latest thawing of relations with the militancy-hit country that has spent years in the sporting wilderness.
"Coming back to Pakistan is a fantastic opportunity for us," Robert Andrew, event director of the Asian Tour told AFP, brushing off any security concerns.
"This is the starting point for future years after the success of this event."
No major golf tour has visited Pakistan since 2007. The last scheduled tournament, in 2008, was cancelled after a wave of insurgent attacks.
"It is always good to be here as people are very lovely and friendly," said Australian golfer Marcus Both. "I came here 10 years ago. The perception is bad but in reality it is very different."
The 2009 attack on Sri Lanka's bus in Lahore, in which eight people were killed, caused all sporting visits to be suspended.
But successful military operations in the country's northwest near the Afghan border and crackdowns in urban centres, including the restive port city of Karachi, have improved the situation.
The country has twice hosted the Pakistan Super League cricket finals featuring international stars plus successful limited-over series against Zimbabwe, a World XI and Sri Lanka in the past 18 months.
They cleared the way for more sports with squash, tennis and now golf having returned.
Former Asian Tour winner and Indian national Digvijay Singh said arriving in Pakistan felt like home, suggesting sport could pave the road for better relations between Islamabad and Delhi.
"I am really feeling home here and we are so overwhelmingly welcomed here. We are seeing the same faces not different to us," Singh told reporters.
"Sports should bring the invisible walls down between the two countries," he added.
India-Pakistan ties, including sports and cultural contacts, plummeted after deadly 2008 attacks in Mumbai, which New Delhi blamed on Pakistani militants.
While cricket remains the undisputed number one sport in Pakistan, golf is popular with the country's powerful army, with military areas where the top brass reside frequently home to some of Pakistan's best courses.
Pakistan's Navy are hosting this week's Asian Tour event, which has a $300,000 prize fund. "There is a very overwhelming response by foreign players and that surprised us," said Naval Commodore Mushtaq Ahmed.
Pakistan hosted its first Asian Tour event in 1989, which was won by Filipino Frankie Minoza.
The country's only Asian Tour winner remains Taimur Hussain who triumphed at an event in Myanmar in 1998.  AFP

CCC workshop for boosting corporate performance
To overcome increasingly complex challenges in a fiercely competitive business world, commercial enterprises need leaders who can retain their staff and inspire them to serve fast-changing market needs better than their competitors. However, sharpening the leadership skills of managers is hindered by the absence of a simple and actionable framework for leadership skill development.
The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) in collaboration with Intrinsic Leadership Academy is organising a two-day workshop on practical leadership skill development aimed at boosting corporate performance under challenging conditions. It will be held at Movenpick Hotel Colombo on October 31 and November 1, from 8:30 am to 5 pm.
CCC has invited Dr Asoka Jinadasa to conduct this important workshop. He is a UK Chartered Engineer with a US PhD in Business Strategy and decades of top-level management experience in USA, Europe and Asia. He will share his award-winning new methodologies for leadership and human capital development, presented at 15 international conferences in 7 countries.
Managers vs. Leaders
As Dr Jinadasa explained, Being a leader is very different to leading a team or activity. Managers lead from the front while leaders lead from the back. Leaders must inspire and guide others to create the future of their organisations while consolidating present successes.
They must nurture new concepts that pave the way for future success, while recognising the underlying foundation of business uncertainty. Leaders thus need the Wisdom to know what to do next under unpredictably fast-changing conditions, and the Skills to do what is needed or get it done through others.
Character-Based Leaders
Not having a clear leadership model led to the proliferation of Position-Based Leaders where people in higher positions were considered leaders, without considering their ability to inspire and lead others.
This has been one of the biggest obstacles to organisational success. The flattening of organisational structures in response to fast-changing market conditions has created the demand for leadership skills at every level. This requires Character-Based Leaders who adopt a leaders attitudes and behaviours, regardless of their hierarchical position in the organisation. That is why great companies spend about 32% of their training budget on company-wide leadership development with the aim of becoming learning organisations.
Intrinsic LeadershipDevelopment
Intrinsic Leadership Development unleashes the natural abilities people at all levels instinctively use to guide their families to success, often under difficult conditions. This new approach helps them sharpen their vast inborn skills and helps them adopt a leaders attitudes and behaviours during their everyday work. Intrinsic leadership development is based on the finding that companies cannot sustain success in a turbulent world simply by following a specific set of steps, said Dr Asoka Jinadasa.
He and Lean Six-Sigma expert Arosha Jayasundera founded the Intrinsic Leadership Academy. Their 8,000-word website provides a wealth of insights into intrinsic leadership development: www.intrinleaders.com He will base this workshop on his6-dimensonal foundation introduced in his international award-winning self-coaching book Flying Penguin, and his 5-step framework for leadership development.
Six-DimensionalFoundation
His 6-dimensional holistic foundation for leadership skill development is symbolised by: Heart (intuition, and caring for all living beings and the environment); Mind (concrete, abstract, emotional and spiritual intelligence); Body (physical, mental and emotional energy); Passion (emotional fuel to achieve outstanding results); Focus (resilience to reach difficult goals despite setbacks) and Health (natural health under stressful working conditions).
Five-Step Framework
His 5-step framework for developing intrinsic leadership skills through human potential development: Leadership Foundation (Heart, Mind, Body, Passion, Focus and Health); Emotional Intelligence (understanding and managing negative emotions); Coaching and Mentoring (unleashinginborn human potential), Creativity and Innovation (nurturing creativity for focused innovation); Speaking and Presenting (speaking clearly and influencing others).
Target group and program benefits
CCC member companies and other organisations can benefit from this workshop by nominating their managers for sharpening their leadership skills and identifying new ways to guide their teams to reach higher levels of individual, team and corporate performance. Participants will receive comprehensive course notes, a certificate, and a soft copy of the book Flying Penguin.
CCC responds to anational need
Responding to national needs in the promotion of business is a major objective of CCC. One such need is the lack of practical leadership training geared to sustaining corporate performance in a turbulent business world. As a result, the corporate resources including human capital available in our country are not fully exploited. This has a negative impact on both corporate health and national competitiveness. This 2-day leadership workshop for boosting corporate performance addresses this need.

Action plan to recover the tax arrears
At present, there are 341 Councils operating in Sri Lanka.
a) Municipal 24, b) Urban 41, c) Divisional 276
It is very important that taxes are collected on time to fund necessary investments in public infrastructure services and well-targeted policies etc. Recently, Commissioner, Badulla Municipal Council had announced that about Rs. 80 million is in arrears. It is possible that total dues islandwide could be to the tune of billions. The ratepayers are -
a) Government Departments, b) Semi-Government Department, c) Private enterprises, d) Individuals
Several steps could be taken to collect all dues on time.
a) The issue of a warrant with penalty and cost, b) Seizure of property, c) Lien, d) Freezing of Bank accounts
It may be better to appoint private Tax Collectors for efficient action though it has some drawback. Recently Municipal Council for Dehiwela, Mt. Lavinia had called for a quotation to appoint private Tax Collectors. Others also could follow this. It is doubtful as to whether these steps could be taken in the case of Government Departments and Semi-Government Departments. Such matters should be referred to the respective Ministers and the Treasury. Even Parliament could take action if proper reports are submitted on time.
This is an appeal to President Maithripala Sirisena, for immediate action as this matter is of paramount importance.
The support of the powerful media should also be sought.

The de-civilising process
In his new book, In Pursuit of Civility, British historian Keith Thomas tells the story of the most benign developments of the past 500 years: the spread of civilised manners. In the 16th and 17th centuries many people behaved like barbarians. They delighted in public hangings and torture. They stank to high heaven. Samuel Pepys defecated in a chimney. Josiah Pullen, vice-principal of Magdalen Hall, Oxford, urinated while showing a lady around his college, still holding the lady fast by the hand. It took centuries of painstaking effort  sermons, etiquette manuals and stern lectures  to convert them into civilised human beings.
Reading Thomass book on a train recently I was gripped by a terrible realisation: everything our forebears worked so hard to achieve is now reversing. A process that took centuries has been undone in just a few decades.
There is no better place to observe the collapse of manners than on mass transport. The most basic move in the civilising process was to make a distinction between the public and the private: persuading people to defecate in lavatories rather than chimneys and eat at regular times in designated places, not whenever or wherever the mood took them. Yet today city streets reek of urine and trains smell of fast food. I recently had the misfortune to sit next to a quivering man-mountain on a train who proceeded to slurp a Coke, demolish a Big Mac, munch fries and spill ketchup onto his beard while giggling at a film on his super-sized iPad. His only concession to the fact that he wasnt in his own sitting room was to wear headphones.
Overnight flights are worse. Ive never witnessed anybody urinating on the back of an airline seat, as apparently happened on a Frontier Airlines plane this May. But Ive watched a man next to me floss his teeth and then carefully place the thread on the tray table, another do a vigorous push-up routine in the corridor, and a modern-day Henry VIII discard his chicken bones on the floor.
Enlightenment philosophers were convinced that the great engines of modernity  urbanisation, commerce and travel  would also spread civilisation. Commerce was supposed to polish peoples manners as well as fill their pockets. The closer association of people with each other would allow the masses to learn refinement. Today those very engines are turning against the civilising process. San Francisco is at the centre of the biggest creation of wealth on the planet, yet its streets are often littered with faeces, garbage and syringes.
The people who were supposed to act as guardians of high culture have collectively turned against it. Psychotherapists disparage self-restraint as a sign of unhealthy hang-ups. Academics are now so keen to denounce bourgeois civilisation as a tool of exploitation, patriarchy and/or misogyny that it can only be a matter of time before they start behaving like Josiah Pullen. One Cambridge economist, Victoria Bateman, turned up to a faculty meeting naked in protest at Britains vote to leave the EU. No wonder that todays young, the most educated generation in history, are more likely to model their style on the urban underclass than on yesterdays educated elite  hence the spread of tattoos, piercings and beards.
Civilisational decline is contagious: however hard you try to preserve your own manners you cant resist the general trend. Make way for someone in a queue at Starbucks and youll have to wait ages as they order some ridiculously convoluted drink and then take the only free table. Keep the seat next to you clear on a train and youll find yourself sitting next to somebody who decides to treat it like their own sofa.
I dont think Ill ever give in to the fashion for beards and tattoos, let alone turning up to meetings naked. But Ive noticed that I increasingly circumvent the normal rules of politeness in a desperate attempt to keep going. I carry a pair of headphones with me at all times to insulate myself from the noise of my neighbours. I sprint ahead if I see any possible competitors approaching the queue for coffee. And Ive graduated from putting my bag on the seat next to me on a train to a more cunning technique: I leave a copy of Jack Rosewoods The Big Book of Serial Killers on the chair and smile manically at anyone who comes anywhere near. So far the serial-killer strategy has worked remarkably well.

Developing Economies Call for Global Action to Contain Risks
Concern over rising risks to emerging market economies were centre stage this week as global Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors gathered in Bali, Indonesia yesterday.
Bali hosted both the biannual Ministerial Meeting of the Group of Twenty-Four (G-24) developing countries and the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group officials.
Global growth continues broadly but risks are rising for developing economies with higher oil prices, rising interest rates, high debt levels and the threat of trade war as top concerns, said Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Finance and Media for Sri Lanka and Chairman of the G-24. We urge major powers to reform and reinforce rather than discard the rules-based global trading system, Samaraweera said.
Volatile capital flows, foreign exchange pressures and higher borrowing costs have buffeted emerging markets as major economies have begun rolling back the very low interest rates that have prevailed since the 2008 global financial crisis. There is no avoiding the fact that the market for capital is global, which means policies and interest rates in advanced economies affect emerging and developing economies, said Julio Velarde, first vice-chair of the G-24 and Governor of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru.
Emerging markets that restrain debt levels and maintain prudent macroeconomic policies may weather volatility better but all emerging markets are adversely affected by excessive capital flow volatility, Velarde said.
G-24 and IMF/World Bank delegates discussed debt vulnerabilities that are rising in some developing countries, particularly low-income countries. According to the IMF, debt as a percentage of GDP has risen from 33 percent to 47 percent in the last 5 years for low-income countries. Such a rapid rise in debt and rates should be a concern to both creditors and debtors, which share a responsibility to foster debt transparency and sustainability, Samaraweera said.
In the context of recurring volatility, there are multilateral actions that could mitigate this damage to developing countries. The G-24 reiterated the importance of a strong Global Financial Safety Net, with an adequately resourced, quota-based IMF at its center, which has the resources needed to act decisively when needed. One-third of the IMFs lending resources will disappear next year when bilateral financing arrangements expire. Delegates said it is important that International Monetary Fund surveillance continues an even-handed and context-based assessment of macro-prudential and capital flow management measures, affording countries the latitude to implement appropriate measures to ensure financial stability. G-24 delegates agreed on a number of key measures to deal with the interrelated challenges of growth and debt: 1) Trade uncertainties and financial and monetary conditions compound rising debt vulnerabilities. Improving debt sustainability depends on a supportive external trade and financial environment, timely contingency financing and the adequate flow of concessional financing for LICs  which, let us remember, has been down by almost 20 per cent if we compare figures from 2013 to 2016. 2) We called for action from the IMF, WBG and multilateral partners and donors on capacity building for fiscal and debt management and sustainability and debt transparency. 3) We need to recognize the issue and try to improve the transparency around borrowing and recognize that both borrowers and lenders bear responsibility for ensuring sustainability. 4) On sovereign debt resolution, we have recognized that, with greater reliance on market-based finance, the challenges of maintaining debt sustainability and resolving sovereign debt crises evolve, and that we need a better framework to deal with such challenges.

Emojis, emotions and language
Over the past few years, language has been thrown into much debate and revolution with the rapid use of emojis. With its humble beginnings in Japan in 1999, emojis have come a long way to revolutionise and steer language on a different path. The word of the year in the Oxford Dictionaries in 2015 wasnt a word at all, to the surprise of many. It was the face with tears of joy emoji. The emoji was chosen as the word that best reflected the ethos, mood, and preoccupations of 2015, said the Oxford Dictionaries website.
In an unprecedented way, emojis have been able to communicate human emotions more effectively than words, on social media platforms. However, they have also caused much debate among linguists and the public about their application to language and emotions.
Emojis have also caused much controversy: in 2016, a 22-year-old Frenchman was sentenced to prison for three months after sending a pistol emoji to his ex-girlfriend. Apple later changed the look of the gun emoji from a revolver to a water gun due to rising gun threats and violence. In 2015, Instagram banned the aubergine emoji which was perceived to be rude and used sexually due to the aspects of the male anatomy. It was later reinstituted.
So what is this all about
History of the faces
The origin of the word emoji comes from Japanese where e signifies picture, mo means write and ji stands for character. Emojis were invented by a Japanese interface designer Shigetaka Kurita who produced the happy, sad, crazy, shock and angry emojis a within a grid measuring 1212 pixels which amounts to 144 dots, or 18 bytes of data, meaning that the Japanese designers complete set of 176 pictograms took up just over three kilobytes. A minuscule dose of information, but an enormous amount of meaning. In the present world, emojis are often created with vector graphics, so they can technically scale up to unlimited resolution.
Emoticons, on the other hand, were invented in September 1982 by American computer scientist Scott Fahlman. The original intention of using emoticons was to mark jokes and serious comments in the online bulletin boards of Carnegie Mellon Universitys computer science community. He proposed to use the emoticon :-) for jokes and the emoticon :-( for serious comments.
Emojis and emoticons are not one and the same. Emoticons use the letters and punctuation of the language to create faces, while emojis nowadays use vector graphics. I think they are ugly, and they ruin the challenge of trying to come up with a clever way to express emotions using standard keyboard characters. But perhaps thats just because I invented the other kind, said Fahlman in a recent interview conducted by the British online newspaper The Independent.
The facts
Emoticons and emojis have revolutionised language on a global scale with the technological advancements of the internet. Emojis are now ubiquitous with even national leaders using them on Tweets and teachers using them to grade exams.
Statistics have shown that there are 2,823 registered emojis on Unicode, the organisation that oversees the administration and creation of the symbols.
Back in June 2018, Facebook included five emoji reactions to posts, adding to the traditional Like button and Instagram was the latest customer to include personalised emoji shortcuts in the last month. Recent studies have found out that six billion emojis are sent every day throughout the world and 70 percent are used to convey emotions.
A website containing every detail of emojis named Emojipedia was launched in 2013 which acts an emoji database equivalent to Wikipedia. Artist Joe Hale retold Alice in Wonderland using only emojis: over 25,000 emojis were used which spanned over 300 hours to get the story completed. In 2017, The Emoji Movie was released where all the characters were emojis.
However, it failed to create an impact with a rating of only 3.2 on IMDb.
Experts have their say
Professor Vyvyan Evans, author of the book The Emojicode, says that emojis are a form of punctuation that supplements the written language. Not a writing system per se, but a supplement and a complement to writing to add emotions to digital communication platforms. He further emphasises that emojis cannot be perceived as a language since they do not have an extensive vocabulary and grammatical system.
However, they enable us to express emotion and empathy in digital communication which take on certain aspects of face-to-face interactions. They enable us to express our emotional selves much more effectively than the written word, he said in a BBC interview.
Emojis and language
Emojis cannot be put into the language category directly as they lack the tenses, prepositions, syntax and activepassive voice essential for complex communication.
Dr. Mark McGlashan, an expert in corpus-based discourse studies and Lecturer in English Language at Birmingham City University says that emojis and language are not opposing concepts. Rather, they can convey the same meanings in a different way. One is pictorial, while the other is linguistic. Language has a particular set of resources to convey emotion  a simple example is to look at adjectives and adverbs, which help us describe things in language. But emojis can add emotion to a message in a different, visual way to enhance the language used. Emojis can help us express things that might be difficult to do using language alone, he said.
Recipe for disaster or revolutionary concept
According to Dr. McGlashan, linguists have long been interested in descriptivist and prescriptivist approaches to language. While some believe that there is a single correct way to use language (prescriptivists), which includes ideas about what kinds of grammar or spelling are right or wrong, linguists typically take a descriptive approach to language and try to understand how and why people communicate using the kinds of language that they do.
Some people dont like emojis just because they dont like them. Saying it shouldnt be used because I dont like emojis is a bit dangerous. Emojis can help us communicate better, they supplement language. But I doubt wed have been able to have this entire conversation just by using emojis, he said.
Regulation
The Unicode Consortium is an independent regulatory board that standardises and governs the software coding of text and oversees the administration and creation of the symbols. Their task is to censor and rule on all matters of standards, like a governing body, with major tech companies such as Google, Apple and Oracle. The Unicode Consortium was responsible for the standardisation of emojis in 2010 which enabled users to communicate emojis over various networks. The consortium currently has 2,823 registered emojis which are in use all over the world. Although different renditions and adaptations could differ on various platforms, the type of emoji would be the same. Therefore, if a new emoji is to be produced, it needs to be vetted and debated upon. The process could take over 18 months.
Room for development
Although emojis have started to portray mythical and abstract ideas like vampires, aliens, ghosts, and skulls, they still have room for improvement with the exclusion of some everyday objects. Though emojis include modern-day clothing like skirts and t-shirts, there could be emojis of a sari in the near future, which is worn more times than frocks, kimonos or bikinis. The exclusion of mango as a fruit comes as a bit of shock to Asians. And maybe an emoji of a three-wheeler could be included among the fancy cars and planes. After all, its a common way of transport in Asia. In a local context, emojis of traffic jams and joint families could make our lives much easier when texting and popular local activities of pulling hair out in frustration or even an emoji of bribing could make the cut!
The future of emojis looks as bright as ever with new concepts and ideas coming up daily. Major strides are taken by media giants to develop the emojis to moving dynamic avatars.
The world is an everchanging arena with new inventions, concepts and ideas which we are all a part of. We eagerly await the next invention which would take a revolutionary step towards the future in the perception of both language and emotion.

Enjoy blackest coffee with choc croc
The coffee drink maybe dark, but it might make your smile pearly white. De Vos Cafe has introduced two unique and delicious items to their menu with the introduction of Colombos Blackest Coffee (CBC) and the divine Nutella filled Kimbula bun. The beverage is made using a natural truly Sri Lankan ingredient coconut, where the flesh is charred, grounded and mixed with handpicked spices ensuring the best of Sri Lanka.
The cafes owners gathered inspiration for the CBC on a visit to New York, where a Korean Caf was making matte black lattes using coconut shell ash. The CBC is completely different to its New York counterpart and is a delicious black iced drink made by blending whip cream with a blend of freshly brewed espressoand local powdered coffee, flavoured with a mix of aromatic Sri Lankan spices and burnt coconut shavings to get its unique look and flavour.
The CBC is definitely an Instagram worthy drink but what tops it off is the Sri Lankan classic the Kimbula bunis, which has been enhanced with a filling of Nutella and aptly called the Choc Croc. Ensuring the best in quality and freshness De Vos Caf has an in-house bakery which guarantees freshly baked goods on their shelves every day.

Fitch Assigns Dialog Finance First-Time AA(lka) Rating; Outlook Stable
Fitch Ratings Lanka Limited has assigned Dialog Finance PLC (DF) a National Long-Term Rating of AA (lka). The Outlook is Stable.
DFs rating reflects Fitchs view that support would be forthcoming from Dialog Axiata PLC (Dialog), the largest mobile-telecommunication and pay-TV operator in Sri Lanka. The assessment is based on Dialogs 98.9% equity stake, DFs high operational and management integration with the parent and the common Dialog brand.
Dialogs credit profile and its ability to support DF is reflected in its AAA(lka)/Stable rating, which is underpinned by its standalone strength. DF is rated two notches below its parent because of its limited importance to Dialogs core business as the subsidiary was only acquired in September 2017. DF would support Dialogs aspiration to expand its digital financial services in Sri Lanka via the fintech business model but we do not expect the segment to provide a material contribution to the groups core business in the medium term.
DFs synergies with the parent are high as its new business model is likely to leverage on Dialogs technical competencies. DFs management and operational integration with the parent is also likely to remain high. Fitch expects DF to initially focus on Dialogs subscriber base and is also likely to utilise Dialogs mobile platforms to support its financial transactions. The company launched its new business model in April 2018 that provides financing for the purchase of devices such as mobile phones and routers sold by Dialog. The device-financing business accounted for 24% of DFs total loans at end-June 2018.
DFs standalone rating is weaker than its support-driven rating due to its small franchise, untested underwriting standards and weak asset quality as well as profitability. The companys asset-quality metrics are weaker than those of the industry average, mainly stemming from its legacy portfolio. DFs reported regulatory gross non-performing loan ratio of 14.5% at end-June 2018 (end of financial year to 31 March 2018 (FYE18): 14.1%) was significantly above the industry average of 6.8%.
DFs capitalisation improved following an equity infusion of LKR599 million in June 2018, which saw the companys debt/tangible equity ratio fall to 0.8x at end-June 2018, from 2.2x at FYE18 (FY17: 2.0x). We expect its leverage to rise moderately amid its above-industry growth expectations, but its leverage is likely to remain better than peers in the medium term. We also expect Dialog to infuse capital at regular intervals to enable DF to meet the enhanced regulatory minimum capital requirement of LKR2.5 billion by 1 January 2021 if DFs earnings generation is insufficient to comply with the requirement.

As such the school has invested in a large property in Ratmalana, which houses a football field of the highest standards where this tournament will be staged. This year the school will partner with the Football Federation to organize an exciting event for Under 20 players of the TISSL schools.
In May 2014 the Federation organized the first Under 19 schools football tournament which gives promising school athletes an opportunity to become national stars. Gateway College was among the four international schools that participated in that inaugural event.
A memorandum of understanding will be signed between Gateway College and The Football Federation of Sri Lanka, who will henceforth jointly organize this annual event.
We need to see more schools participating and I am expecting to promote more young teams through our federation in future, said Anura De Silva, President Football Federation Of Sri Lanka at the press briefing held at the FFSL Auditorium.
Dr. Harsha Alles, Chairman Gatway Group stressed that whether the teams win or loose must have a good dicipline and its a new begining and also we must promote the game among other schools too. The Gatway Graduate School support the event for the youngsters to show their talents with higher standards he said.

Goat brigades help battle Portugals wildfires
PORTUGAL: Fernando Moura and his herd may not look like heroes but the Portuguese farmer and his 370 goats are the latest recruits in the country's battle against summer forest fires.
Hoping to contain wildfires that threaten its mountains each year, Portugal's government has hired goats to munch through undergrowth and create natural, cost-effective fire barriers.
Soaring temperatures often spark blazes across Portugal's mountain ranges, forcing authorities to dispatch hundreds of firefighters, soldiers and water-dumping aircraft.
More than 100 people were killed in the country's wildfires last year, prompting criticism from firefighters over a lack of government coordination.
Moura's four-legged brigade are part of a pilot project, started earlier this year, to clear combustible scrubland from some of Portugal's major mountain ranges.
Authorities hope the firefighting goats will help stop blazes spreading from one forest to another and better contain any fires.
In the past we never used to have such massive fires like today. We used to have thousands of animals cleaning up by grazing and there were hundreds of herders like me, Moura told AFP.
Now I am almost the last. For the next five years, Moura and his goats have one mission -- to roam across the slopes of the central Serra da Estrela range and clear around 50 hectares (123.5 acres) of scrubland to create the natural firewalls.
Around 40 goat herders are taking part across the country in the initiative, which is expected to show results quickly although officials say a full evaluation of its efficiency will only come at the end of its five year-run.
Better able to access remote, rocky areas, goats may be more effective than men in bulldozers on the mountain slopes.
It's the most natural and cost-effective method, said Antonio Borges, head of Portugal's Institute for Nature Conservation and Forests, or ICNF.
At dawn, every day of the year, Moura looks out on the slopes and ridges of the Serra da Estrela national park, one of the highest peaks on the Portuguese mainland.
Thick walking stick in hand, the 49-year-old herder appears as quick and sure in step as his herd as he cajoles the animals with whistles perfected over a lifetime on the mountainside.
For his work, Moura gets paid 125 euros ($144) for each hectare cleared in the first year, and 25 euros per hectare for each of the following four years. A small supplement comes from goat milk cheese and meat.
In Portugal's hilly interior regions, many residents have left for lives elsewhere. Only the elderly remain in some villages, leaving abandoned fields easy prey for flames.
There is a lot of wild vegetation left around our villages, Moura said, perched on a huge granite outcrop overlooking the slopes.
After last year's fatal wildfires, this summer was calmer, with significantly fewer fires started, burned surfaces reduced by 60 percent from the average of the last 10 years and no deaths.
Still, in August, wildfires burned the Algarve region, threatening the tourist destination.
Portugal remains very vulnerable, said Tiago Oliveira, head of a team of experts charged by the government with reforming fire prevention strategies.
New initiatives for forest management will take decades to produce results. It's a long-term task. For Moura and his herd, the day's work ends at sunset, when the goats are left with his sheep dogs in an enclosure set among the imposing mountains, while Moura returns to his village in the valley with the goats' milk for his wife to make cheese.
Next morning, he's up again early and headed back to the slopes for what for him is a labour of love.
My goats, I really like them. It's me who created this herd, he said. I tried once working in a factory. But it wasn't for me. I could never abandon my goats. - AFP

Grama niladaris threaten TU action
Representatives of the Grama Niladaris Association urged the government to rectify several issues relating to their service, at a media conference in Colombo on Wednesday.
They warned the government not to force them to opt for trade union action by not heeding their issues.
Government Grama Niladaris Association (GGNA) Chairman U.A.D.S. Perera said they were contemplating trade union action in the near future. As an initial step, leaflets were distributed to make people aware about their issues.
Speaking on their demands, he said that they need an incentive for assisting the process of issuing identity cards. Besides, they asked for a service minute relating to their service.
We had around 25 rounds of discussions with several ministries and authorities about the issues we have relating to our service. But those authorities have failed to rectify them, he said.
Perera said the government has not taken measures to provide separate offices for them, as most of the offices are at religious places such as temples, or at rented rooms.
Even though there are 14,000 Grama Niladaris in the country, the government has constructed only 2,000 officers so far, Perera said.

He took cricket to the pinnacle
It was during his short reign that cricket reached its pinnacle. He brought about a renaissance in the game that finally culminated in Sri Lanka winning the 1996 World Cup in Lahore, Pakistan that stunned the cricket world.
He was none other than the bespectacled Millfield School, Somerset, England educated ANA PUNCHIHEWA who did big things for the game by meticulously planning and executing a plan that finally ended up in hitherto unattained success in the history of the game in the country. PUNCHIHEWA is our SPORTS LEGEND .
PUNCHIHEWA who has not played big cricket, was a cricket fanatic and watching the talent from the boundary that was oozing in the game, he was confident that if he took strike as President of Sri Lanka Cricket he could, to use a biblical term, take the game to the promised land.
Cricketing miracle
And to acknowledge that he performed a cricketing miracle is no misnomer. He had read the wicket on which the game was struggling. He realized that if properly chartered by the right plan of action that he would execute it with precision if he was to head SLC. But his longing did not take time to materialize. Once installed in the saddle, he immediately donned pads in cricketing parlance, played strokes that were going to bring big runs for the game, and also silence his critics who were questioning his experience and knowledge in the game. He put on a helmet to avoid the bouncers bowled by his critics and went about batting and scoring like a Brian Lara of the West Indies. His successful corporate and business experience came in handy and did not tolerate those who minded other people's (his) business.
While serving SLC as Vice President to GAMINI DISSANAYAKE who did wonders for the game, PUNCHIHEWA had all the freedom and support that he needed.
On equal terms
After DISSANAYAKE saw to it that we sat at the table with the ICC lords on equal terms, PUNCHIHEWA installed the needed wherewithal for the game to take Sri Lanka to the pinnacle with a crack team.
Taking the hot seat in cricket PUNCHIHEWA initially streamlined the SLC. Being the head of a leading soft drink company Pure Beverages which beverage he made a best seller, he used that acumen to make cricket too a best seller in the Country. And that he succeeded in that attempt is still credited to his administrative capabilities.
Once elected to the high office of President of SLC he quickly got his 'eye' in like good batsmen do. And played strokes that brought success all round. He realized that the SLC Constitution, the domestic cricket set up and was determined to run SLC like he did his successful soft drink company.
More into golf
PUNCHIHEWA was more into golf and played that game with confidence and looked poised to be a champion. But having served under Dissanayake after being President of Galle Cricket Club, it was cricket that caught his fancy. He was confident that he had the panacea for the ills afflicting the game and if elected to the high post, he could deliver and make the game the best in the world.
Two years as Vice President was enough for him to get accoustom to the wicket that was SLC and get his tactics right. Once in the hot seat, having watched the immense talent that was floating aimlessly, he realized that it was confidence that was the important ingredient that the players missed.
His first stroke was while motivating the players was to make a bold statement that he was going to make the game the best in the world in 2000. This statement made his critics laugh.
Disastrous Indian tour
Firstly the team made a disastrous tour of Indian in 1995 losing--- believe it or not, all three Tests against India by innings on the fourth day before lunch. Those defeats still remain an unsolved mystery. The team was led by Arjuna Ranatunga.
Unable to hide that shame that was India, PUNCHIHEWA believed and was confident that it was a foreign coach that was needed to put the cricketers and the game right. Against opposition he took the bold step to recruit former Sri Lanka born Aussie Dave Whatmore and put him in charge while including former captain Duleep Mendis as manager. He gave the coach, the manager and the players a pep talk and told them that he would provide them with everything they needed and insisted on them that they show results. Hey presto! And a hitherto unseen transformation took place.
At loggerheads
Sri Lanka had been at loggerheads with Australia for calling Muttiah Muralitheran which nearly put him out of the game for good. And destiny had it that we meet Australia in the World Cup final in Lahore, Pakistan in 1996.
The fire in the belly to beat Australia was tremendous and when it came to the crunch, were all poised to fire and bring down the high riding and pompous Australians led by Mark Tubby Taylor. And what happened on that day at the Gadaffi Stadium is history and needs no reiteration. The victory stunned not only Australia, the cricket world but sent all Sri Lankans, wherever they were living, into raptures and ecstasy. Celebrations lasted for months.
Over the moon feeling
And the man who had that above the moon feeling was President of Sri Lanka Cricket ANA PUNCHIHEWA who had his dream come true. It is said that dreams rarely come true. But for PUNCHIHEWA it had come true. Success has many fathers and failures are orphans. While PUNCHIHEWA was a key architect, he has no ego in sharing this success with others!
Amidst the adulations, the celebrations and the congratulatory messages that were pouring in, and before the sounds of fire cracker lighting could go silent, was held the AGM of SLC.
In appreciation in making the impossible, possible and when it was thought that not only was it going to be a cake walk or that that PUNCIHEWA would be uncontested and given another innings, descended the vultures to prey on the goodies that were going to flow into the coffers of SLC.
Ousted from the kings seat
And it was like a bomb exploding to find PUNCHIHEWA ousted from the kings seat which shocked not only the man who made it all possible, also the cricket world. Thats ingratitude in its vile definition. 'Mans inhumanity to man was never better exemplified than with the ousting of PUNCHIHEWA. That was the beginning of the collapse of the game which is still gasping for breath.
Those who schemed the ousting of PUNCHIHEWA were not greedy for money. They had it in abundance. What they sought was fame. And it was not fame that they achieved, but shame and though not obvious their conscience will tell them that it is tags of shame that they still carry with them two decades later after that historic achievement.
Carries no ill will
What is admirable, appreciated and an example is that PUNCHIHEWA carries no ill will against those who did him in, but forgives them  for they know not know what they do  to quote the Almighty. PUNCHIHEWA would be willing to play another innings but on condition that the Constitution of Sri Lanka Cricket is changed. And it is more than time that it is done. [emailprotected]

Heart rate app
With the new Apple Watch capable of recording the heart rhythm and providing an ECG (Electro Cardiograph) for the common man, management of diabetes is heading towards a paradigm shift.
Since ages, researchers were confronted with the challenge of very low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) induced changes in cardiac rhythm and even sudden death of patients with diabetes. Many new medications and technologies for diabetes have been developed exclusively with the advantage of preventing hypoglycaemia to save the lives.
The treatment of diabetes is heading towards a paradigm shift with features like heart rhythm recording available along with new wearable devices and the simultaneous recording of glucose levels continuously and the introduction of newer gadgets with improved accuracy, said Dr Jothydev Kesavadev while delivering the Diacon Gold Medal Oration at International Diabetes Convention, Ahmedabad.
All stages of diabetes require the use of technologies for an in-depth evaluation, treatment or both. Diabetes being a silent killer, patients often used these technologies only for treating the expensive complications of the disease such as those affecting the heart, kidney, sexual organs and the eye. Instead, the early use of technologies for prevention of complications, when patients are still free of symptoms of the disease are to be encouraged to retain the quality of life and avoid future treatment costs, said Dr.Jothydev.
There are 74 million people in India affected by diabetes, 60 percent of whom do not even know they have the disease. Diabetes is the leading cause of heart attacks, dialysis, blindness, leg amputations, and stroke. All these complications are preventable only when more and more patients, as well as the public, become aware of comprehensive disease management which is far beyond merely controlling the blood sugars.
At the function, senior diabetologist and founder president of RSSDI (Research Society for the study of Diabetes in India), Prof O.P Gupta, Diacon chairman Banshi Saboo and Dr.Asha. N. Shah handed over the Diacon Gold Medal to Dr.Jothydev Kesavadev in recognition of his research and accomplishments in preventing complications with the help of diabetes technologies.

Hydropower purchases under scrutiny
An organisation of concerned individuals said their organisation will take a legal action against purchasing electricity at high prices by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).
Ape Sri Lanka (Our Sri Lanka) President Vimukthi Dushantha addressing the media said a huge racket when purchasing hydropower from private hydropower plants. The CEB has planned to purchase a unit of hydro power for Rs 8.48 from 16 private power generating companies even though the CEB can purchase a unit for Rs 5.23.
At present, the CEB purchases a unit of hydro power for Rs 5.23 from ten small scale hydropower generating private companies. The Power and Renewable Energy Ministry has forwarded a Cabinet paper to purchase power at an high price from 16 other small scale hydropower generating private companies.The unit cost has been estimated at Rs 8.48 per unit he said.
According to him these small scale hydropower plants have been come to effect from 1996. Those companies entered into agreements with the CEB in connection with selling hydropower to the CEB for 15 year period. Most of those agreements had come to end by 2010 or 2011.
Then the Ministry appoint an expert committee to form a fresh agreement for purchasing hydropower from these 26 private companies. As par the committee reports 10 companies have agreed to sell 1 unit of hydropower for Rs 5.23 each. But the other 16 companies insisted on the Ministry officials to forward a cabinet paper seeking high price per unit. According to the cabinet paper, a unit of hydropower is going to be purchased by the CEB for Rs 8.48 from the 16 companies despite a unit could be purchased for Rs 5.23 he said.
This is clearly a racket, he noted. As a result of this monetary misconduct, the CEB will have to bare an additional cost of Rs 3,500 million per year.
Vimukthi said that the Ape Sri Lanka orgainisation will take a legal action to protect the misuse of public wealth.

ICRA Lanka assigns [SL] B rating  to Nations Lanka Finance
ICRA Lanka Limited, subsidiary of ICRA Limited, a group company of Moodys Investors Service, has assigned the issuer rating of [SL]B (Pronounced SL B) with a stable outlook to Nations Lanka Finance PLC (NLF or the company).
The rating considers NLFs moderate scale, modest asset quality, constrained funding profile and weak profitability indicators. NLFs core capital as in June 2018 stood at Rs 705 million, below the regulatory requirement of Rs 1 billion for Licenced Finance Companies (LFCs).
ICRA Lanka takes note of the rights issue of Rs 600 million in September 2018, which uplifted the companys capitalisation to an extent; however the capital profile is expected to remain subdued considering the new CBSL norms for capital adequacy computation. Further, NLF would require sizeable external capital infusion (about Rs 1.4-1.5 billion over the period FY2019-FY2021, with adequate buffer), in relation to its net worth, as internal generation is expected to remain modest.
ICRA Lanka takes note of the participation of some key shareholders (constituting about 60% of the shareholding in Jun-18) in the recent rights issues and subordinated debenture issuance of the company. However, support from them going forward, considering NLF future capital requirements, remains to be seen.

Impressive Djokovic gets revenge to make Shanghai quarters
Shanghai, Thursday: Novak Djokovic enjoyed a measure of revenge as he booked his spot in the Shanghai Masters quarter-finals with a 6-4, 6-0 demolition of Marco Cecchinato on Thursday.
The Serbian second seed was stunned by the Italian -- ranked 72 in the world at the time -- in the French Open quarter-finals earlier this year.
It was part of the wretched run of form Djokovic suffered in the first half of the year after elbow surgery in February.
But the world number three exploded back to life in the northern hemisphere summer, winning Wimbledon, the Cincinnati Masters and US Open.
The 31-year-old, who is now gunning for Rafael Nadals number one ranking, says he is back close to the kind of blistering form that has brought him 14 Grand Slams.
And he proved it against Cecchinato, bustling past the 16th seed in just under 70 minutes.
Djokovic will play South Africas Kevin Anderson or the Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarter-finals.
Rising star Alexander Zverev was similarly emphatic as he brushed aside Australias new number one, teenager Alex de Minaur, 6-1, 6-4.
The German fourth seed will face 11th seed Kyle Edmund in the last eight.
The 21-year-old Zverev was ruthless as he took the first set in just 29 minutes, although his 19-year-old opponent showed more fight in the second.
Zverev has been suffering with a cold but ratcheted up the pressure to grab the all-important break of serve in the ninth game before closing out the match against de Minaur, who this week replaced Nick Kyrgios as Australias top-ranked player.
Edmund, Britains number one, defeated Chiles Nicolas Jarry 7-6 (7/5), 6-3. AFP

Indian Ocean shouldnt become like South China Sea - Harsha
We must ensure that the issues in the South China Sea do not happen in the Indian Ocean, said State National Policies and Economic Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva to a panel at the Indian Ocean: Defining our Future Conference, at Temples Trees, yesterday.
But the State Ministers appeal for a common maritime vision for the region may prove to be difficult to sell to one of the worlds least connected regions.
Key questions with regard to safety and security of the region depend on whether littoral states are willing to rise above strategic mistrust and reach a common understanding which benefits all, said the State Minister.
He suggested that mechanisms and operational measures could be developed if all could reach a common consensus.
Indias Deputy National Security Advisor Pankaj Saran, also addressing the panel, said that India-led regional organisations like the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) and Indian Ocean Naval Symposium at present offered good multilateral forums for discussion and all cooperation must reflect diversity among littoral states such as size, resources, levels of development and security.
The common good of the Indian Ocean requires collective respect, sovereign equality and a common spirit of cooperation instead of competition, and the rule of law needs to be respected. Interests of others cannot be harmed in this process.
In the years ahead, he said India would engage more extensively in the maritime domain and would value Sri Lanka as a valuable partner and the countrys independent role in realising the common good of the Indian Ocean region,
We should not return to an era of great power rivalries. An Asia of rivalry will hold us all back, but an Asia of cooperation will shape the century.
Director-General of the Boundary and Ocean Affairs Department of the Chinas Foreign Affairs Ministry, Yi Xianliang, observed that there were over 10,000 regulations prescribed by regional and UN bodies when it came to navigation and security, but interactions and connectivity between the over two billion people in the South Asian region remained low.
He said that whilst China fully respected UNCLOS, they would need time to consider the details of any agreement proposed at the forum. China has always preferred to deal with nations bilaterally rather than through multilateral organisations.
Yi also clarified that despite concerns, the Belt and Road Initiative was an economic endeavour and was not for political or security reasons.
Eighty percent of Chinese trade worth US$ 4 trillion must go through sea lanes and 50 percent of that passes through the Indian Ocean. So no one is more concerned about safety and security of navigation than China.
Yi however stressed that the priority for the region should be peace and sustainable development.
A more detached response came from US Department of States Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Ambassador Alice G. Wells when she said the priority for the United States in the region was a strong, prosperous and self-reliant Indian Ocean region.
She highlighted several initiatives the US was currently funding to support maritime security, improve capacity and further information-sharing in the region.
In addition, she said the US government was encouraging more private-sector-led growth in the region, as the only form of long-term development, especially in their areas of focus: infrastructure, digital economy and energy.
Wells encouraged states to renegotiate tariffs and custom procedures to increase intra-regional trade which currently stands at less than five percent.
It is cheaper for India to trade with Brazil than its neighbours, said Wells. South Africas International Relations and Cooperation Department Deputy Director-General and Chair, Committee of Senior Officials of IORA, Dr. Anil Sooklal said that the increasing number of military bases in the Indian Ocean was worrying in terms of rivalry and that a robust and honest discussion would be needed if it was to remain a zone of peace as first proposed by Sri Lanka in 1971.

Investigations done, but no report, says wife
Sandhya Ekneligoda said that although several investigations have been carried out into the disappearance of her husband, journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda, none of the investigation reports have been made available to her so far.
She alleged that there are certain sections of the Army which may hide the investigation reports compiled by the Army into the disappearance of her husband.
Ekneligoda said investigations into the disappearance of her husband were undertaken following several appeals made by her to the government.
Ekneligoda was speaking to the media after she called on the Most Ven. Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter at the Malwatte Viharaya in Kandy and received his blessings yesterday.
Ekneligoda said she called on the Malwatte Prelate to brief him on the proposed religious satyagraha she had planned. She said that it was the Rajapaksa regime which was responsible for the disappearance of her husband. She had no doubt about it. But there was a possibility of sections of the Army trying to send the reports of investigations made by the Army, underground.
There is doubt about the release of such reports in a situation where the President is protected by the Armed forces, she said.
Ekneligoda said she has made many attempts to meet the President to inform him about the injustice caused to her, but she has never received an opportunity to do so. She also inquired from the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) about the whereabouts of her husband, but the OMP has not found a solution to her problem, since it remains an office only.

When lawyers threatened to down tools 60 years ago:
Justice delayed for the legal fraternity
What did George Bernard-Shaw mean by his statement, All professions are conspiracies against the laity: Professions acquire status, authority and wealth by taking unto themselves, (in Sri Lankan context thanks to free education), a body of knowledge and proficiency and only renounce it in small amounts in exchange for a fee.
Named after Hulft, the Dutch General who was shot by a Portuguese soldier in 1656 the village where the gruesome murder took place happened to be known as Hulfts Dorp, (dorp in Dutch means village) soon became Hulftsdorp, the hub of Sri Lankas legal fraternity. While the lawyers upheld the decorum and dignity of the profession, the medical profession in Government service seems to have deviated and lost track, and is busy with regular press briefings on struggles, mostly on issues that do not affect them or the society at large, apart from a small group of their memberships political interests. Why do their counterparts, the lawyers, do not believe in such struggles
This writers speculation in this regard prompted him to dig into the archives related to Hulftsdorp and trace the historical records on lawyers collective agitations, attitudes and approaches on certain issues affecting their professional carriers in contemporary politics. He came across an instance of lawyers threatening a down-tools 60 years ago in 1958, opposing the Justice Minister in the SWRD Bandaranaike government, M W H de Silva (Lawyer/Senator and grand uncle of State Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva), against his proposal to introduce an enactment aimed at scuttling their freedom in levying fee from clients, which the Minister termed as irrational or arbitrary by lawyers. The Bar Council met and passed a resolution condemning the idea, also decided to launch trade union action.
The minister wanted to regulate the levying of fees by the proctors and advocates, (as the lawyers were categorised then; like barristers and solicitors in England and in most other Commonwealth nations), before Administration of Justice Law was enacted in 1973 when all became Attorneys-at-Law.
The minister referred to numerous complaints being received regarding irregularities committed by proctors in connection with cases entrusted to them, the term irregularities can mean failure on the part of a proctor to diligently attend to a case in all its stages or failure to apply the funds entrusted to him in the manner it should have been or recovering fees in excess of what are legally chargeable or misappropriating monies that should have been paid to his clients.
The proposed legislation is intended, it is stated, to ensure public confidence in the members of the profession. The obvious reason for the proposal is that the profession as a whole could not be trusted.
All Island Lawyers Meet
The excerpts from statements made by lawyers at the meeting of lawyers associations to discuss the principle of ministerial, executive or legislative control of the internal organisation of the legal profession was taken up. Every bar in the outstations was represented.
Excerpts:
Proctors are not unmindful of the standards required of their profession: These are however not to be achieved by imposing impracticable and impossible legislation.
There can be no objection to any requirement that a proctor shall issue receipts for all sums he received. A proctor should be required to obtain a receipt from advocates to whom he pays any fees and advocates should be prohibited from receiving fees except through proctors.
The legislation is totalitarian in outlook and is a departure from democratic principles and the tradition associated with the legal profession. It proceeds on the assumption that the public and the state requirements to be protected against the profession. It is an unreserved reflection on the whole profession and affects the honour and the prestige which the profession had deservedly enjoyed over a century.
Senior Counsel S. Nadesan, raising a point of order, said that he had no objection to an informal discussion of problem common to proctors and advocates. But it was undesirable that resolutions of any kind be put to the house and voted on such resolutions should be considered separately by the Law Society in the case of proctors and by the general council of advocates, in the case of Advocates. Thiagalingam QC objected to the point of order.
Weeramanthri Vs Nadesan
E G Wickremanayke in Chair then ruled against the point of order.
He informed the members that the Justice Minister told a deputation of the Bar Council that morning that he would not proceed with the legislation if lawyers themselves took steps to check any abuses within the profession.
C. G. Weeramanthri QC said that if ministers controlled the legal profession, it will not function efficiently, and public confidence cannot be maintained or generated by rules and regulations. The lawyer-client relationship was one of trust and the imposition of controllers of fees would take away the public confidence built up by the devoted service of generations of lawyers. Regarding the ministers statement that proctors evaded the payment of tax he said, I have it on authority that there was no more honourable body of taxpayers in this country than lawyers. The ministers proposal, he argued, was unnecessary as there existed organisations to take disciplinary action against defaulting members of the profession. The minsters remedy must not control the profession by regulations, but increase the powers of the governing bodies of the profession.
He observed: Some of our rules of professional duties and customs and institutions, borrowed as they are from the UK may be a little out of date. If so, it should be left to the good sense of the profession to eliminate any hardship that may be caused to litigants. We oppose the appointment of a controller of fees, as a further interference for four reasons: Extra inconvenience to clients; possible abuses in controllers office; opposition to the principle of administrative regulation, and waste. We also oppose the ministers plan of having a schedule of fees. This will give the minister power to fix a high or low scale.
Weeramantri concluded: It is our duty as professional men to be watchful and warn the public of the dangerous trends in legislation and guard against the extension of bureaucratic control. The reported move to prevent ministerial orders from being subject to review by courts takes away the undoubted and unalienable right of every citizen in a democracy to appeal to the courts. It is our duty as professionals to condemn such legislation.
However S. Nadesan emphasized that since the two professions were creatures of statute it was not proper for them to protest against legislative control. Certainly, we can protest against Ministerial and Executive control but not against Legislative control over the profession, he added, just as much as government had the right to control wages and even prices of provisions by legislation, they had the right to control the fees of lawyers too.
Speaking on the resolution, Issadeen Mohomed said that if lawyers did not speak on behalf of public they were a disgraceful lot. We must speak without fear. He said the government must not set up a CID unit to go behind lawyers.
V. Kumarasamy said: Everything has gone, and only the Independence of Judiciary remains. They are trying to invade this field. They want to control our fees and then they will also try to control our arguments, he remarked.
The resolution was passed by a thumping majority.
There is the usual affinity between politics and the legal profession. This is so in almost all democratic nations. Lawyers always play an active role in politics. Their comprehensive knowledge of the law, the judicial system and the constitution facilitate them to be dynamic in politics. They take up issues of public interest, political and fundamental rights, which in turn, pushes them into the political arena. Most of them reach various legislative bodies, Cabinet and other administrative and political positions.
Whilst numerous complaints of alleged malpractices of proctors may have been received by the Justice Ministry, the criterion should not be the number of such reports but the number of cases of irregularities has been established. It is known that 80% or more of the complaints which are received on the face of them do not merit further consideration and are misconceived.
Legal practitioners should perform themselves with integrity, and promote public confidence in the judiciary. Lawyers are obligatory and expected to deal with clients with courtesy and honesty. They must not engage in conduct which is deceitful or disreputable, which would diminish the public confidence in the profession, especially in charging fees.

Current Chief Justice Priyasath Dep completes his term today (12). Constitutionally, the President must forward the name of his nominee for Chief Justice to the Constitutional Council which must then approve the nomination.
If the appointment of the Chief Justice is delayed the President can appoint an acting Chief Justice for a period of 14 days.

Kohli shields Indias boy wonder  from Tendulkar shadow
HYDERABAD, Thursday - Virat Kohli sought to protect prolific teenager Prithvi Shaw Thursday from the weight of comparisons with India legend Sachin Tendulkar after the young batsmans Test debut century last week.
Another century in the second match against the West Indies which begins on Friday in Hyderabad would see Shaw join a small group of greats including Mohammad Azharuddin, Sourav Ganguly and Rohit Sharma who all hit tons in their first two Tests.
The 18-year-old became Indias youngest player to score a debut century and his countrys second youngest in all Tests after Tendulkar -- who was 17 when he made an unbeaten 119 against England in his ninth Test.
Shaws sparkling 134 in the first Test rout in Rajkot had some commentators dubbing him Indias boy wonder ahead of the tour of Australia next month.
But captain Kohli warned Indias notoriously demanding fans not to expect too much too soon from Shaw, who was earmarked as a future star when as a 14-year-old he hit a record 546 off 330 balls in a Mumbai school game in 2013.
We are all very happy for him but I dont think we should compare him to anyone yet or we should put him in a space where he starts feeling pressure, Kohli told reporters.
He should be left to enjoy his cricket and slowly grow into the cricketer that we all believe he can be, said Kohli who hailed the diminutive right hander as supremely talented.
He has shown that in the first Test already and we believe he can keep repeating that because he is a very keen learner, he is a very sharp guy and he understands situations really well.
Kohli said Shaw, 21-year-old wicketkeeper batsman Rishabh Pant and batsman Hanuma Vihari, 24, had learned to handle the stress of top competition by playing in the Indian Premier League.
BIG STAGE VETERANS
One always feels that pressure when you wear your countrys cap on the morning of the match but yes, I think its not as intense as say 10-15 years back when you didnt have any exposure to this kind of cricket, said Kohli.
They have played in situations like the IPL where they have played in front of so many people that they are not nervous any more of the big stage, he added.
They are not overawed by the scenario and I think thats always going to be an advantage because the guys can be fearless and they can start doing the job from game one.
Shaws 2013 schoolboy exploits had already caused comparisons to be made with Tendulkar, who rose to prominence in the same Harris Shield competition more than two decades earlier.
Shaw went on to make more headlines in India with debut centuries in both the domestic Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy and he was awarded the captaincy of countrys Under-19 team.
He led them to success in the Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand this year where they beat Australia in the final.
He has featured for Delhi Daredevils in the 2018 IPL but it was his debut Test ton, with 19 boundaries, that saw the rest of the cricket world take notice.
Wow, carry on young man good luck, wrote former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar on Twitter.
Former England captain Michael Vaughan tweeted: Wow... 18 yrs old @PrithviShaw. 100 on Test debut .. Looks like #India have another superstar.  AFP

Lanka could complement Dubai, Singapore - LKI
Sri Lanka with its strategic location has the ability of developing into a regional trading and logistics hub to complement Dubai and Singapore, a study on the Indian Ocean Economy done by Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute (LKI) revealed.
Whether this is achieved depends partly on how well Sri Lanka integrates with the vibrant Indian Ocean economy, the study states.
The study aligns with LKIs mandate of conducting independent research on Sri Lankas international relations, strategic interests and economic development.
By highlighting the Indian Ocean as the next best economic thing amid an uncertain global environment, this LKI study highlights its contribution to research and knowledge sharing in Sri Lanka and beyond.
The world is currently undergoing major economic and geopolitical transformations. While economic power continues to shift from the West to the East, rising populism and escalating geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea pose risks. These risks are being compounded by rising oil prices, capital outflows and a simmering economic crisis in emerging markets.
Meanwhile, the Indian Ocean - a crucial artery of global maritime energy and goods trade - seems below the radar. When considered as a single unit, the 28 economies touching the Indian Ocean across South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, and Africa and the Middle-East can play a role in fostering global prosperity and peace in a new world order.
The study highlights that the Indian Ocean economy has a rich natural resource base and strategically vital sea-lanes that provide conducive initial conditions for trade-led growth.
The study also states that the current trade-related trends in the region are positive, demonstrating an increase in shipping, trade flows and FDI. The regions economy is projected to continue to grow and trade much faster than the world economy. But development gaps between regional economies and inequality remain challenging.
Sustaining the regions performance requires, among others, investing in port development and customs modernisation, gradually reducing barriers to trade in goods, services trade and investment and putting in place trade adjustment programmes, setting up an Indian Ocean Development Fund to address development gaps between economies, and strengthening regional economic institutions like the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) and consolidating bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) into a region-wide FTA.
LKI is a think tank that analyses Sri Lankas international relations and strategic interests, to provide insights and recommendations that advance justice, peace, prosperity, and sustainability.

Lend a helping paw
Many dogs show empathy if their owner is in distress and will also try to help rescue them. This is according to Emily M. Sanford, formerly of Macalester College and now at Johns Hopkins University in the US. She is the lead author of a study in Springers journal Learning & Behavior that tested whether there is truth in the notion that dogs have a prosocial and empathetic nature. Interesting to note, the study found that dogs specially trained for visitations as therapy dogs are just as likely to help as other dogs.
In one of their experiments, Sanford and her colleagues instructed the owners of 34 dogs to either give distressed cries or to hum while sitting behind a see-through closed door. Sixteen of these dogs were registered therapy dogs.
Reactions
The researchers watched what the dogs did, and also measured their heart rate variability to see how they physically reacted to the situation. In another part of the experiment, the researchers examined how these same dogs gazed at their owners to measure the strength of their relationship.
Dogs that heard distress calls were no more likely to open a door than dogs that heard someone humming. However, they opened the door much faster if their owner was crying. Based on their physiological and behavioral responses, dogs who opened the door were, in fact, less stressed than they were during baseline measurements, indicating that those who could suppress their own distress were the ones who could jump into action.
Canine empathy
The study therefore provides evidence that dogs not only feel empathy towards people, but in some cases also act on this empathy. This happens especially when they are able to suppress their own feelings of distress and can focus on those of the human involved.
According to Sanford, this is similar to what is seen when children need to help others. They are only able to do so when they can suppress their own feelings of personal distress.
It appears that adopting anothers emotional state through emotional contagion alone is not sufficient to motivate an empathetic helping response; otherwise, the most stressed dogs could have also opened the door, explains co-author Julia Meyers-Manor of Ripon College in the US.
The extent of this empathetic response and under what conditions it can be elicited deserve further investigation, especially as it can improve our understanding of the shared evolutionary history of humans and dogs.
Contrary to expectation, the sixteen therapy dogs in the study performed as well as the other dogs when tested on opening the door.
According to Meyers-Manor this may be because registered therapy dogs, despite what people may think, do not possess traits that make them more attentive or responsive to human emotional states. She says that therapy dog certification tests involve skills based more on obedience rather than on human-animal bonding.
It might be beneficial for therapy organizations to consider more traits important for therapeutic improvement, such as empathy, in their testing protocols, adds Meyers-Manor. It would also be interesting to determine whether service dogs show a different pattern of results given their extensive training in attentiveness to their human companions.

Mihin Lanka gobbled Rs. 14.5 bn from Treasury - Official
The Treasury had infused Rs.14.5 billion in public funds to the loss making airline, Mihin Lanka. This entire amount was unproductive until the company was liquidated in 2015, it was revealed before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on Sri Lankan Airlines, Sri Lankan Catering and Mihin Lanka yesterday.
Most of this money had been spent to pay outstanding dues by the company instead of managing them properly for the business to be a profitable entity, Balasooriya said.
Treasury's Public Enterprises (DPE) Department Director Champa Balasooriya testified before the commission for the second consecutive day yesterday.
State Counsel Sajith Bandara leading evidence said that these kinds of expenditures by the state caused heavy burden on the public resulting in paying high tax rates and obtaining foreign loans.
In 2009, Rs. 158 million was released by the Treasury to Mihin to settle loans obtained from LOLC Company, that had been used for security deposits of aircraft without permission from the Treasury.
The Treasury on a request made by then CEO of the company had released another Rs. 157 million to settlle outstanding dues for LOLC in 2010. However, the total amount of budgetary allocation for 2010 for Mihin Lanka was Rs. 1.68 billion.
In 2011, Rs. 300 million with the interest of Rs. 106 million was paid through a supplementary allocation from the budget for loans obtained from Airport and Aviations Services. In the following year, the Treasury had issued Rs. 507 million to the company as per their request. In 2013, the capital infusion to the company by the Treasury was Rs. 1.894 billion. However, for the final year, 2014, the amount of capital infused to the company by the Treasury was Rs. 6.528 billion. This final amount of Rs.14. 5 bllion is exclusive of the Treasury Guarantees and Comfort Letters issued by the Treasury.

Bread and potatoes are staple food in Slovenia and dishes are often simple and hearty.
The Njoki is a dish which consists of potato dumplings dipped in truffle cream. The truffle cream adds a unique essence to the dish as truffle harvesting is a significant pass-time of many Slovene folk. Served mainly during lunch, the dish is often complemented by a fine wine or beer.

Money caused crickets  downfall - Arjuna
Former Test cricket captain, Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said that the main reason for cricket's disastrous downfall is money.
He made this statement at the second day opening ceremony of the XBAN 2018 Exhibition at the Bandaranayake College, Gampaha yesterday (11).
"It was a great pride for our hearts to represent the school cricket team or National team. Especially when representing the National team we felt that pride. We are the representatives of country's 20 million people. It was a great honor for us. That honor was never betrayed for money. But what happened today There is a culture of going behind money today. It is in our society too. Now we need to see how we can get rid of this. In the past few days, we heard some sad news about cricket. Why did cricket fall into such a state The main reason for this is that the SLC and some players are going behind money. Now, the time has come to change this situation. We are not too late...," Minister Ranatunga said. Speaking further, Minister said that the main reason for the current situation is forgetting the loyalty to country.
"Our teachers used a rod to punish us to make a good person. Therefore, I am not against the use of a rod to punish students. In the past there were no Human Rights activities like today. When teacher punish a student he goes to the police station. We have also destroyed our culture through this. Actually, the biggest obstacle that we are facing today is forgetting our identity. We cannot go forward forgetting our identity," Minister further said.

From one of the worlds smelliest fruits to three-penis wine, a new museum in Sweden promises to showcase 80 of the worlds most disgusting foods.
But far from trying to gross-out visitors, Malmos aptly-named Disgusting Food Museum is on a mission to challenge peoples basic assumptions about food and test the theory that disgust is cultural and contextual.
I was thinking about how interesting it would be to dedicate a museum not to the most beautiful or tastiest food, but to the worlds most disgusting food, museum curator and chief disgustologist Samuel West told Lonely Planet. We hope that the museum can contribute a growing interest and acceptance of more ecologically sustainable protein sources, such as insects.
Even though Hkarl (well-aged shark from Iceland) might sound gross, why not give it a taste Or be adventurous and try the famously stinky Durian fruit. The museum opens on October 29.

Never tattoo late!
A rebellious 77-year-old great-grandmother has spent 2,000 on 16 tattoos covering her body since her husband died  including a tribute to him.
Glenys the Menace Coope, 77, saves up the money from her pension so she can afford to get a new tattoo every few months.
The widowed gran-of-five and great gran-of-three got her first set of tattoos back in the 1960s but later had them removed by plastic surgery because her husband Walter disapproved. But since his death in 2014, the retired housewife and mum-of-two has begun to re-explore her love of body art and now has dozens of tattoos  including inkings of an alien vampire and Medusa  on her arms, chest and back.
She said, Im not an ordinary old age pensioner. I get one every couple of months. Ive spent 2,000 but its been worth every penny. I save up because Im a pensioner so when Ive got enough money I go and get one done. I like them so Ill get a few more but I wont have loads. I want a werewolf on my back and then Ill leave it for a little bit.
Glenys got her first of tattoos  two hearts on her neck, a beauty spot on her face, two swallows on her hands and a devil and rose on her back  in 1964. But she said husband Walter didnt like them, so she underwent plastic surgery to remove them in 1985.
The couple were married for 54 years before Walter passed away in 2014.
It was soon after that Glenys decided to get a tattoo to cope with her grief, and she now has a love heart with his name tattooed on her chest. And she said despite her age, she isnt interested in what people think about her tattoos.
Glenys said, After he died I felt that this was something I wanted to do for myself. People dont say anything. They just look at me. The occasional person doesnt like them but everybody else is fine. People stop in town and want to take photos of them. At the end of the day to be quite honest I dont give a toss.
Glenys visits a local tattoo parlour in Derby, Octopus Tattoo Studio, run by artist Gerry Carnelly, to have all her inkings done. Glenys says that shed encourage any older person considering getting a tattoo to have one. And she said her grandchildren and great-grandchildren love the designs covering her body.
She said, Id tell anyone thinking about getting one to go ahead and get one. It doesnt matter what other people think. Im proud of them and I like them. Theyre very nice. My tattooist Gerry is very friendly and theyre a lovely lot at the tattoo parlour. Im always looking at people whove got tattoos. I find it fascinating. My grandchildren and great-grandchildren think theyre alright, after all, its just a painting on the arms isnt. If I could get anything I think Id have a forest with a werewolf on my leg and a werewolf on my other leg. You name it, Ill do it. Im living life to its limits. I wont let my age put me down.
According to Glenyss sister, Pearl, her sister is tough and no-nonsense. And Pearl, 84, was been inspired to get her own inking of a bee on her leg two years ago after watching Glenys love affair with inkings develop.
She said, Shes always been a menace.Not to me though, I love her to bits. I love her tattoos. Ive got one little one because Im not as brave as she is. As she says, its her body and she can do what she likes.

Parliament
Country is moving forward
We have to think of national policies along one line irrespective of the party we work for. Exports have increased to $17 billion under this government. The country is now moving forward slowly but steadily, Roads and Road Development Minister Kabir Hashim said in Parliament yesterday. He was speaking on the export sector when two regulations were taken up.
We introduced the open market policy in 1977 under former President J.R. Jayewardene and his was called an era of trade liberalisation. By 1993, we revised the countrys duty structure and formed a three-band tariff structure as 10 per cent, 20 per cent and 35 per cent to simplify it. In 1994, the government changed under President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and thereafter under Mahinda Rajapaksa. At that time, they criticised the UNPs effort. They promised to abolish the Executive Presidency and rip the J.R. Jayewardenes 1978 Constitution and also pledged to do away with our economic policies and introduce a new economic policy. They gave the country great hope.
Unfortunately, none of these pledges were fulfilled. From 1994 to 2014, thanks to the UNP, the country has the same economic and social structure, he said. But it went from bad to worse because there was no proper economic policy, he said.
He said those who talk so much about patriotism and sense of national pride should first have a clear policy. If there is a clear policy anything could be done within its scope. As a small country, we need to identify our agenda. From 1995 to 2001, the average commodity tariff had reduced by 50 per cent. The overall tarrif at 20 per cent was reduced to 9.4 per cent during the UPFA government. The effective rate of protection, which protects local businesses was at 70 per cent in 1994, had reduced to 56 per cent by 2001, he said.
Minister Hashim said persons who are sitting in the opposition and talking about protecting domestic production should look back on how had they acted while they were in power.
Then during the Mahinda Rajapaksas era after 2005 to 2014, the tariff at 70 per cent had reduced to 63 per cent clearly indicating that by discarding the open economic policy, the previous government had done more damage to the domestic industry. They very cleverly allowed their family members and friends to import whatever they wanted by exempting them from all tarrifes.
At one point they imported ethanol and at another they imported dog food. This is how they governed this country during their time without any proper policy. This lack of proper policy affected out local production and industry, the Minister said.
We trusted the open economic and the open market policies. If benefits are to be derived, we need to follow a certain economic policy. Although we took certain decisions, we always made sure they were tailored to suit our country, he said.
He said the post war growth was very impressive, but just for a year or two and fter the war ended in 2009, it was an ideal opportunity to change this country.
Up until 2012, our development rate improved. By 2010, there was an 8 per cent economic growth and by 2012 it dropped to 6.4 per cent and by 2013-14 it had further dropped to 4 per cent. That was mainly because we did not have a definite production base. There were two areas for growth post war - one was construction and the other was services. These areas are import based and has no benefit for domestic production, he said.
IGP implemented NPC recommendations - Speaker
The implementation of the recommendations of the National Police Commission have been duly completed by the Inspector General of Police (IGP) within the given two weeks, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
The Speaker was responding yesterday to queries raised by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
The Speaker summoned IGP Pujith Jayasundara and the National Police Commission members for a special meeting of the Constitutional Council (CC) on September 7. During the meeting, the IGP was instructed to report to the CC within 14 days on the progress of the implementation of the recommendations of the Police Commission. MP Gunawardena alleged that the Police Commissions recommendations were not implemented. I would like to correct him that all the recommendations were duly implemented now. The IGP and the Police Commission reported this to me, the Speaker said.
Heated argument over CC appointments
A heated argument erupted in Parliament yesterday over the criteria followed in making appointments to the high rank positions and independent commissions by the Constitutional Council (CC).
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, after listening to the opinions of the Government and Opposition members, said he would initiate a discussion to come to an agreement on rectifying loopholes of the CC and independent commissions.
Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said Parliament should make a policy decision on the composition of the independent commissions and said he personally believe that those commissions must not comprise retired persons.
We have not formulated a set of basic criteria that must be adhered to when making appointments. We have responsibility to come up with such a set of criteria with the consent of all in the House.
The members appointed to independent commissions are mostly retired persons. The appointed persons must have a sense of duty.
I am of the opinion that there is no point in appointing retired persons to some commissions as we do not get the expected service from them.
Those who are in the public service must be appointed to the commissions. They can be police officers, officers in the Attorney Generals Department, officers in the judicial service or civil administrative officers. They are bound by the Establishment Code and receive punishment if they do any wrong. The Judicial Service Commission functions very well because it comprises judges who are serving now. Though we appoint pensioners thinking that they are independent, they are accountable to none. Let us take a policy decision in the future on the composition of commissions, especially the Police Commission, he said.
The Joint Opposition agreeing with Dr. Rajapakshe thanked him for his views.
There is no set of guidelines for the CC to be followed when recommending persons to independent commissions and high rank positions.
Under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, we did not approve this kind of conduct of the CC. The confidence on the CC has been lost due to the conduct of certain individuals appointed by the CC,JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the CC functions independently today and it has the power to even reject the name proposed by the President for any high rank position.
When the appointments were discussed at the Party Leaders Meeting on Wednesday, MP Gunawardena did not object. It is against the Parliament tradition to go against them now. During the period of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, all the appointments to high rank positions were directly made by him and he got such powers by way of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution.
The President does not have such arbitrary powers now. Those who shout today over the appointments of the CC were under the iron feet of the then President. We liberated them, he said.
Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said Parliament should collectively accept the responsibility for any shortcoming on the part of the CC.
We passed the 19th Amendment to the Constitution to fulfill the peoples aspirations for democracy. We were grateful that all the parties supported it despite that there was a minority Government.
We accept that there can be loopholes and that not all decisions made by the CC were proven to be correct. We can sort them out at a party leaders meeting.
Let us approve the names of three civil society members collectively as the matters now we discuss are not related to those members.
Otherwise those distinguished individuals may not accept those appointments. We are not undermining your views on the CC. Let us discuss and resolve them, he said.
Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera and MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said that there is no way Parliament can oversee the work of the independent commissions. While saying that those commissions are independent, we must also clearly state as to how they become accountable to Parliament, Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera noted.
UPFA MP Dayasiri Jayasekara raised concerns that Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala serving in the CC amounts to a conflict of interest as the CC decides on the appointments of the Chief Justice and superior court judges.
The Speaker rejected that argument stating that Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe served in the CC while he was holding the Justice Ministerial portfolio.
Minister Rajapakshe too rejected the argument stating that the ministerial portfolio one holds is irrelevant to the role he or she plays in the CC.
New CC meets today
The newly appointed Constitutional Council (CC) will conduct its first meeting at 12pm today at the Parliament complex to discuss the appointment of new Chief Justice, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
Parliament yesterday approved former Sri Lankan diplomat Dr. Jayantha Danapala, Attorney-at-Law Ahmad Javid Yusuf and Colombo University Law Faculty Senior Lecturer Naganathan Selvakkumaran as the three civil society representatives of the CC.
Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala and former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa were appointed to the CC with the agreement between the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader.
JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake was appointed as the minor party representative who is due from a political party outside of the parties to which the PM and the Opposition Leader belong (UNP and TNA). Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe was appointed as the Presidents representative to the CC.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya (Chairman), Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Opposition Leader R Sampanthan are ex-officio members of the CC.
Speaker Jayasuriya said the appointment letters to all the new members of the CC would be issued within yesterday.
The CC will meet today to decide on the successor to Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, who is to retire today. The 10-member CC is the apex decision making body that recommends the appointments to the Independent Commissions and high ranking positions such as the Attorney General, Auditor General, Parliament Secretary General, IGP, Chief Justice and superior court judges etc.
Adverse weather affects over 69,583 persons
Over 69,583 persons in 17,303 families have been affected with the adverse weather. Twelve persons have died, while 18 persons had sustained injuries, Irrigation and Water Resources and Disaster Management State Minister Palitha Range Bandara said in Parliament yesterday.
Rs.100,000 is paid as compensation for adeath and cooked foods and other essential items is distributed using funds released to the District Secretaries.
An advance of Rs.10,000 is paid per family to repair their damaged houses under a part of the insurance scheme. A damage assessment committee was appointed to look into the damage and Rs. 2.5 million will be paid per a damaged house.
Small and medium scale businesses with a turnover of less than Rs.10 million will receive Rs.2.5 million for damaged stocks and Rs.100,000 for machines damaged. These are the ceilings set for compensation,  he said.
The Minister said that several reservoirs are under construction in key river basins to retain flood waters for agriculture.
He said the government commenced building reservoirs and dams in key river valleys as a long term measure to control the floods. The water collected from each of these irrigation projects will be channeled to dry zones for agriculture and other purposes, he said.
A key study was carried out on the Kelani River and discussions were held with the Japanese government for a project.
We will use the expert knowledge and recommendations from local and foreign experts. The Malwathu Oya project, the third largest reservoir project in the country, will be set up in Thanthirimale, the Minister said.
He cautioned that the average temperature is projected to increase by 2 degrees by 2020 and longer and more frequent droughts and high winds will hit the country. That will result in a water scarcity in 2050, he said.
All sectors must unite to eradicate drug menace - Gayantha
Over 4,399 kg and 967 grams of Kerala cannabis, 1,631 kg and 747 grams of heroin, and 1,913 kg and 175 grams of cocaine were seized from 2010 to 2018, Lands and Parliamentary Reforms and Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunatileka said.
He was responding to JVP-MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa in Parliament yesterday.
Minister Karunatileka said 202,777 persons were arrested for drug offences. He said the drug menace has escalated to new levels calling on all sectors of society to pitch in the effort to eradicate the drug scourge from the country.
He said the seized narcotics is sent to the Government Analyst for analysis and confirmation.
Based on the report of the Government Analyst, legal action is initiated and the narcotics are destroyed under the observation of a Magistrate. In addition to the 202,777 arrests of locals, we have arrested 230 foreigners for involving in Kerala cannabis, heroin, and cocaine deals, the Minister said.
JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, while commending the government for efforts taken so far to curb the drug menace, called on the government to intensify the drug operations. He said Sri Lanka has gained reputation as a regional narcotics hub. He warned that it has been in society for some time to the extent that drugs are circulated among schoolchildren as well.
Minister Karunatillaka said the issue is serious and assured a detailed response on measures taken at another date.
Ananthan and Sumanthiran lock horns
TNA MPs Sivasakthy Ananthan and M. A. Sumanthiran clashed in Parliament yesterday over a privilege issue raised by the former over depriving him of his chance to speak.
The Joint Opposition (JO) too tangled with MP Sumanthiran over the same issue. JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said the JO will allocate time for MP Ananthan if the TNA continues to deprive him of the chance to speak in Parliament.
MP Ananthan complained that he was not given chance to speak in Parliament for the past 10 months despite his repeated requests. He said the Opposition Leader deliberately blocks his freedom of expression by not allocating time for him. He said his fundamental rights and Parliamentary privileges were breached.
I have complained the matter to the Speaker in writing about three times. I have personally met him and requested his intervention. So far he had not taken necessary steps to resolve the problem. There are ample instances in the past where MPs who decided to be independent were given time to speak. I request to allocate time to me at least during the upcoming budget debate, he said.
TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran, replying to MP Ananthan in the absence of Opposition Leader R Sampanthan, said the MP will not be allocated time from the ITAK (TNA) until he abides by the party decisions.
If a member functions independently, that member must have the right to speak in Parliament.
If he declared himself as an independent MP, then the Speaker can allocate him time.
That has been the tradition. As long as he remains a member of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi (ITAK), he must obey it. If not, he will not be allocated any time.
I say this on behalf of all the members of the ITAK, he said.
Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri said he would bring this matter to the notice of the Speaker.
JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena speaking in support of MP Ananthan said that there were previous instances that MPs right to speech were recognised in the House at times their parties refused to give them time.
Crisis at Rajarata University Medical Faculty
Ministries in talks to resolve issue
The Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Ministry is in talks with the Finance and Mass Media Ministry to find a solution to the crisis at the Rajarata University Medical Faculty.
The crisis has resulted in the staff of the faculty resigning from their posts in protest of withholding their monthly retention allowance, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said in Parliament yesterday.
He was responding to a question by Chief Opposition Whip and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Leader Anura Kumar Dissanayake. Rajapakshe said that neither the Higher Education Ministry nor the University Grants Commission (UGC) had any hand in the decision of withholding the retention allowance. He said it was not easy to find lecturers and professors for rural universities without offering them some benefits.
A retention allowance was introduced as an incentive for these lecturers and professors. It is not a decision made by the Ministry or the UGC, but the Senate Council and the Vice Chancellor of the Rajarata University made the decision. A professor at the Medical Faculty was paid Rs. 100,000 per month.
A Senior Lecturer and other lecturers were paid Rs. 80,000 and 50,000 monthly retention allowance respectively, he said.
When the university authorities were summoned before the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) on March 21, they were reprimanded for payment of this allowance as it does not comply with State monetary regulations. Even the National Audit Commission (NAC) criticised the paying of this allowance to the lecturers by the university authorities.
Thereafter, the Finance Ministry issued a circular on July18 banning the payment of allowances not approved by the Treasury. The Senate Council of the University withheld the retention allowance for lecturers of the Medical Faculty, Rajapakshe said.
He said that his ministry and he had no hand in this decision. .
Ekanayake makes jumbo proposal
MP and former Minister T. B. Ekanayake proposed to gift elephants to foreign countries to resolve the human-elephant conflict.
The MP, in the SLFP Group of 15, yesterday in Parliament said the President and the Prime Minister could gift elephants to foreign State leaders instead of gifting them wooden or glass ornaments of elephants.
The MP said the North Korean leader recently gifted two puppies to the South Korean leader as a gesture of goodwill.
The aggravated human-elephant conflict is a serious problem in the dry zone. About 8,000 wild elephants encroach villages in the dry zones. We can docile them and send to other countries as gifts, the former minister said.
Expert panel report to CA on Nov. 9
The Steering Committee yesterday decided to present the Expert Panel report that contains a draft of the new Constitution to the Constitutional Assembly on November 9.
The Tamil and English translations of the report had been extensively discussed at the meeting yesterday and several Steering Committee members have requested time to study and compare the translated copies of the report.
Several members have raised questions whether the term Orumiththa Nadu means exactly the same as Aekiya Raajya, sources said. There were discussions whether it is the correct translation. Various views were expressed but there was no final decision, the Committee sources said.

The Perfect Sunset
Juliet Coombe has for decades been fascinated by Passikudah and its famous golden bay with one of the longest stretches of shallow coastlines in the world, where she could imagine the famous Beatles lyrics Here comes the sun being played by Wester Felthman the musical General Manager of Sunrise by Jetwing, as the sun rises each day out of the ocean like a giant golden ball.
Arriving at Sunrise by Jetwing as the sun sets or rises is truly spectacular, and the hotel from the moment you enter it is a rock star moment as you discover the magnificent architecture and central location to one of the worlds most idyllic bays. At the end of the beach you can see large smooth rocks that look like gigantic turtles with their heads buried in the sand or out to sea where the perfectly white hull of a fifty foot yacht intermittently reflects the rays of the sun. From peaceful places like Sunrise by Jetwing, you can reconnect with your inner sanctum and settle down from the chaos of the rush to get everything done before the well-earned break from it all.
It has a kind of Harry Potter magic with beautiful multi coloured lights creatively arranged around the hotel and its magnificent 108 metre infinity pool, emanate a tropical mystique and romance that is woven throughout the well appointed bedrooms and places to dine or enjoy a Spa treatment or two. Curling up in the gorgeous bedding of a spacious, spotless, well designed room with swirling artworks and whicker lighting, evokes a deep sense of contentment not felt for some time past, like an old friend rediscovered, which allows old memories to resurface and the soul to fully recharge.
Waking from a night of deep sleep and occasional jet lagged visits to the sustainably appointed bathroom, the morning brings the glory of this well named enigmatic jewel, one of the many gems in the Jetwing management crown, with the sun rising out of the horizon of the Indian Ocean and above the vast infinity pool, to bathe Passikudah beach and bay in another delightful dawning spread of Turner colours. Open ones door to marvel at natures marine beauty while mulling over whether to start the day with some yoga, a swim or take pictures of this breathtaking site.
Most guests love to start the morning slowly enjoying the tasty buffet breakfast fit for kings which is served from 7am by the most attentive and lovely Jetwing staff, with seafood cooked straight from the oceans morning offering in the local curry dish selection. The mix of healthy and sweet treats sets one up for the day, and for some this is basking in the sun, dipping in and out of the great pool, getting ones fix of calciferols, or set off down the grass-lined paths to sit amongst the oasis-like trees beside the sea on soft white sands, to serenely gaze across calm shallow waters that shimmer like a million stars above coral clusters and a stunning coral reef, one of the best known in the East and proposed as a Marine Sanctuary by NARA.
Like all Jetwing managed properties, the staff is mostly employed from the area and is trained to be passionate about their jobs and what to do in the surrounding area. The somehow make you feel like you are part of a family, and the food so delicious that it truly captures the voodoo of the location. Across all the Jetwing properties there has been a serious drive to become fully sustainable provision, using solar, water recycling, organic food production and local sourcing such as the use of banana leaves and paper straws for serving food and drink, amongst a host of other initiatives. The architecture of the building maintains order but has diverse spaces arranged over different levels and the zenith is reached with the vaulted ceiling that rests on towering pillars with sparkling lights over one end of the pool and the dining area. Groups of whicker lanterns appear to float across the waters of the pool like giant babes in swaddling clothes, wafting past, stopping only to observe the exquisite feasts on the poolside tables below them that tantalise taste buds and delight the eyes.
When your mind and soul have relaxed enough and you have put your world to rights, then there are plenty of things to do around the hotel, including village walks, bike rides, beach nature experiences, volley, table tennis, pool, windsurfing, jet skiing and waterskiing further down the beach, and scuba diving, the last of which you can take an excellent PADI course to get certified. There is also the Coconut Cultural Park just over five minute walk away where you can get some delicious ice cream, amongst other things. Or you can venture south down the coast to Batticaloa to hear the singing fish, and see the Batticaloa Gate, Gandhi Park, Kallady Bridge, the Batticaloa Lighthouse, the Mamangam Hindu Temple, the Sinna Uppodai Lagoon and the Old Dutch Fort. Or you can venture up north along the coast to Trincomalees Rock Temple with its amazing heady heights view of the ocean where you can make a wish by tying a piece of material to a sacred tree or walk down to the market where deer amble about, left over from colonial times.
Then, if you have had your fill of sun, sand and sea, you can go inland to Polonorruwa, on a cultural extravaganza, to learn about the incredible history of the Second Kingdom and discover how advanced their medicinal skills were on a bike ride through the old city ruins, which includes the remains of the original hospital where they bathed people in a huge herbal bath to cure snakebites in ancient times. It also has legendary, still active hydraulic irrigation systems and enormous tanks, which have inspired Jetwings own use of water and recycling programme.
Then there are the wonderful wildlife reserves and cultural national parks: Somawathiya - a truly beautiful national park with an abundance of religious sites both ancient and current, food markets that are an orgy of bright and diverse colours with elephants and peacocks wondering around happily. Maduru Oya is another amazing protected wildlife reserve with a well developed series of water systems and architecture going back many centuries.

Railway, Wildlife officials begin prevention mission
A team of 14 officials of the Railway Department and Wildlife Conversation Department are observing elephant transit points along the Northern and Eastern railway lines to make recommendations for preventing elephanttrain collisions.
This is one of the proposals suggested by the special committee appointed by Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva for formulating an immediate plan to avoid more elephanttrain collisions.
Minister De Silva said once these officers give their observations, a comprehensive plan will be formulated to resolve this issue.
These officials will be observing elephant transit points along the North and East railway lines starting from Mahawa Railway Station, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Anuradhapura, Thalaimannar and Kankasanthurai from October 11-14.
A committee of intellectuals and academics will formulate a comprehensive plan to resolve this issue within five days, once the officials come back with their observations.
The final committee report, plan and financial estimate for the implementation of the recommendations will be handed over to Minister De Silva on October 25.
The Minister expects to obtain Cabinet approval for the plan to be able to implement it before the end of this year.
He said around 12 elephants had died within very short period due to elephanttrain collisions. This is a national crime and it is our duty to help conserve wildlife, he said.

## Title: Sri Lankas contribution to the Indian Ocean

Sri Lankas contribution to the Indian Ocean
Sri Lanka is strategically located as an important island in the heart of the Indian Ocean with a land area of nearly 65,610 sq. kms and having sea base of over four times its land mass. Since, history the country has been in the middle of international attention as a crucial destination between the East and West shipping routes that attracted three maritime superpowers trading in that route for economic benefits to the said motherlands. They not only conducted trading, but also introduced their legal systems by making this island a mixed law State, which is quite rare in the international legal spheres.
This has hugely benefitted the legal community of the country by being competent in both the common law and civil law systems. Although, the country is claiming to be a maritime hub in the present international economic order, it has been holding such unique feature for time immemorial. The historic ports of Mahatitthaon the Arabian Sea, Gokanna now known as Trincomalee, Jambukolapatuna and Urathurai of the Northern peninsula, Pallawawanka in the East, and Kalanbu now called Colombo are classic examples of where maritime activities thus existed. Later, the addition of Galle and few other ports made Sri Lanka secure a prominence in the shipping trade providing many options for directing respective journeys in and out of the sea in a strategically significant island nation. Despite the fact that Chinese attention has been drawn towards the country with many investments coming down the line especially under the Belt and Road Initiative, the country was used as a key location in ancient Chinas Maritime Silk Route during its Sung Dynasty (1127-1278).
The present system of governance has given much priority for the development of Sri Lankan ports especially, the three key facilities, namely Colombo, Hambanthota, and Galle; to make them economic centres in the countrys move towards achieving prosperity. The importance of convening the Indian Ocean Conference hosted by the Prime Minister on October 11 and 12, 2018 falls at this very important juncture where the country is seeking to link with all the littoral States bordering the Indian Ocean.
Alliance with Members States of UNCLOS
While the sailing community take on to one of the busiest maritime routes in terms of container, oil, gasoline, and bulk trades along the Western to Southern and then to the Eastern regions and vice versa, the legal domain in protecting the sea areas of the country as well as other maritime interests involved with the ocean are well commendable. But however, as a nation, we are still unable to appreciate the developments taking place at international level within our legal system as a whole. That is to say, Sri Lanka has yet to legislate number of key important international instruments applying in the maritime sector within the norms of a dualistic legal domain, being a member of the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, the contribution of its law towards meeting most of the ends of globally operating standards is highly appreciable.
It is a well-known fact that the private maritime laws developed much prior to the entering into force of the so-called Constitution of the Oceans: the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea, 1982. Even before the worlds order on the seas was attempted to be drafted under the auspices of the 1st United Nations Conference on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1956, private maritime laws of some varying degrees of concern originated due to the importance of protecting the seas as well as to safeguard the maritime interests therein. But however, the immense contribution of an eminent Sri Lankan lawyer late Shirley Amarasinghe who took the leadership of the 3rd UNCLOS brought into limelight the present international codified law as the umbrella convention in the world order of activities relating to sea and maritime affairs. Due to the unwanted delays that took place in adopting the UNCLOS official document, which is the Law of the Sea Convention in 1982 signed in Montego Bay, Sri Lanka went single handedly in legislating its own piece of legislation that determined the areas that come under the national sovereignty of land territory and other jurisdictional matters associated with its maritime waters.
The Marine Zones Law No. 22/1976 plays some significant role in the determination of the countrys claim to its territorial sea, contiguous zone, exclusive economic zone, and the continental shelf. The particular law has also become subject to the two Indo-Lanka Agreements on the Boundary in Historic Waters between the Two Countries and Related Matters (1974) and on the Maritime Boundary between the Two Countries in the Gulf of Mannar and the Bay of Bengal and Related Matters (1976).
These two Agreements have touched upon some key aspects of the law of the sea as long as historic waters are concerned parallel to the arguments brought about in the South China Sea dispute, and the delimitation of sea areas dealt in respect of the varying national sea regimes prevailing under the UNCLOS. Having ratified the Law of the Sea Convention in 1994 alongside the coming into force of this much important international legal regime on the seas and oceans, Sri Lanka is presently playing a huge role as a strategic partner of the Indian Ocean Rim. It is noteworthy that Sri Lanka has claimed and acquired almost all the rights that it entails under the Convention including the recent success at the United Nations in respect of the extended claim on the continental shelf that would span to an area of forty times the size of its landmass.
Basically, the country hasnt had many disputes with its neighbours over the sea areas that fall under the sovereign or jurisdictional competence unlike number of States that usually ended up in the International Court of Justice, International Tribunal for Law of the Sea, or any other forum such as the Permanent Court of Arbitration that deals with sea related disputes.
However, the developed jurisprudence of these international courts of fame have immensely contributed to the countrys geographical location in the Indian Ocean such as the freedom of navigation inculcated through the Corfu Channel Case (1949) and the South China Sea dispute (2016), which I comprehensively dealt in a recent discussion at Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute with Prof. Atsuko Kanchara from Sophia University, Japan. In addition, the legal principles outlined in Malaysia v Singapore (2003) dispute relating to the marine environmental protection and the Mox Plant case (2001) between Ireland and United Kingwdwom are some that would have relevance to Sri Lankas concerns over the Sethu Samudram Canal project and Indias transportation of nuclear materials along the North-Western cowastal belt between the two countries.
Moving along the UNCLOS
Over the years, Sri Lanka has maintained a steady move along the main provisions of the UNCLOS by adopting several measures in line with it. It has stood on the fundamental attainments of certain organisational arrangements with member States of the region as well as on matters pertaining to marine resources and costal controls. These are some important measures that need to be achieved in a countrys efforts to manage coastal zones. In respect of regional cooperation and connected arrangements, Sri Lanka has become a key player in almost all regional organisations respecting the obligations highlighted by the UNCLOS in view of its Articles 118, 129, Section II of Part XII in matters dealing with Conservation and Management of the Living Resources of the High Seas, Cooperation in the Construction and Improvement of Means of Transport, Global and Regional Cooperation of Protection and Preservation of Marine Environment, and of Port State Control respectively, where it holds the membership in these regional organisations in particular such as the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, Indian Ocean Memorandum of Understanding in Port State Control, and the like.
In addition to the organisational means that it actively participates, Sri Lanka has also contributed single-handedly in relation to matters of high importance that stems out of the UNCLOS such as the concepts of freedom of navigation, maintaining safety of navigation, provisioning the navigational support, rendering of assistance at times of distress for international shipping, prohibition of trans-boundary pollution, and ensuring maritime security against acts of piracy and of terrorism.
Within the public law domain, Sri Lanka has enacted some important pieces of legislations in several key areas of competence in line with the rights and duties granted for coastal States by UNCLOS. Those include the Marine Pollution Prevention (MPPA) Act No. 35/2008 which replaced the older version No. 59/1981 that has also established the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) which was set up through the NARA Act No. 54/1981, the Coast Conservation Act No. 57/1981, Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance No. 2/1937 and subsequent amendments to it that deals with the protection of Cetaceans and other marine life under the Ministry of Wildlife, Petroleum Resources Act No. 26/2003 that attends to the matters relating to exploration of oil and gas in the Sri Lankan waters, Piracy Act No. 9/2001, Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation Act No. 42/2000 and the like.
(a) Marine Environment
Understanding the importance of protecting the marine environment and especially to execute the due obligation vested upon the country by the UNCLOS, Sri Lanka has set up a specialized agency under the Ministry of Environment commonly known as MEPA. Its governing legislation has made proviso in respect of matters that superfluously cover the entire maritime domain up to the Pollution Prevention Zone that extends to 200 nautical miles seawards as well as a 3 km radius inward. It has also laid the emphasis on conducting environmental impact assessments as well as the contingency plans that need to exist in a mechanism that protects the marine environment at large. In addition, it has also laid down penalty systems in wake of pollution threats by ships, pipeline and off-shore operations, anti-fouling, wrecks, ballast water sediments, land based emissions including air pollution as well as the civil liability and compensation mechanism that goes in line with the need of a proper imposition of liability against polluters under the UNCLOS. Presently, the MPPA is being reformed to include latest developments in marine pollution area such as bio-diversity issues, private maritime concerns, and pure private claims and limitation of liability regimes by a Committee of Experts, which I too have the privilege in sitting. Considering the fact that 2/3 of the worlds oil trade pass along the navigational routes of the countrys Southern coast, it is imperative for both the regulators and lawmakers to specifically concentrate on protecting the marine environment before any incident occurs, and to take prompt preventive measures in overcoming a catastrophe.
(b) Maritime Security
The country affords assistance to foreign vessels by way of institutional support that is made through Sri Lanka Navy and the Sri Lanka Coast Guards while the legal domain been sufficiently and aptly legislated with a couple of important laws such as the previously mentioned Piracy Act and the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation Act came into being in pursuance of the Convention on Suppression of Unlawful Act against the Safety of Maritime Navigation in private maritime law domain. These local legislations filled the gap that existed in relation to security concerns which came up especially aftermath the September 11 incident in the US as well as the threats inflicted by the 33 year long terrorism that existed in the country. Using the Right to Hot Pursuit that prevails in the UNCLOS gave way for Sri Lanka Navy to successfully attack and protect the countrys interests against terrorist ships prior to the ending of the war as well as protecting the navigating community of the Indian Ocean. In addition, Sri Lanka is well known for the providing of maritime security services in the region through public-private partnership under the supervision of its Ministry of Defence.
Private maritime interests
Likewise the international law on private maritime interests originated much prior to the UNLCOS, Sri Lankas membership at the International Maritime Organization goes back to the year 1972 when it commenced its journey of acceding to IMO conventions. As a leading white listed country, the international regulator of maritime activities has been aptly supported by the local counterpart, the Director General of Merchant Shipping. Understanding the importance of the role of the regulator at domestic level, the Merchant Shipping Act that provides the necessary legal back-up to this said office was implemented through Act No. 52/1971. As the local regulator, he has been granted the mandate to regulate all private maritime matters including that of flag-state control and regularizing agency related services.
In maintaining safety of navigation for foreign vessels within the local maritime zones as well as maintaining same in respect of the ships that fly the flag of Sri Lanka in international waters and in the waters of other sovereign nations, Sri Lanka has entered into the most important international conventions of the IMO as a responsible State in the Indian Ocean. These include, LOADLINES Convention 1966, TONNAGE Convention 1969, INTERVENTION Convention 1969, COLREG Convention 1972, SOLAS Convention 1972, STP Agreement 1973, Space Protocol 1973, IMSO Convention 1976, INMARSAT OA 1976, STCW Convention 1978, MARPOL Convention 1973/78 including its Annexures I, II, III, IV, and V, SUA Convention 1988, CLC Protocol 1992, FUND Protocol 1992, BUNKER Convention 2001, and BALLAST WATER Convention 2004.
In view of proposed measures that have been put forward by panel of experts including me in the maritime sector, and especially at IMOs post-audit implementation process, several new legal instruments such as the LLMC Convention 1996, HNS Protocol 2000, and ANTI FOULING Convention, LONDON DUMPING Convention, and few other have been put into the pipeline for accession.
It is noteworthy to mention somewhat slow progress in bringing these ratified conventions into the domestic legal structure within the dualistic approach of the State being a nation of the Commonwealth. This has to certain extent created some negative impact on the countrys move towards becoming a fully-fledged maritime hub at present context globally. However, many steps are been taken presently to combat this situation and provide the application of local legislations in line with international instruments. Though it may take some time until these new legislations come into being, the significant maritime feature of the country has not fallen into much of a debate nor has this led the country to arrive at unreasonable compromise in safeguarding its interests towards the Indian Ocean.
Another important contribution of Sri Lanka towards private maritime interests is the proper observance of navigational routing for maritime transport. This is an important element as long as the right of innocent passage, right of navigation, and freedom of navigation are concerned at national level. The present system of routing will be further strengthened with the commencement of the Port of Hambanthota within a commercial environment. Sri Lanka has not viewed the protection of marine resources especially with regard to living marine species that exists in a concentrated area beneath the sea where they come into conflict with navigation of ships.
Some recent concerns in relation to the whales off Mirissa have been tackled by the Ministry of Wildlife with the view of creating marine protected areas that would not disturb the much important commercial shipping without complicating rerouting processes. At a time where the proposed Kra-Canal project in Thailand to take place at a much speedier pace allowing ships to use alternate sea routes in reaching the West within short period of time, Sri Lankas ports, especially Colombo and Hambanthota will be able to secure a bigger market share. This would in turn create much attention towards the country by its neighbouring States that already depend on their shipments that go through the transhipment process in Colombo. The Port of Galle in particular will attract more Cruise vessels thus connecting the other States around the country such as India, Maldives, Bangladesh, and Myanmar falling into some important destinations in transit to those leisure makers from various countries in the world.
Blue-Economic aspirations and economic integration
Sri Lankas strategic positioning in the Indian Ocean has clearly given it the value of being a transhipment hub in particular. Out of the 7.2 million containers handled throughout the year 2017 by the Port of Colombo and the expected rate of growth at 33% this year (2018), majority of these come as transhipment cargo from the regional States such as India, Bangladesh, and other while the Indian transshipments alone consists over 75% of that figure. This has helped Sri Lanka in acquiring a bigger market share within its blue economic aspirations laid towards the Vision 2025. Being one of the biggest foreign exchange earners, the shipping industry has thrived over the years to attract big players in container handling where all the worlds leading container carriers call at the Port of Colombo. Very soon, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority will commission the work towards operating the East terminal that would employ more mussel to the presently existing SLPA owned terminal Jeya and privately owned SAGT and CICT.
Regional economic integration has also been taken care of with Sri Lankas active participation in the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). The expected economic boom in this Indian Ocean region should be viewed as an important milestone in these organisations to integrate each others economy for mutual dependency rather than of a mere self-dependency approach within the region.
However, the countrys laws should be styled to match these developments especially in attracting foreign direct investments with the opportunities been granted on the basis of ease of doing business. The extension of the land mass off Colombo known as the Colombo International Financial City formerly called the port City Project will definitely bring much more benefits not only to Sri Lanka but also to the Indian Ocean littoral States. It is no doubt that Sri Lanka is forging ahead in this area seeking to obtain consensus among its governing coalition which is an integral part of the development drive. The different sectoral developments are taking place, especially the process of implementing national policies in the areas of maritime and logistics, export strategies, and legal reform and transitional justice. These would not only promote and encourage trade in the Indian Ocean, but also enhance social integration which is considered to be a key element in a bloc like ours.
Being an island nation, Sri Lanka has much more to offer in the coming years especially towards the neighbouring States of the Indian Ocean. Providing the opportunity to freely navigate in this area of the sea would be the key to achieve these ends by all the littoral States bordering the Indian Ocean. Therefore, respecting each others commitments and the use of the Indian Ocean for their respective maritime aspirations within the economic corridor created by regional arrangements should be given priority alongside other international commitments that they have with others in different seas.

Pick only five specialist batsmen when batting has been the bane
Sri Lanka continues not to learn from past mistakes
DAMBULLA, Thursday  It is clear as day for everyone who follows cricket that Sri Lankas weakness in One-Day International (ODI) cricket lies with their batting and fielding.
The batting since the retirements of Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan has not touched the heights of that bygone era and Sri Lankas performances over the last one year or so has resulted in more defeats than wins largely due to the batsmen being unable to put up decent totals for their bowlers to defend and the drastic drop in fielding standards.
The key to winning in one-day cricket is batting and fielding. It is in these two areas that Sri Lanka excelled and was head and shoulders above everyone else when they won the World Cup in 1996. That standard was maintained throughout for the next two decades thanks largely to a surfeit of foreign coaches handling the national team.
Sri Lankas gradual decline in one-day internationals began with the departing of the last legendary batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan in August 2016  Jayawardene and Sangakkara had already quit at the end of the 2015 World Cup.
Their replacements have struggled to fill into those big boots left by the legends and that is part of the reason for the teams dip in fortunes.
Its not that Sri Lanka are bereft of talent, there is plenty of it out there, provided it is spotted and harnessed properly. Constant chopping and changing of teams from series to series has left the players unsure of themselves and where their future lies.
Sri Lanka has not had a settled batting order for almost two years and this has proved detrimental to the teams instability at international level where the word CONSISTENCY has simply disappeared.
With the World Cup barely seven months away Sri Lanka has yet not got their composition of the side right.
One has only to look at the eleven picked for the first ODI against England at Dambulla where they named only five specialist batsmen of which one of them was the wicket-keeper, knowing very well that our weakness lay in our batting. Thankfully the game did not go the full distance as rain allowed only 15 overs.
The head coach who is also a selector went to great pains to explain the dropping of Angelo Mathews by revealing stats on the number of times he has been run out and how bad a runner he was between wickets. One wonders whether he has looked into how many occasions Sri Lanka has failed to bat out the full quota of 50 overs.
Since January 2017 Sri Lanka has played 41 ODIs and lost 30 of them and failed to bat out the 50 overs on 22 occasions. Dont those figures tell you where are weakness lies
Sri Lankas bane is their batting which has been rather inconsistent, so instead of trying to rectify and strengthen the weakness we are still persisting with this combination of playing only five specialist batsmen  that too without the experienced Mathews and the exceptionally talented Kusal Mendis - and overloading the side with all-rounders instead of going for a 7-4 combination of seven batsmen and four bowlers that has proved to be our success over the years.
Without sufficient runs on the board you cannot expect the bowlers to perform miracles on the field and win matches.
At the pre-match press conference captain Dinesh Chandimal said, I can tell that from this series we are not going to change the batting order that much going into the World Cup.
Well, if this is going to be the combination that Sri Lanka will opt for, God forbid where we will end up in the 2019 World Cup.

Sri Lanka for rule based maritime order in Indian Ocean
Sri Lanka has called for the establishment of a rule based maritime order in the Indian Ocean before geopolitical power interplays in the region to convert the Indian Ocean into a centre of tension.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe delivering the keynote address at the Indian Ocean: Defining Our Future Conference held at Temple Trees yesterday said the security and stability of the Indian Ocean could not be left to chance and that states needed to take advantage of the benign strategic atmosphere that exists to create a maritime order in the Indian Ocean that can withstand the challenges that may emerge in the future. This could create a more manageable future, he added.
The region which has the involvement of regional powers, littoral states, major maritime users of the Indian Ocean and non-state actors thus provide a hotbed for conflicts which could also extend to the sub-surface waters and the air space.
As the Prime Minister asked the 40 foreign and local delegates to use the two day platform to discuss a shared understanding of the opportunities and challenges in the Indian Ocean, he asked that they also focus on the two core issues of: Freedom of Navigation and the Freedom of Digital Connectivity.
Sri Lanka, the Prime Minister noted has taken this proactive step to provide a platform for dialogue among all partners in the region, as its economic prosperity depended on a stable rule based maritime order which would ensure that all states both small and large are treated equally.
Similarly in 1973, Sri Lanka chaired the UN Conference on the Law of the Sea which led to the adoption of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
The Prime Minister also asked that the Global Maritime Crime Program of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) help the Sri Lankan Government to set up an International Centre of Excellence on the Safety of Undersea Cables in Colombo. He further invited all countries represented at the conference to send an expert to augment the intellectual and technical capacity of the Centre.
Over 80 percent of internet traffic is transferred using undersea cables and all of the digital connectivity between the West and East traverses over the seabed adjacent to Sri Lanka.
The Centre would help assess the security imperatives, threats, vulnerabilities and responsibilities around the growth of undersea cables to ensure uninterrupted digital connectivity around the world.
The Conference which would have discussions touch on the themes of: The Indian Ocean Economy: The New Global Growth Pole; Life Below Water: Reframing the Oceans as Development Spaces; An End to Uncertainty: Safety and Security at Sea; and Reinforcing International Law in the Indian Ocean: UNCLOS and Emerging Issues, had the Prime Minister make special mention of the need to discuss the grey areas in UNCLOS.
States are somewhat hindered in taking measures against non-state actors on the high seas and despite the UNODC piracy prosecution model, a long-term solution to effectively combat and prosecute maritime crime is needed.
"Another is the sustainable exploitation of undersea resources and the partnering with other states to exploit such resources, the Prime Minister said.
UNCLOS thus would have to be reviewed to look at ways in which these resource partnerships would be equitable and ensure that these untapped resources would benefit everyone in the region, the Premier added.
The Prime Minister hoped that at the conclusion of the forum, they would be able to arrange a ministerial conference and reach a political understanding over the issues discussed, Business as usual scenario cannot end well for the region, as current geopolitical trends can have unforeseen consequences for all of us, he warned the delegates.

Sticky wicket  as China crash to 26  all out - again
KUALA LUMPUR, Thursday: China may have the world's biggest population and the second largest economy, but they are yet to impress in one area: the cricket field, where they have been humbled by minnows Nepal.
China's latest foray on the international stage ended in a huge defeat on Wednesday as they scored only 26 all out in a World Twenty20 qualifier, a total which Nepal surpassed in just 11 balls.
It wasn't even their worst innings of the tournament: China were 26 all out in their loss to Singapore, and they had scores of 35 for nine, 45, and 48 in defeats to Thailand, Bhutan and Myanmar. Given that the highest score in top-tier T20 internationals is Australia's 263 for three against Sri Lanka in 2016, China still have some way to go.
Against Nepal, opening batsman Yan Hongjiang top-scored for China with 11 runs. The next biggest contribution was the nine extras, and IPL bowler Sandeep Lamichhane picked up three wickets for four runs.
Qun Tiansen, one of eight Chinese players out for a duck, then went for 21 runs in his first and only over as Binod Bhandari smashed 24 in Nepal's quickfire reply of 29-0. Cricket in China has a short history with its national team making its first international appearance at the 2010 Asian Games.
The giant nation is known for ploughing huge sums into sports, especially football and the Olympic disciplines. But cricket does not enjoy a similar status in China.
"The size of country and its power do not matter (in cricket)," former Nepal captain Binod Das told AFP in Kathmandu.
"We shouldn't undermine them because they may takeover in future as they have capacity to invest in infrastructure and skill development."
Nepal, meanwhile, gained ODI status in March and have now set their sights on joining the world's elite by achieving Test status.
A former official with Nepal's cricket association, Chhumbi Lama, said the victory over China was always a formality for the small, Himalayan nation.
"China might be stronger in terms of power and economy than Nepal, but Nepal is stronger than China when it comes to cricket. Beating China is not a big achievement for Nepal," he told AFP. - AFP

Murder of Bharatha Lakshman and four others:
Supreme Court affirms conviction of Duminda and two others
A five judge Bench of the Supreme Court yesterday affirmed the conviction of former Defence Ministry Monitoring MP Duminda Silva and two others.
The Supreme Court Bench presided over by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep comprised Justices Buwaneka Aluvihare, Priyantha Jayawardena, Nalin Perera and Vijith Malalgoda.
The five judge Bench was unanimous in their decision to reject the appeal filed by Duminda Silva and two others against the death sentence imposed by the Colombo High Court.
The judgement of the Colombo High Court found them guilty of conspiring to commit the murder of four persons including former MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra.
Accordingly, the five-judge-Bench of the Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the decision of the Colombo High Court to impose the death sentence on eleventh accused Duminda Silva, third accused Chaminda Ravi Jayanath alias Dematagoda Chaminda and seventh accused Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Sarath Bandara.
The first accused Anura Thushara de Mel, a police officer assigned to Duminda Silvas security detail was ordered to be acquitted and released from all charges levelled against him.
The Supreme Court also directed to acquit Duminda Silva, Chaminda Ravi Jayanath and Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Sarath Bandara from charges relating to possession of illegal firearms.
Courtroom (No.502) of the Supreme Court was packed with lawyers, journalists, relatives of accused and curious onlookers, at the time the judgment was delivered. The judgment was delivered around 2:50 pm by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep who is in his final week on the bench.
Four accused including former Defence Ministry Monitoring MP Duminda Silva had filed an appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the judgment of Colombo High Court.
Duminda Silva, the eleventh accused in the murder case earlier filed apetition in the Supreme Court requesting that the hearing of the appeal be accelerated on medical grounds.
Through his appeal, Duminda Silva stated that he sought the jurisdiction of Supreme Court to review and set aside their conviction and the death sentence imposed by High Court on September 8, 2016.
Five accused including former MP Duminda Silva were on September 8, 2016 sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court for committing the murder of four persons including former MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra on October 8, 2011.
However, the verdict was divided two to one with judges Pathmini N.Ranawaka and M.C.B.S. Moraes finding the five accused guilty for 10 charges including committing and conspiring to commit murder of four people while Justice Shiran Gunaratne, the President of Colombo High Court Trial-at-Bar found the thirteen accused not guilty of all seventeen charges. The tenth accused Janaka Bandara Galagoda who was also sentenced to death is evading Courts since the inception of the police inquiry.
While delivering the judgment, two High Court Judges Pathmini N. Ranawaka Gunatilleke and M.C.B.S. Moraes unanimously decided that the prosecutors have proved the five accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. High Court Judge Pathmini N. RanawakaGunatilleke observed that the provocative behaviour of the eleventh accused Duminda Silva led to the whole incident.
The Judge further observed that the evidence have proved that Duminda Silva had provided leadership to the unruly behaviour of the mob and therefore he should be held responsibile for the whole incident. She further observed that the JMO reports have revealed that Duminda Silva was under the influence of liquor at the time of the incident, but deceased Bharatha Premachandra was not .
However, High Court Judge Shiran Gunaratne found all accused not guilty citing there are no substantial evidence to charge them under 17 counts.
He observed that the evidence presented by the investigative officers was contradictory in nature and the benefit of the doubt should go to the accused.
The accused were charged on 17 counts including committing and conspiring to commit murder of four individuals,including Bharatha Premachandra, Dharshana Jayathilaka, Mohamed Azmy and Manimel Kumaraswamy and inflicting gunshot injuries on Mr.Premachandras bodyguard Rajapurage Gamini after being members of an unlawful assembly on October 8, 2011, at Walpola, Mulleriyawa.
The accused had been charged under Section 296, 140, 146, 147, 486 and 300 of the Penal Code. They were further charged under the offences of Firearms Act. The Attorney General had called 42 witnesses and presented in Courts 126 documents including the Governments Analysts reports and JMO reports.
Presidents Counsel Anil de Silva, Shavindra Fernando PC, Anuja Premaratne PC, Anura Meddegoda PC and Saliya Peiris PC appeared for the accused. Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General.
[Four people, including my father were gunned down in broad daylight - Hirunika]
UNP MP Hirunika Premachandra commenting on the verdict yesterday said it does not change the fact that four people were gunned down on the street in broad daylight including my father.
Upon hearing the verdict confirming the death sentence for the murder of Bharatha Lakshman, ex-MP Duminda muttered Kamak nehe ithin (Never mind) as the rest broke into tears in the Supreme Court following the unanimous verdict by the Five Judge Bench. Silva & the 3 accused have no further appeal.

Ton-up Khawaja helps Australia save draw against Pakistan
Dubai, Thursday: Opener Usman Khawaja hit a fighting hundred to foil Pakistan and help Australia escape with a draw in the first Test in Dubai on Thursday.
The left-hander hit a solid 141 for his seventh Test hundred, while skipper Tim Paine (61 not out) and Travis Head (72) also hit half centuries as Australia finished at 362-8 late in the day with lights coming on at Dubai stadium.
After Khawaja was dismissed with 14.3 overs left and Yasir Shah quickly removed Mitchell Starc (one) and Peter Siddle (nought), Paine and number ten Nathan Lyon (five not out) survived 12.1 overs.
Both had some anxious moments before players shook hands with one ball to go in leg-spinner Yasir's final over.
Yasir had shaken the Australian innings with 4-114 but Australia clung on. They have now won two and drawn two of their 16 Tests in Asia since 2012.
Australia's hero was Khawaja, who started the day on 50 not out as Australia resumed on 136-3.
Khawaja and Head added 79 before lunch as Pakistan failed to take a wicket in the first session. The pair eventually put on an invaluable 132 runs for the fourth wicket.
Khawaja, who was born in Pakistan but moved to Australia as a child, batted for eight hours 44 minutes and faced 302 balls before he was sixth man out in the final session. He was trapped leg-before sweeping Yasir.
Khawaja, who hit 11 boundaries, had a top score of 26 in five previous Tests in Asia.
His innings was the second longest in the fourth innings of a Test, behind England's Michael Atherton's 645 minute vigil in scoring 185 not out against South Africa in Johannesburg in 1995.
It was the highest fourth-innings score by any visiting batsman in Asia, beating New Zealand's Daniel Vettori's 140 made at Colombo against Sri Lanka nine years ago.
Pakistan started the day needing seven wickets to win but nothing worked for skipper Sarfraz Ahmed, despite multiple bowling changes.
Pakistan could have had Head leg-before off leg-spinner Yasir on 44, but Sarfraz did not review umpire Richard Kettleborough's not out decision. Replays showed the ball was hitting the stumps.
Pakistan were only rewarded when they took the second new ball as soon as it was due and Hafeez trapped Head leg-before with the first ball.
Australia wobbled but Khawaja and Paine, who batted for 3 hours and 39 minutes, ensured a draw.
The second Test starts in Abu Dhabi from October 16.
Pakistan opener Imam-ul-Haq will miss the match after he suffered a fractured finger fielding on Thursday. AFP

Tourism infrastructure  development drive in North
As part of its comprehensive plans to develop tourism in the Northern Province, the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) opened the newly constructed Comfort Centres at Talaimannar for the use of local and foreign tourists visiting the beach.
Tourism Development and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga and Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneshwaran declared the Comfort Centres, which marked the first step of a larger infrastructure development programme, open. Local government heads, provincial tourism authorities and senior state officials in the area also attended the brief ceremony.
The SLTDA spent Rs. 20 million for the project benefitting over 1,000 tourists visiting the beach on a weekly basis. It also strengthens Talaimannars potential of becoming a key tourism hub in the Northern Province. SLTDA Chairman Kavan Ratnayaka said, This may be a relatively small investment and a brief ceremony. But every long journey starts with one single step. This signals we have larger plans for tourism development in the Northern province and we are ready to facilitate its growth.
