Terrorism is the prioritised security concern: Major General Mahesh Senanayake
The biannual academic sessions of the Officer Career Development Centre (OCDC) at Buttala commenced last Wednesday. Chief of Staff of the Army, Major General Mahesh Senanayake delivered the keynote address as the Chief Guest.
In his keynote address, Major General Senanayake reminded the gathering that the overall pattern in nature of conflict and the entire spectrum of security environment had changed over time. Degree of escalation of conflicts has been increased in size, dispersion, effect and complexity. States have got bogged down by threats and challenges, like ethnic conflicts, fundamentalism, separatism, insurgencies, illegal migrations, public disorder and terrorism, in addition to the other issues such as those related to environment degradation, mass migration, influx of refugees, epidemics and disasters, etc, he pointed out.
On the other hand, increased developments of technological innovations, advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, genetics, neurosciences, computing, etc are among other factors that pose a threat to peace and stability.
Similarly, one should not undermine the importance of concentration on Human Rights and Humanitarian Law in any future operational environment, Senanayake underlined.
Referring to the future of military engagement, the keynote speaker highlighted terrorism to be considered as the prioritized security concern. We are the guardians of all Sri Lankans, and the Army is the nations means to seize, retain and exploit the opportunities.
Terrorism is at the forefront of our security concerns and we have to nip the origins of terrorism in the bud. Constructive engagement with international and regional intelligence players is therefore, a must. The Army should be agile, lethal, versatile and modernized to suit tomorrows operations.
That is the need of the hour. Close combination with Navy and Air Force is another essential component, since the Army should act as a capability-based force and not a threat-based one, because threats are always hard to predict.
Likewise, capacity development in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations of the Army are also needed to be given due attention, he said.
The two-day long sessions, themed mainly on Changing Security Landscape: Role of Sri Lankan Forces have been listed under five major sub topic sessions to suit the main theme in addition to the opening session.
Civil and military resource personnel, drawn from specific spheres of expertise during respective sessions will dwell on Existing and Emerging Threats to Peace and Stability, Sensitization and Exploitation of Religious, Ethnic & Political Issues, Technological Advancement, Dependence and Potential Threats, Geo-political Interests and the World Order and Challenges to Sri Lankan Armed Forces in Countering Future Threats during the sessions, attended by over 60 senior and middle rank tri service and Police officers.
Major General Ralph Nugera, Brigadier C.S.N Mudannayake (Retd), Nishan De Mel, Lasantha Wickramasooriya, Dr Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu and Prof. Imtiaz Ahamed contributed to the sessions on the first day.
Prof. Shantha K. Hennayake, Asantha Senevirathna, Sanath De Silva, Major General K.P.A Jayasekara, Major General B.H.M.A Wijesinghe, Brigadier G.V Ravipriya, Brigadier M.D.U.V Gunatilleka, Colonel S.A Kulathunga and Lieutenant Colonel K.V.P Dhammika addressed the second day sessions.

10 best TOP FIVE BATTING
With the highly-awaited ICC Champions Trophy 2017 less than a fortnight away, the top eight teams in the ICC ODI Team Rankings are all set to lock horns in England and Wales for the top prize. While cricket is a team sport based on collective drive, instances of one individual influencing the outcome of a match are numerous. Heres a look back at five each of the best batting and bowling performances in the history of the competition.
[TOP FIVE BATTING PERFORMANCES]
Sachin Tendulkar, India v Australia, 28 October 1998, Dhaka
Australia, which 48 hours earlier had clinched a three-Test series against Pakistan 1-0, would have had no clue that its star-studded XI would be blown away by a one man in its first match of the inaugural ICC Champions Trophy, then known as the ICC KnockOut Trophy. 
The Steve Waugh-led side started off well by reducing India to 8 for 2 but then had no answer to Sachin Tendulkars master class. The Indian opener struck a magnificent 141 off just 128 balls at the Bangabandhu National Stadium, blasting 13 fours and three sixes in route to his 19th One-Day International century. Tendulkar shared a couple of 100-plus partnerships, with Rahul Dravid (48) and Ajay Jadeja (71) respectively, to guide India to a massive total of 307 for 8. He then returned to weave a spin-web around the Australian batsmen with his mixture of off-breaks and leg-breaks, grabbing 4 for 38 to pack Australia off for 263 and give India a 44-run win.
Jacques Kallis, South Africa v Sri Lanka, 30 October 1998, Dhaka
In a match affected by rain, Jacques Kallis smoked as five sixes and as many boundaries to score a brilliant 113* off 107 deliveries in the semi-final against Sri Lanka.
The all-rounder was the only batsman to score more than 30 from both sides combined, and single-handedly led South Africa to a total of 240 for 7 in 39 overs. Kallis, who was still carving a spot for himself in the South African line-up, mixed caution with aggression on a tricky surface and crafted a dominating inning against a strong bowling attack. In reply, Sri Lanka folded for just 132 runs, giving South Africa a 92-run win and a ticket to the final.
South Africa went on to defeat West Indies in the final to be crowned the maiden champions  its only experience of winning a major ICC trophy.
Andy Flower, Zimbabwe v India, 14 September 2002, Colombo
Andy Flower constructed one of the greatest One-Day International hundreds in pursuit of Indias formidable total of 288 for 6 at the R Premadasa Stadium, but when he eventually fell for a 164-ball 145 with 13 fours, his side went down by 14 runs in a thrilling contest. Rahul Dravid (71) and Mohammad Kaif (111 not out) had earlier rescued India from 87 for 5 and lifted it a challenging total.
In reply, Andy found no support from the other end, except for handy contributions from brother Grant (33) and Guy Whittall (29). As a result, Zimbabwe could only manage to reach 274 for 8.
Shikhar Dhawan, India v South Africa, 6 June 2013, Cardiff
Shikhar Dhawan set the 2013 competition alight with his maiden One Day International century in the very first game of Indias successful campaign against South Africa at Sophia Garden. The stylish left-handed stroke-maker carved a 94-ball 114 and added 127 for the first wicket with Rohit Sharma (65) to give India a tremendous start. Dhawan found the fence on 12 occasions and went over it once. With some help from Ravindra Jadejas breezy 47 off 29 balls, India posted a mammoth total of 331. South Africa fought hard in reply but fell short by 26 runs. Dhawan carried his form throughout the tournament and ended up winning the golden bat for scoring the most number of runs in this edition - 363 in five matches. He was also named the player of the tournament for his significant role in India lifting the cup at Edgbaston, Birmingham.
 ICC news
Shane Watson, Australia v England, 2 October 2009, Centurion
The 2009 edition of the Champions Trophy in South Africa was the first time that I really felt like I belonged at the international level. These last two games in particular, really were the making of me as an international all-rounder, wrote Shane Watson recently in his ICC column. After taking two wickets to help dismiss England for 257 in the semi-final in Centurion, Watson powered his way to 136 not out off 132 balls, including 10 fours and seven sixes, to take his side home with more than eight overs to spare. The explosive all-rounder added 242 runs for the second wicket with Ricky Ponting (111*) to make short work of Englands total. He backed it up in the final with yet another century (105*) to destroy New Zealand and help Australia retain the title.

[TOP FIVE BOWLING PERFORMANCES]
Lasith Malinga, Sri Lanka v New Zealand, 9 June 2013, Cardiff
Lasith Malinga delivered one of the most breathtaking spells of the 2013 edition but couldnt earn Sri Lanka victory over New Zealand in a low-scoring thriller.
On a flat pitch with sun out and the ball not swinging, Slinga Malinga collected 4 for 34 and made the 138-run chase terribly difficult for the Brendon McCullum-led side.
From 48 for 1, New Zealand stumbled to 49 for 4 and then to 80 for 6. Nathan McCullum (32) and Tim Southee (13) batted with maturity once Malinga was off the attack and swung the pendulum in New Zealands favour. Cruising at 115 for 6 with the McCullum brothers in the middle, Malinga returned to throw a final twist by dismissing both in the space of three deliveries.
Mitchell McClenaghan, who played a key role in the first innings with figures of 4 for 43, hung around with Southee to give New Zealand its first win over Sri Lanka in four years.
Farveez Maharoof, Sri Lanka v West Indies, 14 October 2006, Mumbai
Farveez Maharoof holds the best analysis in the history of the tournament - 9-2-14-6, achieved against West Indies at the Brabourne Stadium in a qualifying group match. Once Chaminda Vaas and Lasith Malinga reduced West Indies to 13 for 3, Maharoof produced the best spell of his career. There was no barrage of bouncers or toe-crushing yorkers. Instead, in the right-arm medium-pacers own words: I kept it simple, with a touch of seam movement. West Indies lost its last seven batsmen for 29 runs and was bundled out for just 80 runs  the third lowest in the Champions Trophy. Sri Lanka then went on to chase the total down with 36.4 overs to spare.
Makhaya Ntini, South Africa v Pakistan, 27 October 2006, Mohali
Having only managed 213 runs on a greenish pitch with trampoline bounce at the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium, Makhaya Ntini unleashed a threatening opening spell to blast out five wickets for just eight runs in his first five overs and propel South Africa to a dominating 124-run win over Pakistan. Yasir Arafat (27), the No. 9, was the only batsman who managed to outscore Extras (16).
The late Bob Woolmer went on to an extent of terming it the worst batting Ive seen by Pakistan in my time as coach.
Before the game, Graeme Smith, the skipper, said his team was feeling at home with the conditions and Ntini with his hostile pace bowling indeed made Mohali look like Durban.
Aravinda de Silva, Sri Lanka v Australia, 27 September 2002, Colombo
In his only spell of 10 overs in the Champions Trophy, Aravinda de Silva ended his full quota of off-spin with the remarkable figures of 1 for 16 in the semi-final against Australia. Predominantly a batsman, de Silva was named the man of the match for his miserly spell, which put him in second position, behind only South African Dale Benkenstein (1.30), in the list of most economical bowlers in the history of the competition. Australia could only push to a total of 162 on a turning track. Sri Lanka had little trouble in hunting down the target, winning by seven wickets and then going on to share the trophy with India after rain interrupted the finals two days on the trot.
Shayne OConnor, New Zealand v Pakistan, 11 October 2000, Nairobi
At 237 for 6 with 25 balls remaining, and a set Abdul Razzaq (48) and Wasim Akram (34) out in the middle, Pakistan looked all set to post a daunting total on a tricky pitch at the Gymkhana Club Ground. Shayne OConnor, the left-arm fast-medium bowler, then ran through the lower order with four wickets in the space of nine deliveries to send Pakistan packing for 252.
Having already accounted for Imran Nazir earlier in the game, OConnor finished with the figures of 5 for 46, then the best haul of the tournament.

All Blacks coach expects to quit in 2019 - report
Wellington:All Blacks coach Steve Hansen has said he is likely to step down after the next World Cup in 2019, according to a report on Friday.
"I think, without committing to it 100 percent, I can't see myself extending beyond the World Cup," the New Zealand Herald quoted Hansen as saying.
Hansen, who is preparing for a three-Test series with the British and Irish Lions, will attempt to win New Zealand's third straight title at the 2019 World Cup in Japan.
By 2019, Hansen will have been with the All Blacks for 15 years after being assistant coach to Graham Henry from 2004 to 2011 before becoming head coach.
In that time, the All Blacks crashed out of the 2007 World Cup in the quarter-finals but recovered to be world champions in 2011 and 2015.
The 58-year-old former policeman had previously believed the head coach should be changed mid-way through a World Cup cycle, and indicated after the 2015 victory that he would step down this year.
However, he was convinced by New Zealand Rugby (NZR) to change his mind and his contract has been extended to 2019.
"I guess I am kind of arguing against myself," said Hansen, whose international career began with coaching Wales from 2002 to 2004.
"There is a lot of scrutiny and I will be forever thankful for the opportunity. But top of the pyramid is my family and it will probably be time to give them more."
Hansen gave no indication of who he would like to see as his successor. "Then it comes down to do they (NZR) want continuity from a head coaching point of view, or do they want someone new. That will be up to the appointment panel. There are some good candidates," he said.
If the option is for continuity then current assistant coach Ian Foster, who earlier this week re-signed with NZR through to the Japan World Cup, would be the front-runner.
But if New Zealand looks outside the current set-up, leading contenders would include Ireland coach Joe Schmidt and Wales coach Warren Gatland, who will also lead the Lions in their tour of New Zealand.

Antonians make Kandy proud
KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP:
St. Anthonys College made Kandy proud by winning the Plate. The eight-team Plate contest, took place on par with the Cup championship and SACK came out with some top class rugby to win the first league title for the Katugastota school. From next season they will be playing in the Division I. A big hand should go to their players and the rugby committee. Their quarterfinal game in the President's trophy knockouts is with Isipathana College. St. Anthonys took to rugby long after the school introduced sports like cricket, boxing hockey, football and athletics. It was in the 1950s that they started rugby with Bruce Winter as their first rugby captain. Credit should go to Old Trinitian Bobby Jayaweera, the man who taught them how to handle a rugger ball and later Maurice Perera, another Trinitian gave the final touches to the Antonian rugby team. From the day they took to the game, this sport became very popular. Though they started rugby in the 1950s it was only in 1961 that enthusiasm was created and rugby received a big boost at St. Anthonys and backing from all quarters. At the inception, most of the schools provided the Antonians with the 2nd XV fixtures.
It was only in 1962 that they were permitted to play against the 1st XV teams. It was H.M. Kuthdoos who led the Trinitians to draw the match for the first time against Trinity led by Ajith Abeyaratne in 1969, and in 1972 Tuan Doole led the Antonians to beat Trinity for the first time. Then in 1988 under Leroy Fonseka they emerged runners-up in the League Championship. Of all the ruggerites produced by St Anthonys, Priyantha Ekanayake stands tall and above all should be very proud of being the first to captain the Sri Lanka rugby team from the school and that too for a record ten consecutive years. He also had the privilege of leading the national team for four consecutive Asiads a record yet to be broken. At present the 1991 skipper Lasantha Wijesuriya is the Rugby technical committee chairman. Lasantha and the coaches went all out to tune the side to win the Plate.

His cremation took place on Thursday at Kanatte amidst a large gathering.
Harsha makes Kandy proud

Whatever is said and done schools are doing well.
Global Antonians to give a helping hand

The President made this statement when the Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne called on him at the Shangri-La Hotel in Sydney, on Thursday.
Payne thanked the President for excellent cooperation extended to Australia in curbing human smuggling and added that the cooperation could be further extended.
President Sirisena said that drug smuggling has also become a major threat to many countries and emphasized the need for broad international cooperation to eliminate the drug menace.
Defence Minister, explaining the experience gained by the Australian Navy over the years to prevent drug smuggling, said drugs have become a major threat to many societies because of its harmful effects on the young generation. On the other hand, the drug smugglers use the profits to fund terrorist organizations and it is a major problem to law and order in many countries, she pointed out. Hence, Australia is willing to closely cooperate with Sri Lanka in this field and provide every possible assistance to the Sri Lanka Navy and Coast Guard, Payne assured the President.
Australia currently provides training to military cadets from Sri Lanka, and the Defence Minister acceded to the Presidents request to expand training facilities to include middle-level and senior military officers.

Bilateral trade between Sri Lanka, Vietnam will be increased: Prime Minister
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the bilateral trade between Sri Lanka and Vietnam will be increased from US$ 364.42 million to US$ 1 billion within coming years.
He was delivering the keynote speech at the Sri Lanka-Vietnam Investment Forum held on April 18 at the La Veranda Hall of the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hotel, Ha Noi on April 18.
The Embassy of Sri Lanka in Vietnam organised the Forum to coincide with the official visit of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to Viet Nam.
The Prime Minister highlighted the importance of promoting tourism between two countries. He said South Asia and the Middle East have growing economics and the growing of the middle class of those regions are obvious, and therefore Vietnamese business can make good use of it. The Prime Minister pointed out the importance of the positioning of the Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean to become a logistic, business and financial hub. He said the present Unity Government of Sri Lanka has focuses on political stability, reconciliation between different ethnic groups and promoting highly competitive social market economy. The Prime Minister said the Sri Lankan has a niche market in Europe with its garments known for ethical manufacturing as well as solid tyres. He said market would expand for Sri Lankan products more with regaining GSP+ facility to EU market. He said Sri Lanka is ready to become a manufacturing hub to boom the service sector - especially Information and Digital Technology, Off-shore Financing, Healthcare and Agricultural Services. The Prime Minster invited Vietnamese business community to visit Sri Lanka to explore investment opportunities in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lankan Ambassador in Vietnam Hasanthi Urugodawatte Disaanayake recalled rapid growth in bilateral political and economic relations with both countries being fast developing economies, having emerged from very painful conflicts. She added that as Sri Lanka makes firm strides in the post-conflict era, reconciling the past and building the future, Sri Lanka does draw inspiration from Vietnam for its tremendous economic progress in the last two decades.
"As the Industries, Science and Technology Minister, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was responsible for Sri Lanka's second round of economic liberalisation that commenced in 1989, focusing on financial de-regularisation and industrial promotion in rural areas through infrastructure development and the institution of industrial estates; a testimony for his visionary thoughts turned into action, she said.
Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said the possibility of using Sri Lanka as a gateway to India, Pakistan and Bangladesh by the Vietnamese businesses. He said Sri Lanka is an emerging economy in the South Asia region like Viet Nam is an emerging economy in South East Asia. He said that according to international economic agencies, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh are poised to be the fast growing economies in next 20-30 years with fast growing GDP and low cost of manufacturing, apart from that India and China.
The Minister highlighted the benefits expected to accrue from Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement as well as other bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that Sri Lanka is party to. He said Sri Lanka can be used as an industrial base and value added logistic hub by Vietnam to enter the Indian market.
Through the China-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement and the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with Singapore, Vietnamese business could grab further opportunities, the Minister said.
Chairman and the President of the Viet Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) Dr. Vu Tien Loc recalled the Vietnam-Sri Lanka Business Forum held in Colombo during the visit of former Vietnamese President Truong Tan Sang to Sri Lanka in October 2011 and the practical guidance shared by President Sang on further developing economic and trade ties between the two countries. He said both countries are now cooperating closely and since recently had seen surge of activities for economic cooperation and this new trend is good and is beneficial. He said the Sri LankaVietnam Investment Forum would be a good opportunity for Sri Lankan and Vietnamese businesses to get-to-know about business environment in each others countrys, exchange information, seek more business opportunities which would contribute to the development of trade and investment relations between Vietnam and Sri Lanka.

Election campaign resumes after Manchester attack
UK: Britain's politicians resume campaigning in earnest on Friday with national security in the spotlight, as police scramble to bust a Libya-linked jihadist network thought to be behind the Manchester terror attack.
Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had suspended campaigning after Monday's bombing at a Manchester pop concert, which killed 22 people, including many teenagers, and wounded dozens more.
Eight suspects are currently in detention on UK soil in connection with the blast, for which the Islamic State group has claimed responsibility, while police in Libya have detained the father and brother of 22-year-old suicide bomber Salman Abedi.
Washington's top diplomat Rex Tillerson is due to visit London on Friday in an expression of solidarity, after Britain reacted furiously to leaks of sensitive details about the investigation to US media.
US President Donald Trump threatened to prosecute those responsible for the deeply troubling security breach, which has strained the close relationship between Washington and London.
At a summit of NATO allies in Brussels on Thursday, May confronted Trump over the issue, saying shared intelligence should be kept secure, her spokesman said.
Monday's bombing was the latest in a series of IS-claimed attacks in Europe that have coincided with an offensive on the jihadist group in Syria and Iraq by US, British and other Western forces.
Britain's terror threat assessment has been hiked to critical, the highest level, meaning an attack is considered imminent.
Armed troops have also been sent to guard important sites, an unusual sight in mainland Britain, while armed police are now patrolling the country's trains for the first time.
At the launch of the UK Independence Party's manifesto on Thursday, deputy leader Suzanne Evans said May must bear some responsibility for the terror attack in Manchester this week due to policing budget cuts.
Opposition leader Corbyn in a speech in London later on Friday is expected to say it is the responsibility of governments to minimise the risk of terror by giving police the funding they need.
A YouGov poll published in Friday's edition of The Times put Conservatives on 43 percent compared to Labour on 38 percent, far better for Labour than the double-digit margin that had previously separately it from the ruling party.
YouGov polled 2,052 people on Wednesday and Thursday.
But analysts said that the Conservative prime minister -- who previously served as interior minister for six years -- could benefit at the polls from the shift in focus ahead of the general election on June 8.
If security and terrorism become more prominent then I can only see one winner from this -- Theresa May, said Steven Fielding, a Professor of Politics at the University of Nottingham.
The YouGov poll also found that 41 percent of respondents said that the Conservatives would handle defence and security best, compared to 18 percent who said the same of Labour.
At the G7 summit in Sicily on Friday, May will emphasise the importance of tackling the spread of terror online by urging internet companies to do more to remove extremist content.
The premier's visit to Italy has been cut short following the attack in Britain, where police are continuing their manhunt for the bomber's accomplices.
Officers briefly evacuated residents from an area in Wigan, a town near Manchester, on Thursday as they searched a house in connection with the probe and a bomb disposal unit was deployed.
Residents were later allowed to return.
Manchester-born Abedi, a university dropout, grew up in a Libyan family that reportedly fled to the northwestern English city to escape the now-fallen regime of Libyan dictator Moamer Kadhafi.
Libyan officials said he and his brother Hashem belonged to the Islamic State group, while their father Ramadan once belonged to a now-disbanded militant group with alleged ties to Al-Qaeda.
Libya said it was working closely with Britain to identify possible terrorist networks involved, while a British official said that Abedi had been on the intelligence radar before the massacre.
On Friday evening a defiant Manchester is set to go ahead with hosting an athletics contest, the Great City Games, in which the likes of former world 100 metres champion Kim Collins are due to compete amid robust security.
Following a minute's silence in the city's St Ann's Square on Thursday, crowds broke into a spontaneous rendition of Don't Look Back in Anger by the city's own Britpop band Oasis.
Queen Elizabeth II also visited a Manchester hospital to meet children injured in the very wicked attack, which happened at the end of a concert by US pop star Ariana Grande.
Some 75 people were still being treated in hospital, including 23 in critical condition, medical officials said.
Twelve of those injured were under 16, and the youngest killed was an eight-year-old girl.- AFP

Ellepola chief guest at Bradby first leg
Tikiri Ellepola, a top class third row forward to come out of Trinity College was the chief guest at the first leg of the Bradby Shield rugby match between Royal College and Trinity College at Pallekelle.
Ellepola, who led Trinity in 1980, said it was a good game and the better side of the day won the match. In this instance it was Royal.
Under Ellepolas captaincy in 1980, the Bradby Shield encounter produced fascinating rugby and several memorable moments. In 1980 Sujantha Kumar's fresher-laden Royalists edged out Trinity by 7 points to 3 in the first leg at Longden Place helped by a try by young Sriyan Cooray and a penalty by prop forward Nimalasiri.
In the return match at Nittawela the Royalists came up with a superlative display to notch up a convincing 16-6 win with flanker Seevali Jayasinghe and centre Sumith Fonseka scoring two splendid tries. Prop forward Nimalasiri too played a key role in their success by firing across two penalties from 35 metres out and converted the try scored by Fonseka from a difficult angle to help the Reid Avenue school to retain the Bradby shield for the third successive year. Ellepola played with players like J.V. Tissera, R. Bandaranayakle, and B.S.J. Fernando.

For fans, cricket is the real winner in an Ind-Pak game
One Hackney cricket fan hailed his sport the real champion after narrowly missing out on Edgbaston Fans T20 Trophy glory in Birmingham on Monday.
Facing an Indian fans side, Rizwan Siddiquis team sacrificed their lead to lose by five runs, with a Super Over required to settle the tie.
Due to inclement weather, the match was moved from its original venue, Attock Cricket Club, indoors to the Edgbaston Cricket Centre, but that didnt stop the players from showing their prowess at the wicket.
With India taking on Pakistan during the ICC Champions Trophy on June 4 at Edgbaston, Mondays event provided the perfect prequel to the big game.
And for local government worker Siddiqui, he couldnt have been prouder to have donned the Pakistan shirt.
As has happened a lot in recent years, Pakistan lost to India in a cricket match, said the 40-year-old.
Were kind of used to it as fans but now we have experienced it as players, and it is not a feeling that we like.
I thought we played the first game really well. We played good indoor cricket, we ran well, fielded well, and batted sensibly.
We had that game under control after four overs. A couple of loose overs then went and all of a sudden, we started panicking. The pressure was on us, and we didnt respond well.
In the Super Over, we needed six of the last ball to win, and unfortunately we didnt get that.
India versus Pakistan is a good showcase of cricket, and a good way for fans from both countries to come together and enjoy the game.
If India versus Pakistan in a couple of weeks is anything as tight as this, I think the fans will go home happy.
We gave it our all. One team had to win, one team had to lose, unfortunately that was us but hopefully the tables are turned on June 4.
The Edgbaston Fans T20 Trophy was established in 2016 with a match between Englands Barmy Army and Pakistan, and this year welcomed the ICC Champions Trophy, along with the ICC Womens World Cup, as the Nissan Trophy Tour reached Birmingham. As one of three venues for the ICC Champions Trophy  which takes place from June 1-18  Edgbaston will host five games, including one semi-final, with Pakistan versus India expected to be the biggest of them all.
Its really important to bring Indian and Pakistani communities together like this, especially under the banner of the ECB, said Gulfran Riaz, chairman of the National Asian Cricket Council.
The more we can get the Asian cricketing communities closer to established set-ups, it allows the players to come and experience things like this which they wouldnt normally do.
Its great to bring people together who are from almost two ends of the scale, and this can only do good for the community and the cricketing family.
I think cricket was the winner today. Its all part of the game  someone wins, someone loses.

Floods, landslides wreak havoc
South West Monsoon starts:
Flash floods and landslides triggered by incessant rains killed more than 50 people in the Kalutara, Galle and Matara districts leaving hundreds of families homeless.
Many districts experienced heavy down pour ending a long spell of dry weather last week. Many parts of the country experienced torrential rains with the onset of the South West Monsoon ending the drought of more than five months.
Hundreds of families in the banks of Ginganga, Nilwala, Kalu and Ve and Kuru rivers were forced to leave their houses as water levels were on the rise creating floods in the area. Hundreds of houses in the Elapatha Divisional Secretariat area in the Ratnapura district came under water with the overflowing of Hangamuwa canal.
The government deployed the Tri Forces for the rescue of thousands of people trapped in floods and landslides in the Kalutara and Galle districts. The Air force deployed helicopters to the affected areas to assist the rescue operation, while the Navy boats were in operation in flood hit areas to bring the people affected by floods to safer places.
District Secretaries with the help of Disaster Management officials at district level are providing facilities to the flood affected. Relief camps have been kept ready to provide accommodation to the people who are displaced by the floods and landslide in every district.
Hundreds of people in Hangamuwa, Aluketiya, Mudduwa, Muwagama, Kahangama, Devalagawa were displaced by the flash floods. Many villagers at Hamgamuwa in Ratnapura said they did not experience any sign of flood when they went to sleep on Thursday night.
Chaminda Prasad Wickremasinghe of Hangamuwa said he was fast asleep when he heard residents yelling out Ganwathura Enawo (Flood coming)
The water level of my hardware shop rose to above six feet within 30 minutes," he said.
He said his hardware store came under water within an hour destroying cement, paints and other items stored for sale.

Floyd Mayweather v Conor McGregor 'would be a circus' - Oscar de la Hoya
A fight between Floyd Mayweather and UFC lightweight champion Conor McGregor would be a "circus" and a "farce", says boxing great Oscar de la Hoya.
Ireland's McGregor, 28, claims he has signed his half of a deal to face 40-year-old Mayweather, who retired unbeaten in 2015 after 49 fights. The American has said there is a "90% chance" he will take on McGregor if he returns to the ring.
"Success in one sport doesn't guarantee success in another," said De la Hoya. The former six-weight world champion, who lost a close points decision to Mayweather 10 years ago, added: "It's not like McGregor would be fighting a good fighter, let alone a mediocre one - he would be fighting the best.
"It looks more and more likely that the circus known as Floyd Mayweather v Conor McGregor will be coming to town in the near future. "One group will eventually be left to make sure this farce doesn't occur: We, the fans, who are the lifeblood of our sport.
"I fully understand the initial attraction from any fan of combat sports. McGregor is almost certainly the best pound-for-pound MMA fighter. Floyd is Floyd - the most dominant boxer of his time. "Let's be clear, these are two different sports."
In an open letter posted on Facebook, De la Hoya, who retired in 2009, wrote: "My interest is in the health of boxing as a whole. Our sport might not ever recover.
"To use a bit of an extreme analogy, I happen to be a pretty good golfer. Would I be able to compete with Rory McIlroy, Jordan Speith or Sergio Garcia Of course not. Nor would I think to try." BBC Sports

High excitement for Tendulkar movie despite mixed reviews
NEW DELHI May26: Critics called the new Sachin Tendulkar biopic hagiographic but fans of the Indian cricket legend loved the work that hit screens amid nationwide fanfare on Friday.
Sachin: A Billion Dreams, directed by Emmy-nominated British filmmaker James Erskine, brought out throngs of fans from the first day.
It has real footage of the right-handed batsman who made his debut for India in 1989 aged just 16, but its claims to reveal the more intimate side of the icon did not impress reviewers.
Sachin: A Billion Dreams is a well-made effort, looks good, but when you reach out for something insightful, your hand closes on air, Indian Express sports journalist Sriram Veera wrote.
It's the dumbing down that makes you sigh. It's a movie (docu-feature) that you would take your kids to ... The real disappointment lies in the absence of any insights, Veera added.
Tendulkar, recipient of India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, is the only cricketer to have scored 100 international centuries and the highest run scorer in international cricket with more than 34,000 runs.
But The Times of India gave the movie three stars out of five and slammed what it called the hagiographic narrative. Most controversies around the cricketing God are glossed over. Many of us (me included) die-hard Sachin fans are ready to face the fact that our icon may have displayed feet of clay on occasion, the review said.
However, the film doesn't take chances ... The hagiographic narrative continues with commentators, critics and colleagues -- Dhoni, Kohli, Ganguly, Sehwag and Harbhajan are (sigh!) only eulogizing the Little Master. Tendulkar's autobiography released in 2014 got a similar response from critics who wanted a more open account.
Tendulkar, 44, who retired in November 2013, admits he is a private person who has struggled to expose himself to the media. He has been criticised for not speaking enough on major cricketing issues.
However a review by British daily The Guardian praised Erskine's effort to bring together the life of person who was the closest thing Indian cricket has to a living deity. Cricketers also gave their thumbs up to the epic which was screened for the Indian team before they left for England to defend the Champions Trophy.
Thank you @sachin_rt Paaji for arranging the perfect send-off, skipper Virat Kohli wrote on his twitter account after watching the film in Mumbai. AFP

PARIS May26,: Rafael Nadal insisted Friday that he didn't care if he was regarded as the favourite for a 10th French Open, even if his rivals begged to differ.
100% he's the big favourite, said Austrian star Dominic Thiem, one of the support cast waiting in the wings should the great Spaniard slip up. Of course I think he's back at his best this year, and then also he won here nine times. So he knows how it works to win here.
I think he will try everything to win Le Dcima, I think it will be very unique in tennis to win a Grand Slam title ten times. It's pretty crazy, I guess. So 100% he's the one to beat and the big favourite.
Thiem, the 23-year-old world number nine, has already faced Nadal three times on clay this spring -- losing in the finals in Barcelona and Madrid before gaining revenge in the quarter-finals in Rome.
It's that kind of surprising setback -- Nadal's only loss on clay this year -- that has the 30-year-old Spaniard eager to calm the mood.

Jayawardene named coach of Bangladesh league team
DHAKA May 26: Former Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene was Friday named as the head coach of the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) side Khulna Titans for the next two seasons of the Twenty20 tournament.
Jayawardene, who has plied his trade across the globe after taking international retirement in 2015, played for BPL franchise Dhaka Dynamites last season.
This will be the second stint for the Sri Lankan great as a head coach of a team, following his success with current Indian Premier League (IPL) champions Mumbai Indians.
Jayawardene, who succeeded former Australian captain Ricky Ponting as coach of Mumbai, helped the Indian side to a landmark third IPL title in the 10th edition of the cash-rich league.
We are excited to have Mahela Jayawardene join the Titans as head coach for the next two editions of BPL, Khulna Titans Managing Director Kazi Inam Ahmed said in a statement.
We were thrilled to see him win the IPL recently as the coach of the Mumbai Indians. I am sure all of us Titans will learn a lot from him and the tournament will be enriched by his presence Ahmed added.
Jayawardene, 39, will replace former Australia batsman Stuart Law, who has become the head coach of the West Indies national team.
I enjoyed playing in the BPL last year and that has given me a great insight into what will be required to be successful in the 2017 tournament, said Jayawardene.
The fifth edition of the BPL is set to begin November 4 with the organisers announcing the inclusion of an eighth team for the lucrative meet.
The tournament will allow five overseas players in a team's XI against the current system of maximum four foreigners in the line-up, BPL secretary Ismail Haider told reporters on Thursday.
Since BPL is telecast in different parts of the world, we have to think about the spectators and they want to see number of quality overseas players in the league, said Haider.
The BPL, modelled on India's glitzy IPL, resumed in November last year after its 2013 edition was blighted by a match-fixing scandal involving players and team owners. AFP

KOPIA provides rain shelters to onion seed farmers
The Korea Programme on International Agriculture (KOPIA) Sri Lanka Centre donated rain shelters to 80 Sri Lankan farmers in Bulnewa and Galenbindunuwewa villages, Anuradhapura recently.
The shelters, which can cover a total area of 20,000 square meters, will be used to protect onion seeds from rain during the flowering season.
The KOPIA Sri Lanka Centre is planning to hand over small-scale farming equipment and machines such as Farm Masters, Rotaries and Vinyl-Mulching Machine, to the farmers. The donation was made as part of the project, Seed Multiplication and Cropping Technology Development for Onion Production of Sri Lanka.
The Centre had provided 2 hectares of rain shelters to farmers in Galenbindunuwewa, Mannar and Hambantota under the programme during the past two years. The Centre also dispatched Korean onion experts to Sri Lanka, aimed to transfer new technology to Sri Lankan farmers and officials in the agricultural sector. They organized workshops and training programmes in this regard.The KOPIA Sri Lanka was established in December 2011 to support agricultural development in Sri Lanka by the Koreas Rural Development Administration (RDA) under the Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Ministry with the Agriculture Ministry.

Luiz happy the risk of coming 'home' paid off
Cobham:Chelsea defender David Luiz admits he took a risk leaving Paris St Germain to come 'home' but as he prepares for the FA Cup final, having already won the Premier League, it's a gamble which he believes has reaped dividends.
The 30-year-old Brazilian was a firm favourite in Paris, an established and respected part of a successful team which won back-to-back domestic 'trebles' during his two-year stay in the French capital.
That's a contrast to his first spell at Chelsea when he was heavily criticised by television pundits for the poor quality of his defending -- despite eventually being sold for a world record fee of 50million for a defender.
So, it's easy to question why he answered a call just ahead of the 2016/17 campaign to return to Stamford Bridge to a side managed by Antonio Conte who had been tasked with restoring morale after a turbulent season prior to that when they had gone from champions to finishing 10th.
His return, was hardly greeted with celebrations either -- certainly not outside of Stamford Bridge -- and instead described as a panic buy by the home media.
So Luiz can understand why many people wondered if he had made a mistake.
"I was winning in Paris. I went to Paris for two years and won all the titles in France and I had a great life," he told journalists at the club Open Day head of Saturday's final against London rivals Arsenal.
"So I have everything in Paris and then I took a risk to come back in one country that was not that happy with me.
"They always criticise me a lot even with the Champions League, Europa League, and playing all the games.
"So that's why it was a risk. And I love the risk. If you never take risks in your life you never feel something new.
"So I taste something new and I like it.
"I don't like to stay always with the easy life -- so that's why I took the risk and today I am very happy."
The contrast between the Chelsea of last season and the Antonio Conte side going for a league and cup 'double' is immense; and Luiz has been such an important par of the transformation, becoming a pivotal cog in Conte's 3-4-3 formation.

'No people's consent obtained for pre-fabricated housing project in north-east'
A group of civil society activists allege that no mechanism of informed consent was obtained from the people in the North and East for the 6,000 steel pre-fabricated housing project to be launched in the region.
At a media briefing held at the National Library Auditorium yesterday, the group asked that the project be stopped and the government instead concentrate on its already successful brick and mortar housing project.
The Cabinet recently approved a proposal to build 6,000 steel pre-fabricated houses for the war displaced in the North and East given that that recipients consent to receiving such a house. The initial proposal put forward in late 2015 was for 65,000 houses and by early 2016, it was decided that the contract would be awarded to Indian company Arcelor Mittal and to be built within four years. At the time, it was estimated that each house would be built at a cost of Rs 2.1 million but the recent Cabinet proposal has suggested that the cost of a house has been brought down to Rs 1.5 million and the numbers reduced.
The housing scheme over the last two years has come under severe criticism due its exorbitant costs, steel pre-fabricated housing not being suited to local climatic conditions, not being culturally accepted by the people and issues of durability. Given the opposition to the project, President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed the authorities to provide pre-fabricated houses to only those who want it.
The President said the people must decide but that has not been followed through, Development Worker Raga Alphonsus, who has been working in the North and East for the last 25 years, said.
Even the government officials responsible for pushing the project are unaware of what steel pre-fabricated houses are. They have just been given a form to be filled by the people and a target. The most vulnerable communities are affected by this as the government officials have told them that they might not get any house at all if they do not consent to the project.Alphonsus said.
Anthonypillai Yakob from Mannar, who had lived in a temporary shelter after being released from Camp at the end of the war, too had been given the option of a steel pre-fab house,
The Grama Sevaka asked me if I wanted one. I told him that we have no experience in such houses, so how would we know if we want one Yakob said.
He said he had instead written in the form that he would prefer a brick and mortar house though such an option was not made available in the form.
People are afraid that if they refuse this, they would not get a house at all. They are not aware of the alternatives, Yakob said.
The group of civil society members in the North and East opposing the scheme had submitted an alternative proposal to the government in May 2016 but are yet to receive a reply regarding it.
We have proposed that a brick and mortar house can be built locally with Rs 800,000 and with solar power and additional utilities it would come to Rs 1 million, activist Niyanthini Kadirgamar said.
She explained that with the USD 1 billion being awarded to Arcelor Mittal for 65,000 pre-fab houses, their proposal could build close to 102,000 houses. She said the brick and mortar houses too could be completed within four years given the funding.
There is an urgent need to provide housing and there have been many delays. Houses need to be built as soon as possible and four years seems like a realistic timescale, Alphonsus said.
According to a housing survey done by the government in 2015, there was a need for a total of 130,000 houses for the war displaced in the North and East. At present, the Resettlement, Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms Ministry and the EU have built or are working on 17,500 houses. In addition, there are 65,000 landless families who also need both housing and land.
Alphonsus said the Resettlement Ministry's current scheme of building brick and mortar houses for Rs 800,000 was a success and it did not make sense to move to pre-fab houses,
Housing is seen as a lifetime investment. Unlike steel pre-fab houses, the people have the space to expand or modify as they please with brick and mortar and it can be easily maintained. People have no sense of ownership with these pre-fab houses. It is not something they want, he said.
Kadirgamar asked, Why is the government pushing for an economically unfeasible project rejected by the people

Although the GMOA was unaware of it::
SL's Dengue Programme highly commended by WHO:Dr. Senaratne
Sri Lanka's Dengue Prevention Programme has been highly commended by the World Health Organization(WHO), although Opposition members and the Government Medical Officer's Association (GMOA) had not been able to witness them, said Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
He also pointed out that it was Sri Lanka that has a National Dengue Prevention Programme in the South Asian Region, adding that only 48 people in Sri Lanka had died in 2016 which was only 0.2 percent of the affected people. He added that there was a reduction of the deaths out of the affected people.
"We have trained two consultants to treat dengue affected patients. We sent them to Thailand as theirs was the best programme for it," Minister Senaratne said. "Those two had been attached to the Mulleriyawa Hospital and Negombo Hospital respectively."
"Changing weather conditions throughout the world have not only given rights to floods and landslides, but also to the global dengue epidemic," Minister Senaratne said. "This has turned into a global issue, while the GMOA was unaware such matters. Now they have stepped into politics rather than studying theses changes."
Minister Senaratne made these observations yesterday, in response to a special statement made by the Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena under Standing Order 23(2). He charged that there had been 45,000 cases of Dengue in Sri Lanka this year. " The statement that had been made by Health authorities that they alone could not handle the situation is a clear indication on how grave the situation had turned into," the MP said.
Minister Senaratne responding to Gunawardena, said that the US Centre for Disease Control, had sent 900 dengue alerts across the globe to date. "Out of which, 400 alerts have been sent out to countries in the Asian region," Minister Senaratne said. "Sri Lanka is also affected by the global epidemic, while South Asia is the region which is mostly hit by the disease."
The minister said that it had been found that the Dengue Virus 1 and 3 is also present in Sri Lanka at the moment. He said the worst affected age group by the disease in Sri Lanka were young adults and the aged.
The minister said a series of precautions have been taken to prevent the disease in Sri Lanka, such as carrying out constant checks on places such as schools. Further, he said a special ward has been set up at the Infectious Disease Hospital ( IDH) in Mulleriyawa and Negombo.
To purchase vehicles, renovate official residences of ministries:
Govt. submits supplementary allocation to Parliament for Rs. 369 million
A supplementary allocation was submitted by the Government yesterday seeking the approval of Parliament for a sum of about Rs 369 million to purchase vehicles for several ministries and renovate official residences of some ministries.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella presented the Supplementary allocation to the House which was referred to the Public Finance Committee for approval.
According to the allocation, approval of the House had been sought for Rs 154 million to purchase new vehicles for the Defence Ministry, Rs 120 million to purchase vehicles for the Finance Ministry, Rs 43 million to purchase a vehicle for the Rural Economy Deputy Minister and Rs 16 million to purchase a vehicle for the Development Strategies and International Trade Minister.
However, the notes of the supplementary allocation said funds are being spent for vehicles as the monies allocated for the purchase of vehicles in 2016 had not been utilized.
In addition, it also sought the approval of Parliament for Rs 3.4 million for the repairs of the official residence of Social Empowerment and Social Welfare Minister, Rs 1.2 million for the repairs of the official residence of Digital Infrastructure Development Minister, Rs 6.4 million to renovate the official residence of Childcare and Welfare Minister and Rs 5.9 million for the renovation of Central Province Governor's official residence.
It had also sought approval for Rs 124 million for Parliament to meet shortfall of provisions for personal emoluments. Moreover, Rs 1 billion has been sought to the Higher Education and Highways Ministry for the settlement of outstanding bills of road projects.
The Supplementary allocation further noted that: However, this supplementary provision does not change the approved total expenditure limits of the annual estimate by Parliament.
The allocation of such purposes had been made under the Project of Budgetary Support Services and Contingent Liabilities of the Department of National Budget and it is under the limit of the approved annual budget. Therefore, either the burrowing limit or the maximum limit of total expenditure will not be increased due to granting of these supplementary provisions.
Dinesh condemns threats, attacks against minority communities
As the Ramazan season begins, the Muslim community is engulfed in fear due to anti-Muslim violence, floods and the Dengue epidemic, MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said.
MP Gunawardena yesterday in Parliament, condemned the threats and attacks against the minority communities.
As reported, about 71 houses and properties belonging to Muslims have come under threat and attack. We in the Joint Opposition, vehemently condemn such incidents despite who are behind them. As the fasting season begins, the Muslims have faced many problems. I request the Government to pay special attention to this situation, he said.
Book making unwarranted changes to legislation::
Dy Speaker wants the book be given for Speaker's perusal
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala yesterday, asked MP Bandula Gunawardena to hand over Attorney-at-Law Kalyananda Thiranagamas book that accused Parliament of making unwarranted changes to legislation after their passage for the perusal of the Speaker.
He made this direction thwarting an attempt by Joint Opposition MP Gunawardena to table the said book in Parliament asking for an investigation over the allegations.
MP Gunawardena said the author of the book has alleged that certain officials were involved in changing the clauses of legislation after their passage in the House. MP Dullas Alahapperuma explained the allegation in the book was that certain clauses added to the 19th Amendment were not actually passed in Parliament.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said if the MP is tabling the book he should state whether he agrees or disagrees with the allegations made in it. The Deputy Speaker also maintained that tabling the book would in turn give legal recognition to it.
It is better to refer the book to the Speaker than tabling it. Then we will take necessary action in that regard, he said.
Kiriella demanded the Joint Opposition to read out any clause in the 19th Amendment which was not passed in Parliament. As the Joint Opposition could not mention any, Kiriella said the allegation was false and that there are no such clauses.
The Deputy Speaker also told Parliament that a new set of Standing Orders have been drafted and its copies would soon be circulated among all MPs to take a final decision on it.
Sittings limited to three and a half hours for MPs to assist in rescue operations
Parliamentary sittings was limited to three and half hours yesterday, enabling the members to assist in the rescue operations and distribution of relief to the victims of the severe flood situation that the country is facing.
The Party Leaders meeting headed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya called instantly in Parliament at 11.45 am after suspending the sittings temporarily, decided that the sittings should be limited until 2 pm yesterday and allow the members to go to their districts to assist the flood victims.
The decision to end sessions early was reached following the members from the government side and the opposition urged that the stiff action to help the victims of land slides and floods should be taken.
Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had given instructions to take all steps to assist the flood victims. He said that the Tri-Forces have also been instructed to help rescue the victims with boats and to provide them with relief. He also added that such a similar flood was experienced when he was the Plantation Industries Minister in 2003.
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena pointed out that quick action should be taken to provide emergency assistance to the victims of the flood that seems to be the worst flood that hit the country since 2003. He added that the President as well as the Disaster Management Minister are out of the country and Premier Wickremesinghe was to leave within a few hours.
"However, emergency assistance should be provided to people affected by the floods," MP Gunawardena said. "By this time, people in several areas are hanging on trees for protection. The Kiriella village in Ratnapura District is being inundated even at this moment while Minister Kiriella is joining in the debates. "
"All measure have already been taken to rescue the victims and to provide them relief by the tri forces, while the Disaster Management Centre had taken immediate action," Minister Kiriella said. "Boats and aircraft are provided for rescue operations."
Joint Opposition MP Dullas Alahapperuma said the Sapugoda Vihara where Ven Omare Kassapa Thera lived had gone under water, while a major bridge which connects Akuressa and Kamburupitiya has been damaged.
Government MP Buddhika Pathirana also called for action stating that several districts had already gone under water.
JVP Member Nihal Galappaththi suggested that sessions should be adjourned early, enabling MPs to go and help the victims of their respective districts.
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala who was presiding at the moment, observed that the situation would turn worse today as the rains were continuously falling heavily in many areas. He then adjourned sessions for ten minutes calling for an emergency meeting of Party Leaders. Party Leaders later decided to end sessions at 2 pm to allow the MPs to participate in rescue operations and in relief distribution. The Party leaders also decided to continue sittings without the lunch break. The sittings resumed at 12 noon.
Conspiracy to withhold results of 2015 elections::The two ministries passing the buck, says Gammanpila
The Justice Ministry and Law and Order Ministry are passing the buck over a complaint made to the CID regarding a conspiracy to withhold the results of the Presidential Election on the night of January 8, 2015, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila said.
The MP made this observation in Parliament yesterday, following a reply by Justice Deputy Minister Sarathi Dushmantha Mithrapala on the progress of the above mentioned complaint.
The Deputy Minister told Parliament that the Attorney Generals Department received a CID report in this regard in February 2015, but it has requested further details pertaining to the case to determine whether there was enough evidence to file a criminal charge. The Department is yet to receive that additional information, he said.
MP Gammanpila pointed out that when he asked the same question from Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratanayake in Parliament, he replied that the CID was waiting for legal advice from the AGs Department. Both parties are passing the buck. This complaint was made by Minister Mangala Samaraweera and I was the first suspect in it. The complaint was related to national security. The way this complaint is handled makes us question the state of national security in the country, he said.
The Deputy Minister said that investigations have not been stalled and it would be carried forward once the required information is received.

The ruling UNP-SLFP coalition will soon set up a joint mechanism comprising officials of the government as well as the Northern Provincial Council to accelerate Northern Province development. Northern Province consists of Jaffna, Mannar, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya and Mulathivu administrative districts. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe announced government plans in Jaffna after having met Jaffna District peoples representatives and officials.
The announcement was made at a joint media briefing given by PM Wickremesinghe and Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran. In addition to the joint mechanism, there would be a committee consisting of Northern Province Provincial Council ministers, Jaffna district parliamentarians and ministers, Wickremesinghe said.
Social Market Economy
In the mean time government sources said The Government plans to create a competitive Social Market Economy that will give everyone the opportunity to create wealth. Our efforts to overcome the debt burden left to us by the previous Government and our efforts at empowering the economy have been commended and supported by the international community. We are setting the stage for Sri Lankan companies engaged in sectors such as agricultural, industrial and services, to be able to compete successfully in the global market while securing the inclusion of Sri Lanka in the Global Value Chain. For centuries, Sri Lanka has been the heart of the Indian Ocean.
Sri Lanka was the hub that connected eastern and western Asia; accordingly, Sri Lankas capacity to become the economic and shipping hub of the region is imperative. Against such a background, we have the challenging task of developing mechanisms towards achieving sustainable development. Undoubtedly, it is no cakewalk  rather, it is a formidable task that must be undertaken with vision and foresight. In order for us to emerge as a prosperous nation, free of poverty and backward thinking, we must be able to encourage and foster foreign investment, which will fuel the developmental process. We plan to make Sri Lanka an export driven economic hub of the region, enabling connectivity with the region and the world via a highly developed network of ports and airports. We are committed to encouraging local and global investors to enhance the level of investments in Sri Lanka; as a result of the short sighted economic policies of the previous government, the country had to take on a very heavy burden of debt while investments tapered off at the time. We can only overcome the economic hurdles by obtaining a greater share of the market for our products and services via free trade agreements with other countries.
While we hear the optimistic estimations from economic development front there are problems in the politics of national unification. President Sirisena addressing the nation at the National War Heroes Memorial Ceremony 2017 at the Parliament Grounds said that Sri Lanka was unprepared for a separatist terrorism when trouble started in the mid 70s. There was smooth running of the country sans any significant economic or national security hiccups until 1970 after gaining independence in 1948. Though there were occasional failures and setbacks, our armed forces, the Police and Civil Defence Force fought the separatist war bravely and with utmost dedication and resolve until the final victory. Even about 100,000 Indian soldiers of the Indian Peace Keeping Force were not able to contain the LTTE terrorists. However, the sons and daughters of the three armed forces and the Police of the motherland were able to annihilate the separatist terrorism from its soil forever by using their experience in the war, strategies and knowledge combined with technological acumen, President Sirisena said.
Fight against terrorism
They faced many a hardship, threats and difficulties in their fight against terrorism. Hundreds of thousands of heroic soldiers made the supreme sacrifice in the war front on behalf of the motherland. Many others lost their limbs in the war and today they live as disabled soldiers in their own homes of welfare centres maintained by the armed forces. The number of civilians and armed forces personnel and members of the Police and Civil Defence Force who became victims of terrorist exceeds 100,000.
There were soldiers who were killed by the terrorists directly and innocent civilians who perished to bomb attacks in towns and villages in remote areas that were the targets of the LTTE. President Sirisena said incumbent government under him as well as the previous government for the last eight years had done much for the welfare of the soldiers and Police personnel as well as families.
During the period of the previous government May 18 became a day of tension in the North. The previous government too, celebrated the war victory over the LTTE in the South of the country. However Mahinda regime prohibited any public memorial services for those who died in the last battles in the North. This time too, there was a report that police in the North had obtained a court order to put on hold a commemoration event in Mullivaikkal scheduled for May 18. This took the centre stage of public attention in the North.
It appeared that the prohibition was for all commemoration services for the victims of the war and with that the past had returned to haunt the present. However, the court order was only with regard to a single commemorative event and was not a general directive that prohibited all commemorative activities. There were many commemorations organised by political parties and civil society groups in the North and East.
Some media reports said that families of the victims and the church groups had defied the ban and held commemorations. Even the blocked event was later permitted to be held in a church, though not on the last battleground of Mullivaikkal as originally planned. The biggest event in Mullivaikkal, which had been organised by civil society and political parties and which was attended by TNA leader R Sampanthan and Northern Chief Minister C V Wigneswaran. This event attracted the most public attention as TNA leader Sampanthan was heckled by some of the participants as he spoke.
Propose alternatives
This incident took over the centre stage of public attention. Both the court order halting a commemoration event at Mullivaikkal and the heckling of the TNA leader points to the level of democracy in the country. On the one hand, it shows the political space that has opened up which enables people in different parts of the country, and from different classes, to publicly express their dissent. Whether in the North or South those who protest are feeling increasingly emboldened to challenge those in authority and to propose alternatives.
Still, there is a serious challenge to Lankan state that commemorates the victory without mentioning the defeated. After all, those involved in the conflict were citizens of this country; whether belonged to the Sinhala nationality or the Tamil nationality; all were children of this country  Lanka. If there are heroes on the Sinhala side there should be more heroes on the defeated Tamil side. Depressed and humiliated, if Tamils yearned for a country of their own, free and independent; it is a problem that should be solved by the sympathetic participation of the majority community. If not it will lead again and again to the liberation struggle of the Tamil people.
Defeat of Tamil liberation is a void, unless serious attempt to unite the country with power sharing is done; it has to include a substantial autonomy with the right of self determination. At least, are we serious about a new constitution with Police and Land Powers to Provincial Councils

Ramadan and its significance
Millions of Muslims around the world begin fasting this month. Holy month of Ramadan starts this month on 27th or 28th which depends on the sighting of the crescent moon. Ramadan is the ninth month in the Islamic calendar or Hijri calendar based on the lunar cycle, which begins in 622 AD when beloved Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) migrated from the holy city of Makkah to Madina.
Nearly 1.6 billion Muslims in the world believe Ramadan is the holiest month in the year because the Quran, the holy book of Islam was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) in this month. Muslims around the world are preparing for the Islamic holy month of Ramadan after having a meal in the early hours before Fajr prayers early in the morning and keep fasting without any bite or sip of water until the Maghrib prayers at sunset. It continues either 29 or 30 days in a lunar month.
When the holy month of Ramadan begins worldwide, countries across the globe face different fasting hours. According to the latest maps, the Muslims in Denmark are observing longest fast in the world; it is around 21 hours of fasting. Iceland, Sweden and Norway are the countries with second longest hours of fasting at 20 hours. The Muslims in England also observe one of the longest fasts varying from 18 to 19 hours. Asian countries such as Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka observe fasting 14 to 16 hours. Shortest fast is being observed in Argentina and Australia where fasting does not exceed 10 hours.
Basically the countries in the Arctic Circle observe longest fasting hours. Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, the United States (Alaska), Canada, Denmark (Greenland), and Iceland are in the Arctic Circle.
Why do Muslims fast
Fasting or Sawm in Arabic, literally means to refrain is one of the five pillars of Islam. The other pillars are the Shahadah which is declaration of faith; Salath is the five time prayers; Zakath is giving alms to poor and needy and the Haj is pilgrimage to Holy city of Makkah. Fasting in the month of Ramadan is obligatory for Muslims as mentioned in the Holy Quran - the book which contains the message of Almighty Allah that gives guidance for all humanity. Holy Quran says, O you who believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous (Sura Al-Baqarah, 2:183). It further says, whoever sights (the moon of the month) the month of Ramadan, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey, then an equal number of other days. Almighrty Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and (wants) for you to complete the period and to glorify Allah for that (to) which He has guided you; and perhaps you will be grateful (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2;185).
Lailathul Qadr- the night of power in the last ten days of the month of Ramadan is a significant day for Muslims in which the Noble Quran was revealed to prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Muslims spend this night in prayers and meditation. This night carries more blessings than a thousand months (Sura Al-Qadr, 97:1-5).
Fasting is not only abstaining food, drink and other pleasurable activities, but also refrains backbiting - talking bad things about others when they are not presence, using foul languages.
Fasting does not mean Muslims retreat from their daily routine. They are encouraged to continue their normal work and usual activities in their day-to-day life. In fact, this is where the challenge of patience and endurance comes in. Muslims believe fasting is not merely a physical ritual, but is primarily a time for reflection and spiritual recharging.
The holy month of Ramadan is also a time of community. Muslims invite their neighbours and friends whoever Muslims or non-Muslims to share their evening meal with them at Iftar -the time of breaking fast. In the night, Muslims perform special prayers such as Taraweeh and Withr in congregation as a community.
According to Islamic teachings, every healthy Muslim men and women are required to fast during the month of Ramadan after the age of puberty. Children, people who are sick or who have mental illnesses, travellers, women who are menstruating, postnatal, pregnant or breast-feeding do not have to fast.
How do Muslims fast in countries where no sunset
Wherever the Muslims live, it is obligatory to observe fasting after sighting the moon in the month of Ramadan. But, there are countries where the sun remains visible at midnight in the Arctic Circle, and in northernmost Finland, the sun does not set at all for 60 days during summer. According to the Fatwa- the rules given by the scholars in the Islamic point of view, in places where it is not possible to see the crescent moon, the Muslims may begin fasting according to the closest place where the moon has been sighted or they can rely on the calculations of astronomers whom experts in Astronomy. As a result, some scholars have said it is permissible to follow more reasonable dawn and sunset times of another closest country.
The Islamic Centre of Northern Norway, issued a fatwa  a ruling by a scholar of Islamic law or Muslim judicial authority  that gives local Muslims the option of following the fasting hours of Mecca, when the fasting day in Norway exceeds 20 hours.
The Assembly of Muslim Jurists of America made a similar ruling that Muslims living in the most northerly regions of Alaska can use the dawn and sunset times of another part of the country where day is distinguishable from night.
Medical aspects of fasting
Fasting can have a number of health benefits, as well as potentially helping overweight people. During fasting, the body uses up glucose and then starts to burn fat, this can lead to weight loss. Dr Razeen Mahroof, an anaesthetist from Oxford, says Ramadan is not always thought of being an opportunity to lose weight because the spiritual aspect is emphasised more generally than health aspect. However, there is a strong relationship between diet and health and its a great chance to get the physical benefits as well. In his statement to the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK a detoxification process also occurs, because any toxins stored in the bodys fat are dissolved and removed from the body.
In another report issued by the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK says, after a few days of the fast, higher levels of endorphins  hormones related to mood  appear in the blood and can make a person more alert and give an overall feeling of general mental wellbeing.
A Swiss physician Dr. Barsilus says the advantages of hunger as a remedy exceed those ingesting medicine several times.
The physiological effect of fasting includes lowering of blood sugar, lowering of cholesterol and lowering of the systolic blood pressure. In fact, Ramadan fasting would be an ideal recommendation for the treatment of mild to moderate, stable, non-insulin diabetes, obesity, and essential hypertension. Following a drop in blood sugar level and using the reserves of glucose found in liver glycogen. Hence, during fast body uses the glucose stored up in the liver glycogen and reduces the sugar level in the body. This is a very effective and natural treatment method for people suffering from diabetes.
Spiritual aspects
Fasting in the month of Ramadan, allows one to build a sense of self-control and will power, which can be beneficial throughout life in dealing with temptations and peer pressure. Muslims learn to control their natural urges such as hunger and thirst through fasting. And also it helps to resist temptations for thing that are not necessary, such as drugs or other harmful substances to the health.
Especially fasting teaches the human beings to purify their bodies as well as their souls by developing a greater sense of humility and spirituality. It teaches a greater sense of generosity and forgiveness. Fasting develops feelings of generosity and good-will toward others. Fasting also teaches self-control or restraint, good manners, good habits.
A person who doesn't have control over himself is always caught in inferiority complex phobia. A person who cannot control himself can never develop leadership qualities. Fasting is an effective method to develop self-control and hence build our character.
Learning to refrain from eating and drinking even when there is a desire for it is all a practice of self-control.
Peace and tranquillity
Ramadan teaches peace and tranquillity. Those who observe fast during the month of Ramadan get practice to maintain peace and tranquillity in their whole life avoiding personal hostility.
When we remain thirsty and hungry in Ramadan the we experience the affliction that the poor and needy people of the society experience the whole year. Hence, fasting is a way of bridging the gap between the different classes and in and out groups in the society.

Sangakkara (177 n.o) rescues Surrey with 99th hundred of career
Sri Lanka cricket legend Kumar Sangakkara continued to set fire to the English county grounds when he rescued Surrey with a century against Division One leaders Essex on the opening day of their County Championship match at Chelmsford on Friday.
Sangakkara came into this match with an already remarkable record in the County Championship: in six innings he had one fifty and four hundreds.
In his seventh match of the season, he scored an unbeaten 177 off 276 balls (23 fours) in a game where every other recognised Surrey batsman struggled.
It was a fifth consecutive Championship hundred for Sangakkara and another master class innings that saw Surrey finish the day at 334-7.
Alongside Sam Curran, the former Sri Lanka captain steadied the Surrey innings after the visitors found themselves 31-5 an hour before lunch.
Sangakkara and Curran played extremely well on a pitch that got better and better for batting.
The partnership was worth 191 when Curran was dismissed for 90.
Sangakkaras innings was not without blemish. The Sri Lankan reached his 50 with a four, his eighth when former England captain Alastair Cook dropped him at first slip off Neil Wagner when he induced a leading edge.
When Sangakkara reached his century it was his fifth straight in the County Championship this season, his 99th of his career and his 61st in first-class cricket.
The Surrey batsman was rewarded for sticking in there when the going was tough earlier and he made hay when the sun shone at Chelmsford.
Scores: Surrey 334-7 at close (Kumar Sangakkara 177 n.o., Sam Curran 90, S Meaker 43 n.o., J Porter 2/70, M Quinn 3/66) v Essex.

Seven decades of friendship
President Maithripala Sirisenas State visit to Australia is highly significant for several reasons. It is the first State visit by a Sri Lankan Head of State to Australia in several decades and follows visits by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe back in February this year, former Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera (April 2016) and State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene (October 2016).
President Sirisena's visit will be an opportunity to advance key areas of bilateral cooperation, including education, defense, science and technology, economic development, medical research and the fight against people smuggling, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a statement. The two leaders held bilateral discussions on these and several other issues.
The visit marks the 70th anniversary of Australia-Sri Lanka relations, which began in January 1947, even before Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) gained independence from the British. Both countries share the British colonial legacy and are now members of the British Commonwealth. Sri Lankas High Commission in Canberra was opened in 1949 and the countrys first Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake visited Australia in 1951, followed by Prime Minister Sir John Kotelawala in 1954. Several Australian Prime Ministers including Sir Robert Menzies, Gough Whitlam and Tony Abbott have visited Sri Lanka.
Ties between the two countries have always been excellent, regardless of which party was in power in either country. In fact, even when the rest of the Western world poured scorn on Sri Lanka due to HR issues after the conflict ended in 2009, Australia took a more enlightened and accommodating view whilst expressing its own concerns to the Sri Lankan Government of the day.
The Australia-Sri Lanka bilateral relationship is important in so many ways. Sri Lankans numbering close to 90,000 form the 12th largest expatriate group in Australia. Both Sinhala and Tamil are widely spoken in Australian cities. Sri Lankan Australians have contributed in numerous ways to enhance the Australian socio-economic and cultural fabric. They also regularly visit Sri Lanka and remit funds to family and relatives back home, thus contributing to the Lankan economy as well. Hundreds of Sri Lankan families legally migrate to Australia every year.
Trade has also become a pivotal issue for the two countries. In 2015, trade between the two nations exceeded A$ 950 million. There is potential for a significant increase in Australian trade and investment, which the President has explored during his tour. Tourism is another key sector - Sri Lanka is Australias 25th largest tourist destination. Australian tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka have grown by 12.7 per cent over the past five years. The number of tourists to Australia from Sri Lanka has also increased by 10.4 per cent since 2010. The recommencement of SriLankan Airlines direct flights to Melbourne from Colombo is likely to boost these numbers and enhance people to people contact.
There is another very strong bond that unites the two countries - cricket. Ever since Sri Lanka emerged victorious over Australia at the Cricket World Cup Final in Lahore, Pakistan in 1996, the cricket rivalry between the two countries has intensified and from Australias point of view, second only to its rivalry with England. Lets hope that the two sides will meet for a scintillating match in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy 2017 in England (Sri Lanka and Australia are in separate preliminary groups).
But there is more. The two nations share the same democratic structures and values as well as the English language. The strong relationship is founded on a shared history of cooperation in areas such as education (dating back to the Colombo Plan of the 1950s), trade and investment, culture and development and links through the Commonwealth.
There was another issue that led to some tension a few years earlier. People smugglers operated a ring that smuggled mostly economic migrants from Sri Lanka and other Asian and African countries to Australia. However, the Australian and Sri Lankan Governments worked closely with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the two Navies to resolve this issue. No Sri Lankan asylum seeker has reached Australia by boat since 2013 but Sri Lankans, Iranians and Afghans are the largest national groups among more than 2,000 asylum seekers who are kept on the Pacific island nations of Nauru and Papua New Guinea by Australian authorities.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has assured that the Sri Lankans held in Pacific island camps were free to return home without any fear of persecution. The Presidents discussions with Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Peter Dutton focused on this issue.
The two Governments should perhaps study and explore the Korean solution to provide a number of opportunities for youth to work legally in Australia with or without the final prospect of legal migration. In the early 1990s when it was found that some Sri Lankan youth were trying to leave for jobs in South Korea illegally, the South Korean Government stepped in and offered a quota of jobs for Lankan youth through a programme that continues to this day. Such a beneficial programme will take the Australia-Sri Lanka relationship to new heights.

Sharapova's Wimbledon qualifying bid to be broadcast
LONDON May26: Fans around the world will be able to watch Maria Sharapova's bid to reach Wimbledon with qualifying for the Grand Slam to be broadcast for the first time, it was announced Friday.
However, a spokeswoman for the All England Lawn Tennis Club, the tournament organisers, told AFP in London that this was one of several long-planned changes and not a decision made in response to 2004 Wimbledon singles champion Sharapova's move to take part in qualifying rather than accept a wildcard as she returns from a doping ban.
An AELTC statement said it wanted to continually improve the facilities for both competitors and spectators at the Bank of England sports centre in Roehampton, near Wimbledon in southwest London, which has hosted qualifying uninterrupted since 1947. For the first time, television coverage from the event's main Show Court will be available to spectators inside the Grounds via a giant video screen, and to Wimbledon fans around the world on wimbledon.com and via the AELTC's broadcast partners, the statement said.
The AELTC added that this year's enhancements also included the introduction of ticketing, to allow for adequate and appropriate security and safety measures at the venue.
Russian former world number one Sharapova was refused a wildcard for the French Open, another of tennis's four Grand Slams that starts this weekend following her 15-month ban for taking meldonium.
However, the 30-year-old was controversially handed a wildcard for next month's WTA grasscourt event in Birmingham, a key warm-up for Wimbledon.
Sharapova returned from her doping ban on April 26 but relied on wildcards to get into tournaments because her world ranking points expired while she was banned. The five-time Grand Slam winner had plummeted to 211.
She was initially banned for two years for using meldonium, with the penalty later reduced by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which ruled she was not an intentional doper. AFP

Sri Lanka lose to Australia in close game
LONDON, Friday: Half-centuries from skipper Angelo Mathews (95) and Asela Gunaratne (70) coupled with a splendid spell of fast bowling from Nuwan Pradeep (3/57) was not enough for Sri Lanka who lost a close ICC Champions trophy warm-up match to Australia by two wickets with 2 balls to spare at the Oval on Friday.
Invited to bat first Sri Lanka put up a challenging score of 318-7, but Aaron Finch with a superb 137 off 109 balls and Travis Head 85 not out off 73 balls (7 fours) steered Australia to a nerve-tingling two win.
Sri Lanka lost their first four wickets for 92 by the 17th over before Mathews with the help of Chamara Kapugedera (30) staged the first of three recovery partnerships.
The pair added 60 for the fifth wicket before Kapugedera was dismissed. Mathews joined by Gunaratne carried the Sri Lanka total to 243 when the Lankan captain was out five short of a well deserved century. His 106-ball innings comprised nine fours and two sixes.
Gunaratne however continued undeterred by the loss of his captain and produced the best partnership of the innings with Seekkuge Prasanna.
The pair raced to 70 off 37 balls carrying the Sri Lanka total beyond the 300-run mark.
Prasanna slammed three sixes and one four in his cameo knock of 31 off 19 balls and Gunaratne was equal to the task making a brilliant 70 off 56 balls with eight fours and two sixes.
Pick of the Aussie bowlers was Moises Henriques with 3 for 46.
Aaron Finch launched Australias run chase in blistering fashion posting 64 off 68 balls for the first wicket with David Warner whose contribution in the partnership was only 19. Australia were cruising at 218-3 with Finch having posted a superb century reaching it with a six off Gunaratne off 76 balls.
However a bowling change that saw Nuwan Pradeep into the attack changed the Australian tempo and brought Sri Lanka back into the game.
Pradeep produced a fine 36th over by dismissing the in form Finch for 137 off 109 balls (11 fours, 6 sixes) and the dangerous Glenn Maxwell for a first ball duck.
Lasith Malinga whose first six overs cost only 20 runs returned to the attack to get rid of Mathew Wade for 13 to reduce Australia to 242-6 in the 40th over.

Taming a President
President Donald Trump swept into power with an ultra-nationalist agenda. He vowed to make America great, shun alliances and pursue an America First policy. He wanted to build a wall on the US-Mexican border, stop or minimize immigration, charge allies for upkeep of NATO forces and many more policies of similar vein.
He did in fact begin implementing his election promises. He proposed to charge the Mexican government half the cost of building the boundary wall separating the US from Mexico. But the Mexican government outright rejected the proposal. He imposed a travel ban on a group of Muslim majority countries. However, the Supreme Court shot it down. He vowed to conduct a trade war with China and his election campaign was full of anti-China tirades. Now he has retreated diplomatically from that position and considers the Chinese President a close ally.
On North Korea too he beat a hasty retreat after sending a US aircraft-carrier to the Korean Sea and is now ready to have direct talks with the North Korean regime.
He persistently stood firm only on one issue, viz., that of annulling Obamacare or Health Insurance. After several attempts he did manage to get a narrow win in the US Congress. Yet the Senate approval is not a foregone conclusion. In any case it is doubtful whether he would be able to overturn the benefits of Obamacare. Senate Republicans are mulling a new version of healthcare which would actually deprive millions of health insurance. It is estimated that over 24 million would lose health insurance over the next decade. In 2018 alone 14 million would lose those benefits.
On NATO Trump told his voters that it is obsolete and castigated US allies for not contributing enough for its maintenance. Now he is meeting NATO leaders at a summit and has recognized its necessity.
As soon as he assumed the Presidency Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister and at a meeting with him he expressed his wish to shift the US Embassy in Palestine to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. However, he later postponed the move. He also distanced himself from the two-state solution, from which position too he has now distanced himself.
During his election campaign Trump promised to cancel United States commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement in which 200 nations promised to limit their Green House gases in order to prevent global temperature rising above 1.5 0 C above the pre-industrial level. Yet after meeting Pope Francis the US Foreign Secretary said that no final decision has been made on withdrawing from the Paris Agreement.
In a sense it seems that President Trump has been tamed somewhat. Why It is because the real rulers in Washington are not the elected leaders but Wall Street and the military-industrial complex controlled by them. Just look at Trumps trusted advisors and Secretaries. Gary Cohn, top Economic advisor is a former Goldman Sachs President. Steve Munchin, Treasury Secretary is also a long time Goldman Sachs partner and top executive. Wilbur Ross, Commerce Secretary is a billionaire investor. Jared Kushner, Trumps son-in-law and a Presidential Advisor is a hedge fund financier.
It is only on the last day that Trump administration unveiled a plan for asset recycling  an infrastructure plan under which state assets such as profit-making airports, Roads, etc. would be leased or sold to the private sector and the federal government would pay a bonus to such state organs that oblige. Ultimately Wall Street would run all profit making concerns leaving the public sector with less profit-friendly ones.
Manchester blast: US accused of interfering in investigations
British authorities investigating the terrorist attack in Manchester, in which 22 persons including children died and over 50 persons were injured, have complained that United States intelligence officials have leaked to the media sensitive information that would compromise their investigations.
British authorities who identified the attacker quickly decided to keep it a secret and move quickly to rope- in his network of contact and action. However, the US media broadcasted information about the perpetrators of the Act including visual productions thus making the ISIS and accomplices of the crime privy to sensitive information including possible evidence against them and giving them an opportunity to thwart investigations.
The British media reported: that Under the Five Eyes agreement, a huge quantity of signals intelligence is automatically shared among the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K. on the understanding that the secrecy is respected and maintained by all governments.
Even beyond that, the U.K. and U.S. have perhaps the worlds closest intelligence-sharing relationshiprelying on one another for assistance on tracking down bad actors and their accomplices scattered across global terror networks.
The breach of trust was so heavy that British Home Secretary openly criticized US intelligence officials in public. Even the Counter Terrorism Unit of the British Police issued a statement that such breach of trust undermines these relationships, and undermines our investigations and the confidence of victims, witnesses and their families."
Citizens Revolution consolidates in Ecuador
Lenin Moreno who won at the elections on April 2 was sworn-in as President of Ecuador May 24. A candidate of the Movimento Alianza de PAIS (Movement for the Alliance for Peace), he was the former Vice-President under President Rafael Correa. His victory marks a resurgence of the leftward shift of power in the Continent of America following the victory of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. It is a break in the reverse process that was registered in some other Latin American countries with the active assistance of the United States.
President Correa was able to defeat two attempted conspiracies to topple his regime. Under Correa Ecuador has recorded impressive gains in redistributing national wealth in favour of the have nots. For example, minimum wage has increased from US $ 170 to US$ 375 during the last ten years. During the same period poverty was reduced from 61 percent to 35 percent lifting 2 million out of poverty. Today Ecuador uses almost 90 percent of its energy requirements from renewable sources.

Young talent to watch out for at Champions Trophy 2017
The countdown is well and truly underway, with the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 starting on June 1 in England and Wales. As the top eight One-Day International sides battle it out for the prestigious title, heres a look at some of the young stars expected to stamp their authority.
Kagiso Rabada (South Africa)
Kagiso Rabada is just 21, but hes already made his mark on the international circuit. His ability to swing the ball at great pace, his accuracy with the yorkers, and his well-directed bouncers make him one of the vital cogs of the South African bowling attack.
Rabada first came into prominence during the ICC Under-19 World Cup 2014, when he returned figures of 6 for 25 against Australia in the semifinal. He ended up as the second highest wicket-taker, with 14 wickets from five matches.
He has become the go-to bowler for his country in recent times, following his ODI debut in 2015. His returns of 6 for 16 against Bangladesh are the best ever by any bowler on debut, during which he became only the second man in history to claim a hat-trick on debut, after Taijul Islam. Ever since, Rabada has become South Africa's frontline bowler, the leader of the pace attack.
Mitchell Santner (New Zealand)
Mitchell Santner, the left-handed all-rounder, has established himself as an integral part of the New Zealand side across formats. The 25-year-old made his international debut in 2015, stepping out of the shadow of Daniel Vettori following the latters retirement.
Since then, the left-arm spinner who is also a more than competent left-hand batsman has gone on to play 15 Tests, 32 ODIs and 14 T20 Internationals. It was his performances during the ICC World T20 2016 that boosted his reputation significantly. After making 126 for 7 off their 20 overs in their opening game in Nagpur, New Zealand bowled out India for just 79 in 18.1 overs, courtesy Santner's career-best T20 figures of 4 for 11.
He has since made rapid strides, mastering the subtleties of his art, both with the ball and the bat. He has been a formidable strike option for the team with his left-arm spin and his ability to hit the ball long can be a useful asset for New Zealand.
Babar Azam (Pakistan)
Coming from a family of cricketers, Babar Azam made his international debut when Zimbabwe visited Pakistan in 2015, scoring 54 off 60 balls in front of his home crowd in Lahore.
By then, he had already captained Pakistan in the ICC Under-19 World Cup 2012 and finished as the leading run-scorer for his team with 287 runs from six matches at an average of 57.40. He became one of the fastest to complete 1,000 ODI runs, alongside Sir Vivian Richards, Kevin Pietersen, Jonathan Trott and Quinton de Kock.
His ODI career received a major boost in 2016 when, in the series against West Indies in the UAE, he notched up three consecutive centuries, helping his side to a clean sweep. He was named the Man of the Series after winning the Man of the Match award in all three ODIs. Azam went past de Kock's tally of most runs in a bilateral series of three matches, scoring 360 runs.
Mustafizur Rahman (Bangladesh)
There is something special about this left-arm quick. He belongs to the generation to look forward to, and has already made a name for himself, Bangladesh have found a real gem in Mustafizur Rahman, quick, accurate and crafty with his off-cutters.
The highlight of Rahman's ODI career remain two five-wicket hauls in Bangladesh's first ever series win over India in 2015. He is only the second player to have returned five-fors in his first two ODIs, after Zimbabwe's Brian Vitori.
The 21-year-old has a lot of cricket left in him. Provided he stays fit and injury-free, he has a lot of time to grow and showcase his skills. On the balance of form combined with current potential, Rahman is seemingly one who can be tipped for bigger things.
Kusal Mendis (Sri Lanka)
Kusal Mendis is no longer a rookie, having made his Test debut for Sri Lanka against West Indies in 2015 in Colombo. His international career took off when he scored 176 against Australia, the second highest maiden Test century by a Sri Lankan batsman after Brendon Kuruppu's 201* in 1987 against New Zealand.
Ever since Kumar Sangakkara's retirement in 2015, Sri Lanka had experimented with many options at the No. 3 slot. They seem to have finally found the answer, with Mendis slotting in as a reliable one-drop batsman.
Mendis has shown flashes of brilliance in the 50-over format where, in 25 matches, he has scored 845 runs, averaging 36.73. His best was 102 from 107 deliveries against Bangladesh early this year. While the match was rained out, Mendis showed that he can adapt to the demands of the shorter versions as well, and that he is equipped to meet the demands of the crucial spot in the batting order.
Jasprit Bumrah (India)
While the yorker is his most potent weapon, Bumrahs unusual bowling action makes it very difficult for batsmen to pick him. The 23-year-old made his international debut in 2016 against Australia, taking six wickets in three T20Is after having started his career promisingly in the preceding ODI. MS Dhoni called him the find of the series'. Since then, Bumrah has surged ahead in his career.
In the world of white-ball cricket, Bumrah has the ability to outsmart the opposition batting. While he is yet to master the new ball, he has come to make a name of himself as a high-quality death-overs bowler with his pin-point Yorkers, brilliantly disguised slower deliveries, and skiddy pace with a bit of nip that makes him a very dangerous proposition. He is now considered as India's most reliable and potent death-overs specialist.
Pat Cummins (Australia)
Australia boast the kind of fast-bowling depth that other countries must be covetous of. The presence of a top-quality pace quartet comprising Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, James Pattinson and Pat Cummins makes them one of the favourites for the tournament. Cummins in as exciting as they come. He made his ODI debut against South Africa in October 2011, picking up three wickets, and his best ODI figures came in December 2016, during the second ODI of the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy when he took 4 for 41 and helped Australia to a massive 116-run win.
His career has been severely blighted by injuries, keeping him off the field more often than on it. He started 2017 on a high as he returned to Test cricket six years after making his debut, bowling with considerable pace and claiming eight wickets at an average of 30.25 in India.
Sam Billings (England)
Sam Billings was recently given the added responsibility of keeping wicket in the two-match ODI series against Ireland, showcasing another string in his bow. Billings is one of several explosive young batsmen in a restructured England line-up, capable of hitting the ball a long way without sacrificing flair or orthodoxy.
In 11 ODI matches so far, he has averaged 27.33 and scored 246 runs, numbers that are bound to improve with time. The Champions Trophy could prove to be a massive platform for the 25-year-old to showcase his talent and seal a permanent berth.
England have transformed their white-ball cricket since crashing out in the first round of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015, emerging as an aggressive and fearless team. Billings is bound to add to that reputation.  ICC news
