Seevali Samarasekera was an outstanding ruggerite
Former Trinity skipper Seevali Samarasekera, (better known as Sam) first came into limelight when he scored a match winning try for Trinity against Royal in 1969 in the Bradby Shield Rugger match played at Longdon Place, Colombo. He made a 50 yard sizling run beating a host of defenders to get that match winning try. In the same year he was invited by Kandy Coach Denzil Kobbekaduwa to play for Kandy against Havelocks which consisted of players like Glen Vanlangenberg, Japana Jayawardena, Jeff and Dan Rutnam, Mark Sunderalingam, Tyronne Holdenbottle, Jeyer Rodriguesz, Royden de Silva, Gogi Tillekeratne and Mazahir Sourjah a virtual national team. Sam scored the only try after receiving a pass from No. 8 Gamini Udugama to beat Havelocks 11-8 In the Clifford Cup semi Finals which enabled them to come to the finals. Kandy lost to CR and FC 6-12 in the finals. He captained Trinity in 1970 in which year they won both Bradby Shield matches against Royal by 19-3 and 16-12.
Sam was selected to the Sri Lanka team under Hadji Omar along with players like Y. C. Chang, Didacus de Almeida, Anton Benedict, Daya Jayasundera to name a few. He played as Centre against Bosuns and Paris University. He played Club Rugby for almost a decade and was known for his scorching runs and terrific Tackles. He was a tower of strength to all the sides he played and a master when it comes to tactics and statistics.
He said that he learnt a lot from his Coaches, Denzil Kobbekaduwa, Kavan Rambukwella, Mohan Sahayam and Maurice Perera. He was all praise for players like Anton Benedict, Didacus de Almeida, Charles Wijewardena, Daya Jayasundera, Michael Jayasekera, Y. C. Chang, Priyantha Ekanayake, Nalaka Weerakkody and Indrajith Bandaranayake.
Sam was in the Police as Sub Inspector from 1972 to 1977 and was in the Clifford cup winning team for a number of years. After leaving Police he joined Kandy Sports Club again in 1978 and played for Kandy SC under Irwin Howie in the presidents Trophy final against Havelcoks which they lost 4-10. He wishes both Royal and Trinity teams best of luck for this years Bradby Shield return match on May 14.

Question quality of candidates sent to House

Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said it was time the civil society questioned the quality of candidates the people vote into Parliament.
"It is not only political parties which need to take responsibility for such behaviour, the civil society too should question their public representatives. In other countries when politicians dont perform or break the rules, the civil society brings down pressure upon them to resign or to be held accountable, Minister Samarasinghe said.
He was addressed a media briefing at the Government Information Department today.
Samarasinghe added that the governments move to introduce the Right to Information Bill was a strong move to strengthen civil society and to give them the opportunity to get information on how Parliament and government at every level works.
This is a sustainable measure to hold public officials accountable, the minister said. Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Minister Chandima Weerakkody said the SLFP Central Working Committee would decide on any action that needs to be taken against MP Prasanna Ranaweera when it convenes at a later date.
Ranaweera is one of the two held responsible for the brawl in Parliament on Tuesday.
Weerakkody also remarked that the SLFP May Day rally in Galle was the most successful in the recent past and it showed that in the end the people stuck with the party and proved the Joint Opposition wrong.
He added that they hoped to take this opportunity to create a clean party, and then join with the UPFA to clean that up too, thus moving towards cleaner politics in the country.

Tense situation in House after wrong counting of vote on Supplementary Estimate
A tense situation prevailed during the last few minutes in Parliament yesterday when Joint Opposition and JVP members claimed the results of vote on the Supplementary Estimate of Rs. 55 million were incorrect.
Declaring the results, presiding member Lucky Jayawardena said 33 voted for while 31 voted against. However, after scrutinsing CCTV camera footage, it was decided that the result was incorrect. According to the investigation, 31 had voted for and 31 had voted against. Due to this situation, the vote would have to be taken up some other day.
The debate on the Supplementary Estimate commenced at 10.00 a.m. and lasted until 6.00 p.m.
At 5.45 p.m. JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake asked for a division and the quorum bell was rung for five minutes. Once the vote was about to be completed some members were heard saying a few other members had come to the House and needed them to be counted. They were also added and the decision was declared. However, when the decision was declared, Joint Opposition and JVP member shouted in protest of the results alleging it was incorrect. Some were seen walking into the Well of the House.
Meanwhile, presiding member Lucky Jayawardena adjourned Parliament until 9.30 a.m. today and ordered the Mace be taken away. It was taken away by Sergeant-at-Arms Anil Parakrama Samarasekara. Around 30 Joint Opposition and government members walked into the Well. Some members returned to their seats. Government and Opposition members were seen speaking to each other in the Well. However, a considerable number of government and opposition members who were not present at the time of vote were seen rushing in from time to time. However, government members left the Floor soon and Joint Opposition members remained in the House until around 6.50 p.m.
However, Joint Opposition and JVP members reached a decision to watch the CCTV video footage of in the House. They met Secretary General Dhammika Dassanayake and watched the footage until 8.85 p.m. JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Ratnayake in the mid of investigation around 7.45 p.m. said it seemed that the result was incorrect. The matter as to how to deal with this situation politically and legally would be discussed today in Parliament, Ratnayake said.
MEP member Sisira Jayakody told the media around 8.00 p.m. while the investigation was in progress that according to the existing details the results of the vote should be 29 for the motion and 31 against.
He added that Mujubur Rahuman had mistakenly counted twice. The CCTV footage of four angles were scrutinised by the members and the Secretary General. Three footage were watched in the Secretary Generals office and it was decided to watch the last footage in Committee Room 01. They all moved into the room at around 8.35 p.m. Around 8.55 p.m. the investigation was over.
It was decided that the results was incorrect. According to the investigation results, 31 had voted for and 31 had voted against. Due to this situation again the vote would have to be taken up some other day, Opposition Member Dinesh Ginawardena said. JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that they would raise this matter in Parliament today.
Meanwhile, UNP Parliamentarian Ashuboda Marasinghe said the Joint Opposition members move to force the Secretary General of Parliament to scrutinise the CCTV footage of the final vote on the Supplementary Sum was totally illegal.
He made this observation to media in the Parliamentary Complex after Joint Opposition and JVP members made statements that the result of the vote was incorrect following Secretary General Dhammika Dassanayake, other officials and members watched video footages.
Marasinghe said if they did not agree with the results there was an accepted procedure to raise a question. He added that it was an illegal influence made by Joint Opposition members to force the Secretary General to study the videos.
He added that as government members they would raise this issue in Parliament today.

Temporarily suspend tax revisions: Anura Kumara
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake asked the government to temporarily suspend the tax revisions effective from May 2 stating that the Parliament has not approved them.
He was participating in the debate yesterday in Parliament.
Just because the Prime Minister read a statement in Parliament, tax revisions would not get the required validity. Those must be approved by Parliament. There is a budget which was passed with two thirds majority in Parliament last December. These revisions are contrary to it, Dissanayake said.
The MP also rejected the governments claim that the VAT increase would not affect the ordinary masses. Even though the government has exempted a list of goods from the VAT, the retail and wholesale trade come under the VAT. Every shop that has sales over Rs. 33,000 per day should pay 15 percent VAT. Today, almost all the shops have a daily turnover over of Rs. 33,000. In addition to that these shops should also pay two percent NBT and Economic Service Charge as of the value of their business. The shop owners would pass this burden to the people by increasing the prices of goods sold at their shops, he said.
Dissanayake demanded to reveal the agreement signed between the government and IMF. The Prime Minister should have presented this agreement to Parliament prior to signing it. The Parliament is still unaware of its content. However, the general condition of the IMF when granting loans is to reduce the budget deficit. The government increased the taxes and curtailed the relief measures to get qualified to receive this loan, he commented.
MP Dissanayake also raised serious concerns over the irregularities in the Central Bank Treasury Bonds issuance. On January 8 the Central Bank issued Treasury Bonds worth Rs. 19.6 billion that have 25 years maturity period. These were bought by the Perpetual Company, and within several hours those were once again sold by the company to the EPF, he observed.
Dissanayake charged that the investigations on the allegations of fraud and corruption have been suppressed through political influences. It is the politicians who decide which one is to be arrested and when that arrest to take place.
How did Sajin Vass come out of the prison One may argue he was given bail, but we say it happened as a result of a pre-discussion. He was also given Police security. The government is protecting the wrong doers, he charged.
Bringing out several instances of waste in the government, he said the supplementary estimate that was produced before the House for approval yesterday includes among other things Rs. 594 million to purchase vehicles and Rs. 60 million to renovate the Public Enterprises Development Ministry. He also cited the attempted undervalued sale of a land in Vauxhall Street, the renting of a building for the Resettlement Ministry at a higher price, the 65,000 housing project in the North, the Customs releasing of undervalued Toyota Prados imported in 2015 and the renting of a building for the Agriculture Ministry at a higher price as instances of financial irregularities of the government.
Opposition MPspresent only to takepart in brawls
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam told the Parliament yesterday that Opposition MPs would come to Parliament only if there was a fight but do not come to raise questions on behalf of the people during thequestion time.
Although the relevant ministers were present from morning to answer the oral questions of Opposition MPs today, the relevant Opposition MPs who wish to ask questions from the ministers were not present in the Chamber yesterday.
However, if there is a fight in the House, all the Opposition MPs would have been here. The questions are included in the Order Paper, but nobody is present to raise the questions. There are four oral questions listed under my name, but none of the MPs from the Opposition is present in the House to raise them, the minister said.
We as a ministers are here from the morning after setting aside all our important work just to answer the questions. But none of them was here. He said that MPs attendance should be made mandatory if there are listed questions.
Parliament Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said in contrast earlier during the former regime, there were Opposition MPs to ask questions but no minister to answer them. Now on the other hand, there are ministers to answer questions, but no Opposition MPs to raise the questions. Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala said this issue will be discussed at the next Party Leaders meeting to arrive at a solution.
Many essentials not subjectedto VAT: Lakshman Yapa
Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena told Parliament yesterday that there are many essential consumer items which are not subjected to the recent Value Added Tax (VAT) amendment.
People still have a doubt on what consumer items that the imposition of increased VAT has been impacted on. The consumer items such as sprats, potatoes, red onions, big onions, garlic, vatana, dhal, chick peas, green gram, dhal, chili powder, canned fish, sugar, undu, kawpea, kurakkan, Maldive fish, dry fish, oranges, grapes, coriander, suduru, maduru, dilseeds, kurakkan flour, turmeric, undu flour, ground nuts, mango, vegetable oil, fish, makeral fish, yoghurt, butter, margarine, salt and dates are not subjected to VAT as they are registered under the Special Commodity Levy Act.
The minister said there is staff level agreement for an IMF loan amounting to US$ 1.5 billion. We may receive it by June. However, the loan is given to strengthen the economy and we cannot use it for the development activities.
However, the World bank, ADB, Koren funds and JICA aids which are expected to receive after the IMF grants can be utilised for the development projects. There has been a surge in the Stock Market after the IMF grants were announced. Once this is granted, we will release funds for the ongoing development activities and development projects expected to commence this year.
Accordingly, Southern Highway extension up to Hambantota, Outer Circular Highway extension and proposed Ratnapura expressway project, access road to the Colombo Harbour, Marin Drive, an elevated highway from Battaramulla to Athurugiriya, Baseline third stage, Badulla-Chenkaladi road and all rural roads countrywide will be implemented and completed using these funds.
Govts US$ 1,102 mloan largest ever:Weerawansa
The government has taken US$ 1,102 million in 2015 which is the largest amount of loan taken in a year by any government in history, parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa said.
He made this observation yesterday joining the debate on the Supplementary Sum by the Finance Ministry. The motion was moved by the Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella. The Supplementary Sum of Rs. 55 million be payable out of the Consolidated Fund of the country or from any loans obtained by the government for the service of the Financial Year 2016.
Weerawansa said that the stock market is down and the Sri Lankan Rupee is depreciating and added that during 2006-2009 when the war was fought, the Rupee depreciated at an annual rate of 3.2 percent while 2009-2014 the Rupee depreciated by 2.8 percent. But under this government the Rupee was depreciated by 9.2 percent. He added that tea and rubber small holders are in trouble now.
The VAT increase is illegal. If the VAT is being increased the budget has to be amended, Weerawansa said. The VAT increase is not applied on Sugar, milk powder, flour, clothes and rice. But a tax is imposed on businesses that has a Rs. 1 million monthly turn over. This is not a big sum for even a small scale business. He said when the tax increase is imposed on businesses like hotels, textile shops, bakeries, tea kiosks, etc. the owner would increase the prices. Weerawansa said indirectly the VAT has to be paid by the consumers.
Punishment insufficient- Gamini Jayawickrama
Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera yesterday said in Parliament the punishment given to the MPs involved in the brawl in the House was insufficient.
However, he commended that the law has been implemented fairly on both sides.
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday observed that the Speaker has certain limitations on the actions that he could take on the MPs who had misbehaved. Therefore he requested the Speaker to ask the relevant Party Leaders to take appropriate action against the MPs in question as of the report submitted on Wednesday.
Going by the provisions of the Standing Orders, the Speaker at the first instance can only impose one week suspension for a matter related to discipline of an MP.
Water Supply and Urban Development Minister Rauf Hakeem also observed what the party leaders agreed yesterday could be the most lenient punishment that one could think of. Therefore he asked the both sides to cooperate to put an end to the matter.

James Vince eyes Test spot against Sri Lanka
LONDON: James Vince is in pole position to claim a place in Englands top six for the opening Test of the summer. The Hampshire batsman has played only five times at senior level for his country - a single one-dayer and four Twenty20 matches - but is thought to be at the forefront of the selectors minds as they contemplate their squad for the three-match series against Sri Lanka.
The First Investec Test starts at Headingley on May 19 and it is believed a spot in the team is Vinces to lose. He usually bats at No3 for Hampshire.
The 25-year-old began the summer in strong style, scoring a century against reigning champions Yorkshire at Headingley last month.
Vince was the leading run-scorer for England Lions in a three-match Twenty20 series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates late last year, which earned him the man-of-the-series award.
He was also the most prolific batsman in the County Championship two summers ago, passing 1,500 runs and making four centuries.
Four of five cricket pundits of SkySports opted for Vince to be part of the England Test squad against Sri Lanka. "I've gone for James Vince at number three ahead of Nick Compton. If you ask me about the long-term potential, then Vince has got something about him that I would like to see more of - he is a very elegant player, said former England captain Nasser Hussain.
Former England opener Nick Knight said, "I've seen a lot of Vince over the years and I think now is the right time for him. Picking a young player to play Test cricket is all about getting the right timing, and having been part of the England one-day set-up for a while, now is the right time for him. "He is a very classy player, an eye-catching player. He has a hundred in the Championship already this year, against Yorkshire - a very good attack - so his form is good. I have a hunch that this lad is ready to play.
England have decisions to make about their batting line-up. Captain Alastair Cook has not had a regular opening partner since the retirement of Andrew Strauss in 2012.
To put that into perspective, Strauss is now effectively Cooks boss, as managing director of England cricket. Alex Hales did the job in South Africa and is expected to continue in the role, at least during the early part of the summer.
There also remains a feeling that the coaching team remain unconvinced by Nick Compton, who batted at No3 in South Africa.
The retirement of James Taylor, who had to quit the game last month because of a heart condition, has left the selectors with questions to answer.

Warner braces for spin challenge in Sri Lanka
Despite being one of the senior members in the Test side, with 51 appearances in the longest format of the game to boot, Australian opener David Warner, hasn't played a single Test in Sri Lanka. But that doesn't deter the 29-year-old, who believes he knows a thing or two about the pitches in the island nation, as his side slowly gears up for the three-match Test series in July.
Only four members - Usman Khawaja, Nathan Lyon, Shaun Marsh and Peter Siddle - from the 14-member squad that played in Australia's victorious Test series campaign against New Zealand earlier this year, have experienced Test cricket in the island nation. James Pattinson was in the squad that toured Sri Lanka in 2011 but he didn't get a game.
"I was over there when Shaun Marsh made his debut hundred (in September 2011)," Warner told cricket.com.au on Wednesday (May 4). "I've seen first-hand how the wickets are there. I know Pallekele is a nice batting wicket with a bit of late turn in the innings. Galle is traditionally a slow turner and in Colombo it's a very nice batting track. For us, as a batting group, it's about batting long periods and building partnerships and putting on good totals to make sure that our bowlers are in play come the second innings, whether it's through reverse (swing) or spin." Two of Australia's recent tours to the sub-continent ended in disaster as they lost 4-0 to India in 2013 and then 2-0 to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates in 2014. Despite having a career strike rate of 76.92 in the format, Warner saw it come down to 50 in India three years ago. It was slightly better in the UAE, where he was scoring at a rate just under 60.
Warner reasoned that the batsmen can tend to get bogged down in sub-continental conditions and that attacking the spinners could end up working in the batting side's favour. "Sometimes we can get caught being too defensive and forget about attacking a little bit," he said. "Sometimes that can work in your favour if you attack a little bit more the bowler might have to take out a short leg or an extra slip and put it somewhere else. "We've got to be prepared to bat time and battle the demons of whether the ball can actually turn as much as you think. For us it's our bat in front our pads and actually using our feet a bit more and looking to score. We're going to have to come up with a game plan to suit those conditions and you've got to stick to your game plan." Whether his teammates follow suit or not, Warner is sure about taking the aggressive route in Sri Lanka. "At the end of the day, for me, my best way of approaching the game is to look to score runs. "If I'm looking to score then I'm in the right frame of mind. That's always going to be my positive energy and intent and that's always to look to score first and defend second."

KARACHI: Former Australian cricketer Stuart Law has turned down Pakistan Cricket Board's offer of being the next chief coach of Pakistan cricket team. The Pakistan Cricket Board said it will try to convince Law or choose from Englishman Andy Moles and Australian Test batsman Dean Jones.
"Yes there are hurdles in the way of signing on Stuart Law as head coach although he is our first choice for this position," PCB Chairman, Shaharyar Khan told PTI.
"He had applied for a coaching position with us but he has now conveyed he is more interested in a consultant's position and that he wouldn't be able to join the team immediately," Khan said. Currently, Law is already signed up by Cricket Australia as a batting consultant for the tour to Sri Lanka from July to September and apparently he has told the PCB he is also not available when Pakistan tours Australia in November-December this year. Khan admitted that finding the right person for the job had become a tedious task for the board.
Notably, Waqar Younis recently stepped down as the chief coach of the team, following a series of poor performances in limited-overs cricket. - ZMB

Former England allrounder Matthew Fleming has been announced as the next Marylebone Cricket Club president. He was nominated by the current president Roger Knight at the AGM at Lord's.
"It is important to me to nominate a member who is well versed in, and fully supportive of, the ethos of MCC and who will be recognised, not only within the club, but also in the wider world of cricket," said Knight.
"Matthew was a fine allround cricketer, who captained Kent with distinction and who earned England recognition in one-day internationals. A brilliant cover-point fielder, he was often a daring cricketer - indeed his first two scoring shots in first-class cricket were sixes.
"He understands present-day cricketers, as a former Chairman of the Professional Cricketers' Association, and is respected widely around the game. Matthew will undoubtedly be an excellent President of MCC."
Fleming, who is the current Chairman of Cricket will take charge on October 1, 2016. The 51-year-old played 11 One-Day Internationals for England. He played 219 first-class games for Kent scoring 9206 runs at an average of 30.18 and took 290 wickets at 35.91. He then went on to play an important role in the MCC Foundation's work in Afghanistan.

Toss decision is working - Rhodes
Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes says the decision to scrap the toss in the County Championship this season looks like it is working.
The England and Wales Cricket Board made the move in an attempt to improve the standard of pitches and Rhodes says it has already made a difference.
"I think it has," he told BBC.
"If you look back, there have been some very poor wickets - maybe this was the only way they could do it."
The 51-year-old former England wicketkeeper added: "I think, to a certain extent, it's worked.
"There have been some criticisms about wickets being too flat but if you're prepared to bat for a long period of time and concentrate, you'll get runs."
Worcestershire's two Championship matches so far - which have both been draws - have produced eight centuries, with five coming in the match against Gloucestershire and three more in their last game with Essex.
England all-rounder Moeen Ali, Joe Clarke, Brett D'Oliveira and Tom Kohler-Cadmore have all reached three figures for the New Road side and Rhodes says better pitches will help sort out the best players.
"Too many good players were playing forward defensive shots and getting out to average bowlers - that's what was happing before with the wickets," he added. - BBC

Flight from Cocos Islands carrying Sri Lankan asylum seekers
A chartered jet flown from the Cocos Islands to Sri Lanka overnight returned the group of asylum seekers, including children, who had arrived by boat on Monday, locals say.

The arrival of the apparently undetected boat marked the first reported asylum seeker vessel to reach Australian territory in nearly two years.

One resident counted seven children in the group including babies.

He said on Thursday night he saw the group being herded from a mini-bus with covered windows onto a plane at the local airport.

"It was all done specifically under the cover of darkness," he said.

"The way they positioned the vehicles was to obscure as much as possible."

"We all live on the runway basically, it's hard to sneak a big white plane in without anyone knowing."

"There's babies in there, less than one year old. It made it a lot more human."

A local gave Hack a video they say was captured at the airport. It shows a mini-bus with covered windows and a large white passenger jet on the runway.

Another Cocos Island resident confirmed there was at least one child in the group.

A flight tracking website showed a flight listed to depart from Cocos, but with no destination, landed in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo early this morning, according to refugee activist Jessie Taylor.

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection has refused to comment on "operational matters" and therefore won't confirm the number of people in the group.

Locals have told Hack there are between 12-25 people.

Boat anchored 'about 500m' from island
Earlier this week Hack reported a boat carrying Sri Lankan asylum seekers arrived within the Cocos Islands on Monday morning in rough weather.

The thinly populated chain of islands and coral atolls located mid-way between the mainland and Sri Lanka is a territory of Australia.

Local Awie Rasa told Hack he saw the 10-11m wooden boat coming through the passage of the entrance to the main lagoon between the two largest islands about 10:45am.

"It's moving pretty fast, moving 12-15 knots," he told Hack.

"It's heading towards Home Island."

Mr Rasa was taking a ferry from Home Island, which is the most populous, to the capital on West Island.

"When we got to West Island jetty I can see police are preparing for their job. The customs on the jetty are running up and down and getting their tenders into the water."

"I heard it didn't reach Home Island, just anchorage around about 500m away from Home Island.

"That's pretty close."

He said he had worked as a skipper escorting asylum seeker vessels until last year and he believed "the yellow and light blue" boat was Sri Lankan.

"Theyve got the same colour boat - they're all coloured the same."

He believed there were 12 people on board.

Another local man told Hack he saw the boat from shore when it was "well and truly inside the lagoon".

He said the Australian Federal Police then escorted the boat to a mooring and two Border Force launches "appeared at great speed over the horizon".

He said the suspected Sri Lankan asylum seekers were then taken to a Border Force vessel.

"We've had a significant presence [of] Navy and Customs guys for many months. They come, they go, they disappear for a few days and come back," he said.

"As far as vessels reaching the lagoon and getting inside the lagoon  that's certainly the closest one that's got in for some time."

A Border Force spokesperson said the Department would not comment on operational matters.

The last asylum seeker boat reported to arrive in Australia was a vessel of 157 people intercepted in July 2014 near Christmas Island.

The people from that vessel spent a month on a Customs ship before being transferred to the Curtin Detention Centre and then Nauru in mid-2014. (radioaustralia)
