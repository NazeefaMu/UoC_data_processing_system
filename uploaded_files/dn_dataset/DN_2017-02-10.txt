South Africa cricketers face prospect of fines, jail time
The South African cricketers who were caught attempting to fix matches in the 2015-16 domestic Twenty20 tournament are currently in the sights of the countrys National Prosecuting Authority, and are facing the prospect of fines and possible jail time.
Cricbuzz has learnt that the case is in the hands of a state prosecutor, who has gained ammunition from the original whistle-blower in the case.
It has also been established that another player who was involved in the scandal, former South Africa fast bowler Lonwabo Tsotsobe, has failed to pay his legal bills and has regularly ignored the allegations that Cricket South Africas Anti-Corruption Unit have made against him.
The Anti-Corruption Unit have been investigating the events leading up to the 2015-16 Ram Slam Twenty20 tournament since November 2015. In that time, six players have been banned for their part in the saga. While former South Africa international Gulam Bodi was hit with a 20-year ban after admitting to serving as an intermediary between fixers and players, Thami Tsolekile (12 years), Pumelela Matshikwe (10), Ethy Mbhalati (10), Jean Symes (7) and Alviro Petersen (2) have subsequently admitted their part in the affair and received bans.
Of the six, Petersens case was the most intriguing after he claimed to have been the whistle-blower. However, Cricbuzz has learnt that two players from the Dolphins franchise, batsman Vaughn van Jaarsveld and fast bowler Craig Alexander, were in fact responsible for alerting CSA to the scheme. In a statement following his ban, Petersen admitted that he had participated in meetings with fixers and failed to immediately report them as he was obliged to. It is understood that van Jaarsveld and Alexander did not make the same mistake. The involvement of van Jaarsveld and Alexander is significant because both would serve as credible witnesses, unlike the players who have already been banned.
Any charges against the players in South Africa would be based on the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act of 2004, which has a section dedicated to offences relating to sporting events and another relating to gambling. Players who plead guilty to the charges against them would likely appear collectively, but those who claim innocence would appear individually.

Squad named for T20I series in Australia: Malinga returns from injury, Chandimal axed
Sri Lanka one-day specialist fast bowler Lasith Malinga will return to international cricket after a lay-off of ten months from injury when he was named in the 15-member Sri Lanka squad to play Australia in a series of three T20 Internationals later this month.
The national selectors have decided to include the former T20 captain for the short tour Down Under. The team was released to the media subject to Sports Ministers ratification at a press conference held at SLC headquarters yesterday.
In the absence of permanent captain Angelo Mathews due to injury, Upul Tharanga has been named to lead Sri Lanka in the short series. Surprisingly Dinesh Chandimal who led Sri Lanka to a fabulous T20 series victory against South Africa has been dropped from the team to Australia. Chandimal failed to perform well in the ongoing ODI series against South Africa and was sidelined from the fourth ODI. His presence in todays final match remains an uncertainty.
Malinga 33, was off the ground for nearly one year due a left knee injury and returned to training under SLCs high performance manager Simon Willis. Malingas inclusion to the squad was considered after Willis recommendation on the fast bowlers physical ability to perform his duties. Malinga last played for Sri Lanka in the 2016 T20 World Cup.
SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala commenting on Malingas return said he is very happy to have one of Sri Lankas greatest fast bowlers back in the team. He also said that SLC hopes to monitor Malinga carefully for the forthcoming ICC Champions Trophy in June and for the 2019 World Cup.
Malinga said that he hopes to perform well in the practice match in Canberra on February 15, as his performance will help the selectors and captain to make the decision of his inclusion or exclusion in the three-match T20 series against Australia. All-rounder Dasun Shanaka, Milinda Siriwardena, Chamara Kapugedara and opener Dilshan Munaweera were recalled to the team after a lapse of one year while Vikum Sanjaya is the only uncapped player in the squad. Dhananjaya de Silva, Thikshila de Silva, Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal, Kusal Perera and Jeffrey Vandersay who was included in the South Africa T20 series have not been selected for the Australian series.

Sri Lanka squad to Australia: Upul Tharanga (captain), Niroshan Dickwella, Asela Gunaratne, Dilshan Munaweera, Kusal Mendis, Milinda Siriwardena, Sachith Pathirana, Chamara Kapugedara, Seekkuge Prasanna, Nuwan Kulasekara, Isuru Udana, Dasun Shanaka, Lakshan Sandaken, Lasith Malinga and Vikum Sanjaya

Striking staff will have job security, more benefits  SLC president
Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala said that the strike carried out by the ground staff at Dambulla Stadium was unreasonable and the decisions taken by SLC were for the benefit of the workers.
Sumathipala said that the ground staff will secure their jobs and gain more benefits when they are attached to the provincial and district cricket associations.
Presently the ground staff in the country served under the administration of Sri Lanka Cricket but now we have decided to decentralize it so that they come under the provinces and district cricket associations, said Sumathipala at a media conference held at SLC headquarters yesterday.
The ground workers will get more salary and job security by this decision. They will be entitled for the Employees Trust Fund, the Employees Provident Fund and an overtime allowance as per the Labour Rule, he said.
The ground staff in the country started a protest campaign against this decision with several workers of Dambulla International Stadium commencing a hunger strike on the roof top of the stadium while other workers at R. Premadasa International Stadium, Pallekelle International Stadium and Mahinda Rajapaksa International Stadium, Sooriyawewa also joined the protest campaign in support yesterday.
Sumathipala said that SLC have plans to develop national level cricket stadiums in Batticaloa, Badulla and Kurunegala very shortly.

Trump loses appeal court bid to reinstate travel ban

A US appeals court has rejected President Donald Trump's attempt to reinstate his ban on visitors from seven mainly Muslim countries.
The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals said it would not block a lower-court ruling that halted the order.
Trump responded withan angry tweetsaying national security was at risk and there would be a legal challenge.
But the 3-0 unanimous ruling said the government had not proved the terror threat justified reviving the ban.
The ruling means that people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen with visas can continue to enter the US.
And refugees from around the world, who were also subject to a temporary ban, are no longer blocked either.
The case is now likely to end up at the highest court, the US Supreme Court.
What did the three appeal judges say
They rejected the argument, made by the Justice Department on behalf of the US government, that the president had sole discretion to set immigration policy.
The court also said there was "no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order" had committed a terror attack in the US.
They said both sides had made compelling cases.
"On the one hand, the public has a powerful interest in national security and in the ability of an elected president to enact policies.
"And on the other, the public also has an interest in free flow of travel, in avoiding separation of families, and in freedom from discrimination."
But they said the law stripped foreign arrivals of their rights under the Constitution.
What has the reaction been
Trump responded to the ruling by tweeting his dissent, and then gave an audio statement saying it was a political decision.
The Justice Department, which made representations to the appeals court on behalf of the White House, said in a statement it was "reviewing the decision and considering its options".
Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who had sued over the ban, said it was a complete victory for the state.
New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio said: "Here in New York - the safest big city in America - we will always protect our neighbours, no matter where they came from or when they got here. Those are our values."
What it all means - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington
Donald Trump's lawyers did not make their case. In fact, according to three Ninth Circuit judges, they didn't even really try to make their case. Rather than explaining why the temporary travel ban was needed, the administration argued that the president's authority on immigration was so sweeping that they didn't have to explain why the order was necessary.
According to the court, the government was unable to say why Trump's ban addressed a pressing national security threat that a temporary stay of the order would worsen. The lawyers for the challenging states, on the other hand, convinced the judges that re-imposing the order at this point would create further chaos by infringing on the due process rights of those on US soil, regardless of their immigration status.
By issuing a unanimous, unsigned opinion, the judges avoid accusations of partisan bias, as one of the three was a Republican appointee.
Trump tweeted a sharp "SEE YOU IN COURT" following the decision - but which court
An appeal to the Supreme Court seems likely, although a better move for the president may be to fight in the lower court until Judge Neil Gorsuch joins a conservative majority on the bench.
How did we get here
The executive order, at the end of Trump's first week in office, had sparked protests and confusion as people were stopped at US borders.
Then a week later, a federal judge in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order that stopped the ban in its tracks, after Washington state and Minnesota sued.
The Justice Department appealed to the 9th Circuit in San Francisco, which heard oral arguments this week.
Lawyers representing the US government argued that the ban was a "lawful exercise" of presidential authority.
But the two US states said the ban had harmed universities in their states and discriminated against Muslims.
The appeal judges did not rule on the constitutionality or the merits of the law, just on the question of its reinstatement.
The lower court in Seattle must still debate its merits and there are other legal challenges across the country.

Two Myanmar nationals found drifting in a raft after falling into difficulty in deep mid sea were rescued by a group of fishermen from Thoduwawa engaged in fishing on February 8 in the Multi Day boat Ilukshi 05 and handed over to the Trincomalee Harbour Police.
The fishermen told Police that the other Myanmar national would be brought ashore in the multi-day boat Ilukshi -08.
Police said they were finding it difficult to communicate with the rescued person due to language difference. He had however written his name in English on a piece of paper as I Mauseen, birthday as October 14, 1973 and mentioned the telephone number of his residence in Myanmar.
Captain of the Ilukshi 05 boat W.Nicholan Gerrard said the duo were shouting for help drifting in a raft 370 nautical miles off the coast on January 25 when they recued them. After being rescued they touched their stomachs and signaled that they were hungry. After been provided food, the crew in Ihikshi-08 boat brought one of the men ashore.
OIC Harbour Police Inspector Roshan Damith who helped the rescued person with food said once the other Myanmar national was brought ashore they would produce the duo in Court in terms of the Immigration and Emigration Act.

Minimum Standards for medical education: GMOA to reveal saboteurs
The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) presented the recommendations on `Minimum Standards for medical education through a gazette notification in 2009, but it ended up in a Parliamentary Committee without getting through. It was later withdrawn. The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) will reveal who opposed it, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing the media at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo 7 on Wednesday, he said it was time for President Maithripala Sirisena to put his stand on the SAITM into action just as he did for the National Drug Policy which was not possible during the previous regime while holding the Health Minister portfolio.
According to Dr. Zoysa, the Bangladesh Medical Council closed the Chittagong Medical Faculty as it did not have proper standards.
No Sri Lankan Minister or parent shouted at the Bangladesh Government stating that Sri Lankan medical students studying in the faculty are in trouble. The SLMC continues to check the standards and close down medical faculties which do not meet the standards, he said.
The GMOA Secretary said while ensuring the right to education, nobody can eliminate the right to life of the people.
Driving licences are being issued to allow persons to drive while ensuring the safety of pedestrians, he said.
The GMOA respects the right to life of the people and that is why it continues to function accident services and emergency medical services during strikes, he said.

Abductions in Colombo during 2009: Navy intelligence officer further remanded
Lieutenant Commander Dhammika Anil Mapa, a Navy Intelligence officer attached to the Welisara Navy camp arrested for allegedly abducting Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan, a resident of Kotahena in 2009, was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till by Colombo Additional Magistrate J. Trotsky. The Additional Magistrate ordered the Prison Authorities that a special security arrangement be provided when the suspect being kept in the remand custody and taken to Courts.
The CID conducting investigations into an incident where several persons had been abducted by unidentified groups in Colombo and the surrounding areas in 2009 had informed Court at a previous occasion that former Navy Intelligence Director Rear Admiral Ananda Guruge is to be arrested over the disappearance of two individuals in Kotahena. The OIC of the CIDs Gang Robbery Unit-Inspector Nishantha Silva informed Court that former Navy Intelligence Director Ananda Guruge and Lieutenant Commander Sampath Dayananda, a former Navy intelligence officer attached to the Welisara Navy camp would be arrested soon regarding the investigations on the abductions and disappearances of Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan and Rathnasami Paramanandan.
Inspector Nishantha Silva informed Court that the van of Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan was found at the Welisara Navy Camp while being discarded and cut into 72 pieces.
However, Presidents Counsel Anil Silva appearing for the suspect denied allegations leveled against his client but admitted the fact that the Navy Intelligence Unit had taken the concerned vehicle into their custody following a report that it contained bomb concealed and compelled to cut into pieces for the purpose of searching explosive substances.
The CID submitted to Court that there is no legal provision vested with the Navy to carry out such a step and informed Court that the Navy should have brought the matter to the attention of police and bomb disposal unit.
The CID informed Court they have recorded a statement from former Senior DIG Anura Senanayake in connection with two abductions that took place in 2009.
Meanwhile, defence counsel filed written submissions in Court seeking bail on behalf of the suspect.
Defence counsel told Court that the suspect cannot be charged for the offence of committing murder since there is no evidence so far to suggest that the abductees had been murdered by someone.
It is alleged the former Senior DIG covered up evidence into an incident in which two persons had been abducted by an unidentified group from the Kotahena and Wellawatte areas in 2009.
The Colombo Crimes Division initiated investigations into these abductions on the instructions of the IGP following a complaint by then Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda in 2009.
The CID also informed the court that 11 abducted individuals had been detained at the Trincomalee underground detention centre violating their basic human rights.

Action called for against other weaknesses too of Mahendran
Legal action has to be taken against former Central Bank governor Arjuna Mahendren pertaining to administrative and other weaknesses identified through the Central Bank-Internal Audit Department review, Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena.
The review of the procedures adopted on foreign travel and other expenses by the Internal Audit Department had allegedly identified many administrative weaknesses of the former governor. The minister said legal action has to be taken pertaining to the deficiencies by the former governor in relation to foreign travel, credit card payments, incurring other governors entertainment expenses, incurring general office expenses and administrative and other weaknesses identified through the review, apart from the ongoing bond scam issue. Addressing the media at the Finance Ministry yesterday, he said the review is clear evidence of serious mismanagement and corruption.
Referring to the press release issued recently under the name of former Governor Arjuna Mahendren, the minister questioned whether it was released with his signature. If the letter does not have his signature, he can easily say that he did not issue it. It is a problem, if he is not willing to take the responsibility, he said. Minsiter Abeywardena added that the Auditor General has performed his duties in a satisfactory manner and he is obliged to answer only to Parliament. I request the Former Governor to reply to the facts mentioned in the review issued by the Central Bank Internal Audit Department. That has to be done very clearly and not through press releases that divert the peoples attention, Minister Abeywardena added.

Art of friendship
Friendship can at times be one of the most difficult aspects of our lives while at other times the most helpful. In Buddhism, friendship is an extremely important factor, perhaps even more so than you might expect.
Whatever kind of life you have, your friends are both a part of it and a reflection of it. Work or school associates, sports teammates, companions in religious community  in all of these, there is some degree of choice. You accept a job, join a team, or become a member of a social group; and you choose how closely to associate with the people in each group. Even in your family, you choose how close or distant to be with individual members.
Within each of these affiliation groups, there may be people youd like to know better and there may be others youd like to avoid spending time with. How do you choose which people fall into which category Do you like the ones who seem to like you Or the people you consider the most physically attractive Are you drawn to people you consider thoughtful, or wise and helpful Do you passively wait to be contacted, by anyone at all Somehow, by some sorting method, you end up with friends and acquaintances that influence you and whom you influence.
This brief article is concerned with how you choose friends according to the Buddhist point of view.
Qualities
In the Upaddha Sutta, Ven. Ananda approached the Buddha and remarked that "half of the life is based on admirable friendship, admirable companionship and admirable association with the good." to which the Buddha replied, Ven. Ananda, do not say so. Not half, but one's entire life is established on friendship, companionship and association with the good. When a Bhikkhu has admirable people as friends, companions, and comrades, he can be expected to develop and pursue the noble eightfold path.
In the Mitta Sutta, the Buddha tells his monks to seek out friends with seven qualities: "Monks, a friend endowed with seven qualities is worth associating with. Which seven He gives what is hard to give. He does what is hard to do. He endures what is hard to endure. He reveals his secrets to you. He keeps your secrets. When misfortunes strike, he doesn't abandon you. When you're down & out, he doesn't look down on you. A friend endowed with these seven qualities is worth associating with."
The reader would notice there is no mention of being well-versed in the Dhamma, mastery of meditation, or possessing great wisdom. Friendship, the Buddha knew, is far more foundational, far more simple.
Samannaphala Sutta
Buddhist perspective on friends is indicated in several places in Buddhist literature. One such instance is in the Samananaphala Sutta. The friendly nature among the Bhikkhus towards each other was so admirable that King Ajatasattu had remarked that "the Bhikkhus live in unity talking to each other with mutual friendliness .... mixing with each other like milk and water and seeing each other with pleasing eyes," and had even gone further and said, "How nice it would be if my son Udayabhadda too could possess these friendly qualities."
Dighajanu Sutta
According to Buddhist discourses "companionship with the wise" leads to many developmental progression: listening to good advice, rational faith, noble thoughts, clear thinking, self-control, good conduct, conquest of the hindrances, gaining of wisdom and the consequent liberation.
The Buddha provides the following elaboration in the Dighajanu Sutta : 'And what is meant by admirable friendship There is the case where a lay person, in whatever town or village he may dwell, spends time with householders or householders' sons, young or old, who are advanced in virtue. He talks with them, engages them in discussions. He emulates consummate conviction in those who are consummate in conviction, consummate virtue in those who are consummate in virtue, consummate generosity in those who are consummate in generosity, and consummate discernment in those who are consummate in discernment. This is called admirable friendship.'
Sigalovada Sutra
The Buddha's advice regarding friends could also be well grasped by absorbing the contents of the Sigalovada Sutra. These four, young householder, should be understood as foes in the guise of friends:(1) he who appropriates a friend's possessions, (2) he who renders lip-service, (3) he who flatters, (4) he who brings ruin
1) "In four ways, young householder, should one who appropriates be understood as a foe in the guise of a friend: (i) he appropriates his friend's wealth, (ii) he gives little and asks much, (iii) he does his duty out of fear, (iv) he associates for his own advantage.
(2) "In four ways, young householder, should one who renders lip-service be understood as a foe in the guise of a friend: (i) he makes friendly profession as regards the past, (ii) he makes friendly profession as regards the future, (iii) he tries to gain one's favour by empty words, (iv) when opportunity for service has arisen, he expresses his inability.
(3) "In four ways, young householder, should one who flatters be understood as a foe in the guise of a friend: (i) he approves of his friend's evil deeds, (ii) he disapproves his friend's good deeds, (iii) he praises him in his presence, (iv) he speaks ill of him in his absence.
(4) "In four ways, young householder, should one who brings ruin be understood as a foe in the guise of a friend: (i) he is a companion in indulging in intoxicants that cause infatuation and heedlessness, (ii) he is a companion in sauntering in streets at unseemly hours, (iii) he is a companion in frequenting theatrical shows, (iv) he is a companion in indulging in gambling which causes heedlessness."
Next, the Buddha explains that a good friend is a helpmate, does not change in happiness or sorrow and gives only good counsel and sympathizes when something goes wrong.
Friendship is a force that has no parallel; there is no other single power that can generate good qualities in a person as friendship with the good because, after a certain age children stop emulating their parents and start imitating their friends.
How to win Friendship
A Buddhist must understand how to win and keep friends. By being kind and generous you can win friends and also by being courteous and benevolent. Rejoice in a friend's achievements, praise any commendable acts and strong points. But if you always keep on talking of your friend's goodness, kindness, greatness and so on, then you are trying to deceive him. In dealing with friends, one's word should be as clean as the actions.
Buddha has given invaluable advice not only to keep the friendship but also to make the bonds stronger. One should not visit the friends too often or overstay the welcome. It is equally bad not to visit your friends at all. You should judge for yourself how often you should visit your friend, how long you should stay and so on.
A friendship deteriorates by asking favours, especially at wrong times. If at all you ask a favour, it should not be unreasonable or of a demanding nature. Asking favours far too often makes you a pest more than a friend.
Basic ingredients
In this manner, Buddhism points out the basic ingredients to foster a healthy friendship, minimize friction and displeasure, promote good-will, and companionship and ultimately bring about one's welfare here, and spiritual progress leading to the realization of the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana. The foregoing facts show that Buddha's word of advice regarding how to choose friends, win them and keep them expounded over 2580 years ago surpasses all books of the past few centuries on this subject and the Buddhist concept of friendship remains a vibrant force forever.

District coordinators will be appointed to work with communities, businesses and officials in Ampara, Trincomalee and Polonnaruwa, the target districts for the first four years.
Speaking at the event, the High Commissioner said: A profitable and sustainable tourism industry requires more than natural and cultural assets, which Sri Lanka has in abundance, it requires high-level hospitality skills. Skills for Inclusive Growth will train and mentor those already employed in tourism; as well as future employees in the tourism industry, as the sector evolves to meet the needs of local and international visitors.
Minister Samarasinghe added: I express my gratitude to the Australian High Commissioner, and the Australian Government for committing such a large sum for the future development of Sri Lanka not as a loan but as a 100 percent grant, which is very rare to see in this day and age. This underscores the very special historic bilateral relationship that exists between the people of Australia and the people of Sri Lanka.
The programme will support the full value chain of the tourism sector, for example, food suppliers, hospitality trainers, artisans, surf instructors, spa owners, accommodation providers, taxi drivers, as well as district planners, park rangers, industry regulators and business chambers, he said.

Bandarigoda exposes MRs double speak on SAITM
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who had favoured the establishment of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) is now against granting provisional registration to the SAITM medical graduates, Galle District United National Party (UNP) Parliamentarian Bandula Lal Bandarigoda said. Speaking at a media briefing at Sirikota UNP Headquarters yesterday, Bandarigoda said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had provided SAITM with a 5 acre land and granted a loan amounting Rs. 600 million during his regime.
Therefore, it confirms that the former President is solely focused on re gaining political power by making falsehoods in order to act in his personal interests rather than driving Sri Lanka towards sustainable development, he added. Colombo District UNP Parliamentarian Mujibur Rahman said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa failed to establish national unity, harmony and reconciliation even after the 30 year war had come to an end.
The consensus Government will not break the promise made to re-establish good governance, democracy, reconciliation, media freedom and to produce a better Sri Lanka for future generations, Rahman added.
He also said that a constitution acceptable to all would be created in order to achieve sustainable development and pave the way for every citizen could stand as one irrespective of differences.

Battle between truth and knowledge
Most significant incident that took place on the Navam Poya Day was the appointment of two chief disciples or agrasravakas, Sariputta and Moggallana. The enlightened one with his divine eye saw that some senior monks were negatively reflecting upon the decision and explained to them the suitability of those two appointments. In order to clarify his stand Buddha explained that seniority was not the only factor or qualification that had been considered in making those two key appointments.
Buddhas discourse, Ovada Prathimoksha, helped monks to develop self-discipline. The other significant incident that took place on the Navam Poya Day was the holding of first ever Buddhist council. On the first Navam Full Moon Poya day after the Enlightenment of the Buddha, there were a large number of disciples in the Order of Maha Sangha. Although there had been no problems until then the Enlightened One would have expected incidents of breach of behavior and morality when the society of Sangha grew in number.
The aspirants of asceticism, initially, were ordained by Buddha Himself. As the Sangha community grew, Buddha introduced the principles of delegation and requested the members of the Maha Sangha to ordain the candidates.
This enabled them to go into priesthood when and where they wished. Buddha will intervene if they needed any clarifications and advice. As mentioned, the appointment of Sariputta and Moggallana as the two  Aggrasavaka took place on Navam Poya. Sariputta was appointed to the prestigious position of Dharmasenadipathi and Moggallana as Dharmapurohita respectively. There were discussions as to why some of the senior monks were overlooked in making these important appointments. To clear all misgivings of the monks, the Enlightened One, related the exciting story woven round Sariyuth and Mugalan in their previous birth during the time of Anomadassi Buddha. The Arahat Sariputta born during Anomadassi and was known as Sarada. He inherited massive wealth and a "Good Samaritan" who distributed wealth among the poor people. Through meditation, he gained Attasamapatti - eight attainments. Sarada had a close friend by the name of Siriwardane. Buddha Anomadassi preached to him. At the end of the sermon, except Sarada, all attained Arahatship. Saradas goal was to be become a chief disciple of Gautama Buddha. Anomadassi Buddha gave Sarada the assurance to be one of the chief disciples of Gautama Buddha. His friend Siriwardena too presented alms to Anomadassi Buddha, and aspired for the second position of chief disciple. Buddhas announcement of Parinibbana within three months is also a significant event associated with Navam full moon.
In the journey of Truth, one must understand that merely collecting knowledge is not enough; first hand realization of the fact is key. Acquiring knowledge by listening to others or by reading books, affects only superficial layers of consciousness. At deeper layers of our being nothing really changes by merely acquiring knowledge.
Realization is direct, first hand, experience of the fact of life. When there is direct Realization of a fact of life, the whole being including the conscious, subconscious and unconscious realizes it, leaving no doubt whatsoever about the Truth. Let us take a direct example. Most of us have realized in our life, by direct experience at some point of time in life that Touching very hot objects can burn and hurt life. Now, when there is fire or there is very hot object, there is not even a little confusion about what one must do. In contrast, lets take example of a child who has merely heard his mother say, the fire burns or do not touch hot objects. As he has mere knowledge but no realization of the fact, he may still feel curious to touch the object.
One must take a journey that can change his or her life does not merely give you knowledge, it takes you on a journey where you can directly realize the facts of Mind and the Human Consciousness as it takes place inside you. Layer by layer, you can realize the facts of life. Truth of existence dawns when you reach there!
Animals talk all the time. They are exactly the same as you and me and perhaps so much greater because they have powers that you cannot even dream of. They love, feel scared, they cry, laugh, and they know when you are going to kill them. The only way in which we are superior is that we know how to kill and we use that power all the time. So many animals know their previous lives and their relationship to the people that they live with. Each one of us has been connected in so many different ways to all the animals that we encounter  including the ones we eat Animals carry this knowledge, we humans with our utterly selfish attitudes, have lost it.
If all of us had the capability to think like them, what a different world it would be. How could you kill them or eat an animal that is exactly like you We do not have the abilities that animals have; some of them change their colours to suit their surroundings. A non-poisonous insect will develop the colours of a poisonous insect to keep predators away. A male garter snake produces a female smell when it feels cold, so that other males would rush in and form balls around it transmitting their heat to him. Sparrows with smaller bibs will always give way to the sparrows with the larger bibs to allow them to mate with females outside of their normal pair.
A fox would lie upside down with its eyes closed, and tongue hanging out  creating an impression in birds, its dead. Birds come down to consume the dead body.
Fox waits for an opportune moment to jump up and catch one of them. Is there any disparity between their behaviour and ours  apart from that they are much smarter.
In a world that is ruled by human continuously at war with all the other variety  and win a war by killing and harming and destroying them.
May all beings be Happy!

Beyond democracy deficit
It is not an exaggeration to say that people are burdened with an unbearable cost of living. Prices of essentials have sky-rocketed. Moreover, they are unable to see any light even at the end of the tunnel.
They are suffering not only from economic woes. Political developments too affect them adversely. The number of street protests is increasing in number and frequency. Police more frequently use tear gas and water canon to quell them. Among the disillusioned are many that voted this government into power and still its sympathizers. Unless checked soon this disillusion would develop into despair.
The President seems to acknowledge this situation. That is why he once called for closer cooperation between the Government and those who voted for it. However, such cooperation is not a one-way street. It is a two way process. Not only should the faithful support the Government but the latter also should amend its unpopular conduct to solicit such support.
Obviously there is an estrangement between the Government and the people at large. How could it be dispelled Is there a way out Or is it irreversible
King-makers at village level
Principal reason for the above disillusion is that the Government has failed to take the people into confidence. Not only has it failed to consult the people in taking vital decisions but also taking decisions contrary to what it pledged at the elections. There is a streak of authoritarianism in certain actions taken by it.
The master-servant relation between the politician and the voter has turned topsy-turvy now with the elected representative in the Government becoming the master. Those who are expected to represent peoples sovereignty have a tendency to usurp it.
It is a fact that while the Opposition has carried its message at frequent public allies and grassroots level discussions the Government (not its constituent political parties) has hardly held any meetings of its own. Instead its leaders used to frequently pontificate at temples and official functions where the people are just spectators only. Actually some politicians want them to be just that spectators only!
Over the years a class of middlemen have emerged that act as go-betweens between the voters and the elected MPs. It is this class that has accumulated wealth and power through corruption and has virtually become king-makers at village level.
Public apathy and indifference concerning vital problems affecting them unless and until it affects them personally or their acceptance of reality as their fait accompli is another cause of the disillusionment. Unfortunately Sri Lanka does not have vibrant civil society organisations. Even those that sprang up spontaneously at the elections have not developed into well-structured and organised mass organisations. Instead they continue to cry on few capable individuals who also shun organisation and discipline. There is hardly any internal democracy in them.
Unfortunately the trade union movement is so much divided on party and communal lines that it is unable to take up political issues as a united force. Nor has the majority of its membership developed political consciousness to go beyond the struggle for economic demands.
Flaws in election procedures
There exists a democracy deficit here. Politicians often refer to Universal suffrage as the acme of democracy and point to periodic elections as the criterion of democracy and even give it a star-rating of their own. Though universal suffrage is a significant democratic achievement it is rather a point of departure and not the pinnacle of its success.
Flaws in election procedures and rigging of elections have been perfected over the years by vested interest. For example, nomination procedures for elections seem to depend heavily on party bigwigs and money-bags. It has failed to attract more talented and unselfish individuals for representative bodies. Gender-wise discrimination too continues unabated despite the allocation of quotas for women in the nomination lists. The latter is ineffective as quotas do not relate to representation in the elected bodies. Besides some minority communities are also unrepresented in Parliament and Provincial Councils so that they have become voiceless.
It is necessary to move forward from representative democracy to participatory democracy. For this purpose one has to think out of the box and be innovative. Imitating or adapting to western concepts without consideration for national socio-economic and cultural background could bring about only limited success.
There is much disillusion against the Government for its apathy in dealing with corruption and fraud in public office. There are instances when whistle-blowers are unprotected and witnesses find it unsafe to come out with what they know due to the climate of impunity enjoyed by wrong-doers and the power they hold.
During the 1970s the United Front Government experimented with Workers Councils in an attempt to involve the workers in the decision making process. Though it failed then, experimenting with it is worth since the failure was more due to its overtly political bias instead of being representative. Similar bodies even at the village/town level could involve the people at grassroots level in administration. For example citizens Committees at Ward level in local government bodies could be watchdogs countering corruption in public works. These committees should be broad based and not be comprised of political party representatives for it would defeatist very purpose and fall prey to the dictates of political hierarchy.
Fraudulent deals
Devolution of power as different from decentralization will be an extension of democracy and a step towards participatory democracy. It should not be looked solely as an attempt to pacify minority communities. The essence of devolution is economic devolution.
Our leaders now often appeal to children to rectify the mistakes of the elders. Temperance campaigners for example tell children to advise their parents on the evils of drinking. The same appeal is made to children to foster national reconciliation. All these are done while the elders are engaged in acrimonious squabbles and spreading hate and revenge seeing. It is like the crab asking the baby crabs to move straight.
It is time the leaders to give an example. Rectification should be top-down to be effective. If they greedily grab more power and material wealth necessary for an ostentatious living and stoop to engage in fraudulent deals how could they reform society
If the law enforcing authorities are prevented from investigating and proceeding with corruption and fraud in public office and an apparent discrimination in the application of law is observed by the people how could such vice be eliminated Here the young generation is helpless. For democracy to function rule of law should be respected and followed. However, instances in which it is infringed occur daily. For example everyone talks about road indiscipline and violation of traffic laws. But it is not only on the road that law is infringed. It is ubiquitous ranging from flouting the sequential order at ordinary queues for provisions or hand-outs to violation of tender procedures of mega projects or disregard for environmental protection when alienating land for development.

Ranjan exposes shortcomings in bureaucratic machinery
The manner in which Deputy Minister Ramanayake publicly dealt with the Divisional Secretary of Divulapitiya for her alleged failure to prevent the illegal mining of a large extent of soil brought into focus a major shortcoming in the states bureaucratic machinery not only in the prevention of the devastation of the environment, but even more importantly the daylight robbery of the states natural resources.
Although precious metals, diamonds or petroleum have not been discovered to date, Sri Lanka is richly endowed with gem stones of high value, high quality graphite, limestone, quartz, granite, rare endemic species of fauna and flora, mangroves and wetlands. Sand, earth and clay have become natural resources much in demand today because of the booming construction industry.
The Divulapitiya incident has shown that the issue of licences for the exploitation of these resources is a farce. Armed with a licence for the excavation of eg. a hundred cubes of soil or sand millions of cubes are excavated; with a licence for one gem pit hundreds of pits are dug; with a permit to fill 20 perches of land acres are reclaimed. Defective licenses are issued eg. places and quantities not specified ensuring failed prosecutions. These are intentionally done in most cases.
The open and blatant manner in which organized gangs carry out these operations invariably with the backing of a politician in power and officials turning a blind eye make the people believe that such operations are being lawfully carried out.
The businessmen who carry out large scale exploitation of these resources often engage the services of underworld criminals and bribe officials including law-enforcement officers. As a result people fear to complain or provide information to the authorities concerned.
The Divulapitiya incident is truly an eye opener. The President and others concerned should look at the positive side to this episode. Ramanayake may have been excessively harsh on the Divisional Secretary. But being a candid and forthright politician with a reputation for honesty his burst of anger is understandable. Any law abiding citizen would have been agitated seeing the devastation that the landscape had undergone.
These corrupt activities so prolific and widespread are causing inestimable losses to the state and illegally benefiting a coterie of rogues. The nation is indebted to Ramanayake for exposing this albeit unintentional. He should continue to fearlessly provide leadership for the eradication of this canker. What better cause than the preservation of the environment and the ending of the plunder of the state to the tune of billions.
This subtle manner in which losses are caused to the country has reached alarming proportions Apart from heavy fines, legal provision for the mandatory confiscation of all such illegal earnings appears to be the only solution.

Country needs private universities: Yapa
It is the responsibility of every politician to find a solution to the SAITM issue as it has been turned out to be one of the main problems in the country, Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena.
Addressing the media at the Finance Ministry yesterday, Minister Abeywardena said the country is in need of more doctors and added that private universities have to be accepted and necessary measures should be taken to solve the problems related to their standards.
Only 25,000 students enter university every year and there are eight medical faculties. According to the Z- score, sometimes a student who gets 3As in the Advance Level from Colombo will not get a chance but a student with 2 Bs and a C from Moneragala might enter the university according to the present university intake system, he said.
Abeywardena said out of the 1,400 medical doctors who pass out every year, 1,200 are from state universities and 200 from foreign universities.
"However, the country needs to produce more than 2,000 doctors each year. Private universities are accepted worldwide and why should we refuse it without any grounds he questioned.
Sri Lankan students go to foreign universities to obtain medical degrees. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa gave 10 scholarships worth Rs. 70 million as he accepted SAITM as a Medical College. This is not an issue that should be taken to roads by politicians. It is the responsibility of politicians to find a solution, he added.
Minister Abeywardena pointed out that the ones who are against private medical universities talk about the standards of it but fail to talk about the standards of the state universities.
The SLMC should allow SAITM students to write the Act 16 exam or find out a proper solution, he said.

Court orders Jaliya to be admitted to private hospital
The Colombo High Court yesterday issued an order directing the Prison authorities that former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Jaliya Wickramasuriya be admitted to a private hospital in Colombo from the Colombo National Hospital where he was being treated for a number of ailments including a heart decease.
High Court Judge Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne made this order taking into consideration a request made by Jaliya Wickramasuriya through a bail revision application. The Court further ordered the Prison Authorities to provide protection around the clock to the suspect at the private hospital. This revision petition is to be taken up for objections on February 28. Former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Jaliya Wickramasuriya arrested for allegedly misappropriating USD 330,000 out of USD 6.6 million allocated for purchasing a building for the Sri Lankan Embassy, had been ordered to be further remanded till February 23 by Colombo Fort Magistrates Court.
The suspect was brought to the Court premises by prison officials in an ambulance and subsequently brought to the Court room in a hospital patient bed. Filing this bail revision petition in the High Court, Presidents Counsel Shavendra Fernando moved to revise the Fort Magistrates order to refuse bail for the suspect on a number of occasions. The defence had moved Magistrates Court that the suspects health condition (heart patient) be also considered as an exceptional circumstance to release the suspect on bail.
While refusing to grant bail, the Magistrate further observed that the suspects health condition cannot be considered as an exceptional circumstance since the Colombo National Hospital can provide treatment for such an illness.
The FCID alleged that the suspect had misappropriated the amount during the purchase of a building to house the Sri Lankan embassy at 3025, White Haven Street, Washington 2008. The former ambassador had remitted this money to Sri Lanka. The former ambassador is a close relative of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Deep- rooted Friendship: 60th anniversary of the establishment of China-Sri Lanka diplomatic relations
China and Sri Lanka are close neighbours enjoying traditional friendship. As early as 410 AD, the famous Chinese monk Fa Xian (Fa Hsien) travelled to Sri Lanka, acquired Buddhist texts and preached Buddhism in the island country for two years. The journey of Fa Xian ushered in the long history of friendly exchanges and communication between the two ancient civilizations. In the 15th century before the western great discoveries of geography, Chinese navigator Zheng He voyaged along the ancient maritime silk road and landed in Sri Lanka five times.
His journey further linked China and Sri Lanka together. Today we can still trace back this very history to the China Bay in Trincomalee, Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. We are proud of our ancestors long time engagement with each other and confident of the future development of the China-Sri Lanka traditional friendship.
Sustained friendship based on mutual respect, mutual trust and equality and mutual benefit
This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka and the 65th anniversary of the signing of the Rubber and Rice Pact. 65 years ago, in the background of the cold war, our two countries determined to sign the Rubber and Rice Pact with each other despite of the western objection, opening a door for the two traditional friends to communicate with and support each other again. On February 7, 1957, China and Sri Lanka established diplomatic ties and continued the deep-rooted friendship.
When we talk about China-Sri Lanka relationship, most people of both countries will speak of the historical moment in 1957 when Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai made the public speech at the Independence Square in the rain and the historical moment in 1971 when Sri Lankan Prime Minister Madam Bandaranaike presented the baby elephant Mitura to Chinese people. Such precious friendship has been handed down from generation to generation and enhanced ever since.
Over the six decades since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the bilateral relations have always maintained a sound and steady development. China and Sri Lanka have carried out cooperation by upholding the principle of equality and mutual benefits, aiming to bring tangible benefits to the two peoples.
China always attaches importance on its relations with Sri Lanka in its neighbourhood diplomacy and stands ready to make joint efforts with Sri Lanka to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in all fields and promote the bilateral strategic and cooperative partnership featuring sincere mutual assistance and ever-lasting friendship to a new height. Regardless of the changing international landscape and internal politics of both nations, the Chinese government and people have maintained intimate traditional friendship with Sri Lanka. Nowadays, China-Sri Lanka relations have become a model of friendly exchanges between countries.
Strategic cooperative partnership grows with renewed vigour and vitality
In recent years, China-Sri Lanka relations have entered into a new era of strategic cooperative partnership. Since the end of the internal conflict in 2009, Sri Lanka has been on the sound track of political stability and social harmony. Reconstruction and reconciliation have progressed smoothly, resulting in rapid economic and social development and significant improvement of people's livelihood. China welcomes the tangible and significant progress made in addressing the challenges of post-conflict development and stands unswervingly with Sri Lanka on the path of reconstruction and development.
In September 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Sri Lanka, which is the first ever during the past 28 years, opening a new chapter of China-Sri Lanka relations. Six months later, in March 2015, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena conducted a state visit to China shortly after resuming office, which consolidated and deepened China-Sri Lanka friendly cooperative ties. In April and August, 2016, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visited China twice and reached a lot of consensus with the Chinese leaders on further enhancing mutually beneficial cooperation.
Today, BMICH, Nelum Pokuna Theatre and the Supreme Court Complex etc., donated and constructed by China in the past decades witness Chinese people's unselfish contribution to Sri Lankan people. Mega projects such as Colombo South Container Terminal, Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, Colombo-Katunayake Expressway, Southern Expressway, A9 road, Mattala International Airport, and Phase one of Hanmbantota Port and three China-Sri Lanka Friendship Villages have become the new landmarks of China-Sri Lanka friendship.
China's Support has laid an indispensable basis for the development of Sri Lanka which has now become one of the most vibrant developing countries with prominent prospects.
Up to now, China has provided preferential loans amounting more than RMB 40 billion (over Rs. 800 billion) and donation worth more than RMB 10 billions (over Rs. 200 billion) to Sri Lanka. The two countries enterprises have worked together and constructed a lot of mega projects which benefit Sri Lankan development and the people's livelihood. Those projects have also created more than 100 thousands job opportunities for the local people, trained tens of thousands of technicians and managers, and promoted the rapid development of various sectors.
China has been Sri Lankas second-largest tourism source market since 2014.
In 2016, Sri Lanka received more than 270 thousand arrivals from China, up 26.8 percent year-on-year. The number of Chinese tourists to Sri Lanka is on an upward curve, which stands for the deepening and enlarging people to people exchanges between our two countries. It is also a new fashion for Sri Lankans to do business, travel and study in China. Last year, China provided more than 1,000 scholarships and training opportunities to Sri Lanka ranging from academic study to language training, professional training, etc. Government officials at different levels, businessmen, professionals, students and tourists are conducting more and more interactions and communications among each other, which will definitely enhance the understanding and friendship between our two peoples.
The exchanges and cooperation between China and Sri Lanka, are fraternal and mutually beneficial, which has established a model for south-south cooperation. And the China-Sri Lanka strategic cooperative partnership has been growing stronger and stronger.
Bright future with joint construction of the 21st Maritime Silk Road
The China-Sri Lanka friendship, nurtured by generations of the leaders of both countries and personages from all circles and treasuries and cherished by the two peoples, should be earnestly and everlastingly inherited, maintained and developed.
As an important stop of the ancient Maritime Silk Road, Sri Lanka had witnessed the prosperous era in the history. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the national government have made a clear development blueprint for Sri Lanka. We believe that with the joint efforts of the government and people, Sri Lanka will surely realize its aspiration.
On the way forward, China will always stand with Sri Lanka and spare no efforts to mutually create a more brilliant tomorrow for our bilateral relations and to realize the dreams of our two countries. Currently, China and Sri Lanka is on the journey of jointly constructing the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. The Chinese side would like to maximize the synergy of each others respective development strategies under the framework of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road to achieve mutual benefits and common development.
China will continue to preserve the strong development momentum of bilateral relations. We are willing to maintain close high-level exchanges, strengthen friendly exchanges between political parties and governmental departments of both sides and constantly consolidate and enhance political mutual trust.
We are willing to implement the important consensus reached by both leaders together with Sri Lanka, accelerate the alignment of development strategies and forge the upgraded version of bilateral cooperation and development and jointly push for constant progress of China-Sri Lanka relations so that both peoples can benefit more from bilateral cooperation.
China will continue to encourage Chinese companies to invest in Sri Lanka, and actively participate in the projects like construction and management of ports and neighbouring industrial zones, transportation infrastructure, and processing and manufacturing industry, etc., and jointly foster new economic growth point of bilateral economic cooperation. China will fullfill its promises to assist Sri Lanka to carry out livelihood projects such as the Kidney Disease Hospital, the Outpatient Department of National Hospital and the Water Quality Monitoring Center.
China will continue to enhance the people to people exchanges with Sri Lanka. As a Chinese saying goes, the relationship between two countries is based on the affection between two countries civilians. China will continue to support the Sri Lankan side to conduct tourism promotion in China, encourage Chinese citizens to travel in Sri Lanka, support the airline companies to open more direct flights, and facilitate people to people engagement and trade exchanges. China will continue to provide scholarships and trainingships for Sri Lankans and support the exchanges and cooperation between universities, think tanks, media and Buddhism societies of the two countries, and enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.
There are endless stories and wonderful prospects for the friendship and cooperation between China and Sri Lanka. We believe that China-Sri Lanka relations will usher in a more beautiful and bright future. The friendly cooperation between China and Sri Lanka will definitely bear more fruits and bring tangible benefits to the two peoples.
May the friendship between China and Sri Lanka be everlasting!

Discipline established
Sakyamuni Sri Siddhartha Gauthama Buddha out of compassion for suffering humanity realized the truth of suffering and the path to happiness. He set out on his quest to discover the cause of repeated births and deaths in the never ending cycle of Samsara. It was quite a success. The summit of perfection which he attained with his own endeavours was for the entire humanity. The Buddha knew seven persons who could understand his Dhamma. When he surveyed the world with his divine eye, he found that his first two teachers had passed away.
But the five ascetic friends who had been with him at Uruvela were there, now residing at Deer Park in Isipatana. Then Noble Mission, he proceeded to Saranath and delivered his first sermon to his onetime colleagues who were of the view that he had failed in his attempts to find the supreme truth and had determined to retrain from greeting and welcoming him. But as he came closer, it was not possible.
They were so impressed that they, at once respected him with reverence. As soon as Buddha spoke the mother earth trembled creating many miraculous marvels. Thus he delivered his first sermon and set in motion the wheel of Dhamma. Ven Kondanna was the first disciple to attain the eye of Dhamma. The others too became Arahats later. They, thus became the first disciples establishing Buddha Sasana. The foundation for the Sangha was laid. Later Yasakulaputra and his 55 disciples attained Arahantship. He then addressed the 60 Arahanths to fulfill the sasanic tour. Go forth Bhikkus into the world taking the message to them, Explain to them, what I have explained for the wellbeing of the majority.
Then the Buddha himself set out for Rajagaha, having sent them on the great mission of preaching the doctrine of the Dhamma. On his way he met the hermit monks  the three brothers Uruwela, Nadi and Gaya Kashyapa together with their 1000 disciples at Uruwela, Senanigama. There he preached the doctrine and helped them to attain Arahantship.
The next notable event was the arrival of the two youths who were destined to become two great Arahats next to Buddha  the two friends Kolitha Upatissa who belonged to leading families of the day. They came with their retinue numbering 250. They all obtained the eye of Dhamma. Here they got the unique opportunity of entering the order. The Buddha assembled the 1250 Bhikkhus to one place and pronounced Kolitha and Upatissa the Chief disciples of the Sasana, naming them as Sariputta and Moggallana. This event occurred on the Navam Full Moon day.
The Buddha explained that they received permission (Niyata Vivarana)from a previous Buddha Anomadassi who with his divine vision had predicted that they would be the next chief disciples in the sasana. This supreme position was extremely pious lives led throughout sansara by the two friends and the culmination was on the Navam Poya day.
The period of two decades since the enlightenment of the Sakyamuni Gauthama Buddha, the Vinaya  the code of discipline of the Sangha community is said to be par-excellent. Hence there was no necessity or any urgency for enacting rules and regulations. The Sangha then devoted their full time and energy to concentrate on Dhamma as the achievement of perfection in Seela was what was expected of them.
The disciples were leading of life of pretty and sanctity. They listened with utmost faith to the sermons of the Buddha and the Magha Puja which falls usually in the month of Navam was a reflection of the Sangha. It signifies the early period of the establishment of the Sangha, commemorating the day when 1250 Arahants came together to listen to his Dhamma. It was on this day that the Buddha preached the discourse known as Ovada Patimokkha which established the tradition of Sangha coming together before the rules of Vinaya.
This is referred to as the basis and foundation of the Buddhas teachings and was delivered on the first Navam Full Moon day after the enlightenment. This is said to have created a very disciplined and orderly Sangha Samaja to preserve the doctrine.
When Sakyamuni Gauthama was getting rid for the final journey known as Aayu Sanskara Ven Ananda Thera who was the closest to Buddha failed for a moment to extend his invitation to live further. His failure to do so gave the opportunity to Mara, to fulfill his objective of seeing the end of the Thathagatha. He complied with the request of Mara with universal love and compassion towards all beings, leaving behind the great doctrine. Aaya Sanskara was determined on this Navam Full Moon day in the Buddhist Calendar.

Inheritance of inspiration
The monk order hails from Sariputta and Moggallana, according to scriptures. Both arahants, especially Sariputta, bear tales of inspiration. How they became chief disciples is an interesting tale, as laid down in Bhikkhu Nanamolis The Life of Sariputta:
Having approached, the friends saluted the Blessed One reverentially and sat down at one side. When they were seated they spoke to the Blessed One, saying: May we obtain, O Lord, the ordination of the Going Forth under the Blessed One, may we obtain the Higher Ordination!
And the Blessed One said: Come, O bhikkhus! Well proclaimed is the Dhamma. Now live the Life of Purity, to make an end of suffering! This alone served as the ordination of these venerable ones.
Then the master continued his sermon, taking the individual temperaments of the listeners into consideration; and with the exception of the two chief disciples all of them attained to Arahatship. But the two chief disciples had not yet completed the task of attaining to the three higher paths of sanctity. The reason for this was the greatness of the knowledge pertaining to the perfection of a disciple (savakaparami ana), which they had still to reach.
Upatissa received the name of Sariputta on becoming a disciple of the Buddha, while Kolita became known as Maha Moggallana.
Now the Venerable Maha Moggallana went to live at a village in Magadha called Kallavala, on which he depended for almsfood. On the seventh day after his ordination when he was doing the recluses work (of meditation), fatigue and torpor fell upon him. But spurred on by the Master, he dispelled his fatigue, and while listening to the Master expounding to him the meditation subject of the elements (dhatu-kammatthana), he completed the task of winning to the three higher paths and reached the acme of a disciples perfections (savaka-parami).
But the Venerable Sariputta continued to stay near the Master, at a cave called the Boars Shelter (Sukarakhata-lena), depending on Rajagaha for his almsfood. Half a month after his ordination the Blessed One gave a discourse on the comprehension of feelings to the Venerable Sariputtas nephew, the wandering ascetic Dighanakha. The Venerable Sariputta was standing behind the Master, fanning him. While following with his thoughts the progress of the discourse, as though sharing the food prepared for another, the Venerable Sariputta on that occasion reached the acme of knowledge pertaining to a disciples perfection and attained to Arahatship together with the fourfold analytical knowledge (patisambhida-ana). And his nephew, at the end of the sermon, was established in the Fruition of stream-entry.
Now it may be asked: Did not the Venerable Sariputta possess great wisdom; and if so, why did he attain to the disciples perfections later than the Venerable Maha Moggallana The answer is, because of the greatness of the preparations necessary for it. When poor people want to go anywhere they take to the road at once; but in the case of kings, larger preparations are required, as for instance to get ready the elephants and chariots, and so on. Thus it was in this case.
On that same day, when the evening shadows had lengthened, the Master caused his disciples to assemble and bestowed upon the two Elders the rank of Chief Disciples. At this, some monks were displeased and said among themselves: The Master should have given the rank of Chief Disciples to those who were ordained first, that is, the Group of Five disciples. If not to them, then either to the group of two hundred and fifty bhikkhus headed by Yasa, or to the thirty of the Auspicious Group (Bhaddavaggiya), or else to the three Kassapa brothers. But passing over all these Great Elders, he has given it to those whose ordination was the very last of all.
The Master inquired about the subject of their talk. When he was told, he said: I do not show preference, but give to each what he has aspired to. When, for instance, Kondaa-the Knower in a previous life gave almsfood nine times during a single harvest, he did not aspire to Chief Discipleship; his aspiration was to be the very first to penetrate to the highest state, Arahatship. And so it came about. But when Sariputta and Maha Moggallana many aeons ago, at the time of the Buddha Anomadassi, were born as the brahman youth Sarada and landowner Sirivaddhaka, they made the aspiration for Chief Discipleship. This, O bhikkhus, was the aspiration for these my sons at that time. Hence I have given them just what they aspired to, and did not do it out of preference.
Disciplined life
It was on this day that the Buddha preached a discourse known as Ovada Patimokkha, which established the tradition of the Sangha coming together before the rules of Vinaya. This discourse which is referred to as the basis and the foundation of the Buddhas teachings was delivered on the first Navam full moon day after the enlightenment.
It is said to have created a very disciplined and orderly Sangha Samaja to preserve the doctrine. Ovada Patimokkha was the guiding principle in Sangha life covering the entire sphere of conduct and moral progress of them. Ovada Patimokkha means to give advice.
Bhikkhu Nanamoli recounts Sutta Vibhanga to illustrate this episode in The Life of the Buddha.
Lord, what was the reason why the holy life did not last long in the time of the Blessed Ones Vipassi, Sikhi and Vessabhu
Those Blessed Ones were not forward in teaching the Dhamma to their disciples in detail, and they pronounced few Threads of Argument (Suttas), Songs, Expositions, Stanzas, Exclamations, Sayings, Birth Stories, Marvels, and Questions. No disciples training rule was made known.
The Patimokkha, the Monastic Code, was not lad down. Just as, when various flowers are put on a table without being held together by threads, they easily get scattered, blown away and lost-why is that Because they are not held together with threads  so too, when those Buddhas, those Blessed Ones, and the disciples enlightened by them personally, disappeared, then the disciples mot recently gone forth, various named, of various races and various clans, soon let the holy life lapse. Those Blessed Ones habitually read their disciples minds and advised them accordingly. Once in a certain awe-inspiring jungle thicket the Blessed One Vessabhu, accomplished and fully enlightened, read the minds of the Sangha of Bhikkhus a thousand strong, and this was how he advised and instructed them: Think thus; do no think thus. Give attention thus; do not give attention thus. Abandon this; enter upon and abide in this. Then by following his instructions their hearts were freed from taints through not clinging. And that jungle thicket was one so awe inspiring that normally it would make a mans hair stand on end if he were not free from lust. That was the reason why those Blessed Ones holy life did not last long.
Then the venerable Sariputta rose from his seat, and arranging his robe on one shoulder, he raised his hands palms together towards the Blessed One and said: This is the time, Blessed One, this is the time, Sublime One, for the Blessed One to make known the training rule, to lay down the Patimokkha, so that the holy life may last long.
Wait, Sariputta, wait! The Perfect One will know the time for that. The Master does not make known the disciples training rule or lay down the Patimokkha till certain taint-producing things manifest themselves here in the Sangha. But as soon As they do, then the Teacher will see to both of these, doing so for the purpose of warding off those taint-producing things. Some taint-producing things do not manifest themselves until the Sangha has become great by long establishment and grown large: it is then that they manifest themselves and then that the Teacher makes known the disciples training rule and lays down the Patimokkha for the purpose of warding off those taint-producing things. Some taint-producing things do not manifest themselves till the Sangha has become great by completeness  become great by excessive gain  become great b y learning  But as yet the Sangha is free from infection, free from dangers, it is stainless, pure and consists of heartwood. For of these five hundred Bhikkhus the most backward is a stream-enterer no more subject to perdition, certain of rightness, and destined to enlightenment.
The occasion was this. The Blessed One was living at Savatthi in the palace of Migaras Mother, the Eastern Park. It was then the Uposatha day, and the Blessed One was sitting surrounded by the Sangha of Bhikkhus.
Well on into the night when the first watch was ended, the venerable Ananda rose from his seat, and arranging his robe on one shoulder, he raised his hands palms together towards the Blessed One and said: Lord, it is now well on into the night and the first watch is ended. The Sangha of Bhikkhus has been sitting long. Let the Blessed One recite the Patimokkha to the Bhikkhus.
When this was said, the Blessed One remained silent.
A second time, well on into the night when the second watch was ended, the venerable Ananda rose from his seat, and arranging his robe on one shoulder, he raised his hands palms together towards the Blessed One and said: Lord, it is now well on into the night and the second watch is ended. The Sangha of Bhikkhus has been sitting long. Let the Blessed One recite the Patimokkha to the Bhikkhus.
A second time the Blessed One remained silent.
A third time, well on into the night when the third watch was ended with the red dawn coming up and joy on the face of the night, the venerable Ananda rose from his seat, and arranging his robe on one shoulder, he raised his hands palms together towards the Blessed One and said: Lord, it is now well on into the night and the third watch is ended with the dawn coming up and joy on the face of the night. The Sangha of Bhikkhus has been sitting long. Let the Blessed one recite the Patimokkha to the bhikkhus.
The assembly is not pure, Ananda.
Then the venerable Maha-Moggallana thought: Who is the person referred to by the Blessed One in saying that He read with his mind the minds of the whole Sangha of Bhikkhus. He saw that person, unvirtuous, wicked, unclean, of suspect habits, secretive of his acts, no monk but claiming to be one, not leading the holy life but claiming to do so, rotten within, libidinous and full of corruption, sitting in the midst of the Sangha. He went up to him and said: Get up, friend, you are seen by the Blessed One. For you there is no living in communion with the Sangha of Bhikkhus.
When this was said, that person remained silent. When it was said to him a second and a third time, he remained silent. Then the Venerable Maha-Moggallana took him by the arm and put him outside the door, which he bolted. He went to the Blessed One and said: Lord, I have ejected that person. The assembly is now pure. Let the Blessed One recite the Patimokkha to the Sangha of Bhikkhus.
It is wonderful, Moggallana, it is marvelous how that misguided man waited till he was taken by the arm. Then the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus thus: Bhikkhus, from now on I shall not participate in the Uposatha. I shall not recite the Patimokkha. From now on you yourselves will participate in the Uposatha and recite the Patimokkha. It is impossible, it cannot happen, that a Perfect One should participate in the Uposatha and recite the Patimokkha in an unpurified assembly.
Bhikkhus, there are eight wonderful and marvelous qualities of the great ocean that the asura demons delight in whenever they see them. So too there are eight wonderful and marvelous qualities of this Dhamma and Discipline that Bhikkhus delight in whenever they see them. What are the eight Just as the great ocean gradually slopes and inclines and shelves without any sudden drop, so too in this Dhamma and Discipline there is gradual training and work and practice without any sudden penetration of final knowledge. Again, just as the great ocean is stable and keeps within the limits of its ebb and flow without exceeding them, so too my disciples transgress no training rules made known by me. Again , just as the great ocean will not tolerate a dead body, but, when there is a dead body in it, soon casts it ashore, throws it upon dry land, so too the Sangha does not tolerate a person who is unvirtuous, wicked, of suspect habits, secretive of his acts, no monk but claiming to be one, not leading the holy life but claiming to do so, rotten within, libidinous and full of corruption, but when it has met together it soon throws him out; and even though he may be sitting in the midst of the Sangha, he is yet far from the Sangha and the Sangha is far from him.
Again, just as all the great rivers, the Ganges, the Yamuna, the Aciravati, the Sarabhu and the Mahi, give up their former names and identities when they reach the great ocean, and they come to be reckoned one with the great ocean itself, so too there are these four castes  the warrior-noble khattiyas, the brahmin priests, the burgess vessas and plebeian suddas-and when they have gone forth from the house life into homelessness in the Dhamma and Discipline declared by the Perfect One, they give up their former name and clan and come to be reckoned one with the Bhikkhus who are sons of the Sakyans. Again, just as the great rivers in the world flow into the great ocean, and the rains from the sky fall into it, yet for all that the great ocean is never described as not full or full, so too, though many Bhikkhus attain final Nibbana by the Nibbana element without result of past clinging left, yet for all that the Nibbana element is never described as not full or full. Again, just as the great ocean has one taste, the taste of salt, so too, this Dhamma and Discipline has one taste, the taste of liberation. Again, just as the great ocean holds many and various treasures-there are such treasures in it as pearls, crystals, beryls, shells, marbles, corals, silver, gold, rubies, opals-so too this Dhamma and Disicpline holds many and various treasures there are such treasures in it as the four foundations of mindfulness, the four right endeavours, the four bases for success, the five spiritual faculties, the five powers, the seven enlightenment factors, and the Noble Eightfold Path.
Giving up life
Maha Parinibbana Sutta as translated by Sister Vajira and Francis Story narrates the emotion-filled episode:
9. When this was said, the Blessed One spoke to Mara, the Evil One, saying: Do not trouble yourself, Evil One. Before long the Parinibbana of the Tathagata will come about. Three months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass away.

Justice at last
The long delayed justice on behalf of the prisoners gunned down in Welikada just over four years ago now appears to be a reality, with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe vowing in parliament to bring all those responsible to book. Twenty seven prisoners were killed and another 40 injured in what was widely believed to be a targeted shooting of selected inmates who it was said knew too much about the deeds of the top echelons of power, particularly that of a top Defence official. Credence to this school of thought was provided by a former Senior DIG who was close to the power elites. Speaking to TV cameras at the scene of the massacre, he gave out a list of those killed, all of which strangely belonged to the highly dangerous category, with serious crimes against their names, such as murder, rape and drug peddling. An impression was sought to be created among the public that the gunned down inmates deserved to be eliminated and not fit to live. This was perhaps the blackest episode in our Prisons history ranking alongside the infamous prison massacre in July 83 where over 50 inmates were bludgeoned to death by fellow inmates who were allegedly armed by their jailors.
The Premier, tabling the report of the Commission, appointed by Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in January 2015, which probed Welikada Prisons clash on November 9, 2012, strongly condemned the killings at the Prisons which took place during the Rajapaksa regime. He said he had already instructed the Prisons Reforms Minister to take steps to implement the recommendations contained in the Commission report. A copy of the report had also been forwarded to the IGP, the PM said, adding that Cabinet approval has been sought to pay Rs. 500,000 each as compensation to the family members of the prisoners killed and Rs.100,000 each to the prisoners injured. The Premier further said that parliament would be informed of the future steps the Government intends to take to expose the assassins and steps to be taken against them once the police report into the incident is submitted.
It is hoped that the full gamut of events leading to this horrendous prison massacre has not lost the attention of the commissioners. This is because there were various rumours that were afloat that the prison breakout was stage managed to target specific inmates at the instance of a high ranking Defence official. This is akin to the much publicized round up of criminal elements in the Colombo city, also carried at the instance of the same official, where the same modus-operandi was adopted which saw criminal elements known to be supporters of the UNP were systematically eliminated.
The prison riot occurred a full two years before the present government assumed office and it should also be ascertained why no serious probe was launched into the incident by the Rajapaksa regime. Surely, a crime of such a magnitude warranted a Presidential Commission of Inquiry, no less, some would argue. Were there attempts at a cover up of the whole affair ala a Thajudeen We say this because the same actors involved in the Thajudeen murder cover up also figure prominently in the Welikada massacre. Is this also one link in a chain of a series of killings masterminded by the top echelons of power, given that no effort had been made to unravel the truth behind any of these killings
Be that as it may, monetary compensation on behalf of the Welikada victims is poor consolation to the families and the Yahapalanaya government should strive to do more to make these unfortunates, whose husbands and sons were the victims of the state no less, rebuild their lives although two years has elapsed since the gory happening. Steps should also be taken to reform the prison system in a meaningful way where the de-humanizing of inmates under the parlous conditions of prisons continue.
There had been much talk about introducing the open air prison system that exist in most developed countries where prisoners virtually enjoy freedom of movement, interact frequently with family members and loved ones and is virtually a home away from home. Prisoner safety too should be paid special attention to, given the serious nature of the two prison incidents. The system of rehabilitation, counselling of prisoners too should undergo change in keeping with the modern times and measures worked out to ensure offenders, once released, do not come back to prison. Prison over-crowding which has been a perennial problem should also be dealt with expeditiously and conditions made more congenial for prisoners to lead a normal life. Prison inmates, it need not be stressed, too are human beings who have not chosen prison life out of choice but are the victims of circumstances due to the vagaries and vicissitudes of existence. They certainly do not deserve to be massacred like animals just to make things smooth for the powers that be. Hence, the decision to ferret out all those responsible for this heinous crime should be applauded by all right thinking citizens.

He said there are certain political parties still presenting their proposals for the new constitution.
When we receive all proposals from all parties, we will table the draft in Parliament, Kiriella said.
He also pointed out it was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who said the 13th Amendment wasnt enough.
It was the former President who wanted 13 Plus, Kiriella pointed out.
MP Weerawansa asserted that the new Constitution is a a federal Constitution which fulfils the needs of separatists.
Kiriella in reply said, the government will steer the new Constitution within the provisions of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.

Kohli sparkles as India make Bangladesh suffer
Hyderabad: Murali Vijay backed his red-hot skipper Virat Kohli to pile on the agony for Bangladesh after centuries from both players gave their visitors a harsh introduction to Test cricket in India on Thursday.
India were 356 for three at stumps on the first day of the one-off Test in Hyderabads Uppal Stadium, with Kohli unbeaten on 111 and Ajinkya Rahane also still at the crease on 45. Kohli has scored three double centuries since July and looks well placed to compile yet another mammoth score and compound the misery of the hapless Bangladeshi bowling attack when play resumes on Friday.
Bangladesh conceded 71 runs in the final 10 overs of the day as a rampant Kohli raced to his 16th Test century, capitalising on the solid foundations laid earlier in the day by Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara.
Their second wicket partnership was worth 178 runs, with Vijay ultimately out at 108 and Pujara making 83, as the worlds number one ranked Test team looked to stretch their record-breaking unbeaten run to 19 matches.
Taskin Ahmed, Mehedi Hasan and Taijul Islam shared a wicket each for the visitors but the day belonged firmly to their Indian hosts who elected to bat after winning the toss.
Its always a great sight to see Virat play... He has taken his game to a different level at the moment, Vijay, who shared a 54-run stand with his skipper, told reporters after the close of play.
I thought 340 would be a good score at the end, but he (Kohli) made the extra 10-20 runs possible.
The way he was striking the ball was fantastic. I hope he can come and do the same thing tomorrow.
Bangladesh started the day well as seamer Ahmed bowled Lokesh Rahul for two in the very first over of the match but soon the Indian batsmen started bossing the visitors around the park.
Vijay and Pujara then laid the platform for other batsmen to build on as they took the attack to the opposition. Pujara, who hit two centuries in the recent England series, surpassed former Indian batsman Chandu Bordes domestic record of 1,604 runs in a season during his innings. He was eventually dismissed by teenager Hasan who otherwise remained fairly ineffective against the number one Test teams top order.
Pujara is already a great batsman, and it is really helpful for me to pick his brains... We both think in the same way, said Vijay.
Vijay, who survived a run-out chance on 35, smashed twelve fours and a six during his 160-ball stay before being bowled by Taijul early in the final session.
Kohli, who had walked into loud cheers from the crowd before tea, then piloted the innings with aplomb.
The skipper reached his half century in 70 deliveries and soon galloped to his hundred in the next 60 balls as the Bangladesh bowlers had no answers to his effortless stroke-making. AFP

Lack of bridge puts 200 residents into difficulty
Nearly 200 families in the villages of Karnuggala and Pahalagama are facing inconvenience due to the lack of a bridge across the Ellawala Ganga at the Metihakka landing site.
They said they have to wade through water to cross the river to attend their daily work and other errands. During high tide, they have to traverse a devious two mile route to reach their destinations as crossing the river is difficult and dangerous. Although preparations were made earlier to build a bridge across this spot, the move stopped after completing the surveying work.

Money laundering charges against Namal: AG to file indictments
The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) conducting investigations against six suspects including Hambantota district MP Namal Rajapaksa for their alleged involvement in money laundering amounting to Rs.45 million involving two companies owned by Namal Rajapaksa yesterday informed Court that the Attorney General was expecting to file indictments in the High Court against the suspects.
When the two connected cases filed under money laundering charges came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate J. Trotsky, the FCID said that they have sought the AGs advice regarding the two cases. Further magisterial inquiry into the incident was fixed for June 22.
Four suspects Namal Rajapaksa, Sudarsha Bandara Ganewatta, Nithya Senani and Sujani Bogollagama were present before Court.
They are currently out on bail. Meanwhile, the Additional Magistrate issued open warrants through Interpol for the arrest of two suspects Indika Prabhath Karunajeewa and Iresha Silva who had evaded police investigations since the inception.
The Additional Magistrate further ordered to relax the bail conditions in respect of four suspects including Namal Rajapaksa, enabling them to appear before FCID once in two months instead of the last Sunday of each month.
The FCID had commenced investigation into a complaint that MP Namal Rajapaksa had purchased Hello Corp.Pvt. Ltd for Rs.100 million using ill-gotten funds of Gowers Corporation and NR Consultation Pvt Ltd, allegedly owned by Namal Rajapaksa.
The FCID informed Court that investigations revealed that MP Rajpaksa had been allegedly involved in money laundering to the tune of Rs.15 million at NR Consultation Pvt. Ltd and another Rs.30 million in Gowers Corporation Pvt Ltd, in 2012.
Police alleged that money laundering transactions had taken place through a company named Boston Capital, allegedly owned by Rohan Iriyagolla and he has revealed everything in this regard.
In this case, MP Namal Rajapaksa, Indika Prabhath Karunajeewa, Pavithra Sujani Bogollagama, Senani Samaranayake, Sudarshana Bandara Ganegoda and Iresha Silva were named as the suspects by the FCID, following the instructions of the Attorney General.
It was reported that Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited of Colombo 5, is providing coordinating services to Sri Lankan Airlines.
The FCID had initiated investigations into this matter following a complaint made by Voice Against Corruption Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe.
Samarasinghe alleged that MP Namal Rajapaksa had bought shares of a company named Hello Corp and set up a company called Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited while being a MP, from the Rs.125 million he earned through illegal means.
Presidents Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe with Counsel Sampath Mendis, Senior Counsel Jeewantha Jayatilleke and Counsel Ralitha Amarasena appeared for the suspects.

## Title: Need for reliable witness protection programme in SL

Need for reliable witness protection programme in SL
"In deciding whether or not to include a witness in the WPP, you must consider the seriousness of the offence that the person has witnessed and the nature and importance of the relevant evidence. Officials should also take into accountthe nature of the perceived danger to the witness and the witness relationship to other witnesses being assessed for inclusion in the programme"
As Sri Lanka sets up its transitional justice processes and Truth and Reconciliation Commission, it is important that the country also installs a reliable and trustworthy Witness Protection Programme (WPP) in order to shield witnesses and victims from threats or acts of violence.
To that end, the South Asian Centre for Legal Studies (SACLS) sponsored a closed-door lecture entitled Ensuring Victim and Witness Protection in Transition Justice Mechanisms: Lessons Learnt and Challenges on Tuesday afternoon at the Sri Lanka Foundation.
The lecture was held under the Chatham House Rule, which means that the identity of the speaker may not be divulged. The lecturer was an internationally renowned witness protection expert who has years of experience protecting witnesses and victims across the world. In this article, the speaker will be referred to as Jones.
In the second of his two presentations, Jones covered the essentials for setting up a high functioning WPP and noted that there are a variety of viable forms that witness and victim protection can take. He first drew the distinction between a WPP and witness protection, noting that the former is the more involved form of protection, whereas the latter is a set of institutional practices.
A witness protection programme is the highest form of protection that a country provides. But then you have alternate methods of protection, such as local protection measures.
Its important to have good practice, both by witnesses in how they behave and by law enforcement or others who are dealing with the witness to minimise their exposure to risk. Then there are procedural practices that can be implemented by the court to protect witnesses, he said.
In order for a WPP to be effective, the witness protection set-up must be very well managed. Moreover, a WPP should be used only if the institutional witness protection measures are not enough.
A WPP is the last resort. You need to look at all other types of protection before you put someone into WPP, because these are very resource intensive and expensive programmes. They are only supposed to be used when there is no other avenue to protect someone, he said.
Legislation
While Jones spent some time discussing the institutional practices that contribute to protecting witnesses, he also extensively reviewed the legislation that could create an effective WPP. Needless to say, the set of laws establishing such a programme must be precise and wide-ranging.
First of all, any law will need a clear definition of what qualifies someone as a witness or victim. It should also make clear who can submit an application for witness protection, Jones said.
Furthermore, the laws must qualify how applications are assessed and create an outline for an appeal process if people are rejected or removed from WPPs. Individuals can be removed from a WPP after the conclusion of court proceedings if the situation is deemed safe, but they can also be removed if they misbehave while in the programme.
Its important to write in law how people are removed from the programmes, he said, while adding that there should also be consideration given to how re-identification processes take place.
Anyone can go to a registry and change their name. In various international WPPs, however, countries have the power to make a new entry into the register of births, which effectively creates a new person. This is a very significant form of protection, he said.
While creating a new identity for someone would seem to be an excellent form of protection, it is also very important to put in the legislation that WPPs are neither benefits nor inducements for evidence. Being in a WPP is a very arduous experience, and those who enter into them must know that they should not expect any extra aid through the programme. In fact, they will often have to sacrifice a lot. It should be illegal for WPPs to give any benefits at all. For example, lets take a drivers license. You cant just get someone a drivers license if they dont already have one. You cant give them a skill they dont have.
If someone is relocated, what normally happens is they are put into housing of equivalent standard, and this happens for their safety.
Lots of people who want to be on WPPs think they can forget about their past debts and loans. The legislation should stipulate that every participant will still be responsible for their existing obligations, Jones said.
On top of this, there should also be legislation concerning an external oversight mechanism. If a witness is not happy with how they are being treated, they should be able to go to a separate body to lodge a complaint. Additionally, the laws should establish processes through which various governmental agencies can collaborate to assist people in WPPs.
No WPP can succeed without help from other government agencies. Whether its assisting in changing a name, finding housing, or providing medical care, many government bodies need to be helping each other, Jones said.
Assessment Criteria
It is also crucial that legislation establishes how a person will be assessed for inclusion in any WPP.
In deciding whether or not to include a witness in the WPP, you must consider the seriousness of the offence that the person has witnessed and the nature and importance of the relevant evidence.
Officials should also take into account the nature of the perceived danger to the witness and the witness relationship to other witnesses being assessed for inclusion in the programme, he said.
Moreover, professionals should conduct psychological examinations to gauge the suitability for a witness in the programme and whether there are viable alternative methods of protecting the witness. Officials must also review a witness criminal record, particularly with respect to whether he or she has committed violent crimes and is a risk to the public. When looking at people who are applying to WPPs, we are looking at putting procedures in place to protect them. This can pose a risk to you, the staff that deals with them, and the programme itself. Thats why assessments should be in depth, and I believe its necessary, he said.
Witness Protection Programme Essentials
When conducting a WPP, Jones reiterated the essential point that no witness is bigger than the programme. In order for a WPP to strengthen a judicial process, which is part of its work, it has to protect people who buy into the process. You cannot have someone on a WPP who puts himself or herself at unnecessary risk. If a witness is not behaving properly and is placing themselves and the staff, or the entire program in danger, they should no longer be in the programme no matter how important they are. You have to have a programme that can stand up to scrutiny.
If someone who is on programme is harmed or killed, it will have a significant impact on future court procedures and investigations. As a WPP officer, you really dont want the public to think you lack the ability to protect witnesses and victims, he said.
Likewise, it is essential to create comprehensive operating procedures that support legislation. These standard procedures should not be made publicly available, since they are the methods by which a country protects people.
It follows, then, that WPPs need competent people working within them. Well-trained people are crucial to a functioning WPP. Plenty of information goes into the WPP bubble, but nothing should go out. The minute you start leaking information you have nothing, he said. The theme of teamwork across government agencies is key, as Jones relayed how protection services for a witness are often times delegated to local police or military forces when that person goes to and comes back from court.
You also need to have proper external oversight that is separate from the functions of the court, as well as a corruption resistance plan to make sure everyone is behaving properly, he said. While it is certainly difficult to be in any WPP, it is especially arduous if one is relocated due to safety concerns. When this happens, WPPs must work especially hard to make the witness or victim feel comfortable. The officers must also keep the witness or victim from trying to get back in touch with those from his or her former life.
People often have to avoid contacting their family and friends when they are relocated. Its like getting a new life. We want to form relationships with people wherein we can openly discuss difficulties. Its important to develop a relationship where witnesses can be open with you and tell you the truth, he said.
That being said, officers are expected to maintain their professional distance: Witnesses are sometimes totally reliant on you. Its vital to maintain your professional distance, and for this you need monitoring systems.
While it is not an easy task to create and maintain a WPP, it is a crucial aspect of Sri Lankas path to reconciliation. WPPs strengthen judicial processes and ensure the publics faith that witnesses will be protected. Sri Lanka certainly has its work cut out for it in inaugurating its own WPP.

Ousted Maldives leader vows to return to power

Colombo: Ousted former Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed has vowed to contest the next presidential election in 2018, saying the 2012 coup that forced him to live in exile had failed to crush his spirit.
In an interview in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo where he was busy reorganising his Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), Nasheed said he would expose the alleged money laundering rings and drug-running cartels that supposedly fuel the current administration led by current President Abdulla Yameen in the picturesque island nation.
Nasheed became the first democratically-elected president of Maldives in 2008 in a historic election that saw him end Maumoon Abdul Gayoom's 30-year rule.
He then resigned from top slot in February 2012 under duress following what is largely referred to as an opposition-backed military coup.

Hyatt Project leased on annual rental of SL Rs. 10,000 for a period of 99 years: Finance Minister
The much controversial Hyatt Hotel Project case came under spotlight at yesterdays Parliamentary session, when JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa posed a question regarding the lease basis, tender and consultancy services of the Hyatt Hotel project.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the total land with regard to the Hyatt Hotel project in Colpetty was given out on an annual nominal lease rental of Rs.10,000, being lawful money of Sri Lanka for a period of 99 years.
Questioned by MP Jayatissa as to who in the previous government forwarded a Cabinet Paper regarding the lease of land, Minister Karunanayake said, to his understanding, the Cabinet Paper in this regard was tabled by the former Finance Minister.
The former Finance Minister aka former President Mahinda Rajapaksa tabled the Cabinet Paper regarding the lease. Minister Karunanayake said.
MP Jayatissa too directed the attention of the House that it is only through an irregularity that a plot of land situated in the heart of Colombo be leased for such a small amount of lease fee, for such a long period of time.
Minister Ravi Karunanayake also said the FCID was currently looking into the large scale misappropriation and irregularities of funds and malpractices which allegedly had taken place in the construction of the Hyatt Hotel projects in Colpetty.
Minister Karunanayake alleged that Gamini Senarat, the former Chairman of M/s Canwill Holdings Ltd., that owns the Hyatt Hotel project, attempted to influence the operation of the project and tactically disturbed the ongoing investigations as well.
Certain people in this project who are not in power, are still acting as if they were in power, Minister Karunanayake alleged.
Minister Karunanayake also said that it was quite difficult to get the names behind the alleged malpractices to the surface. The procedure regarding this whole project is unspecified, he further said.
Minister Karunanayake also said the project had been used as a private property.
He also said, it has been very difficult to obtain the necessary documents, details and data which are relevant to the malpractice probe, due to these external influences. Karunanayake also pointed out that the foundation stone laying ceremony of the Hyatt Hotel project in Colpetty, had cost Rs.7 million.
These are only the official data. If we speak on unofficial calculations, the cost amounts ten times that had been mentioned, Minister Karunanayake said.
The Hyatt Hotel project is owned by M/s Canwill Holdings Ltd., which is a fully government owned public enterprise. 46% of its shares are held by Sri Lanka Insurance, while the rest is equally shared by the EPF, and the Litro Gas Company under the Finance Ministry each holding 27 percent of the shares.
Probe on CBs expenses spent in purchasing of properties included in Order Paper
A proposal to appoint a Parliament Select Committee to look into and report on the expenses incurred by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for the purchasing of properties in Brazil and the USA, had been included into the Order Paper of Parliament.
The Resolution was presented by JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti, requesting the PSC to look into the purchasing of the Office for the Sri Lankan Embassy in Brazil and the Office for the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations, NewYork,USA.
Nineteen MPs namely Dr Nalinda Jayatissa, Bimal Ratnayake, Mylbanagam Tilakarajah, M A Sumanthiran, Mayantha Dissanayake, Vadivel Suresh, Nalin Bandara Jayamaha, Hector Appuhamy, Tusitha Wijemanne, Ananda Aluthgamage, J C Alawathuwala, Sidney Jayaratne, Sujith Sanjaya Perera, K K Piyadasa,Ashu Marasinghe, Sandith Samarasinghe, Aravindh Kumar, LakshmanWijemanne and Ananda Kumarasiri had signed the resolution.
The PSC would also probe whether these purchases were duly authorized, the amount incurred on each of these premises and the officers by name who were responsible for and/or instructed the purchasing of these premises.
The Committee is expected to present its report to Parliament of the date of its first sitting.
Sooriyawewa Stadium construction costs left unsettled: COPE Chairman: No party willing to take responsibility
The construction cost of the Sooriyawewa Stadium had been left unsettled as no party was willing to accept its responsibility, Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) Chairman Sunil Handunnetti said.
He made this observation while addressing a press conference at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday, to brief the latest COPE report on 15 public enterprises.
Handunnetti said the officials of both Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), shirked responsibility concerning payments for the costs incurred in the construction of the stadium when they were summoned before COPE.
The interest of the amount to be settled was increasing day by day. This stadium has become a burden to the countrys economy. We would soon be in a position when we would not be in position to settle the debts from the funds earned by playing cricket. The SLC says that they did not ask for that stadium, while the SLPA which built it, says it does not need a stadium, MP Handunnetti said.
When COPE inquired, SLC officials said the initial estimation for the construction of the stadium was Rs 1.2 billion. Later on, the cost had increased to Rs 2.8 billion. Then again another bill of Rs 4.2 billion was forwarded to the Board of Control for Cricket for settlement. Construction of the stadium had been undertaken by the SLPA and later on it was submitted to the China Harbour by them. The SLC had at time taken a decision to develop and promote the stadium, Handunnetti explained.
COPE observed that there was a failure to obtain the assistance of the Valuation Department to get a comprehensive valuation report with regard to the Sooriyawewa Stadium. A private company named KPMG had been assigned the task of carrying out the valuation.
SLC officials had informed COPE that the capital expenditure was indicated at Rs 5.4 billion at present even though it was indicated as Rs 4.2 billion three years ago.
GMOA members earn money by private practice, but oppose SAITM: Justice Minister
Buddha Sasana and Justice Minister Dr. Wijayadasa Rajapakshe yesterday in Parliament, slammed the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) over its stance on the SAITM, while also exposing the hypocrisy behind those objections.
The members of the GMOA make enormous amounts of money through private practice, but at the same time, they oppose the Malabe Private Medical College, he said.
The minister was participating in the debate on Regulations under the National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act.
I would wish to question those who shout concerning the standards of the private medical colleges as to why they do not show the same concern on the standards of government medical faculties. The GMOA calls the SAITM a degree selling shop, but who are those who teach at the SAITM The very same doctors of the GMOA teach at the SAITM. There are some children of GMOA members studying in it. It is not the businessmen of the Mariya Kade in Maradana who teach there at the SAITM, but senior doctors. Had Mahinda Rajapaksa continued to be the President of this country today, we may find GMOA officials acting like lapdogs and tamed kittens. It is the duty of the government to provide opportunities for higher education without limits, the minister stated.

The Speaker said he held discussions concerning this issue with several MPs including party leaders. The latest situation was assessed before making the decision to call for additional security for the MP.
Several MPs have met me and forwarded this issue to me. I had discussed it with MP Sumanthiran too. Thereafter I informed the relevant security authorities to take measures to assure his safety and to increase the security detailed to him, the Speaker told the House.
Minister Kiriella denies having advisors working under him
Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella yesterday, denied having a long list of advisors operating under him who were attached to the Road Development Authority(RDA). The one year service period under which these advisors were recruited is already over, Kiriella pointed out.
They no longer work under me. The appointments were only temporary, he said.
The Leader of the House made these observations when his name was mentioned by Joint Opposition MP Udayashantha Gunasekara, during the oral answers session in Parliament regarding a question directed from Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
MP Udhayashantha questioned the Finance Minister on the number of coordinating secretaries, consultants and other staff that had been appointed to the Finance Ministers staff.
Replying to the question raised, Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the number of coordinating secretaries, consultants and other staff was maintained at a minimum.
There were only two coordinating secretaries, one consultant and fourteen other staff, Minister Karunanayake said.
Questioned as to whether the Finance Ministry had any unofficial appointments as consultants or secretaries, Minister Karunanayake said such unofficial and unlawful appointments stopped after the last Presidential election.
The Finance Ministry has taken nothing unlawfully or unofficially, he said.

Ravi complains of mole in CB
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday in Parliament complained of leaking inside information of the Central Bank to the media.
The minister expressed his concerns that certain high ranking officials of the CB were behind this move. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said he would bring this matter to the attention of the CB Governor.
Minister Karunanayake quoting a news article in a Sunday English paper said; The article carried under the title Request to appoint outsider as CB Deputy Governor: Monetary Board examines proposal from Finance Minister, was not correct. This was not taken up. I would like to see as to who passed this information to the media. Now an independent inquiry is being conducted into this. Only five Monetary Board members were present at the above meeting including one Deputy Governor and one other official that was invited.
This is not the first time that such information has gone to the media. Finance Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S.Samaratunga, who is an ex-officio member of the Monetary Board, said how this has come out to the paper is unknown. Right or wrong is not the problem here, but how it got out. I request the Speaker to immediately inquire the minister said. UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena requested a two day debate to discuss the problems in the CB, so that the truth about those matters would prevail. However, Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella objected to the suggestion stating that a separate debate is not needed as a full day debate was held on the COPE report on a previous day.
Minister Karunanayake also brought to the attention of the House that all the 15 institutions mentioned in the latest COPE report were making profits under the administration of the present Government. Some media reports into the COPE findings were misleading. The loss mentioned in the report was related to 2012-2014. The COPE Chairman should have clarified this fact in the report he said.

Rice price down in few days, predicts Amunugama
The price of rice will come down within the next few days with the introduction of the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) for three varieties of rice by the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA), Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said.
The CAA introduced the MRP for three varieties of rice from Wednesday issuing an extraordinary gazette notification to curtail the price of rice. Accordingly, a kilo of Nadu will be sold at Rs. 72 and a kilo of Samba at Rs. 80.
The government has taken measures to import 150,000 MT of rice with immediate effect aiming to bring down the price of rice. The imported rice will arrive in the country in the next few days and the price of rice will come down, the minister said.
Dr. Amunugama said rice production has come down this Maha season due to the prevailing drought.
Rice production had come down by 40 to 50 percent this year compared with last year. Meanwhile, the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) has set a guaranteed price for paddy aiming to protect paddy farmers. Under this, a kilo of Nadu paddy is purchased at Rs. 38 and Samba at Rs. 42. However, the PMB purchases only 10 to 12 percent of the total annual paddy production of the country at the moment, he said.
The minister said 258,000 MT of rice imported from India by Lanka Sathosa during the previous regime was stored in their stores for a long period. Sathosa had to later sell the rice as animal food as Sathosa had failed to utilise it, the minister said.
Investigations revealed that this huge amount of rice was imported from a single rice exporter in India, he said.

Role of Independence in an interchanging World Order
Geographic facts do not change, but their meaning for foreign policy will. - Nicholas J. Spykman
A new world order has begun with roles interchanging. United States as the leader of the free world and the architect of globalization is advocating nationalism while China who earlier spoke about national values is now praising globalization. President Xi during his visit to Davos clearly gave leadership toward the case of globalization.
According to President Xi, There was a time when China also had doubts about economic globalization, and was not sure whether it should join the World Trade Organisation. But we came to the conclusion that integration into the global economy is a historical trend. To grow its economy, China must have the courage to swim in the vast ocean of the global market. If one is always afraid of bracing the storm and exploring the new world, he will sooner or later get drowned in the ocean. Therefore, China took a brave step to embrace the global market. We have had our fair share of choking in the water and encountered whirlpools and choppy waves, but we have learned how to swim in this process. It has proved to be a right strategic choice.
Back in the 60s US positions on boundaries was explained clearly by President Kennedy in Berlin in his remarkable oration ich bin ein berliner there should be one Berlin, the iron curtain that divided nations will fall one day and it did fall in 1989. It took 30 years for United States to change its position to build a wall and confine to its boundary. Back in the ancient history, China exercised its power and developed a wall Great Wall to secure from outside invaders. Today, the US is revisiting what China did several thousand years ago and China has evolved as a nation in this regard.
Military power
In geopolitics it is vital to understand the politics of borders and frontiers. According to Robert Kaplan the ability of states to control events will be diluted, in some cases destroyed. Artificial borders will crumble and become more fissiparous, leaving only rivers, deserts, mountains, and other enduring facts of geography. Indeed, the physical features of the landscape may be the only reliable guides left to understanding the shape of future conflict.
Yale Professor Nicholas Spykman explained in his Rim Land theory the arc surrounding the heartland of Halford J. Mackinder is where tectonics shifts will occur and nations will use their military power in this important crescent. In the 20th century, most wars from Korean War, Vietnam, India - Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Balkan wars were fought on this Rim Land. The next possible war could also trigger from South China Sea an area of the Rim Land.
It was the capture of greater Caribbean by US Navy after the Indian wars which unlocked the power of US from Panama Canal which was the most significant strategic project. Two oceans the Atlantic and Pacific was controlled with US military strength and NATO was the platform to take forward liberal democratic values as a coalition.
In the same manner one could examine the case of China who is seeking a historical claim of the South China Sea to unlock its power in Indian Ocean. Like in the past in the greater Caribbean region, the US held Panama. Today China has OBOR (One Belt One Road) with a $890b investment with 900 projects along the belt and road. A revival of what China had during the past.
Corruption Perception Index
The North Atlantic power Axis is clearly turning towards the East. While the newly elected President Trump who has mentioned NATO is obsolete and challenge its values. China will gain a better control and win more allies in the East. Liberal democracy will be seen by Asians as a model that does not deliver efficient results. Asia could drift towards a technocracy a model operated by technical experts and expert government servants which deliver quick results.
China has proven clearly more than the 100 liberal democracies around the world that 625m people were taken out of poverty from this model. Singapore has proven as an East Asian miracle performing through a meritocracy at its highest value delivering results to the public. The public health, water safety, education, infrastructure and all economic indicators are at the highest level. Corruption Perception Index which was release few weeks ago indicates Singapore at 7th place while Sri Lanka is at 95th place worse than last year.
The concept of a technocracy will be something to look at to improve on many sectors of the nation. Senior Research Fellow Parag Khanna from LKY school says increasingly, Asians favour pragmatic, outcome-oriented governance, and prefer to be ruled by civil servants rather than politicians a prediction that Asia could turn to technocrats and depart western democracy.
Western empire
Duality and double standards were a significant factor in erupting the course of glory of the western empire. It happens within the Nation and not from outside. The double standards on Human Rights, Democratic values and much more are clear indicators that people has lost trust with their own systems. Waterboarding is not torture, its one step below torture says Trump who wish to be the core members of NATO who is against torture. A nation like Sri Lanka is accused by a group (ICTJP) Executive Director Yasmin Sooka for abduction and torture. UKs Sir John Chilcot report which created much noise about British soldiers committing war crimes in Iraq which accused Prime Minister at that time, has gone completely silent. Certain western experts accuse the Sri Lankan military and suggesting foreign judges in a Hybrid court.
Stratfor Global Intelligence, one of the leading US security think tanks in the world recently published an article about Sri Lanka which explained Despite its small size Sri Lanka holds substantial strategic value by virtue of its geographic position: it is at the centre of Asias busiest maritime routes and has a wealth of natural deep harbours. It further points out Sri Lankan Government owes Beijing $8b more than 12% of its $64.9b debt.
Upon celebrating Sri Lankas 69th year of independence, it is important to clearly identify our internal and external geopolitical threats as a nation with the hope of charting our path towards a developed nation.

Salawa armoury blast: Many displaced yet to get compensation
Although eight months have passed since the Salawa armoury blast, a majority of the displaced and affected people have not received compensation as promised, Salawa Janatha Pavura Organisation Secretary Mahesh Kumarasinghe said.
He was addressing a media briefing held in the area to highlight the plight of the members of his organisation who were displaced by the Salawa blast.
Kumarasinghe said even though the authorities promised to exempt affected people from the electricity, water and telephone bills, they are still receiving the bills from the institutions as before. He said people, whose partly damaged houses were hastily repaired by the Army, find it difficult to live in them as the cracks have reappeared due to a roughshod job.
He said there is such a fear psychosis among their children that they get agitated even for the sound of a fire cracker. He said only Rs. 100,000 was paid to the family of one person buried under a collapsing wall of his house. He said when they complain that compensation payments were inadequate, the Divisional Secretary of the area ask the applicants to go to court if they object to the government valuation. He said high handed action of certain officials were messing up things harming the government's good intentions.

Madrid: Five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova has been handed a wildcard for the Madrid Open in May just weeks after completing a 15-month ban for doping, organisers confirmed on Wednesday.

In Madrid she always plays well and Im sure she will come back to the courts highly motivated and hoping to do well in her first tournaments.
Sharapova hasnt played on tour since testing positive for meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open.
However, her initial two-year ban by the International Tennis Federation, was reduced to 15 months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
Sharapova is one of those players that all tennis fans want to see, added tournament CEO Gerard Tsobanian.

Sixty percent Colombo schools mosquito breeders
Health authorities have discovered mosquito breeding sites in 102 (60 percent) of schools, including some leading schools in the Colombo district. A total of 9,886 dengue cases and 12 deaths have been reported during this year, Health Ministry sources said.
According to sources, there has been an increase in the number of dengue cases reported from nine( the Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Jaffna, Baticaloa, Kalumunai, Galle, Matara and Ratnapura), districts.

SL and Pakistan called to break stalemate in SAARC

Pakistan and Sri Lanka have come together and called for breaking the stalemate in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), and emphasised that the forum should be kept intact despite the ongoing differences.
A logical and peaceful demand, in the face of an aggressive India, whose refusal to attend the last SAARC conference in Pakistan last year has made the SAARC almost redundant.
A panel discussion on SAARC: Its Impediments and Way Forward, was organised by the High Commission of Pakistan in Sri Lanka and the premier national security think tank, Institute of National Security Studies Sri Lanka (INSSSL), where workable solutions to longstanding issues such as the conflict between Pakistan and India on Kashmir were discussed.
Pakistan has time and again displayed goodwill on its part and expressed its desire to initiate dialogue. Last month, Pakistan sent back an Indian soldier who crossed the Line of Control, on humanitarian grounds.
India has responded to this kind gesture by indulging in unprovoked cross border firing, violating the LoC despite our protests, killing an innocent man belonging from the Khuiratta sector.
Pakistans Ministry of Foreign affairs said in a statement, Despite Indian belligerence, Pakistan believes in peaceful neighbourhood and rejects all actions aimed at undermining regional peace and security, and Indias provocations are on display for the international community, no matter the rhetoric it cooks up in its media.
As an organisation, SAARC does not tackle the bilateral issues of India and Pakistan, a condition built into its charter, making it a non-threatening forum for regional trade and peace.
Indian resistance to meeting Pakistan at SAARC is petty and selfish.
India maybe prepared to throw it all away to appease a political party of extremists, but other member states should realise the benefits of the forum as a non-controversial platform to erect some semblance of good will upon.

SL consider releasing Indian trawlers
The Fisheries Ministry has paid attention to releasing a few of the 42 Indian trawlers taken into custody by Sri Lanka in the Northern seas in 2015 after consulting Northern fishermen.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera disclosed this at a meeting with a group of representatives from the Northern Fisheries Community at his ministry yesterday.
The minister said so far, the number of poaching Indian trawlers seized and forfeited stood at 128. Of them, 43 trawlers were seized in 2015.
It was decided to release a few of them but it would be done only after consulting the Northern fishermen and obtaining their approval.
A ministry release stated fisheries community representatives from the North who participated in the meeting requested the minister to refrain from releasing any of the seized Indian trawlers until they got back to the ministry after consulting the fishery community in the North about their views on the proposal.
The minister said nothing would be done without consulting the fishery community and obtaining their views.
The fisheries community representatives requested the minister to institute court action against the owners of the seized Indian trawlers or their agents.
They also requested that all Indian fishermen arrested and remaining in custody be released forthwith and hold back the release of Indian trawlers until Tamil Nadu fishing vessels totally halted poaching in Sri Lankan waters in the North.

SL doesnt produce those champions of the past:Jayasuriya

Analysing Sri Lankas recent poor run on foreign shores, former skipper and current chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya on Thursday lamented that in recent times, the country has failed to produce any of the champion cricketers of the past.
I wouldnt say theres a dearth of talent but we dont produce those champion cricketers as much as we did in the past, Jayasuriya was quoted as saying by espncricinfo.
I dont think its a problem with the domestic structure or the school structure, because its the very system that produced all those champion cricketers in the past. So, we need to assess this situation and find out where the problem is and correct it, said the southpaw, who amassed 13430 runs from 445 ODIs and 6973 runs from 110 Tests.
The 47-year-old Jayasuriya, who was once a part of the dreaded batting line-up comprising Marvan Atapattu, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan, said as international players, the islanders should be able to adjust and play under any conditions.
We should be able to play under any conditions, not just at home. Theres no point giving excuses or blaming our domestic structure after we lose a series. Your success depends on how fast you adjust to these conditions but sadly we have taken too long to do that, he said.
The problem I see here is not lack of talent but their inability to adjust quickly to situations and handle the pressure. You cant play cricket, if you cant absorb pressure.
In their ongoing tour to South Africa, the Lankans have only managed to win the T20 International series 2-1, but have been clean-swept in the Tests, and are presently 0-4 in the five-match One-day International (ODI) serie
