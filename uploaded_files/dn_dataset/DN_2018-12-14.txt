Political powers to provincial councils; cornerstone to separatism
Parliamentarian Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said that granting political powers to provincial councils would lead to the creation of separate states in the country.
He was peaking at a press conference held in Colombo, yesterday.
Abeywardena said that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has promised to the Tamil National Alliance that he would give political powers to provincial councils.
He added that the power delegated to provincial councils under the Provincial Councils Act was more than enough for a Chief Minister to carry out development work.
Wickremesinghe has promised the abolition of Presidential powers, Abeywardena said, The President is the symbol of unitary status; the country cannot be divided as long as the Executive Presidency remains intact, he said.
He added that the country was in danger as United National Party Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe wanted to divide it.
He added that he was one of the two parliamentarians who opposed the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.
I was the chief minister of the Southern Province for seven years; I rendered an excellent service using the existing powers, he said, Schools and roads were developed using the councils funds.

World Prematurity Day at Ninewells
Ninewells Hospital celebrated World Prematurity Day 2018 recently; drawing attention to the importance of taking steps to reduce preterm births and caring for prematurely born babies In order to avoid future complications. The event which was held at the hospital premises was attended by families with Premature Babies, the Ninewells Hospital Board of Directors, Doctors, Nurses and other Staff Members.
Premature births are considered to be a serious health concern and is one of the leading causes of death in children under the age of five around the world. Compared to babies born on time, prematurely born babies may face long-term health problems that affect their brain, lungs, hearing or vision if they do not receive proper care.
A preterm birth is when babies are born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy and such a condition can have serious health implications on the child in the long run. Globally, preterm births are on the rise and therefore, the need to create awareness to avoid this condition and awareness about the importance of providing proper care to prematurely born babies to avoid future health complications is extremely vital, said Dr. Nalin Gamaathige, Consultant Neonatal Paediatrician. As a hospital that specialises in childcare, Ninewells Hospital is equipped with the best caregivers and facilities to ensure that prematurely born babies receive the optimal medical attention.
The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the Hospital provides specialised care to prematurely born infants.The babies receiveoptimum care till they are out of danger and are ready to be reunited with their families, said Dr. Vibash Wijeratne, Medical Director  Ninewells Hospital.
World Prematurity Day is a global movement which is celebrated in November to raise awareness on premature births and on avoiding itsdevastating impact on families.
Some common reasons for preterm birth include multiple pregnancies, infections and chronic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and genetic influences. Often, however, no cause is identified.
Preventing preterm births and avoiding the complications that it brings,often start with a healthy pregnancy. Receiving proper care before, during and in between pregnancies with reliable health professionals who provide advice and guidance throughout the experience, is vital.

## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Friday, December 14, 2018 - 01:00
Freeloaders in dogs
Parasites are freeloaders that live in or on another creature. Common parasites in dogs are ticks, lice and fleas.
Fleas
Fleas are small dark brown insects prefer temperatures of 65-80 degrees and humidity levels of 75-85 percent and found on dogs more likely to be a problem during warm-weather months. Generally, unlike the burrowing, microscopic Demodex or Scabies Mites, fleas of about the size of the head of a pin can be seen scurrying along the surface of the skin.
Understanding the Flea Life Cycle
There are several stages to its life cycle: egg, larva or caterpillar, pupa or cocoon, and adult. The length of time it takes to complete this cycle varies depending upon the environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and the availability of a nourishing host. The adult female flea typically lives for several weeks on the pet, suck the animals blood two to three times and then lay twenty to thirty eggs each day. These eggs fall off of the pet into the yard, bedding, carpet, and wherever else the animal spends time. The egg then hatches into larvae. These tiny worm-like larvae live among the carpet fibers, in cracks of the floor, and outside in the environment. They feed on organic matter, skin scales, and even the blood-rich adult flea feces. The larvae grow, molt twice and then form a cocoon and pupate, waiting for the right time to hatch into an adult. They can survive quite a long time, waiting until environmental conditions and host availability are just right. The newly emerged adult flea can jump onto a nearby host immediately. The entire life cycle is just fourteen days.
Signs
The dog repeatedly scratches and chews the skin and when you observe you may actually see tiny brown fleas moving quickly through your dogs hair coat. Constant scratching may lead to visible patches of hair loss and reddened, irritated skin. Fleas may also cause skin allergies and can transmit other parasites, such as tapeworms, to your dog. Fleas dislike light so looking for them within furry areas, groin, armpits and base of the tail, belly and inner thighs will provide your best chances of spotting them.
Flea developing areas
The fleas may reproduce in Carpets, pet bedding, furniture, and other indoor areas where your dog spends much time. Fleas also develop in shady, protected outdoor areas where your dog likes to rest and relax.
Spread
Dogs and cats often get infested with fleas through contact with other animals or contact with fleas in the environment. The strong back legs of this insect enable it to jump from host to host or from the environment onto the host.
Diagnosis - Flea test at home
You can look for "flea dirt". "Flea dirt" looks like dark specks of pepper scattered on the skin surface. If you see flea dirt, which is actually flea feces and is composed of digested blood, pick some off the pet and place on a wet paper towel. If after a few minutes the tiny specks spread out like a small blood stain, it's definitely flea dirt and your pet has fleas!
Lice
Lice are species-specific; those that thrive on human blood wont change their dining preferences if they land on a dog, or vice versa. Dog lice are small, flat, wingless six-legged insects that live in the hair. They survive on skin debris, sebaceous secretions, feathers, or the blood of the host animal. Adult lice are large enough to be visible to the naked eye, roughly the size of a sesame seedabout 3 millimetersand are yellow to tan in color. They are sometimes mistaken for dandruff. Lice have limited mobility; they can crawl, but are unable to jump, hop, or fly. Lice are found mostly on animals that are old, sick, stray, or feral
Life cycle
There are several stages in the life cycle such as egg, nymph and adult. The cycle starts when the female lays tiny yellow or white eggs at the base of the hair shaft. These eggs are glued to the hair. It takes about a week for the eggs to hatch, releasing the immature lice, known as nymphs, which are no larger than the head of a pin. After about a week, they enter the adult phase, starting the cycle all over again. The entire life is about 30 days.
Signs
There may be itching, pain, inflammation, rough, dry, or matted coat, hair loss specifically around ears, neck, shoulders, groin, and rectal regions, small wounds or infections from bites by sucking lice, anemia in extreme cases or in small dogs and puppies, scratching, rubbing and/or biting at skin, restlessness, skin redness, irritation, lethargy, weight loss, poor development in severely infested pups
Spread
Lice spread through direct contact. Locations where dogs are in close contact such as dog parks, boarding kennels, grooming facilities and animal shelters are all possible places pets can contract lice.
Treatment, prevention and control of external parasites
Two methods of manual and chemical control are widely effective to control external parasites all over the world.
1. Frequent vacuuming dog sitting areas and frequent washing of your dogs bedding can greatly reduce the number of developing parasites inside your home.
2. Both indoor and outdoor areas can be sprayed with insecticides to eliminate parasite. Insecticide treatments will kill one stage of the life cycle, so will have to be repeated at regular intervals for a month or more.
3. Giving your dog extra omega-3 fatty acid supplements with the diet will help to improve skin health.
4. Using a comb (a comb made with very close-set teeth) will physically pull parasites from the dogs body.
5. Pills and other spot-on chemical treatments have proven to be some of the fastest ways to rid your pet of parasite. Tablets works within 30-minutes and kills 90 per cent of all parasites within four hours. Spot-on treatments tend to take a few days to work, and some only target eggs while other target adults, so it's important to buy the right one.
6. Wearing a collar containing medicine also an effective method.
7. There are several shampoos for dogs in the market that are quite effective. Your pet can stand being soaking wet and lathered up for ten minutes and use a comb to remove the parasite from your dog.
8. All dogs in the household whether they are not affected should be treated.
9. Pets require supplementation with iron, vitamins and minerals to address anemia

Age no bar
Durga Kami walks for over an hour everyday to reach school and hang out with his 14-year-old classmates; finishing school had always been a dream, so after a decade of being a widower, he decided to go back to the classroom.
Poverty prevented Kami finishing his studies as a child and achieving his goal of becoming a teacher. Now at age 68, the father of six and grandfather of eight goes to school six days a week to complete his studies and escape a solitary home life following the death of his wife.
The buzz created by the children in the Shree Kala Bhairab higher secondary school stands in stark contrast to the quietude of Kamis isolated one-room home, with its leaky roof and frequent power cuts.
To forget my sorrows I go to school, says Kami, one of the oldest students in Nepal.
Kami, whose children have all left his hilltop home, first went to Kaharay primary school where he learnt to read and write with the seven and eight-year-old students before leaving after finishing grade five with the 11-year-olds; he now studies with 14-15 year olds.
Shree Kala Bhairab teacher D R Koirala then invited Kami to his school, which provided the grandfather with stationary and a school uniform including grey trousers, blue striped tie and white shirt.
This is my first experience teaching a person who is as senior as my fathers age, Koirala said.
I feel very excited and happy.
The school scholarship does not stretch to cover food, though, meaning Kamis breakfast of rice with a fermented green vegetable known as Gundruk must sustain him until dinner.
The 20 children in his grade 10 class have dubbed Kami Baa, which means father in Nepali, but despite his age their elderly class mate joins in all activities, including volleyball in the schoolyard.
I used to think why is this old man coming to school to study with us but as time passed I enjoyed his company, Kamis 14-year-old class mate Sagar Thapa said.
He is a little bit weak in studies compared to us but we help him out with that.
Kami said he wanted to study until his death, adding he hoped it would encourage others to ignore age obstacles.
If they see an old person with white beard like me studying in school they might get motivated as well, he said.

Brit Bashing and ducks in Kiwi ponds- will the course reverse
They were thrashed. Yes, Sri Lanka were soundly thrashed by England in the Three Test matches. And now the hope is that as Sri Lanka fronts up to the New Zealanders in the First of Two Test, beginning at the Basin Reverse,Wellington tomorrow will our team erase the Brit bashing and get back to winning ways If the Lankans believe in themselves remembering that the New Zealanders also have their ups and downs and as we take the field there are fears that the Lankans may not do well. Can we turn the tables
In the warm up game in Napier, the Lankan batsmen were a sad sight. While picturesque New Zealand has beautiful duck ponds it seemed as if the Lankans were competing as six of them having ducks for supper! Maybe the cold conditions would have contributed to the sorry batting effort. But that excuse will not hold.
However the much maligned former Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews showed that he is not at all perturbed by the step motherly treatment meted out to him and hit back with a vengeance with a stylishly carved out century. This is the hallmark of a great cricketer and sportsman.
It was a three figure score made According to Mathew that brought to mind the film  According to Mathew- running to crowded house in theatres in the country. Mathews will have to spread the gospel to his batting team mates and get them to perform accordingly by showing the way, occupying the wicket and getting the batsmen to score around him.
The Sri Lankan think-tanks will not want to name the playing eleven until they have a look at the wicket and the conditions on the morning of the Test. But hazarding a guess it is likely that vice captain Dimuth Karunaratne will have Dhanushka Gunetilleke with him to face the new ball.
Batsmen following Kusal Mendis, Dhananajaya de Silva, captain Dinesh Chandimal, Roshen Silva and Niroshan Dickwella must make it their business to contribute with big scores.
It is hoped that they have shed their hit about sloven approach and will buckle down to playing what is required of the longer version of the game playing straight which is what batting is all about in the established game.
This call goes out to wicket keeper batsman Niroshan Dickwella and it hoped that he will play his flowing strokes which he has all round the wicket and not resort to keep playing the ugly reverse stroke. Test cricket demands that it be respected and played that way As for the bowing, with the wicket and conditions likely to be swing friendly, new ball bowlers who are likely to be Suranga Lakmal, Nuwan Pradeep and Lahiru Kumara. While offie Dilruwan Perera will lead the spin
bite, it hoped that the selectors will persist with Lakshan Sandakan. Lakshan, according to the writer can be a match winner with more exposure. What will ultimately matter and stand between victory and defeat will be the fielding. Lankas fielding, especially the catching has been below village green. A wag said that their hands could be frozen in the cold in windy Wellington, but spilt catches will have no excuse. Excuses however good are unacceptable once in the big league.
As for the Kiwis they must be having that over the moon feeling after their grand success in the desert where they cut the high riding Pakistanis to size in the Test series. It was a victory to savour and the Kiwis will carry that confidence into this Test.
The Kiwis will be the better team performing on their home turf. They have a fine all round side and are far ahead of the visitors in every aspect led cleverly by the heavy scoring captain Kane Willimson. Williamson signed off with a classic century in Abu Dhabi.
Runs are also expected from Tom Latham, Ross Taylor, Henry Nichols, Colin de Grandhomme and Will Young if he plays. The bowling will be spearheaded by Tim Southee, with support coming from Trent Boult and Matt Henry.
The Basin Reserve wicket could prove pace friendly and the Kiwis are likely to go in with three pacemen and tantalizing spin coming from left arm spinner Ajaz Patel who met with success in the desert.
All said and done, it is hoped that the Lankans will not crumble in heaps, but endeavor to take the Test to the final day of the five day Test. The news that their off spinning ace Akila Dhananjaya has been suspended from international cricket for an illegal action after testing positive in Brisbane would have proved a damper to the Lankan cricketers in New Zealand. But Akilas Achilles Heel could well be healed with some correction. He is talented and his bowling genes will not give up easily.
We hope SLC will invest wisely in getting a special coach to bring our Ace back into the pack of our cards.

CAA officers seek Police protection during raids
The raids conducted by the Consumer Affairs Authority officers has been stalled due to the lack of security provided to them, the Chairman of the National Movement for Consumer Rights Protection Ranjith Withanage. He said this situation has put the consumer in jeopardy.
Withanage said that with the festive season approaching, traders had commenced fleecing the customers.
The President had instructed to ensure adequate supply of essential items during this season. However, due to the threats to the lives of raiding officers of the Consumer Affairs Authority, these officers are reluctant to carry out their raids effectively, which has led to the suspension of raids. The most recent incident is the attack of CAA officers in the Kegalle town.
He said although the National Movement for Consumer Rights Protection had made a request to provide police protection for these raiding officers, so far no action had been taken.
Therefore, Withanage urged the authorities to provide police protection to the CAA raiding officers so that they could carry out their raids and protect the rights of the consumer.

CICT to enhance Colombo Ports  deep water capacity by March 2019
Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) has announced a significant equipment additionthat will enhance the terminals deep water capacity and make Colombo one of the few ports in Asia capable of handling vessels of 22,000 + TEUs.
The Company said the enhancement encompasses the addition of two new mega Quay Gantry Cranes (QGCs), six new Rubber-tyred Gantry Cranes (RTGs) and 12 Prime Movers, and is planned for completion by March 2019.
CICTs existing QGCs are the biggest gantry cranes in the Indian Subcontinent region, and the addition of two even larger twin-lift QGCs from Zhenhua Port Machinery Company (ZPMC), a global leader in quayside container cranes, will further strengthen the Port of Colombos hub status, the Company said.
The new QGCs will provide a lifting height of 54 metres above rail level and 18 metres below rail level with an outreach of 26 across and a lifting capacity of 65 tons, making it possible for the Colombo South container terminal managed by CICT to unload and load 22,000 + TEU vessels, the largest container carriers afloat.
To support the estimated 13 per cent consequent increase in CICTs capacity, the Company has also announced plans to strengthen quayside and yard operations with the acquisition of the six new RTGs also manufactured by ZPMC, which can stack one container over six containers high and one container across six containers width, and to deploy an additional 12 Prime Movers as Terminal Tractors.
This improvement of capacity and upgrade of facilitiesat a time of global economic uncertainty is an emphatic demonstration of our commitment to the Port of Colombo, and reflects how serious we are about continuing to be the major contributor to the ports bid to be a major transhipment hub, CICT CEO Jack Huang said.
CICT has taken the initiative to boost the Ports deep water capacity within just five years of commencement of operations, at a time when other ports in the region are aggressively adding capacity. Demand for deep water facilities is increasing at a rapid pace and requires the quick response that only CICT is able to provide.
Huang added that besides enabling the port to attract larger vessels, this additionwill generate more capacity and berthing space by turning ships around faster.
CICT is already the principal contributor to growth at the Port of Colombo, having achieved one million TEUs and two million TEUs respectively in its first two years of operation and generated a 14 per cent growth for the port after four years of static growth. CICT has also set benchmark productivity levels for the region achieving 36 moves per hour and helping the Port of Colombo move from a rank 28th to 23rdamong the worlds best 30 ports, and from 18thto 13thfor connectivity.

Why we must respect Supreme Court
A supreme court is the highest court within the hierarchy of courts in many legal jurisdictions. Other descriptions for such courts include court of last resort, apex court, and highest (or final) court of appeal. Broadly speaking, the decisions of a supreme court are not subject to further review by any other court. Supreme courts typically function primarily as appellate courts, hearing appeals from decisions of lower trial courts, or from intermediate-level appellate courts.
The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka is the highest court of Sri Lanka. The Supreme Court is the highest and final judicial instance of record and is empowered to exercise its powers, subject to the provisions of the Constitution. The Court has ultimate appellate jurisdiction in constitutional matters, and take precedence over all lower Courts. The land judicial system is complex blend of each unwritten and civil-law. In some cases such as executing, the decision may be passed on to the President of the Republic for clemency petitions.
According to Article 118 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court is the highest and final superior court of record and is empowered to exercise original advisory and appellate judicial functions. It is conjointly the ultimate Court of Record and also the Court of attractiveness of land.
In one of the landmark judgements, the Supreme Court ruled that powers over land would continue to remain vested in the Central Government, and not the provincial councils.
The verdict assumes significance within the wake of the governments apparent reluctance to devolve land and police powers  expressed within the thirteenth change that followed the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987  to its provinces. It practically killed the 13th amendment.
Therefore the citizens of Sri Lanka must abide by the Judgement delivered by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka.

## Title: Colourful, controversial and captivating - SHANE KEITH WARNE
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Friday, December 14, 2018 - 01:00
Colourful, controversial and captivating - SHANE KEITH WARNE
He is a world renowned Hall of Fame. He framed the art of leg spinning/googly bowling in a sensational manner. He was a wizard in the true sense of the word. And he kept the cricket loving fraternity at their wits end by injecting controversy. SHANE KEITH WARNE, dominated the cricketing world with a 'warning'---you will not find another like me in a century of time!
WARNE loved to bathe in controversy. He was always good copy for the news hungry mediamen. This was not only in Australia, but where ever he plied his trade --- a rare trade which was like a magician pulling out a rabbit from his hat---or more precisely his baggy green cap.
Good rapport with media
When WARNE took questions from probing mediamen, he always made news. And big news at that. He would always answer questions very cleverly and with aplomb never losing his cool. He built up a good rapport with the media.
When he first sported the baggy green cap and made his appearance in Sri Lanka under the clever Allan Border, not much was known of him other than being able to bowl leg spin and the usual googly, the stock deliveries of a bowler of his type.
When he in the First Test against Sri Lanka at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground was called upon to bowl, he bowled gentle spin in the first innings causing no undue worries to the local batsmen. He was carted all over the ground as well as over it. He appeared to be just another bowler!
Batting prodigy  sub head
It was a rerun of what the Indians did to him in Australia, bashing him all over the grounds. He was treated harshly especially by Indian batting prodigy and genius Sachin Tendulkar with his youthful exuberance who treated him without scant respect. With disdain, in fact. Warnes figures of 1 for 150 tells the mauling he took.
Going into the final day, with the wicket playing easy and a Sri Lankan victory looking certain, writing a COMMENT in the DAILY NEWS, I headlined that article  A game is not won or lost till the final ball is bowled, extolling on the Lankans not to take it easy, but go hard at the opponents.
But the second innings of that Test with Sri Lanka was unbelievable. The Lankans were galloping to victory. Skipper Border tossed the ball to WARNE as a last resort. In the first innings WARNE had figures of 1 for 78. But Border took a risk. And what WARNE did was to befuddle three Sri Lankan batsmen and grab the last three wickets without conceding a run to give the Aussies a victory by 16 runs. At one stage the Aussies thought the match was surely lost.
History now
But the Lankans dropped their guard and the rest of that Test is history now.
It was this mesmerizing spell that launched his meteoric rise to fame, fortune and controversy and when he finally bade good bye he had left a leg spinning/googly bowling legacy with a cocktail of other deliveries that had the brand name WARNE sealed on it.
However WARNE after bowling Australia to that famous victory, failed to perform in the next Test against West Indies and was dropped for the First Test against the West Indies in the next season. But that did not deter the young bowler. He was picked for the Second Test and he hit back with a vengeance capturing 7 for 52 in the second innings and helped Australia to victory.
Mother German
WARNE was born on September 13, 1969 to German  born Bridgette and Keith Warne and made his debut in big time cricket on January 2, 1992 against India at home on the historic Sydney Cricket Ground.
And that Test against India was one that he would love to hate when the Indian batsmen walloped him slapping figures of 1 for 150 in the first innings. The wicket he had was that of the present Indian coach Ravi Shastri caught by Dean Jones for 206 off 45 overs.
In the Fourth Test at Adelaide he went wicket-less conceding 78 runs and in the Two Tests his figures were 1 for 228 had the mortification of being dropped for the next Test in Perth. His next tour was Sri Lanka and what he did has been chronicled above.
Ball of the century
He made his eagerly awaited Ashes tour to England in 1993. Ashes series against the old foe is something that is looked forward to by any cricketer of both countries. And with the first ball of that series he is on record of having bowled the ball of the century that pitched outside leg stumps, turned prodigiously to knock England captain Mike Gattings off bail. It bewildered the bowler, the batsmen, the commentators and everyone watching the action.
In the 1993/94 Ashes series against England in which he took 27 wickets, he also performed the one and only Test hat trick when he bagged Phil de FreItas, Darren Gough and Devon Malcom in the boxing day Test at the famed Melbourne Cricket Ground.
WARNE then continued his phenomenal success against all opposition and captured bags full of wickets. And man of the match awards kept flooding into his cupboard. He became the third spinner to take 1000 wickets in all forms of the game. The other to perform this rare feat was Muttiah Muralitheran.
Fined by ACB
WARNE along with team Mark Waugh was fined by the ACB for accepting money from a book-maker for supplying information about weather and pitch conditions. He also had the ignominy of having a ban imposed on him before the start of the World Cup and was sent home after a drug test during a one-day series in Australia proved positive for a banned diuretic.
His innocence was not accepted by the Australian Cricket Board which found WARNE guilty of breaching the Boards Drug Code and had a one year ban slapped on him.
WARNE also proved his magic in the limited over games for Australia and in the Indian Premier league leading his team Rajasthan Royals to the plum as captain and coach.
He also captained the Australian one day team and missed by a whisker of leading the country in Test cricket. He had 37 5 wicket hauls and 10 ten wicket hauls.
Space does not permit me to detail all of WARNES unique achievements in a record breaking controversial, yet colorful career. He retired as the best leg spin bowler which the cricket world saw and will not see again with 708 wickets. Off spinner Muralitheran went past him to bag 800 Test wickets.

CR forwards along with their speedy three quarters gave a pathetic performance against Havelock sports club last week where they went down 22-31 to Havies, hence the red shirts will have to come up with a much improved performance if they hope to overcome the Air Men at their own den, Longden Place.
Meanwhile the lads from Ratmalana lost to Police Sports Club 19-28 after a superb performance where their forwards had an out standing game scoring the solitary try in their first round game played at Police Park in Colombo last week and if they play to their full potential then another terrific tussle for supremacy can be expected today. And it wont be a surprise if Air Force sports club pull off a shock win against the red shirts today.

A crisis created by JRJ in 1977
Confused situation with both the Legislature as well as the Executive of the state involved in a political impasse would be resolved according to the President within the next seven days. This assurance by the Head of State has brought some relief to the masses.
Some allege that the crisis was created by President Maithripala Sirisena on October 26, 2018 when he decided to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister, but if one examines the contemporary political history, it reveals what we have highlighted in the beginning, that he only used provisions in an already constructed device set on September 22, 1977 by JRJ. A Bill was adopted by the then National State Assembly on that day as the Second Constitutional Amendment. Executive power was transferred to the President and JR Jayewardene became the first Executive President of Sri Lanka on Independence Day, February 4, 1978.
Statesman Abraham Lincoln in his world famous Gettysburg Address stated , democracy is by the people, for the people and of the people simply validate not only how the power should be used for the rights, welfare and dignity of the people, but in a deadlock, like in the current political mayhem, as the nation continues to be engrossed in a crisis constitutional or otherwise of unprecedented proportion that we have no choice but to seek the Peoples help in sorting out matters as best suites them through a general poll.
But the voter must resolve not to vote for candidates who are corrupt, rowdy, and resort to violence inside the hallowed Chamber, some wielding knives; others using chili powder against opponents as the whole world witnessed a couple of weeks ago. Those involved are not fit to represent the sovereignty of the people. We, the voter must use our ballet to make a difference.
The Court of Appeal issued an interim injunction order restraining Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and his Cabinet from functioning until the hearing of the Writ of Quo Warranto filed against them holding office is concluded. The court fixed dates from December 12 to proceed with the hearing of the petition while notice was also issued on the 49-member Cabinet including Prime Minister Rajapaksa to appear before the court on that date. Accordingly, the court granted leave to proceed with the Quo Warranto petition and issued notice on the respondents to appear before the court and give testimonies.
The court concludes:
An Interim Order is granted against the first respondent functioning as the prime minister...also issuing interim order against the other respondents functioning in their offices.
A similar situation arose in 2004 when President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga asked her party to form a government in April 2004 following parliamentary elections. A hung parliament or a minority government was the outcome, but she seemed assured of a stable government by the Jathika Hela Urumaya who won nine seats.
If the Parliament is not going to be dissolved, the next government formed under a UNF or UPFA led coalition will have to hang on to a third partys whim. Yet the UNP with less than 100 members of their own appears keen to form a government with the help of oppositions TNA and JVP. The UPFA now united with SLPP, too needs a few more coalition partners added on to reach the 113 required to govern with a reasonable degree of comfort. This is not a reality as yet and chances of forming a government are almost non-existent. With their consistent popularity the Rajapaksa led SLPP who even managed to push UNF and SLFP into third place in certain areas at the February Local Government polls are now backing the President to the hilt.
Since there can also be no assurance that SLMC'S seven seats will remain with the UNP, it does leave for a state in which any potential government can be beaten in a no confidence motion by the shifting of the combination and the grouping for the present instability to continue.
What's almost certain now is that both the UNF and UPFA will not be able to form a government. UNF leaders still maintain that they can form a government with the help of 14 or so MPs from the Tamil National Alliance, though the JVP had clearly indicated their unwillingness to support them in forming a government. But this surely is not a representation of reality, and they all know it. The UNF got only 32.4 per cent of the All Island cumulative vote - and the SLPP and UPFA got 44.2 and 13.7 respectively a combined lead that can't easily be defeated at a general election.
UNPs internal strife
There is a deep penetrative strike at the politically delicate UNF. The UNF has an internal division of two groups. One is the privileged pro-Ranil Wickremesinghe faction encircling hardcore men and Royalist friends of him.
The second camp is the more moderate faction backing Sajith Premadasa. This ginger group was not pleased with the leader's conduct of affairs including the running of Party. The group included UNF members who were suspected of plotting a possible crossover to the Rajapaksa government sometime back.
The Speakers biased approach
The constitution clearly says the PM continues to hold office throughout the period during which the Cabinet of ministers continues to function. With the withdrawal of support by Maithri led UPFA, the National status of the government ceased making the jumbo Cabinet illegal.
The Speaker is the uppermost authority in parliament and is anticipated to be absolutely independent and unbiased at all times. Standing orders [A set of rules] is used to manage parliamentary meetings. The Speaker Karu Jayasuriya overlooked the cardinal tenet of impartiality.
The Speaker, though has the power to suspend standing orders if there is an overwhelming support from the MPs present to proceed strictly on urgent matters, did so to please a particular party, to bring in a motion where a five-day notice has to be given: the motion of no confidence was not read and no member knew its contents, let alone have any time for a reasonable debate, and then go for a count of votes quoting a Standing Order that allows him to use Sound.
Speaker was not in control of the House because of his lack of admiration for the rules of parliamenthe didnt even have an agenda for the two meetings on November 15 and 16.
Karu Jayasuriya repeated the same routine on the next day for the second time, despite the Presidents appeal to bring in the motion according to the accepted set procedures and the Standing Orders.
The Judiciary will go down in history as brave man who upheld the rule of law and saved the nation from all types of threats if they return a decision that they genuinely consider is in harmony with the Constitution, rule of law, and democratic norms and sovereignty of the people.
CP de Silva cross-that toppled Sirimavo in 1964
J R Jayewardene was the master manipulator of all the Parliamentary maneuvers that went to topple the government in 1964-- Ceylon Observer: December 20, 1964.
This has a close parallel to present debacle. It happened 54 years ago, on 3rd December 1964, during the Throne Speech vote.
A betrayal by C P de Silva, SLFPs second-in-command, and Minister of Agriculture, Land and Irrigation, and JR Jayewardene and Esmond Wickremesinghe, the uncle and father of Ranil, playing the roles of master manipulator got CP and 15 government MPs, including Mahanama Samaraweera, father of Mangala to change loyalties, and defeat the government by just one vote.
Sirimavo was a Senator throughout her tenure. On hearing the bad news she rushed to the House and met some MPs who were tipped to cross over, and was successful in persuading just two of them to remain. Surely she could have won over a few others but she got involved too late causing her democratically elected government to lose by 74 to 73 votes.

The Crow flies high with Kakiyan
Captain Elmo Jaywardenas latest novel Kakiyan: The story of a Crow launched recently at the M D Gunasena Auditorium, amidst a large gathering of friends and well-wishers.
Kakiyanis Captain Jayawardenas fourth novel following Sams Story, winner of the Gratiaen Prize (2001), The last Kingdom of Sinhalay, which won the State Literary Award (2005), and Rainbows in Braille  shortlisted for the Singapore Literature Prize.
With Kakiyan he brings the most-frowned upon bird, the crow, to the limelight as he paints the world through the eyes of a young crow, growing up with his family and neighboursinthe Jacaranda Condominium. Through a collection of colourful crow characters like Roy Crow - the flying instructor and Victor Crow - the train lover, together with other animal friends such as Croco Martin and Tony Monkey, the book invites the reader to look at themselves in a different perspective. How does the animal world, and in this case, the world of crows  those clever, observant birds that are ever present in our surroundings  see the Great Ones, us humans
Speaking to those gathered, Captain Elmo himself called attention to the animal cruelty that takes place around us, which is sadly internalized to such an extent that it appears to be normal. For him, the animal world was much more compassionate than the human world, where the helpless are looked after. He hoped that Kakiyan would in some way join the ranks of works that speak against animal cruelty. By using the common crow as the protagonist, he is also showing how close to home such issues are.
The first copies were presented to Max Jayamanna and Prof. YasmineGooneratne. Captain Elmo then called upon a special person from the audience, who has been a constant figure in the local literary circles, not by writing his own novels, but by making hundreds of novels available to readers, most who have grown up borrowing books from him  Deen the Bookman.
Kakiyanhas thus made its way to the bookshelves and has become one of the rare books that champions the crow.

Trunk also gets tricked by his ego into thinking there is a fast food joint named after him, MrDonalds, where he can get a Big MAC raincoat; mistakenly thinks jumbo jets were made for elephants when he tries to get a ticket on Sri Lankan Airlines; thinks photo booths should be made bigger if you want both ears in a passport shot; and gets into trouble over his love of bananas. There are also many visual laughs to be had, such as him attempting a selfie with his trunk, the incessant pursuit of the steaming monster crab and Trunks various dreams of glory as a footballer, space traveller or King-bearing elephant.
Janet learns as she sketches out the fascinating visual story line of the book just how important elephants are representing patience, wisdom and memory. It is said they help us find direction; with perfect memory handed down through the generations, the elephant knows its way around, always assessing how to find food and water, even in massive climatic changes, and how to protect the herd from attack by, for instance, walking miles around an area in which they sense poachers are operating. Through their six senses, elephants negotiate with the world they live in, for example, by picking up vibrations in the air, on the ground and by knowing the calls and behaviours of other animals. They, in turn, pass messages on - using their feet they drum on the ground to send signals great distances. Currently, mans lack of understanding of the importance of the natural world, of which we are all a part, has led to the elephant corridors, as they are called, being blocked by manmade structures, which has brought about a detachment from the natural path - this is a metaphor for the modern world we live in and needs to be addressed if we are to return to a more wholesome life. In the story, Donald embraces the bigger mission for him to redeem the fate of his heartlessly slaughtered ancestors in the high country, but is continually sidetracked by the promise of finding paradise on earth, from which he is relentlessly chased away by Crabzilla.
Crabzilla, although a monstrous scary character, was inspired by the BBC Blue Planet series that has connected us with the marine world hitherto beyond our understanding and reach. On his quest to track down Trunk, we are introduced to other cultures from which we can all learn. The crab, one of the 7 monsters in the eight part series, symbolises movements in a different direction to that which we are facing, but also the opportunity for renewal and rebirth through the shedding of their shells as they grow.
These symbols represent an opportunity to get round the shadows in our lives. The crab is also seen as a talisman for protection, found at the bottom of the ocean, which signifies that we should look deep within ourselves to find our spiritual core and a new path.
The crab, with its oversize pincers, demands that we face our fears head on before it is too late and alter our behaviours to think bigger and better.
Using the symbolism in the paintings associated with animals, the Donald Trunk series takes our child into an imaginary world full of cultural knowledge and embraces how different people live their lives and learn ways in which we can reach a better place through humour, understanding and empathy for others as well as celebrating the world in which we live. Janet Anderton in this latest book to be launched on January 16, 2019 at The Jetwing Lighthouse Hotel Galle has brilliantly captured the humour and character of the rakish Crabzilla and Donald Trunk. Janet admitted to me, laughing as she did so, that she sometimes thinks she has become Trunk, as her bed disappears under a pile of elephant drawings for the books. The artist who hails from Bolton, a place that celebrates the importance of the elephant, having incorporated it on the coat of arms has a sister living in Sri Lanka and through her has learnt a great deal about this very special island that Anderton like so many others has totally fallen in love with. She received a B.A. in Fine Art from Loughborough Art College in 1985 and is famous for her paper cuts and collages using unloved books.
She puts every written page to good use and shows the importance of recycling, while impressing on the minds of children, the art and power of books. This allows children to live in the imaginary world and in the case of Donald Sri Lankas swimming elephant also learn about the incredible history of the island, which was as technically advanced as the ancient Greeks and Romans.
So go on join in the fun and book a ticket to a game changing event and learn first hand what really goes on behind the scenes of creating such a creative book at the fairy tale setting of the southern coastlines most beautiful hotel Jetwing Lighthouse.

Exam Genius introduces robot teacher
Exam Genius, a leading institute researching and developing new computer systems using state-of-the-art technologies, introduces an innovative artificial teacher with inbuilt time machine that develops childrens intelligence while training them properly.
The artificial teacher has been introduced to the market through Greentel Tabs. Many academics are of the opinion that the advent of an artificial teacher with a time machine will revolutionize the modern education in Sri Lanka. It scientifically analyses pre-data as to how the child answered the questions using artificial intelligence and identifies the childs skills, weaknesses and doubtful areas which needs special attention on each subject. Then the robot teacher goes on to decide on ideal question papers that should be given to the child based on its analysis. It is only a computerized system can efficiently and effectively analyze and come to conclusions on complicated matters.
The time machine trains the child to work within a time frame and manage the time effectively to answer the questions. A salient feature of the time machine is its ability to show the results and grades immediately after calculating the childs scores and revising the question paper with correct answers and the way to get them.
Since it inspires and makes an interest in the child to engage in education children tend to answer question papers without parental influence. The Greentel tab has been specially designed for kids blocking internet access.

Fighting Global climate change
The threat of global climate change had led to both national and international investigations into its effects as well as attempts by the international system to mitigate its causes or adapt to its potential effects. Countries in isolation would not be able to substantially influence or adopt optimal policies to cope with global climate change. An international regime is sought to overcome this problem.
International regime
International regimes are social institutions that consist of agreed-upon principles, norms, rules, decision-making procedures and programmes that govern the interaction of actors in specific issue areas (Bulkey and Newell, 2010). Climate change was addressed for the first time in the international arena by the United Nations General Assembly in 1979 by adopting Resolution 43/53 on Protection of global climate for present and future generations of mankind.
The current centerpiece for action against global climate change is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 1992. The ultimate objective of this convention is to achieve stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system (Article 2). The Conference of the Parties to the Convention (COP) became the conventions ultimate authority, holding its first session - COP 1 in Berlin in 1995.
Kyoto Protocol
The Kyoto Protocol was adopted under the UNFCCC at the Conference of Parties in Kyoto in 1997 and entered into force in 2005. This protocol commits its parties by setting internationally binding emission reduction targets. Recognising that developed countries are principally responsible for the current high levels of GHG emissions in the atmosphere as a result of more than 150 years of industrial activities, the protocol places heavier burden on developed nations under the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.
Paris Agreement
At COP 21 in Paris in 2015, parties to the UNFCCC reached a landmark agreement known as the Paris Agreement. It requires all parties to put forward their best efforts through nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead. The main objective of the Paris Agreement is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.
IPCC
IPCC is the UN body for assessing the science related to climate change. It was created to provide policymakers with regular scientific assessments on climate change, its implications and potential future risks, as well as to put forward adaptation and mitigation options. The main activity of the IPCC is the preparation of reports assessing the state of knowledge of climate change. When IPCC members met at Incheon, South Korea, in October 2018, a landmark report from the panel pointed a far more disturbing picture of the immediate consequences of climate change than previously thought and said that avoiding the damage requires transforming the world economy at a speed and scale that has no documented precedent.
G20 Summit
Climate change was one of the most important subjects tackled at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in November 2018. All the G20 members except USA agreed to implement the irreversible Paris Agreement on climate change. US President Donald Trump reiterated his decision to withdraw US from the Paris Agreement, which they officially cannot do until 2020. Thus, USA is the only country that refused to sign the joint statement on climate change at the G20 summit. Indias Prime Minister having a discussion at the summit with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres about climate change and Indias support for the Paris Agreement, said the motivation for his strong commitment to climate action is rooted in the ancient Hindu scriptures, the Vedas.
COP 24
The 24th Conference of the Parties to the UN Climate Change Convention (COP24) commenced on December 3 at Katowice, Poland. One of its main tasks is to adopt decisions ensuring the implementation of the Paris Agreement to fight climate change. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, addressing the conference said that climate change is running faster than we are and we must catch up sooner rather than later, before it is too late. For many people, regions and even countries, this is already a matter of life and death. He further highlighted that climate action offers a compelling path to transform our world for the better. Governments and investors need to be on the green economy, not the grey.
According to the UN, the UNFCCC presented a new report that highlights both progress and gaps as developed countries implement climate actions to meet their targets in the period before 2020. The World Bank has announced $200 bn in funding over five years to support countries taking actions against climate action. The World Health Organizations special report at the conference provided recommendations for governments on how to maximise the health benefits of tackling climate change.
Copenhagen Summit
The Copenhagen Summit was held in Denmark in October 2018 with the participation of heads of state and governments together with leaders of international organisations, business, academic institutions and civil society to form a powerful global coalition for sustainable growth through innovative partnerships. It is a global initiative with the ambition of becoming the worlds leading forum for developing concrete publicprivate partnerships at scale to deliver on sustainable development goals and the Paris Agreement.
Apart from the above major institutions, multilateral and regional development banks also play a key role in financing climate change mitigation and adaptation.
The World Bank is a key actor which has been involved in a range of climate change initiatives. At Manila, Philippines, in September 2018, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) raised $750 million to help finance climate change mitigation and adaptation projects with an issue of 10-year green bonds. Proceeds of the green bond will support low carbon and climate-resilient projects funded through the ADBs ordinary capital resources and used in its non-concessional operations.

The EU and scores of developing countries have pledged to toughen their existing commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to enable the world to stay within a 1.5C rise in global warming.
The promise, which follows increasingly dire scientific warnings, was the most positive message yet to come from the ongoing talks in Poland.
The announcement came at the end of a day in which the UN secretary general made an impassioned intervention to rescue the talks, which have been distracted by US, Russian and Saudi moves to downgrade scientific advice.
Were running out of time, Antnio Guterres told the plenary. To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal.
The talks have centred on devising a rulebook for implementing the 2015 Paris agreement and raising countries level of ambition to counter climate change, but progress has been slow on several key issues and divisions have emerged between four fossil fuel powers  the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait  and the rest of the world.
The UN believes China could play a stronger role in the absence of leadership from the US. Sources said Guterres would make a telephone call to Xi to ask for his help in nudging talks forward.
The EU also wants China, which is a key member of the block of 77 developing countries, to step up to ensure that countries all follow the same rules in being transparent over their greenhouse gas emissions.
Campaigners praised the decision by the High Ambition Coalition group of countries, made up of the EU and four other developed countries, including Canada and New Zealand, as well as the large grouping of least developed countries and several other developing nations, to scale up their emissions-cutting efforts in line with a 1.5C temperature rise limit.
Wendel Trio, director of the Climate Action Network Europe, said: The spirit of Paris is back. The statement will boost greater ambition at the crunch time of these so far underwhelming talks. For the EU this must mean a commitment to significantly increase its 2030 target by 2020, even beyond the 55 percent reduction some member states and the European parliament are calling for. We call upon the countries that have not signed the statement so far to stop ignoring the science.
Guterres, in a pointed criticism aimed at the four countries that have been refusing to welcome the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes special report on 1.5-degree warming, said rejecting climate science was indefensible.
He added: The IPCC special report is a stark acknowledgment of what the consequences of global warming beyond 1.5 degrees will mean for billions of people around the world, especially those who call small island states home. This is not good news, but we cannot afford to ignore it.
Frank Bainimarama, the prime minister of Fiji and the outgoing chair of COP23, amplified Guterres message. He told delegates they risked going down in history as the generation that blew it  that sacrificed the health of our world and ultimately betrayed humanity because we didnt have the courage and foresight to go beyond our short-term individual concerns: craven, irresponsible and selfish.
The former US vice-president Al Gore told delegates they faced the single most important moral choice in history of humanity.
Behind the scenes, delegates said there had been strong progress on finance thanks to a doubling of commitments by Germany and Norway to help poorer nations adapt to climate change and build institutions capable of monitoring emissions. Nicholas Stern, the author of a landmark review on the economics of climate change, praised the level of ideas and cooperation.
But others said there were still many disputed brackets in the negotiating text on transparency and other elements of the rulebook.
There has been some progress, but its a very worrying time. There is still a lot more on the table than we hoped for at this stage, said Helen Mountford, vice-president of the World Resources Institute. The secretary general is coming in to make sure this COP can land in a good place. He will hold a summit next year to raise ambitions. If he wants success there, then here we need a robust rulebook and clear signals on ambition and finance.
Janos Pasztor, the former climate adviser to Ban Ki-moon, told The Guardian that Guterres was doing the right thing by intervening at a crucial stage. He needs to make clear what the IPCC has described as a major challenge, and that we have to deliver on that, he said.
Pasztor added: We are talking about the need for massive emissions reductions that have to happen now, not in the future. It is very daunting. The secretary general has reminded the world of what is at stake, and the political significance of that.
The contrasts with the Paris climate summit, in terms of the political atmosphere, were striking. David Leva, who was part of the French government team that helped to broker the successful 2015 conference, said the geopolitical winds were far less favourable today. Globally, the rise of nationalists such as Donald Trump in the US and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil has tilted power towards fossil fuel and agribusiness interests.
He said: In the year before Paris, all countries made clear that they wanted an agreement. Now, there are repeated attacks on multilateralism, and this has empowered groups that take negative actions.
Leva, who is at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations, expressed hope that the secretary general might make a difference. The fact that he has come back shows he feels a need to whip countries into order, he said.
There has been some criticism of the pro-coal government of Poland for failing to press governments to raise their ambitions. But it joined Fiji as co-chair of the Talanoa phase of the negotiations to issue a call for action that recognised the importance of the 1.5C report as the basis for more urgency and ambition.
The window for action is closing fast. We need to do more and we need to do it now, said the document, which would form part of the official statement from this conference.

IIHS graduates another batch of  SMART Health Professionals
A pioneering Sri Lankan education institute with 16 years in the field, the International Institute of Health Science (IIHS) recently saw a number of students graduate with diplomas and degrees in Nursing, Physiotherapy, Bio Medical Sciences and Health Administration.
With a focus for its young and mature learners going beyond academia only, giving them the confidence and aptitude to become all-round achievers, IIHS continues to soar in the Sri Lankan, and even South Asian, education sector as it stands out as one of the very few private institutes to offer unique international pathways to globally-recognized universities as well as helping fast track careers in healthcare. IIHS is also especially honored to be the home of hard working, ambitious, critical thinking and determined students who continue to take large strides within the academic world.
Many academic and non-academic milestones have been achieved for the year 2018. In order to align with the vision of the Founders of IIHS, we have opened doors in education island-wide with our centers in Badulla, Kandy, Galle and Anuaradhapura. We believe in providing accessible, affordable education for all and we hope to be the regional hub for education by the year 2020, said Dr. Kithsiri Edirisinghe, Co-Founder, CEO and Director of Academics at IIHS, speaking at the graduation ceremony.
Dr. Edirisinghe also added, IIHS has had a successful year in terms of partnerships, and our latest programs encompass the University of Aberdeen, Coventry University, Deakin University, Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences and Open University Malaysia. In the next few years, IIHS will export its program regionally and we would be the first in the industry to do so.
Dr. Nihal De Silva, Dean and Chairman of IIHS, said, It is my privilege to be at yet another excellent IIHS Graduation event. IIHS has produced over 700 graduates over the course of the last 15 years. Our graduates have excelled professionally and our alumni are a great testimonial to our achievements.

The IIHS graduation ceremony always showcases the finest young health care professionals in the fields of Nursing, Physiotherapy, Bio Medical Science and Health Management. I am proud to say that the quality of education delivered by IIHS is of higher quality and is no match for the competitive health care education institutes in Sri Lanka. IIHS has uplifted the reputation and professional status for Nurses in Sri Lanka; it is indeed a leader in producing wholesome professionals locally and internationally.

Kohli undaunted by Ashwin, Sharma injury blows
PERTH - India skipper Virat Kohli was undaunted Thursday despite losing prolific spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and batsman Rohit Sharma to injury as he looks to twist the knife in the second Test against Australia.
The visitors went 1-0 in the four-Test series after a tense, 31-run win in Adelaide earlier this week -- their first victory in Australia in a decade.
But India, who are searching for their first series win in Australia, suffered a setback when Ashwin and the experienced Sharma were declared unavailable for the second Test in Perth, starting Friday.
Ashwin is receiving treatment for a left-sided abdominal strain, while Sharma jarred his back while fielding in Adelaide, the Board of Control for Cricket in India said.
Also missing, as expected, will be exciting young opener Prithvi Shaw, who suffering ligament damage in a warm-up match ahead of the Adelaide Test. The BCCI said Shaw, 19, was recovering well but was still undergoing treatment.
However, Kohli was bullish about Indias prospects in the inaugural Test at the new Perth Stadium, which has replaced the citys venerable WACA Ground as its premier cricket venue.
We are definitely confident of the percentage of chances we have and we want to build on that, said Kohli at a pre-match press conference before the injury problems were announced.
Obviously Australia is going to be a strong team in their home conditions and on a wicket like Perth, which probably offers you more than most other pitches in Australia. But we have an equal chance. Ashwin took six wickets in the first Test, while Sharma hit scores of 37 and one. They were the notable absences in Indias initial 13-man squad.
All-rounder Hanuma Vihari is expected to slot in for Sharma, with the final spot a toss-up between pacemen Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Umesh Yadav or Ravindra Jadeja, who has taken 185 Test wickets with his left-arm spin and also averages 32.44 with the bat.
More excited than nervous
The Test will be the first at the new 60,000-capacity Perth Stadium, whose wicket is likely to be fast and bouncy like the old WACA, just over the Swan River.
Kohli said he was impressed by the new arena and not concerned by a wicket that is set to favour fast bowlers, with Australia having a world-class line-up of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins.
He pointed to his own attack of Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, saying they were at the peak of their abilities.
We certainly get more excited than nervous looking at lively pitches now because we understand that we do have a bowling attack that can bowl the opposition out as much as they are confident about their attack, he said.
When you have fast bowlers who are at the peak of their abilities it is always a great thing to have in the side.
And as batsmen it gives us a lot of motivation and boosts us up to put in those significant match-winning batting performances, because we have so much belief in our bowling unit at the moment.
We understand that if we bat well, we will definitely get the result that we want. Despite Kohlis confidence, he cautioned his team not becomplacent, noting that we need to keep repeating good things to win series. - AFP

Lankan company designs worlds largest underwater restaurant
AKDA Engineering Group Sri Lanka which designed the worlds first underwater night club, spa and wine cellar has also completed building the worlds largest underwater restaurant with a glass tunnel.
Eng. A K Diyabalanage, Chairman, Managing Director AKDA said that all these innovation were not copies but original engineering marvels from Sri Lanka. He said that it took Colombo Dockyard five months to build this restaurant which is 22.5 meters long and weighs about 220 tons. The total investment is around US$ 1.5 million.
The state of the art under water restaurants could accommodate nearly 30 people and would be delivered to Uthuru Maafara Luxury Hotel island owned by Akbar Brothers in the Maldives next Monday, by sea. The underwater restaurant would have two lifts to carry guest and will also offer 180 degrees of underwater sea view. It would be placed six meters below sea level.
Diyabalanage said that this is the fifth underwater leisure sector project they have completed and delivered to the Maldives hotels. We are now looking at accepting bigger orders from all over the world including buyers from Europe to help Sri Lanka to get more foreign exchange.
We started this enterprise in 1985 as a local construction company specializing as an offshore contractor and a craft builder. Over the years weve diversified into many and varied disciplines because of our manifold forte in agriculture; plantation and realty; designers, consultants and contractors.
AKDA Group comprises of AKDA Engineering Lanka (Private) Limited specializing in steel buildings, tank farms, water purification plants and products manufacturing equipment: AKDA Engineers International (Private) Limited was established for the designing and construction of roads, airports, harbours, shipyards, craft building, on shore and off shore hotels. We have also built the futuristic Air Traffic Control Tower in Male International Airport, Republic of Maldives largest Harbour, Dharavandhoo Domestic Airport in Maldives. In addition we have so far constructed 36 harbours and 8 airports and this is our 6th underwater facility project. These projects have helped Sri Lanka to earn over US$1 billion so far.
He said that he played a major role in the development of Trincomalee harbor and the Navy facility. Unfortunately no major developments are happening now and the Trincomalee tourism, maritime potential is underutilized.
Diyabalanage said that they also developed a new typology of architecture known as aquatecture meant to provide either leisurely temporary accommodation or permanent residence when time on land is no longer an option.

Maize imports slashed by 50 percent
The Agriculture Ministry has decided to reduce maize imports by 50 percent from next year since the country has been able to produce more than 50 percent of its maize requirement.
According to Ministry statistics, Sri Lanka had imported 164,000 metric tons of maize in 2017 at a cost of Rs. 23,000 million and around 80,000 metric tons of maize has already been imported so far this year.
In 2017, there were only 150,000 acres of maize cultivated in the country and the Ministry has increased this to 250,000 acres this Maha season.
With this total extent of maize cultivated land, the Ministry hopes to produce more than 50 percent of the countrys maize requirement.
Though the maize importers requested to issue maize importation licenses to import 300,000 metric tons of maize this year, the ministry did not issue licenses in order to safeguard local farmers.
It is also reported that over 2,000 acres of maize cultivated lands in the country were completely destroyed by the Sena caterpillar. But, this would not affect the total estimated harvest of the country.
The National Food Promotion Board forecasts an increase in the maize harvest this Maha season due to the favourable weather conditions prevailing in the country.

UNP Parliamentarian S.M.Marikkar said that he lodged a complaint with Police headquarters yesterday against the fraudulent document which has been circulating and is said to have been signed between the United National Party (UNP) and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). A copy of such a fraudulent document is now circulating in social media.
He said that it is entirely a fraudulent document since no agreement has been signed between the UNP and the TNA. Following the vote of Confidence, passed in the parliament to prove UNP leader Ranil Wickremasinghe commands the confidence of Parliament to function as Prime Minister, he said that certain SLFP and Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna members are leveling allegations that the TNA voted in favour of the UNP as there is an agreement between the two parties, he said.
According to Marikkar the TNA voted in favour of the UNP unconditionally.
However certain politicians are leveling baseless allegations that the TNA is supporting the UNP in accordance with an agreement signed between the UNP and the TNA. A draft of a fraudulent agreement is circulating in the social media now. Therefore I lodged a complaint with the police seeking an investigation into it he added.
He further said that it has been decided to take tough action against those responsible persons, who are behind this fraudulent document once the UNP comes to power.
Once we come to power, we will implement the law of the country properly against those persons,unlike the last time he said.
Parliamentarian Harshana Rajakaruna addressing the media said that it is the duty of the President to act in accordance with the constitution and appoint Ranil Wickremasinghe the Prime Minister again.
The majority of the UNP in Parliament has been proved many times . Therefore President should listen to the voice of the majority he said. He urged Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa to resign from the Prime Minister post respecting the constitution as he hasnt the majority in Parliament.
He added that a constitution cannot be framed secretly. It should be passed in Parliament and it should be passed by a referendum. Therefore,it is a big lie that the UNP is trying to offer federalism through implementing a new constitution.
There is no way to implement a new constitution secretly since it should be passed in Parliament and at a referendum. Therefore it is a baseless allegation that the UNP is ready to grant federal status through a new constitution he said.

The hyper active Modi made Bharathiya Janata Party, which was somewhat limited to the Northern Hindi belt of North, Central and Western India into a national political movement and made inroads even to South India, Eastern India and North Eastern region in a short span of three years and the political analysts made predictions that Modi would win again in 2019 to rule India for five more years. They also believed that Congress President Rahul Gandhi was no match for fast tracking Modi.
The predictions seem to go haywire as the Congress Party emerged victorious in recent state assembly elections. When the results announced, supporters have gathered at the Congress headquarters in New Delhi to cheer their young leader.
For Rahul Gandhi, the last weeks results of state elections mark the biggest victory of his political career. Apart from the outcome itself, the partys performance increases the chances of an alliance coming together to take on the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections even as it strengthens the Congress claim to lead this grouping.
The BJP was in power and in serious contention in three states of the five that went to the polls and lost all of them. The Congress managed to win to grab power on its own or in an alliance, in all the states that went to polls, including the key Hindi heartland states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.
This was an unexpected blow to BJP, as over the past five years, it has emerged the most powerful political force India has ever seen. Prime Minister Modi also made sure that his BJP perfected the art of the campaign across several dimensions such as caste, choice of candidates, use of social media and public relations.
Strong momentum
For the young Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, to snatch power from such a party, in not one, but three states, is something that would make even experienced political campaigners very proud. A victory in these elections will give Rahul Gandhi's party a strong momentum ahead of the General Elections in 2019.
There is not much the Narendra Modi government can do to win back the voters who abandoned the BJP for Congress before the 2019 elections.
Indias first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru made sure the continuity of Congress Government during the first two decades and his daughter Indira Gandhi, who took the baton on and ran ahead until the 1977 debacle. Her decision to impose national emergency and detain opposition leaders and postpone elections boomeranged and the congress was defeated and she lost her own constituency too.
However, it took only three years for Indira Gandhi to bring Congress Party back to power by defeating the opposition which was in utter disarray during their three year rule until 1980.
The Congress lost again in 1989 and V P Singh formed Janta Dal government. But two years later P V Narasimha Rao formed a Congress government.
From 1996 to 2004 the Congress was forced to sit in the opposition when four Prime Ministers, Atal Behari Vajpayee, Deve Gowda, I K Gujral and again Atal Behari Vajpayee ruled India under Janta Dal and BJP headed governments. Congress Party bounced back under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi in 2004, but Sonia refrained from leading the government and appointed trusted colleague Dr. Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister.
BJP defeat
Congress defeat in 2009 marked the onset of strong BJP government headed by Narendra Modi. His hyper activity gave the BJP government and the BJP a solid foundation by the middle of the 5-year term and the political analysts predicted that Modi will win for the second time in 2019.
That dream shattered last week with the news of BJP defeat at the three State Assembly Elections. The main reasons for BJPs electoral debacle include failure of the monetary policies that aimed at strengthening agriculture sector, demonetization of high-value rupee notes and the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). These steps have disrupted the informal sector including agriculture. The economists pointed out that the government expected a fiscal windfall from demonetization, which could have allowed it to significantly increase welfare expenditure or investments. But, this did not happen. The benefits of GST were anyway expected to accrue in the long-term. Its costs however have manifested themselves in the short run.
These failures also derailed Modis most ambitious plan to generate 20 million jobs per year.
The crisis over finance policies resulted in resignation of the Governor of Reserve Bank last week. He blamed the government of attempts to interfere in banking matters. Such an attempt is bound to spook financial investors both in India and abroad. This could trigger a potential crisis in the currency and capital markets. Any such development will damage the pro-reform credentials of the Modi government.
Although the 7%-plus growth rate of the GDP has prevented a massive anger against the BJP in urban India, but the government is unlikely to push a convincing economic narrative as part of its re-election pitch in 2019 even in urban India.
Lok Sabha elections
If a comparison is made between the 2013 and 2018 verdicts, one can clearly infer that though the BJP has lost this time, its performance is not as poor as that of the Congress in 2013. There is not much difference between the two parties as far as the vote share is concerned. The 2018 election has thus been a close contest. Although the Congress has won the elections, the party will have to look ahead at the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections.
Although the elections in our region have shown that when two major elections are held at close intervals, the result of the first one bound to impact the outcome of the other. However, the close contest in some states has shown that the Congress cannot take this for granted. Learning from the state assembly elections, the Congress Party and its President Rahul Gandhi must make necessary amends in its strategies and programmes. He will only have to look back at successes and failures of great grandfather Nehru, grandmother Indira, father Rajiv and last but not the least, mother Sonia who proved her mettle time and again.

Mps, lawyers Comment on the SC ruling
The Supreme Court yesterday delivered the much awaited judgement on the dissolution of Parliament declaring that the President cannot dissolve Parliament before four and a half years from its first sitting unless with a two thirds majority in Parliament.
After delivering the judgment, the politicians and the law professionals who were at the Supreme Court premises expressed their views to the media.
UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa said they express their heartfelt gratitude for the impartial and independent court for upholding justice.
He said it was a great victory for the citizens who respect and cherish justice and democracy.
He also requested his supporters and those who respect democracy to enjoy this victory without hindering or harassing others as it is not decent politics in a democratic society.
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said Parliament should pass the legal provisions to punish those who responsible for the October 26 coup.
According to him, it would be the next step in the process towards passing the 20th Amendment to the Constitution for abolishing the Executive Presidency and then going for a General Election to see a fresh-mandated Parliament.
President Maithripala Sirisena and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa who were responsible for the October 26 coup played this game with nothing other than our country, the JVP Leader said.
The President, with this Supreme Court judgement has to act constitutionally without dragging the country towards anarchy.
This is the worst attack against the countrys Constitution. The coup was implemented to form an illegal government through an illegal power. It was not for the people or the country, he said.
MP Dinesh Gunewardene commenting on the Supreme Court decision said there were several other cases pending in courts on the recent political issue and one has to wait for their outcome as well.
The MP said whatever the decision of the Courts, it was the people who should have the final say with regards to choosing their future political representatives.
Gunewardene went on to say that the court decision does not mean people have rejected polls and added the people will decide who will govern the country at a future election.
MP Namal Rajapaksa said the United National Party is the only political party which does not want to have an election.
However, today the Supreme Court has declared a verdict. Although we are not in agreement with this verdict, this the highest court that we can go to.
If the countrys apex court believes that it should not go beyond the peoples sovereignty, we have to carry forward our struggle with the people, Rajapaksa said.
When asked about the next action to be taken by them, he said that they would go ahead as a team under a broad alliance.
All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) Leader MP Rishad Bathiudeen said this victory is not just a victory against unconstitutional dissolution but a triumph for Parliamentary democracy itself.
He added: This is not just a victory against the dissolution of Parliament, but a triumph for Parliamentary democracy itself and a boost for the 19th Amendment itself. We congratulate all other parties of the UNF, the media and all others activists, for their commitments towards this victory.
TNA Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran said the President now should act according to the decision announced by the courts.
Attorney-at-Law Premanath C. Dolawatte who was an intervener of this case representing the respondent party said that they must respect the judgement delivered by the Supreme Court and they accept the verdict.
Postponing the election without going to the people is a temporary victory, he said.
We intervened in this case to uphold the peoples sovereignty. Therefore, we would not hesitate to appear on behalf of the people at any time, he said.

Office train derails
Passengers along the Main Line were inconvenienced yesterday morning when a Colombo-bound office train from Mirigama detached and derailed near the Maradana railway station, where many crossing points are located.
The accident took place around 8 am and it disrupted the other trains to and from Maradana too. Passengers had to walk towards Maradana railway station from Dematagoda. The engine of the power-set train had detached from the compartments and derailed, damaging the sleepers. No passenger was injured, it was reported.
Passengers who were inconvenienced by the incident claimed that they face difficulties in reaching their workplaces on time due to these kinds of accidents.
The aged, children, women and pregnant mothers were inconvenienced as they had to walk from one station to another, they said.
Passengers requested the railway authorities to look into these matters and rectify shortcomings to prevent such incidents in the future.
However, the Chief Train Controller responded to the claim saying that delays can occur when a line is blocked, especially at a place where a number of crossing points are located.
This is not something done purposely, but we do at our best to run trains on time, he said. A number of compartment detachments, especially involving office trains, were reported on the Main Line and the Kelani Valley Line recently. The Colombo-bound Yaldevi express train from Jaffna also detached last week, while it was running at a considerable speed between Irattai Periyakulam and Vavuniya.

The Opposition Leader conundrum
As rightly being argued by the SLFP/UPFA/SLPP combine TNA leader R. Sampanthan could no longer claim to hold the post of Opposition Leader in the wake of the support extended by the TNA to former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at Wednesdays Confidence Vote moved on behalf of the latter. The entire TNA membership, barring Shivashakthi Anandan (who abstained), voted for Wickremesinghe, backing a UNP sponsored motion expressing Confidence in Wickremesinghe.
The Opposition Leaders post had been a bone of contention with the Joint Opposition (JO) from the very outset of the formation of the new Parliament. It was the JOs contention that it was their faction with a membership of some 50 MPs that represented the largest Opposition group in Parliament and that the TNA which had only 16 Members had no claim to the post. The JO also argued that the TNA was purely a regional party which only represented the Tamil community and espoused Federalism. It could no way be representative of the national electorate as a whole. There are also accusations that the party was working to the agenda of sections of the Tamil Diaspora sympathetic to the separatist cause and therefore was a threat to national security.
But Speaker Karu Jayasuriya would have none of it. It was the Speakers contention that although the UPFA and the UNF contested each other at the August 2015 General Election both parties had now teamed up to form the Unity Government and by virtue of the JO too being part of the UPFA it was not entitled to the Office of Opposition Leader even though it has decided to sit separately in Parliament. The issue cropped up umpteen times in Parliament, with the Speaker sticking to his original ruling and the JO accusing him of working to the dictates of the UNP. In fairness to the Speaker, the SLFP/UPFA did not find fault with his ruling at the time. They remained non committal during the entire debate, lending tacit approval to the Speakers ruling.
However things turned topsy turvy since October 26, with the SLFP/UPFA pulling out of the Unity Government changing the whole equation in Parliament. UPFA MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said that with this change, the Speaker no longer had the authority to recognize the TNA as the official Opposition in Parliament.
To whom should the post belong then Both sides are claiming that they are the Governing Party while the Speaker too is acting coy. While stating that he no longer considers Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister (following No Confidence Motions) he is equally non-committal about the UNP. Even after the Confidence Vote was passed in favour of Wickremesinghe the Speaker did not address him as the Prime Minister. In the light of these developments, many wonder whether we have come to a stage where there is neither a Government nor an Opposition in this country.
Hopefully, the multiple Supreme Court verdicts that are pending would resolve the matter one way or the other. The country is almost teetering on the brink and the situation is becoming grave with each passing day. The UNP has given the Government an ultimatum to settle the crisis within two days failing which they would bring the people to the streets. On the other hand, Government politicians say the status quo would prevail irrespective of the SC ruling on the dissolution.
Meanwhile, the Organization of Professional Association (OPA) has appealed to the warring parties to bury the hatchet and spare a thought for the people. Issuing a statement it has prevailed on all political parties and politicians, legislators and the Executive the need to uphold the spirit of democracy.
The statement said; the OPA views with deep concern, the ongoing political impasse between the Legislature and the Executive. Being a professional apex apolitical body, the OPA urges all parties to the current crisis to resolve their differences through consensus without resorting to violence. The OPA views with deep concern, the effects this impasse has on the economy and urge that the socioeconomic fabric of society is not irreparably damaged. Last week the various Business Chambers too expressed their growing concern on the damage the present crisis would do to the countrys economy and investor confidence.
Rather than issuing statements it would be better for all these professional bodies and Captains of Industry to initiate face to face discussions with the leading actors in the current drama. This way we feel they would be able to drive home their point more effectively eliciting a positive response. As we have mentioned in these spaces religious leaders should take the lead in dousing the flames of hatred and bitter rancour that is evident all round. It is a pity that the Most Ven. Mahanayake Theras are still being lukewarm in their response to the crisis. This is given the prominent role played by the Maha Sangha from the times of our kings to offer their counsel to rescue the nation in times of peril. This nation is presently facing a crisis that demands their pragmatic advice.

Pannipitya Private Hospital to provide  Suraksha benefits to schoolchildren
Pannipitya Private Hospital has made arrangements to provide treatment sans cash payments to all schoolchildren who own Suraksha Insurance cards.
Schoolchildren islandwide with Suraksha medical insurance could obtain treatment from private hospitals by settling the hospital bill paying cash and then getting the amount reimbursed from Sri Lanka Insurance. However the Education Ministry has made special arrangements with seven prominent private hospitals to provide treatment without having to settle the bill by paying cash immediately after treatment.
Considering the high quality service and reasonable-low prices of Pannipitya Private Hospital, the Education Ministry has decided to grant this special status to Pannipitya Private Hospital too.
The Suraksha Insurance Scheme introduced recently by the Education Ministry is provided to all children in government, private and international schools and student Bhikshus carrying out their studies in Pirivenas. The Suraksha Insurance Scheme provides an annual hospitalization medical cover of Rs 200,000 per student.
The normal method of obtaining medical insurance benefits is by the patient initially making the payment to the hospital and them submitting the bills to the insurance company for reimbursement. However with arrangements now made with the insurance company to pay medical claims directly at Pannipitiya Private Hospital for Suraksha Insurance students, Schoolchildren will get the opportunity to settle their medical claims without paying cash.
Our hospital that cuts off unwanted expenditure and passes that benefit also to the patients, with mush pleasure takes this opportunity to grant all benefits that comes under the Suraksha Insurance to our schoolchildren. We are also delighted that Pannipitiya Private Hospital had been granted the facility where children with Suraksha could settle their claims sans cash payments. We see this as a huge benefit for parents who admit their children for treatment to Pannipitiya Private Hospital, said Chairman and Managing Director Ananda Kuruppuarachchi.

The Attorney General, Prof. G.L.

He argued that the President has power to dissolve Parliament in terms of Article 70(1) of the Constitution after completion of four and a half years of Parliament or a resolution to the parliament by 2/3 majority of Parliamentarians.
The attorneys who appeared on behalf of the petitioners yesterday concluded their oral submissions and Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya will make his oral submissions today.
On December 5, Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya raised preliminary objections regarding ten Fundamental Rights petitions filed challenging dissolution of parliament by President. He informed that Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to hear the impugn conduct of the President (dissolution of Parliament) through a Fundamental Rights jurisdiction under Article 126 of the Constitution.
Making his oral submissions, the Attorney General stated that the Presidents duties as the head of the executive, head of the State and head of the Government cannot be challenged through Fundamental Rights jurisdiction under Article 126 of the constitution.
On December 6, Supreme Court further extended till December 10, the Interim Order staying the operation of the Gazette notification issued by the President to dissolve Parliament.
On December 7, the Supreme Court reserved judgment in the Fundamental Rights petitions filed by several political parties and individuals challenging the Gazette notification issued by the President to dissolve Parliament.

Supreme Court also further extended the Interim Order restraining the Election Commission from proceeding to take any steps to conduct the Parliamentary Election by virtue of the proclamation until the judgment date.

RS 19 BN CHALMERS GRANARY  DEVELOPMENT TO KICK OFF IN JUNE 2019
The ambitious Rs 19 billion Chalmers Granary Project will kick off in June 2019.
There are four consortia of investors, comprising two Singaporeans, a Korean and a Britisher who have expressed interest in the project and they have asked for an extension of time to submit their bids till end January due to the prevailing political impasse but the project is definitely on, Urban Development Authority Director General Sumedha Ratnayake told Daily News Business yesterday. He said that all four consortia of investors have been told to submit their bids and they have the options of either going in for apartment complexes, office complexes or an assortment of hotels, the UDA DG said. Asked why no local consortium was in the fray, Ratnayake explained that the magnitude of the investment was perceived to be excessive for the average local conglomerate.
Ratnayake said that the already submitted bids had been submitted to the Cabinet Appointed Tender Board(CATB) and it was the CATB which provided the extension of time to the four bidders till January 2019 due to the prevailing political backdrop. The evaluations will be done and the winning bidder will be able to kick start the project(s) by June 2019, he explained.
He said that the investors will have the discretion of comingout withtheir proposals so long as they complied and conformed to the planning regulations. They have to come out with a 50% Bond Coverage, he said.
He explained that the investors would be given the option of a multitude of alternatives. One would be to purchase the land outright at the Government Valuers valuation which was Rs. 19 billion and proceed with the project(s) of their choice. The second would be to come into a joint venture with the UDA in the form of a joint stock company where the investors own a parcel of the shares. The third option would be for the investor to construct complexes to match the Rs. 19 Billion value of the land.
The project proposals will be evaluated by the Technical Evaluation Committee and marks will be given for the proposals, he said.

An indoor skydiving enthusiast in Australia set a Guinness World Record by doing splits and spinning for a full minute.
Doni Gales, 23, was named the record holder for most front split spins in a wind tunnel in one minute after she completed 55 rotations in 60 seconds at iFLY Down Under in Penrith, New South Wales.
Gales, who has been working as an iFly instructor for the past nine months, nearly doubled the number of spins required by Guinness to create the new record.
Our Chief Instructor at the Penrith tunnel has one of the records for the most head down spins, he taught me so I thought that the fact that he had a record was awesome and it made me want to go for it, Gales told The Western Weekender newspaper.
Gales said dancing since the age of 3 helped prepare her for the rigors of indoor skydiving.
I really like flying because there are so many different possibilities, having that dancing and gymnastic background, you can be really creative and experimental with how you use the wind and how that pushes your body around, she said.
I really fell in love with it and just kept working on it, when I came home on vacation I would train in the Penrith tunnel and do as much time as possible, now as an instructor I just want to spread that love of flight, Gales said.

Professor of Law at the Canterbury University, a former Judicial Officer of the European Court of Human Rights and a former Adviser to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Prof.Dinesh K Gunasekera said the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka had lost its legitimacy the preceding day following its pronouncement against the Presidents gazette dissolving Parliament.
The Court has ignored the pulse of the people, the supremacy of a sovereign nation and put the pulse of the law above that supremacy in passing this verdict, he pointed out.
It has challenged the franchise of the people which was the underlying principle of the Presidents dissolution of Parliament.
What if a referendum is to be held over holding an election and people voted for it it this respect and won it, he asked. What will be the state of judiciary then, where will it run for cover; would the executive and the legislature protect them
The Courts have ignored that that the masses have not voted for the 19th Amendment. What had been the Constitution of Sri Lanka at the time that the President of this country was elected into power, has also been ignored, he said.
He said there were only three judges of the seven- member judge bench that were with one voice up until the last moment till they sat in judgment on the bench over the petitions.
Unlike in other cases, the Supreme Court had some foreign diplomats constantly visiting its premises throughout the process of this case being heard.Some of these foreign agents were from the US, the UK, the European Union and Canada.They were seen sending messages to Lord-only-knows who, until the verdict was read out, he said.
The Courts could have learnt a lot from the Jammu-Kashmir case in which the Supreme Court of that state declared that it refuses to interfere with the decision of Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik to dissolve the state assembly of that state.The tenure of the state was till October 2020 in this case.

Teens and Sports: The Exercise-Mental Health Link
Teen sports can have a major impact on quality of life. Physical activity has significant benefits for teen mental health. Therefore, each teen needs to find a way to reap those benefits. For some kids, dance, yoga, and hiking are good options. In addition, for many teens, high school sports are an accessible and enjoyable way to get moving. Teen basketball, teen baseball, intramural sports, and youth track clubs are all options for adolescents.
Teen Sports and Mental Health
Moreover, youth athletes have the opportunity to gain benefits that go beyond physical activity. Specifically, teen sports also provide self-esteem, teamwork skills, and a close community of peers and supportive adults.
The Impact of School Sports on Teen Mental Health
Science provides evidence of the positive impact of teen sports. According to a Canadian study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, students who play team sports in grades 8 through 12 have less stress and better mental health as young adults.
In the study, 850 students from 10 Canadian schools were surveyed about their participation in school sports, such as basketball, soccer, track and field, wrestling, and gymnastics.
Sports, Exercise, and Teen Mental Health
Subsequently, three years after graduation, researchers followed up with the participants. Specifically, they asked them questions about how often they experienced depressive symptoms and the amount of stress in their lives. Additionally, they asked them to rate their mental health on a scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).
The researchers found that youth who were involved in school sports had better scores on all three mental health assessments, compared with those who did not play sports at all. Therefore, the study found that playing school sports during adolescent years is significantly linked to lower depression symptoms, lower perceived stress, and better self-rated mental health in young adulthood.
In other words, playing school sports from ages 12 to 17 protects young people from poor mental health four years later.
According to study co-author Catherine Sabiston, PhD, of the University of Toronto, Team sports offer a heightened emphasis on group goals, social support, and sense of connection that provide more opportunity for learning adaptive coping strategies that can be essential for long-term mental health.
The Exercise-Mental Health Link
Why do teen sports benefit mental health Scientists have been exploring the link between exercise and mood for more than 100 years. As a result, a large body of research shows that physical activity improves mental health. In particular, exercise decreases symptoms of depression.
Moreover, physical inactivity is associated with the development of psychological disorders, according to research. Thus, being inactive puts teens at a higher risk of developing mental high conditions.
However, scientists are not entirely sure why this is true.
While the investigation continues, researchers and mental health professionals have pinpointed some of the reasons.
Specifically, both biological and psychological factors come into play.
What Happens When We Exercise
Here are some of the reasons why exercise is helpful in boosting teen mental health.
Exercise positively impacts levels of serotonin, a chemical that helps regulate mental health.
Furthermore, exercise releases endorphins, the bodys natural happy chemicals.
Levels of the stress hormone cortisol go down when we exercise.
Additionally, physical activity also stimulates the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which improves mood.
Teen sports, as well as other outdoor activities, get teens outside so they can experience the benefits of time in nature.
Young people who develop an athletic skill feel more positive about their bodies and their physical abilities. Therefore, their self-esteem improves.
When we are doing something that absorbs all our attention, such as sports or another physical activity, we are distracted from stressful and negative thoughts.
Athletics and other physical activities protect against substance use disorder. (Well discuss this in depth later in this article.)
Moreover, when teens do physical activities during the day, they sleep better at night. Sleep is essential for maintaining teen mental health.
Research on Physical Activity and Depression
Regular exercise makes a significant positive difference in terms of depression. Many studies demonstrate how physical activity counteracts depressive symptoms in both teens and adults.
Moreover, multiple studies have confirmed these results.

TNA desires federal state: MP Premajayantha
Parliamentarian Susil Premajayantha said that there were no political prisoners in the country but those who were convicted for numerous offences, including terrorism.
He was speaking at a press conference held in Colombo, yesterday.
He added that the number of high-profile assassination cases such as those of former Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, former Minister Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, and D.M. Dassanayake were still open and that the suspects were still in remand custody.
More than 50 cases are being heard in High Courts; the prisoners are those convicted of assassinating people with explosives, Premajayantha said.
Two of the suspects involved in the murder of two policemen in Batticaloa were linked to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) intelligence wing, he added.
Newspapers have reported that United National Party Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe has promised the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) the immediate release of political prisoners, Premajayantha said.
He added that during 2001, the TNA said that the LTTE was the representative of the Tamil community. The TNA was formed in 2001 and 15 of its members were elected to Parliament that same year.
In 2004, the party had 22 members in Parliament, he said, adding that it had abstained from contesting the 2015 Presidential election.
Premajayantha said that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had promised the abolition of the Executive Presidency to the TNA. The country would be a federal state if the Executive Presidency were to be abolished, he added.
The request for this abolition had come from the TNA; they wish to set up a federal state, he added.

TNA wants UNP to release political prisoners
The high-ups of the United National Party (UNP) and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) categorically denied last morning signing any secret, private or political agreement between them at Temple Trees necessitating the full implementation of the 13 Amendment, releasing ex-LTTE cadres from prisons, or withdrawing Army from the North.
TNA MP Charles Nirmalanathan yesterday said they had but discussed their problems with UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
We discussed particularly releasing our peoples lands from military occupation, freeing those political prisoners held in government custody, and being vested with more governing powers to the Northern and Eastern Provinces, Nirmalanathan said.
We never signed any agreement with the UNP, he said.
Nirmalanathan said Wickremesinghe told them that he does not have powers to release political prisoners, but the President has.
The TNA member said, the President had not acceded to our request for releasing the political prisoners for the past three and half years.
Asked whether the TNA had pressed conditions on the UNP to extend its support to the current political scenario, he replied in negation stating that they did not present such an agenda.
Asked how was it on the political side of things in terms of the Constitution that had been prepared at the Parliamentary Select Committee level, Nirmalanathan said those provisions had been drafted by a Committee of Constitutional experts.
We told UNP that the Constitutional provisions related to devolution power to the Tamil people, which was prepared by Parliamentary Select Committee and the Constitutional experts had to be implemented to address the problems of the Tamil people, he said.
Wickremesinghe had reportedly told the TNA MPs that devolution of power had to take place within an undivided country.
It was complete falsehood to say that we agreed upon any terms that will lead to any division of the country, there was no such document, he said.
United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP S, B, Disanayaka said on Tuesday that the UNP as it stands today is dictated by the TNA.
TNA MP Sumanthiran is dictating terms on the UNP, he said.
The TNA has offered its support to the UNP because Wickremesinghe had agreed to their terms, he said, he will agree with anything and anyone to stay in political power.

UNP assures TNA of granting more powers to PCs - Susil
UNP Parliamentarian Ranil Wickremesinghe has given an assurance to the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) that he will ensure Provincial Councils get more powers than scoop of power delegated to these PCs under the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, UPFA MP Susil Premajayantha.
He said that Wickremesinghe has given this assurance to save the face of the TNA as public trust in the party is weaning
He said that the TNA is becoming unpopular among the people in the North and the party has done nothing for the province for the past three years.
Premajayantha said that former Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Vigneswaran is raising the same issue with the TNA hierarchy.
The TNA has faced a crisis as the people in the Northern Province inquire from them as to what they did for the people for the past three years, by supporting UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, he said.
He said that Wickremesinghe has been left with no option other than to reaching an agreement with the TNA. Wickremesinghe has given an assurance to the TNA that he will ensure that Provincial Councils get more powers than scoop of power delegated to these PCs under the 13th Amendment to the Constitution while retaining countrys unitary status, he said.
Premajayantha added that only 103 out of 107 members of the United National Front had expressed support to Parliamentarian Ranil Wickremesinghe at the confidence in Parliament on Wednesday, though 107 members got elected to Parliament from the UNF and the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. The motion was adopted with the support of the Tamil National Alliance which has 14 Members in Parliament.
He said that Wickremesinghe cannot run a government as the TNA does not join the government .
The TNA Parliamentarians have already declared that they would not be a part of the UNF government. If they do not become a part of the UNF government, Wickremesinghe will have to run a government with 103 members, he said.
He added that TNA leader R.Sampanthan and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayke are facing the danger of losing the posts of Opposition Leader and Chief Opposition Whip too.
He added that a Unity Government was formed by adopting a proposal in Parliament as the UNP did not have the required majority.
The Cabinet stood dissolved following the SLFPs exit from the Unity Government.
The Tamil National Alliance, United National Party and the JVP ACMC, SLMC are against holding an election at this juncture byt SLMC and ACMC have forgotten that the election in the Eastern Province is yet to be held.
If they do not show hesitation in facing election, why did they file petitions against the dissolving of parliament, he queried.
He added that the United National Party is behind moving petitions against the dissolution of parliament by the President.
People should be given an opportunity to appoint a government of their choice with the collapse of Unity Government, he said.
The Jathika Hela Urumaya is now voting with the TNA while the JVP abstained without taking sides as a strategic measure.
He said that they would have been able to take crucial decisions for the benefit of the people at all levels if the Cabinet of Ministers continued to function.
We were planning to grant many concessions to the people and they include tax concessions and a certified price for paddy farmers.All these decisions had to be put on hold after 122 Parliamentarians representing the UNF, TNA and the JVP obtained a court order preventing the Cabinet of Ministers holding office.
He added that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa took over the Premiership with an objective of calling for a snap election.
He wants to form stable government to strenghthen countrys economy, Premajayantha said.
Premajayantha asked as to why nobody is talking about human rights violations, when elections have not been held for six Provincial Councils which stand dissolved for months.
Hakeem keeps mum over the delay in conducting election in the Eastern Province while Vigneswaran does not ask as to why Northern Provincial Council election is not held, he added.
We respect and accept the judgement given by the judiciary. We are working together to rescue the country from this precarious situation, MP Premajayantha said.

Is the US heading for a recession
Recessions are painful. Shrinking output tends to mean huge job losses, stagnant incomes and widespread misery.
And when that recession is in the worlds largest economy, its a major headache for its trading partners, not least the UK which sells 30% of its exports to the US.
Investors are increasingly concerned theres an American recession brewing.
Of course, they, and also economists, can get it wrong. But is there a sure-fire way of predicting recessions
Government bond markets may be one the most accurate form of financial tea leaves.
A central bank study in the US found that the bond markets had successfully foreshadowed all five US recessions since 1955.
Those bonds, known as Treasuries in the US, are issued as a form of borrowing by governments, to fund spending. They come with different lengths of maturity - and offer investors a rate of return, paid out in regular installments.
That rate is a fixed proportion of the ultimate value of the bond. As bonds can be freely traded, their prices change.
If demand is high, the price rises, and the bonds rate of return relative to the market price, or its yield, falls. Conversely, a lower price means a rising yield.
What influences the price of bonds Their relative attractiveness compared to other investments (if the yield is high and so price low, buyers are likely to be lured in) and also, expectations of further interest rate movements.
What does this have to do with a recession Analysts monitor the yields of bonds across the range of maturities, right up to 30 years to plot the yield curve.
The lower the yield, the lower the expected interest rate, the worse the economy is expected to be performing.
Bonds with a longer maturity would be expected to have a higher return anyway, to compensate holders for inflation and a longer holding period.
Typically, when the outlook is for activity to expand at a healthy clip, the yield curve will slope upwards, implying interest rates on an upward trend.
But if the yield curve inverts - normally meaning the yield on a 10-year bond is below that of 2-year bond, it serves as an economic health warning.
But how good are these curves for predicting recessions
The bond markets were dependable signals of all the recessions in the US since 1955. BBC New

## Title: THE VOTE AND THE VERDICT
## Supertitle:

THE VOTE AND THE VERDICT
Leader of PLOT and TNA MP D. Dharmalingam stated that he believes that Ranil Wickremesinghe has handed in a written assurance of several promises. The promises are said to include agreements on constitutional amendments, freedom for political prisoners, land issue and several other matters. The MP noted that discussions were also held on International courts in line with the UN resolutions. He reiterated that he believes that Ranil Wickremesinghe has handed in this written assurance. (News First, December 12, 2018)
The Westminster model is looking awkward at Westminster. The Prime Minister does not seem to enjoy the confidence of the House but is not going for a vote of confidence. Indeed she has postponed without further notice, a major vote on Brexit at the end of a five day debate. Meanwhile the Scottish National Party has assured Labour of its support but Labour is not keen to assume office other than through an election.
There is of course the vexed question of Northern Ireland, which provides an excellent reason as to why Sri Lanka should move beyond the 13th amendment in the direction of substantially greater autonomy, as is reported (in the Lankadeepa) to have been pledged on November 29th at 4:30 pm at Temple Trees in a discussion between the TNA and the ex-Prime Minister, Wickremesinghe. There is a possibility of the border between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain becoming a hard border and therefore the need has arisen for support for any Brexit arrangement from Northern Ireland, amounting to a veto. This is the famous Northern Ireland backstop.
Similarly, any further devolution in Sri Lanka and the Northern and Eastern provinces will have a right of veto over any legislation passed in Parliament and may even have a hammerlock on Parliament itself. If the veto is ignored, the inter-provincial border may become a hard border within our island, and may be followed by a Referendum for Independence as in Catalonia.
Geneva resolution
This is what makes the next few days so important for the fate of Sri Lanka. If a Ranil Wickremesinghe-led UNF is backstopped by the TNA, and if the Court rules that the dissolution was unconstitutional, then what are the scenarios that unfold If on the other hand, a Wickremesinghe-led UNF is backstopped by the TNA but the Supreme Court rules that dissolution is permissible, what alternative scenario emerges into view
The UNF backstopped i.e. propped up by the TNA, will be perceived by the electorate as exactly what it is: a UNP-TNA government. Driven by its own arrogant dogmatism, such a government will move fast on three tracks: neoliberal economics/foreignization of strategic assets, Constitutional change as promised to the TNA and JVP, and the implementation of the Geneva resolution. Any of the three policy trajectories, in and of itself would be polarizing, unpopular, and inflammable. Any combination of any two would be highly toxic. A blend of all three would be explosive. The resultant social discontent would be exacerbated by the heightened perception of a minoritarian, foreign-backed, elitist administration. A Ranil-TNA axis is just the kind of government the majority would love to hateit would be a 1956 clash of civilizations on steroids!
Any serious Constitutional change and a Referendum would be unavoidable. In todays world, no neoliberal government would win a Referendum. A defeat at a Referendum would have a snowball effect on the immovably fixed Presidential election this time next year. The effect would not only be one of snowballing. An effort at a federalizing Constitution, de jure or de facto, would have a radicalizing effect on the Presidential electiona radicalization that would not depend any more, on the choice of the candidate, but would suffuse the mass mood, drive the campaign and dictate the candidate.
If the Court decision goes against the dissolution, it would be widely perceived as a deprivation of the democratic right to vote at a moment of grave crisis, and thereby the silencing of the voice of the majority of the citizenry. If the majority feels voiceless at a time when painful neoliberal economic shock therapy is administered and infuriating Constitutional reforms are attempted by a minoritarian elitist government, catastrophe becomes predictable.
As a recent survey showed, only 18% of Sri Lanka is urban while 82 % is rural. The majority of the citizenry living in the heartland must never lose its faith that the institutions serve the nations interests rather than those of a microscopic social minority. Already the chatter is of interlocking directorates as it were; of interfacing social networks of unrepresentative, indeed vaguely alien social elites, having entered a compact against the interests and aspirations of the majority.
This perception is the stuff of Populism everywhere, be it nationalist or not, and in any case, populism is usually nationalist though nationalism is not always populist. Populism is the ideology that projects a socially unrepresentative minority, the elite, against the socially unrepresented majority. Insofar as the socially unrepresentative elite the Few-- dominates economics and the institutions, the System is seen as inherently, structurally, undemocratic. The dominant social compact between elites is usually supported by foreigners or neoliberal globalists. Therefore it is seen as anti-national, even alien. The struggle for democracy is therefore linked with the struggle for sovereignty, and the latter is identified with the majority of the citizenrythe many. And the Many, the Multitude, The People, are The Nation (the people-nation as Gramsci had it or the nation-class as Amilcar Cabral termed it). By contrast, the elite, the few, are the anti-nation. In Sri Lanka, the majority perceives itself as an oppressed nation, a proletarian nation.
Supreme Court
Only the Supreme Court can put the brakes on this ongoing process of mass perception and healthily transform it, by unfreezing the democratic mechanism of elections and channeling polarization into the safe mainstream.
If on the other hand, events go in another direction, the widening and deepening perception of us vs. them will take rootwith Them being seen as in 1956 as a decadent elite. What is different is that unlike in 1956, the whole game, the whole System, will be seen as rigged in favour of the alien/minoritarian elite.
This would mean, at its least drastic, a massive defeat for the neoliberals at a Referendum on the Constitution. Far more significant would be the inevitable Presidential election in exactly a years time, i.e. this time next year, 2019 (not 2020). That will not be won by a neoliberal, and any UNF-TNA administration that lasts till 2020 will have to face parliamentary elections under such an adversarial Presidency. Still more importantly, a delayed and deferred (by the Supreme Court) majoritarian outpouring against the alien,  culturally decadent neoliberal urban elite which elects a winner at the Presidential election will be driven as SWRD Bandaranaike was in 1956, to implement an agenda that changes the rule of the game. It may well go beyond 1956, to change the dice that are seen to be loaded in favour of alien minorities, plug the institutional loopholes (gouging out the Commissions packed with NGO/civil society types), and change the very model of the Sri Lankan State (after a victory at the 2020 parliamentary elections) to that of centripetal and centralized, unambiguously vertical power along Eurasian or East Asian/Far Eastern lines.

Yemen's warring parties have agreed to a ceasefire in Hodeidah, a major flashpoint in the country's war, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Thursday.The besieged rebel-held port city is an entry point for 70% of foreign humanitarian aid into the country, according to the United Nations, which has described Hodeidah as a "lifeline" for Yemen's war-ravaged population."We have reached an agreement on Hodeidah port and city which will see a mutual redeployment of forces from the port and the city and an establishment of governorate-wide ceasefire," Guterres said. "UN will play a leading role in the port, and this will facilitate humanitarian access."The ceasefire announcement came at the conclusion of the first direct talks in more than two years between representatives of Yemen's internationally recognized government, which Saudi Arabia supports, and the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.International pressure has intensified for a ceasefire as the humanitarian crisis worsens in Yemen after more than three years of war. - CNN
