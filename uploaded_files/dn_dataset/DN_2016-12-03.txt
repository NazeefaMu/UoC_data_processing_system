Sri Lankan couple with 'well-founded fear' granted refugee status

A Sri Lankan couple fearing harm after their family members were shot and killed by underworld criminal have been granted refugee status.
The husband and wife told the Immigration and Protection Tribunal they feared for their lives because of familial connection to the husband's late father and uncle, who had both been allegedly assassinated.
The uncle was shot and killed allegedly by underworld criminal after he attempted to uncover Sri Lankan government corruption and the father killed after seeking justice for the uncle's killing.
The alleged killers have not be prosecuted and remain at large.
The husband is Sinhalese and a Buddhist, and was born in Colombo in the late 1980s.
After completing his schooling in 2007, he moved to a country named by the tribunal only as "O" to live with his uncle, father and older brother.
The uncle started receiving threats and on April 10, 2010 made a police complaint.
A day later he was shot but didn't prove fatal, but died after he was shot a second time on a busy street on a separate occasion.
A drug dealer was charged for the murder but was not convicted.
In October that year, the father sought protection by writing to the President.
But the father was also shot and killed by unknown assailants.
Reports stated that the killer as someone hired by an "underworld figure".
The husband started receiving threatening phone calls in 2012 and 2013 while overseas. He returned to Sri Lanka in mid 2013 after his visa had expired.
But while returning from a hospital appointment, a car they were travelling in was shot at.
"After the shot there was great commotion...his mother, sister-in-law and wife were crying and screaming," the tribunal was told.
The husband was granted a one-month New Zealand limited purpose visa in November 2013.
However, he did not use it because he did not want to leave his younger brother as the only remaining male family member in Sri Lanka.
In April 2014 after three men attacked his mother and asked about the whereabouts of her children, he realised he needed to leave.
He fled to New Zealand and was joined by the wife a few months later.
The tribunal also heard evidence from the husband's older brother and the brother's wife. It accepted the credibility of the couple and witnesses' accounts.
"On the facts as found, the Tribunal is satisfied, that there is a real chance that the husband and the wife will be seriously harmed if they were to return to Sri Lanka, by (underworld criminal) or his associates, or by (Mahinda) Rajapaksa supporters seeking revenge for attempts to bring him to justice for the deaths and uncover political links to the criminal underworld," the tribunal decision said.
"The husband and wife's relationship to (the husband's older brother) and the fact that they would be the only direct family members in Sri Lanka mean there is a real chance they will be harmed."
It found they each had a "well-founded fear" of being persecuted and concluded the couple were entitled to be recognised as refugees.

Chapecoense: Brazil plane crash football team a fairytale story with tragic ending'
The incredible rise of Brazilian football team Chapecoense has reached a tragic ending, after a plane crash in Colombia killed the majority of their team.
Six people survived the crash in Medellin, which was taking the team to compete in the first leg of the Copa Sudamericana final on Wednesday.
They include defenders Alan Ruschel and Helio Zemper, and reserve goalkeeper Jakson Follman. The club's coaching staff and journalists were among the 77 passengers.
Chapecoense were in the Brazilian fourth tier in 2009, but had recently made themselves a national force before their run in South American football's secondary continental competition - the equivalent of the Europa League.
BBC Brasil's Fernando Duarte said: Their story is a fantastic fairytale, but now it has reached a tragic end.
The football world has paid tribute with players such as Brazil and Chelsea defender David Luiz counting former team-mates among those who lost their lives. Teams in Brazil have said they will give players to Chaecoense so that they can continue as a club.
Leicester City-like run
The club from southern Brazil were founded in 1973 and only won promotion to the country's top division in 2014, but victory over two legs in their first continental final would have seen them qualify for the Copa Libertadores, South America's premier competition.
The Brazilian Football Confederation has announced a seven-day mourning period, during which all matches have been postponed, while the Brazilian government has declared three days of mourning nationwide.
Chapecoense's Leicester City-like run in the Sudamericana was described as a massive achievement for a very small club by Duarte.
The president of Chapecoense's guiding committee, David de Nes Filho, summed up the sentiment at the club in an interview on Brazilian radio Globo.
It was not just a group founded on mutual respect; it was a family, he said.
We lived in harmony, with great happiness. Before boarding the flight, they said they were going to turn their dreams into reality. The dream ended this morning.
Clubs - including Chelsea, Barcelona and Real Madrid - paid tribute to the victims during training, and a minute's silence was held at both EFL Cup quarter-final matches in England on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Al Jazira and Al Shabab held minute silences for Chapecoense boss Caio Junior, who managed both Arabian Gulf League clubs.
The biggest game in the club's history
This is a club that as recently as 2009 were still in Brazil's fourth division. It is only in the last three years that they have established themselves as a national force.
This was to have been the biggest game in the club's history. Now we wait anxiously to find out how many players have survived this terrible accident..
The Copa Sudamericana is the second biggest cup competition in South American football, to have reached the final, after coming from Brazil's fourth division, in just six or seven years is a truly remarkable achievement which seems to have been interrupted by this terrible tragedy.

New president of Dubai Lions SC giving expatriate community dynamic leadership
DUBAI: Dubai Lankans are set to roar in all its glory as they compete in the ongoing Dubai Rugby Sevens after a hiatus of three years with renewed vigor following a rebranding of the club.
The Sri Lankan expatriate community in the UAE will have plenty of reason to cheer when the new-look Dubai Lankans carry the Lion flag in the Gulf Mens Social segment of this annual rugby event at The Sevens from December 1-3.
Founded in 2001 as a rugby club and regular participants in the Dubai Rugby Sevens for eight years, the Dubai Lankans were in danger of fading into history.
However, a club that struggled for survival got a fresh lease of life under the dynamic leadership of its newly elected President Mark Kirby who has repositioned it as the Dubai Lankans Sports Club since taking charge just over a month ago.
My only involvement initially was in finding a sponsor. I saw the passion and talent of the boys here in Dubai. Bringing them together to be part of a tournament is really great, said Kirby who later accepted the Presidency following the request of Dubai Lankans captain Kusal Wickramage and Operations Manager Ifthikar Zuhair to head the club.
Theyve been working very hard. They are getting fitter. We can see how much they have progressed. There are some really good players in the team ready for the Dubai Sevens. So we are getting excited, said Kirby whose passion for sports knows bounds apart.
Dubai Lankans started off primarily for rugby. We renamed it as Dubai Lankans Sports Club to allow us in the future to expand the club a bit further into other disciplines. Starting with rugby, then we will look at swimming, running, and cricket. We are building a sports club that enables us to support some of the talent in Dubai, said Kirby, an hotelier in one of Dubais iconic hotels.
Blitz Blank is the sole sponsor for the Dubai Lankans team at the Dubai Rugby Sevens.
Im a sports fan. Rugby in Germany is not so recognised but I know in this area (Dubai) it is one of the famous sports events. Im looking forward to have a look at it. I watched it several times on TV not live. This is the beginning of my involvement in rugby, said Thomas Schindler, Managing Director of Blitz Blank who also feels connected to Sri Lankans like Kirby renowned for his work as a philanthropist in the island nation.
Kirby ran the Colombo Marathon in 2014 to raise US $6,000 for a school playground development project in the North East of Sri Lanka amongst other projects in 2015 and 2016.
However, Dubai Lankan Sports Club is not just necessarily for Sri Lankan people. The expat community in Dubai is diverse and we want to be open to everyone, said Kirby, who hails from north of England.
Anybody can come and join the club. It is very much open to the expatriate community. We are encouraging people who got sports in their blood. Lot of people in our team have played rugby for many years. Some of them professionally back home. They come to work in Dubai. They dont necessarily get the opportunities to participate in something like the Dubai Rugby Sevens which is a huge achievement, said Kirby who wants to give back to the expatriate community in Dubai through sports.
We have so many people who have got amazing skills. One thing we want to make sure is to take it to grass root. Make sure we put foundations in place because Dubai Lankans has a great history. Dubai Lankans Sports Club name is complete. We will have captains managing the four disciplines. We are building a revised profile for the Dubai Lankans and will launch the new website shortly. You can also currently follow us on Facebook at Dubai Lankans, he explained.
Ive often helped many teams out here. Most people know I love sports and I put teams together to play sport. It makes the sport a lot more fun, he added lauding the Dubai Lankans captain for pulling the team together and being a tough leader.
We have a good team which has improved by training over the past five months. Most of them have played school or club rugby in Sri Lanka. Our goal is to reach the Cup final, said Kusal, a product of Maliyadeva Model College, Kurunegala who has represented the club six times at the Dubai Rugby Sevens.
Leonard Malcolm, a former Dharmaraja player, and Niresh Fernando, who turned out for Ananda and Police, are two other veterans in a side comprising new young blood.
Among them are Charith Kanishka, an old boy of Thurstan, who played for Doha Lions in the Dubai Rugby Sevens and Nawavi Mohomed from Isipathana who represented Qatar Lions.
Another former Thurstanite Nilantha Chathuranga, Harris Muheed, who represented Western Province, Hashan Lakpahana (Isipathana), Don Jayantha, Dilan Jayasundara, Chalith Udeesha, Shiwanka Ranasinha, Sajith Lakmal and Chamara Prasanga who represented CH and FC complete the Dubai Lankans squad coached by Rajitha Ranawana and Mark Sansony.

Cricket at Prince of Wales College -140 years
John Still who arrived to the then Ceylon in 1897 was one of the mostremarkable Englishmen who visited our country in modern times. He was agreat lover of Ceylon and famous for his literary works. Unlike most of hiscompatriots he foresaw that the sun could set on the British Empire.
Discussing the survivals of the different periods of foreign rule he opined, Some future observer will doubtless note that he selected for survival from among the manifold ways of the Englishmen. To hazard a prediction, I would give my vote to cricket.
A remarkable prophecy from a remarkable man remarkably fulfilled up to the hilt almost one hundred years after John Still first set foot on our shores, when Sri Lanka emerged dramatically to become the World Champions in One Day Cricket in 1996.
Cricket once known as Englands national game has indeed taken route as the favourite sport in the countries which formed the Jewel in the Crown of her far flung Empire India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. 1996 was christened by the world media as Crickets Greatest Year it has been the centennial year for cricket in several lands. The centenary of the Victoria Cricket Association in Australia, centenary of the Queens Park Cricket Club in Trinidad in the West Indies and the centenary of Prince of Wales College Inter Schools Organized Cricket.
Cambrian cricket has made significant contributions in all sectors of the sport in Sri Lanka, The Schools, Clubs Mercantile, Government Services, Defence Services, Corporations and in the field of cricket administrators some of them have performed brilliantly, gained much fame and figured prominently in representative, National and International cricket.
Prince and Princess of Wales Colleges of Moratuwa, the two prestigious and esteemed educational institutions of the island have produced men and women of calibre from time to time. It was founded by one of the illustrious sons of Moratuwa and one of the greatest philanthropists of our country Charles Henry de Soysa on 14 September 1876 and the 140th anniversary of founding of these two schools fell this year. To mark this historic event of their Alma-Maters the two energetic Past Pupils Associations of either schools Prince of Wales College Old Boys Association and Princess of Wales College Old Girls Union formed a Joint Committee under the presidentship of two Principals J. W. S. Siriwardena and Mrs. Malani Samarakoon and celebrated this event on a grand scale.
The history of cricket in Moratuwa goes back to the year 1865 and the cricket at Prince of Wales can claim a history almost as old as the College. This noble game was introduced to the college by its first Principal W. S. Gunawardene in 1876 under the guidance and blessings of our
Revered Founder Charles Henry de Soysa and the cricket at Prince of Wales was played initially by the Masters of the College Staff and it was all friendly games.
When constructing the school De Soysa did not forget to give them a play ground and a pavilion.
The first pavilion was constructed where the now Prefects Room and the Cadets Room are functioning. In 1954 the Old Boys Association demolished this building and put up the existing building.
After demolishing the former pavilion a new pavilion was constructed by the
Old Boys Association where it is presently situated. In 1987 a distinguished and a very loyal old boy and a past first eleven cricket captain H. R. Fernando donated a new pavilion.
It was only after the establishment of the Prince of Wales College Cricket Club in 1896 by the then Principal M. J. G. C. Mendis serious Inter-School cricket began and the first ever Inter-School cricket match was played against Royal College, Colombo on 13 February 1897. The Cambrians first eleven cricket captain was J. G. Fernando and his opposite number was R. A.
I. Ekanayake. Royal College won the contest by a massive innings and 247 runs in the match played at St. Sebastians Hill, Pettah, Colombo the grounds of Royal College (During those days Royal College was situated at St. Sebastian Hill, Pettah and later shifted to the present venue at Reid Avenue, Colombo 7.)
In the same year Cambrians played against Wesley College and won by an innings and 7 runs to register their first ever victory in first eleven cricket and in the next outing they lost to S. Thomas College, Mutwal, Colombo by 45 runs. (During this period S. Thomas College was situated at Mutwal and it was later shifted to the present venue at Mt. Lavinia.).
Their Principal was J. G. C. Mendis, Master-in-Charge Claude Orr and the coach was McHeyzer. Since then cricket has blossomed at school and today it has raised upto sixteen encounters for a season (September to March) culminating with the Big Match with arch rivals St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa.
In the early years Cambrian and Moratuwa cricketers were branded as, Matting Wicket Cricketers and they were debarred from selection for representative cricket. In 1996 when one of their distinguished and a very loyal old boy Lakshman Gomes was at the helm of the college with his blessings the Old Boys Association took the initiative and put up a turf wicket in addition to the existing matting wicket.
Maintaining of cricket at college is not an easy task because cricket is a very expensive game. In this context the Old Boys Association, the Cambrian Past Cricketers Association, the Cambrian Cricket Wing, the Affiliated Old Boys Groups, the Past Cricketers, Parents are helping financially in numerous ways.
Since introduction of Inter-Schools cricket in 1896 to-date thousands of cricketers from different age categories have excelled and those who have performed well deserves recognition. However this article is about Cambrian Cricket which all the past and present college cricketers will understand if there is any omission.
It is with great gratitude one must remember all the former cricketers, past Principals, Members of the College Staff, the Masters-in-Charge of Cricket , Prefects of Games, Coaches, Ground Staff and all others who have laboured to keep the Purple, Gold and Maroon flag flying in the years gone by.
We should especially remember the Principal who introduced cricket at college W. S. Gunawardene with the blessings of our Revered founder Charles Heny de Soysa, the founder of the College Cricket Club J. G. C. Mendis and Colossus of Cricket J. B. C. Rogrigo.
Rodrigo is mainly responsible for organizing the Big Match versus St. Sebastians College in 1933 which has become the most popular and exiting social event at Moratuwa.
Later the Limited Overs cricket match was introduced in 1981 by that cricket crazy Principal M. E. C. Fernando.
In the 1890s Old Boys played against Present Boys and when the Old Boys Association was formed in 1904 by J. G. C. Mendis who was at the helm of the school and first President of the OBA he introduced the Old Boys versus Present Boys annual cricket match and in 1904 and 1905 the Present Boys won and in1906 the Old Boys registered their first win. Since then this match has been an annual feature on the Old Boys Day.
After gaining Test status the first Cambrian to captain Sri Lanka in Tests was D. S. de Silva in 1983 against New Zealand at Christchurch. He also became the first Cambrian to captain Sri Lanka in a Limited Overs Match on the same tour.
The first ever International Test match for blind cricketers was between Sri Lanka and Australia played at Ratmalana and Moratuwa in 1982. Old Cambrian S. M. Benjamin captained the team and Australia won the match.
Another Cambrian Norman Anthony was a member of the team and he carried away the Best Totally Blind Batsman Trophy.
The establishment on Public Schools Cricket Association was formed in 1947. It was a step in the right direction and the Principal of Wesley College Rev. James Cartman was elected as the President and their Principal J. B. C. Rodrigo was the Vice President. Later Rodrigo succeeded Rev. Cartman as the President and held the post with distinction.
Later the present Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association was formed and another three Cambrian Principals M. E. C. Fernando, H. L. B. Gomes and Rohana Karunaratne held the post with distinction.
One of the most outstanding Cambrian cricketers of today is young Kusal Mendis who made his mark against the Australians recently with a classice knock of 176.

Red Bull Ride My Wave lights up the Southern waves
After last years intense battles on the waves of the Eastern coast, the much-coveted event Red Bull Ride My Wave returns for its third edition on December 10th and 11th 2016 at Kabalana Beach, Ahangama.
This year will see 100 surfers both local and international searching for fast lefts and hollow rights aiming to score high on the judges boards which will give our top 3 winners a grand prize of US$ 3000 (1ST PLACE  US$1500, 2ND PLACE  US$1000 AND 3RD PLACE  US$500) securing the winner with the title and bragging rights of being known as the King of the Wave.
Red Bull Ride My Wave began in 2014, where surfers from the East Coast were pitted against their fellow surfers from the South Coast in a quest to determine which region was home to the islands best surfers. Hosted by Costa Rican Pro Surfer, Diego Naranjo, the East Coast team emerged victorious and went on to represent Sri Lanka at Red Bull Both Ways in the Maldives, where they placed 2nd, 3rd and 4th respectively.
This year, the event will be managed and judged by 3 fully accredited ISA judges with 2 having worked and judged in WSL events around the world along with Kai Linder, the Surf Director. Kai who was part of the 2015 edition of the event had this to say, I am immensely happy to be returning to Sri Lanka this year for another edition of Red Bull Ride My Wave. Last year, the judges, and myself got to experience the incredible hospitality, amazing food and fun waves on offer in the area around Aragum Bay. This year we look forward to experiencing another area of Sri Lanka and I hope to find even more amazing surf spots and to meeting more local surfers. The event helps to promote the development of contest surfing in this emerging surf market, as Sri Lankan surfers will hopefully join the global contest scene in the very near future.
The southern waves are not like the ones up east, said Asanga Waduge, Winner of Red Bull Ride My Wave 2015. We have to master their nature, then use it to our advantage. Were not just competing against surfers from our island, but also from those around the world. So you can be sure that Ill give it everything Ive got!

Ex-FIFA chief Blatter set to learn ban appeal
ZURICH: Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter will learn Monday whether his appeal against a six-year ban from football has been successful, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said on Friday.
Once the most powerful man in football, Blatter is serving a ban over ethics violations relating to a suspect $2 million payment he authorised in 2011 to former UEFA boss Michel Platini.
The 80-year-old Swiss served as FIFA chief from 1998 to 2015.
Both Blatter and Platini were originally banned for eight years by the sport's world governing body, but that was reduced to six years by a FIFA appeals panel in February. Platini had his ban cut by a further two years by CAS in May.
The result of Blatter's appeal will be made public at 1400 GMT (1500 local time) on Monday. A CAS statement confirmed: The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) will issue its decision in the arbitration procedure between Joseph S Blatter and the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) at 3.00pm (Swiss time) on Monday, December 5 2016.

League's mighty fall as Rockets halt Warriors' streak, Cavs lose
LOS ANGELES: James Harden's triple-double lifted the Houston Rockets to a 132-127 double-overtime triumph over Golden State on Thursday that snapped the Warriors' 12-game NBA winning streak.
Harden drained a three-pointer and converted a brace of free throws and Eric Gordon added a short jump shot as the Rockets finally separated themselves in the second overtime period of a game that included 14 lead changes, almost as many ties and plenty of early-season drama.
Big-time win on the road, said Harden, who finished with 29 points, 15 rebounds and 13 assists, his fourth triple-double of the season.
Ryan Anderson matched Harden's team-high point total and Gordon added 23 off the bench for the Rockets.
Kevin Durant scored 39 points and pulled down 13 rebounds for the Warriors, who hadn't lost since November 4.
Stephen Curry scored 28 points for the Warriors, but the NBA Most Valuable Player fouled out in the second extra period.
We had our moments, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. Especially in the first overtime we had a cushion -- I think we were up four. We kind of let it slip away at that point. They played a great game. I thought they deserved to win -- they out-played us.
Clippers rout Cavs
It wasn't even close in Cleveland, where the Los Angeles Clippers humbled the reigning champion Cavaliers 113-94 to snap a three-game skid.
Defeats at Detroit, Indiana and Brooklyn had the Clippers reeling, but on Thursday they looked more like the team that started the season 14-2. The Clippers handed out a season-high 33 assists, 11 of them by Blake Griffin.
They held the Cavaliers to 40.6 percent shooting, with Cavs superstar LeBron James making five of his 14 shots. They limited Cleveland to just nine three-pointers, the Cavs' first game in 16 this season with fewer than 10 from beyond the arc.
Up by eight at halftime, the Clippers out-scored the Cavaliers 27-15 in the third quarter to seize control of the contest.
Defensively, we were just locked in, Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. The reason was we respected them. They're the Cleveland Cavaliers. And, they get your respect. They get your attention. But the Cavaliers never really fired.
It was a weird game, James said. Especially in that first half, the second quarter the whistle was blowing so much we couldn't get in a rhythm. The game just kind of unravelled, we got in foul trouble ... they just broke our rhythm.
Things were a lot more tense in Memphis, where the Grizzlies rallied from a 14-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Orlando Magic 95-94.
Marc Gasol scored the game-winning points at the free-throw line with 12.2 seconds remaining, finishing with a team-high 25 points and five blocked shots.
In Salt Lake City, Goran Dragic scored 27 points and James Johnson chipped in 24 off the bench to help the Miami Heat escape with a 111-110 victory over the Jazz.
Wayne Ellington contributed 17 points off the bench for Miami, who weathered a late Jazz comeback bid to earn their third straight road victory.
Gordon Hayward scored a season-high 32 points -- his second straight game with at least 30 -- and Joe Johnson added 18 to pace the Jazz.
Utah boast a solid defense, but they couldn't keep the determined Heat from scoring 64 points in the paint.
We've been getting in the paint a lot this season, guard Wayne Ellington said. That's one of our strong suits is getting in the paint. We've (also) been getting it done from the outside, which opens up the paint even more for us.

BCCI goof-up shatters dreams of seven teenage cricketers
NEW DELHI: In a major goof-up, a month after announcing a 15-member squad for the Youth Asia Cup to be held later this month in Sri Lanka, the BCCI has told seven of them that they are ineligible for selection and thus ending their hopes of donning India colours.
The under-19 squad was scheduled to assemble in Bangalore for a preparatory camp from Friday but just a day before, BCCI informed seven of the players that they don't meet the criteria needed to qualify for the selection.
As per a report in *The Indian Express* , the BCCI committed the error after assuming that the date of birth for the cut-off year was 1997. However, the Asian Cricket Council had originally communicated that the year was 1-9-1998.
Consequently, selectors and joint secretary Amitabh Chaudhary were misinformed and on the basis of that, ended up selecting ineligible players for the tournament that starts from December 13 in Colombo.
It was a major goof-up. Luckily, it came to our notice now. Things could have been worse if we would have come to know about this after the team had landed in Sri Lanka. The selectors were informed and they quickly replaced those seven names, a BCCI official was quoted as saying by The Indian Express.
After realizing their mistake, the board didn't bother to release a statement and instead swiftly named the replacements on its official website. The seven players who have been replaced include opening batsman Sandeep Tomar, (Uttar Pradesh), Digvijay Rangi (Himachal Pradesh), Daryl S Ferrario (Kerala), Rishabh Bhagat (Punjab), Simarjit Singh (Delhi) Izan Sayed
(Maharashtra) and Chandan Sahini, (Hyderabad). Wicketkeeper-batsman Sandeep Tomar had completed all the formalities including getting the visa and passport but is now sad at missing the India cap by just eight days.
It was a matter of great joy but now I am feeling equally sad. My visa was done, and passport submitted. I was to go Bengaluru tomorrow and join the camp. My mother said, Don't worry, if you are lucky, you will get another chance in the future'. But I missed an India cap by just eight days, he was quoted as saying by the daily.
Rishabh, a medium pacer, was left heartbroken after BCCI informed him of the decision. I got a call from the BCCI... It has happened, now what can I say I was so happy but now am heartbroken, he said.
Himanshu Rana, Salman Khan, Harvik Desai, Yash Thakur, Heramb Parab, Vivekanand Tiwary and Het Patel have been named as the replacements.  TNN

Calorie Counter to help international sportspersons
A younger generation of Sri Lankan athletes are taking on more unconventional and novel sporting disciplines that are bringing global recognition to the country, but most of them are self-funded or lacking financial support to take their passion forward.
The latest of such self-motivated success stories comes in the form young power-lifter Dhanushka Kodikara, Gold Medalist at the 2015 Commonwealth Powerlifting Championships in Canada.
Dhanushka represented Sri Lanka at the 2016 World Open Powerlifting Championships organized by the International Powerlifting Federation in Orlando, Florida, USA in mid-November, the first time Sri Lanka was represented at a tournament of such global scale, with the participation of
43 powerlifting countries. Dhanushka went in to the tournament ranked 24th in the world in the 93kg category, and successfully completed his 2016 season ranked 13th at the World Championships.
Powerlifting is a sport that is rapidly going viral globally, and we need all the support we can get in Sri Lanka to strengthen our efforts to compete on the world stage, Dhanushka commented. My passion is what kept
me going, and thankfully, now I have a nutrition partner from Sri Lanka through Calorie Counter. What we would like to see is other businesses and corporates stepping up to support us, because through such partnerships, our success too has become more evident.
Having pioneered the health food option for health-conscious Sri Lankans, Calorie Counter haslaunched a bid to encourage and support this new wave of emerging athletes by sponsoring them as their Nutritional Partner, demonstrating the significance of a healthy diet and healthier lifestyle that athletes need.

England's injury concerns don't seem to be ending anytime soon, with Chris Woakes being the latest to join the list. The 27-year-old all-rounder was hit on the right thumb by a Mohammed Shami bouncer, which eventually got him dismissed on the fourth day (November 29) of the recently concluded third Test between India and England in Mohali.
He is reported to have suffered a tiny crack as per the England management, after he went for an X-ray at the end of the game. Earlier in the series, Woakes was left out of the second Test in Visakhapatnam with a sore knee. However, the England team management are hopeful of a quick
recovery and expect him to be fit in time for the fourth Test in Mumbai, starting on Thursday (December 8).
In addition, the 19-year-old England opener, Haseeb Hameed is returning home for an operation to his sore little finger on the left hand, which he sustained during the Mohali Test. His replacement is likely to be announced soon.

Vertonghen extends Spurs stay until 2019
LONDON AFP Dec2, Tottenham Hotspur's Jan Vertonghen has signed a new contract that is set to keep him at the north London side until 2019, it was announced Friday.
The Belgium central defender moved to White Hart Lane in July 2012 from Dutch side Ajax and has since become a mainstay of manager Mauricio Pochettino's team.
I was very happy once I put my autograph on the paper, Vertonghen told Spurs TV, the club's in-house broadcast channel.
I was extremely happy, big relief. I'm very happy to be here, the future looks great so I am very happy to be a part of it, added Vertonghen, who has so far made 179 appearances for Tottenham.
His partnership at the back with Toby Alderweireld last season fuelled Spurs' title challenge, with the club qualifying for the Champions after conceding just 35 Premier League goals -- the joint-lowest total in English football's top flight.
Vertonghen has followed the lead of several Spurs team-mates, including Harry Kane, Kyle Walker, Christian Eriksen, Eric Dier, Danny Rose and Dele Alli in extending his contract.
His decision came just 24 hours after Kane signed on with Spurs until 2022 and Vertonghen said: This is an unbelievable group of talented guys and I feel privileged to be a part of that.

PRIVATE BUS STRIKE LEAVES PUBLIC STRANDED
The strike by private buses and 21 threewheeler unions around the country left the public stranded at deserted bus stops and depots yesterday.
The protest against the increase in fine to Rs.25,000 for seven traffic offences includes driving without a license, drunk driving and speeding.
Railway Unions and the Sri Lanka Private Bus Owners Associations (SLPBOA) held discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena on Thursday night with both unions promising to call off the strike but the next day, the private buses defied SLPBOA Chairman Gemunu Wijerathna go ahead with the strike.
Three wheeler drivers yesterday held a massive protest at Lotus Road demanding the government to stop increasing the fine to Rs. 25,000 for several traffic offences. Picture by Wimal Karunathilake
Wijerathna was not available for comment despite several attempts to contact him.
The government in response has increased the number of Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) buses operating on the roads.
SLTB Chairman Ramal Siriwardena speaking to the Daily News said
As soon as I heard of the possible strike, I released a circular cancelling all leave and calling back all to report to duty. We are constantly monitoring the situation and while we cant guarantee that there is no inconvenience caused, we are trying to minimize disruptions,he said.
According to him, the SLTB has increased the number of buses deployed from 5,300 to 6,100 by using some of the long distance buses for short distance transport.
Despite such efforts however, the SLTB was falling short of the demand as the majority of transport in the country is run by private buses,Either way, we only run 1,000 buses while there are 4000 private buses,the SLTB Chairman said.
The protest also took a violent turn yesterday as protestors started to pelt stones at SLTB buses which were operating during the strike.
According to news reports, close to 20 buses were damaged. Two school children were injured due to the pelting of stones but we have asked for police protection at all bus depots,Siriwardena said.
Transport Ministry Secretary Nihal Somaweera speaking to the Daily News said the demands of the unions were unjustifiable.
We have had several discussions with them up to Thursday but they will have to respect rules. The SLTB is operating in full swing and we have made arrangements to have them running so in the next couple of days too,he said. He added that despite union warnings to continue the strike indefinitely, it was not likely to continue given the losses to their income they would face each day.
The Lotus Road Roundabout at Fort was closed off yesterday due to around 1,000 thre wheelers from 21 unions being parked on the road. They also blocked the main Colombo-Negombo main road causing severe congestion.
They are now asking us to not overtake from the left, and then there is also a rule that we cannot overtake from the right. How will we overtake cars and get to our destination sooner This is what our passengers expect from us,Pradeep Kumara from the Thotalanga Threewheeler Drivers
Association who had parked his vehicle at Lotus Road said.
He added that it was unfair to increase the fine for speeding as they had no option but to speed. Ajim who is also a three wheel driver from the Thotalanga stand said these problems were due to a lack of national policy with regard to the Three wheeler industry,
An unidentified group in Yakkala pelted stones at a CTB bus plying from Kalmunai to Colombo damaging its windscreen. No passengers were injured.
Picture by Gampaha Additional Corr. 
We know that overtaking from the left is wrong but then at least let us overtake from the right. When buses were asked not to overtake from the right, Gemunu went on strike and got private buses exempted. This is unfair,Ajim said.
The three wheel drivers were insistent that they would continue to strike until their demands are met.
Military Spokesperson, Brigadier Roshan Seneviratne said the Defence Ministry Secretary through the Office of Chief of Defence Staff, requested that the military remain on standby in the case where police would require any assistance to control the situation. The new fine system however will only come into effect once the necessary amendments to the Motor Traffic Act are made. In addition, the Attorney General and Parliament would need to approve of the new structure.
Meanwhile, employees in several government institutes were allowed to leave an hour and a half early yesterday due to the private bus and three wheel drivers strike yesterday.
The courts, public administration, urban development authority and several other ministries followed suit.
It was also reported that attendance in schools and other private institutes were also greatly reduced due to the strike.
Meanwhile, two SLTB buses were damaged on Thursday and Wednesday as stones were pelted at them at two separate locations in the Trincomalee area, said the police.
The first attack was on the bus from Trincomalee to Tangalle on Wednesday night with the front most window on the left broken but no passengers were hurt, Police sources said.
The second attack was on a bus at the Trincomalee Marathadiya junction yesterday morning. A side mirror was broken. The attack was launched when the bus which had travelled from Colombo to Trincomalee was on its way back. The Trincomalee police believe that both attacks were carried out by the same group.
Thousands were stranded due to the private bus operators trade union action. Here, youths playingcricket at the private bus stand in Pettah sans buses.Picture by Wimal Karunathilake
