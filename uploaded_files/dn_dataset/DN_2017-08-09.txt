Anti-IS operations enter fourth year
US: The US-led coalition campaign to destroy the Islamic State (IS) group in Iraq and Syria enters its fourth year this week, and the Pentagon believes the jihadists defeat is inevitable.
On August 8, 2014 two FA-18 jets launched from the USS George W. Bush aircraft carrier in the Gulf and dropped 500-pound laser-guided bombs on IS fighters near Arbil in northern Iraq.
The action marked the beginning of an intense aerial bombardment that was later augmented by the training and equipping of local forces to fight IS, first in Iraq and then in Syria.
IS burst into the limelight earlier in 2014 as it swept across northern Iraq and Syria, seizing major cities including Mosul and Raqa, and leaving a trail of slaughter and barbarity in its wake. At the height of its advance, IS held about 40,000 square miles (104,000 square kilometers) of territory and even threatened Baghdad, with many Iraqi military units collapsing in disarray as the jihadists approached.
They had eight million people who were being ruthlessly held captive by their rule and living in misery, many forced into refugee status and depravity, Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis said.
In the three years since the campaign began, 70 percent of the territory IS once held in Iraq has been recaptured, and 50 percent in Syria.
Not one inch of that territory that we have liberated has been retaken by ISIS, Davis said.
ISIS is facing its inevitable defeat. We will win and they will lose. The US-led coalition comprises 69 countries, though only a handful of these partners are participating in the air campaign or training missions.
Even though experts foresee the eventual collapse of ISs self-declared caliphate, the jihadists have fought back by calling on followers to launch terror attacks across the globe.
As of July 26, 2017, the coalition had conducted 13,221 strikes in Iraq, and 10,701 strikes in Syria, for a total of 23,922 strikes at a daily cost averaging $13.6 million.
The fight against IS has seen constant bombing sorties, often in urban areas.
The coalition has acknowledged killing 624 civilians to date, though observers say the real number is much higher.
While this is the most precise campaign in the history of warfare, civilians do die in war and thats the sad truth, Davis said.- AFP

## Title: ATAPATTU from zeroes to hero

ATAPATTU from zeroes to hero
MARVAN SAMSON ATAPATTU was a renowned willow wielder, leader and captain par excellence. His cricketing career was a fabled story of one who from a run of zeroes ended hero.
Born on November 22, 1970 and hailing from Kalutara, ATAPATTU was a star to behold as an opening batsman. His motoring skills were used to steer the ball to any part of the field with feline grace and electric power.
Generally south paws are acknowledged as the most stylish, but ATAPATTU a right handed batsman knocked that belief into a cocked hat, as he watched and followed the ball leave the bowlers hand, got it to make contact with the bat, and with rare world timing directed the ball stylishly all over the field or over it using the bat like a wand like a magician would do.
Showed inborn talent
As a teenager from the time he held a bat in school, he showed inborn natural talent and had a style that was revealing to his coaches who had only a little chiseling to do to shape him into a batsman of the classical mould which shape and style he maintained throughout his glittering career.
ATAPATTU first served notice of his immense skills at Mahinda College, Galle where his first coach Major G.W.S. de Silva was amazed at his talent. His talents did not go unnoticed and he soon took wing to Colombo and Ananda College.
He came under the eagle eyed and talented coach P.W. Perera who further enhanced his talents, showed him how and put him on the highway to success locally and internationally.
Scintillating century
I was witness to a scintillating century he scored against my school St.Benedicts College on the turf at Kotahena. I watched in awe his all round stroke play, his polished footwork and timing-- which batting is all about-- as he with supreme grace notched that three figure score. With that he announced his arrival to the Country's cricketing portals. . And he underlined that belief as his career grew in stature.
At Ananda College he scored bagsful of runs in inter-school cricket and then threw in his lot with the Sinhalese Sports Club where his run glut continued. The Sri Lankan selectors of that time did not take long to plonk him into the Sri Lanka squad as a 20-year old.
But his baptism in big time cricket was a calamity. In his first six innings for the country he made five zeros and then a single which critics believe was an extra as the ball had not made contact with the bat! In that era the umpires word was law and so the scorer recorded it as a run.
Baying for his blood
What is vivid in my memory is this. Critics were baying for his blood for his repeated failures and I was one of them being the cricket writer in the Daily Mirror and Times of Ceylon. When I happened to run into the then batting sensation the right handed Aravinda de Silva, he knowing my cricketing background asked me to hold my fire and not demoralize and destroy the youngster and that it would not be long before he made waves. And de Silvas prediction did not take long to realize. ATAPATTU became a HERO from zero. The rise was phenomenal.
It must be recalled that great world batsmen had opened their careers that were to glitter later with ducks. In that bracket hung the names of Sir Leonard Hutton, Graham Gooch and present day TV Commentator Mike Atherton who all later went on to captain England.
Repertoire of strokes
While he had the ability with a repertoire of strokes, but what was excellent and eye catching was when he played the square cuts and the cover and on drives. He made his Test debut in 1990 fronting up to India and played his final Test in 2007 against Australia. ODI debut was in 1990 against India and his last ODI was also against India in 2007.
The dream of captaining the country came to AtAPATTU in 2003. He proved a clever thinking captain and won games. He had to prematurely give up the captaincy when he picked up a recurring painful back injury which continued to trouble him.
ATAPATTU proved an able opening partner with the dashing Sanath Jayasuriya. The stylish right hander scored one of his best centuries when he made a memorable 185 against England in the holy land of cricket Lords when he opened with Jayasuriya.
Same opposition
Before that knock he scored 201 against the same opposition in a Galle Test. He kept Jayasuriya company as opener when the pair put on a stand of 335 against Pakistan in Kandy. He made an unbeaten 207 while Jayasuriya who led the team made 188. He later had many double hundreds.
ATAPATTU was a clever leader of men and his team mates had the highest respect and regard for him. After retirement he turned his attention to coaching and coached Canada for a short period in 2009. He was head coach of Singapore for 12 months.
After the 2011 World Cup ATAPATTU was asked to be the batting coach of the Sri Lanka team and supported Australian Stuart Law who was the interim coach, bowling coach Champaka Ramanayake and fielding coach Ruwan Kalpage on the tour of England.
Coaching abilities
ATAPATTUs coaching abilities did not go unnoticed and he was appointed Interim head coach in 2014. During his tenure Sri Lanka won its First Test series in England in 16 years with a 1-0 win. The official head coach title was not long in coming and it did come in 2014. But unfortunately after Test series loses to Pakistan and India, ATAPATTU threw in the towel and gracefully resigned in 2015.
But as always been the case, when the team loses it is the captain and the coach who have their necks on the block. But when the team wins all get the credit. It was no different with ATAPATTU being blamed for the defeats and not wanting to be further scourged he quit.

Bond commission : We buy the rumour and sell the news
Explaining the dynamics of Perpetual Treasuries trading in the market, PTL Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena yesterday said the Treasury Bond Commission that We (PTL) buy the rumours (in the market) and sell the news, whereas others wait to buy after the news.
Palisena also said that he is able to pinpointedly predict government requirements up until 2045, if accurate details are available to him. He was testifying before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue yesterday.
PTL lawyer Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando led evidence.
Fernando PC asked Palisena if it is possible for him to predict the government requirement for March 2018, to which Palisena replied in the affirmative. He said he would provide the commission with the details tomorrow.
According to data provided by the Central Bank, which are in the public domain, we know that the government needs to pay for Rs 92.2 billion worth bonds plus their coupon rates by March 2018. So, altogether in March 2018, the government has to pay approximately Rs125 billion. Palisena said.
If the government does not raise money in any other manner or receive large investments or foreign aid, then we know for sure that the government needs this amount of money in a particular month. If one or more above mentioned have taken place, we can adjust our predictions accordingly. Palisena explained.
Palisena, wording the aggressive approach followed by the PTL in the Treasury bond market told the PCoI that they look into maturities of Treasury bonds, Treasury bills, Sri Lanka Development Bonds and sovereign bonds as tools to make such predictions.
He also said the PTL financial analysts comb through the hints given to the money market through financial magazines and other informative websites both local and foreign, on a daily basis. We derive information from websites belonging to IMF, World Bank, Asian Development Bank, Reserve Bank of India and more. The information is available. It is only a matter of looking for them. Palisena said.
For example, Palisena said on February 18, 2015, Reserve Bank of India issued a one year one billion Treasury bonds to a weighted average cut off of 8.03676 where as on the same date Sri Lanka was trading a 10 year 1 billion bond at an 8.10 weighted average yield rate.
Palisena explained that when the math is properly done, they were able to predict that a 10 year Treasury bond will be closer to a 11.00 rate. If our prediction to be wrong, either Indias rate has to go down or Sri Lankas rate has to go up.
PTL CEO Palisena also said that there are pioneers, followers and laggards in the market and that PTL was scrupulously working to become a pioneer in the market. Commissioner Justice P.S. Jayawardena wondered where we can place Employees Provident Fund. In between the three categories, pointed out Palisena.
Manipulated market rates
Palisena continuing his testimony told the Treasury Bond Commission that prior to 2015, both money market and the share market rates were artificially manipulated by parties who intervene the natural changes to these markets.
Palisena said, by the end of 2014 when the US Federal Reserve announced ending its quantitative easing (QE) stimulus programme which began in 2008, there was a 2.5 billion dollars worth capital outflow from the Sri Lankan share and money market. Of the Treasury bond market the capital outflow (simply meaning foreign investors in Sri Lankas bond market, leaves it) by the end of 2014, was 700 million dollars.
Following the US Federal Reserve ended the QE in September 2014, entire world yield rates picked up. Since Sri Lanka was an emerging market, the effect was higher to us. However, contrary to the usual, Sri Lanka controlled its exchange by intervention and controlled its yield rates through auctions. Our foreign reserves drop from 7.5 billion US dollars to a 2.5 billion dollars. By the end of 2014, we were at a balance payment deficit. Palisena explained.
The manipulated market got back to normal in February 2015, when the present government approached the International Monetary Fund and requested for a three year extended fund facility, Palisena further explained.
At the initial stage of his testimony, Palisena gave evidence on the business plan of the Perpetual Treasuries Limited which received its license as a Primary Dealer in 2013.
From the beginning, PTL addressed the need to invest in long term bonds, Palisena said. He said that PTL envisioned longer tenure bonds as an answer to stop the bunching effect (a large volume of Treasury bonds maturing on a same day, making it challenging to the government to pay all at once.)
Palisena pointed out Sri Lanka will have to face the biggest bunching of all history in the coming 2018 and 2019. Previous evidence led at the PCoI revealed that Sri Lanka will have to bear the brunt with the bunching of large dollar repayments for the international sovereign bonds which have been issued in years 2007 up until 2015.
While going through the PTLs SWOT analysis included in its business plan, Commissioner Justice Jayawardena asked Palisena to describe what PTL meant by (it) will promote secondary market in government securities using different techniques used in the equity market
Commissioner Jayawardena requested Palisena to be specific on the said different techniques used in the equity market, and referred to the Stock Market fiasco in 2012.
Justice Jayawardena then asked as to who was dealing in the equity market representing Perpetual Asset Management and Perpetual Capital Holdings. Palisena said that would be Arjun Aloysius and Suren Muthuraja.
Did you know what happened in the share market in 2012 Justice Jayawardena questioned Palisena. Yes, I know. Palisena replied.
Justice Jayawardena then asked if the term different techniques used in the equity market mean that the same tools used in the share market in and around 2012, will be used by the PTL in the government securities market as well. A clear answer was not provided by Palisena.
Justice Jayawardena pointed out that allegations came out in 2012 about the techniques used in the share market by Perpetual Asset Management and several other companies.
Palisena was also questioned by Nihal Fernando PC on the PTLs rapid profits from its establishment upto 2014.
We started with a capital of Rs 300 million in the company. By September 31,2014, our capital gain rose to Rs. 816 million. 85% of our trading was seven or more year long term bonds. Rs. 567 million of the 816, was by trading. Capital of the PTL by the same date was Rs 1.40 billion. It is a 400% increase of the initial capital the company had, Palisena told the PCoI. Justice Jayawardena asked Palisena whether between the beginning of 2014 to beginning of 2015, former Central Bank Governor Ajit Nivard Cabraals sister Shiromi Wickremesinghe was a director of the PTL. Palisena answered in affirmative. Previous evidence led at the PCoI has pointed out that the relationship of Nivard Cabraal and his sister who is in the director board of a primary dealer is a conflict of interest.
Palisena pointed out to the PCoI that of 276 transactions done by the PTL in the bond market, only Rs. 2.5 billion was raised through direct placements.He highlighted that PTL was not an active player when the direct placement method was used at Treasury bond auctions. He also said PTL did not maintain an Investment Book where as it maintained a Trading Book.
According to evidence led at the PCoI yesterday, Palisena has chosen his staff by both advertising and head hunting. His PTL key staff members in 2013, included V. Jesudasan, Nuwan Salgado, Harin Nishanta, Nadeeka Jayasekara, Manju Priyadarshana, Upeka Samarasinghe and Nishanti Udawatta. These officers have five or more experience working for primary dealers and money brokers such as Aquity Securities, CIC Group, Capital Alliance and Natwealth Group.
Where is Mr. Gajan Justice Jayawardena asked Palisena. Gajan Devarajan is the PTL Financial Analyst who attends commission proceedings daily and usually sits at the back row seats allocated for the public.
Gajan came in 2016 as a dealer and our Financial Analyst. Palisena explained.
I see Mr. Gajan every day, so was interested in getting to know him. Justice Jayawardena said. He also went on to ask where is Muththu, who was your best man at your wedding. Palisena told that he is working for another company.
Bit of Entertainment
While technical lingo dominated the proceedings, it was entertaining when a Sinhala proverb breezed in when DSG Milinda Gunatilake reserved his rights to question PTL Financial Analyst Gajan Devarajan, since he has prepared most of the documents submitted by Palisena.
Translating the proverb, Fernando PC said this is like getting into your swimming suit way before the sea comes anywhere near vicinity to which Justice Jayawardena promptly said That is exactly what I meant when I said Muhuda Hathgawuwak thibeth di (wording of the original proverb in Sinhala).
DSG Gunatilake came back with a reply saying that it (proverb) should be applicable to PTL for bringing in Mr. Gajan to the hearing from the beginning of the PCoI.
Palisena will testify before the PCoI today as well.

Chulodhara wins top 50 professional, career women gold awards for best CEO Leadership
Sri Lankas foremost and pioneering herbal personal care product manufacturer Swadeshi Industrial Works PLCs Deputy Chairperson and Managing Director Deshamanya Chulodhara Samarasinghe was bestowed with the Best CEO and Leadership Gold award at the Top 50 Professional and Career Women Awards, seventh edition.
The annual event is organised by Women in Management (WIM) partnering with International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of World Bank Group.
The event recognizes and honours women in the national and regional economy taking into account their professional achievements, experience, creativity and value additions by them to respective institutions by overcoming challenges and seizing opportunities.
The award ceremony was held on July 14 at Taj Samudra hotel was graced by the Ministers, Diplomats and Professionals in Business and Government sectors.
The theme of the 2017 edition was; Beyond parity  Developing tomorrow's Women Leaders'. The highly prestigious accolade conferred upon Chulodhara thus was a fitting tribute towards her potency in managing both her professional and personal lives with equal tranquility and right spirit.
Chulodhara has an illustrious professional career. Joining Maritime holdings, Hayleys PLC in 1995 as a Management Trainee had been her initial move towards consolidating herself as a professional in the corporate sector. By handling a large base of clients in the imports and exports sectors and logistics elevated herself to the post of an assistant manager within a short spell.
Since 1999 to date Chulodara has used her managerial prowess to add value to Swadeshi Industrial Works PLC as the Commercial Director, Managing Director and the Deputy Chairperson/Managing Director (present designation). She spearheads a team of over 400 employees.
Todays managers should be uber-proactive to add value to their companies. Stiff competition prevailing in the corporate sector pose us with both challenges and golden opportunities and we as managers should have the forecasting prowess to keep challenges at bay and seize opportunities to drive our companies towards greater heights, These have been challenging times but with a never give up attitude and support received from my team at Swadeshi and other important colleagues gives me greater self satisfaction and courage to move forward taking Swadeshi to greater heights in the future. said Chulodhara.
I intend to take Swadeshi brands to new heights with a focus on overseas markets and introduce more natural skin care herbal therapy products from Sri Lanka to the Swadeshi product portfolio.
I also have a passion towards educating future generations on the value and importance of life and compassion for all beings including animals. To have my own sanctuary for rescued animals is something that tops my wish list, said a contented Chulodhara.

A new voting system required
At present the voting system in elections (General, Provincial etc) is called Proportional Representation System (PRS) on District basis.
Since there is fair amount of dissatisfaction amongst the public at large, a mixture of two systems was suggested.
a) Proportional Representation System (PRS)  District basis
b) First Post the Past System (FPPS)  Electoral basis
It is reported that  CAFFE (Campaign for Fair and Free Elections) had recommended.
PRS  75%
FPPS  25%
No preference allocation (Provincial and National List)
This has been changed now and a bill has been submitted to the Parliament this month for approval.
PRS  40%
FPPS  60%
Women allocation 25% (Minimum)
No preference allocation.
Since the Local Government Election would be held in January 2018, (only 6 months to go). Voters should be educated on the benefits of the new system and the method of voting as well. Regrettably, even after 69 years of freedom, our people have not been properly educated to exercise their voting rights and also on the importance of voting. Low voting rate, high percentage of rejected votes (even willfully done at times) shows this.
This happens even in Districts where literacy level is very high. Several educated people do not actively participate in voting.
It should be noted that when voting was introduced it was suggested that only literates should have the right to vote. Our leftist leaders fought for and secured the National Franchise. We must realize this, and be thankful to them.
It is the duty of our political leaders, intellectuals, professionals, trade chambers, unions etc to elucidate the position to the public regards voting.
We are blessed with a powerful media who can play a major role in this regard. Seminars, discussions, interviews etc should be arranged for the benefit of the Nation.

Constitutional Assembly: Withdrawal of NFF parliamentarians has zero impact

The withdrawal of five National Freedom Front (NFF) Parliamentarians led by MP Wimal Weerawansa has zero impact on the legality and proceedings of the Constitutional Assembly (CA), Speaker Karu Jayasuriya announced in Parliament today.
MP Weerawansa asked the Speakers position over the letter submitted to the latter late last month informing the withdrawal of NFF from the Assembly.
In our letter, we stated that the CA would no longer be valid with our withdrawal, because the resolution adopted in Parliament states that the CA consists of all 225 members. We would like to hear the Speakers opinion on this matter, Weerawansa said.
The Speaker observed the NFF pulling out of CA has not given rise to any problem. I obtained legal advice before coming in to this conclusion, he added.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella observed that all 225 MPs need not necessarily take part in CA sittings. If there is quorum, the CA can go ahead with its work, Kiriella said. 
The CA was formed following a resolution passed unanimously in Parliament in March last year to formulate a new Constitution. It has so far conducted four sittings.

Credentials for champions
We need to strive to meet the strategic demands of higher education in Sri Lanka deviating from its conventional approach into globally demanding disciplines, while accelerating the development of such initiative and to make greater contributions for a flourishing country and a powerful nation, a harmonious society and a people of well-being.
In the modern world, sport has become extremely big business. From the multi-billion dollar elite world of professional sport to the equally significant personal fitness sector, the impact of sport on both individual lives and the global economy cannot be understated. As long as civilization has existed, weve looked for ways to increase sports performance, raise levels of physical fitness and well-being, reduce the risk of injury, speed up recovery, and bring communities together through this shared celebration of the human body and its capabilities.
Sports science careers range from roles in sports management and marketing through to personal training, physiotherapy and nutritional consultancy. A sports science degree could provide the professional knowledge and training you need in life.
A relatively young discipline, gaining popularity in the last quarter of the 20th century, sports science reflects the seriousness with which sports and fitness are approached today. This is a relatively multi-disciplinary subject, drawing on fields such as physiology and bio-mechanics to measure what is happening in a sportspersons body; psychology to analyze the role of the mind in performance; nutrition to help athletes fuel their bodies correctly; and business and sports management to understand the financial and operational sides of the sports industry.
Popular sport universities
Countries such as China has paid more attention and endeavour on sport industry in recent years. Such countries showed the achievements and their determination to develop sports and make people healthier than before. So far China, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Newzealand has established sports universities and students from sport universities usually become athletes, coaches and teachers in China. Some popular sport universities are: Tianjin University of Sport, Nanjing Institute of Physical education, University of Toronto, Canada, Loughborough sporting university, University of Birmingham United Kingdom etc. In these universities prospective sporting students will receive an education as noteworthy for its theoretical focus as for its practical. Sporting Universities are the background to much great British sporting history, from Roger Bannisters four-minute mile at Oxfords Iffley Road track to Sebastian Coes Olympic gold medals, won after years of training at Loughborough. In such universities, athletes have benefit of training equipment, a running track as well as bio-mechanics laboratories.
They are finally become managers, teachers, administrators, entrepreneurs, coaches, healthcare providers, and researchers and they are all about sports, at the professional, Olympic, collegiate, interscholastic, and recreational levels.
The United States Sports Academy was the first and is the only one of its kind in the United States. It was established in 1972 to turn around a new scientific finding that linked poor preparation of coaches to the injuries incurred by the athletes they supervised. Today, coaches everywhere can prepare thoroughly for their work. Through sports-focused instruction, support of research, and teamwork with professional groups and the Academy showed how to meet sports professionals educational needs.
Research in sports
Through their research arm, United States Sports Academy has developed a physical fitness test battery that has been used to assess the very young to the very old. The Academy has also undertaken a variety of special studies to help governments and policymakers chart a course for their national sport efforts. A United States Sports Academy faculty member who has conducted scholarly research on e-sports is predicting continued global growth for the popular competitive video gaming tournaments.
At present we merely go after teaching conventional disciplines in universities. There is only few departments have developed in sport sciences in Sri Lankan universities. We cannot see students from such departments become athletes, coaches and teachers. Talented coaches referees could be cradled in a more organised manner under the concept of Sports University. Sri Lanka does not utilize the resources of many passionate dedicated sportsmen and women properly.
There is a necessity of developing sport facilities in universities. Professionalization of sports is also feeding into traditional university games globally. Hence, we need a dedicated mission to strengthen health, advocating sportsmanship and pursuing excellence. Our country is enriched with talents. What is lacking is commitment towards a change. Worldwide top scholars, teachers, athletes, coaches have developed globally through such universities. We need to understand the social responsibility linked with sports in the current context while developing general administration in sports in Sri Lankan higher education.
We need not to depend on general treasury; rather we could establish such initiative through public private partnership. We are lagging far behind and our youthful strength and capabilities are wasting on the roads.
There is a necessity of establishing a university aims to educate and nurture excellent sportsmen and specialized sports coaches in Sri Lanka. It may be a tedious task to be fulfilled as a country with many other issues. The importance of the physical education is important from the early childhood. China, Japan, USA, Taiwan, South Korea provides best examples in physical education. The successive governments in those countries have a vision for their future generation, to nurture them and to build a confident healthy nation. At present our higher education system does not provide adequate attention to physical education since the vision for physical education is questionable in Sri Lanka. Attempts made to build a Sports University in different eras in Sri Lanka failed due to lack of commitment and lack of a vision.
The sports university could have areas of physical education, sport coaching, community sport, sport science, traditional Sri Lankan sport such as Angampora, sport and industry management, applied psychology, sport rehabilitation and leisure sport etc.
Students who wish to pursue in physical education need to be provided with a key platform for student-staff exchanges and distance education between Sri Lanka and the rest of the world and need to be established academic exchange relationships in physical education. This could be categorised into different types of sports such as cricket, rugby, swimming, basketball etc. This opportunity provides admitting from the widest possible pool of talented students in Sri Lanka.
Having considered the global scenario of higher education timely measures are needed to establish a sports university. Ministry of Sports and Ministry of Higher Education could workout the plans for our future generation. May be it takes time to reap the benefits, but it is the high time to plant the seed.

Drought adversely affecting fishing industry: Amaraweera

The freshwater fisheries industry of the country has been badly affected due to the severe drought condition prevailing in most parts of the island, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
According to the minister, small reservoirs in several areas have been completely evaporated and fish resources of these reservoirs have been completely destroyed and the Fisheries Ministry will take measures to release fresh stocks of fish once the reservoirs filled with water.
Apart from that the Ministry has already taken measures to provide technical and financial assistance to promote inland fish farming among the families whose income is based on fishing at small reservoirs since the fish catch of them has been drastically declined, said the Minister.
He further said that the government had allocated a large amount of funds for the development of inland fisheries industry of the country. The monthly income of families those who depend on fresh water fish industry had been increased up to Rs 100,000 due to the welfare activities and livelihood development programmes conducted during past two years.
Due to the non-establishment of new fish hatcheries during the previous regime, only 20 million fresh stocks of fish released to the reservoirs. But now the number of fish annually release to the reservoirs has been increased up to 80 million. A large number of fish hatcheries have already been established in the country with the intention of releasing 100 million fish to the reservoirs by the end of year 2019. the Minister added.

EAGLE EGGS
Short story:
Father, father, wake up, wake up! The sky is blue. Its the voice of the eaglet, the first child of the third generation of the Pathirage lineage. Pathirages are well-respected and the most educated in the vicinity of Boralukada, a bucolic hamlet in the south of Sri Lanka. Yet, the voice was heard in a faraway clime, Brisbane in Australia, the country of the aborigines. It is said that the VEDDHAS in Sri Lanka and the ABORIGINES in Australia have similar dispositions.
Thisara and Amalka left for Australia nearly after six months of their nuptial ceremony. Thisara is the second son of the school teacher couple, Wansa and Indrani. The newly wedded couple made their nest in Everton Park on Bullers lane as Amalkas husband had to read for his doctorate in civil engineering at a prestigious university there.
Thisara being gifted with ultra-active intelligence and imagination not only in the spheres of academic pursuits but also in mundane life left no stone unturned to make their conjugal life a resounding success. His spouse plays no second fiddle to him and she was able to join a child caring institute in the locality adjacent to their dwelling on account of her good command of the Queens lingo and her sagacity.
Himath Keshawa, fondly called by all near and dear ones HIMA is the eaglet, the third generation child of the Pathirage pedigree. He is the father like son and in every childhood feat he shows hidden genius and his cute behaviour is constantly promoted by his keen mother, Amalka.
It was the homecoming celebration of the above couple and the huge gathering in the spacious compound tells the tale of the social standing of the Pathirage family. Almost all, the rich and the poor had been invited to the maiden wedding ceremony of the family of four sons whose mother had left them in a tragic accident.
The eldest son being a doctor, Thisara a reputed young engineer, the third in the row Chamara a charted accountant and the youngest Isuru being a first year engineering student at the University of Moratuwa, the invitees to the grand occasion were a mixed crowd. All were mingling freely and their father Wansa, in high spirits, moderately intoxicated took some of us to very strange sight.
It was veritably very strange we could find a huge eagle protecting four eagle eggs. All were very inquisitive to know the untold history in cement and Wansa told us that he had protected his four motherless children like a mother eagle protecting her eggs.
The eagle is synonymous with keen eye sight. Everyone appreciated Wansa for bringing up his children after the untimely death of their beloved mother. The story did not end there, in our very presence; he took one of the four eggs and vanished.
As Amalkas father I have been trying my best to trace the place where my cousin had kept that eagle egg. He came out of his hiding place and told that the four eggs had symbolized four children and one was released to live his own life. Two years later another egg was removed in the same manner when Chamara, the third son was wedded to Sasika, a medical doctor.
HIMA is the eaglet, the third generation pride.

Echoes from Holocaust
The term Holocaust has always stirred my innermost feelings of existence. What does the term signify I was told by learned people that the term derives from Greek holokauston, literary means something burnt whole, a compound of holos or whole and kaustos, which is also the source of English caustic or through destruction especially by fire. What else are you in search of
My inner self questions.
The term Holocaust has given way to other terms such as genocide, extermination and extinction. I was in Wroclaw, Poland, at the time I was concentrating on Concentration Camps, where the Jews were brought by Nazi SS army officials in order to face the most dreadful and horror-filled punishment of facing the extermination. In Poland, I was under the UNESCO  Polish Government Copernicus Award for Social Sciences. I was anxious to visit a concentration camp left behind as a symbol of horror of the mankind of the yesteryear.
There was one Professor, attached to Lublin University, with who I frequently discussed not only the blessings of the existence but also the horrors which come as the alternative force. That was the moment where he suggested: Do you like to go with me to see Majdanek in Lublin
Genocide warrant
It is the earliest concentration camp set up only a few months after Hitlers rise to power.
So when can we go I asked Professor Tadeus Magul.
Any time convenient for you, he responded.
Tomorrow
Thats fine. Lets go during the early hours of the morning.
So we set forth. Professor Tadeus Magul knew quite a lot about the Holocaust. He handed over several texts of significance written in English like Norman Cohens celebrated book titled as Warrant for Genocide published in England in 1967 and later republished several times. I went on reading all the source material until the wee hours of the dawn.
We reached the entrance to the Madjaneck Concentration Camp, before noon. There were a few others. I saw the long barbed wire fence. Beside it was the culvert dug around. I stood amazed, seeing how silent the professor stood. He whispered in my ears. The words came one by one like a poem.
We got to adhere to silence. No noise. Respect the dead. This is that fence, which when touched by an intimate who wants to escape will be electrocuted instantly.
Speechless
I stood listening. No words came from me. I had nothing to ask. His explanation was simple.
When electrocuted, the body falls down into the culvert. Then the body is taken by a wheel barrow to the extermination camp. The shivering body, if the pulse is felt, is pushed into the shower room. It is called bathroom with a shower which showers the gas called Zyklon B (Cyclone B). Thats all. Lets go in. See for yourself how things have happened.
I came to know the story of Jews. They were called inmates or internees.
The living conditions included a rough place to sleep called barrack. The wooden barracks were named blocks. Early in the existence of the camp, the inmates or the prisoners brought from various places. They slept on the straw spread across the thin layers on the bare ground. Later when the barracks were fitted with floors, they were supplied with paper mattresses, filled with shavings and moldy straw. I came to know that all the inmates were numbered. Newcomers received the numbers left vacant.
We were walking together. But the difference was that Professor Tadeus Magul was silent. I was silent. The rare occasion was the whispering of facts, and the translation of some Polish lines written in some places.
Uniform
I came to know that the clothes given to the inmates hardly had any protection from cold and rain. Instead, penalties were incurred by those who wore scarves, sweaters or simply papers under the coats.
The uniform for women was a little different. They would be given skirts - not trousers or slacks - and white kerchiefs, to substitute for caps. The children in most cases kept their own clothing, as there were no small sized uniforms. As such they were mostly clad in pyjamas.
What did they eat The food was did not suffice the living conditions. They lacked protein, calcium and vitamins.
Hunger, I was told by my friend, was a continuous force. It was the reason for their debilitation as the pictures or photos show. It was also the reason for numerous illnesses. This resulted in psychological aberration like becoming angry and stealing food from fellow inmates. The human qualities gradually weakened to the point when inmates quarreled with each other.
For a moment I remembered the dear old diary of the charming Jew girl, Anne Frank. I felt that she has written her hidden notes to express her innermost feeling of this gruesome existence. Why did this all happen Anne seems to ask herself helplessly. Apart from hunger, dirt, insects, cold and little chance of ever getting enough rest and sleep.
Reduced to ashes
Then we walked towards the extermination unit. This, I felt, is the moment to reconsider the validity of our existence. Extermination was nothing but reducing the human body into ashes. The ashes were filled into a large tank like empty space. A vast land!
My mind flashed backed into endless limitless spaces created by humans to bury humans. For what reason For not agreeing to disagree
Then I saw a lady, tears flowing down her cheeks, holding a red flower in her hands. She was silently contemplating on something pensive and moody. Murmuring perhaps a prayer: I send you this red flower on thinking of how we lived together, loving each other. May this memento be a token of memory of how the humans should love each other!
Then I saw Professor Magul too holding a red flower in his hand.
There may be a relation of ours buried in this mound of ashes who knows what befalls us.
I too followed suit. True enough that I am a Sri Lankan come to see all this. But who knows whether a relation of mine too is reduced to ashes here Is this the Holocaust

Englands Ali hails Saqlain role in South Africa success
MANCHESTER: Moeen Ali has paid tribute to the amazing Saqlain Mushtag for his role in helping the England all-rounder enjoy a record-breaking Test series against South Africa.
Ali, a 30-year-old off-spinner and left-handed batsman, became the first man in cricket history to score more than 250 runs and take 25 wickets in a four-match Test series during the course of Englands 3-1 victory over the Proteas.
Ali has often been regarded, even by himself, as a second spinner when the likes of Hampshire left-armer Liam Dawson have been in the England side.
But under the guidance of England spin-bowling coach Saqlain, a former Pakistan off-spinner and star of a Surrey side that won English County Championship titles at the turn of the century, Alis bowling has improved markedly.
Saqqy has been amazing for me in terms of helping with my fields, helping me understand my bowling a lot more than I had done previously -- and I think that has been the biggest difference, said Ali after bowling England to a 177-run win in the fourth Test at Old Trafford with more than a day to spare on Monday.
Little things like that can make a big difference, explained Ali, who ended the match with two wickets in two balls for an innings return of five for 69 after finishing Englands victory in the third Test at The Oval with a hat-trick.

The ICT industry also has the potential to provide the highest employment to youth of Sri Lanka in the coming years with its high growth rate, and is able add up to 95% direct value additions in foreign earnings back to Sri Lanka.
This revenue is easily retained in Sri Lanka as the industry itself does not incur material import costs or high capital expenses. It is also one of the key industries that promotes entrepreneurship as it provides an opportunity for anyone with a brilliant idea and perseverance to create a solution, and achieve financial success with limited capital.
The MoU between FITIS and SLASSCOM will be a milestone that will be remembered in the times to come.
This is the first step towards elevating the ICT industry of Sri Lanka towards much higher levels of success while contributing to the transformation of Sri Lankan economy through digitization, said Dr. Kithsiri Manchanayakke, Chairman FITIS.
Ruwindhu Peiris, Chairman, SLASSCOM said, SLASSCOM can boast of many members who are globally renowned for their product innovations and services.
It is encouraging that the technical skills and best practices which have designed and built innovative, disruptive products for global clients can now be harnessed to do the same in local implementations for similar businesses. Dr. Kithsiri Manchanayake, Chairman of FITIS noted that the MoU will be a natural progression for companies that are a part of FITIS currently.
FITIS has many companies that have established themselves locally and has the potential to expand to overseas markets. To this end we feel SLASSCOM will be a huge asset as they have years of experience operating in overseas markets and export Sri Lankan technological solutions, he added.
Through the MoU, FITIS and SLASSCOM will collaborate in hosting events, contribute to add value to events held by each organization and to work towards presenting a unified voice representing the ICT, knowledge services and innovation sector.
The MoU will be the first of many initiatives by both organizations in the effort to contribute towards digitization of Sri Lankan economy.
FITIS and SLASSCOM also expects to bring the worlds top most renowned companies to Sri Lanka, in an effort to garner more recognition towards the ICT industry of Sri Lanka and to use the presence of such companies to add momentum to an industry emerging as a key pillar in Sri Lankan economy.

Forty Malaysian youths to be deployed to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh under MyCorps volunteer mission

A total of 40 youths have made the cut to be deployed to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh on a volunteer mission under the [emailprotected] Asia programme.
The 40, comprising 15 men and 25 women, aged between 18 and 30, from different cultures and backgrounds, were selected out of 483 applicants, by the Youth and Sports Ministry.
MyCorps is a volunteering programme that aims to shape self and identity values in Malaysian youths through experiences, contributions and duties in helping others.
Volunteers had to undergo a filtering process and interviews before they can proceed to an intensive pre-departure training. The month-long training started on July 15 and will end on Aug 13 before volunteers are flown out to the respective countries on Aug 15.
The volunteers were full of excitement and enthusiasm during the MyCorps participants meet-and-greet at the International Youth Centre today.
Muhammad Asyraf Fitri, 24, a volunteer from Perak who will be sent to Sri Lanka, said he is looking forward to helping the locals reconstruct their society.
Due to a recent civil war, I want to focus on the wellbeing and development of the locals in Sri Lanka, he said.
Asyraf said the programme has taught him the value of being selfless. He expressed his gratitude at being given the chance to serve the country.
Another volunteer, Chan Quan, from Sabah said that he is thankful for this once-in-a-lifetime experience to give back to the community.
I was overwhelmed with emotion when I found out I was chosen as one of the volunteers; I could not believe my eyes when I saw my name on the list, he said.
The 18-year-old, who will be helping Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, said he learned many things about humanitarian and volunteer work throughout the four weeks of pre-departure training.
I want to empower the youth to provide a helping hand for society and share our love with others, he added.
Sathiyakumari Poongawanam, who will be going to Sri Lanka, said she is proud and honoured to uphold Malaysias name while conducting humanitarian work.
This is not about individual work but instead, team cooperation to make sure Malaysia is known for our volunteer work.
I will be celebrating our National Day in a foreign country but my heart will always be with the Malaysians, said the 26-year-old, who is also a radio announcer at RTMs Minnal FM said.
Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin, who attended the event, said it is crucial to let the world know that Malaysia is here to lend a helping hand, hence the reason that the programme was established.
Through this programme, we are able to create a relationship and partnership with the government and NGOs in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, he said.
Khairy also urged volunteers to uphold the MyCorps motto, which is Changing Lives.
I want you (the volunteers) to not only change the lives of the people you help but also your own lives.
I do not want this mission to be the greatest thing you have done in your life but I want this to be the first greatest thing you did, he told the volunteers.

Beyond the Water Margin exhibition is held with the participation of four artists, representing four eras in Sri Lankan water colour art: Gunasiri Colambage, Basil Cooray, Sanjeewee Senevirathna and Nilusha Weerakkody. The four professional artists are exhibiting 80 paintings in the exhibition in four different styles and four themes. The exhibition will commence at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery on August 18 at 6 pm. It will be held on August 19, 20 and 21.
Art pieces are being created by the artists intellect, imagination, experiments, professional experience and consciousness, who indulge in creative work for their own independent and honest goals solely and collectively. That is not an unconcious copying by pouring some matter into a block. It is a broad, complicated and sensitive process. And it is not an artificial and impatient or a strained product. We believe that the ART is a social process of digesting of touching existing social and cultural mechanisms in a most authentic way by a community with a broad app reciation.
Beyond the Water Margin is a creative effort of a four water colour artists who united for the necessity of a collective creative approach and united by professionalism and self - satisfaction for the broadness of mutual understanding, the maturity of attitudes, collectiveness and the unity of diversity. It stands as a visual communication of satisfied self - expression as well.

Gastroenteritis outbreak at World Championships official team hotel
Athletes staying at one of the team hotels for the World Championships in London have gastroenteritis, event organisers have confirmed.
Botswanas Isaac Makwala, who is among the favourites for the 400m, withdrew from Mondays 200m heats after a reported bout of food poisoning.
Several German and Canadian athletes staying at the Tower Hotel fell ill last week.
A further 30 Germans due to arrive on Tuesday will be moved to other hotels.
German triple jumper Neele Eckhardt collapsed but was well enough to compete on Saturday, and took part in Mondays final.
A Local Organising Committee (LOC) statement said: There have been a number of cases of gastroenteritis reported by team members residing within one of the official team hotels for the World Championships.
Those affected have been supported by both team and LOC medical staff. In addition we have been working with Public Health England to ensure the situation is managed and contained.
As a result, further advice and guidelines have been issued to team doctors and support staff - standard procedure for such an occurrence where a number of teams are occupying championship accommodation.
The Tower Hotel said investigations conducted with environmental health officers and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) had shown the hotel was not the source of the illness.
It added: We have followed strict hygiene protocol, ensuring that those affected are not in contact with other guests and all public areas have been thoroughly sanitised.
Makwala, 30, was one of the favourites for the 200m and, without a valid reason for withdrawing, he could have been disqualified from the 400m.
It is unclear whether he will be able to race in the 400m final, which takes place on Tuesday (21:50 BST).
Makwala is considered to be the main challenger to Olympic champion and world record holder Wayde van Niekerk.
The IAAF said Makwala withdrew from the 200m due to a medical condition on the instruction of the IAAF medical delegate. BBC

Govt to retain large stake in restructured SriLankan
The government would definitely keep a large stake during the restructuring of SriLankan Airlines as the country needs a airline brand in the sky, said State Minister of Public Enterprise Development Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena.
Sri Lanka can only boost of its cricket, tea and tourism in the globe market and the country cannot afford to lose an international band such as SriLankan, he said.
Abeywardena voiced that SriLankan is very strong in its engineering, ground handling and catering areas and these functions should be retained by the government.
He said that all the airlines have been bleeding from airline passenger operations. Emirates suffered a 6%loss and Qatar losses were 9% but all of them have other related business like travel arms, hotels and this loss is not evident.
The minister said there are 7,000 employees and their interests too should be taken in to account and the right model for restricting is the private public partnership. When the loss making Malaysian Airlines was restricted and turned around there was a worker retrenchment. A similar thing cannot happen with SriLankan, the minister insisted.
He said that SriLankan is now on the right path trying to cover the loss making areas and the new destination to Australia in October seems to be a success. We have already sold over 10,000 seats, he said.
The minister also said that they would also look at the PPP model when it comes to the restructuring of the Mattala airport. It would not be done under similar terms of the Hambantota port deal.
Speaking at a special press conference to spell out the SLFP stance on the bond scam he said that the actual damage of it would amount to around Rs one trillion in 30 years. One must take in to account the loss suffered by the ETF and the investment opportunities where this money could have being diverted.

Harin calls for Presidential Commissions to probe corruption cases
Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando yesterday asked that President Sirisena appoint Presidential Commissions similar to that of the Treasury Bond Commission to speed up investigations into all cases of corruption.
Addressing a media briefing at the Government Information Department, the Minister admitted that there seemed to be certain shortcomings in the current law and order enforcement agencies to warrant such delays in prosecuting those charged with corruption.
We are having problems now because we have not been able to punish the real crooks after establishing a new government.
In 2015, when we came into power, people asked that we establish rule of law and freedom of speech, the latter is in full force now,Minister Fernando said.
A Presidential Commission will speed things up, explained the Minister further and added that it would be able to achieve what the FCID and other agencies couldnt thus far.
I also hope that the Attorney Generals Department would also pursue these cases with the same aggressiveness as they are with the Bond issue, he added.
His request, he said would be backed by other members in Cabinet which include Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne, State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene, Deputy Minister Ajith P.Perera and Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva.
When it comes to the No Confidence motion presented against his own Cabinet colleague, Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake however, Fernando said he would decide to support it or not, based on the findings of the Presidential Commission appointed to investigate into it.
The Minister also took the opportunity to address charges of corruption levelled against him. A Sinhala language daily had charged that the minister was allegedly involved in a Rs.800 million tender fraud at Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT).
I have nothing to do with SLT and have no power over their tender board. Its Executive Board that makes all the decisions, stressed the minister.
Fernando is expected to send a letter of demand to this newspaper over the story and alleged that it was a personal attack against him. He added that similar attacks were being launched at his fellow Cabinet members, namely; Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Minister Kabir Hashim and Minister Malik Samarawickrama.
The Minister who has voiced frequent displeasure over his role in government said, I feel that even when in government, I am not part of it. This is a conspiracy to silence those who speak out.
He added that due to the governments own delays in prosecuting the guilty, the thieves have begun to feel that they have got off scot free and were now targeting the government.
SLT General Manager (Access Service Assurance and Delivery) Lionel Imbulana explained that the SLT had decided to call for tenders for the sale of its unused copper cables according to accepted tender procedures.
The Minister has no authority over the tender process. We have Financial Committee, Senior and Junior Tender Boards and in the Senior, we have our Malaysian partners overseeing the process, Imbulana said.

Frenchman Renaud Lavillenie has never won a world gold -- he has a haul of four minor medals -- and his form this season suggests he is in danger of going without again. However the 30-year-old returns to the stadium where he won Olympic gold in 2012 and twice in the Diamond League. He looked in better shape in qualifying whilst others struggled. I love competing. I love fighting. And I think it is going to be very interesting, he said.
Mens 800 metres final
Robbed of a lot of its interest in the absence of the injured David Rudisha, it would seem set up for Botswanas Nijel Amos to go one better than he did back in 2012 in the Olympic final when his Kenyan rival broke the world record. The 23-year-old Commonwealth Games champions chances would appear further strengthened by the surprise failure of the previously unbeaten Emmanuel Korir to make the final. However, danger lurks in the shape of Polands 2015 silver medalist Adam Kszczot who beat him in the semi-final. The 2013 world champion Mohamed Aman of Ethiopia could also be a contender as well as young Kenyan Kipyegon Bett.
Womens Javelin final
China could be celebrating gold based on the qualifying round. Lyu Huihui may have saved her best form for when it counts as she set a new Asian record of 67.59 metres and even the 28-year-old 2015 silver medalist was surprised by her effort. Defending champion Kathrina Molitor of Germany -- who missed out on the Olympics last year -- also looked to be approaching medal winning form whilst Croatias Olympic title-holder Sara Kolak struggled to qualify.
Mens 3000m Steeplechase final
American Evan Jager will bid to break Kenyas monopoly on the event, runners from the east African powerhouse and Kenyan-born Qatari Saif Saaeed Shaheen (in 2003 and 2005) having won every edition of the steeplechase. Kenya swept the podium in Beijing two years ago and their line-up is again strong. Olympic champion Conseslus Kipruto and four-time world champion Ezekiel Kemboi will be two of a formidable outfit alongside the Ethiopian trio of Getnet Wale, Tafese Seboka and Chala Beyo, and three-time Olympic medallist and twice world medallist Mahiedine Mekhissi of France.
Mens 400m final
Wayde van Niekerk has his first shot of a medal in his quest for an ambitious 200/400m double, the first since American Michael Johnson achieved the feat in the 1995 Gothenburg worlds. The 25-year-old South African, Usain Bolts self-proclaimed successor as the next track star, is defending world and Olympic champion and world record holder, but he faces a loaded field that is sure to test him to the limit.

If you pick up the wrong edition of Little Women
If someone asked you if Beth dies in Little Women, what would your response be To me, its obvious: of course she did. Her demise is up there in the pantheon of literary deaths alongside Ophelia, Jacob Marley, and Matthew Cuthbert. But, as it turns out, this is not a simple yes or no question. And thus, an investigation.
This question came to me from a bookseller friend of mine, who was asked this very question by a customer: does Beth die in Little Women Clearly realizing it sounded like a trick question, the customer then explained that she had warned her daughter that the ending of Little Women was going to be sad, but upon finishing, her daughter didnt know what shed meant.
Because, in the version the girl read, Beth didnt die. Was some publisher going around removing a vital final chapter Are we soon to find published versions of Murder on the Orient Express in which the full train manifest arrives unharmed to their location A production of Romeo and Juliet where the young lovers sort out their miscommunication to live happily ever after But after a bit of sleuthing, it turns out that Little Womens complicated publication history means that Beth both does and doesnt die in that book.
Scarlet fever
Louisa May Alcotts debut novel was published in 1868 with the very long title Little Women: Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. The Story Of Their Lives. A Girls Book. This work, which Alcott never intended to have a sequel, ends with Beth contracting scarlet fever and recovering. Amy is sent away to live with their Aunt as Beth convalesces, Jo has success earning money with her writing, and John Brooke asks permission from the March parents to marry Meg. To Alcott, this was her version of happily ever after  allowing readers to imagine where the characters would wind up. But her publisher, thrilled with the sales figures for this book and hearing from the public about their desire for a sequel, requested that Alcott provide one. She did, in a second book published in 1869, titled Good Wives.
Good Wives contains Beths death, along with the still-contentious plotline finding Jo turning down Laurie and Laurie settling for Amy.
Jo then agrees to marry the much older Professor Bhaer, in a pairing that seems to have been Alcott trolling the Jo/Laurie fans who had written to her begging to know if their OTP would wind up together.
Original book
And it doesnt end there  Jo and Bhaer open a boys school! All the surviving little women have at least one baby! Marmee celebrates her 60th birthday! The whole volume sort of exists as a Sliding Doors moment making fans wish it had all ended at the end of the original book, but its existence means any contemporary publisher must choose which ending to include  the 1868 conclusion of Little Women, or the 1869 denouement of Good Wives
Most American editions combine both books into a single volume, titled Little Women. In the United Kingdom, the preference is apparently to keep them separated into two volumes. And thus, the existence of two books, both titled Little Women and both by Louisa May Alcott, that end in two entirely different ways.
And thus, we find my friends customers daughter, confused as to why her mother thought she would find the book upsetting. And we find the customer, baffled as to why her daughters edition of this classic novel is missing the entire second half.
Found disappointing
Its a particularly fascinating situation, as each publisher must choose where to end their printing of the story  with Alcotts ostensibly happy ending, or with the postscript that many have found disappointing Part of me is happy to know that copies are out there, ending as Alcott initially intended, with us all able to imagine a future for the March sisters. And yet, Beths death is as canonical as one can get, so perhaps it should be included along with the other sisters fates, in each new printing.

JVP calls for special Court to probe fraud and corruption
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday stressed the necessity of establishing a special court to expedite the cases on fraud and corruption charges.
Addressing the media yesterday at the JVP Headquarters, JVP Propaganda Secretary MP Vijitha Herath said appointing the Presidential Commission to investigate any crime or corruption is not enough to ensure good governance. There should be a mechanism to take legal action against those found to be responsible for such cases without delay.
Establishing a special Court for this purpose was an election pledge of President Maithripala Sirisena and his Yahapalana government, he added.
Commenting on a recent statement by Minister Rajitha Senaratne which claimed that Minister Ravi Karunanayakes alleged connection to the Bond issue is like a bulb of onion when compared to the fraud and corruption occurred during the Rajapaksa regime, MP Vijitha Herath said this statement proves that Minister Senarathne had stolen public money being a member of Rajapaksa Regime. He added that Rajitha had leased the Modara Fisheries Harbour to a company for a monthly rental of Rs.125,000 for 25 years without Cabinet approval when he was the Fisheries Minister of Mahinda Rajapaksas government.
He further said there is an attempt to sweep the Bond issue under the carpet with Minister Ravi Karunanayake resigning from his ministerial post. But we wont let it happen since we have a similar experience where Tilak Marapana resigned from his ministerial portfolio in order to prevent any investigation on Avant Garde case.
He said that Minister Karunanayake is not the only person who is responsible for the Bond scam and it is necessary to identify all other culprits behind it and take necessary legal action against them without considering their position.
Addressing the occasion, JVP Kalutara District MP Nalinda Jayatissa said all culprits behind the Central Bank Bond scam could be easily identified by checking the call history of United National Party members who were in the COPE committee and being referred to as the Footnote gang.

Lanka Ashok Leyland turnover tops Rs 3.3 bn in 1Q 2017/18
Lanka Ashok Leylands top line for the first quarter of 2017/18 stood at RS 3.3 bn, a 59% increase over the 1st quarter of 2016/17.
This marks the second successive quarter the company has crossed a turnover of RS 3.3 bn. Gross profit for the quarter registered a 37% increase year on year to RS 250.5 mn despite higher import costs squeezing gross profit margins which fell to 7.7% against 9% a year earlier.
Operating costs fell 42% to Rs 51 mn for the quarter owing to a non-recurring reversal to boost operating profit to RS 210.8 mn a 102% increase over 2016. Prudent working capital management and cash flow optimization helped reduce net finance costs by 62% to Rs10.3mn this quarter against Rs 27.1mn for the same period last year. The result of a strong top line performance, a substantial provision reversal and efficient cost management saw the firm post a profit of Rs 168.4 mn, a remarkable 261% improvement year on year.
As of 30, 2017 Lanka Ashok Leyland held inventories valued at Rs 4.4 bn signifying a 14% increase from 2016/17, while interest bearing liabilities only rose 5% to Rs 2.1bn.
Commenting on the increase of inventories CEO, Umesh Gautam said, the rise in inventories comes as we have decided to upgrade our product line to switch over to more environment friendly BS3 vehicles with ABS brakes and other upgraded specifications.
For effective launch of BS3 products in Sri Lanka we have imported over 500 nos vehicles to give impact to market that in future all vehicles marketed by us will be BS3 Norms with upgraded specifications.
Asked about their performance Gautam, CEO of Lanka Ashok Leyland noted that this quarters performance has been commendable and reinforces the momentum and trajectory the company is on off the back of an impressive 4th quarter of 2016.
Even excluding the provision reversal this quarter, the growth in sales in spite of macroeconomic conditions is heartening and gives new impetus for the management going forward. Lanka Ashok Leyland has expanded to the Eastern province effectively covering every part of Sri Lanka and establishing a truly island-wide footprint to build off.
The exchange rate has continued to decline over the period pressuring our margins which has made it extremely important that we manage our costs effectively and keep our operation as lean as possible. Despite the high interest rate environment we operate in, our top line continues to be driven by strong sales growth continuing a trend we saw in the previous quarter. Furthermore, the company has renewed focus on its spare parts division which saw a 25% increase in revenue.

Managing the Sales Force in Modern Days
Sales management as a profession has gone up more prominently particularly with the progressions that have been occurring in the economy.
Sales Managers react to changes in nature by implementing new methodologies and strategies to improve Sales Capability. Sales Management reacts to new difficulties by perceiving the significance of expert capabilities. In this article, we discuss few strategies and responsibilities which revolves around sales managers in modern days.
Management is defined as a process of planning, organizing, directing, motivating, coordinating and controlling the activities where the same principles can be applied to managing the sales team in a most efficient and effective manner. In fact, in term of the functions of sales management in modern days, the sales manager needs to focus, define, allocate, monitor progress, take corrective action and make sure each activity is accomplished successfully.
Sales managers role in research
In the management role of sales, the responsibility to achieve the organizational corporate objective is by the way of achieving the functional objective (target). Furthermore, sales objectives are translated into sales targets which are a quantifiable measure where the sales manager needs to be a researcher to understand the market potential accurately.
In addition, the competition, the behaviours of products and brands, the sales potential of the market, customer needs and market conditions changes that take place over a period of time need to be explored and investigated by the sales manager.
Meanwhile, the sales target setting will be discussed in detail in Sales forecasting, but most of the time it is observed that sales managers focus on their routine activities and less priority is given to market research or completely neglected at most of the times.
Furthermore, in some instances the sales managers view in setting up the sales targets in a narrow aspect where targets are set based on the previous month or same month last year achievements. Also, the achievement is looked at only by the numbers, but not the other market conditions which were favorable or non-favourable towards the achievements of previous year or the month.
Meanwhile, if the sales manager expect to enjoy the performance in the current year as a benchmark to the previous year, it is also needed to make sure the competencies of the sales team, commitment, level of motivation and maturity level of the sales people is also bench marked accordingly.
Manpower planning
For example, in most of the cases in sales consultations, it is evident in certain cases that sales have not increased by substantial percentage over a period, but when assessed, it is seen that most of the time the sales efficiency or per sales person contribution has been declined, in fact, most of the time the sales manager does not take much interest to look into this setback. As a result, we need to emphasize that sales managers need to focus and allocate more time on research of sales environment which can create some better results on achieving the targets and maintain the sales costs.
Market conditions and sales competencies
Many external factors could create an impact on sales volumes. The government regulations, political stability, technological changes, climatic conditions, economical surrounding, and also social conditions can have an impact on own and competitor sales volumes. Also the customer preference could be changed over time.
Accordingly the capability and the competency requirements of the sales people have been changed over a period. If the sales manager fails to research on these circumstances, all the activities carried out will be a waste. Sales manager need to take the leadership in matching the sales competencies of the sales force to the requirements of the market and monitor performance closely otherwise, the sales manager will realize the mistake after some times when it comes to monthly or annual review or at target setting for the next financial year.
Sales Managers role in anticipation
Marketing is defined as the management process which identifies & anticipates the customer needs to satisfy them at a profit to the organization in a socially responsible manner. By all means, where the same responsibility and the accountability remain with the sales manager to implement the marketing definition to anticipate the needs and wants of the customer, distributor, retailer and the channel partners.
Especially when it comes to achieving the organizationalgoals, the sales managers highly depend on the channels and business partners including the distributors and retailers. Distributor as an investor and businessman his concern is mainly on ROI, and we see most of the time the sales managers knowledge and competency level on finance management, financial concepts and reporting is not substantial and as a result failing to respond, negotiate, and convince the distributors concerns. Also seen some distributors are investors only but not entrepreneurs. The sales manager should be smart enough to answer the distributor concerns from the (win-win) business perspective.
The retailer's point of view is also the same, and if the sales manager is vigilant of the retailer perceptions, a proper competitor analysis and competitor benefits analysis to the retailer is done, most of the time it is possible to create an interest generating or convincing story (whats in it for me) for the retailer. Without which it is not possible to create a reason for retailer to promote, sell our own products and services. We all know we as customers buy the benefits not the features. As a result, the sales manager needs to assist the sales force with a proper benefit realization model for convincing the channel. Henceforth, the sales manager anticipation regarding the situations will assist for early preparation.
Sales manager is an organiser
In marketing STP means, targeting the right segment and deliver all marketing strategies towards selected targeted customer segment. Sales management is the most prominent in the promotional mix, focusing on segmentation, targeting the sales efforts accordingly to achieve the organizational objectives. Understanding the right market segment of the customer is critical in B 2 B and B 2 C markets. In B 2 B market at most times we see the lack of knowledge of the sales person to handle the customers, buyers or the influencers. For certain technical products most of the time the sales manager fits in with the knowledge and the skills, but the issue is with the persuasion, selling and the basic interpersonal skills. In such situations the sales manager holds a major responsibility in balancing the capabilities
In such situations, the sales manager holds a primary responsibility in making sure there is a balance of capabilities. Also in B 2 C markets we find that understanding the segments, and customization of the offers. If we analyse the retail markets, in modern trade we can find the the bigger packages (1 kg or 1.5 liters), whereas in small retail shops in rural and extreme interiors availability of smaller sachets and packs. Though it is the distribution strategy of the organization, the management and execution of such strategy is a fundamental requirement of the sales manager. Allocating the sales efforts and the level of service frequency assigned to each segment of the customers or retailers is critical in terms of maximizing the opportunity for sales. In one of the B 2 B team discussions, a concern came up from one of the sales team was that the time is a constraint to visit the existing base, service them and to answer their telephone calls and to attend to their requirements and concerns. In a situation like this, its difficult to think of a sales funnel and more prospects. The take home for the sales manager is that if the salesman is in this mind-set the probability of achieving the organizational objectives and goals will be very low. The sales manager needs to be extremely vigilant of the allocation of sales efforts and managing efforts while keeping the focus on resource enhancement wherever required for the best efficiency and output.
Sales controlling and evaluations
Planning and control go as an integrated unit whereas Sales objectives are assessed to inspect where we stand today, how we set out, where we are going, and how to reach there. Sales plans are analyzed alongside approaches and techniques. The control procedure begins by setting up the execution measures. The real execution is then measured. The outcomes are contrasted and the models set. Varieties are profoundly inspected. Lastly, corrective action is made to solve the issue. Salespersons are in charge of controlling the individual effort exerted of the hierarchical units they head. The purpose of this control is to guarantee that business office targets come with as little wasted energy which could be expected under the circumstances. Salespersons begin by exploring the individual sales objectives of the firm and resolving the shortcomings likewise, setting quantitative principles against which to measure performance.
If the sales manager only evaluates and keep records of daily targets vs. actual by the sales team, it is not leading to any performance improvement but only recording the day-to-daysales figures. It is necessary to evaluate all possible drawbacks and any loss opportunities that the salesman is experiencing by having a closer evaluation on all efficiency KPIs.
Salesforce planning and supervision
To be an exceptional sales manager who is performing and maintaining a high efficiency like recruitment, selection, training, and utilization. The question most of the time is recruitment the function of the sales manager or the human resource manager. Even though this is the key accountability of the sales manager, who is an expert in understanding the right type of Sales person required for the market.
The same number of extensive organizations utilizing many offers toSalespeople is on the expansion, the requirement for managers whose sole task is to regulate the fieldoffering exercises of the Sales people is getting to be plainly unavoidable. The discoveries of the investigation are pre-empted to wind up evidently a base of deciding the sum and nature of supervision to be given to the business as a component of the organization's vital promoting plan. Obviously, these sales reps have gotbroad preparing, and rectifying the issue would be more affordable than reusing them. To limit of the conceivable separation suits, the discoveries of the examination would have the capacity to direct sales supervisors to ensure that they have done everything to motivating them.
Techniques of Selection
In sales force planning, supervision and selection the sales manager need to be extremely skillful. Given if the right choiceis made,close supervision can lead towards the organizational objectives as the leadership characteristics of the sales manager.
The sales managers role as a leader, mentor, consultant and coach to the team israre in modern sales organizations.
As a result one may argue the productivity and morale of the sales force are damaged by the sales leadership. The salesman is a human, and most of the time the sales manager tends to forget the fact that managing the motivation and managing the emotions of the sales team could generate better results than being policeman behind the salesman. Consequently, Proper training and socialization between the sales team can create harmony within the team and overall managing ofthe staffing function will contribute, in achieving the salesman objectives.
To emphasize, McGregor who formulated the X & Y theory suggested that any organization will have two types of sales people conversely the X type of sales people who will need more supervision, close monitoring and dislike work. On the other hand, the Y type ofsalespeople who are more proactive, work with passion and they dont need pushing to perform.
The sales manager needs to understand these two types of sales people, and if the correct approach is not made to handle these two categories of sales people the effort of managing the sales force will not be successful.
Effective recruitment and selection of salespeople is a standout amongst the most crucial tasks of sales management. It involves discovering individuals who fit the position required by a firm. Along these lines, enlistment and determination of staff start with a deliberately created work examination.
We will further discuss in the next weeks some of the other management areas of the sales manager for the modern days sales management.

McLeod wins world title, Merritts dream dashed
London: Jamaica's Omar McLeod added the world 110 metres hurdles title to his Olympic crown in London on Monday and jointly dedicated it to his mother and superstar Usain Bolt.
However, world record holder Aries Merritt's dream of winning at least a medal two years after a kidney transplant were dashed as the American 2012 Olympic champion finished fifth.
McLeod, 23, led from start to finish to take the title in 13.04 seconds from defending champion Sergey Shubenkov with Balazs Baji of Hungary taking a surprise bronze.
"It's crazy, it's my moment," said McLeod.
"I had to win tonight as my mother (Arnella Knight-Morris) was watching in the stands.
"I dedicate this win to my mother."
McLeod provided Jamaica with a much needed boost after both Bolt and women's double Olympic sprint champion Elaine Thompson failed to bring home gold in the 100m.
"I really wanted to come out here and keep the Jamaican flag high," said McLeod.
"Usain Bolt he's still legendary, this is also for you! His legacy to Jamaican athletics he deserves such a tribute!"
McLeod added: "This one is special, honestly. There was a lot of pressure coming in but I channelled it positively.
"It's totally different to last year where we had Usain and Elaine winning, which I used to propel me. I didn't have that this time so I really wanted to come out and shine my own light."
McLeod dominated the race leaving the others to fight it out for the minor medals with Merritt in contention until the final hurdle.
However, he weakened and Russian Shubenkov, who was running as an Authorised Neutral Athlete because of his country's ban over a massive doping scandal, burst through to take second with 2016 European silver medallist Baji edging Frenchman Garfield Darien for the third spot on the podium.
"I'm so frustrated," said Shubenkov. "I struggled over the last few hurdles.
"The Jamaican is just too fast. I'm just happy to be competing at a world champs and get a world medal. Last year was a disaster and not just because of the Russian ban (on competing at the Olympics) so I'm happy to be back winning a world medal.
"To be honest it doesn't matter the colour of the vest I am wearing, it is more important that I gave pleasure to the people in my country who were watching."
Merritt said it felt "great to be back in London where I won Olympic gold".
"The crowd greeted me very warmly. Of course, I am not happy to be in lane nine but just being in the stadium is enough for me," he said.
"I am not even meant to be running, so I'm more happy to be here than not be here.
I am back on the world stage, that's the main thing.
"It's definitely possible for me to medal in the future. Everyone in the hurdling game is hurdling well.
"Since I broke the world record it's really transformed. There are a lot of new people and new talent, and that's fine. I'm just happy still to be part of it." AFP

Minimum Standards of Medical Education must be gazetted: GMOA
Efforts are being made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe through intervening to gazette the Minimum Standards of Medical Education while the Health Minister is trying his best not to gazette it, the Government Medical Officers; Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference health at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the GMOA made a written request from President Maithripala Sirisena last evening to appoint a Presidential Commission to investigate SAITM, its past and present, similar to the Commission appointed to investigate the Central Bank Bond Issue. According to Dr. Herath, the Health Minister should immediately resign from his position if he fails to keep his own promise and gazette the Minimum Standards of Medical Education on or before August 14th. Three more working days and five full days are left for him to keep his own promise made to the country by stating that the gazette will be issued in two weeks. He is wasting millions of public funds on the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital.
The gazette on Minimum Standards of Medical Education will expose the low standard of SAITM and its education, prevent the birth of institutions similar to SAITM in the future, enable patients to obtain medical treatment from hospitals with confidence just as they did in the past and do now and they will not need to check the standard of the doctor they receive medical treatment from, he added.

Mohammad Amir stars as leaders Essex thump Yorkshire
LONDON, Monday: Unbeaten Division One leaders Essex thumped Yorkshire inside two days to strengthen their bid for a first County Championship title in 25 years.
Captain Ryan ten Doeschate's 88 took Essex from 188-8 to 231 all out before lunch - a first-innings lead of 118. A second superb spell of pace bowling in the match from Mohammad Amir (5-54) then saw Yorkshire bowled out for 150, and Essex eased to 34-2 for victory.
Pakistan paceman Amir was unplayable at times on a seamer-friendly pitch at Scarborough, finishing with career-best match figures of 10-72.
Essex now lead second-placed Lancashire by 49 points with five games left.

Hales has been in superb form in recent weeks. The 28-year-old smashed 95 off just 30 balls in the T20 Blast on Saturday and scored an unbeaten 187 to take Nottinghamshire to victory in the One-Day Cup final at Lord's last month. Chris Woakes hit a half-century on his return from injury against Middlesex to give Warwickshire a decent chance of a first Championship win of the season.
The England all-rounder, who was out for two months with a side strain, made 53 as the Bears closed on 293-8 at Lord's - a lead of 258.
Skipper Tom Abell and Steven Davies put on an unbeaten 138 as hosts Somerset recovered from 96-4 to end day one in an improved position against Surrey. On a rain-hit day, Abell (88 not out) and Davies (68 not out) led Somerset to 234-4 before wet weather arrived.

NCP meeting in turmoil
The North Central Provincial Council meeting held yesterday morning ended up in turmoil as members belonging to the Joint Opposition group created a rumpus by burning the order papers alleging that the appointment of Council Chairman D M Amaratunge is illegal.
It all began when former Council Minister K H Nandasena stood up and claimed that the new chairman had no legal status as the Joint Opposition group commanded the majority in the house.
All efforts made by new Chairman D M Amaratunge to conduct business in the house ignoring the protest campaign launched by Joint Opposition members wearing black bands led by former chief minister S M Ranjith Samarakoon and former Ministers K H Nandasena H B Semasinghe and P B Ratnayake failed due to the loud din and the smoke enveloping the chamber by the burnt order papers.
Chief Sergeant at Arms Rohana Dodanwela was seen moving in the chamber trying to douse the fire. Tension within the chamber heightened once again as UNP member Aruna Buddhika threw a bottle of water towards the joint opposition group members.
There after the protesting joint opposition members walked out from the chamber and continued the protest campaign seated on the stairs at the main gate of the council complex.
A heated exchange of words ensued between the Joint Opposition members and the UNP member Aruna Buddhika as the latter peeped out of a window of the chairman's official room in the first floor and abused the opposition members. Later, Chairman D M Amaratunge continued the business of the house in the absence of opposition members and adjourned the council meeting for August 22. Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne was not present in the house yesterday.

In the neighbours landscape
Sri Lanka and India are interrelated to one another. Both these nations are interlinked in numerous ways, especially in social, cultural religious and linguistic factors.
Sigiriya frescoes (paintings) are excellent in nature and unique treasures of Sri Lanka. It is stated that these famous Sri Lankan frescos belonged to the 5th century AD of King Kassapas regime. The Sigiriya frescoes especially depict beautiful female figures. These female frescoes are exclusively adorned with beautiful jewellery such as bangles, armlets, necklaces and ear ornaments. Even the colour complex of the female figures are seen in different shades. The head dressings of these females are unique in nature.
Exquisite paintings
Generally, the scholars interpret these female frescoes, as divine females and female royal members. Many of times different scholars interpret these exquisite paintings differently, mainly in accordance with their own interpretation. Some scholars interpret and emphasise these female frescoes as Apsaras. Some of the scholars interpret these females are on their way to worship a shrine at Piduraangala.
The female painting figures were depicted and adorned with lower waist garments. These exceptional figures are not at all seen in full size. All the figures are depicted with low waist figures. The majority of these female figures are depicted with flowers in hand or holding traditional flower trays in hand to offer to the Gods.
All the female figures are depicted with different facial expressions, different eye focusing positions along with different head positions. Most of the scholars assumed that these female figures must be the royal females of the royal courts of King Kassapa. Still, these paintings reflect and reveal the nature of divine practices of royalty, lifestyle and atmosphere of the selective period.
Indian influence
Another world famous similar frescoes could be seen at the Ajantha and Ellora caves of India. The Ajantha and Ellora caves are located in the western state of India, Maharashtra.
These caves contain 29 rock cuts. It is stated that it belongs to the period of 2nd to 6th century A.D. These cave paintings reveal the divine Buddhist practices at that time. These caves contain numerous rock cut sculptures and exclusive paintings. These sculptures and paintings deeply reveal how the Buddhist cultural arts influenced the Indian arts during the selective time. According to historical evidence, these caves were built in two different phases. The first phrase roughly belongs to the 2nd to 4th A.D century. The second phrase is considered from 4th century A.D to 6th century A.D. The Ajantha caves contain nearly 250 feet length of wall rock. These exclusive aspects of the sculptures and paintings portray the ancient Buddhist monastery and the nature of worship practices of Buddhism in the worship halls.
Another set of rock painting is seen nearly 62 miles away from Ajantha caves. These caves are named Ellora caves. Ellora caves contain the numerous frescoes and sculptures of Hindu, Buddhist and Jain themes. All the Sigiriya, Ajantha and Ellora cave paintings are considered as the contemporary period of Indian and Sri Lankan paintings. And all are closely linked to one another in the style, nature and figures.
Pallava period
Another set of Indian paintings belonged to the Pallava period paintings of South India. The Pallava period in South Indian chapter reflected the continuations of earlier periods. There is no concrete evidence to support it. The paintings have been dated from the 7th century AD. Among the Pallava kings, Mahendravarman, who was celebrated as a famous painter was called tiger among the painters. Mahendravarmans skill in painting was recognized according to a stone inscription. Mahendravarman wrote, __ a thesis on paintings called Thantchana Chithram.
During Mahendravarman,s reign by his order in the famous Chithannal caves, numerous paintings were painted. Paintings related to dance were painted on the walls. One of the most celebrated paintings is that of Lord Nataraja, the cosmic dancer, at the entrance of the cave. And it is after seeing this painting that the saint Thirunavukarasar Nayanar sang what else is there to see. The paintings, during the Pallava period, still appear in the Kanchi Kailasa Nathar temple, and Mamandur caves.
Following the Pallava period, the paintings received a boost. During the Chola period, in Thanjai Bragatheeswarar temple, numerous paintings were painted on the walls and the roof.
Royal depiction
One of the paintings depicts Lord Shiva seated on a tiger skin and watching a dance performance of the Apsaras. Another painting depicts, the cosmic dance of Lord Nataraja, watched by the devotees and by the Bramins on one side, and on the other the ruler Raja Raja Chola, and his three consorts enjoying the performance.
In most of these paintings, the expressions are very clear. Tragically the most famous paintings on the walls of the Thanjai Bragatheeswarar temple were damaged by a fire. But efforts were made to resuscitate. Unlike sculptures and rock inscriptions, the paintings are likely to suffer damages and destructions, due to natural or manmade causes.
Yet the ancient Sri Lankan and Indian paintings and sculptures have close concrete links with one another.

Ostapenko falls to US qualifier Lepchenko
Toronto: Qualifier Varvara Lepchenko rallied to stun French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko 1-6, 7-6 (7/2), 7-6 (7/5) on Monday in the first round of the WTA hardcourt tournament in Toronto.
American veteran Lepchenko, 31-years old and ranked 68th in the world, trailed 6-1, 3-0 before turning things around against the 12th-ranked Latvian, who had followed up her Roland Garros triumph by reaching the quarter-finals at Wimbledon.
I think I woke up, I was a little bit in the sleeping mode for a set and a half, said Lepchenko, a former top-20 player herself. All the credit to her, she played amazing tennis - she hardly missed any ball from the very beginning.
Once I gave her a little push back, thats when the game started. I pretty much focused on my game. AFP

Health Ministry refuses to settle bill for special drugs of Parliament Medical Centre
The Health Ministry has refused to settle the outstanding bill for special pharmaceutical drugs issued by the Medical Centre of Parliament, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya informed Parliament yesterday.
UPFA MP Ranjith de Zoysa, bringing to the attention of the Speaker that the Medical Centre of Parliament has stopped issuing medicine, asked as to why Parliament does not settle the overdue amount of Rs. 45 million to the State Pharmaceutical Corporation (SPC).
About 1,200 Parliamentary staff and public representatives can obtain medical treatment from the centre. When I went to the centre today, they refused to issue any medicine, the MP said.
The Speaker said the bill of the Parliament Medical Centre is settled by the Health Ministry, adding that Parliament could not take responsibility for that.
I spoke to Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senarathna over the matter. He cited an audit inquiry as the reason for not settling the bill. The Health Ministry has refused to pay for special medicinal drugs. You can obtain normal treatment, but the centre has suspended issuing special medicinal drugs, he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he would inquire about the matter from the Health Minister.
Meanwhile, Parliament had yesterday returned a stock of fruits as the stock was not up to the standards. Fruits such as bananas and pineapples are supplied to Parliament regularly.

Patient passion
Being a Prefect gives you a taste of power at a very young age. It is how you use that opportunity at such a young age that defines you. Perfect Prefects features Head Prefect of Kingswood College Udaya Sumanasena who shows strong leadership skills and stamina in this post and shared with us the lessons he has learnt when it comes to successfully wielding power.
Sumanasenas first lesson is that you need a strong personality to deal with a school community which is a mixture of teachers and students from various social and political backgrounds. This gives the young Head Prefect his or her first taste of power, having to adapt and deal with so many different personalities. The Head Prefect needs to listen to everyone carefully, use logic and reasoning powers and needs to be patient and understanding. These skills and traits should be what the Head Prefect should possess.
Compassionate and understanding
Handling people from different backgrounds, different economical statuses, multi-cultural and multi-religious backgrounds is no easy task but needs to be approached with empathy and a competent intellect. A strong leader needs to be compassionate and understanding. In history we have seen plenty of leaders who are strong, but who have become despotic because of a lack of compassion.
All of us are social beings. I possess emotions such as love and compassion. I am humane and kind. But sometimes I need to control be tough. I cannot always be emotional. In order to fulfill the responsibilities of my post I need to control my emotions, said Sumanasena.
Patience and remaining calm when things start to get out of control is a must when you are in any leadership role in a school. You need to compose yourself and you need to be focused. This temperament will help you perform any role.
Sumanasena looks up to leaders who are mentally and physically strong. According to Sumanasena, they should have good interpersonal relationship skills. Decision making is a vital personality attribute that needs to be perfected. A leader should be able to make stable decisions. Sometimes these decisions need to be made quickly. Sometimes a Head Prefect should be able to make decisions under pressure without depending on others.
Future aspirations
I wish to be a scientist. However I would like to take up any challenge that will lead to a career that would be beneficial for me as well as society. Mass killings and massacres which are taking place all over the world in the name of political and racial conflicts make me feel so emotional. Some natural disasters occurred in Sri Lanka and all over the world during the past few months. This made me so passionate as thousands of infants and people died for no reason, explained Sumanasena.
Sumanasena is into aesthetic activities which he says gives him spiritual and mental satisfaction. It provides me with the opportunity to relax while enjoying good books and music. Also I believe interests in Arts is very important to personal and character development which some in the present generation lacks, said Sumanasena
For inspiration Sumanasena looks to his parents. His father is a technical officer working for Sri Lanka Telecom. His mother attends to the needs of the children and duties at home. Sumanasena being the eldest in the family has a great responsibility, as he has to be a role model to his siblings as well as being a loving and caring brother. His parents give him so much support when it comes to his studies and his future career. He proudly says that he is no one without his parents support and guidance.
Happy and free
As mentioned before Sumanasena loves the aesthetics. He loves to watch classical movies and enjoys all sorts of writings which gives him immense pleasure. I do read during my leisure and it gives me a heavenly feeling, making me so happy and free, says Sumanasena.
Sumanasena believes that when facing something particularly challenging, it is normal to become anxious. But he overcomes these feelings by remembering everything in life he is grateful for such as the love, strength and courage given to him by his parents, teachers and gentlemen of Kingswood. This is how he makes up his mind, because he believes he is a strong person and can meet any challenge.
I believe a good leader should possess a balanced personality, mixing patience, understanding, stability and human qualities and physical strengths. Such a man can be a successful leader with a strong personality, pointed out Sumanasena.

Plans to transform Waters Edge expanse into countrys best leisure city -Champika
The area around Waters Edge hotel, Battaramulla is set to become the best city of recreation and leisure in the coming years, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka yesterday said.
Moves are afoot to convert the area into a sustainable dengue free zone as part of constructing foundation infrastructure,he said.
Megapolios Ministry sources said moves are also underway to reduce pollution in waterways in the area under the envisioned plan.
The management of the hotel is currently engaged in the task of transforming the area into a dengue free zone with the support of the public and health ministry experts.
They have formed a Task Force with the help of the public to eradicate dengue from the area of the proposed Leisure City, sources said.
Minister Ranawaka said the citys canals are being cleaned at least once every week now. The ministry has received instructions from the President and the Prime Minister to keep the citys waterways clean.
We have started cleaning and reconstructing canals the progress of which is reported to us by Sri Lanka Navy, he said.
The Waters Edge management has done well to gather the public around their efforts to transform the area into a dengue free zone, because there is nothing much we can do without their active participation to keep their environs clean, he said.
Besides, the minister said,the government alone cannot do the work because we have not invested a five cent for waste management for the last few decades despite that we have spent billions on highway constructions and mass scale city beautification projects.
It came to light whilst we were on canal reconstructing and cleaning, that lack of toilets and poor sanitation have put the citys health at risk, Minister Ranawaka said.
Moves are underway to deal with these issues, the minister said.

Powerful earthquake kills at least 13 in China, 175 injured

At least 13 people were killed and 175 more injured late Tuesday after a powerful earthquake struck a popular tourist area in southwest China, according to state media.
Of those hurt, about 28 had been severely injured, state-owned media outlet Xinhua said.
The quake struck Jiuzhaigou County in China's southwestern Sichuan Province late on Tuesday night.
At least five of the people who died were tourists, Xinhua reported, citing the information office of the provincial government. About 2,800 people were evacuated from the severely damaged Intercontinental hotel.
Rescuers are still working to clear the rubble, and there are people buried beneath the debris, state broadcaster CCTV said.
There was some disagreement over the size and power of the earthquake.
The US Geological Survey reported a magnitude-6.5 quake 35 kilometers (22 miles) west-southwest of Yongle, Xinhua reported it was 7.0-magnitude, citing the China Earthquake Networks Center.
Residents in Chengdu, the provincial capital -- 300 kilometers (186 miles) away from the epicenter -- told state media they had felt the quake.
The China Earthquake Administration has launched a Level I emergency response, the highest of its four levels, according to state media.
Almost 400 fire trucks and more than 1,100 firefighters were dispatched to the scene, CCTV said. They are bringing with them 55 life detectors, 30 rescue dogs and 24 generators.
Local authorities announced the closure of the Jiuzhaigou tourist area, which includes a national park known for its waterfalls and topographical formations, beginning Wednesday.
Yu Qian, a local taxation bureau official, told Xinhua that the earthquake cut off power and disrupted phone service in her neighborhood.
Photos from the scene showed what appeared to be pieces of buildings lying in the street, a stone the height of a small automobile in the street and a heavily damaged hotel entrance, its revolving doors twisted and rubble lying in front of them.
The temblor wasn't the only quake in China in the past 24 hours.
On Wednesday morning, a magnitude-6.3 earthquake struck northwestern China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, close to the border to Kazakhstan, the United States Geological Survey said.
The quake struck at 7:27 a.m. local time. Its epicenter was 107 kilometers (67 miles) south-southeast of Dostq, Kazakhstan, at a depth of 25.9 kilometers (16 miles), the USGS said.
There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage, due to the sparsely populated nature of the area.

Ravi K. and the JO
Much is being made of the Ravi Karunanayake imbroglio, with the Joint Opposition virtually on cloud nine, having seized upon a juicy morsel for its delectation while attempting to throw dust in the eyes of the general public as to the shenanigans of the Rajapaksas, their associates and members of the former regime. Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne hit the nail on the head when he said that the Ravi Karunanayake issue pales into insignificance compared to the king sized robberies of the members of the Joint Opposition. Dr. Senaratne said leaders of the JO are king sized robbers who were now pointing their fingers at Minister Ravi Karunanayake, speaking at a function at the Mannar Silawathura district hospital, on Monday. The minister said there are many charges against the leaders of the Joint Opposition, mega corruption, malpractices and murder, among them. The people should know the amounts stashed away in Dubai banks, belonging to leaders of the JO, he stated.
Member after member of the JO are today taking turns to appear on a pro-Rajapaksa TV channel to crucify Ravi Karunanayake against whom a no-confidence motion too has been presented to the Speaker. There is however one underlying thread that runs through these ravings and rantings of the so called monumental corruption under the Yahapalanaya government - a clear attempt to deflect from the gigantic acts of corruption that was carried out with impunity under Rajapaksa. It is also telling, that those who are making the loudest of noises are the very ones who are soiled and tainted with corruption, as the cases pending against them demonstrate. Taking hilarity to new heights, they are also calling for the resignation of Karunanayake.
It is not clear if Ravi. K. will step down or await the findings of the Commission before he takes such a decision. It is reported that even some government members have urged the minister to resign. But by no stretch of the imagination can members of the JO make such a demand. Having enriched themselves with impunity under Rajapaksa they have no moral right to ask the minister to resign. No minister in the Rajapaksa regime ever resigned. On the contrary those accused of corruption were protected while rapists and murderers had their cases withdrawn. One minister even had the privilege of having his wife, who was on death row as an accused in the murder of his mistress, released on a presidential pardon.
In any event, resignations in the political arena of this country is a very rare phenomenon. We are bereft of politicians of the calibre of Dudley Senanayake or Gamini Jayasuriya. Present day Lankan politicians only resign themselves to their fate, come the hustings.
Meanwhile, Minster Mahinda Amaraweera said the Special Presidential Commission has sent a clear message to aspiring politicians that they run the risk of being exposed for corruption. He also pointed out that no such mechanism was set up by the previous government to rope in the corrupt. Henceforth, he said, corrupt politicians would not be spared. For the first time, the President has taken steps seek out the corrupt within the government.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too has reiterated that the corrupt would be hounded. The UNP would never protect fraudsters or let them remain in the party, he told party grassroots members in Hatton. He said today even ministers are being investigated.
Be that as it may, never in recent memory has the guns been trained on a government minister, even from within the government, as has become the fate of the beleaguered Karunanayake. Speculation, though, is rife that his resignation is imminent. If so, this will be the first time since the resignation of Gamini Jayasiriya (in opposition to the Indo-Lanka Accord) that a government minister will be stepping down, on his own, albeit under a cloud. Of course there was the instance when ministers G.L. Peiris, S.B. Dissanayake and Mahinda Wijesekera, among others, threw away their portfolios and crossed the floor to signal the premature end to the Chandrika government. But this was under entirely different circumstances.
MRs take on divine wrath
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa says divine retribution was visiting those who maligned the Rajapaksa family, in an obvious reference to the Special Presidential Commission proceedings in connection with Ravi Karunanayake. MR was quoted in a daily English publication as saying when we were insulted we never appealed to the gods. Now those who insulted us have earned the wrath of the gods. It is divine retribution.
One would have thought that the coconut dashing spree engaged in by members of the Joint Opposition in the early days of the Yahapalanaya government was to invoke the wrath of the gods on the government, for, there obviously could not have even any other logical reason. In any event, the Commission appointed by the government is to expose wrong doings of members of the regine themselves which, one would have thought, would have pleased the gods rather than invoke their collective wrath.

Ravi under political spotlight
The biggest political development of the past week was the controversy surrounding Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake, relating to a Monarch Residencies penthouse transaction that had apparently taken place when he was holding the post of Finance Minister. The Minister gave evidence before the Presidential Commission probing the Bond issue, where he essentially denied having any knowledge of the purported transaction.
Political analysts were quick to point out that his appearance before the Commission in itself could be considered as a victory for the drive against corruption and the Governments pledge for transparency. Under the previous regime, such an occurrence would have been unthinkable. There was one well-known case where a Minister was summoned before Court during the previous regime and the said Minister got away by saying he was bitten by a snake that very morning. Nothing much came out afterwards in that case.
It will be in the Governments best interests to ensure that the Bond probe is taken to a logical conclusion where any guilty parties are punished in accordance with the laws of the land. In this case, Perpetual Treasuries, a Central Bank primary dealer, has been accused of benefiting through insider information during the governorship of Arjuna Mahendran whose son-in-law Arjun Aloysius is linked to the firm. The people expect nothing less from a Government which pledged to eliminate corruption when it came to power two years ago. The upcoming second anniversary of the National Unity Government (August 17) is a good occasion to remind the public that the Government is indeed committed to this core value.
Minister Ravi Karunanayake
In this backdrop, speculation swirled that President Maithripala Sirisena has requested Minister Karunanayake to step down from his current duties as Foreign Minister. In fact, one Sunday Sinhala newspaper carried a banner headline to that effect. However, both the Presidents Office sources and Minister Karunanayake swiftly rejected this report. This was to be expected since no one can be presumed guilty until the investigations are completed. It was reported that the President has requested the transcripts of the Ministers evidence sessions at the Commission, though this was not confirmed by his office. The Prime Ministers office has also rejected reports that the Minister has been asked to resign at this stage.
There have been growing calls for the Ministers resignation from political and civil society circles. Many SLFP Ministers have publicly expressed the view that the Minister should resign, at least on a temporary basis until the investigations are completed. Several UNP Ministers too have expressed the same sentiment on several occasions, albeit privately with the exception of Minister Daya Gamage who told the media that in his opinion, the Minister should resign. He hastened to add that this was strictly his own personal opinion, and the party should take a collective decision on this matter. Minister of Housing and Construction Sajith Premadasa said over the weekend that he would resign from his Ministerial post if he were asked to vote in favour of corrupt people in Parliament, though he did not mention any names.
In the meantime, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has accepted a no-confidence motion against Minister Karunanayake. It was revealed that both former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his elder brother former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa have not signed the motion, a rough copy of which was circulated at the wedding of Ramith Rambukwella, former minister Keheliya Rambukwellas son. Mahinda Rajapaksa was present at this wedding. Several websites which had obtained the signature list pointed out a major error  number 3 appears twice in the list. According to that list, only 32 numbers appear whereas, in reality, 33 members should have signed it.
Former President Rajapaksa later told the media that he would definitely vote for the motion once it is presented in Parliament. The Motion, a date for which is likely to be set this week, will be an acid test for the Government especially if a secret ballot is called for since some Ministers and other Members on both sides are likely to vote for the motion if that happens. However, the Motion itself is not likely to affect the continuation of the National Unity Government regardless of the outcome. A decision on this particular issue is however expected later in the year, after the SLFPs Annual Convention in September.
Why just one man
Adding to the controversy was a Facebook post by the Ministers daughter Onella, who wrote: Just ask yourself Why only one mans name comes up all the time in such a huge government I see everyone very easily resharing content on many pages on social media but all have only one name. My fathers name. Does everyone really believe for the last couple of years everything in the government is just one man This drew many comments across the various social media sites and on newspaper websites, both supporting and opposing her views.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has reiterated that his Government would not tolerate corruption in any form. He said all allegations of corruption under his Government would be investigated and action will be taken depending on the outcomes. There is no place for robbers in our government. We will remove them, Wickremesinghe said in the hill town of Hatton. He said a senior minister's quizzing for wrongdoing by the Attorney General reflected the freedom the Government has brought in.
We have filed cases against the Rajapaksa Government's corruption. The cases are going on. When the Central Bank Bond issue allegations were made against the Government, I appointed an internal probe and later it was referred to a Parliamentary Committee headed by an Opposition Member, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
Another significant event reported from Parliament was that the Supreme Court has found that certain clauses of the proposed new Inland Revenue Act are not constitutional. Announcing the Supreme Court's decision in Parliament, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said he has received the determination of the Supreme Court in respect of the Bill which has been challenged in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 121 (1) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka. The Supreme Court has determined that the Clauses 97, 98 and 100(1) (e) of the Bill are inconsistent with the Article 12 of the Constitution, and the Clause 167 is inconsistent with the Article 12, 13 and 14(1) (h) & (i) of the Constitution. These clauses may either only be passed by a special majority as per Article 84(2) of the Constitution or be amended as per the determination of the Supreme Court to remove the inconsistencies. The Joint Opposition has earlier cried foul over the proposed Bill. Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena, a classmate of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe at Royal College, Colombo, has increasingly become the face of the Joint Opposition (JO) given the corruption scandals surrounding the other JO members. Dinesh, the Parliamentary Group leader of the JO, has the advantage of not being tainted by any corruption allegations and as such, some have come to regard him as a potential Presidential candidate or 2020. The major factor that can ruin his chances is that he is identified with the communal camp of the JO that opposes any solution to the national issue.
2020 Presidential candidate
It is early days yet, but one is tempted to study the dynamics in the light of the widely held belief that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa could be a potential candidate for 2020 from the JO side. The former President is hampered by the reimposition of term limits via the 19th Amendment, so he cannot conceivably run for the Presidency again. However, he is eligible to run for any other position. Thus there is speculation that Rajapaksa is aiming for the Presidency by proxy, where he is likely to pull the strings behind the scenes if their candidate wins.
Minister Mangala Samaraweera
Elections are on everyones mind these days, though not necessarily of the Presidential variety. A healthy debate is going on about the Provincial Council elections in the backdrop of the Governments proposal to explore the possibility of holding elections to all nine PCs on a single day. There are several benefits of this proposal  it will save a lot of money at the end of the day because staggered elections can actually cost more money. But the biggest benefit is that the incumbent Government will be unable to pour all its resources to one or two provinces having the election. The best example of this scenario is the infamous Wayamba PC election in 1997, which was a black mark in the election history of Sri Lanka akin to the Lampu-Kalagedi referendum of December 22, 1982. Although some people in the Government as well in the opposition are not in favour of this proposal, latest reports indicated that the 20th Amendment to the Constitution containing this very propel has now been gazetted.
Moreover, there will be a new system which will change the present proportional system to include a mix of the first-past-the-post system and the Proportional Representation system. Under the latter provision, the Provincial Council Elections law would be amended to make way for the new system according to which 60 per cent of members would be elected by the first-past-the-post system and 40 per cent of the Proportional Representation systems. Accordingly, elections due for October for three Provincial Councils (North-Central, Sabaragamuwa and Eastern) have been postponed. Meanwhile, some PCs remain in a volatile situation. Northern Provincial Councils Health Minister Pathmanathan Sathyalingam has resigned while a tense situation was reported at the North Central Provincial Council sessions after Joint Opposition members of the Council set fire to a copy of the agenda.
Given that the term of some provincial councils ends only in 2019, analysts will be closely watching the next moves with regard to PC elections. Several Opposition figures have declared this to be an illegal move unless accompanied by a referendum and a two-thirds majority. The two main elections monitoring bodies PAFFREL and CaFFE have also voiced their opposition to the move. Local Elections, on the other hand, are likely by end of this year.
Another reason for the postponement of the Provincial Council elections is to facilitate the incorporation of a womens quota into the Provincial Council system as already introduced in the Local Government system. The proposal is to amend the Provincial Council law to make it binding on all political parties and independent groups to field at least 30 per cent female candidates in the PC elections. This is on the basis that the Government has taken a policy decision to increase female representation in all political decision-making bodies. The representation of women in Local Government is only about two percent, in provincial councils four percent and in Parliament, six percent, which is very low even by South Asian standards, leave alone the West.
Frequent talk of elections could leave a Government in a permanent campaign mode so it is important to concentrate on other pressing matters as well. Hot on the heels of the Hambantota Port deal, the Government is now gearing up for several other investments that could take the foreign debt burden off to some extent. Three airlines including Japanese Airlines are currently in negotiations with the Government, in efforts to divest 49% of the holding of the national carrier SriLankan Airlines, Minister Kabir Hashim said. Representatives of Japan Airlines, a fellow Oneworld Alliance member, have already visited Sri Lanka and met the Prime Minister. Initial discussions have commenced. This does not mean any deal or proposal has been established yet. The Minister did not wish to disclose the other two airlines. They have asked for information and we want to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) after which we will submit information to pursue it further, he said. Whichever airline SriLankan Airlines ends up partnering with, the rough framework of the agreement will be the same.
The partnership will certainly be a Public Private Partnership (PPP) and we intend on divesting 49% of the holding to come in with equity while 51% will be held by the state. We would hand over the entire management of the company, as we dont think we are the best at managing the airline business, said the Minister. Since 2009, a year after its separation from Emirates Airlines, SriLankan Airlines has been operating at a huge loss. In the most recent fiscal year, which ended in March 2017, the company reported losses of Rs. 27.79 Billion, up from a loss of Rs. 12.08 Billion the year before.
SriLankan officials are looking at other means of cost cutting until a deal can be finished for a strategic partner. SriLankan has boosted its route network recently with new destinations in India and it will be flying to Melbourne from October 29 this year. SriLankan also received several new Airbus A320 family NEO (New Engine Option) aircraft, although the current Government cancelled the previous Governments costly order for several Airbus A350 aircraft.
The Government is reassessing the security situation in the Jaffna peninsula following the recent attack on two policemen in Kopay by a gang of 12 knife and pole wielding thugs said to be from the infamous Ava gang which is known to have a few ex-LTTE cadres as well. The fact that some members of the group had been arrested in Colombo is likely to ruffle a few feathers in the security establishment.
The leader of the criminal gang Ava Group has been arrested along with five other gang members, police spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said. Three of the suspects, including Nishanthan have been arrested at Pettah bus stand. Another suspect has been arrested in Mattakkuliya while another two at Jaffna.
The gang leader Sathyavel Nathan Nishanthan, alias Nisha Victor, who is the main suspect in the recent attack on two police officers in Kopai, was taken into custody by the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID).
While keeping an eye on the situation, the authorities have emphasized that there is no immediate threat to the security of Jaffna peninsula being affected, since the post-war security apparatus is basically intact. The day-to-day security affairs in Jaffna are now mostly handled by the Police.
On a related note, Interpol in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Police is to hold a top level regional conference in Colombo this week to discuss issues pertaining to countering terrorism and transnational crimes that affect South and Southeast Asia. Sri Lanka Police will host the three-day workshop which will be held under the patronage of the Interpol from August 8 to 10 at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH). This event is significant in the light of global and transnational terrorism and crime concerns that have engulfed the region in the last few months.

Sex education vital to protect children from STDs: Prof. Piyadasa
Sex education is important for school children so as to protect from them from contracting Sexually Transmitted Diseases(STDs), Prof. Rohana Laksman Piyadasa of the Mass Communication Department of the Kelaniya University said.
He said so addressing an event organised to unveil a study report on Sex diseases and young sex patients aiming to identify the importance of sex education in Sri Lanka,in Colombo yesterday.
The study has been conducted based on the Kurunegalla district with the participation of 140 students aged between 16 and 19 by the Mass Communication Department.
According to the findings of the research, 17 per cent of students said that they were in doubt whether they had caught exposed to any Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD). It is alarming to note that the figure indicates that these youths had been expose to any Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD), Senior Lecturer Manoj Jinadasa said.
Dr.Gamini Wimalarathne of the Kurunegala hospital said young children should be well guided and educated to protect them from STDs and teenage pregnancy.
He said that a significant number of young persons are calling over at STD clinics for treatment. Herpes is the most common STD in the country, he said.
According to Dr.Wimalarathne, 8 per cent of patients, who call over at STD clinics are young children.
Attention should also be drawn to teenage pregnancy as 4 per cent of teenage pregnancy cases are reported from the Kurunagala district now.
Daughters, whose mothers are abroad, are more vulnerable to face sexual abuse than other young women, he said.
He added that parents should pay special attention to their children especially when attending tuition classes.

## Title: Should the Media be regulated

Should the Media be regulated
Eng. S. Hettiarachchi- employed at a government institution
Every media institution in Sri Lanka has its personal agenda; I wonder how the regulatory bill or a body could actually handle that part. When media institutions report, it might not be false, but the angle each institution takes has a vast difference.
It is good to have regulations but the government too should make sure that it would not cause any harm to media freedom. I still doubt whether we have media freedom even without any regulations.
Ashan Fernando- Accountant
Our people are used to comparing everything with the standards implemented in foreign countries, failing to understand should even culture and history of a country would have an impact on the reaction to news or a story. Sri Lankans would not react the same way that foreigners sometimes react to issues and therefore, it is vital to understand that difference. Sometimes the way some media report news on sensitive matters highlight the need to have regulations.
Journalists as well as many concerned groups panicked when the draft bill was released and that clearly shows the trust people have towards the government. People do not immediately believe when the government takes an initiative stating that it is to safeguard democracy, it has been the same in past as well.
Sanju Ratnayake- university student
I think social media and electronic media need systematic regulations. These days people are more dependent on news published by digital media. There is a higher tendency of some websites spreading false news therefore, that needs to be regulated.
At present everybody would put a post on Facebook or tweet when they happen to hear news but the problem is with accountability and accuracy.
The governments decision to form an independent media regulatory body has caused much controversy with many media stakeholders and journalists raising concerns that the bill would prevent the media from playing the role of watchdog. Many in the media have also questioned the transparency and content of the draft bill which they fear might have a hidden agenda to infringe on media freedom.
The draft bill which has been spoken of by the government many a time, came to the fore as the Ministry of Mass Media appointed a five-member committee to look into the proposed Independent Media Regulatory body. The committee consisted of Seetha Ranjani from the Free Media Movement, D. Lankapeli from the Federation of Media Employees Trade Union Federation, Upali Arambawela, representative of electronic media, R. Bharathi from Sri Lanka Tamil Media Collective and N.M Ameen from the Muslim Media Collective. It was headed by Wijayananda Jayaweera who was the former Communications Director at UNESCO.
The transparency of the process was questioned when it was reported that the draft bill was formulated by Wijeyananda Jayaweera alone who headed the committee and that the remaining committee members had not been involved in the process. The more troubling issue was the presence of a clause that could enable the Commission to compel the journalists to reveal their sources and media organisations, while journalists have refused to accept such a premise. It was reported that several organisations that have already submitted recommendations to revise the draft bill.
Director General of the Government Information Department Dr. Ranga Kalanasooriya recently told the media that the bill was still in its preliminary stages, that individuals and media organizations could present suggestions and amendments to the Independent Media Regulatory Body.
He said that only a discussion paper had been prepared by the Sub-Committee appointed to look into the Independent Media Regulatory Body and that there was no final draft on the proposed body, as yet.
Dr. Kalanasooriya said eight media organizations had participated in the initial discussions in June last year, and said the floor was still open to suggestions and amendments by interested individuals and organizations.
On July 11, Cabinet appointed a sub-committee to look into the preparation of the draft bill on the Media Regulatory Commission. The Cabinet sub-committee is comprised of Minister of Finance and Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera (Chairman), Minister of Special Assignments Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and Minister of Land and Parliament Affairs Gayantha Karunathilake.
Not all media stakeholders were involved in the process
Even though Dr. Kalansosoriya said that the FMM has been involved in the drafting of the above Act from its inception, C. Dodawatta, Present Convener of FMM denied their involvement in the process.
Then Convener of the FMM Seetha Ranjanee had participated in an initial meeting called in order to discuss issues related to media institutions and journalists. Soon after the meeting, a committee was appointed to look into matters in which she became a member, he said.
Ranjanee speaking to the Daily News affirmed that she only participated for the initial meeting and added that she was not a part of the Process. President of the Sri Lanka Muslim Council N.M Ameen also noted that it was just an initial meeting and added he was also curious as to why Dr. Kalansooriya told the media that he was a part of it when he was not.
Dr. Kalansooriya in the meantime said that though various media groups were invited to a few discussions, in the end it was Jayaweera who had been given the task of drafting an Act.
Dodawatte added that after the first meeting that was called to discuss issues, neither Ranjanee nor the FMM were aware of its progress thereafter.
Media organisations and civil society organizations have claimed that it was through newspapers that they learnt that Cabinet approval was granted for a public consultation on the draft.
For a long period now, the FMM has been lobbying for broader media reforms including regulations for ethical media usage. But, the participation of media institutions in the process has been gradually reducing which becomes problematic for the people to accept it unanimously, he said.
He said media regulations are vital and added that the process should be transparent, whilst giving space for open discussion on the contents.
One of the media experts, the Ministry had looked to, Nalaka Gunawardane said he was not part of the drafting process, but he took part in the discussions held between media and civil society organisations.
Everybody did not sit together and draft it, but after formulating the draft, the members discussed it, he said.
Gunawardene said some of the members were dissenting now as it has turned out to be a bit controversial.
He assured that Jayaweera made sure that all inputs were included in his draft and it was a combined effort.
In the meantime, Gunawardene also explained that another draft had also been prepared by the Executive Director for the Centre for Law and Democracy; an institution which aims to promote, protect and develop human rights, Tony Mendel. Mendel was also involved in the formulation of the Right to Information Act. He also works closely with the Denmark based agency International Media Support (IMS), an organization where Dr. Kalansooriya had been previously employed in.
Dr. Kalansooriya informed Daily News that financial support was obtained from IMS to conduct consultation in all 25 districts with regard to the media regulatory draft bill.
Toby Mendel was working on a revised draft; it is to be released soon. He met the heads of all private and government media institutions, the Press Commission and Editors Guild Association. He had noted down all the suggestions and recommendations given and all that would be included, he said.
Gunawardena said Toby Mendels draft will be forwarded to the Cabinet sub-committee soon and they would take the final decision on whether to release it or not.
There is a long way for a final draft but the draft ensures editorial independence and also it ensures the confidentiality of sources, he said.
Gunawardane meanwhile, pointed out that the problem was with forming an independent council and questioned how independent a council can be in Sri Lanka.
Several structural and operational concerns were raised by the media organizations.The proposed provisions ensure that the process is fair by all media organizations. After the revised draft is submitted, this would open for further discussions and debate. All the concerns pointed out by the organizations in the initial draft have been taken care of in the revised draft, he said.
Cabinet and Parliament to decide
Whilst both independent media regulatory drafts are to be completed soon, government sources insisted that they did not have a final draft yet. The Cabinet sub-committee is to decide which draft they would take into consideration.
Speaking to the Daily News, Convener of the Cabinet sub-committee, Deputy Minister of Skills Development and Training Karunarathne Paranavithana said the committee would look into the draft bill and discuss measures that needed to be taken.
He affirmed that the bill would not be a threat to media freedom in the country.
Though we have regulatory bodies such as the Press Commission and Press Complaints Commission for print media, they are with many shortcomings. The Complaints Commission is not active. Most importantly, not all media institutions are affiliated with it. That's a huge problem and that emphasizes the need for new regulations, he said.
Paranavithana also pointed out that the electronic media did not have any regulations and said there was no regulatory body to ensure that their reporting was ethical and fair.
Media standards should be maintained in a healthy democratic country. Media should be more responsible, while being accountable for what they report. It will be a democratic regulatory body not a soviet. All stake holders would be engaged to formulate the final draft, he said.
He affirmed that the opinions and suggestion of the media institutions, civil society organisations, academics and general public would be taken into consideration. Paranavithana added that the suggestions presented by Mendel would also be considered when deciding on the final draft.
He noted that many media institutions had expressed their displeasure over some provisions.
Some have sent their recommendations, whilst others consider it as an act of media suppression. Some media institutions actually left the discussion. They insisted that the audience are the regulators and they do not need any expert panel to decide on it. They left because of internal issues. There were representatives from other media who agreed that they need regulations and standards, he said.
The Deputy Minister explained that the same thing happened when the government brought in the Right to Information Act (RTI).
Everyone knows how useful it is now. Some people see everything negatively, these are not anti-democratic regulations. I would say if someone is opposing it, just point out the provisions and then I can answer their questions. We cannot entertain the people who always have a negative perception on the initiatives taken by the government. The final draft will be submitted to Parliament and they will take the decision, he said.

SLC holds strategic session ahead of Pallekele Test
The Sri Lanka team, its High Performance and Specialist resource team, the national selectors and officials of Sri Lanka Cricket spent a productive afternoon in Colombo today (Monday) at a strategic session aimed at recouping and regrouping ahead of the 3rd Test starting in Pallekelle on August 12.
Players, resource staff and officials alike shared in an open discourse with respect to technical, strategic, medical, psychological and personal data and requirements of individual players, as well as the team, states an SLC media release.
Speaking during the Brain Storming session SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala commended the players for their fight back against India in the second innings of the SSC Test, and advised them to believe in themselves as a talented and capable team of players.
We have some of the most talented players in the world, and you prove this in bursts. We also have some of the best cricketing knowledge and intelligence available in our resource and support team, so I advise you to use the science and strategic resources to make these performances consistent, Sumathipala said.
Head coach Nic Pothas, trainer Nick Lee, and physio Nirmalan Thanabalasingham made presentations with respect to sports medical and injury management as well as training and workload management explaining and expanding on the ongoing process. The two of them also reiterated that each individual player should be given the time and confidence to establish themselves, their personal strategy and their role in the team in order to perform to their full potential with consistency.
Speaking on behalf of the players Test captain Dinesh Chandimal and former captain Angelo Mathews both noted the technical and psychological support and resources being provided by SLC, and the individual talent of each player. They further noted that the strategic and scientific training plans implemented by SLC are paying dividends but would need more time to show definite results in game situations. They thanked SLC and the selectors for their continued faith and support even in the face of public pressures.
Former Sri Lanka captain and mentor Aravinda de Silva also addressed the team, encouraging them to have confidence in themselves and play to their strengths. He further advised the young players to focus on their talent and capabilities, giving their best for their country and to not be discouraged by extraneous elements that seek to demoralize them via social media and gossip sites.
Chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya noted that with the correct roadmap and procedures in place, tangible, positive results were a matter of time and requested everyone to stay focused and remain positive with the 2019 World Cup as their singular goal.
Sri Lanka are currently facing what is perceived to be a slump in their performances and ranking, as it invests in rectifying a series of administrative and strategic missteps over the past several years.
Sri Lanka dominated the cricket world since 1996 to 2014 in all three formats of the game, however a lack in strategic investment in areas such as injury and player management during this time has resulted in a longer than anticipated re-building period after the retirement of several senior players.
The slump is a cyclic phase experienced by every great cricketing nation, and has been witnessed with Australia, England, South Africa, New Zealand and even India two years ago. The elected administration of SLC has prioritised the identification and rectification of these key areas and has over the past year invested in the best technical and professional resources for the national team, which together with a structured and effective action plan will in time lead Sri Lanka back to its rightful place on the global cricketing arena.
Cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha closed the session by reminding everyone that Sri Lankans are not only some of the most talented and intelligent cricketers in the world, but are one of the most resilient, strong and courageous people who have always strived for greatness, and invited every passionate cricket lover to stand behind the team with patience and belief as One Team One Nation.

Solar energy drive adds 118 mw to national grid
The Soorya Bala Sangramaya, which started nine months ago, is in full swing now adding 118 megawatts to the national grid. Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera said the Soorya Bala Sangramaya (Battle for Solar Energy), which assists to strengthen the countrys economy, is among the key projects of the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry.
It is significant that this 118 megawatt electricity generation is equal to that of the Uma Oya project. Without allocating funds from the government, we were able to add 118 megawatts to the national grid, the Deputy Minister said.
The Deputy Minister made these remarks after opening a newly established solar energy system at Royal College, recently.
He said the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry launched this community based power generation project titled 'Soorya Bala Sangramaya' in collaboration with Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA), Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) aiming to promote the setting up of small solar power plants on the rooftops of households, religious places, hotels, commercial establishments and industries.
It is expected to add 200 megawatts of solar electricity to the national grid by 2020 and 1,000 megawatts by 2025 through this intervention. Perera projected that the entire electricity network of the country will be based on renewable energy by 2050. The entire energy demand will be met by renewable energy by then. It will be a huge advantage for the environment
Under the Soorya Bala Sangramaya programme, consumers will have options to generate and use electricity in their premises. In the case of electricity in excess of their requirements, they can sell the excess to the national grid or bank it for later use. According to the electricity usage, the customer can select a preferred option from the three schemes as Net Metering, Net Accounting and Micro Solar Power Producer.
Customers can obtain soft loan facilities from state banks for purchasing solar energy systems, the minister said.

Solar panels for one million households
The solar energy war launched by the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry will transform the roofs of one million houses into solar power panels, Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He said the ministry has adopted several strategies to encourage erecting solar energy panels in households. Solar energy panels have also been provided to temples. Cabinet approval has been obtained to erect solar energy panels on roofs of all state institutions.
A solar energy panel will be erected at the Kegalle St. Josephi's Balika Vidyalaya too within the next two months.
Minister Siyambalapitiya was addressing a meeting after laying the foundation stone for a technological laboratory building at the Kegalle St. Joseph's Balika Vidyalaya, recently.
He said Sri Lanka possessed an advanced system of education when compared to several other countries in Asia. However, the wide gap between education and job demand was a big problem faced by the country. Although 100,000 graduates found employment five years ago, a similar number of graduates were languishing without jobs today.
Seeking a state job should not be the end result of education. The introduction of technological education to schools was a good decision taken by the state as it will enable students to branch out into other fields after completing education.
This division also helped to curtail the demand to enter the so-called popular schools because technological laboratories were a facility restricted to less popular schools, he said.

Speaker Karu Jaysuriya observed that the future course of action with regard to the no-confidence motion submitted by the Joint Opposition against the Foreign Minister will be informed to the House on Thursday.
The Speaker also observed that there are some legal issues pertaining to the motion and its content and the matter has been referred to the Attorney General. Joint Opposition member Wimal Weerawansa raising a point of order inquired as to why the government delays the process of no-confidence motion and delays the debate.

Sri Lanka seeks to strengthen cultural ties with China

Sri Lankan officials said that they hoped to further strengthen cultural ties with China at the opening of a new building of the China Cultural Centre in Colombo.
Speaking at the inauguration of the new premises Tuesday, Deputy Minister of Cultural Affairs Palitha Thewarapperuma said Sri Lanka and China had shared a very strong cultural bond since ancient times and the opening of this new building was a historic moment for both countries.
The Chinese Cultural Centre in Sri Lanka was set up as the first in South Asia. Since being established as a formal institution to promote the exchange of cultural and educational ties between the two countries, the center has been actively involved in many programs to promote Chinese culture and language in the island country.
The focus of the China Cultural Center is to provide opportunities to the school children, university students and teachers to learn about China.
Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Yi Xianliang said, "the cultural centre should not be a centre only for Sri Lankans or the Chinese nationals here. It is open for all nationalities from any part of the globe."

Sri Lanka suffers big blow: Herath ruled out of Pallekele Test with stiff back
Sri Lanka who are 0-2 down in the three-match Test series against India suffered a massive blow ahead of the third and final Test starting at Pallekele on Saturday when their most experienced bowler and leading wicket-taker Rangana Herath was ruled out with a stiff back.
Rangana is out of the third Test with back fitness. He bowled nearly 200 overs in three Tests and we also need to understand that he is nearly 40 years old. You cant ask so much from a player like that it is a lot for that body, said Sri Lanka cricket manager and national selector Asanka Gurusinha.
We need to manage him because weve got two Tests against Pakistan and three against India. Its not something that happens to a 25 or 26-year-old when you are 40 and playing like that, hes retired from one-day cricket. It is upto us to work with Rangana if we want him to play for another 12 months or so. Weve got to look after him, he said.
It happened during the SSC Test. Rangana was coming into the pavilion three or four times after a spell when he was bowling and the physio would stretch him, it wasnt easy.
Herath had a heavy workload in the past three weeks he bowled 49 overs at Galle and 42 at the SSC and prior to that he had sent down 71.1 overs in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe.
Heraths injury comes on the back of injuries suffered by fast bowlers Nuwan Pradeep and Suranga Lakmal which leaves an already inexperienced bowling line up further depleted in resources.
Pradeep is out for three weeks and Suranga has not recovered fully but we are pretty confident we have to go with that. We cant say we are depending on Rangana all the time. Thats what we are trying as a group, not to depend on one bowler. Its a good time for the rest to step up. I am sure we are going to do it now, said Gurusinha.
We havent seen the wicket at Pallekele and I hear that it is raining in Kandy. Well have to go there and look at the wicket and decide on our combination.
Player Management
Gurusinha said that player management was something the team discussed quite seriously on Monday considering the spate of injuries that the team was going through at the moment.
Injuries are twofold one is controllable and the other is uncontrollable. Except with the one we had with Nuwan Pradeep which was controllable when I say controllable it was his workload. We have to look at his workload and manage it well because he bowled 43 overs in the first Test. Things like that we had discussions yesterday (Monday) how we are going forward.
We dont want to repeat that again, said Gurusinha.After the Galle Test the workload on Pradeep increased when Sri Lanka fielded only one fast bowler for the second Test at the SSC. Pradeep was forced to leave the field after bowling 17.4 overs with a left hamstring injury.
On hindsight we can say that now, but we had to pick the side not to suit another fast bowlers fitness levels but look at a side that can win a Test for us. It was a risk we took and it didnt work, said Gurusinha.
Aselas (Gunaratne) hamstring was nothing to do with workload it was a sudden thing. We had more finger injuries and things like that and others but we are looking at player management very seriously. Its not what we are doing at training. If a fast bowler has bowled 50 or 40 overs in a Test match he might not bowl a single ball at training because their bodies have to recover. Those are things the physios and trainers will plan with the head coach.
We have already started from the second Test player management very seriously with Lahiru Kumara and Vishwa (Fernando) who were in the squad. They bowled a couple of days in the nets but the third day they didnt bowl it was more of a recovery day for them. Thats how we are working on right not. I dont think we will get that anymore but injuries are something that we are very worried about, he said.
India has 4 batsmen in the top 10
In two successive Tests the Indian batting line-up has topped 600 against the Lankan bowling line up but Gurusinha pointing out the reasons for it said, Our bowling is not weak but inexperienced thats something we are working on and its not going to happen overnight.
Out of the top 10 batsmen in the world there are four Indian batsmen. You cant have players in the top 10 unless you are consistently performing. That just shows they have a very strong batting line up.
A lot of countries dont have that having four players in the top 10 of your batting line up. We have to understand that and play bowlers who can take wickets, but it will come down to what type of wickets that we are going to play on.
The Indian batsmen in the top ten at the start of the Test series were Pujara, Kohli, Rahul and Rahane.
Gurusinha said the biggest difference he saw in the team was in the second innings of the SSC Test where Sri Lanka racked up their highest total of the series so far 386.
The biggest difference I saw was the second innings batting where the application, attitude and the commitment was much better than what they had done in the two innings at Galle and in the first innings at SSC, said Gurusinha.
Thats what we need its the application. Thats what they want and are working towards achieving that. We have to continue that we dont have any choices, thats professional cricket.
Despite the two heavy losses in the first two Tests Gurusinha said the team morale was good.
It is hard work for them they are disappointed as well with the result. They know they have a job to do and they are all working hard towards achieving that. The last innings showed what we can do, the important thing is continuity thats what the players and coaching staff are working towards so that when w go to Pallekele we should continue from where we left at SSC. When you have to field for 600 runs there is so much pressure on the batsmen as well, said Gurusinha.
The whole story would have been different if we had won the toss but we cant depend on it. A lot of things could have been different in both Tests if we had won the toss. That is what you come across in cricket, thats not an excuse or complaint.

Striking growth in Lithuanian tourists to Sri Lanka in 2017
Sri Lanka has witnessed an unprecedented increase of tourists from the pocket-sized Baltic nation, Lithuania, in recent years, according to the Honorary Consulate of Lithuania in Sri Lanka.
A growth of more than 30 percent per year to a destination long been unheard of among Lithuanians, is indeed notable. Moreover, this remarkable achievement has revived prospects for Lithuania  Sri Lanka relations.
Sri Lanka is fast growing as a popular tourist destination among Lithuanian travelers. The Pearl of the Indian Ocean has already achieved substantial growth in tourism in the past few years, especially among European tourists.
However, the popularity of Sri Lanka as a tourist destination among Lithuanians was in a relatively modest stage for many years. The Honorary Consulate of Lithuania in Sri Lanka, in the last two years, has taken necessary steps to uplift this deficit through various projects and plans re-branding Sri Lanka as a top tourist destination among Lithuanians.
The Consulate is pleased to announce that these immense efforts are gradually yielding expected results.
In 2013 and 2014, the Lithuanian travelers to Sri Lanka were 1405 and 1858 respectively, a growth of 32.2%. From 2015 to 2016, the growth was 34.5%, with a total of 2,372 tourists in 2016.
From January to June 2017, the arrivals have depicted a 31.2% growth compared to the same period in 2016. So far in 2017, 1,442 Lithuanian tourists have visited the paradise island and it is expected to grow higher closer to November and December due to the extreme winters in Lithuania.
The growth in the past two years is truly significant, considering the fact that Lithuania is a tiny nation with a mere population of 2.8 million.
Many destinations in Sri Lanka are popular among young Lithuanians, especially for enthusiasts of adventure, water sports and hiking. Many Lithuanians tourists are backpackers who travel around Sri Lanka, relishing the beauty of the island.
Lithuanian Consulate in Sri Lanka Communications Director Kanchana Kodituwakku said, This momentous makeover has complemented the progressive growth of Sri Lankans traveling to Lithuania. Many Sri Lankans travel to Lithuania for tourism, medication, higher studies, investment and jobs. The unique feature of Lithuania to attract Sri Lankans has been chiefly centered on the relatively less cost with high living standards among its European counterparts. Lithuania is ranked among the top countries in Europe for affordable travelling, quality higher education, excellent investment climate and high standards of ICT, Research and Development. In 2016, Lithuania was ranked as the country with the fastest public Wi-Fi in the world.
The Honorary Consulate of the Republic of Lithuania in Sri Lanka will continue to promote tourism, which is a cornerstone in diplomatic, social, political and cultural relations between Sri Lanka and Lithuania.

The Ministers have informed their consent to President Maithripala Sirisena over the decision.
Buddhasana and Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has planned to introduce rules and regulations to ban private tuition classes on Full Moon Poya days and Sundays till 2.00 p.m. for schoolchildren to study dhamma at Sunday Dhamma schools . Since noble human values are disappearing fast, early attention should be paid and possible steps should be taken to foster students towards noble religious teachings of the founders of religions.
Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has held several rounds of talks with leading tuition masters countrywide to discuss the matter.

Switzerland calls SL to leverage Swiss GSP facility
As bilateral trade recorded a huge 65 percent surge, the non-EU but central European nation Switzerland has called Sri Lanka to get on board its historic GSP facility and boost Lankan exports to Swiss market further.
Meanwhile, UNCTAD says that a vast array of products from Sri Lanka including apparels can enter the Swiss market at virtually zero tariffs using the Swiss GSP stream.
Sri Lankan exporters should strive to exploit this facility voiced Ambassador of Switzerland to Colombo Heinz Walker-Nederkoorn recently. Ambassador Walker-Nederkoorn was meeting Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen on July 31 at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.Bilateral trade between Sri Lanka and Switzerland shows a strong short term growth.
Still that could be way below real potentials said Ambassador Walker-Nederkoorn and added: Switzerland is a central European country but is not part of European Union. Still, our own Swiss GSP was implemented in 1971. Sri Lanka is still a beneficiary of a pioneering GSP facility that came in to being at the same time as the EU GSP. Sri Lankan exporters should strive to exploit this facility. Switzerlands economy has a well-developed service sector such as financial services.
Still, Switzerland can take in merchandise products and there is a demand. Exploiting our GSP can help boost your exports and also increase total bilateral trade. Swiss manufacturing industry specializes in high-technology and production.
Minister Bathiudeen, responding to Ambassador Walker-Nederkoorn agreed that present bilateral trade is far below its real potential. I am given to understand that the Swiss GSP was implemented in 1971 at the same time as EU GSP and Sri Lanka too was a pioneering beneficiary of it. Last year our annual trade increased by a very strong 65%. Therefore this is a good time to look at how Lankan exporters can use the Swiss GSP facility. Though Sri Lanka  Swiss bilateral trade is on a growing trend, there are vast unexplored potentials and the GSP facility can help us to overcome them.
According to the Department of Commerce, in 2016 our total exports to Switzerland was US$ 102.23 mn. Interestingly, electronic machinery and electrical controls have been the main items of Lankan exports to Switzerland last yeararound 44 % of our total exports. By using the Swiss GSP, we can expand our export basket with other products including foods, fruits and vegetables as well.
Overall bilateral trade between Switzerland and Sri Lanka leaped by 65 percent to $ 377 million in 2016 (from 2015s $ 229 mn) according to the Department of Commerce. Sri Lankas exports to Switzerland last year was around $ 102 mn, mostly unchanged from 2015s $ 101 Mn. 24% of Lankan exports to Switzerland last year was electronic equipment and another 19% was electrical controls. The third leading Lankan export to Switzerland was diamonds-11% of total exports in 2016.
Among the well-known Swiss investments in Sri Lanka are Nestle, A Baur & Co, Holcim, and Kuehne & Nagel.

Tesla plans to raise $1.5bn to produce new Model 3
US electric car manufacturer Tesla plans to raise $1.5bn (1.15bn) to fund production of its new Model 3 car.
Tesla will raise the money by selling bonds to professional investors, despite the company having $3bn in cash.
The company says it has 518,000 orders for its new car, whose price starts at $35,000.
Initial production of the Model 3 started in July, with a target of 400,000 to be made next year.
Tesla, which also makes batteries and solar panels, has been burning through its cash at a rapid rate.
The company's founder and boss, Elon Musk, said at the vehicle's formal launch in July that making the Model 3 would lead to "six months of manufacturing hell", as it tries to make 100,000 of the cars this year at its California factory.
Some observers have predicted that the company, which has yet to make a profit, will use up at least $2bn this year, hence the need for more cash.
The Tesla bonds will have to be repaid to investors in eight years but the interest rate on offer to investors has not yet been decided.

## Title: Test cricket  four or five days
## Supertitle:

Test cricket  four or five days
The debate on whether Test cricket matches should be made four days will certainly raise its head again going by the current Test series taking place in England and in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka have lost the first two Tests of a three-match series to India inside four days and in Old Blighty barring the third Test between England and South Africa which went the full distance of five days the other three Tests in the four-match series all ended in four days.
There are factors for and against making Test cricket four days. For instance the spate of injuries suffered by cricketers especially bowlers can be reduced if Test cricket is played four days. The bowlers who sometimes have to take on a heavy workload could always do with an extra day off and use it as part of their recovery period between matches.
Consider the injuries that have taken heavy toll on the bowlers of both series that are currently on. South Africa who lost the Test series 3-1 to England didnt have the full services of their key all-rounder Vernon Philander who struggled to make a comeback from an ankle injury and viral ailment. From the Englands side they missed the services of all-rounder Chris Woakes (side strain) and Jake Ball (knee strain). Englands two key bowlers James Anderson missed the Chennai Test against India last December because of body soreness in his ankle and shoulder and Stuart Broad almost didnt nearly make it to the England Test squad against South Africa following a heal injury.
From the Sri Lankan view point they have lost through injuries fast bowlers Suranga Lakmal and Nuwan Pradeep and for the upcoming third Test starting at Pallekele on Saturday their current leading wicket-taker in Test cricket Rangana Herath with a sore back having taken on the burden of bowling 162 overs in the last three Tests against Zimbabwe and India within a period of three weeks.
The advent of Twenty20 cricket has made batsmen score at a helter-skelter rate even in Test cricket so that a team scoring 300-350 runs a day has become quite common. In the ongoing series against Sri Lanka, India scored 399-3 in 90 overs on the first day of the Galle Test and at the SSC they made 344-3 off 90 overs at the end of the first day. In the England-South Africa series, England scored 357-5 in 87 overs on the first day of the first Test at Lords, South Africa 309-6 in 90 on the first day of the second Test at Nottingham, 308 was scored on the second day of the third Test at the Oval and 322 on the second day of the Manchester Test. These figures give an indication how the scoring rates have changed in Test cricket over the past decade or so.
By scoring at such a fast rate  nearly 3 to 4 runs an over, the batting sides are giving their bowlers enough time to bowl the other side out twice inside four days.
Former England Test opener Geoff Boycott said in his Cowdrey Lecture of 2005 for the MCC: We should change to four-day Tests of seven hours each day and we should guarantee 15 overs an hour. Thats 105 overs a day, 420 in a match. A large percentage of games finish inside the allotted time and the 450 overs arent needed. So I think we need to concertina the game, to concentrate the action while losing none of the skills. I can hear players saying, We dont want seven hours, to which Id reply, Well, hang on a minute, in recent times you have been doing seven-hour days because you dont bowl your overs quickly enough.
In a recent interview he said, My views have not changed. I had been doing TV all over the world for TWI from 1990, and I was seeing crowds going down. I think that a sport that doesnt put bums on seats is in serious difficulty. I said the administrators should do something to help. Youngsters want everything quicker. They want a phone, the internet life has always changed, and cricket has always changed. There have been weak administrators. We now have 13 overs an hour. We have five-day Tests, 75 per cent of which finish in four days. You dont need five days.
It goes without saying that Test cricket in Sri Lanka does not draw the crowd that one-day cricket or Twenty20 cricket does. It is nearly the same in Asian countries like India and Bangladesh where one-day cricket draws a larger audience than the five-day game.
However one has to look at the other side of it as well. Four day Tests would mean one less day of broadcasting and could affect the bottom line for all parties. Broadcasters are also becoming irritated with endless shots of half-empty stands, sights that send a not-so-subliminal message to viewers at home that they, too, might find something better to do than watch.
The cricket committee of the ICC had a significant debate on it last year and broadly discussed whether five days had become too long to retain the interest of supporters, sponsors and broadcasters. But no major decision was reached although a recent research has revealed that 41.5 per cent of matches have ended before the fifth day in the last five years. The debate goes on.

University for Policing and Criminal Justice to be established: PM
Setting out the governments plans dedicated to ensuring capacity building of the Police force, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday announced that a University for Policing and Criminal Justice will be established in Sri Lanka. The Prime Minister made the announcement while attending the inauguration ceremony of the Senior Officers Inter Regional Conference on Countering Terrorism and Transnational Crime organised by the INTERPOL along with the Sri Lanka Police at the BMICH yesterday.
Once established, the University will be only the fourth university in the world dedicated to Police and Criminal Justice studies. Currently, only India and South Korea have universities providing studies in Policing the Prime Minister Pointed out.
According to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, while Military education and training in the country has developed rapidly the Police in the last two decades have fallen behind.
Therefore,the university will be the apex body dedicated to the studies on Policing in Sri Lanka, the Prime Minister said adding that the government expects to expand its functions to provide education to qualified individuals across the region. It can be a University for the region, he said.
According to the Prime Minister, the university can be Sri Lankas contribution to the region for combatting terrorism and transnational crime which are becoming more of a Police function today by developing the capacity building of the regions Police forces. The university will also be open for other members of law enforcement such as the customs along with individuals working in the fields of law and criminal justice.
The Premier also said that reforms to laws relating to the Police are now being looked at by the Minister of Law and Order. Sri Lanka Police continues work under the Police ordinance which was ratified 151 years ago, and some provisions are outdated while the rank structure today is not reflected in the Police ordinance, thats how outdated we are, the Prime Minister said. Therefore, while the government is looking towards reforming the Police Ordinance, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also claimed that with the 13th Amendment devolving powers to the Police the authorities are now looking how to reorganise the Police to function along with it.
While speaking about the many challenges faced by the Police force in the modern era due to technology and increased connectivity the Prime Minister also requested the INTERPOL to conduct an audit into the corporation among the Police forces of the region.
We must ensure that the conferences and workshops are increasing the sharing of information and corporations among the Police forces of the region, he said adding that therefore an audit is needed. The inauguration ceremony of the Senior Officers Inter Regional Conference on Countering Terrorism and Transnational Crime organised by the INTERPOL along with the Sri Lanka Police and funded by the Canadian government was held under the patronage of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
The event was also attended by Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka, Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara, INTERPOL officials, Diplomats, Government Officials, foreign delegates and Senior Police officers.
The three-day conference attended by 45 senior police officers representing seven countries will conclude tomorrow.

Vehicle clearance to shift from Htota to Colombo
Vehicle clearance which is being done in Hambantota port is likely to be shifted to the Colombo port, said Ranjan Peiris, the newly appointed President of the Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL).
Peiris said this was revealed on August 3 by Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe at a discussion held in the Ports and Shipping Ministry which was the first meeting he had after taking over as the President of VIASL.
The VIASL President said it was a move in the right direction because the heavy transportation cost can then be reduced and that saving could be passed over to the customer. Here he said they made several proposals to the minister to have a separate huge yard with parking facilities of 2000-3,000 vehicles and security with CCTV cameras etc and separate Customs unit close to the yard in the Colombo Port similarly to the one that exits in the Hambantota Port. Peiris said the minister had also proposed to give office space and required logistics to set up this Customs unit close to the yard.
The VIASL President also requested to provide a tax reduction for hybrid vehicles below 1500 cc and to provide them with a fair valuation system for the vehicles that they import as the current structure was highly unfair on the used car importer.
Hence we beg on behalf of the average Sri Lankan from the government and the local authorities to provide us that opportunity to serve our community. The upcoming budget will provide the perfect platform for the newly appointed Minister of Finance to make this a reality and to provide the average Sri Lankan citizen a quality vehicle that will last a generation and is equipped with suitable safety standards which will be both highly economical and environmentally friendly, he said.
The VIASL President also said that about 90% cars sold in Sri Lanka is on leasing facilities and the restriction by the Central Bank of Loan to Value (LTV) Ratio for motor vehicle loans to 50% had further jolted the already ailing motor industry in Sri Lanka. Peiris said his personal view was that the 50% LTV ratio has become a financial burden to the consumer and has made the dream of purchasing a vehicle unattainable since their preferred ratio is 70%.
Peiris added that increasing the tax on electric cars from 5 percent to 50 percent should be reconsidered in a back drop where European countries that have less sunlight too encourage electric cars and Sri Lanka having sunlight 365 days a year doing otherwise. In a country like Sri Lanka the aim should be to provide and promote facilities to people who were using electric cars and solar power.

VIASL to import compact Japanese cars to beat dropping sales
The motor industry in Sri Lanka today is at a very low edge due to low sales rates, and in a bid to overcome that situation small economical Japanese cars will be imported and introduced to the local market, said Ranjan Peiris the newly appointed President of the Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL).
We should improve this situation by trying to provide a range of quality and economical vehicles to the consumer, particularly quality Japanese domestic vehicles, he said speaking to Daily News Biz Motor.
However the problem that the association is facing is finding small Japanese vehicles to go well with the customs duty valuation method in Sri Lanka. As at now, the local agents of various brands which are mostly owned by foreign subsidiaries are taxed on the valuation provided by the manufacturer as opposed to the used car importer who has to pay a tax based on the maximum retail price mentioned on the manufacturers website the President alleged.
For instance if an identical car is imported by an agent and a used car dealer, for cercain models the agent will be paying a lower import tax as they are being taxed on a valuation provided by the manufacturer, as opposed to the tax a used car dealer would be paying based on the maximum retail price mentioned on the website which is apparantly higher.
Even for a 3-year-old car, the used car dealer is forced to pay an import tax that would have been paid for a brand new model of this nature, hence percentage wise for a 3 year old car we are forced to pay import taxes for almost few times the value of the vehicle, he said.
This is a highly biased and an unfair method of calculating taxes mainly devised to minimize the gap between a brand new vehicle and a used Japanese domestic vehicle. However, the price for this is ultimately paid by the end consumer who should have received the benefit of the lower tax percentage when buying a 3 year old vehicle. Due to this reason the President urged the government to devise a system where agents valuations are being audited in order to gauge the accuracy of the valuation. Used car dealers are only given a 15% discount on the maximum retail price mentioned in the manufacturers website. This however, does not reflect the actual value or the purchase price of the vehicle since the dealer discount in most cases is much more than 15%, and the value of a 3-year-old car is considerably lower.
Peiris said after assuming duties as the President of VIASL a few days ago his idea was to get down small vehicles to cater to the small vehicle market in Sri Lanka which was very much bigger. Although they posses high end Japanese vehicles like Lexus, Toyota, Mitsubishi, Nissan and Honda it was time to think of a smaller vehicle below 1,000 CC where the market share was greater and suits a person just getting to a car from a motor bike or a beginner or a professional like a junior doctor who has just entered the medical field. But if one talks of small vehicles on the road today, they are being used by people who have just started their careers. We are much more concerned about that portion of the market and thinking of how we could cater the general public with a reliable economical and quality vehicle, he said.
Peiris said Japanese domestic vehicles are unmatchable quality wise to any other vehicle in the region and recalled the vehicles imported in the late 70s, the Toyota Hiace which is commonly known by the public as Rukmami Hiace and the Mitsubishi Delica called Udapadel and Yatapadel by the public and the Lancer known as Tubelight Lancer and L Light Lancer, Datsun Sunny called the Batu Sunny. These vehicles were yet used specially in Badulla, Bandarawela, Diyathalawa and Kandy areas for hired transportation and thats ample proof of the high quality of Japanese domestic vehicles in terms of being economical, durable and reliable.
The President emphasized that these vehicles imported in the late 70s had been manufactured to be used in the Japanese domestic market and not for the export market. The vehicles manufactured to be used in the Japanese domestic market were far superior in quality when compared with the vehicles manufactured for the export market by Japanese companies.
Japanese domestic vehicles are also far more superior safety wise with more safety features like air bags, ABS and cutting edge auto brake radar systems. These safety devices that are found in Japanese vehicles cannot be fitted in Sri Lanka just as adding a Hi-Fi stereo to a vehicle, he cautioned.
Especially the most commonly used small vehicles in the region are not equipped with such safety standards and are a road hazard to the driver as well as other motorists on the road. These substandard automobiles are not even equipped with minimum safety standards and not even being provided road license to run in its mother country in certain states. Hence the president urged the government to establish safety standards when importing vehicles to the country which in return will reduce motor accidents.
Sri Lankans are privileged therefore to own a Japanese domestic vehicle which consists of these safety features which cannot be found in most of vehicles manufactured in the other Asian regions. Our main objective is to provide economical, durable and quality range of vehicles to the consumers in Sri Lanka at an affordable price, the President assured.
Furthermore, most of the Japanese domestic models VIASL import are below the 1500 cc engine capacity and are hybrid models. Some of them are plug in hybrids or electric cars with zero emissions and limited use of fossil fuel. In an era where most countries are striving for maximum efficiency the bargaining power of local agents of foreign origin has robbed Lankans of efficient high quality vehicles, he said.
The brand new agents are not being given a quota to import the most commonly used models of each brand. For instance agents are not being given a quota to import the highly efficient and popular Wagon-R Hybrid model, Toyota Axio Hybrid, Toyota Allion, Toyota Premio, Honda Fit Hybrid, Honda Vezel hybrid and Nissan leaf electric, he said.
This is the very fact that the local agents are finding hard to digest and in return they use tactics to make it less attainable to average Sri Lankans. While using marketing tactics with their strong financial stability to misguide customers they use the power of various pressure groups to castle the local authorities to alter the import tax structure to make their products marketable the president alleged For instance most of the vehicles local agents import are non-hybrids and fall in to the 1500 cc  1600 cc category. These are highly inefficient and will one day become a burden to the local economy since we are a country struggling for foreign exchange and the fuel bill accounts to a large proportion of our foreign currency outflow, Peiris said.
Moreover, due to continuous changes that are being made on the tax structure, the used car importers are finding it difficult to maintain a steady flow of business. Despite alerting the authorities about this for unknown reasons the government had been making changes in duty structures and valuations regularly in the past two years which was detrimental to the motor industry in the country. We expect at least now to have some solid system which will stay constant for at least a year from budget to budget, the VIASL President insisted.
The challenge for this years office bearers of VIASL is to ensure that our fellow Sri Lankans receive a vehicle of highest quality equipped with state of the art safety standards at a reasonable price. This is not a dream but a reality if the used car importer is being provided a level playing field with the local agents of foreign origin, the president. MFJ

Words to hear
Chief Overseer of the Apostolic Diocese of Ceylon (ADC), Rev Dr Kirby de Lanerolle is a man of God who believes in a solution based ministry. It is this vision of his that has prompted him to form a relationship with Ven Kolonnawa Narada Thera of Sangaraja Temple. Their goal is simple - Assist the under privileged children of Maradana to aspire for a better life. Poverty is the chief cause of the suffering which we see in society. Daily News visited Rev Kirby de Lanerolle and Ven Narada Thera and learnt about their mission and their plans to help these children.
Rev de Lanerolles objectives are clear cut. It is purely harmonious. He feels that it is the time that Sri Lankan society looks at and understands how the church can play its role in a multi-religious and multi-ethnic society and be a solution. Jesus in his ministry clearly instructed his followers how a church is supposed to be planted. Jesus says in Matthew 10: 14  If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. If they welcome you may stay, but if they do not welcome you then you must leave.
Minority privileges
The first understanding is that Jesus role when he came into the world was not a conversion based ministry. It was a solution based ministry. A Christian should be a solution to that area - a village, city or nation. For me as the leader of the ADC having 500 free churches, my heart is to teach our Christian pastors to live within the privileges of a minority; honouring all religions by serving them without conditions or discrimination. said Rev de Lanerolle.
Rev de Lanerolle feels that as Christians we need to examine our hearts and live in harmony with Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists. Since Jesus came as a king who serves, now most importantly we should do the same. Rev de Kirbys Church WOW was based in Maradana for three years having been introduced to the area and community through his Buddhist classmate Raj Rasiah and during which time they built lasting friendships and impacted many lives in the area. At the onset of WOW moving to Maradana, Rev Kirby de Lanerolles first duty was to meet the other religious leaders (one was Ven Narada Thera) and say  how can I be of service to you.
I want to be a solution and a blessing to the region. If you see and identify that I am a solution to your problems, that my church is a solution to your problems then we will work together. Throughout the years we have grown and we have had a phenomenal relationship. We have grown like brothers and friends and today we are serving a people group from Maradana in whatever way we can explained Rev de Lanerolle.
Fed and educated
Because of this relationship, hundreds of children in Maradana get fed and receive tuition every single day. There was a time when the church and the temple were feeding over hundred people every single day. They want to be a model to other communities. Rev Kirby and Ven Narada Thera have been doing this close to eight years now. Hundreds are getting fed and educated. Scholarships are being given for education  children learn to dance and they learn drama/ theatre. The older kids are placed in jobs. These services were initiated under what is called the Warehouse Project. There have never been misunderstandings between the church and the temple. We love each other and we love the people together. I really believe our free churches can be a solution to this country. They just need the right model, says Rev de Lanerolle.
Rev de Lanerolle stressed that the right model should be servant-hood and love. Those should be its core values. People followed Jesus because they saw love. They loved him because people are naturally attracted to love. Jesus wanted to reveal His Father to the world so that they may know Him as the Father; to reconcile people with the Father. You can easily tell people about Jesus, about the forgiveness and the love he has for people, and the reconciliation he provides through the cross with the Father, and preach the gospel without people being converted from one religion to the other. St Paul himself was a Jew who wrote many books of the New Testament. He wasnt trying to convert people to a religion but introduce them to a living Savior. Jesus is a relationship. He is not a religion. Why cant we introduce Jesus to people without wanting them to convert Gods forgiveness of sins is something any believing man can receive without religious debate and conditions.
The greatest thing is to be a servant and that is essentially what we are trying to do in Maradana. We are serving people, added Rev de Lanerolle.
Faith value
Ven. Narada Thera is a humble Buddhist priest. Both monk and priest honour each others values and their faiths. Both Rev de Lanerolle and Ven Narada Thera saw the movie of the Buddha together. Rev de Lanerolle respects the Buddhist teachings & values. Likewise, Rev de Lanerolle enlightened Ven Narada Thera on many aspects of his faith and in return Ven Narada Thera enlightened Rev de Lanerolle on many aspects of Buddhism.
I understood that Rev de Lanerolle had immense respect for the teachings of the Buddha. He attended some of our Buddhist festivals. Because of this, he grew in my esteem. In return, I grew to respect his faith and his teachings. So we discussed many matters and our friendship deepened. We became brothers. As a Buddhist monk, it is my duty and desire to spread the teachings of the Buddha. I also understood that he too wished to spread the teachings of his faith. Our common goal was service to the people. We wanted to help the people. That is where our teachings found common ground, said Ven. Kolonnawa Narada Thera.
In their years of friendship, there have never been any problems. There has been no conflict.
There has been no dispute. It has been very peaceful and very harmonious. Both parties have one common goal that they strive towards. And that is to do good to society. Along with the Warehouse project, they have also established the Sri Narada Foundation of which Rev de Lanerolle is secretary. Ven. Narada Thera is the Director of Social Welfare work of the Warehouse project. Both have joined hands together. Under the Warehouse project, Rev de Lanerolle is providing a great service to Maradana. The children who are assisted through these endeavours come from Buddhist, Christian, Hindu and Muslim backgrounds. Ven Narada Thera was quick to point out that even the Lord Buddha too was an example of inter-religious harmony. That was part of his character.
Together they have been a conduit of love to all religions and races in Maradana. In a time where united Sri Lanka is forging a new era for the next generation - Progressive religious leaders and mindsets are instrumental for harmonious development.
