Stock market upbeat continues in 2017
The stock market has continued on an upward trend in 2017, where both market indices continued to record positive returns in an encouraging year.
The Benchmark All Share Price Index (ASPI) has made a 2.78% gain in October alone and a 6.31% gain year-to-date, while the S&P SL 20 index, which features the CSEs 20 largest and most liquid stocks has also improved consistently, making a 5.74% gain in October and a 11.50% gain since the start of 2017.
The positive growth of the indices mark a reversal of the declining trend recorded in 2015 and 2016, during which the ASPI recorded a decline of 5.54% and 9.66% respectively. The performance of the market has also resulted in an improved involvement among investors, where the Daily Average Turnover is recorded at Rs. 943 million year-to-date, which is a 28% increase from Rs. 737 million in 2016.
CSE, CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike stated that the foreign activity they have witnessed indicates that international investors have been quick to identify an opportunity in Sri Lankan stocks and with the macro-economic environment continuing to improve we hope to see further advances where secondary market activity is concerned, especially among local retail and institutional investors.
The significant amount of capital raised via rights issues during the year presents another standout feature, with the figure of Rs. 37 billion raised as of end October recording the highest yearly figure since 2007. This development continues to indicate the confidence placed by listed companies in the capital market when addressing their additional capital requirements.
The market has also continued to attract foreign investment throughout 2017, with Rs. 98 billion in foreign buying contributing to a net foreign inflow of Rs. 19.6 billion year-to-date, a figure that is substantial compared to foreign activity in 2015/16. 2017 also recorded an all-time high for foreign investor buying recorded in the first half of a calendar year.
An attractive market valuation (P/E), encouraging performance among listed entities and capital gains tax exemptions offered to share transactions are considered to be defining factors in attracting the level of foreign investor interest the market has witnessed so far in 2017.
In the midst of the growth of the indices and a number of other positives so far this year, the market continues to trade at a discount compared to regional peers and offers further opportunities for investors - with a market P/E recorded at 10.99 as of the end of October.
The CSE through its market development activities has embarked on an awareness drive in 2017, reaching out to multiple investor segments around the country and in international markets.

Texas church shooting leaves at least 26 dead

At least 26 people have been killed after a gunman opened fire at a church during Sunday services, officials say.
The attack happened at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, a small town in Wilson County, Texas.
The gunman, who is reported to have been killed in the aftermath, entered the church and opened fire at around 11:30 local time (17:30 GMT).
Governor Greg Abbott confirmed the death toll and said it was the worst mass shooting in the history of Texas.
"This will be a long, suffering mourning for those in pain," he said at a news conference on Sunday.
Texas Department of Public Safety regional director Freeman Martin said the ages of the victims ranged from 5 to 72 years old.
Authorities said at least 20 people were also injured and taken to hospital.
Martin described the suspect as a young white male in his early 20s, dressed in all black and wearing a ballistic vest as well as tactical-type gear. He was armed with an assault-style rifle.
He began shooting outside the church before he entered and opened fire, Martin said.
A local citizen "grabbed his rifle and began shooting" at the suspect, before the gunman fled in a vehicle.
The citizen pursued the suspect, who drove off the road and crashed his car at the Guadalupe County line.
Police found the suspect dead in his car, but it is unclear if he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound or from returned fire from the citizen, Martin added.
The gunman has been identified as Devin P Kelley, 26, according to US media reports. Police have not confirmed the suspect's identity.
The First Baptist Church's pastor, Frank Pomeroy, has told ABC News that his 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle, was killed in the shooting.
Pomeroy, who was out of town in Oklahoma at the time, described her as "one very beautiful, special child" in a phone call to the television outlet.
At least 10 victims, including four children, were being treated at the University Health System in nearby San Antonio, the hospital said in a tweet.
Sheriff Joe Tackitt said authorities do not know the names of any of the victims yet as they continue to work the crime scene.
Officials said 23 people were found dead inside of the church while two people were fatally shot outside.
Another individual died in hospital, authorities said. One witness, Carrie Matula, told NBC News: "We heard semi-automatic gunfire we're only about 50 yards away from this church.
"This is a very small community, so everyone was very curious as to what was going on."
Sutherland Springs is a small rural community with just a few hundred residents, which lies about 30 miles (50km) southeast of the Texas city of San Antonio.
The San Antonio FBI branch said its agents had been deployed, and there was no indication of the gunman's motive.
The FBI also said that while only one shooter was reported, it was looking into other possibilities.
Photos and video from the scene showed the area sealed off with tape by local law enforcement. A number of helicopters have arrived to transport the wounded, KSAT 12 reporter Max Massey said.
President Donald Trump, on a tour of Asia, condemned the "act of evil" and said Americans would pull together.
"And through the tears and through the sadness, we stand strong, oh so strong," he added. The shooting comes just a month after a gunman in Las Vegas opened fire on an outdoor music festival, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds in the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history.

Top gem experts worldwide joins World Ruby Forum 2017
Gem and jewelry experts from across the globe attended the World Ruby Forum 2017 in Bangkok, Thailand to share their insights on world ruby activities in all dimensions from upstream to downstream. GIT director says that the organization will develop and implement strategies to establish Thailand as the global gem and jewelry trading hub by 2021.
To promote and support the gem and jewelry industry in 2018, the Gem and Jewelry Institute of Thailand (Public Organization) or GIT has set up strategies with specific objectives which includes enhancing the industrys potential to meet international standards, creating new markets, and expanding the marketing and distribution channels, said Duangkamol Jiambutr, Director of GIT.
We are working towards creating a country image to support Thailand as the global gem and jewelry center that will develop customers confidence in the quality and standard of Thai jewelry products. Moreover, GIT is developing and promoting digital marketing channels for the industry while increasing the capability of comprehensive research and innovation development in the gem and jewelry industry.
GIT also maintains our position as the professional organization that coordinates and establishes the cooperation between the public and private sectors both domestically and internationally.
In order to promote Thailands image and the countrys potential to become one of the leading global gem and jewelry trading hubs, GIT and its partners will co-host the World Jewelry Confederation: CIBJO Congress 2017, the largest annual meeting for the world gem and jewelry industry, from November 2 to 7 at Shangri-La Hotel, Bangkok with around 350 domestic and international participants expected to attend the congress.
Moreover, the CIBJO Congress 2017 will be held in conjuction with the World Ruby Forum, which was took place at the same venue on November 4.

Trending among elites and commoners
He has been known as a wordsmith but the lyrical side of senior journalist Saman Athaudahetti has mostly been in the dark. Now the poet in him has been brought to light via a book of lyrics penned by the lyricist. Titled Why Were You a Flower Untouchable Yet So Fragrant (Malak Une Ei Nuba Mata), the book comprises the most well known lyrics written by Athaudahetti.
Another book authored by Athaudahetti, Wandering with Pleasure Along the Roof of the Universe (Sakwala Piyasa Dige), the fourth book in a series of the Beauty of Travel publications, too was launched at the event. The official launch of this book was held in China and Japan last month.
The book which was written in Sinhala language is his second on China. It features detailed information on history, culture, religion and social development of southwest Chinas Tibet Autonomous Region as well as his travels in east Chinas Shandong Province. His first book on China was Wandering with Pleasure along the Silk Road Route. It was published in 2012.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Ministers Sagala Ratnayake and Gayantha Karunathilake graced the book launch which was held at the BMICH. Speaking at the event Prof Sunil Ariyaratne said that readers got to know about the real picture of modern China through Athaudahettis Wandering with Pleasure along the Silk Road Route.
Athaudahetti is a well known media personnel, poet, song writer and the Additional Media Secretary to the Prime Minister. He has traveled in China extensively. He went to Tibet in 2007 and 2016 and stayed there for almost a month. During his trip to Lhasa and Shigatse in Tibet, he had a chance to encounter the people and the local family life. Such experiences have enriched his two books on China.
However, these two books are poles apart. Wandering with Pleasure along the Silk Road Route is very entertaining while Wandering with Pleasure Along the Roof of the World is more towards the political side. The most important lesson he brings forth in this book is the straight actions that the present Chinese President has taken to combat theft and bribery. It was a thought he had been harnessing before he came to power and once he became the president, he was true to his word. Athaudahetti witnessed the steps which were taken against all those who engaged in theft and bribery during his stay in China.
The law for such acts is passed by political science and law management degree holders. Apart from combating bribery and theft, steps have been undertaken to stop further acts of theft and bribery from occurring in the future. The public is being educated to eliminate such actions. The Chinese president also got the maximum support from the media to put his plans to actions, Prof Ariyaratne said.
He noted that another striking aspect of the system is that the public was able to call a hotline and complain about any personal or official problems they had. Around 200 call centres had been established to receive the calls and solve these issues. The centres received around 6000 problems to solve each day. If the issue cannot be solved immediately they would ask for a span and then give an answer as a means of solving the issue.
They have set a record by solving 60 lakhs public issues since 2008. Many official and unofficial NGOs exist in China. The Chinese government believes that issues like poverty, environmental pollution, the energy crisis and other social issues can be solved with the help of NGOs, Prof Ariyaratne said.
Seasoned lyricist Kularatne Ariyawansa said that Athaudahettis role as media personnel has outshone his role as a lyricist.
The Sinhala literary scene has suffered a great loss due to this reason. However, Athaudahetti has finally done a certain amount of justice to himself by launching Why Were You a Flower Untouchable Yet So fragrant, he said adding that Athaudahetti still has the capacity to fulfill poetry enthusiasts requirements and enrich the local literature with more songs.
Athaudahetti has penned many well known lyrics including Sunil Edirisinghes Kavurunda Oba Mage, Amarasiri Peiris Malak Une Ei Nuba Mata and Iri Thalunu Vala Udu Viyan Yatin Mudu Tharuka Athirille, Gunadasa Kapuges Kavuruth Ennathi Kavuruth Dannathi Malpethi Ihirunu Mal Paare, Malini Bulathsinhalas Akikaru Himiyane Mavak Se Rakimi Oba and Athula Adikaris Silara Sitha Nayana.
Though he has penned many timeless lyrics Athaudahetti has little concern about making himself public when his work becomes a hit.
That is his nature. Though he has worked closely with one of the most prominent political leaders in the nation for 26 years, nobody has pointed a finger at him. He has trodden with the elites yet not lost his common touch, soprano Kishani Jayasinghe expressed.

Type 3c diabetes misdiagnosed
Most people are familiar with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Recently, though, a new type of diabetes has been identified as type 3c diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes is where the bodys immune system destroys the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. It usually starts in childhood or early adulthood and almost always needs insulin treatment. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas cant keep up with the insulin demand of the body. It is often associated with being overweight or obese and usually starts in middle or old age, although the age of onset is decreasing.
Type 3c diabetes is caused by damage to the pancreas from inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), tumours of the pancreas, or pancreatic surgery. This type of damage to the pancreas not only impairs the organs ability to produce insulin but also to produce the proteins needed to digest food (digestive enzymes) and other hormones.
However, our latest study has revealed that most cases of type 3c diabetes are being wrongly diagnosed as type 2 diabetes.
Small studies in specialist centres have found that most people with type 3c diabetes need insulin and, unlike with other diabetes types, can also benefit from taking digestive enzymes with food. These are taken as a tablet with meals and snacks.
Researchers and specialist doctors have recently become concerned that type 3c diabetes might be much more common than previously thought and that many cases are not being correctly identified. It was found that in adults, type 3c diabetes was more common than type 1 diabetes. One per cent of new cases of diabetes in adults were type 1 diabetes compared with 1.6 per cent for type 3c diabetes.
People with type 3c diabetes were twice as likely to have poor blood sugar control, than those with type 2 diabetes. They were also five to 10 times more likely to need insulin, depending on their type of pancreas disease.
The onset of type 3c diabetes could occur long after the onset of pancreas injury  in many cases more than a decade later. This long lag may be one of the reasons the two events are not often thought of as being linked, and the diagnosis of type 3c diabetes is being overlooked.
Correctly identifying the type of diabetes is important as it helps the selection of the correct treatment. Several drugs used for type 2 diabetes such as gliclazide may not be as effective in type 3c diabetes. Misdiagnosis, therefore, can waste time and money attempting ineffective treatments while exposing the patient to high blood sugar levels. Our findings highlight the urgent need for improved recognition and diagnosis of this surprisingly common type of diabetes.

Unruly waves under check
ESSO-Indian National Centre For Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Hyderabad established in 1999 is an autonomous Society under Indias Earth Services Ministry. INCOIS which is considered as one of the best Ocean Information services centres in the world is mandated to provide the best possible ocean information and advisory services to society, industry, government agencies and the scientific community. Its major functions include issuing early warnings on tsunami, storm surge, high wave alerts to disaster management agencies, ports and harbour, and coastal population; issuing advisories to fishermen on potential fishing zones; Ocean state forecasting and providing special services for Indian Navy and Coast Guard. INCOIS state-of-the-art Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre is one of the best Tsunami Service Providers responsible for providing tsunami services to the Indian Ocean rim countries (23 countries) including Sri Lanka. The centre which is in direct contact with Sri Lankas Meteorological Department, is a permanent member of UNESCOs Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.
INCOIS Director Dr. Satheesh C. Shenoi talks to the Daily News on topics ranging from INCOIS future projects and its role as a tsunami early warning centre in the region to disaster management in Sri Lanka including tsunami preparedness.
Q: ESSO-INCOIS which was established in 1999 provides round-the-clock monitoring and warning services for the coastal population on tsunamis, storm surges, high waves. However, tsunami wreaked havoc across South East Asia in 2004. How prepared were you back then to handle such situations Were you able to issue tsunami early warnings
A: Yes, INCOIS was established in 1999 with the mandate to provide ocean information and services to all stakeholders from fishermen to highly qualified professionals such as researchers, academicians, Coast Guard and Navy. Unfortunately, because the tsunami was not expected or never heard to occur in the Indian Ocean, tsunami early warning systems were not included in the activities of INCOIS at that time. However, when the large earthquake that led to the generation of devastating tsunami in the Indian Ocean struck on December 26, 2004, the government realised the importance of having an early warning centre for tsunami and that time, INCOIS was asked to take up the work and install one.
Today, we have a fully functional tsunami warning centre consisting of a network of earthquake monitors, tsunami wave monitors, etc. It is functional at INCOIS and is manned 24 hours. With such facilities, we are fully capable of detecting the earthquakes occurring anywhere in the world, especially in the Indian Ocean, within three to six minutes and issuing the bulletins within 8-10 minutes of the occurrence of an earthquake. The centre is also capable of detecting and reporting the tsunami waves within 20 minutes.
Q: How successful has the National Tsunami Early Warning Centre been in issuing early warnings (tsunami, storm surge and high wave alerts) and detecting earthquakes in the recent past What are its main functions
A: Realising the devastative potential of tsunamis, the Indian government directed the Earth Sciences Ministry to set up an early warning system at the earliest possible time at INCOIS. The National Tsunami Early Warning Centre (ITEWC), set up at INCOIS, has been operational since October 2007 and issues accurate tsunami advisories for all under-sea earthquakes of M = 6.5. Established a decade ago as an interim tsunami warning centre, it has become a world-class tsunami warning centre in no time, with a real-time network of seismic stations, tsunami buoys, sea level gauges and 24 X 7 operational warning centre to detect tsunamigenic earthquakes, to monitor sea-level changes and to provide timely advisories to vulnerable communities.
The state-of-the-art Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre acts not only as a national nodal agency for tsunami advisories, but also as one of the Tsunami Service Providers responsible for providing tsunami services to the Indian Ocean rim countries (23 countries). Since its inception, the Centre has detected 475 earthquakes of M > 6.5 in the world oceans and 68 earthquakes in the Indian Ocean and issued appropriate warnings/advisories to the concerned authorities. To date no earthquake has neither gone undetected, nor ended up in issuing inappropriate tsunami warning. Also, the centre has always maintained the standards specified by IOC/UNESCO.
Q: How are tsunami early warnings issued
INCOIS Director Dr. Satheesh C. Shenoi
A: The Warning Centre disseminates tsunami advisories to various stakeholders through multiple dissemination modes simultaneously (Fax, Phone, Emails, GTS and SMS etc.). Earthquake information, tsunami bulletins as well as real-time sea level observations are also made available on a dedicated website www.tsunami.incois.gov.in for officials, public and media. Users can also register on the website for receiving earthquake alerts and tsunami bulletins through emails and SMS. The ITEWC also assists the coastal states through education programmes and regular tsunami communication and evacuation exercises, increasing the coordination, readiness for understanding of tsunamis among stakeholders with special emphasis on school children and other coastal communities around the nation.
Warning Centre is constantly evolving with new strategies by focussing its efforts towards the development of new methodologies and warning procedures. The future work is focussed towards sea level inversion, real-time inundation modelling, use of near-field GPS measurements for real-time rupture characterisation and 3D mapping of vulnerable coastal areas.
Q: How does a tsunami warning system work
A: The tsunami early warning system starts with the identification of the earthquake occurred at the bottom of the sea/ocean, estimation of its location, magnitude, depth inside the earth, etc. Once the earthquake is identified as high magnitude earthquake, our centre makes use of a mathematical model of tsunami wave propagation and determines whether that earthquake is capable of generating a tsunami and if so what are the expected tsunami wave heights all along the coast and when they are likely to reach. Based on that calculation, we issue the next bulletin if we find the estimated wave heights exceeds 2.0 m, at one or more locations (a location covers 50 km stretch of the coast). We issue the second bulletin informing about the likely tsunami and the locations where that might come under tsunami waves. The first bulletin is issued within 8-10 minutes, the second bulletin with tsunami information is issued within 15-20 minutes. By the time we issue the second bulletin, the tsunami waves, if produced, travels and reaches one or other tsunami buoy or a sea level gauge that is reporting data to INCOIS continuously and that information tells us whether a tsunami has been generated. That gives us the confirmatory message as well as the opportunity to provide more accurate tsunami information in the subsequent bulletins. This is the sort of procedure that we follow. Though seemingly simple, the issues are very complicated, like the quickness in the estimation of earthquake details, estimations using a tsunami model, reception of data from the sensors scattered all over, maintenance of those observing system, communication channels, etc.
Q: One of the main objectives of INCOIS is to carry out surveys and acquire information using satellite technology. How are Indian and American satellites used to obtain data
A: Rather than carrying out surveys, our objective is in utilising the data gathered from in situ (the sensors out at oceans) and remote sensing satellites to derive information. For example, we use the data from satellites to produce the Potential Fishing Zone advisories that inform the fishermen where they can expect abundant fish. Similarly, we assimilate the data from satellites as well as from the in situ platforms in the mathematical models that we use to forecast the sea state during next five to seven days. To receive the data from Indian (Oceansat) as well as American satellites, we have three ground stations on our campus.
Q: In which ways does INCOIS provide its services to its nearest Southern neighbour, Sri Lanka
A: We do issue tsunami early warnings and ocean state forecasts to Sri Lanka.
The north-west coast of Sri Lanka is most of the time under the influence of high wind waves and swell waves, the situation getting compounded during the spring tides, particularly along the low lying areas. The country has also been affected mostly by cyclone activity occurring in the Bay of Bengal. Even though not frequent, the eastern, northern and north central regions have been identified as cyclone-prone areas of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is also under the influence-high winds and waves associated with the southwest monsoon season. There is an urgent need to provide timely and accurate forecast information on ocean state and marine meteorological parameters for a wide spectrum of users such as fishermen, ports and harbours, tourism departments, defence, coast guard and shipping for this island country with a relatively long coastline.
To cater to these needs, Earth Sciences Ministry of the Indian government developed an integrated high resolution ocean forecasting system for Sri Lanka through INCOIS and Regional Integrated Multi-hazard Early-warning Systems (RIMES). The forecast is available to the users three days in advance at three to six hour temporal resolution for wind, waves, currents, the temperature in map form for the region.
These forecasts are updated daily on operational basis. In addition, location-specific forecast products are available for the following locations; Kalpitiya, Chilaw, Negombo, Dikkovita, Mutwal, Panadura, Beruwala, Ambalangoda, Hikkaduwa, Dodanduwa, Galle, Mirissa, Puranawella, Nilwella, Kudawella, Tangalle, Hambantota, Kirinda, Valachchanai, Cod Bay, Oluvil and Suduwella.
Most of these locations are fishing harbours.
Further, High Wave Alerts would be issued during situations when the waves are likely to be high, close to the shoreline. Development of Standard Operating Procedure for providing High Wave Alerts, tidal flooding and wave surge warning is in progress.
Q: ESSO-INCOIS has a prominent international presence, being a permanent member of the Indian delegation to IOC of UNESCO and a founding member of the Indian Ocean Global Ocean Observing System (IOGOOS) and the Partnership for Observing the Oceans (POGO). What role does INCOIS play as a permanent member of UNESCOs Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission
A: As a member of IOC/UNESCO, we do help the other members in collaborating with us, in building their capacity, engage in training programmes, etc. The ocean state forecasts and tsunami early warnings that we are providing to other countries is another example. We offer free training to other countries in operational oceanography through the courses that we organise at the International Training Centre for Operational Oceanography (ITCOocean). If I remember correct, we must have trained about 15-20 participants from Sri Lanka during the last three to four years.
Q: A recent study conducted by the Guardian, UK convincingly quantified how much the Earth has warmed over the past 56 years. Earths oceans are warming 13% faster than thought, and accelerating, the new data revealed. This can definitely affect sea levels, coastlines, ocean acidification, ocean currents, seawater, sea surface temperatures, and trigger many changes in ocean bio-geochemistry. How sensitive is INCOIS to these changes Do you conduct researches on these areas
A: We have conducted limited studies on these aspects, but now we are proposing a new project on the aspects of climate change to the Indian government. Basically, we want to understand the accelerated warming of Indian Ocean, how that is going to affect the future sea level, biogeochemistry, etc and see whether we can make long-term predictions on such changes.
Now we are in the process of brainstorming and preparing a detailed project report for its submission to Earth Sciences Ministry of the Indian government by the end of November. The proposal will undergo an independent scrutiny by experts and that process might take a couple of months and later the financial approvals. If everything goes well, we are expecting to get the approvals in April-June 2018. The results are expected to start from the third year of the project.
Q: It is said that sea waves and precipitation patterns have changed dramatically over the years. Do you find major changes in the wave patterns of the Indian Ocean of late
A: Yes, our preliminary studies suggest that the wave heights have increased over a period of time and the Indian Ocean is warming at a larger rate than other oceans. Some of our research, as well as the research papers, appeared in the research journals from elsewhere are suggesting the transfer of heat from the Pacific to Indian Ocean (IO) through the Indonesian region. But the questions remain whether it is true that IO is warming at a higher rate because of the accelerated transfer of heat from Pacific. If so, what is causing that acceleration How much heat is getting transferred What would be the fate of that excess heat getting accumulated in the IO How will that heat influence the sea level, weather, climate and biogeochemistry of the IO Whether there is an increase in waves If so whether that is happening all over the IO or only at a few locations What could be the reasons for such an increase Finally, we want to use mathematical models to reproduce these observations and extend them further to predict the changes over next decades. These are the kind of issues we are trying to address in the new project that we are proposing.
Q: One of your activities is training and capacity-building for students, young researchers in India and Indian Ocean Rim Countries through short and long duration training courses. Whats the enrolment procedure
A: Enrolment procedure is simple. We announce the forthcoming courses on our website (http://www.incois.gov.in/ITCOocean/index.jsp) as well as through emails to the contacts calling for applications. Based on the course content and the basic qualification and nature of work of the applicant, a committee selects the participants.
Q: As a responsible body that conducts systematic quality checks and carries out research on the patterns and trends in ocean health, what predictions can you make about the changing weather patterns, oceans and its motion
A: India Meteorological Department under MoES is the responsible agency to make the predictions of weather and INCOIS is responsible for providing information about the changes that are happening in the oceans, namely ocean state forecasts. Right now we are predicting the changes in the oceans up to seven days in advance using the ocean models forced with forecasted atmospheric parameters. If the forecasted atmospheric parameters (winds, heat fluxes) are available for longer periods, we too will be able to provide the forecasts of ocean state for longer periods.
Q: Is another tsunami in the offing There are certain reports in the web which say that a large earthquake will strike in the Indian Ocean and cause a deadly tsunami before the end of 2017. Can a tsunami be predicted before an earthquake happens
A: There are no scientific evidence to support such reports. As such no tsunami can be predicted before the occurrence of earthquakes. We are fully prepared to predict the tsunamis when a large earthquake occurs on the seafloor.
Q: INCOIS is considered as one of the best Ocean Information Services Centres in the world. Based on your expertise, what are your recommendations for Sri Lanka with regard to disaster management, early warning systems and potential fishing zones
A: Disaster management is as important as the early warnings. Hence, it is necessary to prepare detailed disaster management plans involving the civil administration and community. To prepare the disaster management plans it would be necessary to assess the risk of vulnerable localities on the coast.
Regarding the potential fishing zones, certainly, it would be beneficial to adopt the technologies to generate such advisories. We will be happy to impart training in these areas.
Q: Has Sri Lanka identified such vulnerable localities on the coast Have the authorities sought your advice in this regard Can you name such vulnerable localities on the coasts of Sri Lanka
A: As I understand, some work in that direction has been done in Sri Lanka, but I have no idea on how far that has been done. I had opportunities to listen to Professor Sam Hettiarachchi of Moratuwa University at some of the meetings about the tsunami risk assessments carried out in Sri Lanka.
Of course, if vulnerable areas are identified, a detailed plan of action including evacuation plans, safer routes for evacuation, how link departments should act during an emergency, etc. should be prepared. More importantly, such communities should be educated about the risk and what they should do in such eventuality. Periodic mock exercises involving the community will be a good option to prepare the community to face the eventualities and also to keep the entire civil administration well oiled.
Q: What are the main issues faced by fishermen both in India and Sri Lanka
A: The major problems faced by the Indian fishermen are low catches, higher expenses in fishing and timely sale of catch at competitive prices. Second is the safety at sea due to bad seas. The PFZ advisories and ocean state forecasts provided to the Indian fishermen addresses both the issues to a large extent. I guess the problems faced by the Sri Lankan fishermen are also similar.

Use petrol sparingly: Minister
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga requested the public to use petrol sparingly until the situation normalises by Wednesday.
Long queues were seen outside filling stations in and around Colombo for the third day yesterday, as the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) struggled to meet the petrol demand that shot up suddenly due to panic buying.
Oil bowsers were dispatched from the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminal in Kolonnawa to filling stations in various parts of the country from yesterday morning despite it being a holiday.
CPC sources said the usual consumption of petrol, which is about 2,000 MT per day, had doubled in the last three days as panicked consumers started stocking up petrol.
Many filling stations were closed and some stations restricted issuing petrol as the stocks ran out very fast. No shortage of diesel, kerosene and jet fuel was reported.
Fears of petrol shortage were driven by the rejection of a fuel shipment imported by the Lanka Indian Oil Company.
The shipment that arrived in the country on October 15 was rejected as it failed to meet the required standards.
Another shipment of fuel ordered by the CPC from UAE was delayed by several days. The CPC sources said that ship carrying 30,000 MT of fuel will arrive in the country by Wednesday.
Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Trade Union Collective Convener D.J. Rajakaruna writing to Minister Ranatunga over the fuel shortage on Saturday reiterated the need to develop the storage capacity of the CPC to maintain sufficient buffer stocks.

Watery grave for eight in Laggala
The members of two families who went bathing in the Thelgamuwa Oya in Laggala in Matale, faced tragedy when eight of them died after been swept by a current on November 4 afternoon.
Laggala Police said the dead included four children, two males and two females.
The dead are a tourist hotel owner named Kingsley Ratnayake (40) his two daughters Ratnayake Mudiyanselage Chitrani Ratnayake (12), Ratnayake Mudiyanselage Hiruni Dilhara Ratnayake (4) his aunt Manawitage Chandrakanthi (59), other family members Uduwarage Ravindra Wasantha (38) his wife Jayamaha Archchige Ramani Dilrukshi (37) and their daughters Uduwarage Krishan Wanisha (12) and Udwanage Imasha Widusha (7).
Kingsley Ratnayake who is building a hotel at Etanwala had visited the area with his family and a friends family on November 3 morning. Kingsleys wife Dulka Marasinghe said the two families later went for a bath in the Thelgamu Oya at a spot called Wedda Peri Ella.
When they ventured into the Oya the water was upto only knee level. But, suddenly a high tide gushed in and swept away some of the people while three managed to survived by huddling together. After hearing their cries for help, the people in the area had rushed in to search for the missing people.
They were later joined in by Laggala Police and life saving teams. The bodies of five persons were retrieved by the search parties by November 4 evening. Search operations were continuing to find the bodies of the missing three children.
Dumbara Mithuro Environmental Organisation president Nimal Kanaheraarachchi commenting on the tragedy said Wedda Peri Ella is a popular halting spot among local and foreign tourists.
The lack of any warning signs or boards about the unexpected danger involved in the high water level led to such loss of valuable lives, he said.

We will make people inheritors of solutions - Minister Sagala
Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said the governments vision was to make people inheritors of solutions rather than making them inheritors of problems.
We have made efforts to resolve land issues faced by the people in the Matara district for decades. We have offered them a solution by giving title deeds. If we rescue them from the land issue, that will, in return, ensure their economic stability and well being, the Minister said, while addressing an event in Deniyaya yesterday (5), to present title deeds to nearly 4,000 people in the area.
The event took place under the auspices of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Land Reforms and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunathilake was also present.
When we assumed office, we gave various promises to the people. We, as a government, have not forgotten those promises. As we move forward, we will deliver on our promises, one by one. The initiative to resolve land issues is one such example, the Minister said.
We also promised to stabilise tea prices. We delivered on that promise as well. Now, tea cultivators have got a stable price and our efforts have paid off, Ratnayaka added.
The Minister, however, said the economy of the district should not fully depend on tea.
We need to broad-base our avenues of income.The tourism industry offers some good opportunities to the district. We will pursue them in the near future.
The economy of the southern province will also be strengthened by the development of the Hambantota Port, the Minister said, adding that the government had already fast-tracked the development programmes in the Hambantota district.
Our initial task was to create a safe and stable environment for everyone in the country.
We have fulfilled that task over the last two and a half years and now it is time to move towards economic prosperity, he said.

Price reduction in essential medicines
WHO lauds Government
The Sri Lankan Government decreased the prices of 48 essential medicines on October 21, 2016 and issued an Extraordinary Gazette notification in this regard, `Sri Lankas success: Ensuring affordable essential medicines for all published by the World Health Organization (WHO) says.
Medicines for non communicable diseases (NCDs) - diabetes, heart diseases, high blood pressure and high cholesterol among other diseases were reduced in this way, it says.
The Sri Lankas pharmaceutical market earns USD $ 400 million per year. The revised drug price formula introduced in 2016 ensures that the public have essential medicines at low prices. Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said the prices of certain drugs could be reduced up to 85 percent, the publication says.
The revised pricing policy is a major achievement in safeguarding patients rights to access affordable medicine in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankas successful regulation of pharmaceutical prices shows how evidence based policies can protect patients rights, ensure affordable access to quality assured medicines and advance the principles of Universal Health Coverage, the publication points out.
Technical analysis, high level advocacy and public debate prompted the Extraordinary Gazette issued by the Government of Sri Lanka to put a ceiling on the price of 48 essential medicines, the publication says.

For the wild at heart, kept in cages
She is one of Hollywoods leading actresses, she is an Oscar winner and she adorns the red carpet like the brightest jewel of Americas film industry. But, beneath all that glitter and glamor, she is also compassionate, loving, resilient, and a survivor.
Angelina Jolie, filmmaker, philanthropist and dashing radiance of the big screen who built herself up through darkness and difficulty. She won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Girl, Interrupted in 2000 and has received two Screen Actors Guild Awards and three Golden Globe Awards and has been cited as Hollywoods highest paid actress. She became the youngest person ever to receive the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 2014.
Bound to darkness
Born on June 4, 1975, Jolie comes from a background of artists. Her parents, Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand and her brother James Haven are actors whereas her uncle James Voight was a singer/song writer, better known as Chip Taylor.
Following the separation of her parents, Jolie and her brother lived with their Mother who abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.
Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she reportedly felt isolated among the children of some of the areas affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income.
Around the age of 11, she was bullied by other students for being too thin and for wearing glasses and braces. She was emotionally broken and began to show self-destructive behavior. I always felt caged, closed in, like I was punching at things that werent there, the actress once told dailymail.co.uk.
Her early attempts at modeling, at her mothers insistence, proved unsuccessful. She was being rejected again and again for being too thin and too gloomy.
At Moreno High School, an alternative school, she became a punk outsider, wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing and dropping out of her acting classes. As reported in people.com, at the time, she was aspired to become a funeral director, taking at-home courses to study embalming.
At 16, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies.
She was nineteen when she found herself, again, suffering from depression which led to drug abuse and two suicide attempts.
However, she found stability in life when she adopted her first son, Maddox. Its strange; I never wanted to have a baby. I never wanted to be pregnant. I never babysat. I never thought of myself as a mother, Jolie said to dailymail.co.uk. But as she was shooting Tomb Raider in the year 2000, playing with children at a Cambodian school, it became suddenly very clear to me that my son was in the country, somewhere.
Finding success in Hollywood
Jolies first breakthrough in her acting career came when she portrayed supermodel GiaCarangi in HBOs Gia (1998).In 1999, Jolies supporting role of a sociopathic mental patient in Girl, Interruptedmarked Jolies final breakthrough in Hollywood. While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, it was Jolie who captured most praise, secured her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
For Variety, American film critic Emanuel Levy noted, Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susannas rehabilitation.
Being the light of the needy
Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world. After much dedicated endeavors, made for the sake of many refugees, in August 2001, Jolie was named a UNHCR goodwill ambassador for refugees.
Jolie has pushed for legislation to aid child immigrants and other vulnerable children in both the US and developing nations, including the Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2005. Since October 2008, she has co-chaired Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a network of leading US law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the US.
In April 2012, Jolie was promoted to special envoy for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees after serving as a goodwill ambassador to the UNHCR for more than ten years.
In the same year, Jolie fronted a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. She also launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with the then English Foreign Secretary William Hague. In June 2014, Angelina led the worlds biggest anti-rape summit in London when she hosted the Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict.
A beautiful mother

In 2007, Jolie adopted Pax from Vietnam when he was three years old. In July, 2008, she, again, had twins, Knox Lon and Vivienne Marcheline with Pitt.
Last year, Jolie announced her decision to file for divorce from her husband Pitt after two years of marriage and 12 years together which stirred up quite a shock among her fans as the couple was adored throughout the globe by millions.
Making films
Jolie took on a painful and complex subject for her directorial debut, which she filmed in 2010. In the Land of Blood and Honey followed the story of the Bosnian War and the brutal crimes against women that took place during the conflict. In 2017, Jolie directed First They Killed My Father, a biographical historical thriller film.
Cancer prevention treatment
After learning she had an 87 per cent risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene, Jolie revealed her brave decision to undergo a preventive double mastectomy in an op-ed article she wrote for The New York Times in May 2013.
She shared her story, I wanted to write this to tell other women that the decision to have a mastectomy was not easy. But it is one I am very happy that I made. On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.
A tattoo on her left arm reads: A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages. For she, indeed, felt caged as a child. But she did set herself free. In an interview with daily mail, pointing out bodywork on her arm  one of her 13 tattoos  she said: The wild heart caged. I unlocked my cage years ago. I want my children to have that freedom. I want that for other people, too.

Dictators dont scare US: Trump
JAPAN: President Donald Trump warned on Sunday that no dictator should underestimate the United States, as he launched an Asia tour that will be dominated by the North Korea nuclear crisis.
Speaking to cheering military personnel at Yokota Air Base just west of Tokyo, Trump donned a bomber jacket and issued a threat that no one, no dictator, no regime and no nation should underestimate... American resolve. Every once in a while in the past, they underestimated us. It was not pleasant for them, was it roared Trump.
We will never yield, never waver and never falter in defence of our people, our freedom and our great American flag. Trumps marathon trip comes with the North Korea crisis at fever pitch, as US bombers fly sorties over the Korean peninsula and fears mount of another Pyongyang missile test.
According to the Washington Post, Pentagon officials have warned that the only way to locate and secure North Koreas nuclear weapons sites would be via a ground invasion.
The Presidents first stops are Japan and South Korea -- frontline US allies in the effort to force Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear programme, and the two countries with most to fear should a full-scale conflict break out.
Trump touched down under clear blue Tokyo skies and stepped out with his wife Melania in bright sunshine to greet the crowds.
Speaking to reporters on the plane, he announced he would likely be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin during the tour, as the international community scrambles for a solution to the North Korean crisis.
I think its expected well meet with Putin, yeah. We want Putins help on North Korea, and well be meeting with a lot of different leaders, said Trump.
He added that North Korea was a big problem for our country and for the world, and we want to get it solved but had kind words for the people in the hermit state.
I think theyre great people. Theyre industrious. Theyre warm, much warmer than the world really knows or understands. Theyre great people. And I hope it all works out for everybody, he said. Abe has emerged strengthened from a crushing victory in a snap election and has firmly supported Trump in his policy of exerting maximum pressure on Kim, backed up with the threat of military force.
I want to further cement the bond of the Japan-US alliance, based on our relations of trust and friendship with President Trump, Abe said as Trump arrived.
Trump for his part described Japan as a treasured partner and crucial ally of the US. Trump only has to play golf in Japan, as he knows Japan will follow (the US) whatever happens. Everything has been sorted out beforehand, Tetsuro Kato, political scientist at Tokyos Hitotsubashi University, told AFP.
After Japan, Trump travels to Seoul, where his relationship with President Moon Jae-in is noticeably cooler. From Seoul, Trump travels to China to meet his counterpart Xi Jinping who, like Abe, has solidified his grip on power after being handed a second term. - AFP

Alien themed bar
The iconic horror-scifi Alien still haunts many of us to this day. From the ominous environment to the design of the alien itself, a huge part of the terror comes from the design of the films world. And the artist that we have to thank for the scaly, bony look of the title creature is Swiss designer H.R. Giger, who, since 1998, has showcased some of his greatest works in his own museum located in Switzerland.
One room of the museum, known as the H.R. Giger Bar, has been designed with many similarities to his work on the Ridley Scott film. And while many have not had the opportunity to experience it, photographer Matthias Belz has posted a 360 photograph of the bar, transporting us into the space as if we were there.
The room, as described by Gigers website, is a cavernous, skeletal structure covered by double arches of vertebrae that crisscross the vaulted ceiling of an ancient castle. Complemented by equally as intimidating, sleek and dark furniture, the design is so evocative of Alien that it feels like it should exist in that world.

[APPRECIATIONS - (06-11-2017)]
David E. P. A. Senevirathne
He was a beacon of light
Since its inception, the tapestry of the cooperative movement in Sri Lanka has been studded with many a precious gem. The late David Senevirathne was veritably one of them. His dedication and devotion to the cooperative movement is indescribable. The writer is compelled by obligation to pen a few lines in appreciation on this colossus on behalf of his fellow villagers before his third month remembrance. In fact, writing on him is writing about the genesis of the concept of cooperative living in this locality of Baddegama, a few miles away from the city of Galle on the southern tip of Sri Lanka.
For me, the late David Senevirathne, popularly known as 'Senevirathne mahathmaya,' was invariably a father figure and a beacon light in my formative years of emotional development. In the dark years, he was the lighthouse that regulated social navigation. How he commanded this recognition is an exemplary saga for the young prodigies of the village to emulate. My appreciative diction would propel the young generation to tread his path and contribute for the uplift of not only the cooperative movement in the southern province, but also the social fabric in which he thrived and served, I humbly believe.
The late E. P. A. Senevirathnes lineage itself commands social recognition. His parents hail from Welipenna Copi Watta Walawwa in Matugama. The famous idiom burn midnight oil is quite applicable to his long way to success in education. The bottle lamp, now almost a thing of the past, illuminated his life. He had his elementary education at G/Weihena Primary School in Baddegama and later, he entered G/Suduwelipotha Junior School for his secondary education. It was the golden period of national revival and DR. G. G. Malalasekara and other Sinhala veterans had come forward to re-establish the pristine glory of our indigenous culture. The late E. P. A. Senevirathne joined them and started to wear the national dress. The principal of the school who was hell-bent on English education suspended him for one week from attending the school as the punishment. He preferred to learn commerce and his parents were instrumental in giving him a private education to achieve his aim.
He came off with flying colours in his chosen field of study and joined the co-operative union of Baddegama as an account clerk. This is his first step into the sphere of co-operative movement in our country and his greatest desire was to contribute his share for the uplift of the co-operative movement in the locality in particular and in Sri Lanka in general. This promising co-operative worker became an assistant teacher of commerce in 1961 and his first appointment was to G/Wanduramba Central College. Pirivena education was very popular during this period and he passed his G. C. E. (A/L) Examination from Sri Rathnasara Pirivena, Baddegama, under the able guidance of the late Ven. Ganegama Saranankara Thera. He entered the Maharagama Teachers College in 1964, where he cut his teeth as a professional teacher. Teaching commerce was his forte. There, he fired another salvo against the tradition of using the fork and spoon at the hostel and made his name as a true patriot.
His life was full of interesting anecdotes and once he had visited Chief Prelate Ven. Bambarende Siri Sivali to invite him to a sermon. He served on the tutorial staff of Richmond College from 1969 to 1972. His next school was G/Wanduramba Central College and while in service, he followed the Higher Education Diploma in Accountancy at the Galle Techincal College. Thus he became better qualified to serve the co-operative movement with confidence.
He was politically victimized in 1978 and was transferred to Mannar. Later, he was able to come to Aluthgama Maha Vidyalaya and he ended his illustrious teaching career at G/Gonapinuwala Maha Vidyalaya in the Galle district. He was later promoted to the second tire of the educational administrative service in recognition of his yeoman service to education and political victimization which was the order of the day before human rights gained its due place in our country.
His co-operative saga began when he joined the Baddegama East Co-operative Credit and Thrift Society in 1960. He climbed up the ladder of the co-operative hierarchy systematically from the post of secretary to the top-most post, the president, within a very short period of time.
The building complex of the Baddegama East Co-operative Credit and Thrift Society that stands at Weihena on the Baddegama - Wanduramba road, bears ample testimony for his dedication and commitment to the community service. The then Vice President late Piyasena Rillagoda was instrumental in his noble service to his hometown. He was the pillar behind his success. The SANASA Co-operative building in Baddegama, the longest of this kind in our country, is the brainchild of this colossus figure of unmatchable stature; it is the living edifice of his soul. The Baddegama tea smallholders co-operative tea factory is another beneficiary of his co-operative service saga. The whole village underwent a revolutionary co-operative revival under his golden touch. In other words, everything he touched turned into gold in co-operative sense. His name goes down in the annals of the co-operative history as the longest-serving president in the sphere of Sri Lanka. To put it in a nutshell, where the word sounds co-operative, Senevirathne is echoed.
He breathed his last on August 16, 2017. He was born on March 16, 1936. The third month remembrance is scheduled to be held in a grand manner on November 17. His widowed wife, Habaraduwa Hewage Gunawathie, is always in praise of his immesurable service to the family and the people in the vicinity. He left his beloved sons Dayanath, Asiri and his only daughter Ganga Tharanganie in lifelong sorrow. Yet, his eldest son has already taken the batton to continue his yeoman service to the country, following his fathers footsteps. His daughters-in-law Manomi Dhammika Chandrasekara and Chamila Suhadini Wiesinghe and his son-in-law Vikum Rudrigu lost their great mentor forever. His grandchildren Naduni Nimasha, Thenuli Thihara, Thavindu Isuranga and Rashini Kavish Rudrigu were deprived of grandparenting in their most crucial period of emotional development.
People of his calibre are rarely born. David E. P. A. Senevirathne was one of them. He possessed both sense and sensibility in serving the people, a rare trait that the modern society is poignantly lacking.
As his third month remembrance is in the offing, I hope, it is quite opportune to pin a great saying from our bard William Shakespeare in recognition of his perseverance to serve the co-operative movement.
Praying what is lost,
Makes the remembrance dear
- William Shakespeare (Alls Well that Ends Well)
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana at the completion of his journey in samsara!

Percy Handy
A beloved friend
Percy Charles Athputharajh Handy was born on August 29, 1925, into an illustrious family of Rev. J. T. N. Handy and Rosie Handy. His father, Rev. J. T. N. Handy MBE, was Private Secretary to the Chief Justice of Singapore during World War 2.
At the height of the war, when the Japanese had overrun Malaya and were about to capture Singapore, Percy, his mother and sisters were sent to Ceylon by his father. The family was received in Colombo by his father's brother Dr. G. R. Handy, who was a leading cardiologist at the General Hospital, Colombo, at that time.
Percy was soon admitted to St. John's College, Jaffna. However, his time at St. Johns came to an end in 1945, when he had to go back to Singapore. He graduated from the University Malaya, Singapore and came back to Ceylon. His father also returned to Ceylon and was appointed as the Secretary of the Anglican Diocese of the Church of Ceylon. Percy started his career with the Bank of Ceylon and was a manager for two decades. Later, he joined the Hatton National Bank as Assistant General Manager and served for 12 years. He was the only boy in the family and his sisters were late Ranee (wife of the late Prof. C. J. Eliezer), late Rathi(wife of the late Rev. A. J. C. Selvaratnam, former Warden of St. Thomas College, Mt Lavinia), late Ranji(wife of former Cabinet Minister late Maithiripala Sennanayake), Ria(wife of Dr. M. D. Daniel of USA)and Anto(wife of Joe Samuel, formerly of Samuel and Sons).
Percy married Arunthathy Tissanayagam, who was a teacher at Chundikuli Girls College, Jaffna. He and Arunthathy were keen tennis players. They were blessed with two children; Indran and Malawho. Dilhan, Johann and Natalie are his loving grandchildren. Percy always took an active part in church activities. Finally, he settled down in Melbourne, Australia, with his children and grandchildren. In October, last year, he answered the call from his Maker.

L. A. Gunasekera
A noble mother
I write this appreciation with much feelings as the seventh death anniversary of my mother, L. A. Gunasekera, which falls on November 10 nears. Feelings of happiness for the beautiful memories we have of her. Feelings of sadness that she is no longer with us to share life's joys and sorrows. We miss her, but we know that she is free from pain now. We remember her as a loving mother, friend and silent social worker with love and gratitude.
Mother hailed from a distinguished family of Matara. She was a lady par excellence. It could be said that there was a place in her heart for everyone she came into contact with. She was also respected by one and all for her sympathy, affection and compassion. She was also one who walked among the cream of society, but never lost the common touch. Such was her unique calibre.
We loved her in life and we shall not forget her in death. Her passing away came as an irreparable loss to all.
She was married to Dublin de Silva, a businessman of Matara and was blessed with 10 children. Her eldest son, Ivan De Silva, was the Secretary to the Mahaweli Development Ministry in the past government.
I will be failing in my duty if I do not mention her sister-in-law, Anura de Silva, who looked after her as a Florence Nightingale during her long illness, at her ancestral home in Kamburugamuwa, Matara.
May she attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!
Four years ago, on this sad day
The one we loved was called away
God took her home, it was his will
But in our hearts, she lives still.
Cecil R. Senanayake
Ranee Eliezer
She was a dedicated community worker
Ranee Eliezer (nee Handy) was called to rest by her Maker on October 9, 2017. She was the eldest daughter of the late Rev. J. T. N. and late Rose Handy. Ranee, though born in Malaya, moved to Singapore where her father was the Director of Social Services. Her siblings were Rathie, Percy, Ranji, Ria and Anto.
During the Japanese occupation of Singapore in the 1940s, her family was sent to Ceylon for safety by boat by her father. On their way, their boat was bombed by a Japanese aircraft, but they were picked up by a passing British troop ship and reached Ceylon safely. The family settled down in Kopay, Jaffna.
Soon, Ranee started teaching at St Johns College, Jaffna, where her grandfather, the late Rev. C. C. Handy, had been the first Ceylonese Principal. In 1944, she married Christie Jeyam Eliezer, a lecturer of mathematics at the University of Colombo. Her husband, within a short time, took up the Chair of the Department of Mathematics and later, was made the Dean of the Faculty of Science. Eliezer by this time, had gained many international academic accolades and was recognised as one of worlds leading scientists. Both of them travelled widely as her husband had to attend many international conferences and be resident in some countries on well-earned sabbatical leave.
The family moved to Malaya in 1959 and after ten years or so, in 1969, they settled down in Melbourne, Australia. Ranee gained her Preliminary Masters in Archaeology and Anthropology during this time. Her thesis looked at the history of Tamils in Australia; tracing back to their arrival in the1880s. Her interest was always on Jaffna and Tamil culture. She was a dedicated community worker.
After the demise of her husband, she wrote the book 'Conquering Scientist.' This book spells out details of her family, as well as many of her husbands scientific and mathematical equations, his achievements and his fight for justice. Of her siblings, all have gone beyond the veil except Ria and Anto.
The Eliezers leave behind five children, seven grandchildren and five great grandchildren May she rest in peace and rise in glory!

Mifraz Namiz
A sportsman par excellence
We were making Dua for his speedy recovery, but Allah's decision reigned supreme. Mifraz Namiz passed away on October 8, 2017.
Mifraz was an athlete of the highest calibre, who excelled in many sports and brought honour for Zahira and a classy batsman who could easily rival his better-known contemporaries Atapatthu, Dharmasena and so forth.
A super century against the star-studded Nalanda at Campbell Place in 1989, prompted the Observer to scream 'Gallant Zahirians Steal the Limelight,' while reporting on that week's schools tournament. Later on in the season, during a knockout cricket match, he scored a power-packed century to beat Thurstan and reach the quarter finals. Unfortunately, the College withdrew from the tournament due to the month of Ramadhan. Players opted to play with fasting, but when the plea was refused, Mifraz and his team respected the management's decision albeit with a heavy heart. He always felt it was a tournament that Zahira could have won.
He lost his teeth while facing the Ananda bowlers, due to an uneven bounce problem in the matting wicket. When Ananda was batting in reply they had to face the barrage of Zahirian pacers, injuring a couple of players including Atapatthu. Fearing further injuries, the Ananda team requested Zahira to call-off play as the big match against Nalanda was around the corner. Mifraz accepted it and as an appreciation, the Zahira team was honoured by Ananda in their big match as special guests. To my knowledge, that was the only occasion where Ananda honoured an entire cricket team in this prestigious annual encounter. Whereas his contemporary schoolboys such as Atapatthu, Jayasuriya, Dharmasena were highly talented cricketers, Namiz was an excellent cricketer, footballer (he captained the College in both), ruggerite, hockey player and a successful athlete as well.
He was also appointed as the College Senior Prefect. These are only some of his on-field exploits. They do, however, reflect the larger accomplishments of Mifraz during his lifetime. Zahira is proud of him.
He was also very fond of getting youngsters to get involved in sports. When schools were closed in late 80's due to the incessant curfews, he got the boys in the neighbourhood to play cricket and kept them busy in a gainful manner. He never stopped grooming youngsters. A gutty person, even on the day before admission to hospital he has been involved in training them. He dedicated a large part of his life to uplift Zahira's education and sports through the BOG, OBA, PPT, G90 and a host of other groups and committees. Overall, he was a helpul human being with fine qualities, dearly loved by his family and friends.
May Allah reward him with the highest felicity in Jennathul Firdause.

The Art, the Magic
Dearest Sybil nanda,
Did you notice the raindrops gliding down the window panes of your car as you arrived at the Lionel Wendt on 31st October 2017 Did you watch the paintings drawn by the drops of water on the glass and smile to yourself as a new story, a new series of pictures took root in your mind As you got down from the car and walked to the entrance (where friends and family awaited your arrival), did you hear the happy music created by a group of frogs from the bushes on your right and smile even more knowing that inside, on the white walls is a portrait of their kinsman captured expertly by your brush strokes keeping us - your fans and art lovers - entertained
I hope so. There was no way I could read what was going on in your mind though, as you stepped inside the Lionel Wendt to be kissed and hugged and greeted with wishes of happy birthday. But one thing was certain. Your heart was brimming with joy. The sparkle in your eyes and your smile, said it all.
Having grown up reading your books ever so many moons ago in far-off Unawatuna, as a child it never occurred to me that one day I would be calling you nanda, be a frequent visitor to your quaint writers den in Pepiliyana, to listen to your tales of growing up in Gintota, to learn about your current friends who come to have breakfast with you every morning  the squirrels, the bulbuls and the babblers, to sit at your small round-table with the red and white checker cloth and enjoy a biscuit or a banana  (last year I was especially lucky to sit there and taste a piece of your birthday cake which you had saved for me as I could not attend your party). Receiving an invitation not just for me but for my entire family this year, to celebrate Sybil at 90! at the Lionel Wendt was the culmination of my dreams, dreams, which once not so long ago, when I made friends with Suttara Puncha and teased my cousin asking her Kechcho akkata gaman mahansida, I dared not imagine would one day come true.
Proving that most dreams transcend to reality when the time is right, I was lucky enough to go down on my knees and worship you on your 90th birthday, have you hold my hand and smile and say my name in your gentle voice and apologize, We dont have a chief guest today. Of course, it was alright not to have a chief guest. Who would want a chief guest when you are there!
It was lovely to have you asking me if I saw your newest paintings - you seemed so eager that all of us saw them. I smiled. Its true. You are still a child even on the day you turned 90! I left your side then, and walked to the first painting. And as I did so, noticed the colorful personalities who were present - who seem to be vying with your equally colorful paintings for the attention of the lesser mortals like me. Among them I recognized veteran painter S.H Sarath, Prof.Nimal de Silva, Anura de Silva and Givantha Arthasad (who looked like my fathers twin). I saw your daughter Kusala Wettasinghe was in the audience, and your granddaughter as well as your son, Vinod Wettasinghe.
Then I turned towards the paintings and was mesmerized by the vibrant colours, the expressions on the figures, the kaleidoscope of emotions each painting evoked. I laughed out loud when I saw the doleful expression on the face of a man who reclined in a chair while his concerned wife hovered over him. Even though there was no caption for this painting it was easy to see the man was in trouble of some sort, perhaps with his wife. He had on his face the expression of all men when they realize something was amiss.
From laughter to peace and serenity. The paintings depicting the life of the Lord Buddha painted during 2016  2017 brought back memories of childhood lessons in Buddhism. Today, six days after I saw them, all I have to do is close my eyes to see them again, the beautiful paintings of Queen Mahamayas dream, Prince Siddhartha taking his first steps on the lotus flowers, the sorrow on Channas face as he watches his master cut his hair on the night of the great renunciation, and the peaceful look on the faces of the five ascetics as they listen to the Buddhas first sermon.
Truth be told, I had walked into the Lionel Wendt hoping to meet my childhood buddies again. I hoped to say Hi to Puncha, the mischievous umbrella thief, the overweight Appu and Bappu and the enormous kavum. I did not see them on the walls but  they were there nevertheless on the covers of the books on one side of the room, and so, I was not disappointed. It felt good to say hello to them and then move on to the new paintings, to make new friends.
The weather gods did not permit me to stay until the end of your 90th birthday celebrations, Sybil nanda. But even as the raindrops soaked into me as I left the Lionel Wendt I knew I had lived a chapter in my autobiography (one day should I write it) by being with you on this memorable day.
To borrow the phrase my father wrote in the visitors book that day, Jived, Sharad Shatam. May you see a hundred springs and many more.

Pioneering the digitization of the banking landscape in Sri Lanka, the Bank of Ceylon was the first to introduce and popularize many new technologies among Sri Lankans. Currently the Bank is the largest single network connected to Lankapay common ATM platform in the country with 786 of BOCs own ATMs.
We strategically look into cover in key pockets of the country, we try to provide many of our customers economical, convenient and seamless banking solutions and we have made sure to roll out our CDM network to other parts of the country too. Another objective the Bank has fulfilled was to take the latest banking technology over the boundaries of Colombo and its suburbs to other areas of the country stated the Deputy General Manager Senarath Bandara.
With these new featurefilled Cash Deposit Machines, customers can instantly deposit cash straight into their BOC account to be credited on real time without an additional charge. Unlike many cash deposit machines which requires money to be fed into the machine note by note or be inserted into an envelope, this machine allows customers to place a total bundle of 200 notes in a mix of any denomination in a single transaction.
The customers will receive a detailed mini-statement once the transaction is completed. If customers prefer to make the transaction completely paperless this CDM gives the customer the opportunity to activate an SMS alert to be received to a given mobile number.

Basil blown by Geethas judgement
Former strongman minister Basil Rajapaksas political hopes have been shattered following the Supreme Court confirming the expulsion of his star candidate Geetha Kumarasinghe from Parliament, party sources said yesterday.
Basil Rajapaksa who launched the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) after breaking away from the old-established Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was planning a comeback if Thursdays court decision went in favour of Kumarasinghe.
Party sources said Basil Rajapaksas hopes had been raised on May 15 when a three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court in a majority decision granted Kumarasinghe more time to remain in parliament. The interim order had raised hopes of SLPP leader Basil Rajapaksa.
The spirit of the Constitution dictates that the fate of any member of parliament should be decided within two months.
However, in delivering their judgement on Thursday, a five-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep ruled against Kumarasinghe and also shattered the hopes of two Rajapaksa siblings, Basil and Gotabhaya.
The highest court upheld a decision of the Court of Appeal which unanimously held that Kumarasinghe, a star figure in the break away SLFP group, was never qualified to be a candidate.
Kumarasinghes expulsion was based on provisions of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which bars nationals who also hold citizenship of another country from holding elected office.
Never give up US citizenship
Basil Rajapaksa told the BBC recently that he will never give up his US citizenship and claimed that voters of the Gampaha district had supported him with some 425,000 preferential votes despite his US nationality.
I am not ready to give up my US citizenship. My children and family are there (in the United States), Basil Rajapaksa said. I entered politics with US citizenship.
He said he could not speak about his youngest brother Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the former Defence Secretary, who is also attempting to enter politics while retaining both Sri Lankan and US nationalities.
It is ironic that a party built on patriotism is led by those who have already pledged allegiance to the United States of America.
The two Rajapaksa siblings are known to have fallen out recently with Gotabhaya keeping away from Basils SLPP and having his own campaign to drum up support from among ultra nationalist groups.
In a blow to Gotabhayas campaign, Basil announced in Jaffna while launching his SLPP in the peninsula last month that the military under their elder brother Mahinda had committed crimes that should be independently investigated.
He said they were not war crimes but nevertheless crimes committed during and even after the end of the war in May 2009. Basils remarks are known to have caused anger among the supporters of Gotabhaya who have maintained no such thing happened and also resist any type of investigation into the militarys conduct.
Basils camp is also unhappy with the recent statement of Gotabhaya-loyalist, retired Army Major General Kamal Gunaratne, who called for the execution of anyone supporting constitutional reforms.
Gunaratnes endorsement of the brutal tactics of Deshapremi Janatha Viyaparaya (DJV) has caused unease in Basils camp because some of their members were also at the receiving end of the DJV terror between 1987 and 1990.
The retired military officer Gunaratne has become a liability for Gotabhaya too and was missing from the more recent meetings of the group which is also facing ideological differences between two factions within the camp.
Geetha Kumarasinghes judgement, which firmly shuts the door for the return to Parliament for both Basil and Gotabhaya, has also led to a scramble among SLPP members to get a new leader as their General Secretary G.L. Peiris is not considered a strong contender.

## Title: Belle

Belle
Belle had a scar on the third finger of her left hand. She was twenty-nine and unmarriedtwice.
To know what she looked like, you had to ask somebody. That didnt always help though. Like, one time in the Beauty Parlor, Skeezers little Sister said Belle was ugly, but the hair dresser said, Aw, Belle a mighty pretty girl, sister.
Little Sister said, She skinny...
Now, I wouldnt rightly say, skinny.
...her hairs stringly...
Any womans is, when its just done.
...she got buck teeth...
Ho Lord.
...and she got right curious-looking legs!
And the hairdresser laughed so hard at that he couldnt say anymore.
Belle didnt even know, her-own-self. Like her second husband just kept on telling her how pretty she was all the time and she wouldnt believe him; but her first husband never would say one thing or the other, and that made her mad. About her first husband, though, she never could say that he really made her mad, he just kept her puzzled. He never said much about anything at all, and then one day he just went and died, and Belle wondered why he waited so long for her when, after he finally got her, he wasnt going to say anything and was going to just die so soon after.
Her second husband, though, was the one ran after her. Even when she was going after her first husbandto find out how come he was so quiet, and why he never seemed to notice hereven then her second husband chased her. And when they got married, he kept right on running: out there on the streets, popping his fingers and kicking his heels up til Belle got mad after a year and quit him.
Belle was always running from or after somebody. One time at the Musetta house party she ran from Skeezer all night until Pretty Willie came after her and then she started looking for Skeezer again. But he was mad at her by that time because he didnt think she should of danced with Pretty Willie in the first place.
When Pretty Willied come over, Skeezer told him, You better not let your wife catch you over here fooling around.
But Pretty Willie said, Aw, she told me I could dance with Belle.
So Belle danced with him anyway because he was a good dancer before he got married. And then he had to start carrying on.
You better take your hand away from there, Belle told him.
Aw, dont be like that, Belle; I dont mean no harm.
You dont mean no good, neither.
But he just kept on so Belle had to leave him right there in the middle of the floor. And when she went back to find Skeezer, he was mad. So Belle just went over and talked to Goofer who used to be an old boy friend and still looked kind of pleased all over when Belle was around. And Skeezer got mad again.
It didnt mean anything, though. Skeezer was always trying to talk to Belle, and she always made him mad. The first time, when they were sitting in Belles house, he just talked about everything except what was on his mind, and then finally he took her hand and looked at the tiny scar on her finger.
Whats the matter with your hand. Belle
Nothing wrong with my hand. Belle had heard this beginning eleventy-five times. She pulled her hand away.
How come cant nobody hold it
Belle looked at him to see what he meant by that. She could never tell what people meant unless she was looking at them, and even then it was hard to tell. People were tricky.
She countered with, Cause it belongs to me. Thats why.
And that finished it for a while. So Skeezer sat and played with the couch cover and couldnt think of anything else to say. Belle felt a little bit sorry, but she wasnt sure whether she was sorrier when Skeezer talked so much like he usually did or when he shut up so fast like that. She put her hand back on his and started to say something to make up, but dont you know that made him mad! He jumped right up and said, I dont like nobody to play with me, Belle.
And then Belle got mad. She wouldnt even try to explain to him if he was going to take it like that. And since she wasnt going to try to make up, Skeezer knew hed have to leave or something and not just stand there, so he did.
Belle could sing; God, she could sing! Every time somebody gave a finger-popping theyd ask Belle, and shed always get up there while somebody played a home-made banjo and somebody else played a spit-and-guitar, or shed get up there all by herself and get to patting her foot and swinging her hips, and shed throw back her head and just sing, and every-damn-body would hush.
She liked best to talk to the instruments and have them talk back. When they really understood one another, the talking was good. And next she liked it when everybody all around would get to feeling just the way she felt. She always knew when she reached them, and she could make them feel any way she wanted to, from low-down and blue to easy and glad. And that was good because Belle always sang according to how she felt and would know that everybody was feeling the same way.

Into the blue
On the perusal of the annals of history of shipwrecks on the seabed surrounding Sri Lanka; both local and foreign marine biologists, divers and underwater photographers of international fame are not hesitant to unanimously agree that the seabed around Sri Lanka is a paradise for shipwrecks.
Since time immemorial, the sea around Sri Lanka had been a sought after sea route by seafaring nations. Before the advent of the Portuguese, Dutch and the British to the Indian Ocean, a network of Asian maritime traders were operating between East Africa and India, extending to Indonesia. During ancient times, transport by ship was considered the safest, fastest and most economical and thus, was the most used.
Ancient Maritime Silk Road
The ancient Maritime Silk Road expanded across several seas and oceans comprising of the Indian Ocean, South China Sea, Strait of Malacca, the Gulf of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. According to historians, Sri Lanka had played a prominent role as a maritime hub of the ancient Silk Road from China to Europe.
Over many centuries of trade within the oceans of the Asian region, the trade of commodities such as silk, porcelain, gems, precious metals, perfume, gold, silver and horses, were highly competitive and triggered heavy competition among seafaring nations which resulted in conflicts and naval battles which sunk many a ship to the bottom of the ocean and brought watery graves to the mariners during these unfinished expeditions.
Trade conflicts, natural disasters, world wars
Fleets of ships frequented the Indian Ocean for various purposes and the Arabian naval trade network paid greater attention to trade, while the Portuguese were interested in both the spice trade as well as political and religious expansionism.
In addition to the conflicts and rivalry centered around trade and commerce, the First and the Second World Wars had been identified as major reasons for the presence of more than 200 shipwrecks on the seabed around Sri Lanka. Natural disasters also increased the number of shipwrecks in the region.
History of shipwrecks
In 2003, remnants of the oldest shipwreck in the Indian Ocean had been found on the seabed of Godavaya at Hambantota. Two local fishermen, B. G. Preminda and Sunil Rathnaweera of this fishing village were on their usual daily dive for conch shells when they found a stone bench on the seabed of Godavaya. In 2008, divers attached to the Maritime Archaeological Unit found ceramic bowls and blue glass Ingots at the site of Godavaya wreck.
Dr. Osmund Bopearachchi attached to the National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris, Dr. Mehendo Carlson and Sheila Mathews, had dived twice a depth of 33m at the location and discovered numerous artefacts. Later, under Archaeological Department Director General Dr. W. H. Wijepala, a German team of Archaeologists from the University of Bonn carried on a joint research at Godavaya. During their excavations at Godavaya, they found vital information relevant to the role played by the Godavaya Port in the ancient Maritime Silk Road.
Marine environment
When shipwrecks were buried on the seabed for many hundreds of years, they naturally become unique habitats for the marine flora and fauna of diverse species, creating a marine environment rich in biodiversity.
Over the years, every shipwreck has been transformed into gardens of multi-coloured corals, fish and marine creatures such as sponges, anemones, clams, octopus, squid, mollusks, eels, rays, turtles and cowries. Shipwrecks also facilitate archaeologists in the proper understanding of the past. For instance, a Bronze Age shipwreck known as the Ulu Burun Shipwreck believed to be made in 1300 BC, was carrying cargo comprising of ivory, ebony, ostrich eggs, resin, spices, jewellery, textiles, ingots of copper, tin and glass. Marine archaeologists were surprised to observe the artifacts discovered on this one vessel comprised of items from 11 different cultures.According to the findings of UNESCO, there are over three million shipwrecks on the seabed throughout the world.
Well-known science fiction writer late Arthur C. Clarke and Mike Wilson discovered the 18th Century shipwreck known as the Great Basses Wreck on March 22, 1961 in the Southern coast of Sri Lanka.
This ship is believed to have been owned by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Its cargo comprised of gunny bags full of newly-minted silver rupees from Surat, India. Arthur Clarke gifted 1,000 coins to the Smithsonian Institute.
S. S. Conch
The British Oil Tanker S. S. Conch weighing 3,555 tons, which belonged to the Shell Transport Trading Company, was wrecked at the Akurala reef on the South coast on June 2, 1903. Conch was on a voyage carrying a large bulk of petroleum to Madras from Novorossisk. This ship was the first Oil Tanker built in the world.
Now the wreck of Conch lies at a depth of 12 to 21m and has become a very popular diving site located on the seabed in between Ambalangoda and Hikkaduwa. Marine creatures such as groupers, angelfish and numerous species of reef fish, are found in abundance inside the shipwreck.
H. M. S. Hermes:
The first Aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy, H. M. S. Hermes, was attacked by nearly 70 heavily armed Japanese aircrafts on April 9, 1942 and a local diver named Felican Fernando found the wreck on the seabed in Batticaloa, 60 years later. The wreck is found at a depth of 44-55m. Sailors numbering 282 in the service of the Royal Navy lost their lives in the attack.
Hercules
The ship Hercules was wrecked in the Bay of Galle on May 22, 1661. The Western Australian Maritime Museum, which was assisting the Sri Lankan Government in the conservation of shipwrecks at the time, discovered the shipwreck of Hercules in 1993 on the seabed of the Galle harbour. A Bronze Bell with the inscription Amor Vincit Omnia Anno 1625 was discovered. At the same location, 30 cannons were found.
British Sergeant
This steamer was sunk in 1942 by a Japanese Aircraft carrier. The wreck was found on a sandy bottom at a depth of 24 metres on the seabed of Passikudah.
S. S. Perseus
This ship was built for the Ocean Steam Ship Company in 1908 by Clark Belfast. German raider S. M. S. Wolf attacked the ship.
S. S. Wocestershire
The wreck of this ship could be seen on the seabed off Mount Lavinia, Colombo. It was discovered by Nishan Perera, Naren Gunasekara and Dharshana Jayawardena; three divers searching for the site of the wreck and located the exact point at a depth of 57m on the information provided by some fishermen.
The ship met its fateful end in 1917 on its journey from Rangoon to London, caused by a sea mine laid by the German raider S. M. S. Wolf.
Earl of Shaftsbury
Earl of Shaftsbury is a British sailing ship about 14 metres and 80 metres in length and is about 125 years old. This ship was believed to be burnt by a fire which occurred on board. It was en route to Diamond Island from Bombay and capsized at Akuralain between the Hikkaduwa and Ambalangoda seabed on the South coast not far away from the wreck of Conch.
Dynamiting shipwrecks
Majority of the shipwrecks on the seabed from Balapitiya, Hikkaduwa to Galle have been highly dynamited to remove iron, copper and artefacts by fishermen. All the shipwrecks are breeding grounds of fish and other forms of marine creatures.
But a group of international divers who have just returned from their wreck diving tour revealed that Hikkaduwa had vast potential to expand as one of the hot spots in the world for diving due to the existence of the marine sanctuary of shipwrecks found on the ocean bed in and around the area.

Boycotting lectures unfair: Prof. Samaranayake
Students continue their boycott of lectures when the GMOA and the Universities Vice Chancellors had shown some agreement with the Governments solution to the SAITM issue was unfair, former UGC Chairman Prof. Gamini Samaranayake said.
As much as free education should be protected, educational freedom should also be safeguarded, while students boycotting lectures should realise that this would shorten their professional life, he said.
Prof. Samaranayake said that medical students had already frittered away the expenditure to keep the Peradeniya University open for a day.
Although Rs. 200,000 was set apart to keep the medical faculty open for a day, Rs. 1.6 million was needed to keep eight medical faculties open for a day.
The Government would lose over Rs. 40 million if students were to boycott lectures for a month. The students who continue to boycott lectures, should realise this fact. They should realise that the continuous boycotting would draw their lives backwards by several years, he said.
Prof. Samaranayake said the most powerful party to the anti-SAITM struggle had agreed with the governments solution. But secondary parties to the issue are still continuing with the strike.

Speaking about the elaborate designs, Tiesh, Directors, Ayesh and Thiyasha De Fonseka remarked, This is a collection of statement pieces which are perfect for cocktails or evening functions. Using a new range of cuts and styles in fashioning the gemstones we have gained ground in the ever-evolving fashion trends of Milan and Paris.
While the main focus in the collection is centered on the versatile sapphires, we also showcase other Sri Lankan gemstones and the timeless value of diamonds which always lives up to its reputation as being a girls best friend. By setting these stones in precious metals of rose gold, white gold, yellow gold and silver, we have further enhanced their original value many fold, they added.
The Directors went on to say that Tiesh uses Sri Lankan gemstones as much as possible. Since we have such a vast range of beautiful, naturally-coloured and textured gemstones we can boast of. The collection comprises beautiful necklaces, earrings, pendants and rings, with a focus on the larger pieces designed primarily for events and cocktails.

A BUDGET FOR ENTERPRISE
Perhaps it is sometimes easy to forget how far we have come as a nation. Since 2015 our economy has undergone huge transformation at a time of global turbulence. Strengthening macroeconomic stability amidst a supportive policy framework has been crucial to realizing our true potential. Now we have received strong recognition by international financial experts that the reforms we have taken are the right ones and it is clear that our international reputation is restored and strong.
We recognize there is still so much more to do as we work hard to secure a better future for all Sri Lankans. Sri Lanka has a long history of excelling as a trading nation but we need to create a climate where people can reach their full potential, where entrepreneurs can flourish and where women are able to play their full role as equals in business and commerce.
Spirit of national competitiveness
So, the forthcoming Budget will be a budget for enterprise. A lean, clean and green budget. A bold attempt to reawaken the spirit of enterprise in Sri Lanka and an opportunity to kick start the economy and move forward. To become an Indian Ocean hub for trade, investment and for global talent.
The spirit of national competitiveness must be reawakened; to do so Sri Lanka needs to liberalize and globalized. Our ancient forefathers excelled as traders and entrepreneurs in the Anuradhapura/Polonnaruwa era because they were out ward looking and were not afraid to compete with the world. The time has come again, to unleash the dormant talent of our people by giving them a helping hand.
A prime objective of this is to assist the business community by offering credit under more flexible terms as we set up a special Bank for Development Finance. We will strip away unnecessary bureaucracy and hurdles to receiving investment and make the process easier. This will mean access to credit for entrepreneurs at non-punitive and affordable rates. Giving young people access to investment and creating wealth and jobs.
Access to loan concessions
We are able to do this because we have effectively managed our nations debt. In the near future the Rupees three trillion debt we inherited from the Rajapaksa regime will be settled. Then we will be an even stronger position to give a helping hand to business, to entrepreneurs and to our future. Investing billions to ensure our people get education, skills training and can find jobs.
So, we are making sure investment reaches the right people and expanding schemes to help Sri Lankan business and entrepreneurs, making sure those who deserve backing and support receive it.
We will encourage women by making sure medium sized companies run by females get access to loan concessions. Policies toward helping business women will be progressive and recognize equality of opportunity. We recognize the contribution Sri Lankan women make to society and we want them to fulfil their full potential.
International recognition of the major reforms we have undertaken such as the Inland Revenue Act means there will be incentives to foreign direct investment in Sri Lanka. This will provide much needed resources and stimulus to our local business, industry and enterprise.
The IMF recognizes our good governance in Sri Lanka and that we have met targets on finance and the economy. Within the next two years we will see the full benefits of the restoration of our GSP+ status by the EU. We are already seeing our fishing industry helped by the removal of the European ban on fishery products from Sri Lanka.
Better future for all Sri Lankans
Investment is only possible because of the measures our government has taken to build a strong economy. Some of those decisions have been hard and tough laws have been put in place. But let me assure you, decisions are always taken in the best interests of Sri Lanka and its people. We are working to fix the mistakes of the past and building a stronger economy for a better future for all Sri Lankans.
We are building a strong economy and relieving future generations from the burden of debt. Ours will be a good legacy for a happy future for Sri Lankans. The imminent Budget will send a strong signal that Sri Lanka is a vibrant trading nation with a strong economy.
It will be a budget to help the environment, to foster enterprise and will result in a better country for everyone.

A car driven by a woman had collided with five vehicles within a 200-metre distance in the Vijaya Rajadahana area, on November 4 Mirigama injuring seven persons. The injured were admitted to the Mirigama Hospital.
An injured, a three wheel driver and father of three, was transferred to the Wathupitiwala Hospital and from there to the Colombo National Hospital.
The driver and her son are among the injured.
The car driven from the Vijaya Rajadahana Housing Complex had brushed against a car and two motorcycles, sped past the Vijaya Rajadahana level crossing and collided with two three wheelers parked aside of the Pasyala-Mirigama Road before running off the road and crashing into a wayside Mango tree.
Mirigama police said the car would have crashed since its driver may have mistakenly pressed the accelerator instead of the brakes.
Police said the driver would be arrested and produced in court.

Case against Dhammaloka Thera fixed for trial

A private plaint filed against Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka of Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda for allegedly using loudspeakers in a manner causing nuisance was today fixed for trial by Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court.
Both respondent and complainant parties were unable to reach a settlement. Accordingly, the matter was fixed for trial on February 5 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe.
At a previous occasion, the Court decided to overrule preliminary objections raised by Ven.Uduwe Dhammaloka of Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda over a private plaint filed against him for allegedly using loudspeakers in a manner causing nuisance.
On December 6, 2016, the Court had issued a conditional order preventing Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera from using loudspeakers in a manner of causing nuisance at Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda between 5.00 a.m. and 6.00 a.m.
The Court had made this order taking into consideration a private plaint filed by six parties including former Minister Milinda Moragoda and Centre for Environmental Justice alleging that loudspeakers used by Ven.Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera at Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda was causing an annoyance and disturbance to the residents.
Through this private plaint, the six complainants sought the Courts jurisdiction to avert noise pollution taking place in the area in terms of the Section 98 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The six complainants Gavinda Jayasinghe, Dr.Kalinga Kaluperuma, Diren R. Halok, Milinda Moragoda, Kamalesh Johnpillai and Centre for Environmental Justice informed Court that they were compelled against their will to listen to the amplified sounds which emanate from the loudspeakers at the Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple. They said the authorities have turned a blind eye to their complaints made on several occasions.
Senior Counsel Ravindranath Dabare with counsel Sugath Athapattu appeared for the Centre for Environmental Justice.

Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yan has said China was ready to work on reducing the trade imbalance and to support economic and social development in Sri Lanka.
The Chinese Vice Premier met Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana, who is on an official visit to China to attend the celebrations of the 60th Anniversary of diplomatic relations and the 65th Anniversary of economic relations between Sri Lanka and China.
During discussions with Minister Marapana, Vice Premier Yan had observed that the Belt and Road initiative of China provides a better platform for a new open economy and since Sri Lanka has a favourable geographic location, it could benefit largely from the initiative.

Cleanliness matters
At present in Sri Lanka (India as well) people have not realised the importance of having clean toilets (public and private). Several eating houses, restaurants, clubs, theatres do not have proper toilet facilities even for their own employees. Non-communicable diseases such as typhoid, diarrhoea and yellow fever spread fast in the absence of proper toilet facilities.
In a recent survey in India, it was revealed that ladies feel shy to use toilets when they go out to attend functions and even at offices as well, causing health problems which are on the increasing trend. The same situation prevails in Sri Lanka as well.
In countries promoting tourism like Sri Lanka must take special care as regards this matter. Countries like Singapore, Thailand in South East Asia have taken utmost care in this regard. One tourist had made a sarcastic comment Culture of Indians, Sri Lankans could be revealed when we walk into public toilets. This is a fact.
Religious places of worship consider it is a sin to have toilets within the sacred area. It is true that more than 95% of the places of worship do not have proper toilet facilities.
Establishments which have female employees must have proper separate toilet facility within 50 yards of the working place (labour law). Further, the additional facilities have to be provided for disabled persons.
It is necessary to develop a culture of clean toilets (paid or unpaid).

Colombo Port becomes 25th busiest container port in the world
Colombo Port (SLPA) has become the 25th busiest ranked container port in the world according Lloyds List. SLPA was ranked two slots below in 2016.
Ho Chi Minh City was named 24th busiest port. The significant rise in volumes in Colombo came as a result of an influx of ultra large containerships calling the Colombo International Container Terminal, situated in the ports new south harbour development, capable of handling three ULCs simultaneously, the publication said.
Chinese ports dominates the list with Shanghai in top spot 37.13 million TEUs, Shenzen in third with 23.97 million units, Ningbo-Zhoustan (4th place) with 21.56 million units, Hong Kong (6th) with 19.81 million, Guangzhou (7th) 18.8 million and Qindao (8th place) with 18.0 million units..
Outside of China only Singapore (2nd place) with 30.9 million units, South Koreas Busan (5th place) 19.85 million and Dubai (9th place) with 14.77 million were outside China.
Volume growth in 2017 was fragmented; fortunes fluctuated between regions and countries, but one common theme remained. China is the main growth engine according to Lloyds List Top 100 Ports review. Total volumes may have risen moderately yet this was not to say that there were not any success stories over the course of the 12 months, as indeed there were. This helped to mask some dire performances elsewhere.

Commercial Bank commissions landmark 700th ATM in Sri Lanka
The automated teller machine (ATM) network of the Commercial Bank of Ceylon achieved a milestone this week with the commissioning of its 700th ATM terminal at MAS Intimates Vidiyal in Kilinochchi.
The event followed the commissioning of two other Commercial Bank ATMs at AIA Insurances Corporate Office in Colombo and at the Laugfs Indhana theme park at Bandaragama, taking the network from 697 to 700 terminals.
The Commercial Bank ATM network is the largest owned by a private bank in Sri Lanka, and has over the years set and rewritten many records for cash dispensed during times of national celebrations such as the Sinhala and Tamil New Year and Christmas.
In the first 14 days of April this year for example, the Banks ATM network, then comprising of 658 terminals, dispensed a mammoth Rs 23.9 billion in cash.
By mid-2016 the Bank had completed the upgrade of the network to EMV Chip capability, significantly enhancing security against fraud by conforming to the EMV standards of the various card brands that it accepts. As a result, every Commercial Bank ATM now accepts and processes transactions based on Smart Card Integrated Circuit (IC) data as well as magnetic strip data.
Over 20% of the Banks ATMs are located outside the vicinity of its branches covering places such as industrial zones, railway stations, central bus stands, apartment complexes, shopping malls and large scale factories enhancing access for customers and non customers alike.
In addition to facilitating withdrawals, the Banks ATM machines enable convenient settlement of water and electricity bills, bills of Dialog, Mobitel, Etisalat, Hutch and Lanka Bell networks, and Commercial Bank Credit Card payments 24-hours a day, 365-days of the year. The Banks network of teller machines is linked with millions of ATMs across the world.
Commercial Bank ATMs also support the networks of Mastercard, Maestro, Cirrus, Visa, Plus, Amex, UnionPay, Discover and Diners Club thus enabling tourists and other visitors to Sri Lanka to withdraw money from their overseas accounts for spending in the country.
The Banks 600th ATM was located at the Colombo Gold Centre, the 500that the Maradana Railway Station and the 400th at the Banks Ruwanwella branch.

CR rally in 2nd half to beat Air Force 21-9
CR&FC scored a hard fought 21 points (2 tries, 1 conversion, 3 penalties) to 9 (3 penalties) win against a fighting Air Force outfit in their Dialog 'A' division Inter-club League Rugby Tournament match played at Air Force ground in Ratmalana yesterday.
Both teams had their moments in the game and CR produced two tries and that decided the victor in the end.
The match winner for CR was fly half Tharinda Ratwatte, whose contribution was an amazing 11 points, which came off through three penalties and one conversion. Air Forces chances were kept alive through the boot of Charith Seneviratne who slotted in three penalties.
CR & FC had to struggle somewhat in the first half with Airmen drawing first blood with an early penalty by centre Charith Seneviratne and went in to a 3-nil lead.
Soon after the Red shirts equalled scoring to 3-all through a penalty booted by Tharinda Ratwatte.
Air Force stretched their lead with a well-taken penalty by Seneviratne to make it 6-3 which was the score at half time.
After the breather CR brought play into the Airmens half and succeeded in crossing the line through the efforts of burly second row forward Charana Chamikara with the help of granite hooker Supun Warnakulasuriya. Ratwatte converted the try to grab the lead for the first time 8-6. Seneviratne slotted in a penalty kick minutes later to take back the lead 9-8.
CR clearly had the edge over Airmen in the second half where Ratwatte slammed a penalty to hand CR the lead again 11-9.
The Red shirts increased their lead to 18 points to 8 when they were awarded a penalty try by the referee and Ratwatte was spot on with the conversion.
Air Force played with a big heart but not retaining the ball and giving away some penalties during the end didnt help their cause. CR sealed their victory with a penalty put over by Ratwatte during injury time.

Dazzling Bayern outclass Dortmund to go four points clear
BERLIN, Saturday - Champions Bayern Munich outclassed title rivals Borussia Dortmund 3-1 away on Saturday to go four points clear at the top of the Bundesliga and stretch their perfect run under coach Jupp Heynckes to seven straight victories in all competitions.
Arjen Robbens superb left-footed effort put them ahead in the 17th minute and forward Robert Lewandowski added a second when he flicked in with a back heel for his 11th of the season.
David Alabas intended cross ended up in the back of the net in the 67th minute to seal the win before Marc Bartra grabbed a late consolation goal.
Bayerns victory was their seventh straight in all competitions since Heynckes took over last month following the departure of Carlo Ancelotti, while Dortmund are in complete free fall, suffering their third loss in their last four league games.
Bayern, five points behind Dortmund only three weeks ago, are now top on 26 points, with RB Leipzig, 2-1 winners against Hanover 96, second on 22. Dortmund, who had won six of their first seven league matches, drop to third on 20.
What an outstanding performances, Heynckes, who had led Bayern to a treble of titles in 2013, told reporters. Four weeks ago we could never have imagined that we would now be six points ahead of Dortmund and four of Leipzig.
This is something we worked on hard. I want to pay my compliments to the team. They were 100 percent motivated. We really wanted to win this.
The match lived up to its top Bundesliga billing with an entertaining first half and with Bayern gradually taking control.
They constantly worked their way into the box and Dortmunds Bartra was no match for speedy winger Kingsley Coman, who left the Spaniard in his wake.
Robben completed a fine move with a trademark shot to become Bayerns all-time top foreign scorer with his 93rd league goal.
The hosts should have scored but were again let down by their bad finishing as Andriy Yarmolenko failed to convert when one-on-one with Bayern keeper Sven Ulreich and Shinji Kagawa scraped the post with a shot a little later.
Instead it was Bayern who struck again with Lewandowski flicking in a Joshua Kimmich cutback in the 37th and Alabas cross floating past the Poland striker and keeper Roman Buerki into the net.
Bartras 87th minute goal was purely cosmetic, with pressure on Dortmund coach Peter Bosz now mounting considerably.
Forward Timo Werner set up a goal and scored a late winner himself as Leipzig battled from a goal down against Hanover. Germany international Werner set up Yussuf Poulsen for a 70th-minute equaliser after Hanovers Jonathas had tapped in and then snatched an 85th-minute winner for his sixth goal of the season. Hamburg SV beat 10-man VfB Stuttgart 3-1 for their first victory since the second matchday to move out of the relegation spots and into 15th on 10 points. - Agencies

Eating alone is bad for your health
Risk of a metabolic syndrome is high for those who eat alone, a new study claims. Researchers from Dongguk University Ilsan Hospital in Seoul, South Korea found men were especially at risk of developing health issues, according to a report by the Daily Mail.
For the study they examined the relationship between loneliness and health in 7,725 adult males and females, who all eat alone.
Men developed obesity by 45 percent and had a 64 percent chance of developing a metabolic syndrome, the study found. Women were 29 percent likely to develop a metabolic syndrome if they ate two or more meals alone daily.
Because a growing number of people live alone in this day and age, researchers wanted to understand how loneliness leads people to make unhealthy choices when it comes to food. Feeling alone or isolated can cause someone to turn to junk food instead of a healthy meal previous research has indicated.
This therefore causes many to develop prediabetes, high blood pressure and various other health issues.
The study was originally published in Obesity Research & Clinical Practice.

English literature  without theEmpire nostalgia
Last week, the front page of the Telegraph featured a photograph of a young black woman, with a line declaring, Student forces Cambridge to drop white authors. In addition to painting a deliberately misleading picture, their irresponsible and inflammatory singling out of Lola Olufemi, the Cambridge Student Union Womens Officer and one of the many co-signatories of the letter, made her the target of abuse online. The Telegraph then issued a much less prominent clarification, explaining that their story had been altogether incorrect.
In fact, the open letter from Cambridge University students to the English Faculty in question simply drew attention to the comparative lack of writers of colour on their undergraduate reading lists. The letter explicitly emphasized that this was not a call for the wholesale exclusion of canonical white male authors, but a call for comprehensiveness and accuracy. Britains legacy of colonialism means that English literature is also a literature of the Global South, and the two are inseparably bound together. This call was then considered by the English faculty, in which similar discussions were already taking place. This request by students is an example of the kind of open debate and intellectual honesty that helps British higher education to retain its global reputation. For a trigger-happy right-wing press, however, it was just the thing to seize on and take out of context in order to create the illusion of a race war.
Accurate sense
The coverage by papers including the Telegraph and the Daily Mail has had grim undertones of white racial panic, while also appearing ignorant of the very thing they purportedly want to safeguard. To give an accurate sense of English literature and its context, one must abandon the image of an untouched lineage of white English literary development. That development is inextricable from Britains history of imperial conquest, slave-trading, colonialism and migration. It is only by expanding the teaching of English literature to include this full spectrum of influences that we can do justice to those canonical works that sceptics have suddenly made it their mission to rescue.
The figures that conservatives no doubt consider to be the pillars of the discipline  from Donne to Dickens, Shakespeare to Hardy  were living in times of maritime exploration; cross-continental trade; rapid industrialization financed by colonial exploitation; and the very construction of that relatively new, heterogeneous British identity.
The historical moment that preceded the establishment of English as an academic discipline (1894 at Oxford, 1919 at Cambridge), was the high point of nineteenth-century British imperialism in which it became the global hegemon.
The quintessentially English, white, male canonical writers from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries that we see in core reading lists across the country were great precisely because many of them revealed the social, political and economic undercurrents in their societies. To do this, they were certainly utilizing, if not actively profiting from, the stories, ideas and goods trickling back home from Britains imperial pursuits.
Rule Britannia
For instance, Shakespeares complex treatment of Othello  a non-white foreigner of high social status in Venetian society  is what makes the play one of his great tragedies. Othello is subject to a gradual racial and cultural othering by European men who seem to accept diversity, yet who are profoundly threatened, racially and sexually, by his inclusion in their ranks. Can any nuanced reading possibly gloss over the racial history and politics of the plays performance, of blackface and of the lead roles symbolism for black actors through the centuries The idea of Britishness, forged in the eighteenth century, was itself often helped along by the narration of a romantic, imperialist dichotomy between Britain and the world. James Thomsons Rule Britannia, a poem that starts with the great English oak that creates its all-conquering ships, and ends with the Muses finding freedom on this blessed isle, gives us the imperial imaginings behind todays British values. Its cities shine with freedom and commerce, home to Britons who never shall be slaves  while many others were.
Such are examples of postcolonial readings: there is no desire to erase or trivialize the canon, but rather to engage critically in a manner that enriches our understanding of literary works creation, reception and afterlives. Somehow, this is still contentious, so we must keep calling out the deliberate misinterpretation of this as political correctness or the facile attempts to address it through tokenism. But a simple reason to broaden the range of texts and interpretations brought to bear is that this is just good pedagogy. Syllabuses that put Jean Rhyss Wide Sargasso Sea into conversation with Charlotte Bronts Jane Eyre; Chinua Achebes Things Fall Apart with Joseph Conrads Heart of Darkness; or E. M. Forsters A Passage to India with Rabindranath Tagores Home and the World will only result in better thinking and writing on both. When studying the contemporary British novel, the inclusion of works such as Hanif Kureishis The Buddha of Suburbia, Zadie Smiths On Beauty and Monica Alis Brick Lane provide a more representative picture of both British writing and society today. There is, in short, more to learn, and more critical gains to be made, from encouraging students to read a greater variety of literature.
Moreover, decolonizing the curriculum does not stop at handling the canon through more historically-informed and non-Eurocentric viewpoints. That is only the critical mindset  this clarity about the exploitative nature of Empire  that precedes the real work that needs to be done. At Cambridge as at many English faculties throughout the country, three-quarters of students still graduate without ever having read a BME (black and minority ethnic) writer as part of their curriculum.
A vocal undergraduate demand, like the Cambridge students open letter, is a start. But the sense of inevitability that prevails even among faculty  that they must spend the overwhelming majority of their time on certain (white, male) names out of convention and expectation  tells of the weight of institutionalized norms. When something is a norm, it needs to be constantly interrogated and, if necessary, changed. Appointing more specialists in minority literatures, non-Western histories and postcolonial studies to the English faculty could be a valuable step here.

Ensure systems go for justice for the journo!
Thursday November 2 marked the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists. The day draws attention to the low global conviction rate for violent crimes against journalists and media workers, estimated at only one in every ten cases. Last year alone, the UNESCO Director-General, Irina Bokova condemned the killing of 115 journalists, media workers and social media producers of public interest journalism. In 2012, the deadliest year for journalists, 123 cases were condemned.
These figures, however, do not include the many more journalists who on a daily basis suffer from non-fatal attacks, including torture, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention, intimidation and harassment in both conflict and non-conflict situations. In addition, there are specific risks faced by women journalists including sexual attacks.
A vicious cycle
In essence, there is a war on journalism and those attacking us are literally getting away with cold-blooded murder, no less. In the past 11 years close to 930 journalists worldwide have been killed for doing their job, which means basically bringing information to you. On average, a journalist is killed every four days while practicing his or her profession. Allow me to elaborate: The horrifying bottom line is that less than one in ten of these cases have been solved to date and the killers go unpunished.
Impunity is poisonous and leads to more killings. And it is often a symptom of worsening conflict and the breakdown of law and judicial systems. UNESCO is concerned that impunity damages whole societies by covering up serious human rights abuses, corruption and crime. Governments, civil society, the media and everyone concerned to uphold the rule of law are being asked to join in the global efforts to end impunity.
Worryingly, such abuses carried out with impunity embolden the perpetrators of the crimes and at the same time has a chilling effect on society including journalists themselves. That is because impunity breeds impunity and feeds into a vicious cycle.
When attacks on journalists remain unpunished, an ominously negative message is conveyed to the world that reporting the embarrassing truth or unwanted opinions will get ordinary people in trouble. Besides, society loses confidence in its own judicial system which is meant to protect everyone from attacks on their rights. Perpetrators of crimes against journalists are thus emboldened when they realise they can attack their targets without ever facing justice. Society as a whole suffers from impunity. The type of news that gets silenced is exactly the kind that the public needs to know. Information is quintessential in order to make the best decisions in their lives, be it economic, social or political. This access to reliable and quality information is the very cornerstone of democracy, good governance and effective institutions.
Epidemic proportions
It is important for an industry usually averse to introspection to acknowledge the deaths of journalists who have died in pursuit of the news that feeds our work. Much more can be done to promote accountability. Worryingly, one observes violence committed against journalists for simply doing their jobs reaching epidemic proportions with the perpetrators getting away scot free in too many such instances.
A free media is an essential foundation for prosperous, open and secure societies, assisting citizens to access information, exposing abuses and holding their governments accountable. In these and other ways, journalists play a critical role in sustaining comprehensive security. On Thursday we remembered those journalists killed in the line of duty, massacred in cold blood, tortured, taken hostage, murdered for the crime of reporting the truth and for whom there has been no justice. Journalists should be free to work from fear of persecution by those who they hold to account and those who attack journalists should themselves be held to account in courts of law.
Journalists expect societies to continue to stand up for their beliefs. They must fight to ensure reporters can go about their business without fear of being blown up, beheaded, hacked to death or held hostage. We must fight to end impunity for crimes against journalists. Impunity for those who threaten, beat and murder journalists is not only unjust. It sets a dangerous precedent and creates a culture of impunity. Journalists should not be muzzled from asking tough questions. They should be empowered to seek the truth without fear of reprisal.
Such abuses are happening in far too many places. We have seen them in horribly brutal and painful ways this year in Syria. We see them in the ISIS-controlled areas of Iraq and throughout Syria, where the regime and the terror group continue to censor the media through vicious and heinous attacks, including the disappearances and kidnapping of journalists to stop the vital flow of information to the outside world. The United States is committed to working with the Iraqi Government to bring the perpetrators to justice. We call on all parties to the Syrian conflict to protect journalists covering the conflict.
The symbolic significance
The day provides a strategic opportunity to all stakeholders to focus public attention on the importance of ending impunity for crimes against journalists. It also opens new possibilities to draw in constituencies whose primary interests may be other than the safety of journalists. For example, given the symbolic significance of journalists to the wider issue of impunity and justice, all of those who work in the rule of law system, such as people involved in legal and judicial processes, can be reached out to.
Others who are concerned with public participation and citizens rights to speak out on various issues such as corruption or domestic violence will also share an interest in the resolution on combating impunity of attacks on journalists, who by definition are actors in the public eye and whose situation sends a signal to society at large.
On Thursday of all days, we demanded an end to impunity for those who use violence to silence their critics. We demand answers on behalf of all the journalists and their families who still have not seen justice served. And above all, we stand in awe of the courage of those who risk their lives to tell the stories the world needs to hear.
More than 40 years ago when I was a youthful journalist we sometimes joined the police, the army and navy personnel on search operations missions to curb smuggling, illegal immigrants and rescue operations of abducted children used as forced labour in remote fishing wadiyas.
We rode in helicopters and patrol boats. We did not carry guns. We carried cameras, notebooks and pens. Sometimes our pens were more powerful than any military hardware employed in such operations. Yes, we journalists like to tell the story. But we do not relish the prospect of becoming the story, posthumously or otherwise.

AN EVENING OF REVERENCE AT JETWING
In an effort to pay homage to their senior most associates at Jetwing Hotels on dedicating 25 years of service or more to the Jetwing family, an evening of Reverence took place recently at Jetwing Blue with over 80 associates receiving awards of service.
This evening was attended not only by those who have completed 25 years of service and more and are still continuing their service but those who have concluded their long years of dedication to the Jetwing family as well but are still with them as well-wishers.
Their stories of success have undoubtedly contributed to the Jetwing story of triumph. A true inspiration to the young ones within the Jetwing family, Hyacinth Gunawardena joined the Blue Oceanic Blue Hotel (now Jetwing Blue) as a trainee receptionist under the guidance of late Herbert Cooray.
Her thought process of work as a passion than a profession drove her to achieve only the highest of acclaims within the hospitality industry as she presently is the Director General Manager for both Jetwing Blue and Jetwing Beach. Jayasena Bandara who incidentally is the only associate to work under three generations of the Cooray family and who is as old as Jetwing Hotels, has watched many hotels build its way up to the Jetwing chain of hotels and has been a loyal supporter of the Cooray family in building the Jetwing family. In the same light, Ruan Samarasinghe Jetwing Hotels, Managing Director has been a pillar of strength holding the Jetwing family together since its inception with the late Herbert Cooray. Being the most senior associate in the Jetwing Family he has been a true inspiration to all over the years.
As such 82 stories of undeterred dedication and passion were recognized this evening by Jetwing, Chairman, Hiran Cooray. Jetwing Hotels, Managing Director, Ruan Samarasinghe and Jetwing Travels, Managing Director, Shiromal Cooray along with late chairmans wife Josephine Cooray.
Speaking at the event Jetwing, Chairman, Hiran Cooray said, We are blessed to have been in the industry for long years and even more so be a leader in tourism from such humble beginnings. There is no doubt that the legendary service that Jetwing is known for is the hard work and passion put in by all of our associates. Today we celebrate some of the greatest individuals I know, and those who I am privileged to call my colleagues and friends.
I thank all of you for being the strength to my father at the inception and now standing by me as we continue to carry on the legacy of the Jetwing family.

'Every parliamentarian should be probed for dual citizenship'
The Government must probe if there are members in Parliament who have not disclosed their dual citizenship status to the country, Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said.
He said if the public demand for a probe, the police could do it with the support of the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
Many sources has expressed reasonable doubt that more parliamentarians hold dual citizenship. It is the duty of the Government to probe the matter as it is a serious infringement of the Constitution, he said. The Deputy was addressing a media briefing held at the Ministry, yesterday. He spoke on several matters including the Supreme Court decision to unseating former MP Geetha Kumarasinghe.
Deputy Minister Perera said the information at the Department of Immigration and Emigration with regard to MPs holding dual citizenship may be incomplete.
The Immigration and Emigration Department told earlier that they only have information on former MP Geetha Kumarasinghe as an MP, who holds dual citizenship. The only reason that the Immigration and Emigration Department knew this is because Geetha Kumarasinghe actually informed them so. Otherwise, the Immigration and Emigration Department will not know of a change in a persons citizenship status, Perera explained.
Deputy Minister Perera said more parliamentarians who have not disclosed their dual citizenship status may be in parliament. If a law is applicable to Geetha Kumarasinghe, the same law should be applied to all other MPs. The probe could be easily done on all 225 of us without concentrating on individuals, Perera said.
Deputy Minister Perera explained that when Sri Lankan citizens from birth receives citizenship from another country, their citizenships in Sri Lanka get automatically cancelled. Then, they should request the Immigration and Emigration Department to resume his or her status as a citizen of Sri Lanka, he said.
A person holding dual citizenship is not an issue. But MPs are not the same. We as decision-makers who took an oath to serve the country and put it first as citizens of Sri Lanka. If the same persons have allegiance to another country it can be problematic. So, it is important that we find out who has not disclosed information with regard to their citizen status and it is more important to identify who is actually loyal to our motherland, Perera said.
Deputy Minister Perera said that there could be serious consequence for the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) nomination list for the Galle district from where Kumarasinghe was nominated. Perera said the UPFA nomination list could be disqualified on the basis that they have nominated a person who is disqualified and consequently mislead the public. Perera was of the opinion that the matter should be taken up before the Supreme Court.
Speaking on the unseating of Kumarsinghe, Deputy Minister Perera said that she will have to repay the Government all the perquisites she was entitled to within the current term of Parliament. Parliament would calculate the repayment amount in due course, he said.

FIFA corruption trial opens in New York
NEW YORK, Sunday  It was the raid that changed the face of the world's most popular sport. Swiss police swooped in on a five-star Zurich hotel at dawn, arresting seven soccer officials at US request.
Two and a half years later, the only defendants detained in the United States who continue to profess their innocence will go on trial.
When US prosecutors unveiled a years long investigation on May 27, 2015, the allegations were dumbfounding: a quarter of a century of endemic corruption in the heart of FIFA, soccer's governing body.
Forty-two officials and marketing executives, and three companies were indicted in an exhaustive 236-page complaint detailing 92 separate crimes and 15 corruption schemes to the tune of $200 million.
It was the biggest corruption scandal in the history of soccer.
Two generations of soccer officials, then attorney general Loretta Lynch said at the time, used their positions of trust within their respective organizations to solicit bribes from sports marketers in exchange for the commercial rights to their soccer tournaments. They did this over and over, year after year, tournament after tournament.
Tens of millions of dollars was hidden in offshore accounts in Hong Kong, the Cayman Islands and Switzerland, US officials said.
The charges included racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies.
But only three people are actually going on trial -- three fabulously wealthy and once formidably powerful South American soccer officials.
Jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday at the federal court in Brooklyn. Opening statements could begin on November 13.
It will be a hugely complicated trial, expected to last weeks if not months, with prosecutors expected to present 350,000 pages of evidence and dozens of witnesses.
The most high-profile defendant is Jose Maria Marin, 85, former president of Brazil's Football Confederation -- the sport's organizing body in one of the premier soccer-playing nations in the world.
Since his arrest in Zurich and extradition, he has been out on bail, living in luxury at Trump Tower, the Fifth Avenue skyscraper best known for housing the penthouse and company headquarters of the current US president.
Also in the dock is former FIFA vice president Juan Angel Napout, 59, and Manuel Burga, who led soccer in Peru until 2014 and a one-time FIFA development committee member.
A US jury will now decide their fate. If convicted they will be sentenced by Judge Pamela Chen. The worst counts against them carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in jail.
Of the 42 individual defendants, 24 have cut deals with prosecutors, hoping for lighter sentences in exchange for cooperating and confessing to a pared-down number of charges.
Two were sentenced last month: Guatemalan ex-soccer official Hector Trujillo to eight months, and British-Greek accountant Costas Takkas to 15 months, 10 of which he has already served.
In some ways he destroyed his country, Chen said at Trujillo's sentencing on October 25. Soccer is the national love and a patriotic endeavor... He should have known better.
The other 22 await sentencing, led by Jeffrey Webb, of the Cayman Islands, who admitted to receiving more than $6 million in bribes and whose millionaire lifestyle while under house arrest -- quaffing champagne, gambling and partying -- has infuriated FIFA's lawyers.
The final 15 defendants remain in their home countries, either charged or being tried for similar crimes, or fighting extradition to the United States -- such as former FIFA vice president Jack Warner, who was suspended for life by the FIFA Ethnics Committee.
FIFA still owes me money, a defiant Webb told AFP last week. I have just began to initiate moves to get what is owed to me, because if (Sepp) Blatter and others are getting theirs, why not me
Blatter was about to be re-elected president of FIFA at the time of the Zurich arrests, but the ensuing investigation ultimately precipitated his downfall.
He has since been banned from soccer for six years, and his former heir apparent, Michel Platini, for four years.
The US government began the investigation in 2011, after agents discovered that Chuck Blazer, a former member of FIFA's executive committee, had failed to pay income tax for more than a decade.
Blazer agreed to cooperate with the FBI and wore a bugged key chain to record incriminating conversations at the 2012 London Olympics, to betray his old friends in exchange for a reduced sentence.
He died of cancer in July.  AFP

The petitioner stated that she is a devout practising Buddhist, who has attended meditation retreats in Nepal, Thailand, Cambodia and India.
She stated that as a personal expression of her devotion to the Buddhist teachings, displaying a tattoo of the likeness of Lord Buddha seated on a lotus flower on her upper right arm; accordingly she is aware that there are many followers of the Buddhist path who display such tattoos as a mark of respect and reverence to their religious leader.
She stated that she visited Sri Lanka on two occasions and possessed the same tattoo and had no hindrance in displaying it on those occasions.
The petitioner stated that she arrived at the Katunayake International Airport on April 21, 2014 at or around 5.00am. She stated that an individual purporting to be a Civil Defence Officer initially informed her that her tattoo was unacceptable and asked her to the nearest police station.
She said she was deprived of her liberty to continue with her travel in Sri Lanka. The petitioner stated that on April 21 at around 10.30 am she was taken to the Negombo Magistrates Court and detained behind bars with several other female suspects. She stated that she was detained at the prison and transformed to the detention centre.
She said she was detained for two nights at the Mirihana immigration detention camp. She stated that she was escorted to the Airport by officers of the Immigration Department and her thumbprint was obtained. The petitioner stated that she met her friend at the airport and she was checked into the business class whereas her friend checked into the economy class of Sri Lanka Airlines flight to London.
She said her passport was kept in the custody of a member of the cabin crew of the flight during the entirety of the flight and returned to the petition upon landing in the United Kingdom.
She stated that the unlawful detention has been based on order made by the Magistrate who had made the order without any jurisdiction whatsoever and without fair inquiry.

Glyphosate ban worsens farmer woes
Sri Lanka agriculture sector, tea industry and paddy farmers are facing tremendous financial hardships due to the ban of Glyphosate, a widely-used weedicide in over 118 counties worldwide for over a period of 40 years.
CropLife Sri Lanka, with a membership consisting of 30 companies, representing the crop protection industry in the country is part of a global initiative to ensure sustainability of agriculture says that due to the ban income of farmers have decreased as there is no alternative.
The government banned Glyphosate without doing a proper study and irony is that its being used in Europe, USA, Australia New Zealand and in over 118 countries. While many have tried to paint glyphosate as a danger to consumers, in reality glyphosate is one of the safest and most effective herbicides ever developed, Senarath Kiriwaththuduwage, CropLife Sri Lanka Spokesperson said.
It revolutionise farming through effective control of weeds, and compared to many other commonly used pesticides and herbicides. It also has a substantial role in mitigating soil erosion by minimizing the need for land preparation. Additionally, glyphosate is also used intensively in plantation crops especially for tea plantations and is still considered one of the safest available herbicides.
We agree that pesticides needs to be regulated to ensure people and the environment are protected - but decisions must be based on the real risks so that our farmers are not needlessly stopped from using appropriate products to protect their crops, Kiriwaththuduwage added.
Major global regulatory bodies having thoroughly studied glyphosate through exhaustive reviews of all available scientific data and concluded that it was unlikely to cause a health risk to humans or to the environment, and has no relation to Chronic Kidney Disease (CDK) afflicting Sri Lankans.
Saman Premalal Secretary, CropLife said that with the ban, the local maize growing area has reduced drastically from 120, 000 hectares s to 40,000 resulting in huge imports.
It gave the farmers a good alternative income between two major seasons since maize could be cultivated in just three months by spraying glycoside and little amount of fertilizer with maize seeds generating around Rs. 90, 000 income by selling it to poultry food manufactures. But this source of income has now dried up. This is also the case with tea, paddy and onions and other crops.
CropLife Sri Lanka is a member of CropLife Asia, one of six regional associations of CropLife International, a network of regional and national associations in 91 countries.

Government focused on business climate improvements - DBI and beyond
* Specific measures for 2017/2018 underway; improvements visible next year
* Focus is not only on DB Index but also broader investment climate reforms
* Strong progress being made on starting a business, land availability, BOI approvals
The Government of Sri Lanka continues to take seriously the improvement of the climate for business in the country, and is taking concrete steps towards this. The latest edition of the World Banks Doing Business Index (DBI) rankings show a one spot drop in the countrys rankings, and we are very mindful of the need to accelerate our efforts; especially in light of the rapid improvements being made by other countries in this region.
Under the auspices of the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, the reform of the business climate is being tackled through multiple approaches, as this statement outlines. The reporting period for the DBI just released ended in April 2017, and was prior to many of these reform initiatives being initiated. It is expected that the ongoing work outlined below will reflect favourably in next years DBI report.
Progress on DBI Reforms
The positive news is that government officials are already hard at work to improve specific bottlenecks in the business climate. Since the Prime Minister launched the Roadmap for Investment Climate Reforms in July this year (supported by the World Bank), eight teams of government officials representing public service delivery agencies have been working on eight high-priority doing business sub-indicators  Starting a business, Dealing with construction permits, Registering a property, Getting credit, Trading across borders, Enforcing contracts, Resolving insolvency, and Protecting minority investors.
There are several actions being undertaken leading to major reforms. The removal of the stamp duty on newly issued shares in 2017 is one such move.
A third commercial court in the Western Province will be established by end 2017. The Registrar of Companies (RoC) has started simplifying business registration by introducing an electronic system linking public agencies, and up to now around 50% of the new system has been developed.
Recognising the need to revamp Sri Lankas land registration system, steps are underway for the Registrar General to register a property faster by introducing an electronic system at the Land Registry in Colombo.
The digitization of records at the Land Registry is currently ongoing, and by next year all 45 land registers will be completed. In dealing with construction permits, the internal review process for issuing building permits is currently being streamlined after having systematically mapped out the multiple clearances previously required from multiple agencies.
Although these tasks are being implemented in a phased manner, all agencies have been urged to implement the agreed reform actions expeditiously. The task managers of each of the components, and the heads of the respective agencies, have been given the responsibility to fast track the implementation process.
Under the eight priority sub-indicators, 15 specific measures to be taken, and the timeframe, responsible agency, and outcomes have been identified accordingly.
Outcomes for mid-2018 include providing a one-day service for company registration to reduce the time taken to register a company from the current nine days to one day (under the Starting a business pillar); introducing a streamlined online system to reduce the number of days for construction permit issuance from 115 days to 60 days; and introducing a searchable e-land registry to enable property registration in five days with two steps rather than the current 51 days with nine steps.
The blueprint of the long-awaited National Single Window will be completed by June 2018 paving the way to establish a system that integrates more than 20 agencies dealing with various clearances/approvals in trading across borders.
The Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade is continuously monitoring this reform process, and is reporting on the progress to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Economic Management.
Investment Climate Reforms Beyond the DB Index
The Government is conscious that concerns of existing companies and new investors go beyond what is measured by the DB index, and wider investment climate issues need to be addressed.
For this, it was important to have a systematic and continual approach to doing business reforms, beyond changes to specific legislation and procedure alone (as reflected in DBI rankings). Moreover, the DBI only measures the ease of doing business in a countrys largest commercial city  in Sri Lankas case, Colombo. The Government is committed to improving the business climate for entrepreneurs across the country and promoting foreign investment in all provinces.
Outreach to current and prospective investors
Over the past year alone, the government has been in constant contact with businesses, and is already helping solve the issues preventing them from growing and creating more jobs. Officials in agencies under the Ministry, with technical support from Harvard Universitys Centre for International Development, have engaged with over 450 local and foreign companies in the past year to identify their issues and begin to address them.
Officials of the Board of Investment and the Export Development Board have engaged with 100+ local companies, with a special focus on new and non-traditional export sectors).
Officials of the BOI and Commercial Attaches in our overseas diplomatic missions have engaged with 350+ global companies in targeted new sectors, including those who are strongly considering investing in Sri Lanka.
This has resulted in several outcomes: 1) Identification of top issues preventing transformative, export-catalysing investment; 2) Generation of leads for new investment and re-investment; and 3) Re-orienting government services to be more proactive in reaching out to investors and solving their issues, rather than waiting for investors to come to us.
Resolving land issues
A team of BOI officials have begun to address the difficulty of businesses in finding locations to set up their establishments. They identified that there is underutilized land held by the government that can be allocated for businesses activity without compromising environmental sustainability; while other available land is often prohibitively expensive, or lacking in the infrastructure businesses need. The team evaluated over 100 sites from multiple government agencies, combining GIS and satellite image analysis with on-site inspections for most.
They have now identified 29 suitable sites across seven provinces, matching the infrastructure and labour available to the requirements of new strategic sectors.
Out of these sites, several sites are now in pre-development as industrial and commercial zones, through BOI and in partnership with top international zones development companies (as PPPs). Once on stream, the Government will soon be able to offer high quality locations to domestic and foreign investors, in multiple locations across Sri Lanka.
National Export Strategy
Under the forthcoming National Export Strategy (NES), sector-specific Plans of Action (PoA) have identified business climate bottlenecks that are to be addressed in six priority export sectors of processed food and beverage; spices and concentrates, electronics, boat building, IT-BPM, and wellness tourism.
Specific activities relating to reform of regulatory and procedural issues have been identified, together with the responsible agency (and supporting agencies), targeted outcome, and timelines.
These will get underway once the Cabinet of Ministers adopts the NES by December this year.
Accelerating investment approvals and facilitating FDI
In the past, entrepreneurs hoping to start a BOI company often faced uncertainties and delays.
The BOI is currently working to improve investment approvals and facilitation. A new tax incentives regime consolidated under the new Inland Revenue Act removes blanket tax holidays, and replaced it with investment relief and accelerated depreciation.
The new incentives regime is investment-based rather than profit-based and focuses on bringing companies willing to make real investments and create more jobs in Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, commitments made under existing agreements are being maintained, to ensure investor confidence.
Secondly, the approvals mechanism at BOI has been improved to avoid the time lag for initial appraisal  a problem frequently cited by many investors.
The BOI now uses a template developed in consultation with McKinsey to screen all applications, assesses quality of investors through a more robust and holistic approach, and provide responses to new applicants as soon as possible.
Subsequently, as a project proposal comes in, it is submitted to the Single Window Investment Approval Committee (SWIAC) appointed by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management to evaluate and take a decision on approval.
Furthermore, the projects approved by SWIAC are referred to an Investment Facilitation Committee (IFC) chaired by an Advisor to the Prime Minister to fast track the external approvals/clearances involved and to address ongoing bottlenecks hampering projects.
The heads of all relevant institutions are called in to this weekly forum and are expected to offer solutions right away.
The BOI is now working with the World Bank to develop a virtual one stop shop so that all key agency approvals can be obtained virtually.
The approval processes of those individual agencies have been mapped and there will be consensus reached between those agencies and BOI on the simplest or shortest possible mechanism to grant approvals.
These are examples of just some of the many ongoing measures the Government is taking to improve the business climate in Sri Lanka  for domestic enterprises as well as foreign investors - through legal, regulatory and procedural improvements.
While this is an ongoing process and benefits will take time to materialize, positive results are already being seen. Internal reports suggest FDI in the first half of 2017 is up by around 80% versus last year.
The Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade remains committed to this work, together with other stakeholders in government, and is confident that these reform efforts will demonstrate results steadily and noticeably over time.

Have a healthy baby
Transferring just one  rather than multiple  fertilized donor eggs doubles the chances of a healthy birth, according to a new study. Using IVF increases the odds of having twins or multiples, which in turn increases the likelihood that the babies will be born premature and underweight.
Many women choose to have multiple embryos transferred in IVF in order to save money and improve their chances of getting pregnant. But in light of the studys findings, the authors urge women to use only one embryo.
The University of Colorado and Duke University study is the largest to date to look at outcomes of pregnancies using fresh and frozen donor eggs.
IVF - in vitro fertilization - has been around since the late 1970s, but with the advent of reliable cryogenic freezing technology, more and more women have been choosing to use cheaper frozen donor eggs, or even freezing their own.
In traditional IVF using fresh eggs, the donor egg is immediately fertilized with a semen sample and then inserted into the uterus of the hopeful mother. For the process to work, not only do donor, doctor, father and recipient have to move quickly, but the egg donor and recipient have to have their hormonal schedules synced up.
Frozen eggs can be cryogenically stored for up to 15 years, and are ready to be fertilized as soon as they have thawed. Egg-freezing is now a commercially available service, but using them for IVF was still an experimental procedure up until 2013, says study co-author and Duke University medical director of reproductive technologies Dr Jennifer Eaton.
Women have even begun flocking to clinics to freeze their own eggs in order to focus on their careers while preserving their chances of having a healthy baby later in life.
Cryobanks, unsurprisingly have touted the practice as just as effective, and much affordable and simple than the use of live eggs. But, the practice is so new that there hasnt been enough data to prove whether or not it works just as well as IVF with fresh eggs.
The Colorado and Duke study is the first comprehensive comparison of the two methods, comparing out comes for 30,000 patients who underwent IVF between 2012 and 2014.
We now know that using frozen bank eggs has no negative outcomes, as compared to using fresh eggs, Dr Eaton says.
According to her study, fresh donor eggs are slightly more likely to successfully implant in the recipients uterus and result in a live birth, but the outcome is not clinically significant.
There are elevated risks for multiple births, and babies that are premature and have low birth rates for both forms of IVF, but especially for those who use fresh donor eggs. This deserves more attention, the study authors write.

How the KKK shaped modern comic book superheroes
When innocent people are brutalized, villains go unpunished, and corrupt police fail to act, a hero must rise to save the country he loves. His secret identity hidden behind a mask, the Grand Dragon leads his team of loyal companions in a battle to restore law and order.
This plot structure is familiar to anyone with a passing awareness of superhero formulas, but the specific hero, the Grand Dragon, is unknown except to readers of Thomas Dixon, Jr.s once bestselling novel, The Clansman: An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan. Dixon, while claiming to have taken no liberty with any essential historical fact, recounts a version of the post-Civil War period in which the heroic Klan rescues the victimized South from the villainy of Negro rule. Although Dixon is relatively unknown today, and no longer deserving of respectful prominence in the history of American popular culture, biographer Anthony Slide likens him to John Grisham as an author who once commanded a major American audience. Dixons 1905 novel became the source for D. W. Griffiths more enduring but equally racist adaptation, The Birth of a Nation, a film so influential that it incited the reformation of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) with its 1915 release. Although both Dixon and Griffiths white supremacist rewriting of history is now reviled, their masked vigilantes entered the American consciousness as admired figures, and the Klansmens characteristicsas introduced by Dixon, adapted by Griffith, and also emulated by actual KKK members across the U.S.shaped comic book superheroes.
Supremacist roots
Working in a different medium more than three decades after Dixon, Siegel and Shuster, two young urban Jewish men of immigrant parents, were anything but sympathetic to Klan ideology. But by the mid-1930s, KKK hero tropes had been absorbed into popular culture, distanced from their white supremacist roots, and reproduced as generic formula in pulp adventure fiction. Ben Cameron, a.k.a the Grand Dragon, represents the earliest 20th-century incarnation of an American vigilante hero who assumes a costumed alias to hide his identity while waging his war for goodthe formula adopted by Siegel and Shuster, the creators of Superman.
Dixon did not invent the figure of the costumed superhero, but the character typeas traced from The Clansman through The Birth of a Nation and the second Klan to pulp fiction and early comic bookswas popularized by Dixons vision. The superhero, despite the characters evolution into a champion of the oppressed, partly originated from an oppressive, racist impulse in American culture, and the formula codifies an ethics of vigilante extremism that still contradicts the superheros purported social mission.
The superhero does not simply save the worldhe restores a moral, nationalistic status quo.
Numerous writers have drawn likenesses between superheroes and the KKK. After noting the criminal need for disguised identities, specifically referencing the Ku Klux Klan and its hooded cross burners, Danny Fingeroth observes how the idea of disguise is a staple, indeed one of the very definitions of the superhero mythos; however, Fingeroth only superficially links superheroes with the Klan in a list of disguised identities that includes graffiti artists and crank callers. Bradford W. Wright observes that some of the very first critiques of superheroes recognized their vigilantism and how their violence was portrayed as supposedly essential to society. The lawful processes of police and courts have disappeared, objects James Frank Vlamos, in a 1941 American Mercury editorial, and only the heroism of the superhero keeps us from being annihilated; the superhero is a law unto himself. When Hal Blythe and Charlie Sweet analyzed comic book narrative structures 40 years later, they came to the same conclusion: the initiating menace is so powerful it is more than the victim, the authorities or society can handle. The Commissioner Gordons of the world, realizing their impotence in the face of the overwhelming threat, summon the superhero. Accordingly, the reader does not care how often the superhero transgresses mans petty laws, for the hero operates under a higher law that always has the ultimate good of society at its center. Mike S. Dubose examines comic book vigilantism in relation to Reagan-era political conservatism, concluding that true heroship did not occur without defining oneself as an entity separate from the powers that be and transcending traditional notions of law, order, and justice. Dubose limits his discussion to the 1980s, but his description applies equally to the Dixon-era Klan and to the superhero in most of its evolving incarnations.
Large scale
After observing that the superhero is a kind of criminala vigilante, Geoff Klock concludes that:
masked crime fighters differ from the Ku Klux Klan only in that they are usually afforded socially acceptable status on a large scale. As masked men who take the law into their own hands the superhero comes dangerously close to some of the great evils in American history.
The difference that Klock asserts, however, is historically inaccurate. The KKK was, in fact, afforded socially acceptable status on a very large scale. It operated on the same principle that Blythe and Sweet articulate for the superhero: overstepping lawful processes to combat perceived menaces for the supposed good of society. As a result, the Klan rose to national popularity in the early 1920s, receiving the same favorable status that Klock attributes to the later, fictional character type. Sean McCann cites an example of a pro-Klan short story published in Black Mask magazine in 1923 in which members rescue a kidnapping victim and are lauded by a sheriff for their mission to do goodeven with violence. Historian Richard K. Tucker details the similarly positive reaction the Klan received nationwide:
Mainline Protestant ministers often praised the Klan from their pulpits. Reformers welcomed it to vice-ridden communities to clean up things. Prohibitionists and the Anti-Saloon League supported it as a force against the Demon Rum. Most of all, millions saw it as a protection against the Pope of Rome, who, they believed, was threatening to take over America.

Institutional and HNI investors dominate activity
The Bourse continued its upward momentum as the ASPI increased by 8.56 points (or +0.13%) to close at 6,621.47 points, while the S&P SL20 Index also increased by 25.91 points (or +0.67%) to close at 3,898.41 points.
Turnover and market capitalization
Commercial Bank was the highest contributor to the weeks turnover value, contributing LKR 1.53Bn or 29.20% of total turnover value.
JKH followed suit, accounting for 15.86% of turnover (value of LKR 0.83Bn) while Sampath Bank contributed LKR 0.64Bn to account for 12.14% of the weeks turnover.
Total turnover value amounted to LKR 5.25Bn (cf. last weeks value of LKR 4.17Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR 1.31Bn (+57.63% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of LKR 0.83Bn.
Market capitalization meanwhile, increased by 0.13% W-o-W (or LKR 3.89Bn) to LKR 3,010.62Bn cf. LKR 3,006.73Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Banking, Finance & Insurance Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 56.51% (or LKR 2.97Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by Commercial Bank, Sampath Bank, Central Finance,HNB & Orient Finance which accounted for 89.78% of the sectors total turnover.
The Diversified Sector meanwhile accounted for 20.01% (or LKR 1.05Bn) of the total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by JKH & Hemas Holdings which accounted for 88.31% of the sector turnover.
The Beverage, Food & Tobacco Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 8.84% (or LKR 0.46Bn) to the market driven by Lion Brewery Stores which accounted for 91.49% of the sector turnover.
Liquidity (in volume terms)
The Banking, Finance & Insurance sector dominated the market in terms of share volume, accounting for 40.61% (or 38.52Mn shares) of total volume, with a value contribution of LKR 2.97Bn.
Diversified sector followed suit, adding 16.06% to total turnover volume as 15.23Mn shares were exchanged.
The sectors volume accounted for LKR 1.05Bn of total market turnover value. The Manufacturing Sector meanwhile, contributed 9.03Mn shares (or 9.52%), amounting to LKR 0.32Bn.
Top gainers and losers
Central Finance was the weeks highest price gainer; increasing 9.6% W-o-W from LKR 93.00 to LKR 101.90.
Hunas Falls gained 8.2% W-o-W to close at LKR 49.90. Cargo Boat (+8.2% W-o-W) and Bansei Resorts(+8.2% W-o-W) were also amongst the gainers.
Adam Investments was the weeks highest price losers, declining 20.0% W-o-W to close at LKR 0.40 while Nation Lanka (-13.3% Y-o-Y), Convenience Food (-11.2% W-o-W) & Brac Lanka Finance (-10.3% W-o-W) were also amongst the top losers over the week.
Foreign investors closed the week in a net buying position with total net inflows amounting to LKR 0.73Bn relative to last weeks total net inflow of LKR 0.54Bn (+35.9% W-o-W).
Total foreign purchases increased by 43.47% W-o-W to LKR 3.23Bn from last weeks value of LKR 2.25Bn, while total foreign sales amounted to LKR 2.50Bn relative to LKR 1.71Bn recorded last week (+45.84% W-o-W).
In terms of volume, JKH & Tokyo Cement led foreign purchases while Dialog & Vallibel led foreign sales. In terms of value JKH & Commercial Bank led foreign purchases while Lion Brewery & Chevron led foreign sales.
Point of view
Institutional & HNI investors dominated market activity this week, accounting for ~56% of total market turnover amid strong interest in Blue-chip counters.
Average market turnover levels consequently hit a 3-week high of LKR1.3Bn, ~58% higher than last weeks average of LKR0.83Bn but ~55% lower than the YTD high of LKR2.95Bn (when Hayleys acquired Singer Sri Lanka).
Strong foreign buying in Commercial Bank pushed up Mondays daily turnover levels to LKR2.5Bn,
with crossings in the counter accounting for 54% of the days turnover. The interest in the stock resulted in it accounting for ~46% of the weeks total crossings.
Interest in Blue-chip JKH (26% of total crossings) and Sampath Bank (14% of total crossings) also drove crossings over the week while crossings in mid-caps LION, HHL, TKYO & SUN accounted for the remaining 14% of crossings for the week.
Despite the robust Institutional and HNI activity however, the broad-share Index closed flat over the holiday-shortened trading week, closing just 9 points above last week to hold at the 6620-levels.
Helped in part by the heavy buying in JKH and COMB, net foreign flows to the Bourse remained positive for the 2nd consecutive week since Oct 20th when the CSE last recorded net foreign outflows.
The CSE has recorded net foreign outflows just 6 times (ie: 6-weeks out of the years 44-weeks) this year with the largest of them being due to the strategic sale by Singer BV of Singer Sri Lanka to conglomerate Hayleys.
The CBSLs monetary policy decision and the National Budget for 2018 are likely to drive markets in the week ahead.
Urban inflation hits high in October
Urban headline inflation levels hit a 3-year high in October, with the CPI (Base Year=2013) hitting 7.8% Y-o-Y amid increases in both food and non-food inflation.
Food inflation rose to 12.6% Y-o-Y (cf. 10.4% in September) amid adverse supply condition due to the drought/floods that prevailed in the months prior, with prices of key items such as Rice & Coconuts rising notably.
On a Y-o-Y basis, the contribution of food commodities to inflation was 3.71%. The contribution of Non Food items to inflation meanwhile was 4.05%, and non-food inflation for the month increased to 5.8% Y-o-Y (cf. 5.5% in September) mainly due to increases Education (0.87%), Health (0.55%), Restaurants & Hotels (0.51%), Communication (0.41%), and Transport (0.39%).
Despite the increase in headline inflation over the month, core inflation - which excludes energy and key food items and levels out short term volatility to indicate underlying inflation- in October fell 0.1% M-o-M to reach 5.8% Y-o-Y (cf. 6.0% Y-o-Y in September).
Moving Average Inflation (which measures the change between the average Price Index of last 12 months & the average Price Index of previous 12 months) meanwhile rose marginally to 6.1% (CPI) and 6.0% (core CPI).
The increase in inflation levels largely reflects supply-side factors such as the VAT changes and drought-induced supply disruptions.
Demand-driven inflation levels by contrast have been largely stable as evidenced by the decline in core inflation levels over the month.

Kandy out to maintain their supremacy
The Kandy Sports Club was founded in 1874 by a group of expatriate coffee planters and others working in the plantation sector in and around Kandy. In 1888, the club also started playing rugby, hockey and polo.
The home ground was Bogambara grounds until 1939 when the British Colonial Army took over during the Second World War. Later the buildings were taken over by the General Hospital to house its offices; however Kandy SC continued to play rugby at the Bogambara grounds without a club house. In 1949 the Municipal Council released the garbage dumping ground area at Nittawela to the club.
From 1997 to 2009 Kandy SC has won all Presidents Trophy Knockout Tournaments with the exception of the 1998 tourney, where it lost 26-30 in the finals to Ceylonese Rugby & Football Club (CR&FC). They have also dominated the Clifford Cup tournament, winning 18 titles in the last twenty years, which is the most number of wins by any club since the expanded competition commenced in 1950. In the period between 1995 and 2012 the club did not lose a single Clifford Cup title, although in 1998 there was no tournament and in 2006 the club withdrew from the tournament. Kandy SC won the league title for a record nine consecutive years between 2000 and 2009.
On March 10, 2010 the rugby team of the Kandy Sports Club left for a 15-day tour of Dubai and South Africa. The club played one match in Dubai and two in South Africa. This was the first time Kandy SC visited two different countries on one tour.
Kandy Sports Club who were the kings of local rugby lived up to their expectations last season by winning both League and the Clifford cup titles which were on offer and this season they are working hard towards retaining their position at the top as a champion outfit..
They are in search of their past glory and in the upcoming 2017/18 season they will have some of the best players in the country led by that speedy centre ex Kingswood and Sri Lanka player in Gayan Weeraratne.
This season they are under the watchful eyes of their head coach, former Trinity, Kandy and Sri Lanka skipper Sean Wijesinghe, ably assisted by former Trinity, Kandy and Sri Lanka player Saliya Kumara. The Manager of the side is former Isipathana, CR and FC and Kandy SC player Kapila Silva.
Kandy SC must be really happy with the squad of players that they have got for this season having a blend of youth and experience that only have to motivate them and do a bit of fine tuning and the boys will deliver the result at the end. The real concern is that every club in Sri Lanka wants to beat them; no matter it can be even Air Force or CH and FC, because at
present they are the reigning champions. Due to this when Kandy is playing a game they are under tremendous pressure, since they are carrying the legacy of the whole Kandy crowd and their expectations are high, so Kandy SC has to somehow deliver the goods by winning all the games for their fans..
There are many new faces turning out for them this season and out of which some of the well known Schools and National players in Ashan Darling (Isipathana/ Havelocks/Prop forward, Heshan Jansen(Scrum half/Kingswood), Chatura Seneviratne (Fly half / Centre/St.Joseph), Lakshitha Ranaweera(Fly half/Kingswood), Diluksha Dange(Centre/Trinity) , Sanushka

Keeping mum
There is nothing stronger than the love between a mother and her child, and this story is the perfect example of how strong this bond actually is. Ada Keating, 98, has joined her eldest son Tom, 80, in Moss View care home in Liverpool to look after him, and they get along perfectly fine.
Ada and her late husband Harry had four children  Tom, Barbara, Margi and Janet, who died at only 13. Before his retirement, Tom worked as a painter and decorator at HE Simm building services, then located on Prescot Road. Tom became a resident at Moss View in 2016 because he needed more support. Ada and her son are inseparable and love spending time together  especially playing games and watching Emmerdale. I say goodnight to Tom in his room every night and Ill go and say good morning to him, Ada, a former auxiliary nurse, said. When I go out to the hairdressers hell look for me to see when Im coming back. When I get back hell come to me with his arms outstretched and give me a big hug.
Tom is happy with how things are going as well. Theyre very good here and Im happy to see my mum more now she lives here. Shes very good at looking after me. Sometimes shell say Behave yourself!'
Its very touching to see the close relationship both Tom and Ada share and we are so pleased we were able to accommodate both of their needs, manager of the facility, Philip Daniels, said. Its very rare to see mothers and their children together in the same care home and we certainly want to make their time together as special as possible.
As Ada said, You never stop being a mum.

Kindergartner with the most creative Halloween costumes
Meet Momo Lu, a kindergartner from Taiwan whose Halloween costumes are so good, they make other children cry!
This year, Momo teamed up with her little sister Miemie and together the siblings paid the best tribute to Death Note ever. The adorable duo dressed up as Ryuk and L, and they were seriously prepared. Firstly, Momo and Miemie had a stack of snacks the Shinigami and the detective enjoy most  apples and candy. Moreover, the siblings even nailed the mannerisms of the characters, most notably, Ls iconic squat!
Momo is no stranger to Halloween. Last year, she embodied No-Face from the film Spirited Away. Her mom, Elmo Chen said that she spends ages waiting for the spooky celebration, and her No-Face costume was crazy effective.
When Momo walked into the classroom, no one recognized her, she told BuzzFeed. Her friends actually started crying. After school, the best part was when we went to the shop and left with a basket filled with candy and walked around the shops.
Her face paint started coming off, but what a happy day. Momo even said she is looking forward to next Halloween. The wait was clearly worth it. Lets hope Momo continues raising the bar for creative Halloween costumes in the future as well.

Liverpool crush sorry West Ham, Burnley flying high
LONDON, Saturday - Liverpool cranked up the pressure on West Ham United manager Slaven Bilic with a 4-1 win at the London Stadium, while Burnleys remarkable start to the Premier League season continued thanks to a 1-0 victory at Southampton on Saturday.
Liverpools Egyptian forward Mohamed Salah maintained his rich goalscoring form by netting twice as Juergen Klopps side punished a woeful West Ham display to move sixth, level on 19 points with Chelsea who host Manchester United on Sunday, and Arsenal.
Salah took his tally to seven, one fewer than Premier League top scorer Harry Kane, and was joined on the scoresheet for Liverpool by Joel Matip and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.
The result feels good, said Klopp, who had started forward Sadio Mane despite the Senegalese having only returned to full training on Thursday after a month out with a hamstring injury.
We changed our approach, it was a counter-attacking lineup to use our speed from the deep.
Manuel Lanzini had briefly dragged West Ham into the game at 2-1, but they finished being booed off for the second home match in a row.
The result left them precariously perched above the relegation zone and sent Bilic into the international break with question marks hanging over his future.
Im definitely not a broken man, said Bilic, whose side will enter the drop zone if Everton beat Watford on Sunday.
Im very strong. But the situation for West Ham is not good.
Remarkably, Burnley are also level-pegging on 19 points with Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool as Sam Vokes pounced late on for Sean Dyches side against Southampton.
They are seventh, having already won three league matches on the road this campaign compared to one in the whole of last season.
I am delighted to be where we are but there are a lot of challenges coming our way and the group know we will have to work hard for every point we get, Dyche, who has been linked with the vacant Everton managers job, told the BBC. We still have to fight for every chance we get but we are willing to do the graft.
LAST-GASP WINNER
Bournemouth grabbed a last-gasp winner at Newcastle United to move out of the bottom three. Swansea City dropped into the relegation zone after slumping to a home defeat by Brighton and Hove Albion.
Steve Cook sealed Bournemouths 1-0 win with a 90th-minute header while Brightons 1-0 win in south Wales came courtesy of Glenn Murrays first-half shot.
Swansea have lost three in a row in the Premier League and were booed off at the end as they fell to 18th place with eight points from their opening 11 matches.
Huddersfield Town beat struggling West Bromwich Albion 1-0 at home to stay safely in mid-table -- Dutchman Rajiv van La Parra deciding it with a curling shot just before halftime.
The hosts hung on in the second half after having defender Christopher Schindler sent off in the 57th minute.
West Brom are without a win in nine Premier League games and, after an impressive opening to the season, are only two points above the relegation zone.
Substitute Peter Crouch ensured a 2-2 draw for Stoke City at home to Leicester City.
Vicente Iborra opened the scoring with his first goal for Leicester before Xherdan Shaqiri levelled. Riyad Mahrezs fine finish restored Leicesters lead but Crouch headed in Shaqiris cross for the draw.

Three changes to side that beat Pakistan 2-0
Mendis dropped for Indian Test series
Kusal Mendis who began his international career on a high note with two big match-winning Test centuries against Australia and Bangladesh has been dropped from the 15-member Sri Lanka Test squad for the tour to India next week.
Along with Mendis, opener Kaushal Silva and fast bowler Nuwan Pradeep has also been left out of the squad. All three of them figured in the recently concluded Test series against Pakistan in the UAE that Sri Lanka won 2-0.
Replacing them are Dhananjaya de Silva who has recaptured his form in the Caribbean leading Sri Lanka A to a 2-1 series win over West Indies A in the unofficial test series scoring one century and two half-centuries compiling 260 runs at an average of 52, former captain Angelo Mathews whos return to the side from a calf injury was expected and, all-rounder Dasun Shanaka, who like De Silva has impressed in the Caribbean scoring 183 runs (avg. 61) with a century and a fifty.
Kaushal Silva and Mendis we thought need to do some work on their batting and come back to the team. They have been given a fair chance and at the same time we have Dhananjaya (de Silva) who has been scoring runs in the West Indies he comes in. Sadeera (Samarawickrama) we have just brought him into the side so we need to give him a fair run, said chief selector Graeme Labrooy.
What we want Kaushal and Mendis to do is to work on their batting full time with Hashan Tillakaratne who is staying back as batting coach and Avishka Gunawardene (the one-day batting coach). We want them play some domestic cricket and get some runs. If we play them and they fail again it will be hard to bring them back. It will bring their confidence to zero, he said.
After his great beginning in international cricket Mendis has failed to top fifty in his last 12 Test and ODI innings while Silva who was brought back to the side for the Pakistan series after being dropped for the home series against Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and India failed to consolidate his place averaging 16.75 with top score of 27.
We want to give Sadeera and Dhananjaya a decent run so these guys will have to fight their way in. We will play them in all three Tests which will give them six good innings hopefully, for to prove themselves, said Labrooy.
Tillakaratne who went as batting coach for the Pakistan series will be replaced by another former Sri Lanka cricketer Thilan Samaraweera who has been appointed batting coach of the national team till the 2019 World Cup.
SAMARAWICKRAMA TO OPEN
With Kaushal Silva out, Samarawickrama will be given the chance to open the innings with Dimuth Karunaratne with Dhananjaya de Silva picked as the third opener.
De Silva also has another role to play in the side as the number three batsman where he will have to fight for a place with Lahiru Thirimanne who batted in that slot in the Pakistan series before an injury kept him out
Dhananjaya will fit into the opener or no. 3 slot if he is selected because we have Thirimanne also at no. 3 depending on the coach and captains choice, Labrooy said.
On the selection of Mathews, Labrooy said, With his experience and all we need him in the side. He is 100 percent fit but he will definitely not bowl in the Tests but in the ODIs and T20Is. The physio has cleared him and we are looking at him to bowl not the full quota of 10 overs. He will bowl in the T20I as well because if he doesnt we will have issues balancing the side.
We will see how Mathews goes in the Tests and then take a call whether we want to play him in the ODIs against India or to rest him because immediately after that we have the Bangladesh tour coming up. He is more important for us in the Tests at the moment because for the ODIs Asela (Gunaratne) and Kusal (Perera) will be ready to support our middle order, said Labrooy.
Gunaratne and Perera were not considered for the Indian Test series as they were short of match practice after recovering from their injuries. They are expected to play in the upcoming under 23 tournament where each team is allowed a minimum of five senior players. Labrooy said that Shanaka has been picked to play the role of a medium-paced all-rounder in the side.
We are looking at a medium paced all-rounder like Dilruwan Perera who is a spinning all-rounder. We want to nurture and bring forward a medium pace all-rounder like how when Angelo Mathews started. Thats why Shanaka is in the side. We are taking only three pacies and Shanaka will be the fourth.
Shanaka who has appeared in only one Test began his debut on a sensational note taking the wickets of Englands Alastair Cook (16), Nick Compton (0) and Joe Root (0) in eight balls to finish with figures of 3 for 46 in the Leeds Test last year.
PRADEEP ONLY FOR ODIs
Shanaka has been included at the expense of Nuwan Pradeep who has been rested from the Test series and according to the chairman of selectors is being considered only for the ODI matches.
Because of his injuries and he has a history of it when he plays for long we have decided to rest him from the Test side. He is fit but we took a decision not to play him in the long term game but to bring him into the ODIs and play him at least for the next three tours, said Labrooy.
We will see how his body shapes up and if he can prove himself to be injury free in those three series then we will consider him for Tests. On the short term we have taken a decision to leave him out and allow his body to recover and then come back into the Test side, he said.
With Samarawickrama promoted to open the batting, Labrooy said that skipper Dinesh Chandimal would be the reserve wicket-keeper to Niroshan Dickwella.
It will be difficult for Sadeera to open and keep wickets. For now Chandimal is what we are looking at to step in as second wicket-keeper - thats a short term option, Labrooy said. Sri Lanka leaves for India on October 8 and commence the three-Test series at Eden Gardens, Kolkata on November 16. The second and third Tests are scheduled for November 24 and December 2 at Nagpur and Delhi.

Multilac marks Lead Poisoning Prevention Week 2017
Multilac, the nations heritage brand and paint exporter, among the only top three global brands to archive lead safe paint certification from IPEN America, joined the global community to mark International Lead Poisoning Prevention Week 2017 recently.
This call to action has been initiated by the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint, a global partnership led by UN Environment and the World Health Organization, with an aim to eliminate lead in paint globally by 2020.
IPEN is a network of public interest non-governmental organizations working in more than 100 countries to reduce and eliminate the harm to human health and the environment from toxic chemicals.
In Sri Lanka, Multilac collaborated with the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ), a social service environmental organisation working towards environmental justice for all through community actions, conducting several activities and events to increase awareness and create a sense of urgency on the importance of lead safety.
Explaining the companys commitment towards a lead safe standard, Mizver Makeen, Managing Director Macksons Holdings said, As a 100% home-grown company we has always been committed to manufacture high quality paint products to meet global standards making a positive impact in the industry, in people's health and safety, and in environmental protection.
By observing the Lead Safe Week we hope tohave contributed towards promoting a more conducive lead safe environment, especially for children.
Commencing activities for Multilacs Lead Safe campaign, the company donated lead safe paint to several pre-schools ensuring the children are not exposed to lead from paints while at school. The event took place at the Cotta Road, Rajagiriya.
Multilac also conducted an awareness campaign in the vicinity of the Castle Street Hospital for Women in Borella, especially for pregnant women and parents of infants and young children, on the importance of lead safe surroundings. Information leaflets and placards were used to increase awareness on the issue.
Commenting on their collaboration, Hemantha Vithanage, Executive Director CEJ said, At CEJ we continue to advocate tirelessly towards making Sri Lanka completely lead safe. Working together with Multilac during Lead Safe Week we put children at the center of our activities to ensure the health of children are protected.
In 2016, Multilac achieved global recognition earning the prestigious Lead Safe Paint certification from IPEN America, becoming one of the top three global paint companies to receive this milestone.It is indeed noteworthy that Multilacs entire product range has also received the lead safe certification.
The companys extensive export range includes decorative and weather resistant paints, water proofing, wood care products and auto paints. Multilac Colourbank, Multilac Platinum, Ital wood, Multilac Auto, Micron and Mitsuko are among its popular brands.

Munro relishing opening role as Kiwis level series
RAJKOT, Saturday: Colin Munro Saturday said he was relishing batting top of the order after his blistering century powered New Zealand to a series-levelling win against India in the second Twenty20 international.
Munro, a middle-order batsman who was promoted to open the innings in India, smashed an unbeaten 58-ball 109 to propel the Kiwis to 196-2 in Rajkot.
Kiwi fast bowler Trent Boult then claimed four wickets to restrict India to 156-7 despite a valiant 42-ball 65 from Indian skipper Virat Kohli.
But it was Munro's supreme batting show that set up New Zealand's 40-run win after their opening loss to India in the three-match series.
I love batting at the top of the order, getting the team off to a flyer with Guppy (Martin Guptill), the left-handed batsman said after receiving the man of the match award.
The way I bat is the same every time, whether I'm chasing 200 or 120. Go out there, stay still and try and hit fours and sixes, he added.
Munro put on 105 runs for the opening wicket with Guptill, to lay a solid foundation after the Kiwis elected to bat first on a wicket that promised runs.
Munro made the most of his two reprieves, on 45 and 79, to register his second T20 ton -- in just 54 balls.
Few chances went my way, but that's T20 cricket, you need luck in your way. Felt good with the bat, but had been getting out at funny times, Munro, who made an impact in the preceding ODI series that the Kiwis lost 2-1, said.
Munro also got the wicket of Shreyas Iyer, who scored 23, with his right-arm medium pace to make India slip further after Boult rattled the Indian top-order.
Boult got openers Shikhar Dhawan bowled, for one, and Sharma caught behind, for five, to leave India struggling at 11-2 after two overs.
Kohli tried his level best during his fifty-plus partnerships with Iyer and then Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who scored 49, but the climbing run-rate got to him.
The star batsman finally fell to Mitchell Santner's left-arm spin and with him India's hopes faded away.

NCE, Verite Research track implementation of Budget proposals
Verite Research has developed a pioneering platform to monitor the track record of the Government in executing the 2017 Budget proposals during the first six months of this year.
The platform has tracked expenditure on proposals with an allocation of over Rs. 1 billion. Thirty seven such proposals for 2017 of total value is Rs. 116.9 billion (which is over 80% of the total value of such new expenditure proposals) has been tracked. It has been found that out of these, information on 51% of the proposals has not been disclosed, 14% of the promises have not been honoured, and out of the balance which have been implemented, 32% are behind schedule, and only 3% are showing progress.
At a recent press conference conducted by Verite Research to discuss the findings, Ramal Jasinghe, President of the NCE, had highlighted the following:
The Government makes many promises and has many visions and plans outlined in different documents. However, it is more important to deliver on the promises, since it needs to realize that being consistent is important to the business community related to predictability in the business environment.Money allocated for a global marketing campaign to boost exports has still not been utilized.
It was promised to establish an Exim Bank, which would have been very helpful to exporters. But it is yet to be established. The tax structure of the Budget proposals has a direct impact on the business plans of exporters which usually covers a window of three to five years. In this respect, the proposals need to be consistent to achieve the export targets of the country.
The tax structure has also to be consistent with the development of the SME sector to encourage exports. Adequate protection should be provided to the manufacturing sector to develop their products to meets standards of the international market place by engaging in R&D, for which tax relief vis-a-vis the Inland Revenue Act should be provided. However, the new requirement under the Inland Revenue Act that 80% of the products of an enterprise should be exported to enjoy tax relief, is not conducive.
Enable implementation of a payment gateway such as Paypal to operate in the market to foster the development of small-scale export ventures.
The Budget proposals of the NCE submitted to the Ministry of Finance in respect of 2017 were formulated after discussions at a forum, including officials of the Ministry of Finance and Verite Research.
Hence the Chamber expects the proposals to be positively considered for implementation.

## Title: New Anti-Corruption High Court

New Anti-Corruption High Court
A new Anti-Corruption High Court, among other crucial measures, will soon be introduced as a part of the governments mission for an expeditious and efficient administration of criminal justice.
Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera yesterday said this new Anti-Corruption High Court will hold day-to-day trials by three Benches, each comprising three judges of the High Court.
Briefing the media at the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry yesterday morning, Perera pointed out that it is extremely important to properly administrate justice with regard to major bribery and corruption cases.
He pointed out that the bribery and corruption laws in Sri Lanka are outdated. The private sector, public servants and politicians have created a web of bribery and corruption. For all these years, only four persons have been convicted with regard to bribery and corruption . This does not mean we dont have corruption. It indicates that laws are not strongly adequate. This calls for amendments to the law, Perera said. According to him, necessary amendments to the Bribery or Corruption Act have already been sent to the Legal Draftsmans Department.
Perera assured that the Anti -Corruption Court, which has received Cabinet and the Presidents approval, will be functional within the next six months. The Sectorial Oversight Committee on Legal Affairs (anti-corruption) and Media will sit every two weeks to assess the progress of its establishment.
In addition, he said the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Legal Affairs (anti-corruption) and Media has recommended increasing the maximum number of High Court judges from 75 to 110, for the purpose of which an immediate amendment in the Judicature Act No.2 of 1978 is necessary.
The Deputy Minister further said that the respective Judicature Bill will be taken up for debate next Tuesday (7) and expressed his confidence that it will be passed without any objection.
He also said that the government is to establish ten new High Courts in several selected districts and in Colombo.
According to the recommendations of the Oversight Committee, the proposal is to establish High Courts in Anuradhapura, Kandy, Gampaha and Ratnapura where a huge backlog of cases has been identified. The proposal also includes a new High Court in Matale, five additional High Courts in the Colombo area and a High Court exclusively for the hearing of cases relating to child abuse. These High Courts will be accommodated at already available buildings.
On the same topic, Deputy Minister Perera said that according to the findings of the Special Committee on Amending the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, the average length of time from the date of commission of a serious criminal offence that should be prosecuted at the High Court, till the date of the conclusion of prosecution at same is over 10 years. He also pointed out that it generally consumes seven years for the completion of the two appeals in the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court, subsequent to hearing of a case at the High Court.
The Deputy Minister also said that the Attorney Generals Department will be reinforced as a part of this process to formulate an accelerated and productive judicature system. Accordingly, he said, the approved cadre for Senior State Counsel will be increased from 118 to 218. The legal officers attached to the AGs Department have many issues. For once they have a salary issue for which we have called for immediate revisions. Then, there is a space problem. These officers have to occupy only very limited office space. We are already looking into solving this matter as well, he said.
Speaking on the Committee On Public Enterprises, Deputy Minister Perera said a system should be evolved where the AGs Department takes all COPE reports into consideration and take legal action if necessary.
Perera also said that there will be much resistance to this whole process.
The resistance may come from people who are involved in bribery and corruption. However, he assured that the government will go ahead with the mission to create a proper environment for the administration of justice in the country.
The specific recommendations were forwarded in September 2017, by the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Legal Affairs (anti corruption) and the Media. The Committee is headed by MP Ajith Mannapperuma.

New Constitution to include Right to Life as FR
The National Action Plan for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights seeks to include the Right to Life as a Fundamental Right (FR) in the Fundamental Rights Chapter of the new Constitution.
Accordingly, the Action Plan denotes that there needs to be a review and consideration of the the definition and scope of the right to life adopted in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. This is to be referred to Parliament through the Steering Committee reform.
The National Action Plan for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights 2017-2021 is an important document detailing the amendments of laws and policies for the protection of human rights.
The document details changes that needs to be brought into effect where civil and political rights, prevention of torture, womens rights, migrant workers rights to name a few.
The need to review and consider declaring English as an official language is also listed as a short term goal listed in the National Action Plan in which the Constitutional Assembly will be the stakeholder and executor.
Accordingly, an amendment to the Constitution is sought through appropriate formulation adopted by the Steering Committee. The National Action Plan states that steps have been taken to provide effective remedies for the violation of the Official Language Policy and that a review is being conducted to promote respect for the Official Language Policy among private institutions and associations.
Where the Constitutional Assembly is concerned, the National Action Plan seeks to include the Right to Life in the Fundamental Rights chapter of the new Constitution. It is noted that a review and consideration of the definition and scope of right to life adopted in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is sought.
Inclusion of the Right of non-discrimination and Right to health in the Fundamental Rights Chapter of the constitution are other mandates of the National Action Plan which the Constitutional Assembly has been tasked with.
The time frame is denoted as short term however no specific time periods have been cited.
Other activities in the plan, include the creation of a special unit within the National Police Commission to investigate and take disciplinary action for complaints on torture orchestrated by the police.
Furthermore, a revision of the time bar to review FR application in respect of Article 11 in the Constitution is sought. Accordingly, the National Plan calls for an amendment to the time bar to pursue fundamental rights be increased to 6 months. An amendment to the Constitution in pursuant to the review is to be undertaken by the Constitutional Assembly. A review is to be conducted first, followed by preparation of a Constitutional Amendment Bill and thereafter an enactment of the Constitutional Bill.
President Maithirpala Sirisena refers to the National Human Rights Action Plan for 2017-2021 as a goal-oriented document in the Human Rights arena, aimed at strengthening the national processes and mechanisms for the protection and promotion of human rights through substantial constitutional, legislative, policy and administrative frameworks.
Expanding the Governments commitment to human rights further, it has been decided to formulate a National Human Rights Action Plan (NHRAP) for 2017-2021.
The Cabinet of Ministers have reviewed the draft NHRAP.
The approved Plan contains feasible, actionable and relevant action points pertaining to ten key thematic priority areas. I am confident that the relevant government institutions and line ministries will take every necessary step to ensure the timely and successful implementation of the Plan.
I therefore call upon all stakeholders to lend this government their fullest support in implementing this Plan, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe noted in his message.

Oil tanker expected to arrive on Nov. 8: Arjuna Ranatunga

Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga affirmed today that an oil tanker with 40,000 metric tons of Petrol is expected to arrive onNovember 8.
The Minister made this statement during a press briefing held today at the Ceylon Petroleum Cooperation in Colombo.
The demand for petrol rose following a rumour regarding an oil shortage due to the rejection of a fuel shipment imported by the Lanka Indian Oil Company.
Minister Ranatunga said that existing condition would have worsened if the shipment from the Lanka Indian Oil Company was distributed without being rejected.
CPC sources said yesterday that the usual consumption of petrol, which is about 2,000 MT per day, had doubled in the last three days as panicked consumers started stocking up on petrol.
In response to the false alarm, the Minister urged the public to use fuel sparingly and assured that the existing stocks could meet the demand until November 9.
However at the meeting today the Petroleum Minister said there were enough stocks to last untilNovember 9with a new shipment expected on November 8.

## Title: President Trump and Japan's Shinzo Abe Vow 'Maximum Pressure' on North Korea

President Trump and Japan's Shinzo Abe Vow 'Maximum Pressure' on North Korea

With hand on heart, Donald Trump listened while Japans Self-Defense Forces band belted out theStar-Spangled Banner, before the U.S. President joined Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to inspect an honor guard in front of Tokyos neo-Baroque Akasaka Palace. It was yet another red carpet privilege bestowed on the former reality television star, whose susceptibility to flattery will be mercilessly probed throughout his 12-day, five-nation Asian tour.
Yet it bodes ill for regional leaders looking to ingratiate themselves to Trump that his patience is already wavering on this, his first stop. Invited by Abe to take part in a traditionalkoi carpfeeding ceremony, Trump flung big clumps at the fish before emptying his whole box of pellets into the water. Still, the two leaders emerged from a series of bilateral meetings singing each others praises and vowing a united front to counter North Korean aggression.
There has never been such a close relationship between the leaders of two countries, Trump said, describing Japan as a very special place. He added that both men were working to counter the dangerous aggression of the regime in North Korea, which he called a threat to the civilized world.
The era of strategic patience is over, he said. Some say my rhetoric is strong, but look whats happened with weak rhetoric over the past 25 years.
It was a job well done for Abe, who had gone to enormous lengths to cement a rosy bilateral relationship. Upon Trumps arrival, Abe presented him with white baseball hats bearing the slogan Donald & Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater in a nod to Trumps Make America Great Again campaign slogan. Given Trumps aversion to sushi, the two leaders supped on hamburgers made with American beef  shunning Japans ownwagyuvariety, considered among the best in the world  although they did enjoy a traditional Japanese dinner with the first ladies later Sunday evening.
Trump maybe a political neophyte, but his host is a wily operator. He was the first world leader to meet Trump after his election victory and did again shortly after he took office. Exploiting a shared love of golf, Abe presented Trump with a $3,500gold-plated driverin November, and they played nine holes with top Japanese pro Hideki Matsuyama under clear blue skies at Kasumigaseki Country Club just hours after Trump touched down on Sunday. I believe there has never been as close bonds between the two nations, Abe told journalists after their bilateral meeting Monday, hailing the unshakable Japan-U.S. alliance.
Japanese unease over Trumps handling of East Asias metastasizing security situation was a key fact that allowed Abe to bounce back from seemingly untenable doldrums earlier this year following a series of corruption scandals. Abes bromance with Trump, compounded by an opposition in meltdown, convinced voters that he was the best candidate to chart the worlds third biggest economy forward, despite a woeful personal approval rating. Abereturnedto power after Oct. 22 snap elections with a two-thirds legislative supermajority and is on course to become Japans longest-serving postwar Prime Minister. North Koreas belligerence and Trumps questioning of the East Asian alliance early in his term also helped push Abes signature policy goals of reforming Japans U.S.-drafted pacifist constitution. There is also growing, if still fringe, talk of developing its own nuclear weapons.
But while Abes coddling of Trump is self-serving, leaders across the region appreciate his efforts at schooling the U.S. President on the nitty-gritty of regional diplomacy. Abe is trying to convince Trump that America is better off pursuing multilateral approaches to Asia that strengthens America, in terms of dealing with Chinas hegemonic regional ambitions, Prof. Jeffery Kingston, a director of Asian Studies at Temple University in Japan. Washington is punching way below its weight in the region due to policy drift under Trump.
Still, the leaders have some way to go on the issue of trade. Japan has become the chief proponent of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade pact after Trump nixed American involvement on his first day in office. Trump wants a bilateral free trade deal with Japan, which has a$68.9 billion trade surpluswith the U.S. During the election campaign he slammed Japan and South Korea for not sharing enough of the financial burden for Americas military presence. He thenaccusedJapan of being a currency manipulator  a charge he has alsoleveledat China.
Speaking to business leaders Monday morning, Trump said, We want fair and open trade but right now our trade with Japan is not fair and its not open.
So it makes sense for Abe to guide discussion toward North Korea, whose escalating nuclear and missile tests are a growing worry in Japan. North Korea lobbed two missiles over Japans northern island of Hokkaido in late September and early October, anddefense drillsare now part of local preparedness training. Now is not the time for dialogue but applying maximum pressure on North Korea, said Abe, who introduced Trump to the families of Japanese abducted by the North Korean regime.
They were used to learn the language, they were used for many different reasons, said Trump. Its a tremendous disgrace. Ive met some really wonderful people who have gone through a lot.
Trump also expressed condolences for the victims of Sundaysmass shootingat a church in a rural South Texas that claimed 26 lives, which hedescribedas an act of evil. Asked whether it was time to consider stricter gun control, Trump replied that Mental health is your problem here.
We have a lot of mental health problems. This isnt a guns situation, he said. Thankfully someone else had a gun shooting in the other direction, he added, saying that otherwise the tragedy would have been much worse.

Questions and Answers
Executing a Power of Attorney in Sri Lanka
Question
Can you please tell whether a power of attorney can be attested by giving authority to act on behalf of a person who is in Sri Lanka Both the principal and Power of Attorney holder are living in Sri Lanka. Power of Attorney is needed since the principal is sick and bed-ridden.
Kamal from Negombo
Answer
The principal being bedridden is a very good reason to execute a Power of Attorney. He can execute it whether he is in or out of Sri Lanka. Ensure that he (the principal) understands that what he authorizes has to be specific in wording the Power of Attorney.
Further, if the Power of Attorney is with regard to a Court case, please refer to section 25b of the Civil Procedure Code which explains as follows:
Persons holding general Power of Attorney from parties not resident within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court within which limits the appearance or application is made or act done, authorizing them to make such appearances and applications and do such acts on behalf of such parties; which power, or a copy thereof certified by an Attorney-at-Law or notary, shall in each case be filed in the Court.
Safety and protection of a child under the law
Question
I am a married woman living separately. My son is eight years old and lives with my husband. I got to know that my husband is not looking after our child properly and he is not sending him to school regularly. What are the legal remedies available to me with regard to the protection of my child
Daily News Reader
Answer
You could complain to the National Child Protection Authority and the Women and Children Bureau regarding the protection and safety of the child. You could also file a Court case in the Juvenile Court under the provisions of the Children and Young Persons' Ordinance. If you are willing to get the custody of your child, you could file a custody case in the District Court or request for access of your child. You could go to the nearest Legal Aid Centre for further legal assistance.
A vacancy on foreign employment
Question
I wish to go abroad and work as a house maid. When I search for vacancies in the newspaper, there are many advertisements on vacancies in Abu Dhabi. How do I know whether the details mentioned in those advertisements are true and the agencies are legitimate
Shahida - Katugastota
Answer
The advertisements on foreign employment have to be published with the prior permission of the Foreign Employment Bureau. The Agencies have to be registered at the Foreign Employment Bureau. When you select an Agency, make sure it is legally registered at the Bureau and it is not black-listed. You could get all the details of your foreign job vacancy from the Bureau and clarify things. You have to sign a contract of employment and register at the Bureau if you are going abroad for a job.
Designated officer appointed under RTI Act
Question
According to Right to Information Act in Sri Lanka, should an Information Officer and Designated Officer be appointed by the public authority If a Designated Officer is not appointed, what can a citizen do
Ganepola - Mihintale
Answer
A circular of the Government of Sri Lanka has specified that where state entities are concerned, the Head of that department or body becomes the Designated Officer, if no Designated Officer is appointed. So you could ascertain who that is, submit an appeal and then come to the Commission. If no Information Officer or Designated Officer is appointed by a public authority, then an information requester could submit a request to the head/CEO (who becomes the Information Officer under the Act) and then come directly to the Commission.
Maintenance for a disabled child
Question
I have a grandchild with a mental disability. Now he is 30 years and living with me. His father is a Director of a company and his mother had passed away. His father is neglecting him and not paying maintenance. What are the legal remedies available Please advise.
Answer
According to the Maintenance Act No. 37 of 1999, a disabled child is entitled to claim maintenance from his parents during his lifetime. However, the disability has to be proven in Courts. If they're not a child below 18 or an adult offspring between the age of 18 and 25, they can claim maintenance from their parents. Therefore, you could file a maintenance action on behalf of your disabled grandson and claim maintenance from his father. You could go to the nearest Legal Aid Centre for further assistance.
Role of a Jury in a criminal case
Question
I am a Law student. Please explain what a jury is and in what circumstances it is used
Answer
For more serious offences, including crimes against the State, murder, culpable homicide, attempted murder and rape, the law provides for trial by jury. In such cases, a jury of seven members is chosen by lot from a panel elected by the accused unless the court directs otherwise. Both the prosecution and the defense have the opportunity to eliminate proposed members of the jury. The jury is required to reach a verdict by a majority of no less than five to two. In cases where the law does not prescribe trial by jury, the judge gives the verdict and passes sentence at the conclusion of the hearings.

Seeing the wood for the trees
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, in one of his rare appearances in parliament, the other day, participating in the debate on the steering committee report of the constitutional assembly, said there was an immediate and dramatic improvement in the quality of life, the availability of employment and education, in the north, in the wake of the development projects launched by his government in that area, after the war ended. Speaking at a function in Embilipitiya, he also said that soon after the war ended he invited Tamil politicians for a discussion to work out a solution to the national question but they failed to respond, at the instance of the western powers and the Tamil diaspora, who were clamouring for his ouster.
Rajapaksa may have launched development programmes in the north and showered other largesse on the northerners. But this was not what the people of the north clamoured for. They wanted to live with dignity and respect, and, as equal partners with their southern brethren. This salient factor eluded Rajapaksa, who, overtaken by the euphoria of the war victory, sought to make political capital, every inch of the way, by wallowing in nationalism.
The Tamils were made to feel a conquered race, with victory parades held ad nausm. Patriotic songs were manufactured by the hour, with Rajapaksa as the centerpiece. The message of us and them was conveyed to the Tamil community in not so subtle ways. Lackeys of the Rajapaksas came on television to heap fawning accolades on MR, who was hailed as the next thing after Dutugemunu.
Soon after the war victory, Rajapaksa summoned parliament and made a hectoring speech, from the throne, that made the Tamils feel excluded, nay cornered. The allegation by many a Tamil politician that their community had been treated as second class citizens was made to look justified, to some degree. Rajapaksa, who had earlier said he was willing to go beyond the 13th amendment and grant 13 plus, in his victory speech in parliament said he would only be amenable to a home grown solution to the Tamil question and will not permit solutions thrust on the country by others, meaning India and the west. He also famously said that there were no more twin races called Sinhalese and Tamils in the country but those who support terrorism and those who dont. This may have been pure rhetoric, but it also conveyed the impression that he was singling out the Tamil community, as a whole, to be terrorists. This was clearly borne out by the remark he made the day following his defeat. Speaking to supporters outside his Carlton residence, in Tangalle, Rajapaksa said he did not consider his defeat as a defeat, since he was done in by the vote of the Tigers, koti thamai mawa peredduwe. This, after campaigning earnestly in the north and even distributing jewellery items to the Tamils. Wasnt he too canvassing the vote of the Tigers
Rajapaksa also alienated the Tamil community in other ways, such as when he banned the singing of the national anthem, at functions, in schools and public institutions in the north. This was seen as an act of revenge following his Oxford Union debacle - a lecture Rajapaksa was to deliver at the OU being cancelled at the eleventh hour, following demonstrations by the Tamil community, in London.
The Tamils in the north could not be appeased by development alone, as was seen by their response at the polls. The jingoism of Rajapaksa, naturally, made the community retaliate via the ballot. What is more, MR is still in this entrenched position, judging by his speech, the other day, at the debate on the new constitution. He has requested the government to permit a conscience vote to MPs on the new constitution. Did he permit a conscience vote when he got the 18th amendment passed, to be President for life
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga did much to redeem the SLFP from the racist label attached to the party, when she was leader. President Maithripala Sirisena too is taking great pains to build amity between the two communities. However a faction of the party, greedy for power, appears to be putting paid to these efforts. It is regrettable, indeed, that Rajapaksa has failed to conduct himself as a former head of state and is travelling the same racist path, that brought about his downfall.
To the aid of Geetha
Geetha Kumarasinghe, who lost her seat in parliament, it is reported, has to pay back all the expenses incurred on her behalf, while she was an MP. This includes her salary, allowances phone bills and even the attendance allowance. It is not clear if the meals she partook of in the parliament canteen is included, and, how this will be quantified. The grand sum, it is reported, will run into several million rupees. Are we going to see our bikkhus doing another round of pindapatha, on behalf of the glamouros film star

Singer revenue grows to Rs 37 bn in first 9 months
The Singer Group announced results for the nine months ending September 30, 2017 with revenues increasing to Rs. 37 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the same period last year, demonstrating resilience by growing competitively and consistently in tough market conditions.
During the quarter a major milestone occurred with the majority shares of Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC being purchased by Hayleys Group from Retail Holdings (Sri Lanka) B.V., thus making Hayleys the new parent company of the Singer Group.
Both companies together have ensured a smooth and seamless transition where Singer will continue to pursue its programmes and strategies to retain its market leadership in consumer durables. Additionally, synergies with Hayleys and its associate companies augurs a brighter future for the Singer Group and its stakeholders.
Group Net Profit for the first nine months was Rs. 789.2 million, a reduction of 37% compared to the prior year (excluding the one-time gain during first nine months of 2016). Operating Profit decreased marginally to Rs. 2,874 million from Rs. 2,966 million compared to the previous year.
Company net profit also decreased 32% for the first nine months to Rs. 544.9 million.
The third quarter was largely affected due to a reduction in harvesting incomes. As a result, the third quarter revenue increased at a slower pace of 8%.
Net finance cost for first nine months of 2017 increased by 44% to Rs 1,494 million largely due to an increase in interest rates. The lower margins and higher interest rates have both impacted group profitability.
Challenging market conditions, notably the continuous drought in the dry zone, reduction in customer purchasing power due to currency devaluation, increased value added tax (VAT) and higher interest rates and floods in the wet zone contributed to the decrease in the demand for consumer durables.
As a result of the adverse conditions, the company too could not increase prices, and gross margins reduced to 29% in the first nine months compared to 31% last year. The increased mix of smart phone sales, which have lower margins, also impacted the overall group gross margins.
However, the group was successful in lowering selling and administration expenses from 22.6% last year to 21.7% in the current year.

Sri Lankas economic performance broadly satisfactory in 1H-2017 - WB
Despite significant challenges, Sri Lankas economic performance remained broadly satisfactory in the first half of 2017.
The corrective policy measures taken in the monetary and fiscal fronts have led to gradual stabilization according to Sri Lanka Development update released in November 2017 reviewing the last six months economic performance of Sri Lanka.The update states that the construction sectors rapid recovery supported by a strong rebound in investment was partially able to mitigate the impact of inclement weather conditions on the real sector.
External buffers strengthened thanks to foreign exchange purchases and improved capital flows. Inflation has risen since the second half of 2016 on account of drought and changes to the VAT Act.
Authorities pursued the economic reform agenda presented in the government policy statements, albeit at a slower pace, owing to the difficulties faced in a complex political environment and institutional constraints on policy implementation.
However, some other vital reforms were lagging; these included, implementing the One-Stop Shop for FDI, reforms to the investment climate2 and trade, SOE reforms such as for Sri Lankan Airlines, meaningfully progressing on the debt management agenda and passing of the Audit Act.
Fiscal consolidation continued in the first four months of the year following the reduction of the fiscal deficit to 5.4 percent of GDP in 2016 from 7.6 percent in 2015.
The VAT changes that came into effect in November 2016 will lead to a structural increase in tax revenues although the budget targets for 2017 are likely to be missed due to delay in implementation of the new Inland Revenue Act and higher than anticipated interest expenditure. Fiscal risks emanating from relatively high public debt to GDP ratio (79.3 percent, 2016) and treasury guarantees issued mainly for SOEs and state agencies (7.1 percent of GDP, 2016) remained high in the first five months of 2017 as well.
Floods and drought took a toll on real and external sectors. Despite important contributions from construction, financial services and trade sectors, growth decelerated to 3.9 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2017 due mainly to the contraction of the agriculture sector. Gross official reserves reached a 32-month high from relatively low levels thanks to proceeds from syndicated loans, fresh Eurobonds and central banks purchases in the market although an expanded trade deficit and low FDIs presented a challenging landscape for reserve management.

The Global Gender Gap Report 2017 says Sri Lanka stands among the 34 countries that enjoy the best health and survival rate, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
President Maithripala Sirisena provided leadership for Sri Lanka to gain such a place, the Minister said.
He was addressing the 25th Annual Scientific Sessions of the College of Medical Administrators of Sri Lanka, held in Colombo recently.
Minister Senaratne said that the medical administrators had worked hard including on public holidays to achieve victory.
Private practice was banned for medical administrators and it has affected their income. Their issue should be resolved by the introduction of a special salary scale similar to that of the judiciary system, the Minister said.
Certain issues cropped up in the field which were resolved. Providing a proper training for medical administrators commenced in the 1990s, he said.
Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J.M.W. Jayasundara Bandara, National Hospital Deputy Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe, College of Medical Administrators President Dr. Neelamani Hewageeganage and other officials were present.

Sri Lanka-China Logistics and Industrial Zone Office opens in Hambantota
Sri Lanka and China have jointly launched the Sri Lanka-China Logistics and Industrial Zone Office in the Port of Hambantota.
The office will overlook the operation of the 50-square-km Industrial Zone officially established in January and serve as a workplace for the Sri Lankan and Chinese staff, Xinhua news agency reported.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said at the launch ceremony on Saturday that the office was an important milestone in the strong ties between both sides. The Sri Lanka-China Logistics and Industrial Zone will transform Sri Lanka into an important trading and logistics hub and attract massive investments to the Hambantota area, he added.
This is the beginning of a new chapter in the Indian Ocean and I believe Sri Lanka will also become a transitional point for China soon, Wickremesinghe said.
PM also said that discussions are underway for the setting up of an oil refinery and LNG power plant.
Other resources, such as steel, cement and rocks are necessary. But these wont stop here. This includes the trade zones spanning throughout Hambantota and Moneragala. We further expect to install housing, hospital and education facilities for the people in the trade zones, he said.
This zone will not be limited to Sri Lankan and Chinese factories but will be open to other countries for them to come and invest and install their factories here. All these efforts will be streamlined from this office.
Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Yi Xianliang, said the opening of the office was an important step as many enterprises from China and other countries had expressed interest in investing in the zone.
Last July Sri Lanka signed a US $1.1 billion deal to lease out a 70 per cent stake of the strategic Hambantota port to China, amid concerns over the massive debt the island nation incurred in building the port.
Cash-rich China has invested millions of dollars in Sri Lankas infrastructure since the end of a brutal civil war in 2009. As part of the deal, the stake in the loss-making port has been sold to Chinas state-run conglomerate China Merchant Port Holdings (CMPort). (yahoo News.)
