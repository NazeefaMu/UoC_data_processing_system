Healthy alternatives are NOT better for you
There's so much confusion surrounding health and nutrition. One day we're told fat is the enemy, the next we're told that carbohydrates are the real culprit. As a result, stores are now filled with countless substitutes to service people trying to avoid things like fat, gluten and carbohydrates.
But many may not realize the missing ingredients may be replaced with even more unhealthy additives. Registered dietitian-nutritionists break down some of the most popular 'healthy' alternatives, and why you should be cautious about wedding yourself to them.
Registered dietitian-nutritionist Vanessa Rissetto said she'd only recommend skim milk, which contains zero grams of fat, to clients who consume a lot of milk. This is in an effort to reduce calorie consumption. She'd also recommend it to people if whole milk bothers their stomach, but other than that she doesn't see how skim milk is more beneficial than whole milk.
In fact, research has shown there are more health benefits associated with drinking whole milk than skim milk. A 2016 study published in the journal Circulation found that people who ate or drank full-fat dairy products had a 46 per cent lower risk of developing diabetes than those who consumed low-fat or skimmed milk.
Although the researchers couldn't explain exactly why full-fat dairy led to a reduced risk of developing diabetes, they believed that the saturated fats, vitamin D, and omega-3 fats found in dairy may have defended them against insulin resistance and helped control body weight.
Also, fat helps people feel full longer. And when people cut out fat, they tend to replace it with sugar and carbohydrates to satisfy their hunger. Meanwhile, another 2016 study published in the American Journal of Nutrition revealed that women who consumed the most high-fat dairy products had an eight percent reduced risk of being overweight.
Researchers of this study said it could be to do with the fact that the vitamin D, proteins and calcium in dairy appear to help keep energy metabolism moving.
Nutritionist Julie Upton warns it is not cut and dry. Skim milk does have clear benefits, she says, since it contains less saturated fat and calories, which drive up levels of LDL cholesterol and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.
Rissetto said that while skim milk may be beneficial for people concerned about their heart health, switching from whole milk wouldn't make a significant impact to a person's diet or calorie intake unless they drink multiple glasses of milk a day; otherwise they're just depriving themselves of the benefits of whole milk.
While many gluten-free products, like bread and pastries are touted as healthy, Upton said these foods are high in added sugars, saturated fat and calories.
She said a growing number of people think gluten-free products are healthier alternatives. In fact, a 2017 study conducted by Mayo Clinic found that more than three million people in the US are avoiding gluten - proteins found in grains such as wheat, barley, rye.
Approximately 72 per cent of those people on a gluten-free diet don't have celiac disease or sensitivity to the protein.
Gluten is responsible for the shape and texture of baked goods - it is what makes bread so soft and chewy. Upton said when this protein is removed, it's substituted with sugar and chemicals to make up for the lost of the protein.
Upton also noted that these products lack necessary nutrients.
In fact, a study published earlier this year in the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics found that, with the exception of crackers, gluten-free foods contained more fat, salt and sugar than their gluten-containing equivalents and also had lower fiber and protein content.
Furthermore, another 2013 study revealed that people on gluten-free diets had an inadequate amount of nutrients, including folate, vitamin A, magnesium, calcium and iron.
'So before you cut gluten out of your life, check with your doctor first to see if you have a gluten allergy or sensitivity,' she said.
Fresh isn't always best when it comes to produce. That's because it's constant degrading nutrients as days go by. So by the time it's purchased at a market, taken home and finally eaten, it may have fewer nutrients than frozen fruits or vegetables.
'That "fresh" food may have been in transit for weeks,' Upton said. 'And the more days it foes without being eaten the more nutrients it loses.'
Meanwhile, freezing fruits and vegetables preserves vitamins and minerals and stops this nutritional depletion.
Furthermore, a 2017 study published in the Journal of Food Composition and Analysis found 'frozen produce outperformed fresh-stored more frequently than fresh-stored outperformed frozen' when assessing nutrient and vitamin contents.'
In other words, frozen food may have just as much or more greater nutritional value than its frozen counterparts.
Many people think Agave sweetener and coconut sugar are healthier alternatives to refined sugar. It is less likely to cause blood sugar spikes due to it having a lower glycemic index - a value that determines how slowly or how quickly those foods cause increases in blood glucose levels. However, Upton said that despite this, Agave sweetener and sugar contain virtually the same amount of calories per teaspoon. 'There's no appreciable difference between regular table sugar and natural sugars on the market,' Upton said. 'I see so many people going for coconut sugar but it's not going to be a healthier alternative to table sugar,' she added. - Daily Mail

Initiatives to improve business climate in SL
Sri Lanka is expecting to make significant progress in the World Banks Ease of Doing Business Indicators as showcased at a symposium on initiatives to improve the business climate in Sri Lanka which was held at the Hotel Taj Samudra on March 16.
The Doing Business rankings is a World Bank initiative that measures and tracks changes in regulations affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a business across 190 economies around the world and has now become the global benchmark for measuring a countrys capacity to attract investment.
Sri Lanka has identified reform actions under eight of these parameters which are starting a business, dealing with construction permits, registering property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency which are key to assess how conducive the countrys regulatory environment is to the operation of a business. Task forces consisting of key members  from both the public and private sector - with specialized expertise in the subject have been set up for each of these categories.
The symposium which gathered together eminent scholars, stakeholders and the top officials of lead government agencies from the public and private sectors who are actively engaged in improving the Sri Lankas Business climate was organized by the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade which is tasked with coordinating the initiative through a series of ambitious reforms to make Sri Lanka a highly competitive knowledge-based economic hub in the region.
Addressing the opening session of the symposium, the Minister for Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama said that whenever the President or Prime Minister and other Ministers travelled overseas or met with international investors they all expressed keenness in investing in Sri Lanka.
We are very encouraged by the enthusiasm shown by these countries especially Japan, Korea, Singapore, the European Union and the UK. All these countries are not too interested in the fiscal incentives we offer but they are more keen on the ease of doing business in Sri Lanka.
The cost of manufacturing or production has increased significantly in these countries and they are looking at emerging countries to set up their businesses and manufacturing plants and the main area they look at is the ease of doing business.
They compare us with our peers and countries like Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam and as you know we are currently ranked 111 which is not satisfactory at all. In comparison Singapore which is one of the best is ranked number two in the world, whilst Malaysia is 24, Thailand 26 and Vietnam 70.
Our aim is to get to at least number 70 by the year 2020 which is certainly possible  as you all know some time ago  about 30 years back  Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam were all far behind us in this area. However, thanks to the commitment of the political leaders of these countries they were able to progress and I see no reason why Sri Lanka cannot do the same. Even India made huge progress last year moving up around 30 places in the rankings.
The Task Forces set up for each indicator have persons of very high calibre and capabilities and are drawn from both the public and private sectors and I am sure they will help us to achieve our goal of rank number 70, concluded Minister Samarawickrama.
Also addressing the event was Dr. Harsha de Silva, State Minister for the Ministry of National Policies& Economic Affairs who has been tasked to closely track the progress with the Heads of the Task Forces on a monthly basis and provide guidance to them to achieve the targets and clearing any impediments that are affecting progress.
State Minister Harsha de Silva said that he was greatly encouraged by the efforts of all the Task Forces and expressed confidence that Sri Lanka was set to improve its rankings significantly at the next review conducted by the World Bank. He also noted that some archaic laws needed to be changed in accordance with the technological developments globally. Citing an example, he stated that so far registering a company takes about 14 days because of a requirement that the publication of a newspaper notice giving a period of two weeks for any objections was mandatory.
All that was needed was an amendment to the law to do away with this requirement. Now the Registrar of Companies has announced that registration could be done online within 24 hours.Another interesting development was the obtaining of street line permits for any construction in the city. There are three permits to be obtained and the individual has to make three different applications at three different times and go to three different agencies to obtain these permits. This was time consuming and causing unnecessary delays and a lot of frustration. We have now set up a single window at Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) to handle all three applications and this will greatly reduce the number of days taken in the whole process and improve our rankings in this area, added State Minister de Silva.
During the symposium each Task Force made detailed presentations of the progress of their work and almost all of them reported significant progress which can contribute Sri Lanka rise up the ranking when the World Bank does its annual review later in the year.
Other countries have taken steps making it easier to start a businessstreamlining procedures by setting up a one-stop shop, making procedures simpler or faster by introducing technology and reducing or eliminating minimum capital requirements. As per the Registrar of Companies, the Starting a Business Task Force has applied the single window concept and automated the online company registration at the Department of Registrar of Companies. The company registration will be through a web based online application process where the applicant can submit their application online and receive the business registration number electronically within few hours.
Online company Registration - Introducing the fully online company registration with the Department of Registrar of Companies by end of March 2018 is committed under the 1st Iteration of the eROC project. Name Reservation, Company Registration and certificate of Incorporation can be obtained within one day.
Single Window for Business Registration - Introduction of Single application for the Company Registration, TIN Registration and EPF Registration under the Single Window concept; The eROC system will capture the additional information required for TIN Registration and EPF Registration, at the point of company registration and transfer the necessary data to the Department of Inland Revenue and Department of Labour for its registration through the System.
Speaking at the symposium, P.M.P. Udayakantha Surveyor General who is the Head of the Registering Property Task Force said, the registering property process takes 51 days and 9 processes at present and by 31st March 2018 it will reduce to 25 days and 5 processes and by 30 the September this year, it will reduce to 16 days and 3 processes. Land records of the Colombo Municipal Area are online through the Registrar Generals Department and a Single counter to issue non-vesting certificates, street &building lines certificates and ownership certificates is started at the Colombo Municipal Council. Further, the deed registration is made fully digital in Colombo and Delkanda areas by June, 2018. Following are the planned reforms set by the Task Force on Registering Property to achieve by 2018;
* June 2018 - Deed Registration is made fully digital Colombo/ Delkanda
* September 2018 - Registration Data will be made available on line Western Province
* Updating mechanism for Parcel Fabric /Through Licensed Surveyors plans coming for approval for sub divisions/New Assessment number Registrations
* December 2018 - Parcel Fabric is completed in Digital Form and linked to CMC Attributes/Land Registry Information/Valuation Department Allowing online submissions/payments.
Countries around the world have worked on consolidating construction permitting requirements in the the efforts to ensure building safety while keeping compliance costs reasonable. Head of the Task Force on Dealing with Construction Permits and the Director General of the Urban Development Authority, Eng. S.S.P. Rathnayake said, UDA has already started an online application receiving system and it will be further developed during this year. Issuing construction permits has been segregated among UDA and CMC.
Established an application receiving counter and helping desk at UDA for manual submission of application and a single application receiving desk is established at CMC as well for ownership certificate, street line certificate and non-vesting certificate. The application processing system has been expedited including site inspection at UDA and a smart communication system via email and SMS has been commenced regarding the applications at UDA while amendments are being made to the existing building construction regulations.
Planned reforms by May 2018 to deal better with construction permits
There are reforms to be implemented by the Task Force on Resolving Insolvency which assesses the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. Among the reforms, appointment of a full time salaried Official Receiver under Section 281 of the Companies Act will be implemented giving effect to create an Insolvency Regulator who is the default liquidator in all windings up, bring down cost and create greater transparency and confidence in the system. Also the Winding Up Rules of 1939 will be brought up to date and new Rules in Sinhala, Tamil and English will be Gazetted.
Of the ten sub-indices which make up the overall Ease of Doing Business Index, it is in the Protecting Minority Investors Index that Sri Lanka performs best in terms of country ranking. It shows the strength of minority shareholder protections against misuse of corporate assets by directors for their personal gain as well as shareholder rights, governance safeguards and corporate transparency requirements that reduce the risk of abuse. In 2018, Sri Lanka was ranked 43in the world in relation to protecting the rights of minority investors. The Protecting Minority Investors Taskforce is expediting the adoption of a policy framework which will bar Chief Executive Officers of public listed companies from serving as Chairmen of such companies.
National Trade Facilitation Committee is the Task Force to implement the reforms on Trading Across Boarders. The two major initiatives are the establishment of National Single Window and the Trade Information Portal.
A Blueprint for implementation & operation of National Single Window will be completed by July 2018 to provide web applications for Traders for completing regulatory requirements (including single submission of documents and data) to enable electronic data interchange between Government Agencies(GAs) and enable electronic data interchange among traders, GAs and port operators for better coordination of their activities.
A Trade Information Portal (TIP) to be completed by July 2018. TIP is a website populated with Legal Documents and Data, Procedure Maps/Descriptions and Information Pages and Commodity Search for traders with services to help launch and sustain the service.
The Task Force on Enforcing Contracts is the body to implement reforms towards making an effective commercial dispute resolution as it reflects the rules of the market and protect economic rights through an efficient and transparent courts system to encourage new business relationships. As Task Force elaborated, so far the pretrial conferences were introduced in Civil Procedure amendments in 2017 and needs full implementation, email to attorneys was also authorized and Electronic Transaction (Amendment) Act of 2017 has permitted automation to be introduced by courts without additional legislation and it facilitates electronic filings of all documents with courts.
Participants at the symposium were hopeful that the new reforms will revolutionize the business environment in Sri Lanka and attract much needed investment into the country which would benefit all Sri Lankans. It was also noted that the changes made in the processes were not just cosmetic ones to tweak the World Bank rankings but genuine changes that would improve the quality of life for all Sri Lankans.

Inland Revenue Act to rationalize investor incentive schemes
The introduction of the Inland Revenue Act has rationalized the incentive schemes provided to investors, said Minister of Finance and Media Mangala Samaraweera.
Speaking at an event in Colombo the Minister said that these moves will help to create a level playing field, compared to previous ad-hoc investment incentives that did not always have an objective basis.
Open ended tax holidays have been replaced by targeted capital allowances which directly reward the investment in capital. Accordingly, a company investing more than US$ 3 million in depreciable tangible assets gets a capital allowance of 100% on top of the regular depreciation schedule.
For investments over US$ 100 million the capital allowance is 150%. There are also benefits for investment in R&D and the IT sector, and for investments in the Northern Province.
Strategic sectors such as exports, tourism, and IT are taxed at a concessional corporate tax rate of 14%. These incentives are expected to be superior to previous regimes of open ended tax holidays.
The government firmly believes that private enterprise is the engine of growth and we expect private investment to reflect this. Whilst there have been recent fluctuations in economic growth, this is an expected part of the stabilization process, unfortunately exacerbated by adverse climatic conditions that have affected the rural economy in particular.
In order to kick start economic growth, private investment must take the lead, he said at this event hosted by the BOI.
The opportunities are abundant and a clear strategy to support investment has been identified. I trust that you will continue to invest in Sri Lanka and encourage others to do the same. There is no better form of investment promotion than the positive experiences and feedback from existing players.
The focus of this government since coming to power has been to improve the investment climate to encourage further expansion of the existing investments and attract new investors. In recent past, Sri Lanka has shown tendencies of an inward oriented economy dominated by non-tradable sectors.
As a part of this economic reform agenda, a number of measures are being implemented to facilitate private investment.
These reforms include the elimination of para- tariffs, opening of a Single Window for investment approvals, promotion of identified sectors for investment, the establishment of new export-processing investment zones, and digitization of public services.
Sri Lankas track record in policy stability has not been perfect, but our resolve to consolidate a set of rules based, predictable and consistent policy framework remains pivotal, the Minister said.
One of the major objectives of our FTAs is to ensure that there are chapters on investment protection. The Singapore FTA in particular sets standard for a high quality, modern trade agreement, which signals Sri Lankas commitment to credible policy reforms, as well as our desire to integrate to regional trade blocks.

Were never going to bed: children rewrite the house rules
The house has the airless discombobulation of a student house in the 90s, the day after a big night out on ecstasy: Decca Aitkenhead
Three hours in, I feel weightless, almost giddy. Im lying on the sofa with my boys, eating chocolate, watching telly, and it is no exaggeration to say that I am having the time of my life. For the first time in eight and a half years, I am not in charge. This exotic sensation of relaxation is completely unfamiliar  and yet stirs a distant memory of who I used to be.
The kids-in-charge experiment began at 1pm, and I cant believe how well its going. In truth Id been dreading it, braced for carnage, but so far it has been nothing but fun. At 1.01pm the boys had raced to the bakery and spent 10 on cakes, before charging on up the road for lunch in McDonalds. Im very much enjoying the absence of washing-up, and curious to see what they will eat next.
Jake proposes a trip to the corner shop for provisions. I float along the pavement beside him, laughing at his jokes; his mood is unrecognisably effervescent, fizzing with wit, and I tell him hes on cracking form. He halts and turns to me, his expression suddenly earnest.
But dont you see This is the real me. Your rules make me go, and he shrinks, hunching his shoulders and drawing his wrists together as if cuffed. But our rules have unleashed the real me, and he skips off into the shop.
Jake and Joes rules
* Decca isnt allowed to say no
* No baths
* Hourly food fight
* Unlimited screens
* No bedtime
* Decca has to play Laser Tag when we want
* Unlimited sweets and crisps and chocolates and fizzy drinks
* Decca has to disco dance when we want
* Email Donald Trump every 10 hours to insult him
* We are allowed to get games on Deccas phone
* Allowed to swear
* Unlimited water fights
* Worst table manners
* No vegetables
Allowed to jump on Deccas bed, to play on a Wii and to pee on the toilet seat
I stare after him, stunned. What if he is right What have I been thinking all these years, grimly policing bedtimes and broccoli and pee on the toilet seat By other parents standards Id always considered myself relatively permissive; Ive neither the time nor energy to be a helicopter/tiger mum. But now, as the tension of everyday parenting melts away, Im beginning to see the grinding joylessness of family life under my rules.
In the shop, I watch Jakes brain struggle to adjust to the heady concept of limitlessness. He dances up the aisles, dazed by possibilities, turning out of habit to seek permission as he reaches for a sack of crisps. Seeing my smiley shrug, he grabs a chocolate bar next  then, like a prisoner acclimatising to freedom, two great handfuls. The only point at which I intervene is when he asks the shopkeeper for two cans of Stella Art Art Artoize.
We come home with 52-worth of fizzy drinks, sweets, crisps and cookies, which the boys lay out across the kitchen table like a gaudy tablecloth spun from confectionery. Our fruit bowls and jars of lentils and seeds on the shelves now look as if they have been Photoshopped in from somebody elses house. The kitchen resembles a reality TV set housing two ludicrously incompatible families.
While the sugar-rush kicks in, an almighty pillow fight breaks out, and it begins to feel a bit Lord Of The Flies. Jake sets up an old Wii donated by a family friend. Ordinarily, the boys are allowed 15 minutes a day of TV after school, movies at weekends, and no other screens, unless a) at other peoples houses, b) on long-haul flights, or c) on holidays where a luggage allowance cant accommodate a fortnights worth of Lego/books/lightsabers, etc. My iPad will occasionally be deployed in an emergency situation, but thats the extent of the boys access to technology.
Having grown up in the 70s without a television, I consider these rules quite generous  but then, the appeal of electronic devices has always been lost on me. Jake and Joe are hoping to use this opportunity to convert me to their charms  and so, at the age of 47, I play my first video game. It is called Bomberman Land.
Theyre so thrilled to see their mum operate a console, I almost want to enjoy it. Instead, Im nonplussed, and very quickly bored.
They get me to play Lego Batman next, but it makes me feel seasick. Puzzled by my failure to share their enthusiasm, they invite their eight-year-old friend John round. When Joe shrieks at him, Were never going to bed! it strikes me that I might need some company, too.
I rustle up some friends, Chinese delivery and wine, and we have the loveliest evening, joyously uninterrupted by the tedium of bedtime rituals. No teeth will be brushed, no toys tidied away.
The kids dont even need to be fed. They work their way through their provisions like locusts, until the house is littered in a confetti of wrappers.

AmCham presents white paper on FDIs to US Embassy
A white paper on FDIs into Sri Lanka was presented by AmCham in April 2018 to the US Embassy said, AmCham President Dr Kumudu Gunesekera.
Speaking at a networking event in Colombo last week he said that this would also help to create awareness of investment opportunities available in Sri Lanka to US enterprises.
Founded in 1992, AmCham brings together 400 members representing 267 leading Sri Lankan and American companies based in Sri Lanka engaged in trade, business, IT and investment related activities between Sri Lanka and the USA.
New mission director for USAID in Sri Lanka Reed Aeschliman too participated at the event.
State Minister of Defense, Ruwan Wijewardene speaking on defense relationships Sri Lanka has with the US said, after 1985 an aircraft career that came to Sri Lanka recently contributed towards pumping 1.5 billion rupees revenue into the Lankan economy.
The aircraft career got thousands of sailors coming ashore and lavishly spending their money here, he said. The minister was speaking at the American Chamber of Commerces (AmCham) bimonthly networking event held at Park Street Mews, Colombo.
Sri Lankas Relationships with the US has grown tremendously. We are happy to have their inputs, advice on the reconciliation process, he said.
US help us build our naval capabilities too. They offered us a Coast Guard Cutter that will help our Navy to patrol our economic zone as well as our coastline.
We have much of the container lines going between the east and the west. Hence countries like China, India, USA, UK, France, are eager to harness relationships with Sri Lanka. They help us secure the international trade lines and communication which go via the Southern tip of our country he added.

Premakeerthi de Alwis
Versatile lyricist
Premakeerthi de Alwis was murdered on August 1, 1989. He was popularly known as Prem. He was a gifted lyricist, announcer and a poet who enriched the print and electronic media with his creations.
Prem had his pleasant and unpleasant memories while serving the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC). He was politically victimised on many occasions. Prem had provided a yeoman service as a lyricist and radio announcer. He had produced beautiful poetic creations and programmes for radio and television. Among them Sarisara, Shanida Saadaya and Anduna were outstanding programmes.
Prem because popular among listeners within a very short period. He wrote his first lyrics in 1969. It was Hada Puda Asune Senehasa Bandune, which was sung by Rupa Indumathi and Malkanthi Nandasiri.
Prem wrote his first cinema song for the film Lokuma Hinawa directed by K. A. W. Perera. It was the era when Sinhala songs were influenced by Hindi tunes. It was Karunaratne Abesekera who wrote Sinhala versions of Hindi songs. Karu was the Prems mentor at that time. Some of the young composers condemned Karu for writing lyrics according to Hindi tunes. But later, those who condemned Karu and Hindi tunes also followed his footsteps and began to compose songs according to Hindi tunes.
Prem introduced a new style of writing lyrics, without copying Hindi tunes. For example, Eda Re Guwan Thotupaledhee and Aadaraneeya Neranjana. He masterfully used the Sinhala language and his literary prowess. His elegant and lively style of writing, attracted a large audience.
Prems songs can be separated into three categories: Romantic, religious and satirical. Ama Dahara Diya Galaa Galaa, Devram Vehere are some of the popular songs composed by him.
Prem revolutionised comedic songs. He chose Freddie Silva, who was a talented comedian and artiste in Sinhala cinema, to propagate his life experiences among the people. Aaron Mama, Onna Babo Billo Enawa and Rukada Balla are some of the satirical songs composed by Prem.
Prem skilfully utilised words for writing lyrics for romantic songs. Obe Dethol Pethi Lihee, Thalawe Wali Thalawe, Tani Tharuwe, Edhanden Piya Maninu Epa, Me Nagaraya Maa Oba Muna gasunu Nagarayay and Kurullanta Gee Gayanna occupy a prominent place among his romantic creations; they are immortal. They will live in the hearts of music lovers forever.
A great personality lived within a small-made body, Prem was gunned down by unknown gunmen nearly three decades ago. He was a humanist in every sense of the word and saw the realistic world in a different angle. It is the secret for the novelty in his poetic creations.
The untimely death of this celebrated lyricist and poet titillated the musical taste buds of music lovers for decades.

From Dennis to Chrissie; until we meet again
I met you many years ago, at a picnic you were present
When I saw you, my heart panged,
Little did I realise that it was the start of a long journey
I walked up to you to see you smiling
You looked at me with mischievous eyes
And handed me a cup of tea,
This was the first of the many cups you would hand me, my love
It took me time to realise that the pang was love; my first love
It was my greatest joy to hear you say Dennis, I loved you at first sight
But our romance was taboo; many sought to break us
It was then that we realised; our bond would never die
When they would not compromise, we left to face the world together
When you left them, Chrissie, you were crying
But never did you look back, my love
Your pain would not die, for you lost so much
But we both proved to be strong, together we withstood the storm
With the passing of time, they did accept us
All united and happy; love stood triumphant
My mother, Ann, met us at the door; she listened and gave her blessing The only woman I had loved before was my mother
On May 15, Chrissie, you became my wife; we were so happy
Five children did we have and we were complete
With our little bundles of joy growing up until that accident
Did shatter our lives; we lost Ruvani, our youngest
Yet the years that followed grew better
Until Chrissie left us years later
Now they are among the stars together
My Chrissie did you not promise me,
That one day, we would die together
I had made all plans to be with you, but now lie alone in the darkness
Then God performed a miracle when our three children did step in
With all their love, the darkness abated
At times, I sit amidst the shadows and close my eyes
And there you are by my side again, laughing and talking
Like the time we first met, as if you had never left
I will be joining you soon, Chrissie
And this time, my darling,
We will never part.
Dr. Dennis Aloysius, Past President, SLMA

During his tenure in public service, he held many key positions such as Treasury Deputy Secretary, Public Finance Department Director General, National Planning Department Additional Director General, Science and Technology Ministry Secretary and Ministry of Forestry and Environment Secretary.

Vidwan Vaidyanathan
A devout Hindu
The recent demise of Vidwan Vasantha Vaidyanathan hurts the minds of Hindus immensely. She was a valuable asset to Hinduism who devoted her time and energy for the uplifting of the religion.
Most of us who are middle-aged and elderly, used to eagerly wait to listen to and watch her speeches over the radio and TV as it helped raise our spirits.
During a time in which western values have become more prominent; where people lack spirituality and worship money and materialistic objects, the service rendered by Vidwan Vaidyanathan cannot be erased from our hearts. She stands tall among us.

ASP summoned in paddy land case
Panadura Chief Magistrate issued notice to the Panadura ASP to appear before court on April 25 to answer allegations made against the police by Lalith Siriwardena, the lawyer of the Commissioner General of the Agrarian Services Development Department.
On March 28, a case was called before court where three persons were charged with filling of a paddy field at Pinwatte, Panadura, without the permission of the Commissioner General of the Agrarian Services Development Department.
Siriwardena in his submissions to Court said a complaint had been made to the Panadura South Police in 2017 regarding the unauthrised filling of a paddy field at Pinwatte, Panadura. The police had not taken action against the people who were involved in filling the paddy field without the permission of the Agrarian Services Commissioner General.
Recently, three officials representing the Agrarian Services Commissioner General went to meet the Panadura SSP at Wellaboda Police Station to check what had happened to the complaint and to make a fresh complaint
The police officer on duty did not give any information and did not accept a fresh complaint. He told the officials to come again.
Three days later, they went to the police station and met the police officer, but he did not entertain the complaint. The officers reported the matter to the Commissioner General of Agrarian Services.
The Assistant Commissioner of the Agrarian Services Department, Kalutara, filed a plaint against the three persons who were allegedly filling the paddy field.
Siriwardena further informed court that he wished to obtain an interim injunction against the filling of the paddy land.
He also informed court that the attitude of the police officer caused much inconvenience to the Agrarian Services Department as well as the officers.
The Chief Magistrate issued an injunction against the respondents and issued notice to the Panadura ASP to appear before court.

Attempt to disrupt Govt.
The No-Confidence Motion (NCM) mooted by the Joint Opposition(JO), is a clear attempt to dismantle and disrupt the Unity Government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, State Minister for Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P. Perera said.
Elaborating further, he said that the move was an attempt to defeat the Unity Government which would eventually put an end to the governments efforts at keeping the Yahapalana promises, including the setting up of the Anti-Corruption High Court, which is to be moved in the House on April 5, a day following the vote on the NCM.
The JO fears the governments indefinable move to set up an Anti-Corruption High Court that would fast-track and hear corruption cases on a day-to-day basis, State Minister Perera said.
Speaking at Sirikotha yesterday, he added that the motion would be moved on April 5.
But this is nothing but a dream since all the constituent parties of the government are united than ever-before at a crucial and challenging juncture, State Minister Perera said. Like family, the members of the government will unite in facing and defeating this No-Confidence Motion against the government led by President Maithripala Sirisena, he said.
Due to this reason, no Minister in the government could be expected to support the No-Confidence Motion as it is not logical, he said.
He however added that there are a few stalwarts of the likes of S.B. Dissanayake and Susil Premajayantha who are using this NCM as a means to join the JO, with the General Election in mind.
They are sure that they cannot contest from the UNP, SLFP or the UPFA for fear of their nefarious activities being exposed in this Yahapalana Government.
State Minister Perera said that Minister S. B. Dissanyake had taken measures to suspend the Elders Allowance and the Samurdhi Allowance two months prior to the election. It had an adverse impact on the Unity Government, he said.
He had done it with a malicious intention to defame the government, alleged State Minister Perera.
He also said that their decision is a win-win situation for those who leave the government and those who remain.

President removed subjects and institutions on PMs request
Subjects and institutions which came within the ambit of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, were removed by President Maithripala Sirisena at the PMs request, Power and Renewable Energy State Minister Ajith P. Perera said.
He made this observation during a press conference held at the UNP Party headquarters Sirikotha in response to a query made on the assumption of a friction between the Premier and the President, since the latter removed some of those institutions which came under the purview of the PM.
He pointed out that it was a part of the Governments plan to forge ahead led by President Maithripala Sirisena.
He added that everyone could see the reforms that are to be made within the government and the UNP well ahead of the Sinhala and Hindu New Year.
The State Minister also said that the UNP has decided to meet the UNP Working Committee on April 5, 6 and 7, adding that, there will be many considerable changes within the UNP.

Barclays pays $2 bn to settle US fraud case
Barclays has agreed to pay $2bn (1.4bn) to settle a lawsuit brought by the US government over the sale of mortgage-backed securities.
The US alleged that the bank had misled investors about the quality of loans backing the securities in the run-up to the financial crisis.
Barclays chief executive Jes Staley said the bank was "pleased that we have been able to reach a fair and proportionate settlement". The bank did not admit liability.
US attorney for the eastern district of New York Richard Donoghue said, "The substantial penalty Barclays and its executives have agreed to pay is an important step in recognising the harm that was caused to the national economy and to investors in residential mortgage-backed securities."Barclays said the settlement resolves "all actual and potential civil claims" by the US Department of Justice related to the case, which involved the sale of securities between 2005 and 2007.
Staley added: "It has been a priority for this management team from the start to resolve these historic issues in a timely and appropriate manner wherever possible.
"The completion of our restructuring in 2017, and putting significant legacy matters like this one behind us, mean Barclays is well positioned to produce stronger earnings going forward, and to start returning a greater proportion of those earnings to our shareholders over time."
Two former Barclays executives also agreed to pay a total of $2m.
Paul Menefee, who was Barclay's subprime securitisation head, and John Carroll, Barclays' head trader for subprime loan acquisitions, agreed to pay the money to dismiss all claims against them.
Federal prosecutors said that the alleged scheme involved 36 residential mortgage-backed security deals covering more than $31bn of mortgage loans.
More than half of the mortgages backing the securities defaulted, the suit alleged.
Investors had included credit unions, pension plans, charitable and religious organisations, university endowments, and financial institutions. BBC News

Bowled over - a life with poems
After being visibly moved by dance adaptations of four of her poems, Dr. Nelson delivered the following keynote to the packed audience in attendance, which included several hundred students from the Norman middle schools.
The title of my meditation on my life as a poet makes reference to three things: First, the words bowled over describe my immediate response to the news I received last year that I was to receive the NSK Neustadt Prize. Of course, all writers dream of having their work rewardedan embarrassingly large proportion of most writers daily thought menu is devoted entirely to envy:
Why did ones friend Xs new book win the X-Prime award, while ones own book lies, with several thousand other books published in the same year, in the dustbin of literary history, waiting to be pulped In my opinion, one of the wisest things writing guru Anne Lamott says in her by now already classic book of suggestions for writers, Bird by Bird, is that all writers experience envy. Accepting that reality with humility, hoping for but in no way expecting awards, I couldnt help being absolutely bowled over by the NSK Prize news. Ive been pinching myself all year! How can I be so lucky
Since I am a poet and express myself best in the words I struggle to shape, Id like to let a poem speak that sense of being bowled over by the blessings of good luck. The poem is from my book Carver: A Life in Poems, which is a biography of the great African American scientist/saint, Professor George Washington Carver. The speaker in the poem is the young Carver, at this time a twenty-nine-year-old orphan, a former slave with no living relatives, who has struggled to get an education and is at a point in his life when it seems likely that his genius will come to full flower as a painter: his painting Yucca and Cactus had won a prize at the 1893 Chicago Worlds Fair.
King Midas
Before I read the poem, l want to make sure you know that the phrase sustained by dew is an allusion to the book of Exodus, when the Israelites in the desert had nothing to drink but dew, and nothing to eat but the miraculous manna, bread out of thin air. I know youll recognize the allusion to King Midas, blessed and cursed with a magic power that made everything he touched turn to gold.
What I had in mind when I wrote the word exponentially was an illustration I saw years ago in a Disney film about atomic fission: in a room whose floor is covered with mousetraps, each set with two ping-pong balls on it. On it, one ping-pong ball tossed into the room sets off a chain reaction: within a few seconds every mousetrap has snapped, every ping-pong ball is in the air (you can see this on YouTube). This is what exponentially multiplying means.
In my poem, in spite of the many disadvantages with which he has had to strugglehis mother was stolen and never found again; he and his brother were raised by the white couple who had bought and owned their mother; he has had to struggle to find schools willing to educate him; he faced racism, poverty, loneliness, etc.in spite of all those barriers and burdens, Carver feels bowled over by his good luck, his sense that hes living a charmed life.
And he is so grateful for the many blessings he has received that he feels he must dedicate his life to a higher cause.
Thats a long introduction to a short poem, but I hope knowing these things will enhance your experience of the poem.
A Charmed Life
Here breathes a solitary pilgrim sustained by dew and the kindness of strangers. An astonished Midas surrounded by exponentially multiplying miracles: my
Yucca and Cactus in the Chicago World exposition;
friends of the spirit; teachers. Ah, the bleak horizons of joy.
Light every morning dawns through the trees. Surely this is worth more than one life.
Thats what I mean when I say Im bowled over. The rest of the title of what I want to say here also refers to my Carver book. But, while the book about Carver uses poems to tell his life, what Id like to discuss here is how my life has been a life of poems. A poet moves from word to word, line to line, poem to poem, and (if the poet is lucky) from book to book, as the poet grows and his or her gift blossoms. My own love of poetry began in childhood, with a two-volume Childcraft anthology of poems selected and illustrated for children, Poems of Early Childhood and Storytelling and Other Poems.
Here I discovered poems by master poets like Robert Browning, Lewis Carroll, Countee Cullen, Emily Dickinson, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Langston Hughes, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Christina Rossetti, Carl Sandburg, William Shakespeare, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Alfred Lord Tennyson. I spent countless afternoons swimming through the words and pictures in those pages, lost in their alternate universes. I can still close my eyes and savor the first lines of John Masefields Sea Fever or Longfellows Hiawathas Childhood, or Alfred Noyess The Highwayman.
My life of enjoying poems began with Childcraft. When I was about twelve, I graduated to a poetry anthology my father had kept from his college days.
I read its poems over and over and began to feel something new: beyond the pleasure of enjoying poems, I was starting to sprout the ambition to write my own poems, to be a poet when I grew up.
Way back in the olden days, schoolchildren were not encouraged or expected to write poems. We might read them in class, and the teacher told us what they meant.
Im a few years older than most of you are, and when I was a child, way back in the . . . (Im suddenly reminded of a time in the car with my family, when my mother was starting to tell us a story about something she remembered from her childhood. She began, When I was in third grade, I . . . My younger sister exclaimed, WHAT You went to school!! Our teacher said girls didnt go to school back in the olden days!!) . . . way back in the olden days, schoolchildren were not encouraged or expected to write poems.
We might read them in class, and the teacher told us what they meant. Occasionally we were made to memorize and recite them to class. Although I remember that my sixth-grade teacher, Mrs. Gray in Kittery Point, Maine, predicted that I would someday be known as a poet for young readers, and that she was the one who first made me understand the concept of poetic meter, I dont remember being asked to write poems in her class.

Bring back the kings!
There is in our harbour of Colombo a race of people fair of skin and comely withal. They don jackets of iron and hats of iron; they rest not a minute in one place; they walk here and there; they eat hunks of stone and drink blood; they give two or three pieces of gold and silver for one fish or one lime; the report of their cannon is louder than thunder when it bursts on the rock of Yugandhara. Their cannon balls fly many a gavva and shatter fortresses of granite - Report conveyed to Vira Parakrambahu Viii, King of Kotte when Don Lourenzo de Almeda arrived off Colombo Rajavaliya-Ceylon under the British occupation, Volume 1 Colvin R De Silva.
When discussing a serious issue it is amazing to note how often we Sri Lankans, fall back on the wisdom of the ancients. The ancients knew better; if only we could begin to think and act like them, is the fervent wish of most Sri Lankans it seems. It may be the prevalence of diseases like cancer or heart ailments often blamed on lifestyle changes, the shaky foreign policy of the government or even the rapid depreciation of the Rupee; the ancients knew what ought to be done, or better, did not do the things which bring about these problems.
What our ancestors ate protected them from disease. So life giving was the foods consumed that they worked like Trojans. Just look at the marvelous irrigation systems created in the arid North Central plains of the island, we argue. Often, modern science confirms the wisdom of these elaborate schemes, especially in the selection of the sites for the tanks and their distributive methods, based on the gravity principle. Some even claim that our ancestors understood that disease is often waterborne and therefore evolved a method for purification, the cascading method. Treating or boiling the water was not yet thought of.
For a people with such a magnificent history, the indignities of the present surely rankle. Practically in every index reflecting development and standard of life, Sri Lanka is invariably placed in the lower middle range, in the company of countries with little to show.
The only way for a Sri Lankan to enjoy a good life today is by making a career of politics, committing some sort of fraud or migrating to a developed country. In our universal despair we seem to get much satisfaction in imputing greater insight to those who inhabited this land before, with an unquestioning certainty and a self-congratulatory satisfaction.
Universal education has now been national policy for decades in this country. We rank high in the literacy rankings, although the depth and quality of that education is debatable.
A large percentage of Sri Lankans have travelled overseas and are conscious of other cultures and countries. In comparison with the times gone by, there are amazing career opportunities and social mobility now. Yet, we do not hesitate to declare ourselves inferior to those who lived hundreds of years ago; by and large illiterate, land bound, in fixed employment and hardly conscious of a world outside.
Investment of public funds
In nearly all ancient civilizations there are aspects that are admired even today. We gaze at the Pyramids, the Great Wall, creations of the Incas, Greece and Babylon to marvel at the engineering skills that produced these enduring monuments.
These builders did not have the machinery and the equipment that we are familiar with. Their primary resource was labour, mainly slaves and draft animals. By trial and error, one laborious inch by inch, they built monuments that have not only stood the test of time, but to this day impress the technology savvy society of today. Many of the monuments of the past; the Great Wall that did not protect the Chinese from the barbarians of the northern grasslands, Pyramids which were only to entomb the Pharos and the religious monuments which were of little economic utility, would have passed muster in the more democratic world of today, conscious of the return on the investment of public funds.
In terms of modern consciousness, the builders of these ancient monuments inhabited a small world, defined primarily by unquestioning loyalty to their monarch and unwavering devotion to their faith. Whatever political, social or even creative thoughts they may have had were circumscribed by these two certainties- there is always a king, and in their faith lay the path to salvation.
With all the research tools at our disposal now, we still have only a meagre idea of historical times, particularly of the life of an average man then. Things were then not put on paper, the way we do now. With only scanty records of basic human statistics and information to go by; population figures, life expectancy, staple diet, ambitions and aspirations; lifestyle, thoughts and concerns of the common folk of those times remain mainly a subject of conjecture. It can hardly be said that the few histories available are dispassionate or objective records. Depending on the circumstances; bombastic, triumphant or even exculpatory, they are not material that the trained scholars of today will hold out as factual or objective. Yet, these can still give us some clues and insights to the times in which our ancestors lived, and the temper of their lives.
Were their lives rich, creative and satisfying or poor, nasty, brutish and short Did they possess a broad outlook, minds knowledgeable and wise or were they oppressed and insular, given to superstition and occult practices
We may speculate, finding answers to these questions based on our own biases and inclinations. However, the fact remains that with universal education and the freedom of rapid social mobility we are a lot more empowered now than our ancestors ever were. Unlike them, making the world in our own image, or at least creating something that goes towards meeting our aspirations is within our grasp. We have the education and the technology. Many countries, using modern ideas and methods have broken out of centuries of stagnation; and give their people a good life, often in a democratic setting.
That theatrical report to Vira Parakrambahu viii is distinguished by its dramatic quality than its factuality. In Statecraft, as in military matters, a clear and factual understanding of a given situation is more valuable than several divisions. For dramatization of reporting, the assessment of the Portuguese strength Cannon is louder than thunder when it bursts on the rock of Yugandhara. is hard to beat. It also carries hints of rigidity of mind and attitude; after all, they were reporting an event happening only a few kilometres away. The befuddled spies had no qualms in dramatizing the story, and it would occur to none in the Kings court to verify the version firsthand.
On receiving the report of the activities of the alien people on our shores, the warning bells should have rung loud and clear in the court of Vira Parakrambahu viii. The new comers had crossed many seas, done many things and were capable of much. If we were to remain sovereign and compete on an equal footing, things had to change. That was not the path we chose, instead contriving to use the obvious strengths of the strangers in local intrigues and plots for short term personal advantage. The ancient Kingdom was now living on borrowed time, surviving only because the European powers, seeing no immediate gain, were not inclined to commit their resources to conquer the whole island. For the weak and divided Kingdom, the end came a few centuries later; not with a bang, but a whimper; with the connivance of many native leaders, almost imperceptibly, becoming a dominion of a far-away King.
Colonial dominance
Five hundred some years since that fateful day in 1505, is the situation any different in a real sense now In 1948, after centuries of colonial dominance, the management of the country was handed back to its people.
One cannot say that the progression thereon lacked drama; periodically new Constitutions are heralded, plush parliaments commissioned and built, after frenzied campaigns new governments elected with a lot of fanfare, ministers sworn-in ceremoniously and all over the country there are grand openings and launches, all these strictly adhering to auspicious times.
Meanwhile, in the corruption index our rankings deteriorate yearly, in the ease of doing business index we are among the countries lagging behind, in per capita GDP terms our performance is less than impressive; a nation unable to break out of its mediocrity.
Despite all the show and dramatization; in political stability, economic strength and technological capabilities, in relative terms, the gap between the developed world and us is perhaps even now wider than what was in 1505.
Is a nation which is convinced that its best years were in the past, capable of carving out a greater future One time, all roads led to Rome. But the Italians of today will not want a Caesar back. The Chinese once had powerful kings and emperors. Today the Chinese policy is firmly Republican.
The Egyptians will make tourist dollars from the Pyramids, but will certainly not have pharos ruling them again. Even the British, on whose empire the sun never set, now dont want to go back there; no more mad dogs and Englishmen going out in the midday sun for them. The present is good, and the future even better.
It is different on this island. We want our past back, and more, the kings ruling us again.

President, PM at Jathika Yowun Pura 2018
Call for unity, collective action for countrys progress
All should work in unity to perform the duty and responsibility of building a favourable society and country for the younger generation, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was addressing the concluding ceremony of the Jathika Yowun Pura 2018 youth camp at Nikaweratiya as the Chief Guest, on March 31 afternoon.
Nearly 7,000 youth including youth delegates from several foreign countries attended the camp. President Sirisena said developed countries had attained their pre-eminent position because all their citizens had worked towards a common goal in the interest of their respective countries.
The President emphasising the importance of all political leaders and political organisations working towards a common agenda, spurning private agendas said, unity and collective action would be a great strength to march forward as a nation. President Sirisena said the government was working with dedication to enable the countrys youth to achieve their hopes and aspirations. Speaking on this occasion, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the 7,500 youth attending the Yowun Pura Camp would return to their villages armed with novel experiences.
The Camp was part of a strategy guide youth on the correct path and enable them display leadership qualities.
People of all communities and religions were attending the camp in unity as Sri Lankans. They should learn to live in unity respecting each others identity. This sense of unity should be preserved at all times with allowing anyone to drive a wedge among them, the Prime Minister said.
There is a great responsibility on the shoulders of the youth attending the camp since the country could not afford to go back to another war and separatist terrorism, the Prime Minister said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe the country suffered a great setback due to the 30-year terrorist war.
He said Sri Lanka was more economically developed than China and Vietnam at the time he was the Minister of Youth Affairs in the 1980.
Ever since China had made vast strides in development and become one of the the most powerful economies in the world today. This same opportunity was available for Sri Lanka 40 years ago, but it frittered away due to the war and other developments, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said communalism would only retard the countrys forward march.
Youth should not fall prey to communalist ideas and hate speech spread by interested parties, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said Facebook was an important mechanism but it has been utilised recently to spread hateful messages. The government did not intend to ban facebook but a system should be devised to prevent it from being misused to spread hate and communalism.
The Prime Minister said a better future should be charted for the countrys youth. To facilitate this the country should be developed on the lines of Vietnam and other recently developed countries.
Tourism, agriculture and banking should be developed to make the country economically strong. It should venture into the international market like South Korea and Singapore have done. For this we should bring in knowledge and investments including foreign investment, the Premier added.
Today, Foreign investors had expressed willingness to invest in Sri Lanka, the Prime Minister said.
The government would take steps to provide employment opportunities for graduates and students who have passed the Advanced Level examination. Measures would be taken to create jobs in the Private sector. The Youth Brigade would launch training programmes to facilitate this, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Minister Sagala Ratnayaka, NYSC Chairman and Director General Eranda Weliange and Yovun Pura Mayor Lakmadu Sudesh also spoke.
Ministers S.B. Nawinna, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Sarath Fonseka, Deputy Minister Indika Bandranayake, Shantha Bandara and Wayamba Chief Miniser Dharmasiri Dasanayake were also present on the occasion.
The Kurunegala District youth Club which was adjudged the most Creative and Best Youth Society at the Yovun Pura 2018 Camp by securing 160 points was awarded the winning trophy by President Malithripala Sirisena.

A pinch of wisdom for Vesak
Vesak is a religious and cultural festival to commemorate the birth, enlightenment and Parinibbana of the Buddha which have happened on the same day.
According to a newspaper report, the Buddha Sasana Ministry will stop organisers of Vesak pandals from lighting the pandals on Vesak Poya day. They execute this to encourage young people in spending more time in temples. They want people to go and see Vesak pandals on the day after Vesak Poya.
I wonder if we can agree with well-grounded proposals. This tradition, though seemingly ridiculous, has weathered centuries in Buddhist countries. In reality, the Buddhas teachings do not count in as a religion or any other dogma. That said, the followers do not abide by strict rules. The teachings have offered freedom.
On Vesak Day, the people organise many religious activities such as dansal, sil programmes and sermons. The people also prepare Vesak pandals and lanterns, and they illuminate them at the night.
On this day, many temples are filled with sil devotees and pilgrims. Many Buddhists refrain from eating meat and fish during this week and lead a vegetarian life.
Buddhism is a path of practice and spiritual development leading to insight into the true nature of reality. The Buddhist practices like meditation are means of changing yourself in order to develop the qualities, awareness, kindness and wisdom.
The experience developed within the Buddhist traditions over thousands of years has created an incomparable resource for all those who wish to follow a path which ultimately culminates in Enlightenment or liberation. An enlightened being seen the nature of reality absolutely clearly, just as it is, and lives fully and naturally in accordance with that vision. This is the goal of the Buddhist spiritual life, representing the end of suffering for anyone who attains it.
The basic tenets of Buddhist teachings are straightforward and practical: nothing is fixed or permanent; actions have consequences; change is possible.
Buddhism addresses itself to all people irrespective of race, nationality, cast, sexuality or gender.
It teaches practical methods which enable people to release and use its teachings in order to transform from their experience to be fully responsible for their lives. Buddhism teaches people how to end their suffering by cutting out greed, hatred and ignorance.

Complete re-organisation of the Police Service - Minister
There will be a complete re-organisation of the Police Service soon. The exercise is aimed to transform it to public praise and minimise criticism and allegations against it, Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said.
The Minister disclosed this when he visited the Kataragama Kiri Vehera Raja Maha Viharaya and called on Viharadhipathi Ven. Kobawaka Dhamminda Chief Sanganayake Thera of the Ruhunu Magampatthuwa and received his blessings on March 31. Maddumabandara said the duty and responsibility of Ministers and MPs is to work for the progress of the people by providing relief and facilities needed by them rather than to bring in No Confidence Motions. The Minister who stressed the need to maintain a proper management of the Kataragama Sacred City and new town said he would facilitate it by introducing a planned programme in the near future.
He said arrangements would be made for the Kataragama Esala Maha Perahera after holding discussions under the patronage of the Vidharadhpati of the Abhinawaramaya.
Ven. Dhamminda Chief Sanghanayake Thera said the proposed Kataragama Sacred City Development Fund to be launched under the contribution of officiating priests of the devalayas had not still got off the ground.
As such finding the Rs. 60 million needed for the Esala pageant had become a difficult task.
He also said special attention should also be given towards keeping a clean environment in Kataragama.

## Title: CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS OF PUBLIC SERVICE
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Monday, April 2, 2018 - 01:00
CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS OF PUBLIC SERVICE
The history and functioning of the vast bureaucracy that is the public service has to be understood within the framework of the three Constitutions of Sri Lanka since independence. i.e, the Independence Constitution, the 1972 Constitution and the 1978 Constitution. The Independence Constitution provided for an independent Public Service Commission appointed by the Governor General. The Governor-General was also empowered to nominate one member as Chairman of the Commission. Under this Constitution, the executive arm of the Government functioned under the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers. While the formulation of Government policy was in the hands of the Cabinet, it was the duty of the public service to implement such policy decisions.
The 1972 Constitution retained the Constitutional Head of State (called the President). However, it brought the functions of the earlier Public Service Commission under the Cabinet of Ministers thus directly bringing the Public Service under the governing political party. It established a State Services Advisory Board which only had advisory functions. It also established a State Services Disciplinary Board. The administrative head of each Ministry; i.e., the Secretary, was subject to the direction and control of his Minister. Therefore the political neutrality of the public service was eroded with the aim of strengthening the executive arm of the Government.
1978 Constitution
The 1978 Constitution further strengthened the executive by establishing the elected executive presidency thereby discarding the non-political Head of State. Under this Constitution, the appointments to the constitutionally protected posts were made by the President. Under the 1978 Constitution, the appointment, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of public servants have been under the control of the Public Service Commission which held authority delegated by the Cabinet. In terms of Article 56 (1) of the Constitution prior to the 17th Amendment, it consisted of at least five members and was appointed for a period of five years.
Reducing the delegated powers of the Public Service Commission under Article 55 is the proviso which states that the Cabinet may delegate its power of transfer in respect of any category of officers as may be specified to any Minister and where there is such delegation the Public Service Commission ceases to exercise such powers in respect of such categories of officers.
Article 55(4) also vested with the Cabinet the task of formulating schemes of recruitment and promotion etc., and codes of conduct for public officers and the procedure for the exercise and delegation of powers of appointment, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of public officers. As provided in Article 56 the Cabinet was also vested with the power to alter, vary and rescind decisions of the Public Service Commission or any of its committees.
Another step in public administration was taken with the 13th Amendment to the Constitution when the Provincial Councils Act was passed in 1987. These enactments provided for a Provincial Public Service and Provincial Public Service Commissions appointed by the respective Governors of the Provinces. By the end of the 20th century, it was the common perception that the decline in the administration of the country was due to political interference. Successive governments have faced repeated accusations of not taking meaningful steps to deal with this malady promptly and effectively. In an attempt to put things right, the then Government introduced a draft of a revised Constitution in October in 1987 and later in August 2000. These drafts included specific provisions to deal with this matter. But unfortunately, this did not become a reality.
17th Amendment
The Seventeenth Amendment to this Constitution was introduced in October 2001 at a time when Sri Lanka was deeply embroiled in the ethnic conflict and functioned for decades under emergency rule. The Seventeenth Amendment was to serve as a break over arbitrary executive action in the control of the public service. It attempted to temper the sole power of the President in making appointments to high offices and the Commissions with a degree of Parliamentary control by way of recommendations. The Seventeenth Amendment introduced the requirement for the President to act on the recommendations of the Constitutional Council in appointing the Independent Commissions and the holders of constitutionally protected posts and the judges of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal.
The Constitution Council was not given the authority to directly make appointments to the Commissions or the above-mentioned posts. The Supreme Court (in its constitutional determination on the Seventeenth Amendment) opined that such authority would erode the power of the President so as to be inconsistent with Article 3 read with Article 4(b) of the Constitution. The Supreme Court also focused on the question as to whether subjecting the absolute discretion of the President to the recommendation and approval of the Constitutional Council would reduce the Presidents power. The Court determined that such would not be the case. The first Constitutional Council adopted general criteria to ensure that persons appointed to the positions mentioned in the Seventeenth Amendment were impartial and independent and possessed moral uprightness and integrity.
The Public Service Commission (PSC) was one of the commissions that came under the purview of the 17th Amendment, perhaps with the hope that it would be able to insulate the public service from political influence and rescue it from the abyss into which it had fallen. The PSC under Article 54 (1) as amended by the 17th Amendment consisted of nine members appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Constitutional Council. Article 55(1) of the Constitution as amended by the 17th Amendment reads as follows: the appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of the public officers shall be vested in the Commission. While on the face of this provision it would appear that the expectation of an independent public service has become reality.
Article 55(3) which reads as follows negates this expectation: Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article, the appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of all heads of Departments shall vest in the Cabinet of Ministers, who shall exercise such powers after ascertaining the views of the Commission.
This shows that the Cabinet retains power over Heads of Departments. In other words despite the provisions of Article 55(1), the public service continues to be the grip of politicians who could manipulate it through Heads of Department.
A significant feature of the 17th Amendment which regards to public service personnel matters is the creation of a body called Administrative Appeals Tribunal with powers to hear appeals from decisions of the PSC and the Police Commission (17th Amendment, Articles (59) and 155L). The Administrative Appeals Tribunal was established under the provisions of the 17th Amendment by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act No 4 of 2002.
The Seventeenth Amendment ran into problems when the then President at the end of the term of office of the first Constitutional Council could not appoint one member. Following the failure to appoint the Constitutional Council the then President happened to make appointments directly to the Commissions and the high posts thus contravening the provisions of the Constitution. Moreover, the appointment of the Elections Commission ran into difficulty due to a difference of opinion between the President and the Constitutional Council.
18th Amendment
The Constitutional Council was abolished with the enactment of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 2010. It effectively gave the President absolute power over the Commissions and through them the Public Service. The task of the Parliamentary Council established under the 18th Amendment was to make observations on the persons appointed by the President to the key Public Service posts and the various Commissions. Unlike the Constitutional Council which had to make recommendations, the Parliamentary Council had only to give its observations on the appointments made by the President. The President was free to accept or disregard such observations.
The Parliamentary Council was also expected to give its observations within two weeks of the Presidents communication to the Speaker. Therefore the Parliamentary Council was far weaker than the Constitutional Council in its bearing on appointments to the Commissions and vital posts. The Parliamentary Council had also lost a good deal of its acceptance as the Leader of the Opposition (and his nominee) had refused to participate at its meetings.
Under this Amendment, the Cabinet of Ministers was vested with the power of deciding on policy relating to the appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of public servants. Article 54(1) as amended by the Eighteenth Amendment also provided that the President shall have the power to appoint and remove the members of the Public Service Commission. In making the appointments the President was required to seek the observations of the Parliamentary Council. The Cabinet under the Seventeenth Amendment had to obtain the views of the Public Service Commission in dealing with Heads of Departments.
This requirement was removed by the Eighteenth Amendment. Therefore the President as the head of the Cabinet undoubtedly wielded enormous powers over the public service, bringing it under the direct political control.
19th Amendment - key changes
The significant features of the 19A include the reintroduction of the Constitutional Council and the repeal of the 18th Amendment.
* Reintroduction of the Constitutional Council and empowering the Commission
* Reduction of the tenure of the President and the Parliament
* Reintroduction of the two-term limit that a person can hold office as President.

Erudition well set
Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful. There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work and learning from your failures.
Vocational and Professional training is an area of education that empowers young men and women of this world in such a way that they are able to excel in their lives and in their chosen profession through the abilities gained by taking part in such a discipline.
In fact since 1981, for more than 35 years Ladies College, Institute of Professional Studies Sri Lanka have focused on vocational/professional training, turning out numbers of confident and positive students who have bravely ventured forth and made a change in society for the greater good.
The Ladies College Institute of Professional Studies (LCIPS) is an institute within Ladies College which was set up with a view to providing skills training to those students of Ladies College who did not wish to study at the Universities. Students were trained to follow job oriented courses. Today it caters to young people of both genders with no age barrier.
In fact, the website of the Ladies College, Institute of Professional Studies proudly states their mission is to enhance opportunities for students to add value for themselves and thereby achieve their full potential.
The IPS is an institute within Ladies College where major decisions regarding both the school and the institute are decided by the Church Missionary Society (CMS)
The Daily News attended the LCIPS awards day and witnessed how vocational and professional training has made a difference in the lives of these students.
Former Chairman of CMS Governing Body and Chief Guest Dr Dan Seevaratnam congratulated students on their achievements, saying that it gave him a lot of joy because graduation from vocational training is a dream fulfilled for many.
It is our conviction that those students who do not want to go to university after their A/Ls for whatever reason, should have a professional qualification. I am so happy that this is now a possibility. The dream is now a reality. I want to talk about values today. Sadly in this day and age values seem to be eroding at various levels. This is seen amongst the children sadly. Core values are the fundamental beliefs of a person. These guiding principles dictate behaviour and help people understand that difference between right and wrong, said Dr Seevaratnam.
Seevaratnam pointed out that in the bible it is said that when you marry you should be equally yoked. Being equally yoked means you have similar values. It means you share core values even though the marriage may be between a Christian and a non- Christian. You have a good understanding.
In medieval times, either in marriage or in your place of work or in your career, it is your values and belief in something that carries you through. Today we see the wastage of resources and the exercise of frugality. Today we waste water and we waste food. Good values are to be mindful as to why you are having a meal because there are thousands who are not having a meal. While you are wasting water there are those who have to walk three or four miles to get water. I have seen this with my own eyes in Ethiopia. It is indeed tragic. It is only when you see that do you see how blessed we are, pointed out Seevaratnam.
The belief that family is of fundamental importance is a core value. Where is the fundamental respect for this thing called the family
A belief in honesty and that trust has to be earned is a great value. Honesty and integrity are vital. You also need to maintain a healthy work-life balance. You need to give your family importance and at the same time allocate time for your work life. You need to care what is happening at home. I have seen this too often with too many people being workaholic. Some values are values that your parents have taught you. Some values are what your religion has taught you. Some values are what your school has taught you. Dependability is a core value. Today people promise but do not deliver on their promise. If you say something do it. You have to be 100 percent dependable. People should be able to trust you to be reliable. Trust is an extremely important aspect of human life, explained Seevaratnam
He emphasized not to break trust. Seevaratnam said that he has faced adversity while trying to maintain his values in life. He also pointed out that you cant judge people by appearances. Some people jump to conclusions without adequate fact or evidence. You need to respect others views.
Even the lowliest person can give you a helping hand at some point in time or tell you something you did not know. Do not lose your value that is what I want to say, said Seevaratnam
The principal of Ladies College Eesha Speldewinde called Chief Guest Dan Seevaratnam a role model to anyone and a man of high calibre. Speldewinde thanked all members of the LCIPS in her address and saluted the new chairperson of the Christian Missionary Society (CMS) board of Governors Thanuja Peiris. He also thanked all donors for their unwavering and solid support.
Dr Dan Seevaratnam our chief guest, has an in-depth knowledge of the plantation system in this country and has undoubtedly left behind a legacy in the business community. He is giant in his chosen field. He has had an illustrious career. He is someone you can aspire to be in terms of conduct, manner and demeanour. These qualities are invaluable. This helps you make a difference in peoples lives. Nelson Mandela once said that a good head and a good heart are always a formidable combination. Dr Seevaratnam is formidable on both counts. I have learnt a lot from him having worked with him for four years. He has a forthright and upright manner and has made an impression. He always taught us to be firm and fair. His flexibility permitted him, to adapt his management skills to cater to each and every school that came under his purview, said Speldewinde.
Speldewinde said that Dr Seevaratnam had a spiritual upbringing and has a focus on god in is daily life.
When he assigns a task to anyone he believes in that person and places trust in that person. He gives that person the space to work independently and offer advice and assistance when that person needs it. He placed that trust in us and that gave us a huge confidence boost. He instilled in us a deep sense of responsibility, said Speldewinde.
Speldwinde also thanked Chaplain Revd. Melvin De Silva on his quiet support and spiritual guidance and being a friend to everyone in need. And said that she has no doubt that Thanuja Peiris, a lawyer by profession, will bring her flavour of professionalism and good governance to the institution. She is the first lady Chairperson of the CMS governing body.
What I say to these students is that you will face difficulties in your new journey in life. Dont be discouraged. Take it as a challenge. And move forward one step at a time, pointed out Speldewinde.
Chief Operating Officer IPS Sunimal Fernando, addressed the chief guest, calling his dedication and commitment to the LCIPS an inspiration.
We still recall the valuable advice you gave to us as Chairman of the Management Committee. It was you who initiated and guided us to take Ladies College, department of vocational studies to a higher level as Ladies College Institute of Professional Studies. Father Melvin, we wish to thank you for being a blessing to all of us. Madam Speldewinde thank you for the professional guidance and support you have given to us at all times in order to manage LCIPS efficiently, said Fernando.
He commented that for the past 37 years LCIPS has been successful in training many professionals in numerous fields. He also stated that they have produced teachers of high calibre. It has brought out the best in each student while opening up so many opportunities for all involved. He also thanked the Past principals, Vice Principals, Directors, Deputy directors and former members of the management committee who have worked tirelessly and brought LCIPS to this level.
Special needs education has perhaps become a necessity. It is widely accepted that many students have difficulties in learning and teachers should be able to identify these difficulties and include these students in the general classroom environment, said Fernando.
Fernando said that there is a huge demand for the courses offered here. He also said that students fit in perfectly and have been able to perform their duties well. There is very good feedback from organizations that employ these students. All this is due to the support of those involved in guiding these students.
Our staff are skilled at imparting knowledge to the students. We thank them for doing a wonderful job. The abilities of these students have really blossomed due to the aesthetic programs we offer which even include summer camps. We also involve the parents in what we do, explained Fernando.

First SAARC confab on NCDs held in Colombo
The first SAARC non-communicable diseases (NCDs) conference began at the Galle Face Hotel, Colombo, under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena on March 31.
The main objective of the conference was to share country-wise experiences of NCDs, to decide on common areas of interest with regard to controlling NCDs in the SAARC region and discuss and finalise the terms of reference for the SAARC annual meeting on NCDs.
The WHO has launched programmes in all countries to minimise NCDs caused by genetic factors and physical and environmental habits. People living in low and middle-income countries are largely subjected to NCDs like heart disease, cancer, respiratory problems, and diabetes, and it has been found that annually nearly 10 million deaths occur worldwide due to NCDs.
The main causes of NCDs are use of alcohol and tobacco, lack of exercise, and lack of a balanced diet. The WHO has also identified NCDs as a major obstacle towards the achievement of sustainable development goals.
As such, programmes have been launched worldwide to minimise NCDs by 2030.
The programme launched in Sri Lanka towards achieving this objective has been highly appreciated by the WHO which said it was a guideline for other countries.
Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Deputy Minister Fasial Cassim, Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa, Director of the SAARC Secretariat and other officials were also present on the occasion.
The two day conference ended yesterday.

Speaking at an event held at the Coconut Cultivation Board recently he said that people who are against the lifting of the ban should come up with an alternative for it.
He also said that people are blaming the government for the high price of coconut which was happen as a result of the drought. However as the Minister in charge of coconut I cannot blame the drought and wait. We have to invest in new technology and replanting especially in areas in North East.
Sri Lanka needs 3 billion coconuts per annum out of which 2.7 billion are consume in Sri Lanka.
The Minister said that in contrast to the tea industry where there is lot of innovation and exports, the coconut sector is yet to tap this potential. There is a growing global demand for coconut water based products and other byproducts and researchers as well as the private sector should look at these.
Minister Dissanayake also said that he is against the import of coconuts to cushion down the high prices of coconuts. We have allowed some part of imports and those are for the industrial sector.
He said that the prevailing drought is expected to clear by June and then the situation should ease.

Global bid to unravel the puzzle of the autistic child
Today, April 2, 2018, is the eleventh annual World Autism Awareness Day. Autism-friendly events and educational activities will take place all month to increase understanding and acceptance and foster worldwide support.
The day aims to focus on the hurdles that people with autism and others living with disorder face every day. As a growing global health concern owing to its increasing exposure in the media, autism spectrum disorder, ASD, is an issue that has been gaining more understanding than ever before.
Whats more, the world goes one step further to celebrate the unique talents of those with autism, while putting a huge focus on the warm embrace and welcome that these skills deserve through community events around the globe.
The events include special actions aimed at raising awareness and raising funds in unique ways. Even with these annual celebrations, many people around the world still do not understand all there is to know about this puzzling malady.
Autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning that there is a wide degree of variation in the way it affects people. Every child on the autism spectrum has unique abilities, symptoms, and challenges. Learning about the different autism spectrum disorders will help you better understand your own child, get a handle on what all the different autism terms mean, and make it easier to communicate with the doctors, teachers, and therapists helping your child.
It must be reiterated that autism is not a single disorder, but a spectrum of closely related disorders with a shared core of symptoms. Every individual on the autism spectrum has problems to some degree with social skills, empathy, communication, and flexible behaviour. But the level of disability and the combination of symptoms varies enormously from person to person. In fact, two kids with the same diagnosis may look very different when it comes to their behaviour and abilities.
If you are a parent dealing with a child on the autism spectrum, you may hear many different terms including high-functioning autism, atypical autism, autism spectrum disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder. These terms can be confusing, not only because there are so many, but because doctors, therapists, and other parents may use them in dissimilar ways.
Part of the reason it is so hard to separate mental illnesses from autism is that autism is still not fully understood and appears different in each person. One persons autism is nothing like another persons autism. What it means is that a programme, classroom, therapy or social group event that works beautifully for one autistic person may be an utter disaster for another person with the identical diagnosis.
But no matter what doctors, teachers, and other specialists call the autism spectrum disorder, its your childs unique needs that are truly important. No diagnostic label can tell you exactly what challenges your child will have.
Finding treatment that addresses your childs needs, rather than focusing on what to call the problem, is the most helpful thing you can do. You dont need a diagnosis to start getting help for your childs symptoms.
In both children and adults, the signs and symptoms of the autism spectrum disorders include problems with social skills, speech and language, and restricted activities and interests. However, there are enormous differences when it comes to the severity of the symptoms, their combinations, and the patterns of behaviour.
Keep in mind that just because your child has a few autism-like symptoms, it doesnt mean he or she has an autism spectrum disorder. The autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed based on the presence of multiple symptoms that disrupt your childs ability to communicate, form relationships, explore, play, and learn.
Whether its at school, work or in social settings, people with autism are often misconceived. They often suffer discrimination, intolerance and isolation, resulting in many feeling excluded from everyday society.
Various expert studies agree in accord and shatter the myth that autism is not, repeat not, a mental health disorder. Rather it is a neurological disorder. Studies of the people with autism have revealed abnormalities in brain structure and neurotransmitter levels. Part of the reason it is so hard to separate mental illnesses from autism is that autism is still not fully understood and looks different in each person.
Yet, how do we comfort the parents of such children who have been through the Autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. However well-intentioned comments that were meant to comfort can sometimes cut like a knife! Yet what do you say to parents carrying such a cross Even with the right to be wary you must never bring yourself to say the wrong things. No you dont blurt out that you are sorry! Because that sometimes makes things worse
You dont say youre sorry because these people dont want to be pitied. And it makes things worse not better. While for many of them the life after diagnosis will be different, it is not less. While their child might miss out on some things, he or she is not considered less. You dont say to these parents, Hell be fine. ASD is very complex and no two journeys are the same. One parent told me: Even as a mother of a child with autism I am very hesitant to give advice, as I know my sons autism is not your childs autism.
We should all know better than to say Really He seems so normal. Those phrases do not comfort, they simply insert an opinion when our opinion was not asked. Parents facing an ASD diagnosis do not want unsolicited advice or pity. They do not want you to minimize their feelings or give false hope.
They want you to listen. They want you to care. They want you to stay in their lives and not brand them as special needs parents. They want you to understand that although their lives might be taking a different turn, they still need friends. Their children still need friends and subtle support.
Then what the heck do you say to these people Sure as a counsellor I too was at a loss for words. Even as a professional wordsmith I could not find the right words. Then like a bolt from the blue it came to me. The two simple and perfect words you can say: Im here. And mean it. Mean it through every struggle, every victory and every passing day.
Mean it on the days when autism is all they can talk about and on the days when they need an extra set of hands. Mean it when you are making out the list of which children to invite to your childs birthday party. They dont need you to be an expert on autism. They dont need you to always say the right thing. Now, more than ever, they need you to just be there.

During the series, he has played some superlative strokes and has also taken some wonderful catches, the latest one being Usman Khawajas catch down the leg-side off Vernon Philander. Australian bowlers found it difficult to restrict the Proteas cricketer in the 4th Test.
However, above all the cricketing challenges he encounters every day, it eventually required a honeybee for de Kock to succumb. The painfully hilarious incident occurred during the closing stages of the second days play at the Wanderers in Johannesburg when the Aussies struggled to counter the venom spewed by the South African bowlers. He missed a stumping chance owing to a bite by the venomous honeybee.
Keshav Maharaj bowled a beautiful delivery, which was missed altogether by Shaun Marsh, who looked jittery throughout his knock.
However, de Kock completely missed the ball and the cherry went through his legs as he attempted to inflict the dismissal. Replays showed that he was stung by a bee just when was about to gather the ball and he screeched in pain thereafter, letting the ball go.
Nevertheless, Marsh couldnt make South Africa pay and soon became Maharajs victim, minutes before the curtains came down on the days play. Marsh took charge after the fall of the third wicket in the form of Peter Handscomb. Thereafter, he put his head down and defended everything, barring a few shots here and there, that was hurled at him by the Proteas bowlers. Eventually, it was a forward defensive stroke that led to his dismissal. - CT

Injury-stricken Paine hails battling Australia
Johannesburg:Australian captain Tim Paine praised the fight shown by his team after they had the better of the third day of the fourth Test at the Wanderers Stadium on Sunday, helped by his 62 despite batting with a broken thumb.
Australia are still in a desperate situation, with South Africa going into the fourth day leading by 401 runs with seven wickets in hand.
The Proteas, leading the series 2-1, need only to draw to beat Australia in a home series for the first time since 1969/70.
But the progress of the hosts was slowed by Australias fightback -- and an injury to Morne Morkel which could weaken South Africas bowling attack when Australia bat again.
Were a long way behind the game, theres no doubt that, but Im happy with the spirit and the fight with the bat and the discipline our bowlers showed, said Paine.
Appointed following the ball-tampering scandal which led to Steve Smith being banned, new captain Paine set the example in the morning.
Despite batting with a hairline fracture of his right thumb, he made a defiant half-century before being last man out.
From a seemingly hopeless overnight total of 110 for six, Australia added another 111 runs before being bowled out.
Paine sustained his thumb injury while keeping wicket on Saturday. Its okay, he said. Its got a little crack in it. It hurts a little bit but Ive had my fair share of finger injuries and compared to a couple of others its not too bad.
South Africa did not enforce the follow-on, with doubts about the ability of Morkel to bowl because of a side strain.
Australias bowlers then restricted the hosts to a run rate of 2.4 in the second innings as they laboured to 134 for three at the close.
We were very disappointed with the way things went yesterday (Saturday), said Paine, who revealed that the players had spoken about it after play and had resolved to respond positively.
We didnt get the wickets we perhaps deserved but I was really proud of the way the bowlers stuck at it, the same with our fielding group, said Paine. I thought our energy right through the innings was excellent.
- Cummins shows all-round ability -
Paine and Pat Cummins walked out to resume the Australian innings on a heavily overcast morning, with their team facing the humiliation of being bowled out quickly and forced to follow on.
But they stayed together for most of the morning, with Cummins making a Test-best 50 off 92 balls before he missed a sweep and was leg before wicket to left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj shortly before lunch.
Their seventh-wicket partnership was worth 99, the best for any wicket by Australia in the series.
We all know how good Pat is as an all-round cricketer, said Paine. This tour he has been superb, he was fantastic in the Ashes as well.
Morkel, playing in his last Test before retiring from international cricket, broke down as South Africa toiled in search of a breakthrough, leaving the field two balls into his fourth over of the day.
A South African team spokesman said the injury was in the same area that he damaged in a Test against Bangladesh in October, keeping him out of action for two months.
But after being strapped up, Morkel bowled a few gentle deliveries to coach Ottis Gibson during the lunch break and took the field with the rest of the team after the interval, giving hope that he may be able to bowl in the second innings, even if not at full pace.
Maharaj said he thought Morkel would be fit but acknowledged that he could have to bowl a large number of overs in the second innings to support fast men Vernon Philander and Kagiso Rabada.
Maharaj noted the bounce and turn achieved by Australian off-spinner Nathan Lyon, who beat the bat frequently on Sunday afternoon.
There will be a lot of emphasis on the spin but I actually think it is turning and bouncing too much to find an edge, he said. AFP

Joshua goes the distance before beating Parker in world heavyweight clash
CARDIFF, Saturday: Anthony Joshua was taken the distance for the first time in his professional career before winning a unanimous points decision in his world heavyweight title unification fight with Joseph Parker in Cardiff on Saturday.
After 12 rounds, Britains Joshua triumphed 118-110, 118-110, 119-109 on the three judges scorecards.
Victory extended the London 2012 Olympic champion perfect professional record to 21 wins from as many bouts but all of his previous successes had been by way of knockouts.
It also saw International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Association champion Joshua add Parkers World Boxing Organisation belt to his collection. This result was New Zealand boxer Parkers first defeat in his 25-fight pro career.
Saturdays contest in front of a 78,000 capacity crowd at the Principality Stadium was the first time two previously undefeated heavyweight champions had met for a world title in Britain.
Joshuas win should move him closer to a bout against Deontay Wilder, the American who holds the World Boxing Councils version of the heavyweight title.
Wilder had been due at ringside but didnt show and a confident Joshua, speaking to Sky Sports, after his win was confirmed, said: I want Wilder... Get him in the ring and Ill knock him spark out.
Joshua added: That is 21 professional fights with six world title fights in it.
My strategy was to stick behind the jab and that secured me another world title belt.
And he insisted he felt no disappointment in going 12 rounds.
I know the bookies say I might get a knockout but forget the hype, Parker was a world champion, Joshua said.
This was a boxing match, not a fight. Parker said this would be war, I said this would be boxing finesse.
With Joshua earning a reported 15 million ($21 million, 17 million euros) and Parker 7 million, this was easily the biggest fight of the beaten boxers career.
The way in which referee Giuseppe Quartarone refused to let any inside close-quarter work develop proved a frustration to both boxers and Parker said: We could have worked inside more, we cant change it.
Of course, Im young, fit and strong. Im fit to go 12 rounds, thanks to all the New Zealanders here and back home, he added.
He (Joshua) is a good big man and was better on the day. Well be back.
Shortly before the bout started, Parkers promoter, David Higgins, came to the press seats at ringside to allege Joshuas camp had tried to get his boxers hand wraps changed in a bid to unsettle his man, although he added the wraps eventually remained as they were once British Boxing Board of Control general secretary Robert Smith had been consulted.
Joshua had weighed in at 17st 4lbs (110.4kgs) on Friday, well down from a career high of 18st 2lbs (115.5) against Carlos Takam last time out, while Parker came in at 16st 12lbs (102.3).
As Parkers mother looked on from ringside, Joshua took charge.
A cut around Parkers left eye was evident from the third round.
Joshua tagged Parker with a solid left in the fourth and landed again seconds before the bell ended that round. But Parker made some good connections in the fifth and there was a furious exchange early in the sixth, before Quartarone intervened.
Joshua, having been struck late when the referee tried to break up the fight, incurred the wrath of Parkers trainer, Kevin Barry, when he too landed late in the eighth round.
Both boxers were hampered by Quartarones interventions just when it seemed either one of them might unload with a sequence of punches. The cut round Parkers left eye worsened and blood emerged from the wound in the tenth round.
But a game Parker kept going and the boos at the end of the contest appeared to be aimed at the referee rather than the boxers.  AFP

Kidney-kind remedies
Sri Lankas rural environment is no longer peaceful as college textbook fairytales used to suggest. A stranger has knocked at the impoverished farmers door with one more burden: Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown etiology or CKDu. Dr Rathnasiri A Hewage (MBBS, MSc (Med Admin) MACPE (USA) MCMA (SL), MD (Med Admin) DIPPCA. PH210x (Harvard), Dip in IT Management (Alison), MAPCR (USA), Dip in EU Public Procurement (Belgium) who is a Consultant in Medical Administration and CEO / Director of the National Institute For Nephrology Dialysis & Transplantation, Colombo, gets in touch with Health Watch to explore possible rescue from the disease of unknown etiology.
Q: What is the genesis of CKDu
A: The real timeline of the disease is unknown since most of the affected countries lack renal disease registries. The affected regions are mainly farmlands drowned in poverty. Nicaraguan health authorities, for instance, issue statements that they have been noting an increase of CKD cases in the Pacific Ocean coastal regions since the 1980s. But it was not until 2002 that a scientific paper from an El Salvadoran hospital first communicated and described the existence of an important group of CKDu patients with a particular epidemiological pattern.
Since the origin of the disease is still unidentified, or rather unknown, it is difficult to say the patients at the risk of developing CKDU and prevention methods.
Q: What are the identified symptoms of CKDu
The early symptoms can be listed as follows:
1. Loss of appetite.
2. General ill feeling and fatigue.
3. Headache.
4. Itching (pruritus) and dry skin.
5. Nausea.
6. Natural loss of weight without any attempt.
We have also identified late symptoms such
as the following:
1. Abnormally dark or light skin.
2. Bone pain.
3. Drowsiness.
4. Concentration or thinking concerns.
5. Numbness or swelling in the hands and feet.
6. Muscle twitching or cramps.
7. Breath odour.
8. Easy bruising, or blood in the stool.
9. Excessive thirst.
10. Frequent hiccups.
11. Problems with sexual function.
12. Menstrual periods stop (amenorrhea).
13. Shortness of breath.
14. Sleep problems.
15. Vomiting
Q: What is the possible remedy when you observe a portion of these symptoms in a patient
A: Such a patient should immediately see a doctor. The doctor will use a screening tool that is a package consisting of a combination of tests, testing for Serum Creatinine with calculating estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), measuring urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) on an early morning urine sample and measuring blood pressure.
Q: What is your advice to stay out of danger
A: Lifestyle change is the best policy. Adhere
to the following lifestyle changes:
1. Do not smoke.
2. Eat meals low in fat and cholesterol.
3. Get regular exercise. Talk to your doctor or nurse before starting to exercise.
4. Take drugs to lower your cholesterol, if needed.
5. Keep your blood sugar under control.
6. Avoid eating too much salt or potassium.

Locally refurbished train makes inaugural journey
A special train with nine fully repaired and refurbished compartments made its inaugural journey from Colombo Fort to Ragama on March 31.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe and several leading Ministerial and Railway Officials travelled on the train. It left Colombo Fort at 9 a.m. with a full complement of commuters on the route.
The nine compartments were repaired and refurbished under a project to repair and modernise 200 old and disabled 200 compartments launched by the Ministry in keeping with a government budget proposal to grant incentives to local industrialists and uplift them, a Transport Ministry release said.
The 200 compartments to be repaired and refurbished include 140 compartments imported in 1989 and 1992 and removed from use and 60 other compartments belonging to S08 type power sets imported in 1992 and set apart as derelict.
The exterior and interior of the compartments including seats, toilets and accessories were repaired by a local industrial firm named TANTRI, while bogies, brakes, automatic connections were repaired by the mechanical engineering factory of the Railway Department at Ratmalana.
Each compartment had cost nearly Rs. 1.4 to repair and refurbish compared to the expenditure of nearly Rs. 60 million involved in importing a single compartment.
The release said the Ministry and the Railway Department had to face criticism and brickbats from Railway unions when the project was launched to collaborate with the local private sector to upgrade the Railway.
The main accusation was that steps were being taken to privatise the railway. The new project had not only proved them wrong but also enabled the country to make a great saving which would have been otherwise spend on importing brand new compartments and wagons.

Malala visits region where she was shot
PAKISTAN: Malala Yousafzai visited the Swat valley yesterday for her first trip back to the once militant-infested Pakistani region where she was shot in the head by the Taliban more than five years ago, reports AFP.
I left Swat with my eyes closed and now I am back with my eyes open, she told AFP, referring to how she was airlifted out in a coma after the attack in 2012.
I am extremely delighted. My dream has come true. Peace has returned to Swat because of the invaluable sacrifices rendered by my brothers and sisters, she said at a school outside Mingora, the districts main town, where she was escorted by the Pakistani military.
The brief trip by the 20-year-old Nobel laureate is a highly symbolic moment for Pakistan, which regularly touts Swat as a success story in its long battle with extremism as it defends itself against accusations by the US and others that its northwest remains a safe haven for militancy. The visiton which she was accompanied by her father, mother, and two brotherswas kept tightly under wraps.
After flying by army helicopter from Islamabad, she met with friends and family before visiting the all-boys Swat Cadet College Guli Bagh, a military-run school some 15 kilometres (nine miles) outside Mingora.
There she lingered some 45 minutes, taking photographs, before travelling back to Islamabad. The entire visit is believed to have lasted just over two hours. - AFP

Man City close in on title, Man United and Liverpool win
LONDON, Saturday - Manchester City need just one more win to secure the Premier League title after a blistering first-half display secured a 3-1 win at Everton on Saturday.
Deliciously for City fans, the three points could be secured next Saturday at home against Manchester United although with that game sandwiched between the two legs of the Champions League quarter-final against Liverpool, manager Pep Guardiola was keen to play down the chances of a title celebration.
We have to focus on the Champions League, we have United in the middle but for the line-up we have to think about the Champions League, the Spaniard told reporters.
City took just four minutes to get in front with a superb volley from Leroy Sane after a fine cross from David Silva,
The game was put beyond Everton within 37 minutes with a Gabriel Jesus header and a Raheem Sterling finish making it 3-0.
Guardiolas side took their foot off the gas in the second half and Everton restored a little pride with a 63rd minute strike from Yannick Bolasie.
It has long been a matter of time before City formally clinch the title but next weeks opponents head into the derby in second place and with a win under their belt after beating Swansea City 2-0 at Old Trafford.
Romelu Lukaku reached 100 league goals by scoring in the first five minutes as United dominated a Swansea side who have been revitalised under manager Carlos Carvalhal.
Alexis Sanchez struck before the interval, the Chilean forwards second goal for United, and the hosts comfortably saw out the victory at Old Trafford.
We have 10 points more than last season but there is a club which is making it practically impossible to follow. In other leagues we would be fighting for the title, said United manager Jose Mourinho.
Liverpool came from behind to win at Palace in manager Juergen Klopps 100th league game in England and move five points ahead of fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur, who visit fifth-placed Chelsea on Sunday.
Mohamed Salah scored their late winner, his 37th of the season in all competitions, after the equaliser by Sadio Mane.
Palaces Serbian penalty expert Luka Milivojevic had converted his seventh spot-kick out of eight this season to put the home side in front early on.
His old club were left in good heart ahead of an exciting week, with a Champions League quarter-final first leg at home to Manchester City on Wednesday and the Merseyside derby at Everton three days later.
It is usual for us that we need to fight here, especially after a difficult start, but it makes it more special at the end, Klopp said. Palace, however, remained in trouble, only two points above the relegation zone.
It is a bit of a groundhog day playing against these top teams, their manager Roy Hodgson said after his side conceded a late winner again, just as they had to Manchester United and Tottenham in their previous two home games.
West Ham jumped above their London rivals with a comprehensive 3-0 home victory over a poor Southampton side, who were three goals down at halftime in manager Mark Hughess first league game in charge and stayed in the bottom three.
Marko Arnautovic, who fell out with Hughes after leaving Stoke City for West Ham in the close-season, scored two of the goals.
Manager David Moyes was delighted with his team and their fans after protests marred the last home game, a 3-0 defeat by Burnley.
The supporters were great, they have been great here bar a few. The players gave them something to shout about today, Moyes said.
Huddersfield Town remained in trouble, three points above relegation, after losing 1-0 at Newcastle United to a goal by Ayoze Perez.
Bottom club West Bromwich Albion, who have won only one league game out of 30 since beating Burnley in August, lost to the same opponents 2-1 at The Hawthorns.
Ashley Barnes, with a spectacular bicycle kick, and Chris Wood against his former club were the scorers before Salomon Rondon grabbed a late consolation for West Brom.
Brighton were beaten 2-0 by Leicester City in a dramatic finish after Glenn Murray had his penalty saved by Kasper Schmeichel and Leicesters Wilfred Ndidi was sent off.

Navy salvage WW II ship
The wreck of one of the famous ships of Her Majestys Naval Service - SS Sagaing, which sank at the Trincomalee harbour during the World War II, is refloated after 75 years' stay underwater by a team of divers of Sri Lanka Navy making a landmark turning point in Diving and Salvage.
The 138m-long Passenger cum Cargo Ship launched in December 24, 1924 was hit by Japanese carrier air craft bomber attacks whilst at anchorage in Trincomalee harbour on April 9, 1942 and subsequently abandoned due to escalating fire onboard. On August 24, 1943, the damaged ship had been sunken to be used as a pier for Naval Ships.
The Sri Lanka Navy resorted to refloat the wreck which was fully submerged 35 feet under the sea to make sea room for expanding berthing facilities in the harbour. Salvaging and removing the ship wreck was assigned to the Eastern Naval Command and it was undertaken by the Eastern Command Diving Unit headed by the Command Diving Officer (E), Captain (CDO) Krishantha Athukorala on September 11, 2017.
Then a comprehensive salvage plan made by CDO (E) was launched by a team of divers supervised by CPO (DIV) ALNSS Liyanage through patching up all damages and strengthening up deteriorated ships structural parts by erecting an artificial ship side in to the sunken wreck for dewatering ships internal volume to recover lost buoyancy.
After a series of dedicated endeavour made within five months, on March 22, the wreck started to ascent to the surface.

Pakistan skipper grateful as West Indies fly in for T20s
KARACHI, Saturday - Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed thanked the West Indies for touring the country, as the Caribbean side arrived in Karachi Saturday in the latest step towards the resumption of top-level cricket in the South Asian nation.
The West Indies will become only the third international team to play a bilateral series on Pakistani soil since a militant attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore in March 2009.
The 13-member team and staff arrived late Saturday in two groups and were ushered into a bullet proof bus to their hotel.
Some 1,000 policemen and paramilitary staff were deployed along their route to guard the team, which will fly out soon after the third match on Tuesday night.
International cricketers stopped playing in Pakistan after the 2009 assault, citing safety concerns, and the national team has had to play its home matches in the United Arab Emirates since.
There has been a trickle of internationals and high-profile matches in recent years, however, with an improvement in the security situation.
We should thank... the West Indies cricket board and their team for the tour, Pakistan skipper Ahmed said Saturday.
I hope it will be a successful tour and when they go back they will tell players from other countries to come to Pakistan.
Zimbabwe travelled to Lahore for five limited-overs matches in 2015 -- the first since the 2009 attack.
That was followed by the final of the Pakistan Super League T20 tournament last year -- also in Lahore -- which featured several international players, including former West Indies captain Darren Sammy.
Soon after, there was a series against a World XI and a match against Sri Lanka -- all T20s in Lahore.
The West Indies will play three T20s in as many days starting Sunday at National Stadium in Karachi -- Pakistans largest city. This is the Caribbean sides first tour of the country since 2006.
The venue is hosting international cricket for the first time in nine years. The PSL 2018 final was played at the National Stadium last Sunday, packed with 33,000 fans.
Ahmed was especially pleased with the return of cricket to his home city.
I am also very excited as I last played an international game here in 2008 against India, he said.
The credit goes to the whole nation and I hope they will see very good cricket.  AFP

Proud to have Youth Affairs Ministry: Sagala Ratnayake
I am proud to have Youth Affairs Minister because it was under Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has rendered a revolutionary service towards youth as the Youth Affairs Minister in the 1980 decade.
This has vested a great responsibility on my shoulders to chart a better future for children, Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said.
Minister Ratnayake was addressing youth participants attending the Yovun Pura Youth Camp in Nikaweratiya at its closing ceremony on March 31.
"I have assumed this pride and responsibility with honour and prepared to work with you in future," Ratnayake said. Ratnayake, who said the Yovun Pura programme was a concept of the Prime Minister, added that the Prime Minister was in his youth when he planned it after assuming the Youth Affairs Portfolio. Minister Ratnayake said he visited youth from all districts attending the camp and observed their activities. During the inspection tour, he requested youth attending the camp to forward their ideas and suggestions to him. Everywhere, the youth emphasised that the camp concept was never an outdated programme.
Ratnayake said that today's youth were enjoying the fruits and results of the Prime Minister's concept and vision, but the time had come for them to think anew. The matters discussed with youth attending the camp would be incorporated into future programmes, the Minister said. Ratnayake said youth comprised a radical sectors of society. "As a government it was their duty to steer that radicalism in youth towards the right direction. Radicalism in youth brought a wave to create a massive political change in January and August 2015.
"The time has come to put a full stop to family rule and provide equal opportunities for all. Irrespective of politics, they should create a new system ensuring future security to the youth, the Minister said.

Rising rurality
Our region is blessed with a healthy mix of rural and urban settings. The news though from the towns and cities captures much of public information, though not necessarily for positive reasons. Today we draw inspiration from a number of Indian villages.
Dharnai, Indias first solar powered village
Once struggling to get basic electricity, Dharnai its first village in India to completely run on solar power. Since the launch of Greenpeaces solar-powered 100 kilowatt micro-grid in 2014, quality electricity is being provided to more than 2,400 people living in this village in Jehanabad district.
Payvihir, Maharashtra
Odanthurai, Tamil Nadu.
An obscure village in the foothills of Melghat region of Amravati district in Maharashtra, Payvihir, has set an example for the country by consistently showing how communities and NGOs can work together to conserve the environment and ensure sustainable livelihood for people.
In 2014, Payvihir bagged the Biodiversity Award from the United Nations Development Programme for turning a barren, 182-hectare land under community forest right, into a forest. Recently, the village also came up with an out-of-the-box idea of selling organic sitafals (custard apples) and mangoes in Mumbai under their brand Naturals Melghat!
Hiware Bazaar, Maharashtra
Amid the desperate citizens looking for water in the drought-affected parts of Maharashtra stands a village that has not felt the need to call a single water tanker  in fact, it hasnt called for one since 1995. Facing a major water crisis each year because of the measly rainfall it gets, the village decided to shun water-intensive crops and opted for horticulture and dairy farming. Their consistent water conservation initiatives led to rising groundwater levels and the village started to prosper. Today, the village has 294 open wells, each brimming with water.
Odanthurai, Tamil Nadu
Odanthurai, a panchayat situated in Mettupalayamtaluk of Coimbatore district, has been a model village for the other villages for more than a decade.
The panchayat has not only been generating electricity for their own use, but also selling power to Tamil Nadu Electricity Board.
Odanthurai has begun efforts to develop a corpus of Rs 5 crore to install wind and solar energy farms. This project will enable free supply of electricity to over 8,000 residents.
Kokrebellur, Karnataka
Named after the Painted Storks, which are called Kokkare in Kannada, this small village (which is not a reserved bird sanctuary) has set an example of how birds and humans can co-exist in complete harmony. The villagers treat these birds as a part of their family and have also created a small area for wounded birds to rest. Birds are so friendly here that they even allow you to go very close to them.
Khonoma, Nagaland
Khonoma has come a long way to become Indias first green village. Home to a 700-year-old Angami settlement and perfectly terraced fields, this unique, self-sustaining village in Nagaland is a testament to the willpower of the tribal groups of Nagaland to protect and conserve their natural habitat. All hunting is banned in the village, which also practices its own ecofriendly version of jhum agriculture (instead of the traditional slash-and-burn method) that enriches the soil.
Punsari, Gujarat
Punsari village, barely 100 km from Ahmedabad, could be a textbook case of development. Closed-circuit cameras, water purifying plants, biogas plants, air-conditioned schools, Wi-Fi, biometric machines  the village has it all. And all of it was done in a matter of eight years, at a cost of Rs. 16 crore. The man behind the transformation is its young tech-savvy sarpanch  33-year-old Himanshu Patel  who proudly states that his village offers the amenities of a city but the spirit of a village.
Ramchandrapur, Telangana
The first village in Telangana region to win the Nirmal Puraskar in 2004-05, Ramchandrapur came into focus a decade ago when the villagers pledged to donate their eyes for the visually challenged. Among its many achievements, all the houses in the village have smokeless chullahs and toilets with tap-water facilities. It is the first village in the state to construct a sub-surface dyke on the nearby river and solve drinking water problems by constructing two over-head tanks in each house. The village does not have drainage system and all the water generated from each house is diverted to the gardens, which are planted by the villagers in each house.
Mawlynnong, Meghalaya
In the tiny hamlet of Mawlynnong, plastic is banned, spotless paths are lined with flowers, bamboo dustbins stand at every corner, volunteers sweep the streets at regular intervals and large signboards warn visitors against littering. Here, tidying up is a ritual that everyone  from tiny toddlers to toothless grannies  takes very seriously. Thanks to the tireless efforts of the village community, this small, 600-odd-person hamlet in Meghalaya is today renowned as the cleanest village in India and Asia.
Piplantri, Rajasthan
For the last several years, the Piplantri village panchayat has been saving girl children and increasing the green cover in and around it at the same time. Here, villagers plant 111 trees every time a girl is born and the community ensures these trees survive, attaining fruition as the girls grow up. They also set up a fixed deposit for the girls and make their parents sign an affidavit that ensures their education.
Over the last nine years, people here have managed to plant over a quarter million trees on the villages grazing commons. To prevent these trees from being infested with termite, the residents planted over 2.5 million aloe vera plants around them. Now, these trees, especially the aloe vera, are a source of livelihood for several residents.
Eraviperoor, Kerala
At a time when the country is abuzz with talks about Digital India, and how technology can be taken to the remotest corners of the country, the Eraviperoor gram panchayat in Pathanamthitta district of Kerala is leading way. It is the first gram panchayat in Kerala to have free Wi-Fi for the general public.
The village has also launched a free palliative care scheme for the poor and is the first panchayat in the state to get ISO-9001 certification for its Primary Health Centre. It has also been recognised as a Model Hi-tech Green Village, by the Horticulture Department, for its green initiatives.
Baghuvar, Madhya Pradesh
A small village in Madhya Pradesh, Baghuvar is the only village in India that has functioned without a sarpanch since independence, and that too efficiently. Every house in the village has its own lavatories and there is a common toilet complex that is used for social functions. The village has underground sewage lines as well as the highest number of biogas plants in the state.
The gas produced is used as cooking fuel and to light up the village. Thanks to its unique way of water conservation, this village also has enough water to survive drought-like conditions for years.

Shangri-Las Hambantota Golf Resort hosts globally celebrated golf architect
Shangri-Las Hambantota Golf Resort & Spa recently welcomed Rodney Wright, the globally celebrated golf architect who designed the 18-hole course. Wright visited the resort to share his expertise with the resort team, review the golf course and celebrate the accreditation of the course as it has recently been USGA (United States Golf Association) Course Rated and Slope Rated.
Rodney Wright is a firm believer in integrating the culture and environment of the surrounding area into a golf course. His goal is to design a course that people walk away from, but remember every hole. With more than 40 years of experience designing award winning golf courses worldwide, he takes pride in creating unique and memorable golf courses.
Rodney Wright commented: My inspiration in Hambantota came from the unique settings of this former coconut plantation which gave us the opportunity to create a sense of place on the golf course and work with the coconut plantation grid to create a golf course which has a unique and distinctive character. This is one of the most unique golf courses I have designed; it has a great variety of golf holes, it is a place that you can come to have a fun round of golf, and enjoy the day in scenic settings.
The beautifully-landscaped par-70 golf course at Shangri-Las Hambantota Golf Resort & Spa offers three zones, each with its own unique character.
The course development was approached from an eco-perspective, due to the resorts dedication to biodiversity and habitat protection. The structure has revitalised an abandoned sapphire mine, restored vegetation, re-introduced birdlife and uses Paspalum grass for its salt-tolerant turf, which is resilient in the tropical climate and allows for the highest standards of course conditioning.
The golf membership at Shangri-Las Hambantota Golf Resort & Spa provides all the amenities you would expect from a world-class golf club, with different categories of membership to suit golfers preferences and special benefits at the resort.
Hong Kong-based Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts currently operates over 100 hotels with a room inventory of over 41,000. Shangri-La hotels are five-star deluxe properties featuring extensive luxury facilities and services.

Shine a light on autism
On World Autism Awareness Day, let us reaffirm our commitment to promote the full participation of all people with autism, and ensure they have the necessary support to be able to exercise their rights and fundamental freedoms. UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres
The eleventh annual World Autism Awareness Day falls today. Internationally on this day, buildings, homes and communities around the world, display blue lights in recognition of people living with autism.
In Sri Lanka too, the historic town of Kandy will illuminate several of the landmark buildings and sites in support of people with autism.
World Autism Awareness Day (WAAD) aims to put a spotlight on the hurdles that people with autism face every day. As a growing global health issue owing to its increasing exposure in the press and common knowledge, autism is an issue that is gaining more understanding and attention even in Sri Lanka.
Research carried out in the US two years ago points out that around one in every 68 people globally, is autistic. In Sri Lanka statistics from 2004 indicated that one person in every 100 was autistic. However, it is uncertain if this study included the entire country. According to medical experts, there is no specific study that has been done in the country in terms of determining the number of persons with autism in Sri Lanka.
What is autism
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autism are both general terms used to describe complex disorders of brain development. In most instances, those affected by autism may display varying degrees of difficulty in social interaction and verbal and nonverbal communication, and may also sometimes display repetitive behaviours.
According to experts in the field, autism appears to affect a persons brain development at a very early stage. However, it is believed that generally the signs of autism begin to appear more prominently between the ages of two and three. In the early years, a child with autism may show signs of difficulty in communicating, both verbally and and non-verbally, but may repeat what is heard instead of expressing his or her feelings or emotions. People with autism have a tendency to repeat noises and phrases that they hear(echolalia). They may not be able to communicate effectively because they struggle to express their own thoughts. For example, someone with autismmight only be able to repeat a question rather than answer it.
People with ASD may exhibit unusual behaviour as a result of not being able to relate or respond to their surrounding environment. Some children and adults with autism may show signs of behavioural problems due to their heightened sensitivity to a sound or something they may have seen or felt.
Communication and interaction
For people with autism, interaction with others is a challenge. They are rather distant and shy away from direct physical contact or even direct eye contact. For someone with autism it is difficult to communicate not only verbally but also through facial and body language. They cannot express how they feel or what they need and also are unable to understand the needs of others, be it physical or emotional. People with autism also have trouble forming emotional relationships and they are unable to interpret others emotions or needs and at times appear distant and aloof. They prefer to keep to themselves and appear to live in their own little world. They may sometimes become stressed by merely being touched. This may also affect their ability to form sustainable relationships due to their difficulties with social and emotional responsiveness.
While some of the characteristics are common, in terms of language, each individual could have varying levels of communication abilities. Some could be fluent in language, while others could have varying levels of speech, and some could be completely non-verbal.
In most cases, people with autism may tend to repeat the same sentence over and over again and ask the same questions repeatedly and they may prefer to stick to a topic that interests them rather than a two-way conversation, making communication rather difficult.
In Sri Lanka, it is common for parents of a child with autism to feel isolated and desperate as even in modern times, acceptance that ones child is different is difficult for them. Sometimes even family members and society tend to think that these children, with sometimes destructive behaviour, have just been badly brought up.
Autism campaign in Kandy
Speaking to the Daily News, the Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist at Sirimavo Bandaranaike Childrens Hospital, Peradeniya, Dr. Rasitha Perera said as World Autism Day starts from April 2, the world over, significant buildings are lit up in blue in support of autism. However, this was not done in Sri Lanka previously, but for the first time in the country, we have taken the initiative to launch this programme in Kandy. Accordingly, we will light up the Bahirawa Kanda, Asgiriya Chaithya, the area around the Kandy Lake and Queens Hotel. We are going to shed a blue light on these places every evening from around 6 pm for around four hours to show the citys commitment and support for those with autism. We have also initiated a media campaign to educate people on autism. The main programme was held yesterday under the patronage of the Central Province Governor Niluka Ekanayake.
In treating autism, music has been proved to be an effective tool. However, it was not an area that was pursued in Sri Lanka as even autism was relatively ignored in the country in the past. According to Dr. Rasitha Perera, for the first time, even music therapy will be used at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Childrens Hospital for the treatment of children with autism.
As approximately one in 68 of the world population is found to have a form of autism, it is not something that we can outgrow. However, being diagnosed early means that there is a better chance for treatment.
One of the reasons that music is being used in autism therapy is that it can stimulate both hemispheres of the brain, rather than just one. A therapist uses a song or instrument to support cognitive activity, so that a person with autism can build self-awareness and improve relationships with others. Music encourages communicative behaviour and can encourage interaction with others, which is something that autistic children have great difficulty with.
In this regard, veteran musician Nalini Ranasinghe who has done many songs especially for children, will also join in to make this endeavour a success.
Further a book will also be launched, in Sinhala, which is a guideline to parents on how to handle and help children with autism. We have also commenced a poster campaign on how to detect autism. Usually the presenting age of autism is around four to five years and after a child enters school. However, the best time to detect the condition is before the child completes one year. Therefore, the poster campaign will indicate some of the red flag signs that can be used in detecting if a child is autistic, Dr. Fernando said.
Early intervention offers the best chances
According to Dr. Perera, early intervention can offer a child with autism the best chances of overcoming most of the severe implications. For instance, if a child seems to have not developed eye contact with the mother even by around six months, then this is an indicator that the child may be autistic. We dont intend to label the child, but in the event the child is autistic, detecting it early will give us the chance to stimulate the childs brain in order to get the best result.
He noted that if a child has delayed speech and lacks social skills, parents should not wait hoping that it will correct itself. They should get medical help. It is a developmental problem and we have to act then and there and we cannot buy time.
He also said that in Sri Lanka, we have to battle the ancient beliefs that male children take longer to speak or speech is delayed because the childs hair was cut too early. These are just mythical beliefs and now that we have the facilities available to help these children lead a normal life, parents should also address this issue early, if it is detected in their child.
Sharing the same sentiments as the previous doctor, the Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, Dr. Udena Attygalle said the earlier you intervene the greater the benefit. If you intervene when a child with autism is around two years, there is greater benefit than if you intervene at the age of 10.
He emphasised the importance of early intervention (its much more easier to make changes that last if we intervene early), noting that there are red flag signs that indicate that something might be wrong and that parents should be encouraged to see a clinician immediately so that the child can be subjected to early intervention measures, as findings indicate that treatment has to be both intensive and effective.
For many years the subject of autism was swept under the carpet and even doctors were reluctant to take on the issue. But according to Dr. Attygalle, awareness is much better in Sri Lanka now than before. Services are also slowly developing, both through public and private initiatives.
It is also found that boys are more prone to autism than girls. There are a number of theories that might explain why more men and boys rather than women and girls get an autism diagnosis. Among them, one of the most accepted theories is that, overall, men and boys tend to be more susceptible to organic damage than women and girls (Rimland, 1964), whether through hereditary disease, acquired infection, or other conditions. Since it is now almost universally accepted that there is an organic cause for autism, it is possible that boys are more likely to be autistic, according to autism.org.uk. Various studies, together with anecdotal evidence, have come up with menwomen ratios ranging from 2:1 to 16:1.
According to Dr. Attygalle, Autism is thought to be a neurodevelopmental disorder, so it is something to do with how your brain gets wired during development. The social interactions and communication aspects of the brain get developed in a different way, in simple terms. Hence, this is found to be more common in boys than girls.
However, as both doctors pointed out, early intervention is the only and best course of action in terms of dealing with autism and providing the best treatment.
Stem cell treatment
Meanwhile, Dr. Perera also noted that there have been claims that autism can be cured through stem cell treatment.
A study was done at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina and the goal was to see whether a transfusion of the childrens own umbilical cord blood containing rare stem cells could help treat their autism.
The results were positive it was said, with more than two-thirds of the children showing signs of improvement. Similarly, there are several Indian doctors who also claim to be able to cure autism through stem cell treatment.
However, sceptics say there are too many unanswered questions that need to be addressed before getting excited. Even Duke researchers acknowledge as much. The initial trial, published recentlyin the journal Stem Cells Translational Medicine, was a safety study, not a controlled, double-blind study with definitive proof of positive results.
Therefore, Dr. Perera warns that parents should be cautious when seeking such treatment as there is still no definite proof to suggest that this form of treatment is effective.
For now, the best available option is to detect the condition early in children and offer them the best chance they have at leading normal lives through therapy, both behavioural and occupational.

Smart Trends International Lanka partners with Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka
Smart Trends International Lanka entered into a strategic partnership with the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka to offer the UK awarding body, NCFEs globally recognized certified courses in Sri Lanka.
The MoU was signed in the presence of the Chandima Weerakkody, the Minister of Skills Development & Vocational Training Sri Lanka.
Eng. (Dr) Lionel Pinto, the Chairman of the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka and Dato Dr. Emmanuel Benson, the Group Chairman & CEO of Smart Trends International signed on behalf of their respective organizations. NCFE is a national awarding organization, passionate about designing, developing and certifying high quality, nationally recognized qualifications and awards. These qualifications contribute to the success of millions of learners at all levels, bringing them closer to fulfilling their personal goals. Last year alone, over 340,000 learners from over 2,000 colleges, schools and training organizations chose NCFE as the awarding organization to help them move their careers forward.
Dr. Emmanuel Benson, the Chairman & CEO of Smart Trends International Lanka said, It is a significant and memorable milestone for Smart Trends International Lanka to be given the honour to partner with the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka in this strategic partnership. Our first initiative will be to develop and design a scaffolding training course (Level 1-4) incorporating innovative learning solutions, taking into account current local manpower expertise and needs and aligned to industry requirements.
This will include a process, whereby Smart Trends International and NCFE will identify and train a master-trainer who will then conduct the train-the-trainers programme in Sri Lanka, with a con-current programme for independent assessors.
Furthermore, we are confident that these courses will allow Sri Lankans to up-skill and up-scale their vocational expertise, thereby allowing them to be highly employable not only within Sri Lanka but within the regional and global construction industry, where their expertise will be in much demand in the long run, added Dr. Benson.
Besides NCFE, specific training programmes will also be endorsed and certified by the Industrial Training Institute of Kuala Lumpur, the oldest vocational training institute in Malaysia, founded in 1964. Smart Trends International Lanka will build a dedicated custom-built Scaffolding Training facility and simulated training and test area with six purpose-built scaffolds. Besides the above, training facilities with class room and management offices will also be opened concurrently.
The Level-1 Scaffolding course will be spread over 10 days and offer insights into scaffolding; from duties and responsibilities to scaffolding materials used and types, practical theory and on-site training to safety issues and a 3-4-part assessment.
We are confident, that by working in close partnership with the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka, we will be able to offer a globally benchmarked qualification on scaffolding knowledge and practical skills that will prepare Sri Lankans who will be entering the building industry to erect scaffolding safely and according to specifications, said Dato Dr Benson.

Sri Lanka leading from centre: Aryasinha
Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to UN in Geneva, Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha said Sri Lanka makes its best contributions to the International Community (IC) when it leads from the centre rather than positioning itself in a manner either to be taken for granted, or to remain isolated.
The Ambassador, who relinquishes his tour of duty as Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva this week, made this observation in his farewell address to the Conference on Disarmament (CD), where last month under Sri Lanka's Presidency, the Conference unanimously adopted Decision CD/2119 setting up five subsidiary bodies to commence substantive work.
Addressing the High-Level Segment of the CD, UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres welcoming this Decision stated, I believe you are off to the best start in nearly two decades, and I look forward to building on this new momentum.
Recalling that for long years Sri Lanka had been an active player in the field of disarmament, Ambassador Aryasinha expressed satisfaction that Sri Lanka was once again able to make a meaningful contribution through CD/2119, during its recent Presidency. He said the decision "was a balance between flexibility and safeguards, and it offered a framework for a more focused and continued debate on all core issues on the CD agenda. I believe this has the potential of being an irreversible first step in getting the CD back to work, and in asserting its credibility as the single multilateral forum for negotiating disarmament treaties," he said.
He believed that the cardinal principles upheld in arriving at CD/2119; inclusiveness in consultations, transparency in engagement without a pre-conceived agenda, and allowing adequate time to deal with the genuine security concerns of all Member States, will undoubtedly help as we move through the next steps of operationalizing this decision and bringing the Conference back to negotiations". Noting that the CD's "rule of consensus has not been the reason for the CDs stalemate, but it is the lack of political will", and that "clearly the issue is not procedural, but political", Ambassador Aryasinha said countries would be better served " if we use the rule of consensus, as a tool for compromise, rather than as a veto".
Emphasizing the significance that following the adoption of CD/2119, delegations who had continued to show scepticism about the CD process in the past, had expressing their willingness to work constructively towards realization of the its goals in order to get the CD back to work, he cautioned that CD members must be conscious that unless this window of opportunity is seized on, the momentum could be lost.
Ambassador Aryasinha remarked, "eventuality, whether CD/2119 was a beginning or an aberration remains to be seen. But one thing is certain. The cost of standing in the way of the CD moving forward has become greater".

Stephens downs Ostapenko to win Miami Open
MIAMI, Saturday - Sloane Stephens held her nerve in an error-strewn WTA Miami Open final to beat Jelena Ostapenko 7-6 (7/5) 6-1 and lift the prestigious title for the first time here Saturday.
Florida native Stephens, who has now won all six finals she has competed in, had been determined to win the last tournament at Key Biscayne before it moves next year.
However a nervy final was not easy on the eye with both players appearing to be struggling to get to grips with the occasion.
There were eight breaks of serve in the first set alone -- that total eventually ended up at 12 -- with French Open champion Ostapenko hitting 48 unforced errors compared to US Open champion Stephens making 21 during the entire one hour and 32 minutes.
The triumph for the American, however, capped an impressive campaign which saw victories over grand slam winners Garbine Muguruza, Angelique Kerber, Victoria Azarenka before Ostapenko was also dispatched.
I knew I would have to run a lot of balls down, you have to accept she will hit great shots so I didnt worry about that too much, said a delighted Stephens, who will be named in the WTA top 10 for the first time when the new rankings are released on Monday.
There were pre-match jitters but once I won the first set, I was able to settle, she added. I have wanted to be in the top 10 for so long. Its very exciting.
Stephens endured a terrible slump after winning her first major but has responded superbly and this first Miami title has set up well for the clay challenges ahead.
She added: I remember when I found out I needed surgery last year after the Australian Open I was so down but ultimately it gave me a different perspective.
Even when I am down or people are doubting me, there are so many great opportunities out there I didnt worry.
It was the first time either player had made it to the final of a WTA Premier Mandatory event and Ostapenko, at just 20 years and 297 days, was the youngest finalist in Miami since Azarenka won here in 2009.
Ostapenko came into the encounter having not lost a set but the Latvians efforts were washed away in a sea of errors and an inability to puncture the Stephens defence.
Sometimes I was being too aggressive when I didnt have to but it was working at the beginning, admitted the world number five, after losing the fourth final of her career despite hitting 25 winners compared to her opponents paltry tally of just six.
A final feels different, there was more pressure and I was missing shots I was hitting earlier in the week, she said.
Now I can prepare for the clay but I have some time before going back to the French Open and to think about what it will be like to defend my title.
There were boos ringing around Crandon Park when tournament director James Blake told the crowd that he would see them next year at the Hard Rock Stadium.
Florida born Stephens loves Key Biscayne and added: I will miss it and I feel very fortunate to be the last winner here.
There are so many good things about the tournament - the Iguanas, there is a great pizza place too. Key Biscayne is a hidden gem but I am sure the new place will be great.  AFP

Tiangong-1: Defunct China space lab comes down over South Pacific

China's defunct Tiangong-1 space lab mostly broke up on re-entering the Earth's atmosphere above the South Pacific, Chinese and US reports say.
It re-entered the atmosphere around 00:15 GMT on Monday, China's Manned Space Engineering Office said.
Tiangong-1 was launched in 2011 to carry out docking and orbit experiments.
It was part of China's efforts to build a manned space station by 2022, but stopped working in March 2016.
What do we know about where it came down
The rather vague "above the South Pacific" is the line from space officials.
US specialists at the Joint Force Space Component Command said they had used orbit analysis technology to confirm Tiangong-1's re-entry.
Astronomer Jonathan McDowell, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, tweeted that it appeared to have come down north-west of Tahiti.
Experts had struggled to predict exactly where the lab would make its re-entry - and China's space agency wrongly suggested it would be off Sao Paulo, Brazil, shortly before the moment came.
The European Space Agency said in advance that Tiangong-1 would probably break up over water, which covers much of the Earth's surface.
It stressed that the chances of anyone being hit by debris from the module were "10 million times smaller than the yearly chance of being hit by lightning".
It's not clear how much of the debris reached the Earth's surface intact.
Why did the space lab fall like this
Ideally, the 10m (32ft)-long Tiangong module would have been taken out of orbit in a planned manner.
Traditionally, thrusters are fired on large vehicles to drive them towards a remote zone over the Southern Ocean. This option appears not to have been available after the loss of command links.
Thirteen space agencies,under the leadership of the European Space Agency, used radar and optical observations to follow Tiangong's path around the globe.
Tiangong means 'Heavenly Palace'
The module was launched in 2011 to practise rendezvous and docking
Two astronaut crews visited in Shenzhou capsules - in 2012 and 2013
They included China's first female astronauts Liu Yang and Wang Yaping
China plans a more permanent space station in the next decade
It has developed a heavy-lift rocket, Long March 5, for the purpose
Is this the biggest space hardware to fall out of the sky
Tiangong was certainly on the large size for uncontrolled re-entry objects, but it was far from being the biggest, historically:
The US space agency's Skylab was almost 80 tonnes in mass when it came back partially uncontrolled in 1979. Parts struck Western Australia but no-one on the ground was injured
Nasa's Columbia shuttle would also have to be classed as an uncontrolled re-entry. Its mass was more than 100 tonnes when it made its tragic return from orbit in 2003. Again, no-one on the ground was hit as debris scattered through the US states of Texas and Louisiana
Astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell believes Tiangong is only the 50th most massive object to come back uncontrolled.
China has launched a second lab, Tiangong-2, which continues to be operational. It was visited by a re-fuelling freighter, Tianzhou-1, just last year.
China's future permanent space station is expected to comprise a large core module and two smaller ancillary modules, and will be in service early in the next decade, the Asian nation says.
A new rocket, the Long March 5, was recently introduced to perform the heavy lifting that will be required to get the core module in orbit.

Uplifting the Northern economy
We focused on education in the North in these columns on Saturday, highlighting the Norths contribution to producing some of Sri Lankas eminent personalities over the years and how its education sector received a battering from the war. But there is another sector that suffered even more heavily as a result of the conflict  the Northern economy.
Fittingly, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, an ardent advocate of ethnic reconciliation, has just concluded a three-day visit to the North to assess the economic situation there. Incredibly, this is the first time that a Finance Minister has visited the North in his official capacity since 2009, when the war ended. As our sister newspaper The Sunday Observer reported yesterday, Minister Samaraweera was on a three day visit to the Northern Province to raise awareness about provisions made for rehabilitation and debt-relief in his 2018 budget presented last year.
The North is perhaps unique in that it has the highest number of female-led households in the country. This is, of course, a result of the protracted conflict which claimed the lives of thousands of youth on all sides. One can imagine the scale of this issue on noting that Puthukudiyirippu, which bore the brunt of the final stages of the war alone has more than 2,000 women headed households. Going by the Divisional Secretarys numbers, there are 2,045 female-headed households, 438 war widows, 156 orphans, 707 disabled and 957 rehabilitated youth there. Overall, there are more than 7,000 women headed households in the North. Now the challenge is to uplift these women-led households.
Indeed, the Minister has announced a series of measures to improve livelihoods and alleviate crushing indebtedness in vulnerable war affected communities in the region. The Minister asserted that the grant of a six month moratorium on loans and the launch of the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme in May 2018 will help usher in a new era for the North.
Accordingly, with the moratorium in effect, when a new loan is obtained, there is no need to pay interest or capital of the loan for a period of six months. In addition, the Enterprise Sri Lanka scheme will provide concessionary loans at a maximum rate of 6.75% per annum. Women who want to engage in businesses will be provided an additional 10% concession on interest. These measures will no doubt provide an impetus for Northern women to start more ventures that can uplift themselves as well as the local economy.
Womens groups have also appealed to the Minister to set up a state-owned garment factory to assist females in addition to the privately run factory that already employs around 2,500. In line with this demand, the authorities should invite more local and foreign investors including members of the Diaspora to set up investments in the North. Minister Samaraweera said the Governments new Inland Revenue Act which comes into effect today, will especially benefit those seeking to invest in the North. Tax concessions offered for potential investors to the Northern region will be almost doubled.
Even as the co-operative movement has declined in many other parts of the county, it has remained vibrant in the North with more than 36,000 members, of which 90 percent are women. This is an ideal conduit for loan disbursements and investments since Co-operative Rural Banks and the Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies can be found in every nook and corner of the North.
Developing the fisheries sector in the North should also be a priority for the Government. The Government has already taken many measures in this direction  for example, the Myliddy fishing harbour was vacated by the Navy and opened for fisheries activities last year after a gap of 27 years. But the biggest problem facing the fisheries sector in the North  poaching in Sri Lankan territorial waters by Indian and other fishing vessels  must be resolved as soon as possible. Otherwise our fishermen, many of whom still do not have motorized boats and trawlers, face the prospect of losing their rightful catch to more powerful foreign vessels.
More attention should be paid to developing tourism in the Northern Province which can also give a boost to the economy. Now that the locals fascination for war artifacts and remnants seems to have faded, we need to invite more foreigners to the North to appreciate its natural wonders and famous man-made cultural and religious structures. More publicity should be generated for Northern tourist attractions.
The airports and sea ports in the region should be developed further with an eye on passenger traffic as well as exports and faster local distribution of northern produce. The Government also intends to build a faster highway to Jaffna that will help the latter aim.
But it is essential to win the hearts and minds of the Northern public whilst undertaking a massive development drive. This is exactly what Minister Samaraweera has done by touring the North. Then only will they get a true sense of belonging in the Governments social and economic uplift programme.

US says travelers will have to turn over social media info

Under new rules proposed by the US State Department, Sri Lankans traveling to the US would have to disclose any social media identities they had used over the past five years.
The move would affect an estimated 14 million travelers from a majority of countries around the world, except for major US allies like Australia, Japan, and the UK, which have visa-free travel agreements.
Maintaining robust screening standards for visa applicants is a dynamic practice that must adapt to emerging threats, the US State Department said in a statement last week.
Applicants applying for non-immigrant visas to the US already have to supply certain details like contact information, travel history, names of family members, and previous addresses.
Collecting this additional information from visa applicants will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity, the State Department said.
The proposal lists about 20 social media platforms that travelers would have to disclose when applying for a visa. Many of them, like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube are popular in Sri Lanka.
Consular officers will use this additional information only to vet applicants for potential visa ineligibilities under existing US law, the U.S. Embassy in Colombo said through a spokesperson on Monday.
They said they would not ask for account passwords, or try to subvert existing privacy protocols.
The Embassy issued nearly 17,000 travel visas to Sri Lankans last year, according to State Department data.
The proposal still needs final approval from the US Office of Management and Budget, following a 60-day public comment period.

The victory of humanism
Joyce is one of those writers who are neither permitted to be without beliefs nor believed about their freedom from such encumbrances; and the title of Mr. Morses book seems at first to promise exegesis of a dubious kind. We have had more than one recent attempt to present Joyces work as the embodiment of orthodoxy, however inverted.
The obscurity of Finnegans Wake encourages the idea that behind it must lie a portentous message and provokes attempts to read a cosmology into it. Since one particular philosophy of history, Vicos, is used in it as a structural device, the confusion is easy. All this is a pity, inasmuch as it distracts from true criticism; and it is ultimately as false and as distorting as the opposite and rather more old-fashioned picture of Joyce the atheist presiding in gratified horror over a godless world, so torn by his own apostasy and consequent vision of futility and loathsomeness that his work is simply an expression of a Swiftian disgust.
Human material
Joyce was born in a country where Roman Catholicism is a fact like climate or history, so that it was forever part of his consciousness and his human material; and it seems to be sometimes forgotten that such material could not be dealt with at all without reference to it. Besides, he enjoyed theological discussion in the abstract and respected it as a way of thought; and he employed it gratefully, as he employed so much else, both as parody and as structure in his work.
He continued all his life to use, sometimes ironically, sometimes affectionately, sometimes satirically, the terminology of what had not only been his faith but is, after all, a very great structure of human thought.
Mr. Morse examines some of the many ways in which he did use it. He does this without bias but he is inclined, like many recent Joyce commentators, to indulge in flights of fancy, to build too much on too little; he is too dogmatic where the facts do not warrant dogmatism or where there are no facts at all: and he is too charyfor one who shows evidence of a brilliant critical facultyof criticism. He tells us that the scorn of literary criticism of another Joyce commentatorand good criticMrs. Glasheen has some what chastened his own practice of it; his book might have been better if the critic had chastened the commentator more often.
Some of the correspondences with Augustine, Loyola, Scotus Erigena, William of Ockham and the Old Testament on which Mr. Morse depends may arise simply from the fact that both Joyces work and that of the fathers and doctors from whom Mr. Morse quotes are deeply grounded in human nature. The difficulty is to say when Joyce is consciously using an idea or a definition of Augustines, say, as part of his structure, when he is doing it unconsciously because it was part of his mental furniture, when the apparent use is sheer coincidence, and when it is sheer fancy on Mr. Morses part. Thus, when Mr. Morse tells us:
Sinners burden
All sins, says Saint Augustine can be summed up under three heads: the lusts of the flesh, intellectual curiosity and pride. Almost everything Bloom does or enjoys is a sin. Almost everything Dedalus does or enjoys is a sin. In this however they are not alone: all Dubliners, knowingly or unknowingly, bear the Christians burden.
Those who sink under it into damnation, however, are not the Blooms or Dedaluss but the thoughtless ones, the Mulligans, Punch Costellos and Father John Conmees. All take it up at breakfast, the thoughtful and thoughtless alike, the comparatively free and the wholly bound: For by eating and drinking, says Saint Augustine. . .
And when he then goes on to favour us with a lengthy quotation from the saint on gluttony, we may be permitted to wonder which should get the credit: Joyce, Saint Augustine, or human nature. After all, it is pretty clear that the writer and the moralist were, whether they liked it or not, forced to cover much the same ground.
Again, when he proceeds to classify various sins committed in the course of the day according to classifications used for the benefit of the faithful in the medieval treatise, Agenbite of Inwit, we may think the credit should go to the author of the treatise for inventing a nomenclature which stands up to such an extensive modern test, rather than to Joyce for cleverly constructing his book round it. The more so since, as Mr. Morse does not seem to be aware, the phrase agenbite of inwit did not appear in the first version of Ulysses at all.
Refused refreshment
In the same chapter Mr. Morse builds a great deal on an incident in the cabmans shelter, where Stephen understandably (considering the night he has had) refuses any refreshment. Mr. Morse says:
As his intellectual independence dates from his refusal to enter the church, so his social independence dates from his refusal to enter the family. He rejects the inefficacious sacrament of the cabmans shelter (something in the shape of solid food. . . a bun or so it seemed and what was temporarily supposed to be coffee). . .
This incident Mr. Morse turns into the climax of the book:
Dedalus does have many social sins on his consciencealmost the whole catalogue of Agenbite of Inwitand he is absolved from them by refusing to take communion. That is the act of renunciation that purifies and frees the artist in him.

Vince, Stoneman fifties put England ahead
CHRISTCHURCH April 1: James Vince and Mark Stoneman posted half centuries to give England a healthy 231-run lead with seven wickets in hand at stumps on day three of the second Test against New Zealand in Christchurch on Sunday.
The pair put on 123 for the second wicket before both being dismissed in the final session as England reached 202 for three at close of play.
Vince made 76 and Stoneman a personal best 60 while Joe Root was not out 30 with Dawid Malan on 19.
New Zealand, who started the day at 192 for six, were all out for 278, allowing England to start their second innings 29 ahead.
Alastair Cook went early for 14, continuing a disappointing run for the opener in which he has totalled only 23 in four innings in New Zealand, and has been removed by Trent Boult each time.
But Vince and Stoneman put England's innings back on track, helped by a benign wicket which offered little assistance to the bowlers.
Stoneman, whose previous best was 56 in the third Test against Australia three months back, had an anxious moment on 35 when given out caught behind, but the decision was overturned on review.
On 48 he was dropped by Ross Taylor at first slip and he brought up his 50 with a nick off Tim Southee that sailed just past the outstretched arm of wicketkeeper BJ Watling to the boundary.
But on 60 his luck ran out when he tried beating the cordon once too often and another edge off Southee was pouched by a diving Watling.
Vince went in similar fashion when he nicked Boult to the sole slip Taylor who made no mistake with the second chance to fly his way.
Root and Malan carried England through until bad light stopped play three overs early and will face a further 14 overs on Monday before the new ball is due.
The New Zealand first innings survived nearly 20 overs at the start of the day.
Watling advanced his overnight 77 to 85 before he was beaten by a demanding delivery from Jimmy Anderson which swung in towards the pads then nipped away to remove the off-stump.
Ish Sodhi had a brief stay for one, and Tim Southee, who had shared a 48-run stand with Watling, reached 50 -- his fourth Test half century -- when he was bowled by Anderson.
Neil Wagner and Boult put on a rollicking 39 off 42 deliveries for the last wicket before Boult was out for 16, leaving Wagner unbeaten on 24. Stuart Broad finished with six for 54, the ninth-best return in his storied 115-Test career, while Anderson took four for 76. AFP

Voice of Heart
Sheron Nanayakkara is perhaps one of the only female Sri Lankan radio presenters to have the opportunity to present a morning show on a foreign radio channel. While many Sri Lankans are employed in Dubai as domestic maids and other trades, she has succeeded in taking the countrys reputation to a very high level, by having been selected to present the morning show on Dubai radio channel Heart 101.7 from Sunday to Thursday from 6 am to 10 am.
She does not sound like an announcer regardless of whether she is reading from a script or ad-libbing, she sounds like she is talking to you naturally, as if she was sitting right next to you having a conversation.
With a well-rounded intelligence she carries herself in a stately and unafraid manner. She is secure in knowing what she wants in her career and in being emotionally intelligent she has the ability to keep her eyes on the bigger picture turning obstacles into opportunities.
On-air media superstars are those with the natural ability to communicate. Being natural starts with sounding natural, not by trying to emulate someone you admire. For Sheron Nanayakkara announcing and radio was a lifelong dream that came true.
Having always dreamed of being a radio presenter, she got her opportunity to get into radio straight out of school. E FM was looking for presenters and I called them up and told them I was interested. I had two interviews with them and I was hired. I Joined E in 2004 and was with them until 2008, she told the Daily News.
Not being confined to radio, she joined Radio One, which ultimately became Prime Radio and started her TV career in 2010. She also presented the morning show on Prime TV, which was a part of ITN.
Her smile and bubbly nature makes everyone around her cheerful and being behind the microphone on radio or facing the camera on TV, for Sheron, it all came naturally.
Speaking to Daily News on how she chose her career path, she said, As a little girl I used to practise how to do interviews in front of my mirror. I always wanted to be on radio and television.
Being an adventurous and independent person, Sheron was never one to miss out on an opportunity. Having got the chance to move to Dubai, initially for a short stint, she jumped at the idea. Eventually she left Sri Lanka and decided to pursue her career options in Dubai. I left SL and moved to Dubai, and got into Real Estate, as my mom had her own real estate company when growing up. Negotiating and sales is in my blood. I was in real estate for four years and by the time I left for Sri Lanka, I was the Leasing Manager in a leading real estate company in Dubai and had a team of 11 to 15 agents working under me, she said.
Having met her life partner in Dubai, Sheron found all the more reason to continue her stay there.
I was privileged to get back into radio in Dubai last November. That too, is to do a morning show with two other presenters for a brand new station. My voice was one of the first voices to be ever heard on the station.
Its been an honour ever since, as I do represent my country, in a place where Sri Lankans are known to be domestic maids, she added.
Her fluency in handling the English language always raised questions as to whether Sheron was educated overseas. But according to her, Sri Lanka is where she had gained her education throughout her life. However, she loves to read during her spare time and is also an ardent cricket fan, who would never miss a game, if Sri Lanka is in it.
Im often asked which country I was raised in or where I moved to do my studies, and for me, it has always been Sri Lanka. And yes for me cricket is my first love and no matter where I live, I will always support my country and I am proud to call myself a Sri Lankan, she noted.
When asked if Sri Lankans living in Dubai contact her through her radio programme, she said, I do get loads of messages from the Sri Lankan community living in Dubai, as most know me from Sri Lanka. Its an over whelming feeling to be in a place where I can represent my country to a wider audience.
Sheron has also had several rare opportunities that most Sri Lankan presenters have not had. For instance, she has had the privilege of interviewing some of the top entertainment personalities.
In my short span here, I have interviewed Ricky Martin, the Singing Dentist, RedOne, and Brian McFadden from Westlife and Keith Duffy from Boyzone.
Having come this far in her chosen field, for Sheron her success is her own. She had to work her way up to reach her dreams. Speaking of her journey to where she is today, No one has helped me to get to where I am today, except my family especially my mom. Its all the hard work I put in from day one. I know its a clich to say  follow your dreams but thats exactly what I did, I had many setbacks, and mostly of people dragging me down, but I had my eyes on a dream and I knew I wouldnt stop until I live my dream. And this is it. I am living my dream.

Watery grave for four in Gin Ganga
Four females including three teenage girls, drowned last Saturday (31) at Gin Ganga near Nugagala Mawatha in the Hiniduma Police Division.
The deceased, a mother, her daughter, and two friends of the daughter, had gone to take a bath in the Gin Ganga when the tragedy struck around 2.30 p.m.
Minurika Shyamalee, a Grade 9 student of a reputed Girls School in Galle, sought permission from her father, who is a school principal, to invite several of her friends to her house for the long weekend. They were supposed to visit Kalvari Mountain for religious purposes, which is a popular local tourist attraction.
On the ill fated day, Minurika along with her family and friends visited Mount Kalvari and returned home around noon. Then her friends suggested that they take a bath in the Gin Ganga, which was a walking distance from her house.
Minurika again sought permission from her father to go to the river. Minurikas father went to inspect the commonly used bathing spot and checked the water level and finally decided to allow the teenagers to go for a bath accompanied by Minurikas mother. Minurikas father advised them not to go to the deep end, but stay closer to the river bank.
The overjoyed teenagers were bathing in the river when one girl went after the soap container which was drifting away into the deep waters. The girl who went after the soap container then suddenly disappeared in the water. Minurikas mother and two more students followed the victim into the deep water to rescue her, only to become victims themselves.
The victims include Liyanagamage Shyamalee Anoma,(39), Mapalagama Liyanage Minurika Shyaamalee,(14), Muthuhettigamage Ravindi Yasasmini,(14), and Madawala Withanage Kawisha Anjalee. The victims were residents of Hiniduma, Tangalle and Mapalagama. The bodies were kept at the Hiniduma hospital for the post mortem. Hiniduma Police is investigating.

In terms of volume Richard Pieris & Bukit Darah led foreign purchases while LOLC & Aitken Spence led foreign sales.
In terms of value Bukit Darah & Carsons led foreign purchases while LOLC & Aitken Spence led foreign sales.
Point of view
Equity markets received a boost this week as LOLC Holdings (Pvt) Ltd.s purchase of a 29.97% stake in its own subsidiary, Lanka Orix Leasing Company (LOLC Plc) pushed markets away from its 8-week low and to its highest weekly turnover in 6-years.
Weekly market turnover hit a 6 year high of Rs.19.4Bn (+432% W-o-W) as LOLC Holdings purchased a 29.97% stake in LOLC Plc from ORIX Corporation of Japan for a value of Rs.12.8Bn.
The transaction, which helped push turnover levels to 6-year highs, is the highest since Mar2012 when Khazanah Nasional bought an 8.85% stake in JKH for 14.5Bn, and surpasses both Singaporean company Group Lease Holdings Rs.10.9Bn acquisition of 29.99% stake in Commercial Credit & Finance Plc in December 2016, and Hayleys Rs.10.5Bn acquisition of Singer Sri Lanka in Sep2017.
Although the transaction led to a net foreign outflow of Rs.9.9Bn and dragged the YTD net outflow on the CSE to Rs.2.5Bn (cf. YTD net inflow Rs.7.4Bn on 23rd March), the activity in the market helped the ASPI post a slight recovery after 4 consecutive weeks of W-o-W declines.
The broad-share price Index consequently gained ~33 points (+0.51% W-o-W) despite hitting an eight week low of 6440.2 on Wednesday.
The Indexs ~37 point gain on Thursday (following the LOLC transaction) helped the ASPI end on positive note (on a W-o-W basis) for first time since the rise of communal tensions in early-March.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from the results of the upcoming no-faith motion against PM due mid next week and the CBSLs 2nd monetary policy meeting for the year.
LKR records highestappreciation for 2018 YTD
The CBSL this week called for proposals to raise upto $1Bn, adding that the Foreign Currency Term Financing Facility (FTFF) could be denominated in USD, Yen or Euro or any combination of these currencies.
The FTFF is aimed at helping finance the countrys bunched up external debt repayments beyond 2019 which are estimated at $3.6Bn per annum between 2019/20224.
The CBSL added that rates on the 3 year maturity FTFF could be fixed or floating at a USD, JPY or Euro 6 Month LIBOR.
The LKR meanwhile appreciated against the USD for the 1st time in 3-weeks as exporter dollar sales and inward remittances outweighed seasonal importer demand for the US currency.
Worker remittances are typically higher during the traditional new year period while this years seasonal importer demand has reduced somewhat providing greater support for the LKR.
The LKR consequently strengthened 0.3% W-o-W against the USD following 3-consecutive weeks of weekly depreciation in the range of 0.1-0.3%.
The LKR appreciation this week was the highest appreciation again the USD so far this year, as the previous instances of LKR appreciation ranged between 0.07% W-o-W (in late-Jan) and 0.1% W-o-W (in early march).
The LKR has lost ~1.5% of its value against the USD so far this year in line with the LKR depreciation in the comparable period last year (1.4% in Jan-Mar17) but notably higher than the depreciation of 0.4% in Jan-Mar16.
With the approach of the traditional New Year in mid-April, currency dealers expect the LKR to remain under pressure on the back of continued importer demand for dollars.

Why birds sing in the morning 
A certain generation will remember singing in school assembly the hymn Morning has broken with the lyrics blackbird has spoken like the first bird.
But why do birds sing in the morning
Songbirds account for nearly half the worlds 9,600 bird species and while their patterns of singing vary, it generally takes place in the morning starting at around 4am.
Biologists think this may be because they are settled in their territory and are letting others know their whereabouts. Some ornithologists think that birds like to sing in the morning because the sound carries further because there is less noise around and the air is denser at that time.
The dawn chorus tends to dip during the mating season because the birds are too busy.
The first birds to start their singing are usually blackbirds, robins and wrens and it is the males that sing from the tree branches while skylarks sing from the air. Metro

Why cities are teeming with exotic wildlife more than ever
Its 463 pages of Danish Gothic script. Furthermore, its a mediocre scan on Google Books that Im trying to access through the shoddy wifi in the intercity train from Leiden to Groningen. Those are my main excuses for failing to find the first-ever reference to urban plants. According to Herbert Sukopp, the Berlin-based patriarch of European urban ecology, buried in Joakim Schouws 1823 tome Grundtraek til en almindelig Plantegeographie (Foundations to a General Geography of Plants) should be the very first mention of urban plants.
I will just take Sukopps word for it that Schouw, somewhere in this impenetrable text, writes, with inter-letter spaces for extra emphasis: Plants that occur near cities and towns are called Plantae Urbanae; for example Onopordon Acanthium [cotton thistle], Xanthium strumarium [common cocklebur]. In most cases, an alien origin is the cause by which these plants are found only in the vicinity of cities and towns.
Exotic species
Its interesting that two centuries ago, botanists were already recognizing how exotic species form an important contribution to urban biodiversity. In those days, the major avenues that today are bringing exotic plant species into cities did not yet exist: there were no garden centers, scattered bird seed, or globalized agricultural produce.
And the pet trade, as well as the planes, trains, and automobiles on which far-flung fauna nowadays hitch accidental rides, were also not yet as commonplace as they are now. With these activities bringing so many exotic species into cities, it is no surprise that nowadays, much more strongly than in Schouws time, urban biodiversity is an eclectic mix of species from all over the world.
In European and North American cities, the wild flora consists of 35 to 40 percent exotic species. And in the city center of Beijing, this figure even is 53 percent. Sometimes, the role that socio-economic factors play in these patterns is all too apparent. In Phoenix, Arizona, botanists measured the plant diversity in more than 200 plots, each 30 by 30 yards, strewn randomly across the city and its surroundings. They discovered that one of the factors most strongly determining how many types of plant they would find in a plot was the affluence of the local neighborhood. The better-off the residents, the greater the diversity of plants. This effect (which they called the luxury effect) is a clear sign that travel and trade, and the relentless escapism of exotic plants from well-tended gardens, are responsible for the botanical enrichment of urban centers.
Naturalists encountered
These constantly arriving foreign inhabitants form the first of at least four explanations for the high biodiversity urban naturalists are encountering in their cities. A second explanation is the fact that the places where people like to build their settlements, which then grow into cities, are often biologically rich areas to begin with.
If you open an atlas and look where the worlds biggest cities are, youll notice that they are not on mountain plateaus, deserts or other biologically poor regions. Instead, they are in the exact same places where we find biodiversity hotspots: estuaries, flood plains, fertile low-lying areas, and other places where humans and wildlife alike find plenty of food and many different niches are available. In other words, the second reason for the rich biodiversity of a city is that it was already rich before the city was built. Some of this richness will have clung on in the remaining patches of habitat, embedded in the city as it develops.
With a little poetic license, you could say that weeds, prosecuted and outlawed in the country, had taken up refuge inside the city walls.
A third source of urban biological richness is, in fact, the loss of good-quality habitat immediately outside the city perimeter. These days, many urban centers are ecological oases compared with the surrounding countryside. - Lit Hub

Youth to Sri Pada end in cop shed
Several youth on pilgrimage to Sri Pada carrying heroin and cannabis were arrested by the Hatton Police at dawn yesterday.
Hatton police said that sniffer dogs helped in these detections. Police were also able to detect cigarettes smuggled to Sri Lanka in their possession. The suspect youth are residents in Kegalle, Matale, Galle, Matara, Kalutara, Panadura and Avissawella and are in the age groups of 18 to 30. The suspect group of youth will be produced before the Hatton Magistrate's Court by police. Hatton Division SP Ravindra Ambeypitiya said six hundred pilgrims visiting Sri Pada with drugs and cannabis were arrested by police during the last three months.
They were fined by the Magistrate's court.
