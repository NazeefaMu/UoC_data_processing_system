Jeep drivers create unfortunate situation in Yala
Hotelier and wild life conservationist Srilal Miththapala says that due to the irresponsible behavior of visitors and errant jeep drivers to the Yala National Park, an unfortunate situation is being created.
The deteriorating situation at Yala is reaching unbelievable levels, with the Department of Wild Life Conservation (DWC) being unable and powerless to bring to book those who are a law unto themselves.
The only way to get some action is to bring enormous pressure and public opinion against the 'higher ups'," he said.
We have ruined the poor elephant called Gemunu at Yala by allowing jeep drivers to entice him with food, and very soon there will be disaster, and the elephant will be blamed. Now safari operators are encouraging the bears also and feeding them.
He said that in most cases the registration number plate of the offenders is clearly visible and the authorities should follow up on social media and take action against these persons.
He said that on several occasions he has personally brought this up with authorities to no avail. We have spoken to the DWC but they are afraid to act, he said.

Lankas real estate sector on upward trend
Sri Lankas real estate sector is now on an upward trend and currently over 3,700 luxury apartment rooms are being built and would be completed within next two years. Over 700 were opened during the last one and half years, said Sunil Subramanian, Director, JLL Lanka (Pvt) Ltd.
Real estate is set to play major role in Sri Lankans growth and a double-digit growth in the domestic real estate sector over the medium term is expected, he said.
Speaking while launching JLLs annual Sri Lanka real estate report titled Sri Lanka  Land of Real Estate Opportunities, he said that they observe an increased demand for residential property from wealthy and middle classes.
Colombo citys office market comprises nearly 1 million square feet of Grade A stock at 95% occupancy and we see that more quality office spaces are needed, he said.
The One Belt One Road initiative launched by China and the fact that Sri Lanka is one of the central points of that would see more Chinese buying properties in Colombo while there is also keen interest among Indians to buy property in Sri Lanka.
The proposed Port City Project and the Financial Centre along with the Megapolis Project and rapid development of infrastructure too are major plus points to market Sri Lanka as a preferred destinations for investments for apartments.
We believe that the overall outlook for the Sri Lankan real estate sector is strong and we expect this growth to be driven by the surging demand for residential and retail spaces over the coming years, he said.
However there are challenges that need to be addressed, of course. Sri Lanka is prone to limited but notable downside risks, largely arising out of the currently subdued levels of foreign direct investment and a high fiscal deficit. High electricity tariffs, traffic, lack of quality labour, and escalating construction costs are major concerns.
Steven Mayes, Managing Director, JLL Lanka (Pvt) Ltd., said that Sri Lanka is also making a name as a preferred tourist destination.
However Sri Lanka must attract high-end travellers and this is not happening now.
Up to now over 95% of buyers are from Sri Lanka and 65% of are Sri Lankan expatriates.
This marks a significant milestone for the domestic market, which we believe holds the potential to become one of the South Asian regions most promising success stories. Government should further relax land ownership laws for foreigners enticing them to buy apartments in Sri Lanka. 
He also said that the standards of construction in Sri Lanka are high and is in par with the rest of the world.
The report further notes that Sri Lanka continues to outperform neighboring markets in terms of the ease of approvals required to obtain building permits and register real estate projects.
This is indicative of an ongoing concerted effort towards improving the countrys platform to begin truly competing on the international stage.
Notably, the report features Sri Lankas debut onto the JLL Global Real Estate Transparency Index at a rank of 69 out of 109 international markets.

MR repeating lies in different ways
Mahinda Rajapaksa and his advisors, instead of working to take our country to the heights that our country could have achieved soon after the conclusion of the conflict in 2009, chose to run our country to the ground, stated Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
He was responding to a recent statement made by Mahinda Rajapaksa, MP for Kurunegala District on GSP + concession.
Minister Samaraweera stated: He made our country heavily indebted on the one hand, having borrowed at exorbitantly high, commercial rates; while taking decisions that made Sri Lanka withdraw from the international stage, on the other, thus making our country and our people isolated and shunned by the world. He hides the fact that time after time, major donor countries voted against Sri Lanka at the time, in international financial institutions.
Having eventually lost an election which he himself called for, ahead of time, he appears to still not be able to come to terms with that loss. His hunger for power makes him and his advisors continue to indulge in the lies, tricks and games that were so much a part of his regime and so much a part of his personality. Just recently we saw how he lied to the people about his travel to Japan. He said that he was travelling to Japan at the invitation of the Emperor of Japan! The Embassy of Japan responded to a question from a journalist denying this. Why resort to this kind of lying to hoodwink the people, Mr. Rajapaksa If you are in fact a follower of the teachings of Gautama Buddha as you try to show the people, isnt it about time, at least at this stage of your life, to try to abide by even one of the five precepts, and refrain from indulging in lies.
Mr. Rajapaksa, in a statement titled Government should not create unrealistic expectations about GSP Plus says that obtaining the GSP Plus facility is trivial, since Sri Lanka is very close to passing the threshold of an upper middle income country. He conveniently hides a fundamental issue. A country has to be classified as "upper middle income" by the World Bank for three consecutive years in order to be no longer eligible for the GSP Plus. Even if Sri Lanka were to reach that threshold tomorrow, we would still have access to the advantages of GSP Plus for three years, and for one additional year after the decision is taken to withdraw the benefit. This shows that Mr. Rajapaksa is clearly trying to distort facts because he cant acknowledge the fact that the National Unity Government has in fact managed to obtain a formidable boost to Sri Lankas economy, in application of Article 4(1) of the GSP Regulation of 2012, for at least four years.
This period of, at the very least four years, comes just when the European economy starts to show signals of growth recovery. With less unemployment and more consumer demand, this is the moment to join in enhanced partnershipwith the European Union!
But let me add a point. Mr. Rajapaksas reasoning that we shouldn't aspire to a better deal, because some time in the future the economy will grow is callous and insensitive to the workers of our country and their families. It reflects a complete lack of concern for our workers who expect progress in the immediate present, and they deserve progress in the immediate present. So what if Sri Lanka, thanks to the ingenuity and hard work of its entrepreneurs and workers looks poised to cross a certain threshold of average income Does it mean that we, as a government, should sit on our hands without giving them the opportunity for a better deal that they deserve now in the present Shouldn't we help them to reach our national goals sooner rather than later
The idea that GSP Plus puts Sri Lanka "under the supervision" of the EU is simply absurd. By committing to a number of universal human rights principles, we do nothing that was not already recommended by Sri Lankan people who came before the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) to give their input and views. Protecting every citizen from torture is not an alien imposition. It is a sovereign decision from a humanistic nation, towards its own citizens, inspired by the most sacred human values and principles. How ironic that Mr. Rajapaksa who claims to be not just a follower but a guardian of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, does not advocate granting the very basic human rights principles and rights and freedoms to the citizens of this country! Dont our citizens deserve the highest standards of protection Dont our citizens deserve the highest standards of human rights and freedoms
It was incompetence and arrogance of Mr. Rajapaksa and his advisors, and their determination to deny the people of this country their rightsthat resulted in Mr. Rajapaksa failing to retain the GSP Plus facility. It was ill-advised to not implement the 2011 recommendations of the LLRC, a Commission which he himself appointed, to protect citizens from torture, criminalize disappearances, and fully investigate cases of human rights violations. In fact it was an injustice caused to the law abiding soldiers of this country as well. Having failed himself, and the people of our country, now in 2017, it is simply invidious to criticize a successful measure that the Government seeks to implement for the benefit of the people of our country.
We know very well how Mr. Rajapaksa and his advisors tried until the last minute to retain the GSP Plus facility in 2010, and lost. Licking their wounds, they then sought to lie to the people by saying that he decided to not pursue the facility, to avoid damage to the countrys political, legal and institutional framework. He probably still cant get over those lies. So he keeps repeating them in different formulations and words even seven years later in 2017.
For this government, the GSP Plus system is a partnership that helps our nation and our people regain their due place once again on the international stage as a respected nation and a respected people standing shoulder to shoulder with the international community, shedding the pariah tatters that the former government chose to put on our nation and our people. Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan people deserve the best in the world. Sri Lanka is a proud nation and the Sri Lankan people are a proud people with the self-confidence to speak and act as equals with every country or group of countries in the world. We don't need to hide from global dialogue in order to feel better. On the contrary, we feel stronger when our laws reflect the best of global humanism, when our citizens benefit from the best law enforcement, when our workers and entrepreneurs see the ports of the world open to the fruit of their efforts.

SriLankan reduces losses
Contrary to inaccurate reports in the press, the management of SriLankan Airlines would like to point our that since the Unity government was formed, the airlines losses have been dramatically reduced. The table below clearly shows this: LKR 91.8 Billion in losses between 2001 and 2015 reduced to a fraction of this colossal number by 2017.
The fuel price reduction of 2015 saw a drop in ticket prices that did not recover when fuel increased again. The effect of this, coupled with the acceptance of several new (and expensive) aircraft, a depreciation of the LKR and other currencies against the USD (the majority of airline costs are in USD) saw a weakening of the balance sheet in 2016.
The airline continues to pay a heavy price for the extremely high lease rental agreements entered into by the previous Board. The cost of terminating the leases on four A350-900 aircraft that were grossly overpriced and completely unsuitable for the national carrier, imposed a further burden on the airline. (One off items below).
The airline is now undergoing a modest recovery in revenues and about to launch significant regional expansion. There new destinations in India, direct flights to Hong Kong and Guangzhou and a long awaited non stop service to Australia are all planned in the coming months. Further restructuring is required in order to reduce the cost base and make the company competitive in this extremely challenging market.
The Directors and management team are confident that with the support of the shareholder, the recovery of the national airline will continue and the positive trend will be further improved upon.

Abuse of vehicle tax benefits by MPs; writ petition dismissed by SC
A writ petition filed by a public interests litigation activist seeking a Mandamus Order directing the Bribery Commission to initiate a credible and independent investigation into the abuse of the Tax-free permit scheme by 85 of Government and Opposition Parliamentarians was today dismissed by Supreme Court on the ground that there is no basis to proceed with the petition.
The petition had been filed by Attorney-at-law Nagananda Kodituwakku naming the Commission to Investigate Allegation of Bribery or Corruption Commission, which has failed to perform their statutory duty on the plausible complaint made on corruption against members of Parliament and the cabinet of Ministers who have patently abused the public office to defraud the governments tax-revenue for unjust enrichment.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne with State Counsel Suren Gnanaraj appearing for the Bribery Commission informed court that the Bribery Commission has initiated an investigation into the incident. He said there is no necessity to proceed with the petition since Bribery Commission has already iniciated an investigation into the complaint.
Supreme Court bench comprised Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Upaly Abeyratne and Justice Anil Goonaratne.
The petitioner maintained that selling of permits and defrauding government revenue in this fraud falls within the definition of the offence of corruption under section 70 of the Bribery Act.
The petitioner is seeking a writ in the nature of a writ of Mandamus compelling Bribery Commission to initiate a credible and independent investigation into the plausible complaint made by the petitioner under section 4 of the CIABOC Act No 19 of 1994 against the abuse of the Tax-free permit scheme for improper purpose of unjust enrichment by those who hold public office as MPs and members of the cabinet of Ministers in the government of the republic of Sri Lanka.
The petitioner stated that in the process of a study conducted into the abuse of tax-free permitsoffered to MPs, he discovered that the government had been incurring a colossal loss of revenue under the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa regime and a formal complaint was made on December 11, 2014 to the Bribery Commission to initiate an investigation into the matter forthwith. These losses amounting to over 40 billion rupees a year were evidenced in the content of the first fiscal policy statement made in Parliament on November 20, 2015 by the Finance Minister.
The Finance Minister on May 2, 2016 issuing the Gazette Notification No 1965/2 under section 3C of the Excise (Special Provisions Act No 13 of 1989, empowering the Secretary to the Ministry of Parliamentary reforms to grant total tax exemption to MPs for importation of motor vehicles (up to the value of US$ 62,500 per each vehicle) with no engine capacity or fuel type specified, the petitioner added.
The Finance Ministers deliberate action has paved the way for the loss of government revenue of over 7 billion rupees and set at December 9, 2016, 85 expensive vehicles have been imported evading the tax component of over 33 million rupees for eachvehicle.
Most of the vehicles imported by those who have purchased the permits have been registered with the Department of Motor Traffic first in the name of the permit holder MP and then immediately afterwards transferred in the name of the buyers of the permits.
If not for MP tax-permits every individuals who has imported these expensive vehicles should have paid fiscal levies at the rate of 300% of the transaction value, the petitioner further added.
The eighty five MPs who had been named as respondents for allegedly evading the tax component of over 33 million rupees for each vehicles were; Udaya Gammanpila, Sujeewa Senasinghe, Shehan Semasinghe, Ramesh Pathirana, Kanchana Wijesekara, Annamalai Sivasakthi, Nimal Lansa, Pavithra Wanniarachchi, Priyantha Asoka, D.

All must work together to reap benefits of GSP plus:Vijith Vijayamuni
All should co-operate, negotiate and work together despite their party politics to reap the maximum benefits from the GSP plus facility to the Sri Lankan economy and save this country from the debt trap, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa said.
"This facility will lead to more investors coming back to Sri Lanka to invest and enjoy GSP benefits when they re-export. We will be able to take full advantage of GSP Plus if many factories are set up near ports and the airports throughout the country. We need to generate over
100,000 new jobs and 500,000 associated jobs while adopting new technology for industries. Since Sri Lanka is currently with a very unfavourable balance of payment, regaining of GSP plus
facility would vastly help in reducing deficit in balance of payments," he said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo, the Minister said the opposition knows that many problems including unemployment and high inflation will be solved with the industrial revival of the country. "That is why, several protests were launched by the Opposition against the government's move to set up a Special Industrial Park near the Hambantota port. We urge the opposition members to extend their fullest support to take this country forward with the aim of
overcoming the debt burden."
"Today the Joint Opposition members are having dreams of our two parties splitting up. They think we are having several problems with regard to the Cabinet reshuffle and these problems will eventually lead to a split within the unity government. They imagine there are issues between the President and Prime Minister and the SLFP and UNP. But, there is nothing like that and we are moving forward in a very strong manner than before. However, we have proved that this unity
government is not weak and that we can overcome any obstacle. We are stable and we will definitely not fall apart. We will leave the government only after creating a strong state with a stable economy, society and politics," added Zoysa.
Sri Lanka received a number of economic and development benefits through the official visits of President Maithripala Sirisena to many countries in the recent past. The President visited Australia, India, Pakistan and China which has resulted in the commencement of new chapters in bilateral relations between those countries. The people of Sri Lanka will be benefited by the results of the successful discussions he had with leaders of those countries with the objective
of gaining economic and trade assistance required by Sri Lanka. The country will receive a high level of cooperation in the field of education, political, economic, cultural, consular, legal
and defence. Many MoUs were signed to fight against terrorism, training Security Forces, granting scholarships for students involved in higher education, enhancing maritime security and prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease. Agreements were also signed to drag many investments to Sri Lanka particularly in the sectors of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, cement, sugar, IT and tourism," he added.
He said the international community has a greater understanding of the governments commitment in marching towards a path to strengthen democracy, independence of the judiciary, respect for the rule of law and ensuring that all communities in Sri Lanka enjoy the dividend of peace which has dawned in the country. The western countries were on the verge of imposing economic sanctions on Sri Lanka, he said due to the weakness of the previous government in handling finance, economic and international relations. "We had a strong executive presidential system with unprecedented powers of controlling financial management. Bi-lateral relations between other countries were very weak. We would have faced many problems unless this
government came into power in 2015. Since then, Sri Lanka has been on a course of democratic transition resulting in improving the protection of human rights which finally met international expectations. Now, the government is winning the hearts and minds of the international community. That is why we regained many benefits like the GSP plus facility, he added.

Be warned of the One Ring Scam
[Expert Advice]
*Do not pick up calls from unknown IDD numbers
*BE CONCERNED OF CALLS EMANATING FROM AFRICAN AND CARIBEAN COUNTRIES
*If you miss a call from a suspicious IDD number, do not call back
*Report all such calls to the TRC and your mobile service provider
As smartphone technology continues to evolve at a fast pace, it has also paved the way for an increasing number of mobile phone scams worldwide. Despite constant reporting and warnings by experts, people continue to fall victim to scammers repeatedly, due to their varying traps and tactics.
Similar mobile phone scams have seen a rise within Sri Lanka in the recent past. From text message scams to phone insurance scams, reports have revealed that Sri Lankan mobile users are now being constantly targeted by local and foreign scammers with many being defrauded out of large amounts of cash.
Roshan Chandragupta
The recent mobile phone fraud to hit Sri Lanka has been the One Ring Scam also popularly called the Wangiri phone scam as many mobile users in the country were hit with a barrage of calls this week from numbers with a foreign IDD codes leaving many people confused. Unable to establish as to where these calls were being placed from, many members of the public were seen voicing their concerns on social media regarding these unusual calls being received by them. With government agencies setting up investigations into the incidents, however according to experts the only way to avoid being scammed is to simply not call back.
One Ring Scam
According to 28-year-old Jehan Perera, he had received a similar call on Monday this week. The IDD code read as +1 (767) while an application on my phone detected it as a incoming call from Dominica, he says adding that he decided to not pick up as he did not personally know anyone from that country.
I felt it was unusual so I did not pick up and neither did I call back, says Jehan explaining that it was only later that he found out he among many others had been targeted by fraudsters in a One Ring Scam.
According to Roshan Chandraguptha, the Information Security Officer of the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) the scam attempts to lure people to return calls to specific IDD numbers where they will be then charged premium IDD rates.
The scam will often start with the scammer obtaining an international premium rate number (IPRN) from a mobile service provider and a potential victim receiving a missed call from the said IDD number. According to experts the scammers will then depend on human curiosity and hope the victim will call back. In addition to the missed calls, you may also receive a text message or email that would ask you to please urgently call back on a given fraudulent number.
If the victim does call back he will possibly face heavy mobile charges ranging from connection fees and further conversion and transfer charges while the scammers will make various attempts to keep the victim on line for as long as possible. According to experts sometimes, these scam numbers will redirect calls to other very expensive numbers while the longer a person stays on call, the higher he will be charged. Scammers might also keep a caller on hold to keep the victim on call for longer period.
During the time unknown to the victim he will be charged high IDD rates for the call being made, for which the scammers will receive a commission of around one USD per call made from the mobile service provider.
It is difficult to say how much the scam victim will be charged, says Chandragupta adding that however, it could possibly even go over a 100 USD.
According to foreign media reports once a victim calls back he could be charged around 19.95 USD as a connection fee along with possible further connection charges as well as per-minute fees of at least Nine USD. Already charged a hefty sum for the call, victims will unfortunately not be able to get their money back in this scam as the charges are completely legal as the call was placed by the victim himself.
International connections
Many reports suggests such calls are mostly originating from countries such as Burundi, Malawi, Pakistan, Belarus among many others such as various islands in the West Indies as seen by the calls being received from Sri Lankan mobile users. Reports say some of the IDD codes that have been used in these scams are 268, 809, 876, 284, and 473.
Fortunate for many mobile users in the country the unusual nature rather than peak their curiosity to call back had instead moved them to take precautions against any such calls.
According to the TRC, while many callers had not responded to the missed calls however, those who returned the call had been charged an exorbitant amount of money for returning the call to that number. Some mobile phone users had said they had received calls from the United States while others had received calls from various Caribbean destinations.
The TRC says that Interconnection charges during such calls can be extremely high which has possibly resulted in hefty charges noticed by local victims.
Take precautions- donot answer
Meanwhile, the TRC has also reached out to local mobile service providers regarding the recent scam. Releasing a statement according to the TRC, Mobitel has blocked incoming calls from such numbers in the interest of their customers while similar action had been taken by Dialog Axiata. Other service providers had informed the commission that any similar fraudulent calls will be blocked while however, they claim no customer complaints regarding such calls had been received by them.
With many complaints being received by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRC) regarding such cold calls, the TRC along with the Sri Lanka Telecom have now commenced two separate investigations into the incidents.
While mobile providers have taken possible action in this regard, experts too have advised the public to refrain from entertaining such calls.
Members of the public should be wary of any calls being received from unknown IDD numbers, Chandragupta says adding that the only way to avoid being scammed is to simply not call back. This is the only way to not fall victim to these fraudsters, he said.

Ceylon Tea one of Sl's top five export earners
Celebrates 150th Anniversary this year:
Ceylon Tea one of the top five export earners of Sri Lanka elebrates 150th Anniversary this year
150 years ago, the pioneers of Ceylon Tea, cultivated the land, built the infrastructure and laid out the foundation for an industry to be nurtured and grown. Today, producing 350 million kilograms annually and employing over two percent of the population of Sri Lanka, Ceylon Tea has become one of the top five export earners of Sri Lanka.
Tea, inherently has been Sri Lankas most important agricultural commodity. With its beginning in 1867, when the enterprising young Scotsman James Taylor experimented with tea as a replacement for the then disease ridden coffee industry, the Ceylon Tea industry celebrates its 150th year anniversary in 2017.
The Colombo Tea Traders Association (CTTA) together with the Sri Lanka Tea Board, and supported by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and all the stakeholders of the Tea Industry, is celebrating this momentous sesquicentennial of the industry that sustained Sri Lankas economy for over 100 years with many events taking place throughout 2017.
The celebrations began with the unveiling of James Taylors monument at the Sri Lanka Tea Boards premises in January 2017. Two Educational fairs too were held, one in Nuwara-Eliya and the other in Pilimathalawe, with the aim of educating the children of plantation families on the importance of the tea industry and its sustenance. A tea festival to is being planned to bring people from various sectors and countries, together.
A major event planned by the CTTA is the Global Ceylon Tea Party. Beginning in Fiji, down to New Zealand and continuing in every time zone a tea party will be held in the relevant Countries at 5 p.m. in each time zone on 6th of July 2017. This will make it a continuous, twenty four hour global Ceylon Tea party. With the endorsement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka, the CTTA will coordinate the tea parties, which will be hosted in the relevant time zones by the Heads of Missions of Sri Lanka. The CTTA is also supported in this venture by Sri Lankas oldest confectioner Maliban Biscuits who have produced a biscuit with the 150 year logo in a special flavour of Earl Grey and also of Ginger, especially for the global tea party.
A charity auction of tea and tea memorabilia , in which the eight main operating brokers of the Colombo Tea Auction will be presenting five tea related sterling silver items, such as a tea pot, a model of the oldest tea roller, a tea tasting scale and a gavel, a model tea tasting set etc., will be auctioned. The funds collected from the charity auction will go towards activities to improve the quality of life and provision of health benefits of the estate workers. The Tea Industry will also release a publication on the history of its 150 year existence with interesting and beautiful illustrations of Sri Lankas Tea Country.
The launch of this publication will take place on the same day as the charity auction, on July 20.
Furthermore, two stamps and a first day cover as well as a Rs.10 coin which will be in circulation will be issued in celebration of the 150 years of Ceylon Tea.
This commemorative coin too will be ceremonial released for public circulation in July 2017.
The grand finale of the 150th Anniversary will be the Tea Convention, which is expected to be attended by more than 200 overseas delegates. Eminent global speakers will discuss topics ranging from tea to motivation, packaging and mechanization etc., towards empowering the future of the Tea industry in Sri Lanka.
The many events planned to commemorate the sesquicentennial of Ceylon Tea will reflect the importance of the industry that has immensely contributed to the economy of Sri Lanka for 150 years and strategies for its sustenance in the future, too.

The letter: I regret to note that Ratnapura Special Correspondent for the Daily News, N D Rajadorai has misquoted me in the aforesaid article, wherein he had mentioned that I had said: Earlier, the Election Commissioner had powers to act on his own. But now delays have occurred because there were three officers to take decisions.
This is contradictory to what I had told the media in Sinhala. I wanted to emphasise the importance of the collective decisions made by a three member Commission. When the Department of Elections was in existence, the decisions were made by the then Commissioner of Elections. At present, all the decisions have to be made collectively by the members of the Election Commission, including the Chairman.

Colombo outskirts better for real estate investment - Study
To the casual observer the growing demand for high-rise apartment projects  or for vertical living, as sometimes called - is already evident from the spate of construction projects altering the city's skyline and more recently, its immediate surroundings.
A study published by Jones Lang LaSalle, confirms this notion.
The report 'Real Estate in Sri Lanka - Prospects and Potential -Translating Economic Growth into Real Estate Developments in Colombo states that due to increase in price within Colombo city, a rising percentage of the working population is moving to the suburbs, which are much cheaper in comparison. A house in the bordering areas of the city is 26 percent cheaper than a similar house in the city centre.
These clear economic advantages predict a shift towards demand for housing on the outskirts of the city limits.
The report states that Sri Jayewardene Kotte, witnessed relocation of major administrative offices and residences leading to a further spurt in real estate activity.
It is fast becoming a retail and residential (high and middle-income) destination.
Rajagiriya is a classic case in point. Located between the rapidly developing Battaramulla/ Kotte and the always-in-demand Colombo, land prices in Rajagiriya has, curiously, not kept pace with its flashier neighbours.
The rise in real estate values in both Colombo and Kotte has suddenly made land in Rajagiriya, situated on the immediate eastern border of Colombo cheap in comparison.
One of the crucial areas identified by the Kotte city development plan 2008-2020, Rajagiriya is identified as a mixed development zone with both residential and commercial values and is recognized as one of the most transit areas of the capital.
The flyover, under construction right now designed by the RDA to blend in with city architecture, attempts to address this critical situation.
One company that has seen the mismatch of land prices to demand in Rajagiriya and moved swiftly to exploit the opportunity is Millennium Housing Developers PLC (MHD).
Having ascertained that demand for apartments priced around Rs. 2535 million is growing faster than in other price bands, especially for those on the citys border, MHD raced ahead securing properties at Edmonton Road, Kirulapana, then Nawala Road, Narahenpita (Colombo 05) and now at 504, Rajagiriya Road, Rajagiriya.
Location wise, the Green Heights at 504 Rajagiriya is unique due to its situation at the highest point in Colombo, a fact not lost to the company or its customers since a good view is paramount in selection of a location by all.
MHDs outlook on luxury apartment in the outskirts is that customers can get greater value in terms of living style and standards, simply because the developers outlay on land is lower here than in Colombo; giving customers a much shorter commute and a higher standard of luxury at a lower price.

District reconciliation committees to resolve ethnic, religious issues
President Maithripala Sirisena has proposed to set up district level national reconciliation committees to resolve ethnic and religious issues.
The District Secretary is to be appointed as the convener of these committees. Cabinet also released a statement condemning the recent attacks on Muslim shops,
businesses and religious institutions and directed the Attorney General to expedite action taken against all perpetrators.
The media however questioned as to why no action has been taken against the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera whose organisation is alleged to be involved in many of the incidents and has four police teams after him on contempt of court charges.
Co-cabinet spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne and Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing however assured that the Police will soon take necessary action.
Q. Azath Sally has stated that a government minister is providing protection to Ven. Gnanasara Thera
Minister Senaratne: Minister Champika Ranawakas name had come up in relation to the BBS but he made a statement in Cabinet yesterday saying that he had no connection to them and that it was Attorney-at-law Manohara De Silva who was representing them. Silva happens to be working for Mahinda Rajapaksa and he knows where he is.
Q. Why is there a delay in arresting him
A. They will arrest him soon.
Q. In the burning of the factory in Nawalapitiya, Minister Hakeem stated that it had been set on fire but the owner said it was due to an electrical failure. Wont such statements harm reconciliation
Minister Senaratne: Yes, unnecessary problems crop up when statements are made without people knowing the full facts.
Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara: The police must be allowed to do their work. If Azath Sally is making such statements, he must give these details to the Police so they can carry out their investigations. Simply alleging that a minister is involved will not solve anything. Ministers do not have any need to hide anyone. We all want action to be taken and the process of reconciliation to go ahead. We are ready to take action against any force which is against that.
Q. When the shops in Maharagama were set on fire no action was taken
Minister Senaratne: As ministers we need to take action not talk. When the shops were initially burnt, I called the IGP and asked him to take action but he said it was some other case. But then I said there have been 23 such cases so far, all cannot be something else. Muslim MPs then showed me CCTV footage of the shops being set on fire and I showed it to the Police and thereafter they found who was responsible. The police are working on arresting other suspects related to these attacks.
The suspect has admitted to be a member of the BBS and he had participated in many of their protests. Thereafter we only had one incident reported in Mahiyangana where a shop run by a Muslim was set on fire.
This government did not come into power on the race card. On January 8, we won on a platform against racism and we showed that Sinhalese politicians can win without using racism to stir ethnic tensions and violence and by standing for rights of all. So the government will stand by that principle and take action against any who go against that.
Q. How can you put the blame on Gnanasara Thera alone There are many monks who are supporting him, do you not think this is a conspiracy to get him arrested
Minister Jayasekara: On one side you have people saying that Muslims with the intervention of certain politicians are grabbing lands, on the other side Gnanasara and groups have come under attack for religious violence. The actions of both these groups are affecting national unity and reconciliation. We have the police, archaeology department and other government institutions to solve these issues but without letting them do their job, these people jump in and scold those officials.
The more people who try to take it into their own hands, there will be more problems between ethnic groups. As a government we want to resolve this issue but we are being accused of taking sides
Minister Senaratne: From the time this government came into power, the number of incidents have decreased. We are at least looking for Gnanasara Thera, what did the previous regime do What happened to Aluthgama No action taken
Q. The current government promised an investigation into Aluthgama too. What action have you taken with that regard
Minister Senaratne: I am not sure, I will have to find out about that.

Drama Queens!
Being creative and learning to make creative choices helps students to be better at thinking up new ideas. It allows them to view the world around them in new ways. Confidence gained from learning performing arts skills applies to school, career, and life.
This is one of the main intentions behind the International Convention on Students Quality Circles (ICSQC). The event was held for the first time in 1997 and was initiated by the City Montessori School in Lucknow, India, to propagate the quality circle philosophy among students worldwide. Now in its 20th chapter the ICSQC was held in Embilipitiya in the Sabaragamuwa Province this year from May 14 to 19. The Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council had provided the participants with food and lodging free of charge. Student delegates from around 20 countries competed in seven categories to showcase their skills at the event. Students had to show their talents in skit presentation, case study presentation, poster and slogan making, quiz, debate, student parliament and collage events. Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya, Colombo, stood out at the competition as they won many accolades in the event.
We had 14 members in our Quality Circle this year. They took part in all the categories from our school. We won first place in skit presentation. Dinethmi Jayawardana won the Best Actress award for her performance as the king. We also got a special commendation awards for the case study presentation and the poster and slogan making categories, Imara Gamage, the schools Quality Circle team leader and head prefect said.
Apart from Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya, Ananda Vidyalaya, Nalanda Vidyalaya, Mahanama Vidyalaya and Devi Balika Vidyalaya took part in ICSQC 2017.
The Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya Quality Circle students with teacher in charge, Kumani Boyagoda
The Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya drama troupe consisted of six members: Dinethmi Jayawardana, Siluni Nayananda, Dinethma Supulvi Jayashantha, Roshelle Perera, Ihansa Karunaratne and Rashini Dias. The case study presentation consisted of four members: Imara Gamage, Gihini Gunawardena, Samadhi Fernando, Samindi Weerakoon and Roshelle Perera. Tharushi Liyanage and Saneesha Sandamini handled the poster and slogan making as well as the collage category. Dinethmi Jayawardana and Siluni Nayananda represented the student parliament. They were the two students selected from Sri Lanka to represent this category from the western parlaiment. Dinethmi Jayawardana and Roshelle Perera handled the debate while Thirani Athukorala and Siluni Kannangara took part in the quiz. Students from grade 10 and 12 were selected to take part in the events. The whole project was spearheaded by Kumani Boyagoda who is the teacher in charge of Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalayas Quality Circle.
The theme given for the skits was how to combat disaster management through adequate decisions. It needs to run for around 10 minutes. The Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalayas Quality Circle team based their skit on a popular folk tale: the fables of King Kekille. They concentrated on environment conservation in their play. The drama Dawn of a Green Dream was scripted by Dinethma Supulvi Jayashantha. It was translated into English by Nilmini Mahanama, an English teacher at the school. Jayani Kapuge developed and directed the drama. She also designed the costumes for Dawn of a Green Dream. She has also been the teacher who led the schools team in the skit presentation category at the ICSQC for four years.
Speaking about how she came across her storyline Dinethma noted that she went through several folk tales before finally deciding to use the fables of King Kekille as the basis for her script.
I changed the characters a bit to suit the storyline. I have written several scripts before for the school. I also played the role of Andare in Dawn of a Green Dream, she explained.
Reflecting on the moment when she was named as the Best Actress at the event Dinethmi said that it took time for the news to sink in.
I was happy to bring such pride to my school. I feel that all our efforts and hard work had been well rewarded, she said.
Ihansa Karunaratne plays a pivotal role in the drama. She is the goddess who gets the message across to the audience. She said that that her whole team was determined to win the event.
Siluni Nayananda who took on the character of Chief Advisor said that though that was her role, the Chief Advisor always worked in a manner to please the king.
Finally it was the goddess who gave the best advice, she noted with a smile.
Rashini Dias who gave life to the Chief Minister said that hers was a comic role. She has taken part in many school dramas before and has mostly done comic roles.
I believe that my ability to change my voice to suit many characters gave me this opportunity, she said.
Speaking about the challenges they encountered at the event Roshelle Perera who played the role of the mason said that the biggest chalange was how to make use of the full 10 minutes to get their message across.
Our success is mainly due to team work. We overcame many challenges to emerge as the winners of this category. I admired the skit presented by Devi Balika Vidyalaya a lot. They have interwoven their story with lively music. They became first runners up at the event, she said.
Students of Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya have won first place in the skit presentation category in 2011 as well. They have also won the Best Actress award several times.
Tharushi Liyanage and Saneesha Sandamini who represented both the poster and slogan and collage categories were under Vishanthika Mallika Hewas charge. They said that they used natural products to make their creations.
The students said that they wish to thank their principal R A M R Herath, Associate principal in charge of all the societies Champa Illangakoon and Kumari Senaratne who assisted them in the case study. Their parents too have been very supportive towards the project.
Speaking about the competition she was involved in Samindi Weerakoon said that the case study involved a systematic way in disposing organic garbage found within the school premises. The girls had even made a barrel out of discarded materials to make compost as a part of the project.
The most important thing you learn by taking part in ICSQC is that everything you present has to be of quality. You get a training in various sectors which prepares you on how to handle events in the future. You learn about time management and how to work as a team by taking part in this program. You also get an opportunity to interact and see the methods that other student delegates use in the competition, she noted adding that all the practices were done after school.
Taking part in such a competition benefits you in the long run. It actually helps to motivate you in your studies rather than become a hindrance. For example one needs to engage in a lot of case studies when one begins to pursue higher education. ICSQC is a doorway for us on what is expected in case studies. We faced a lot of problems tackling the case study. We could not identify the issue correctly in the first place. The short time period we were given to complete the case study was another challenge but we managed to resolve all our issues in the end, Imara added with a smile.

'Dusit Thani Balapitiya project would be a success'
JLL launches Sri Lanka Land of Real Estate Opportunities report:
Global real estate consulting firm JLL launched a comprehensive new report titled Sri Lanka  Land of Real Estate Opportunities. The publication addresses a strong demand for accessible, in-depth analysis into the domestic property market.
Through the new report, JLL aims to create a dialogue on the varied challenges which local and international investors face when engaging in real estate transactions in Sri Lanka, in addition to enumerating on the unprecedented scope of opportunity for valuable investments in the countrys rapidly developing property sector.
The launch of our report coincides with Sri Lankas first wave of high-end real estate development projects in both the residential and commercial segments, said Steven Mayes, Managing Director, JLL Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. This marks a significant milestone for the domestic market, which we believe holds the potential to become one of the South Asian regions most promising success stories.
The launch of our report coincides with Sri Lankas first wave of high-end real estate development projects in both the residential and commercial segments, said Steven Mayes, Managing Director, JLL Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. This marks a significant milestone for the domestic market, which we believe holds the potential to become one of the South Asian regions most promising success stories.
He added, There are challenges that need to be addressed, of course; Sri Lanka is prone to limited but notable downside risks, largely arising out of the currently subdued levels of Foreign Direct Investment and a high fiscal deficit. Nevertheless, we see strong demand for Grade A commercial office spaces.
Coupled with the major growth potential over the medium-long term catalyzed by major infrastructure development projects like the Colombo International Financial City and the Western Region Megapolis, we believe that the overall outlook for the Sri Lankan real estate sector is strong. He also said that they see the model of Dusit Thani Beachfront Balapitiya mixed development project as a successful one and a new concept for Sri Lanka. The pricing is very attractive and the concept of managing by the owners and also giving a two week holiday for the owner per year too is attractive.
He said that the Dusit Thani Beachfront Balapitiya model where they guarantee a return on investment of 6% too is very encouraging.
Meanwhile Ajit Wijesinghe, Managing Director of Indola Group, developers of the Dusit Thani Sri Lanka, Beachfront Balapitiya had said, The Sri Lankan Rupee has devalued more than 40% over the last 5 years, so effectively if you are receiving 13% from a local bank per annum and the rupee devalues 10%, then your actual earnings would only be 3% ( according to national statistics).
It is said that if one purchase a luxury Dusit Thani Beachfront Apartment at Balapitiya, Sri Lanka investments would grow.
In addition to this, we anticipate massive Capital Gains growth potential.
The management guarantees a 6% return on investment per annum, paid in US$ for 5 years.

Duvindu Silva, a star cricketer in the making
Duvindu Silva is a 12-year-old budding cricketer who showed great promise at tender age. But not like for many young cricketers, Duvindus school, Maharagama Highland School does not included cricket in their sports activities. Duvindus passion for cricket guided his parents to enter him to the Sanath Jayasuriya Cricket Academy. His talent as an all-rounder was identified there and bestowed the captaincy of academys under-13 team while making him the teams opening batsman.
He toured with the team to several regional countries such as Malaysia and India where his credentials were highly praised by foreign media. Duvindu is a stylish right hand batsman with a high technical accuracy. His best batting performance was against under-17 Anuradhapura district schools united team where he scored 120 runs remaining in the wicket from opener to the last man. The twelve-year lad hammered all the elderly opponent bowlers with no mercy in his superb knock. He bowled best against touring Brisbane Cricket Academy under 14 team with his venomous off-spine bowling spell to capture 6/24.
Duvindu excelled at the annual inter-house cricket tournament of the academy and guided the Balck Cats team to U-13 title under his captaincy. With no other cricket practices than the two-hour weekly session at the Sanath Jayasuriya Cricket Academy, Duvindu has proven his potential in the sport of gentlemen. But he badly need a cricket playing school to continue his cricket career. Duvindu appreciates the support he receive from the Academys coaches, his personal coach Chamara Guruge, his parents, Mahendra Kumara and Chamari Siddhisena. He also thanked his only brother Pasindu Silva for all the encouragement.

Extending unity
Having faced varied challenges related to natural disasters, Cabinet reshuffles and trade unions action from several quarters, the National Unity government is gearing itself to face yet another looming hurdle: the renewal of the accord between the United National Party (UNP) and the mainstream Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
The agreement between the two major political parties in the country, unparalleled in the countrys nearly seventy years of post-independence politics, came into being in the aftermath of the 2015 August general elections.
At this election, held seven months after President Maithripala Sirisena was elected to office in January that year, the UNP emerged as the single largest party, securing 106 seats. However this fell well short of the 113 seats required for a simple, working majority.
Prior to the election, the SLFPs campaign was in disarray as nominees backing former President Mahinda Rajapaksa were scrambling to get into the nomination lists of the various electoral districts, despite opposition from the Sirisena camp.
This culminated in President Sirisena going public with an unprecedented address to the nation stating that even if the SLFP emerged as the single largest party after the poll, he would not be appointing Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister.
Despite these reversals, the SLFP-led coalition emerged a decent second at the election, securing 95 seats. Crucially for the President, a majority of those elected from the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), about 51 parliamentarians, were Rajapaksa loyalists. The third largest party was the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) with 16 seats while the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) secured six seats.
Presidents rolein government
Given this scenario, the UNP and its leadership, seven seats short of a working majority in Parliament, were weighing three options. It could function as a minority government and attempt to secure the support of the TNA (and indeed the JVP) for legislation it wished to introduce on a case by case basis.
This would not have appealed to the UNP because it had already spent eight months as a minority government from January to August and found that it was tough going, with no stability or authority, resulting in chaotic situations from time to time.
The second option which the UNP could have pursued was perhaps the most tempting. It could have easily invited about ten handpicked SLFPers to join the government, probably from among those loyal to President Sirisena. That would have ensured a working majority in Parliament and also strengthened the Presidents role in government.
This was a tactic employed time and again with great finesse by Rajapaksa when he was President. Rajapaksa poached selected politicians from the UNP almost at will by offering them Cabinet portfolios, strengthening his own numbers in Parliament and weakening the UNP at the same time.
For example, Gamini Lokuge, Keheliya Rambukwella and Johnston Fernando all began their political careers in the UNP and later joined the Rajapaksa Cabinet. There were several others such as Mahinda Samarasinghe, Dayasiri Jayasekera and Sarath Amunugama who did the same, but they have since shifted their loyalties once again- and are now in the Sirisena camp.
Constitutional changes
The UNP too would have been tempted to try this tactic. However, there was one difficulty with this option: while inviting a handful of SLFPers would secure a simple majority for the UNP, it would fall way short of the two-thirds majority it would need if it intended to pursue constitutional changes.
Indeed, constitutional changes, vis--vis changing the executive presidential system of government, reforming the electoral system and introducing amendments to redress ethnic grievances were all high on the UNPs agenda. Hence it opted for a different arrangement instead- an alliance with the entire SLFP faction loyal to President Sirisena.
With 106 MPs of the UNP and about 44 MPs of the mainstream SLFP, such an alliance would be able to secure a two-thirds majority in Parliament. If such a government was formed, there was also the perception that President Sirisena could entice a few more SLFPers to his camp, if the circumstances warranted it. Thus, an agreement was reached between the UNP and the mainstream SLFP.
The agreement took the shape of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). This MoU was signed on August 21, 2015. UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim and then SLFP Acting General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake signed the MoU at the Presidential Secretariat soon after the swearing in for Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The agreement was for a period of two years- with provision for extension if both parties agreed to do so. Both parties also agreed that during the period of this agreement, public representatives from both parties will not be permitted to cross over to another party.
It is this two year deadline that looms ahead in about two months. Although the relationship between the UNP and the SLFP has been fraught at times, many note that to see through the agreement for two years, given the polarities of the two parties, is by itself an achievement.
However there are rumblings of dissent- in both camps although the SLFP has been more vocal about it. Some SLFP ministers, notably the two Dissnayakes, S.B. and Duminda, have been openly proclaiming that President Sirisena would be the candidate of the SLFP at the next presidential elections.
This runs counter to the Presidents pledge to abolish the Executive Presidency which underpinned his entire presidential election campaign. To be fair by the President, he has never endorsed these calls by his ministers- but then, nor has he aggressively denied them.
Other ministers- such as Nimal Siripala de Silva- frequently make public utterances to the effects that he is a minister in the government only because it is headed by a SLFPer and that he dreams of the day when a purely SLFP government could be formed. Needless to say, these types of comments from senior SLFPers havent helped the relationship between the two parties.
Cabinet reshuffle
The UNP is annoyed that a Cabinet reshuffle was imposed on them at the behest of the SLFP. It managed to save face with a swap between the Finance and Foreign ministries but a SLFP minister, Dayasiri Jayasekera (who ironically is an ex-UNPer) is now rubbing salt into the UNPs wounds, being critical of the allocation of the lotteries boards under the Foreign Minister.
It is a matter of disappointment that the primary objective of establishing a UNP-SLFP partnership- enacting constitutional amendments through the two-thirds majority that such a partnership delivers- has not seen the light of day.
Understandably, constitution making cannot be done overnight and a draft constitution is in the making but the government would do well to note that two years of its tenure are over and that enacting a new Constitution closer to the next general election (or presidential election, if there is one), could be a political nightmare.
The major question for the National Unity government in the coming weeks though is sustaining the UNP-mainstream SLFP alliance.
Clearly, both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe see no reason to change the status quo. If at all, they would want to introduce provisions to the MoU to minimise the intra-party sniping between loquacious ministers.
At this point in time, indications are that the MoU will indeed be renewed, probably for another two years. If not, the UNP would have to scour the Parliament for another ally, just as much as Prime Minister Theresa May is doing in Britain in the aftermath of their election.
That is extremely unlikely at this stage and the coming weeks will see an extension of the agreement, although there will be those opposed to this both in the UNP and the mainstream SLFP. They will be asked by the leaders of both parties to hold their horses- at least for the foreseeable future.

Flood victims to get Rs.7,500 house rent allowance
The government will provide a monthly house rent allowance of Rs.7,500 to victims of the recent floods so that they can move out of shelters and into temporary accommodation until their houses are repaired.
The rent allowance is set to cover the period from June to August.
We hope to complete reconstruction work within the next three months but if it is longer, we will extend their rent payments, Co-Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
He was addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing.
"The floods which affected 15 districts in the country displaced 152,152 families with 3,037 houses completely damaged and 25,647 houses partially damaged. The government at present has set up 145 welfare centres for 2,937 families in the Kalutara, Matara and Galle districts.
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa has informed Cabinet that it was also cheaper for the government to provide rent than to continue to house them in shelters. According to government calculations, it cost Rs.42,400 to supply food and other supplies to a family of four per month.
He also informed Cabinet that those who can return to their homes have been granted an advance of Rs.10,000 by through the Divisional Secretariats.
Yapa also pointed out that the maintenance of these shelters prolonged the return of normal life of the flood affected people.
Cabinet on Tuesday also approved Minister Yapas proposal to fill the vacancies in the National Disaster Relief Centre (NDRC) with immediate effect, to attach a Disaster Relief Officer to each Divisional Secretary Division and to create new posts for essential duties to strengthen the disaster relief mechanism at the district and divisional level.

A garbage recycling project commenced by the Kirinda-Puhulwella Pradeshiya Sabha has at present achieved significant progress, residents said.
This project is currently in operation at Wahtucolakanda in Puhulwella. The garbage, hard waste and other waste matter collected in the Kirinda-Puhulwella towns and other sub towns and villages are brought to this centre and recycled and converted into compost.
According to cultivation committee and farmer organization members, the division of Kirinda-Puhulwella Pradeshiya Sabha is mainly an agricultural zone. Paddy cultivation is the main-stay of the rural economy.
Garbage management and compost production projects have boosted environmental preservation and conservation in the area. In addition, several direct and indirect employment opportunities for the unemployed in the area have also been created through this project.
The environmental conservation and encouragement of farmers to utilize organic manure rather than chemical fertilizer would be twin objectives of this endeavour, project officials said.

Govt. urged to review decision
Ban on polythene wrapping sheets and increase in thickness:
Polythene Manufacturers and Recyclers Association yesterday urged the government to rethink their decision to ban polythene wrapping sheets and increase the minimum thickness of polythene bags from 20 to 40 microns.
Association President Anura Wijetunge told the media in Colombo that the twin decisions slated to take effect in the near future will badly hurt the industry as well as heap more burden on the consumer.
Wijetunge said the industry will have to import a large quantity of material to meet the 40 microns requirement making more foreign exchange outflows. The move will make release more polythene to the environment, he said.
Rs. 20,018 million was spent on imports related to the polythene manufacturing last year. In 2006, before the Central Environment Authority brought the micron 20 law, the amount was only Rs. 8,163 million, Wijetunge said.
"If the thickness of bags is to be increased to 40 microns, we will have to spend more monies for imports, he said.
"If the governments intention in increasing the thickness of polythene packing material is to discourage its use, an alternative has to be given first as polythene has become the cheapest and most used packing material in the country," Wijetunge said
He said no country has banned polythene.
In developed countries, per capita polythene consumption is around 80 kgs, but in our country, this is 6 kgs. The developed countries are not facing environmental hazards due to polythene as they have waste management methods. The answer to the issue is not banning polythene, but having effective laws, regulations and methods in waste management, he said.
Meanwhile, Association Secretary Anura Herath said members of the association can produce degradable and compostable polythene if the government can do away with the 20 micron law.
He said such polythene will break into small particles within a year and will be fully degradable within five years.
Meanwhile, Association Vice President Vijitha Warnakulasuriya said the amount of polythene in the environment and money on imports related to the industry can be reduced with proper recycling.
Warnakulasuriya said this was not happening in a big way due to deficiencies in the waste collection methods. He said if used polythene can be collected separately, they can be effectively recycled and reused.
He said the Central Environmental Authority had not consulted the association before deciding on the new laws and added that their suggestions over the years to streamline the industry and minimise health hazards have fallen on deaf ears.
The association suggested proposals to overcome the issue, including proper waste management, implementing the 20 micron law to the letter, encouraging the production of degradable polythene, a national policy on waste management and encouraging recycling and reuse.

## Title: GURUSINHA Sri Lanka crickets UNSUNG HERO
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, June 15, 2017 - 01:00
GURUSINHA Sri Lanka crickets UNSUNG HERO
The number 3 batting spot is a spot that is usually occupied by the best batsman in the team. That is because he has to be the rock on which a teams innings is built. From the moment he takes strike, he must be confidence, technique and determination personified.
He must have the ability to act as opening batsman at times. That is because at times he will have to face the new ball in case one of the opening batsmen is out early before the shine is gone off the ball. So it will be seen that a great responsibility rests on the shoulders of the one drop batsman.
Down the ages all teams playing cricket have carried with them some top notch first drop batsmen. It will be too tedious to name them. And one Sri Lankan batsman who adorned this position with great ability and seldom failed his team was ASANKA PRADEEP GURUSINHA.
He seldom failed
From the time GURUSINHA donned pads in this responsible slot, he seldom failed. Many a big total his team built was attributed to GURUSINHA who stood tall defying many a fast bowler, sticking unflinchingly in the middle and inspiring batsmen following how to negotiate the devil in the wicket or the pace or spin and building an innings of great importance to the team.
With clever footwork he cut and drove powerfully and his chief scoring stroke was the well executed admirable lofted off drive that earned him a bag full of runs.
His ability in the one drop position was never better exemplified than when his team was two down early in the 1995/96 history- making World Cup final triumph in Lahore, Pakistan against Australia having lost the two opening blasters in Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaliuwitharne early.
Correct pitch for victory
He partnered the man of the final and vice captain Aravinda de Silva to stall the Aussie push putting on a stand of 125 to put the Lankans on the correct pitch for victory. GURUSINHA made a memorable and admirable 65. That is one knock that will be etched in his memory.
When he first served notice of his immense batting prowess at Isipathana and then Nalanda College, he was a burly wicket keeper/batsman with a liking to blast every ball. He had a successful run in school cricket and when he joined the Sinhalese Sports Club that he quickly began to mature and take on responsibility and shape his batting skills that were oozing to finally end up as one of the best left handed willow wielders produced by the country.
He was licked into shape early in his career by coach Raja Athukorale a former Wesley College opening batsman and my work and team mate at The Times of Ceylon and my team mate at the Burgher Recreation Club where we helped the Burghers win the Daily News and Donovan Andree Trophies. GURA was later coached by Nelson Mendis.
Successful cricket stint
GURUSINHA was born on September 16 1966. After a successful cricket stint at Nalanda as a wicket keeper/batsman, he joined Nondescripts Cricket Club before finally nesting at the adjoining Sinhalese Sports Club, where he proved that he was national class and it was not long when he sported the national cap.
An unforgettable effort was when he partnered Arjuna Ranatunga and batted the entire day at the Colombo Oval to save the Test against a mighty Pakistan side led by all rounder Imran Khan. They became the first two Lankan batsmen to bat throughout the entire day.
On a tour of New Zealand in 1991, he became the second batter after the mercurial Duleep Mendis to score twin hundreds in a Test at Snedden Park, Hamilton making 119 and 102. I was present describing the action for the DAILY NEWS and SUNDAY OBSERVERVER and savored those two knocks in the company of former West Indies opening bat Bruce Pairadeu.
Nicely poised for victory
At the end of the fourth day, Sri Lanka were nicely poised to record a first Test victory after former opener and later Manager of Sri Lanka cricket team Charith Senanayake led the victory charge with a dashing over 50 innings. But on the final day for no unaccountable reason Sri Lanka put up shutters and a Test that could have ended in a memorable first victory was allowed to peter out into a draw.
Unfortunately GURUSINHA'S career ended prematurely when he was just 29 and at the time his game was at its peak. Today cricketers keep on playing well past their 30s. With GURUSINHAS early exit Sri Lanka cricket was the loser.
GURUSINHA made his entry into the elite league against Pakistan in the Third Test at Karachi. He played as a wicket keeper owing to an injury suffered by regular wicket keeper Amal Silva.
Was not a dream debut
His debut was not a dream one scoring only 17 and 12 in that Test. Even his ODI debut was a disaster being run out without scoring. GURUSINHA in scoring a fighting 116 against Pakistan in the Third Test in Colombo became the youngest Lanka to make a Test century.
GURUSINHA had aggression writ on his batting always endeavoring to keep the scoreboard moving quickly. But when the need arose he could get bogged down as he showed when he stroked the third slowest hundred of all time when against Zimbabwe in Harare he reached the three figure mark in 535 minutes. He finally made 128 off 461 balls in 607 minutes.
Sensational win for Aussies  sub head
I was present at the SSC in 1992 watching the First Test against Allan Border Australians and this story was told to me after the game ended in a sensational victory for Australia. Sri Lanka were well set to register their first ever Test victory against the Aussies.
Aiming at a comparatively easy target of 181 after a formidable start by Roshan Mahanama and Chandika Hathurusinghe were blown away for 164 losing by just 16 runs with GURA remaining unbeaten on 31. Unable to believe that a certain victory was finally lost made GURA cry like a kid in the pavilion.
Even today where ever fans who watched that match gather, they still cant understand how Sri Lanka gifted Australia that victory.
GURUSINHA was certainly Sri Lanka crickets UNSUNG HERO.

Health Ministry appeals to the public to help combat dengue

The Health Ministry has appealed to the public to use mosquito nets whenever they sleep and apply mosquito repellents at home, school and office in a bid to curb the spread of dengue.
On Fridays, from 9.30 a.m. to 10. 30 a.m. the entire country should clean homes, schools, offices and all the other state and private institutions, Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J.M.W.Jayasundara Bandara said.
According to Dr. Bandara a total of 61,844 dengue patients and around 160 dengue deaths had been reported from all parts of the country during this year up to June 12. The highest number of dengue patients, 25,953, is from the Western Province.
It is observed that garbage disposal is not satisfactory at all. There will be an intensive dengue control program in 21 districts on June 15t and 16. Homes will be inspected and fogging will be done during these two days. A three months long National Mosquito Control Program is now in progress,  he said.
Dr Bandara said that the Health officers and members from armed forces will inspect homes and all the other places all over the country in order to make sure that owners / users of all premises in the country cleaned them from 9.30 am to 10.30 am on every Friday.

Heart surgeries in every province soon - Dr. Senaratne
The government will establish mini heart surgery theatres (cath labs) in every province, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
We are in the process of establishing a cardiac catheterisation laboratory in every province. This will help minimise the out of pocket expenses of heart patients while reducing the waiting period for surgeries, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said addressing the Sri Lanka Heart Associations 17th Annual Academic Sessions held in Colombo recently.
Dr. Senaratne said the Health Ministry spends a large percentage of its Rs.85 billion budget to provide free services for interventional, surgical and medical management of cardiac patients in Sri Lanka.
He said the governments efforts in fighting non-communicable diseases or life style diseases, such as setting up of healthy life style centers islandwide, introduction of traffic light systems of control for sugar, salt and trans-fats, restrictions in tobacco and alcohol marketing will also help in mitigating this trend.
Cardiology services are available in all major hospitals with the appointment of consultant cardiologists to all provincial and district General Hospitals, he said.
We are also in the process of revising the procurement procedures to ensure a continuous supply of stents, balloons and catheters to ensure smooth running of the newly setup chain of cath labs.
It is also my wish to upgrade the national cardiology unit at NHSL, the minister said.

Lanka pays dearly for missed opportunities
Eliminated in group stage of ICC Champions Trophy:
Almost two years ago in September 2015, Jerome Jayaratne who was then interim head coach branded the Sri Lanka team as the worst fielding side in Asia.
At the time Jayaratane said, We are now the worst fielding side in Asia, we were never behind Pakistan but now we have gone behind them. India proved that they were better than us and even Bangladesh are fielding better than us."
A lot of water has passed under the bridge since that remark was made and yet today the Sri Lanka team finds itself in almost the same position as we were two years ago.
Who is to blame for this malady Sri Lanka fielding has never lowered itself to such despairing depths, not since they won the 1996 Cricket World Cup.
Prior to the ICC Champions Trophy, a lot of emphasis was placed on Sri Lankas fielding and fitness with several training sessions and camps held and foreign expertise got down at very great cost to Sri Lanka Cricket to iron out the deficiencies displayed on the field, but yet the problem continues to persist.
There was a lot of hype prior to the departure of the team to England that they would perform outstandingly well and even bring back the Champions Trophy. That confidence came on the back of the preparations that the team underwent at home as well as in England where they went weeks ahead to get the players acclimatized to the English weather and pitches which they would encounter in early June.
Despite all the training and fitness regimes the players were put under Sri Lanka still went into their tournament opener against South Africa without their captain Angelo Mathews who suffered a calf injury. Mathews is the most experienced batsman in the Sri Lankan middle order and his absence was sorely felt when Sri Lanka failed to chase down a target of 300 folding up from 94-1 to 203.
To add insult to injury stand-in captain Upul Tharanga despite several warnings from the two onfield umpires simply couldnt up the Sri Lankan over rate and paid the penalty when the ICC slapped him with a two-match ban that affectively ended his participation in the tournament unless the team made it to the semi-finals.
Tharangas absence was another loss to Sri Lanka because he was one of the few batsmen who showed early form by scoring a half-century against South Africa. Thankfully for Sri Lanka their next match against India was five days after and that period allowed Mathews to recover from his injury and return to the team as captain. However Sri Lanka suffered another injury to a key player when Chamara Kapugedera was ruled out of the tournament with an injured knee he suffered while training.
Mathews return and his experience as a leader was clearly on show when Sri Lanka stunned the defending champions India by chasing down a competitive target of 322 to win by six wickets with eight balls to spare in their second match of the tournament from Group B.
India with their solid bowling attack looked home and dry after they posted 321-6, but Sri Lanka defied all odds to reach that total thanks largely to two young batters Kusal Mendis who once again rose to the big occasion to make a fluent 89 and Danushka Gunathilaka, the surprise packet as replacement for Kapugedera who forged a 159-run stand for the second wicket with Mendis to lay the foundation for Sri Lankas successful run chase. Left-hander Gunathilaka played some extraordinary strokes some of them reminiscent of the great Kumar Sangakkara to score a fine 76 off 72 balls. The irony of this pair was that they were both run out when they had the Indian bowling by the scruff of their neck and a century within their sights.
Nevertheless their contributions didnt go waste as Kusal Perera, Mathews and Asela Gunaratne carried Sri Lanka to a memorable win, much to the chagrin of the Indian players and their horde of supporters who were stunned into silence. However the win came at a cost for Sri Lanka. Kusal Perera suffered a hamstring injury while batting and had to retire hurt at 47 and later was ruled out of the tournament, thus forcing Sri Lanka to bring in a second replacement Dhananjaya de Silva for the crucial match against Pakistan. With all four teams in the group going into their final qualifying match with one win and one loss the contest virtually became a quarterfinal knockout with the winner going through to the semi-finals.
Having won and lost at the Oval in London, Sri Lanka travelled to Wales for their match against Pakistan at Cardiff. Put into bat first under overcast conditions Sri Lanka managed only 236, failing to last their full quota of overs by four balls. The odds were heavily on Pakistan to win chasing down such a moderate total and the result looked more assured when openers Azhar Ali and Fakhar Zaman posted 74 off 68 balls. At 92-1 Pakistan seemed well on course for a comfortable win and a place in the semi-finals. But a couple of bowling changes brought about by Mathews saw Sri Lanka come back strongly to capture five wickets for 45 and reduce Pakistan to 137-6. They were soon 162-7 when debutant Fahim Ashraf was run out. It was from this point onwards that things started to go awry for Sri Lanka. Within the next half hour they let the match slip out of their grasp as they put up a shoddy piece of fielding that anyone watching would have been ashamed to say that they were Sri Lankans.
Sarfraz Ahmed the Pakistan captain escaped two chances of being run out when the fielder failed to find the target after which he was put down twice  one, a dolly catch to mid-on and the other a difficult chance at deep square leg which the diving fielder lost control of. But these are catches that had to be taken at this level of cricket if you are vying for a semi-final berth in a tournament of this magnitude.
Seizing the opportunity with both hands and riding his luck Sarfraz with the help of Mohammad Amir who stuck it out for 43 balls to score a valuable 28 not out steered Pakistan to an unlikely victory from the jaws of defeat. Sarfraz who scored an unbeaten half century let out a roar as he made the winning hit - the roar could easily have come from the Lankan lion, but it was not to be their day.
Unable to hide the disappointment of Sri Lanka failing to make it to the semi-finals one irate fan wrote on Facebook, Winning against India was as good as winning the Champions Trophy.
One has to sympathise with Lasith Malinga who probably has played his last ICC tournament. He bowled his heart out for his country but was let down by poor fielding. Three catches were put down during the Pakistan innings all of Malinga. The veteran fast bowler couldnt hide his disappointment when Thisara Perera dropped a sitter at mid-on off Sarfraz. Had that catch been taken Malinga had only the Pakistan tail to deal with and he is quite good at finishing off an innings.
Apart from Malinga, the most improved Lankan bowler was Nuwan Pradeep who bowled with accuracy and movement and was the pick of the Lankan bowlers in the tournament. Suranga Lakmal another bowler who has improved over the years bowled exceptionally well but without luck.
Dinesh Chandimal had a rather lousy series not living upto his talent and failing once again to deliver. One hopes that he doesnt end up as Lahiru Thirimanne of whom there was a lot of expectations but one who has simply faded away for reasons best known to him. They were the two batsmen who were touted as the successors to Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara at one time, but have failed to live upto that belief.
In Niroshan Dickwella, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis and Kusal Perera, Sri Lanka has a young band of precocious batsmen to carry them through to the next decade or so with Mathews at the helm and Tharanga and Chandimal providing the experience to blend with the youth.
Everything is not lost for Sri Lanka with their exit from the Champions Trophy. The great thing is to learn from the mistakes and prepare themselves for the biggest event  the 2019 World Cup which will also be held in England. But before all that the most crucial area Sri Lanka has to concentrate on is making vast improvements in their fielding. Catches win matches is a familiar idiom connected to cricket. Sri Lanka found the true meaning of it at Cardiff.

Law enforcement authorities called to act
Violence, hate speech against religious and ethnic groups:
The Cabinet of Ministers directed the law enforcement authorities and the Attorney General to take action against instigators and perpetrators of violence and hate speech against religious and ethnic groups.
The Cabinet of Ministers issuing a statement yesterday said the National Unity Government, headed by President Maithripala Sirisena reaffirm commitment, in accordance with the mandates received at the Presidential election in January and Parliamentary election of August 2015, to ensure that the country never again returns to a conflict-ridden situation.
The statement adds: "The government resolves to guide the nation towards reconciliation, sustainable peace, and economic progress. Communal, ethnic and religious hatred and violence and impunity have no place in the society that we strive to build.
"We are concerned by the recent incidents of violence targeting places of religious worship, shops and business enterprises and houses. We denounce in the strongest terms, these acts of violence and hatred, including incidents of hate speech by certain individuals and groups aimed at inciting violence against the different ethnic and religious communities in the country.
"We are saddened by the destruction of property and loss of livelihoods as a result of recent incidents and the pain of mind and fear caused to individuals.
"We affirm that hate filled expressions and actions by individuals and groups with vested interests, resulting in demeaning, denigrating and inciting violence against fellow citizens of various ethnic, religious backgrounds have no place in Sri Lankan society.
"While reaffirming the governments commitment to reconciliation, peace building, peaceful co-existence and the rule of law, we direct the law enforcement authorities to take steps in accordance with the law of the land, against instigators and perpetrators of violence and hate speech targeting any religious and ethnic group in the country. The strictest action must be taken without delay, in accordance with the law, against persons or groups who act to incite violence and engage in acts of violence. The law must be applied to all regardless of social status, ethnic or religious background or political affiliations of perpetrators of such acts.
"We direct the law enforcement authorities and the Attorney General to expedite action against those responsible for atrocities committed, as impunity holds the possibility of the country receding into conflict.
"We express our deep appreciation to civil society and religious leaders who have stepped up to counter the attempts of a few to spread hate in the country, and who have called for calm and peaceful co-existence.
"We take this opportunity to urge the participation and leadership of Sri Lankans in efforts aimed at reconciliation and fostering peaceful co-existence in the country, without which, the stability and economic growth and progress that the nation deserves will continue to elude us.
"Gautama Buddhas teachings emphasise the importance of co-existence, tolerance, respect and compassion. This nation is blessed by the teachings of the four great religious traditions in the world  Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam  which provide us the guidance for peaceful co-existence, upholding human values and honest and hard work required to rebuild the nation as one of the most progressive in the region.
"We urge citizens, young and old, to contribute their best to the country as patriotic citizens to build a nation that is stable, peaceful and progressive; a society where the dignity of each individual is upheld; where diversity is respected; and where every individual has the opportunity to enjoy the freedoms that are the rights of equal citizenship.
"We must stand united to strive to eliminate the affliction of hatred towards each other, and resolve that we will never allow ourselves to once again be dragged into conflict as in the past."

Man arrested over defrauding Lankans in Italy
A Sri Lankan who allegedly defrauded several Sri Lankans employed in Italy had surreptitiously returned to the country without the knowledge of his clients, a report from Marawila said.
The suspect surrendered to the Marawila Police through a lawyer following complaints made to police by the relatives of the aggrieved clients.
A group of nearly 50 persons from Colombo, Negombo, Wennappuwa, Marawila and Thoduwawa were present at the Marawila Police station when he surrendered.
Shehan Curera, a resident of Negombo alleged that this suspect had defrauded him and his relatives by obtaining nearly Rs.500 million from them.
The suspect named Ariyan Fernando who had gained notoriety as Seettu Ari admitted to having obtained money from others.
He said he returned to the country because many people who obtained loans on interest from him had failed to return the money.
The suspect is said to have maintained an unofficial bank in Milano since 1996 which lent money on interest. He had also maintained Seettu with others and lent the money collected on interest. The suspect confessed that he could not give a time frame to return the money to his debtors, but intended to pay back his clients after selling a house owned by him and receives nearly Rs.100 million from the proceeds.Marawila Police are conducting investigations.

Several schools in the Matale town area have decided to close their student hostels temporarily due to a high incidence of dengue in the area. Intermittent rain in the area during recent weeks had caused a heavy increase in dengue mosquito larvae. Ukuwela, Dambulla and Galewela DS divisions and the Matale MC area have been identified as potential danger areas for the spread of dengue.
District Director of Health Services D M Wijekoon said cleaning up operations are underway in these areas to combat the spread of the disease. Cleaning operations are undertaken in state institutions on Fridays with the participation of employees on a shramadana basis.
Meanwhile, several parents complained that dengue eradication campaigns are neglected in most schools despite awareness programmes and this should gain the attention of education officials.

MG Group offers unmatched consultancy services in SL
While Sri Lanka remains strategically placed to benefit from the changing global marketplace, development of economic and social infrastructure is pivotal to unleashing our true potential.
With a distinct focus on bringing economic success, serving the increasing infrastructure requirements of our country, the MG Group of Companies (MGC), a dynamic trailblazer in the form of a network of independent companies has broken new ground.
MGC was established in 1998 as MG Consultants (Pvt) Ltd. When international consultancy firms dominated the infrastructure industry as the lead consultants and local counterparts only provided a limited range of support, MGC had a unique ability to drive fundamental change through its depth and breadth of expertise and experience which assisted the organization to break away from the shackles of international firms and traditional norms and be the first local consultancy firm to be recognized as the lead consultant for many projects.
MGC strengthened its ascent through the acquisition of the countrys pioneering engineering consultancy firm, Engineering Consultants (Pvt) Ltd. (ECL) in 2011.
ECL is endorsed as the most respected engineering services provider in the industry. Together they offer the widest and most varied range of consultancy services unmatched in Sri Lanka.
Infrastructure-related entities that compliment each other were added into the Group such as ECL Energy (Pvt) Ltd and Enterprise Technology (Pvt) Ltd (ETPL).
ECL Energy has carved a niche for itself in the renewable energy industry as a highly successful hydro power solution provider for both local and international projects while ETPL is a leading network systems integrator offering SMART ICT infrastructure solutions. Further expansion was witnessed through the amalgamation of Nimbus Venture (Pvt) Ltd, expanding the groups ability to provide smart IT platforms and cutting-edge technology for its clients.
Through these strategic acquisitions and having consistently outgrown boundaries MGG has grown into an international reputed brand. The Group serves the nation as Sri Lankas leading provider of end-to-end services for infrastructure development offering complete turnkey solutions to the infrastructure sector under one roof.
A truly integrated, multi-disciplinary organisation, MGG has diversified across a broad spectrum of sectors including transportation, built environments, education, health, urban development, water, irrigation, sewerage, environment and land, ICT, enterprise technology, renewable energy and property development.
With a global footprint spanning eight countries, a proven reputation locally and internationally for technical excellence and exceptional client satisfaction, to date MGG has completed 1,235 projects, valued at over US$ 1.8 billion.
As the group confidently looks forward to continued strong growth, it is now exploring the challenges and opportunities in executing a global expansion strategy and looking towards merges and acquisitions.
The group has vast experience in the transport sector, providing consultancy services for expressways, national and rural roads and has also been able to successfully conceptualize and execute several landmark end-to-end infrastructure projects and has revamped existing ones, delivering better efficiency and profitability.
A few of these include the Colombo South Harbour Container Terminal, the Epilepsy Hospital and Health Centres, Phase 4 Building of the Medical Faculty of Sri Jayawardanapura University, the Greater Kandy Water Supply Project and the Moratuwa-Ratmalana-Ja-ela Waste Water Disposal Project.

Most SL banks need to raise capital to meet Basel III - Fitch
Fitch estimates most Sri Lankan banks will need to raise capital to meet Basel III requirements by end 2018.
Sri Lankan banks will be moving to Basel III regulatory framework starting July 2017 and it will be fully implemented in early 2019, Jeewanthi Malagala, Analyst at CFA, said.
Capital buffers will be phased in up until January 1, 2019, she said, adding that no counter-cyclical buffer has been set.
Banks with assets more than Rs. 500 billion will be classified as D-SIBs.
Making a presentation on the Lankan banking sector, Malagala further noted that the Sri Lankan banking sector has witnessed rapid loan growth despite a contractionary monetary policy.
Loan growth in the sector has been high, exceeding banks internal capital generation.
State banks capacity to absorb losses is also overstated as their risk weighted assets are understated due to zero risk weights on pawning and foreign currency exposure to the state.
Noting that adjustment for stressed assets elevate the sector NPL ratio by about 1% , Malagala pointed out that the banking sector NPL growth has been masked by reduction in pawning NPLs  a trend not expected to continue.
Challenging operating conditions exert pressure on asset quality, particularly from segments such as retail and SMEs where banks have increasingly grown. NPL ratios of large Sri Lankan banks indicate an upward trend during 1Q17.
According to Malagala, state banks market share could also weaken in the medium term due to limited access to capital and substantial dividend payout.

MR trying to distort facts regarding GSP+ - Mangala
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said former President and Kurunegala district MP Mahinda Rajapaksa is trying to distort facts regarding the GSP+ concession.
The Minister responding to the comment made by the former President regarding the GSP+ concession, said that by saying that the Government should not create unrealistic expectations about GSP +
Rajapaksa is saying that obtaining GSP+ concession is trivial since Sri Lanka is very close to passing the threshold of an upper middle income country. A country has to be classified as upper middle income by the World Bank for three consecutive years in order to be no longer eligible for the GPS+ he said.
Even if Sri Lanka was to reach that threshold tomorrow, we would still have access to the advantaged of GSP+ for three years, and for one additional year after the decision is taken to withdraw the benefit, the Minister said.
Samaraweera said Rajapaksa cannot acknowledge that the Unity Government has managed to obtain a formidable boost to Sri Lankas economy, in application of Article 4(1) of the GSP+ regulation of 2012, for four years.

No audit done on debts raised from 2008 to 2015
AG says Central Bank did not disclose transaction details:
No audit has been conducted on Rs.4.7 trillion government debts raised from year 2008 to 2015, the Presidential Commission probing the Treasury Bond issue was told yesterday.
The said Rs. 4.7 trillion debts have been raised through direct placements issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, it was revealed as well. It was also observed that this Rs. 4.7 trillion worth transactions have taken place between 15 to 20 Primary Dealers and a few captive sources only.
The Commission questioned Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe as to why an audit was not conducted for seven years on the Rs. 4.7 trillion government debts raised or the method with which such a large amount of money was raised.
The Auditor General said the Central Bank did not disclose information regarding these transactions. He also explained that the money raised through Treasury bond issuance does not go into Central Banks accounts. The Auditor General has attempted to audit the Central Bank debt management since 2004, but their secret principles limited the audits, AG Wijesinghe said.
AG Wijesinghe said legal limitations were another reason for not being able to conduct an audit on the Rs. 4.7 billion. However, it was pointed out the Attorney General has provided a solid ground on which the Central Bank could have divulge secret or market sensitive information to the Auditor General.
Legal Counsel Harsha Fernando pointed out to the Commission that, the Attorney General has sent a letter in 2004 to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka requesting to disclose necessary information to the Auditor General for auditing purposes.
The Commission asked, does that mean the Central Bank has refrained from giving information to the AGs Department despite Attorney Generals order or whether it suggests that the AGs Department has not requested for those information since 2004 up until 2016, for auditing purposes.
Meanwhile, it was also pointed out to the Commission that, of the Rs. 4.7 trillion worth direct placements, only a 0.99% has been issued on the market rate. Closer to 45% of these direct placements have been issued below the market rate and 36% higher than the market rate, it was also pointed out.
This information is included in a report prepared by Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe responding to a request from former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
Legal Counsel Harsha Fernando led this evidence through the Auditor General H.M. Gamini Wijesinghe yesterday when he was testifying before the Commission for the third consecutive day.
Legal Counsel Harsha Fernando, the legal representative of the Deputy Governor P. Samarasiri pointed out to the Commission that, of the Rs. 4.7 trillion bonds, value of 19.24% bonds issued to the market are unaccounted.
He also pointed out that the Public Debt Department is only allowed to make changes to the market rate from 5 basis points higher or lower.
The Commission questioned Wijesinghe as to what kind of a methodology the AGs Department followed when preparing the report on the direct placements issued from 2008 to 2015.
Wijesinghe said the AGs Department requested the Central Bank to send information regarding the direct placements issued by the Central Bank and when the CBSL replied:We cut and pasted the information submitted by the CBSL to our report as it is.
The Commission asked Wijesinghe whether he means to say that the AGs Department did not scrutinise Central Banks documents when preparing this report regarding direct placements, to which the AG said they did not.
Commissioner, Supreme Court Judge, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena questioned Wijesinghe on a previous statement he made regarding the direct placement method.
On a previous occasion, replying to a question posed by the Commission, Wijesinghe said he holds the current officials of the Central Bank for continuing with the auction method without changing back to the direct placement method.
Based on this statement, Justice Jayawardena asked Wijesinghe whether he stands by his opinion that the direct placement method should remain, even after it is evident that this same method has paved way for many discrepancies.
Wijesinghe said the issue lies not in the direct placement method but in its application and administration. If the direct placement method is properly executed, it will be the method which can be utilised for the best interest of the government, Wijesinghe said.
The Auditor General is to testify before the Commission today as well.

One Belt One Road in practical terms
On May 14 and 15, The Belt and Road Forum (BRF) for International Cooperation was successfully held in Beijing. This international gathering brought together 29 heads of state and government, and 1,500 representatives from over 130 countries and 70 international organisations. The participation of Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his delegation fully showcased Sri Lankan Governments commitment for the Belt and Road initiative and the summit itself.
In the lovely season of early summer when every living thing was full of energy, distinguished guests and great minds gathered together, jointly pursuing BRI, a project of the century and made fruitful outcomes. Before and during the BRF, national governments, local authorities and enterprises reached a number of cooperation agreements, policy measures and practical results including 76 items comprised more than 270 concrete agreements in five key areas: policy, infrastructure, trade, financial and people-to-people connectivity.
Call of times
The world economy is undergoing profound changes, presenting both opportunities and challenges. The UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with the set of Sustainable Development Goals at its core provides a new blueprint of international cooperation.
Although various development strategies and connectivity cooperation initiatives from different countries have been put forward, still, the world economy is experiencing modest recovery with downside risks remaining. The growth of global trade and investment remains tempered, and the rules-based multilateral trading regime is yet to be strengthened. Huge funding gaps still trap the infrastructure construction worldwide.
All countries, especially developing ones, still face common challenges of eradicating poverty, promoting inclusive and sustained economic growth, and achieving sustainable development. How to explore new development paths and gain new growth momentum The world is anticipating a clearer action plan to answer the questions.
China should not be a bystander or a follower, but an active participant and a leader, making Chinas voice heard and inject more Chinese elements into the international rules, said President Xi Jinping. As Chinas economy and comprehensive national strength grow steadily, Chinas capacity and willingness to participate in the governance of global economy have been increasingly improved.
The international community has been arguing for a long time whether globalisation is the treasure cave found by Ali Baba or the Pandoras Box that gives out chaos.
President Xi Jinping has given Chinas answer to this question in the keynote speech at the 2017 World Economic Forum in Davos, and the BRF Forum in Beijing. Now Chinas voice has become the strongest support for economic globalisation. China raises BRI and supports the globalisation and developing countries growth in order to make the cake of the world economy bigger and drive countries, which deem peace and development as their priorities, to achieve their own development goals.
World connected
BRI stands for enhancing international cooperation including synergy of various development strategies, by building closer collaboration partnerships, which include advancing North-South, South-South, and triangular cooperation. Under the initiative, countries along the Belt and Road will strengthen the physical, institutional and people-to-people connectivity by promotion of industrial cooperation, scientific and technological innovation, and regional economic cooperation and integration so as to participate in the global value chain.
BRI endeavours to expand people-to-people exchanges, promote peace, justice, social cohesion, inclusiveness, democracy, good governance, the rule of law, human rights, gender equality and women empowerment; work together to fight against corruption and bribery in all their forms; to be more responsive to all the needs of those in vulnerable situations such as children, persons with disabilities and the old; and help improve global economic governance, and ensure equal access by all to development opportunities and benefits.
BRI encourages countries to manage the natural resources in an equitable and sustainable manner, conserve and sustainable use oceans and seas, freshwater resources, as well as forests, mountains and drylands, protecting biodiversity, ecosystems and wildlife, combating desertification, land degradation and climate change so as to achieve sustainable development in its three dimensions in a balanced and integrated manner.
Growth potential
BRI which is rooted in the history opens up to the future and aims at making all the participating countries gain from building it. BRI is the most important international public goods provided by China so far. The Initiative is Chinas idea, but the opportunities it creates belong to the world, said Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
There is a huge economic complementarity and great cooperation potential between China and Sri Lanka. Currently, Sri Lanka is striving to build itself as a financing and logistic centre in the Indian Ocean. Such development goal is in line with the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road in many aspects. China and Sri Lanka are able to synergize development strategies and jointly build the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road through dialogue and consultation.
During the pursuing of the common goal, China and Sri Lanka could improve the infrastructure facilities in Sri Lanka contributing to an international infrastructure network. Sri Lankas geographic location gives a promising future of shipping industry. Seizing the opportunity of development will improve Sri Lankas competitiveness in the international shipping market.
Building free trade zone and accelerating the consultation of the free trade agreement will benefit the people of both countries. The Sri Lankan Government has shown its enthusiasm to actively participate in global value chains development and supply chain. It is foreseeable that Sri Lankas basic industrial system will be greatly improved if the Hambantota logistic and industrial zone could be operated as early as possible.
Sri Lanka is planning to build an international financial city in Colombo. Our two countries can enhance financial infrastructure connectivity, jointly work on a long-term, stable and sustainable financing system. Bank of China has set up its South Asian Branch in Colombo. Moreover, Sri Lanka is able to make use of the Silk Road Fund, The China Development Bank, Exim Bank of China and Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank to enhance its financial capability.
China and Sri Lanka could deepen cooperation in environment protection, natural disaster management and counter climate change. No matter floods or drought, the Chinese Government and people will always stand together with the Sri Lankan people and offer timely assistance. Meanwhile, China is ready to assist Sri Lanka in construction a comprehensive nationwide disaster warning, management and response (WMR) system.
China and Sri Lanka both have long histories and bright civilisations. Both sides can strengthen dialogues between civilisation and cultural exchanges so as to promote tourism development and protect world cultural and natural heritages. Both countries can further encourage people-to-people exchanges and bonds by deepening practical cooperation on education, science, technology, sport, health, think-tank and media. Based on that, China granted more than 1,200 scholarships, training and internship to Sri Lanka every year since 2015.
BRI bases
China is one of the largest infrastructure construction partners and the main source of foreign investments in Sri Lanka. China-Sri Lanka economic and trade cooperation has created more than one hundred thousand job opportunities for the local people, trained tens of thousands of technicians and managers, and promoted the rapid development of various sectors.
Up to 2016, Chinese Companies in Sri Lanka has completed construction of infrastructure projects amounting to over USD 15.5 billion and made the direct investment over USD 2 billion contributing a lot to Sri Lankas economic growth and social development.
During the BRF Forum, President Xi Jinping announced that China will offer CNY400 million (Rs. 8.8 billion) as aid given gratis to Sri Lanka this year, and CNY 2 billion (Rs. 44 billion) for the period 2018-2020. China and Sri Lanka signed four important cooperation agreement including China-Sri Lanka economic and technical cooperation agreement, the Outline of the Medium and Long-Term Development Plan for Investment, Economic and Technological Cooperation, the Framework Agreement for the Promoting of Investment and Economic Cooperation, financing cooperation agreements. These agreements cover future key cooperation projects and areas.
President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe both expressed their willingness to actively participate into BRI and build Sri Lanka as the hub of Indian Ocean. Times keep moving forward, we are looking forward to working together with Sri Lanka and jointly create a brighter future. BRI is a long-term cooperation programme and needs efforts of generations. We are ready to cooperate with and assist Sri Lanka to carry out social and economic development. China always delivers promises.
Time has proved and will witness China as a friend indeed of Sri Lanka.

Cardiff: Pakistan booked their place in the Champions Trophy final with a crushing eight-wicket win over England in Cardiff on Wednesday.
Set just 212 to win, Pakistan finished on 215 for two.
Pakistan will now face title-holders India in Sundays final at the Oval if their arch-rivals beat Bangladesh in Thursdays second semi-final at Edgbaston.
Azhar Ali (76) and Fakhar Zaman (57) all but ended previously unbeaten tournament hosts Englands slim hopes of victory with an opening stand of 118.
But the real damage was done when England collapsed to 211 all out after Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed won the toss on a used pitch that played more like a sub-continental surface than a British one. Paceman Hasan Ali led a disciplined attack with a man-of-the-match return of three for 35 from his maximum 10 overs.
Credit goes to the bowlers and the batters who finished it very well, said Sarfraz at the presentation ceremony.
We adapted to conditions, we knew if we restrict them we could easily chase it down, he added.
Every game is a knockout game and I told my boys to play their game and not worry about the result.
Defeat extended Englands long wait for a maiden major one-day international title until at least 2019 -- when they stage the next World Cup.
One thing we didnt do was adapt to conditions, which I thought Pakistan did extremely well, said England captain Eoin Morgan.
We did prepare for a used wicket but 211 wasnt a good score. 250/270 would have been.
He added: The fact weve produced brilliant performances in this tournament and then play like that on this wicket is extremely disappointing.
Pakistans openers compounded Englands misery to the delight of their supporters at a sun-drenched Cardiff. Left-hander Fakhar hit a six -- something England didnt manage in their entire innings -- when a top-edge off fast bowler Mark Wood flew safe.
The dashing Fakhar completed a 49-ball fifty to follow his 50 against Sri Lanka. Azhar, who pulled all-rounder Ben Stokes for six, followed him to the landmark in 68 balls.
On a Cardiff ground where they chased more than 300 to beat England in an ODI last year, Pakistan completed Wednesdays pursuit with a mammoth 77 balls to spare when Mohammad Hafeez pulled Stokes for four.
England did avoid a 10-wicket defeat when Jos Buttler stumped Fakhar off leg-spinner Adil Rashid and Azhar too fell before the finish, pulling Jake Ball into his stumps. Pakistan, however, had the game all but won at 173 for two. India thrashed Pakistan by 124 runs in the teams Champions Trophy tournament opener at Edgbaston on June 4. But three days later Pakistan returned to the Birmingham ground to make a mockery of the rankings by beating South Africa in a bottom versus top clash.
Pakistan then held their nerve in a three-wicket win over Sri Lanka in Cardiff on Monday -- a virtual quarter-final for both sides. England didnt manage a single individual fifty in their innings. Joe Root top-scored with 46 and Yorkshire team-mate Jonny Bairstow, recalled in place of dropped opener Jason Roy, managed 43. Rumman Raees, in for injured fellow left-arm quick Mohammad Amir, took two for 44 on his ODI debut.
England, who were 128 for two, lost their last eight wickets for just 83 runs. Bairstow replaced Roy after the Surrey opener had managed just 51 runs in eight ODI innings this season.
Dropped twice, Bairstows luck ran out when a misjudged pull off Hasan sailed gently to Hafeez at deep square leg.
Root fell when well set after an edged cut off leg-spinner Shadab Khan was well held by wicket-keeper Sarfraz.
Morgan, who made 87 in a 40-run win against Australia last time out, fell for 19 when he charged down the pitch to Hasan and edged behind.
Stokes, fresh from his career-best 102 not out against Australia, took 64 balls to score a 34 that, remarkably for the usually big-hitting all-rounder, did not include a single boundary.
He eventually holed out to cover when deceived by Hasans slower ball.
Pakistan belied their reputation as a poor fielding side, with Fakhar holding a brilliant diving catch at deep square leg to dismiss Moeen Ali, while substitute Ahmed Shehzad ran out Rashid with a direct hit.
Sarfraz rescued Pakistan with an unbeaten 61 after they collapsed against Sri Lanka but, two days on, there was no repeat of that batting slump. AFP

The Pethara irrigation anicut is in a state of disrepair.
The Thihagoda-Godamaga junction in Welletota via Malimbada main highway lies on this anicut.
According to motorists, the stretch of the highway at the junction is not even 10 feet wide and motorists find it difficult to drive heavy and long vehicles through it. This irrigation anicut was built over 60 to 70 years ago, across the Kiramba Oya, which is one of the main tributaries of the Nilwala river. The hairpin bend off this anicut is also a dangerous road block. Several accidents have occurred, residents said. The handrails of the anicut are broken down as well. To avoid further road accidents, residents urge the SPC road development authorities to construct a permanent bridge at this point of the road for the convenience of motorists and pedestrians. This is the only short route to the Godagama interchange of the southern expressway for commuters from down South, pedestrians said.

Police ask insurance firms for accident claims details
The Sri Lanka Police has decided to call reports from Insurance companies who pay one the spot claims on motor accidents.
SP, Indika Hapugoda, Director Traffic Police said that some accidents that are settled by insurance companies without the mediation of the Police create a situation where traffic planning to the future is not possible. We cant maintain records and now we will inform Insurance companies to send us accounts of the accidents in the future, he said.
We also observe that drink driving, motor bike and three wheels to be the main contributor for these accidents.
There is dip in drink driving accidents after the fines were increased to Rs. 25, 000.
Speaking at the Dont Hit and Run campaign launched by Automobile Association he said that they police expected the fatal motor accidents reports last year (2,590) to double this year. Sadly Sri Lanka has already registered over 2,000 fatal accidents this year.
He also disclosed that last year Sri Lanka Police collected over RS. 2,239 million as traffic spot fines and court fines. This also included RS. 1,496 million collected form spot fines. In the first quarter of this year we have collected RS. 472 million from traffic fines, he said.
By the end of 2015, Sri Lanka recorded the highest death toll (2,801) due to the massive number of road accidents. Among the numbers of concern was the total number of fatal accidents (2,590) excluding the death toll mentioned prior.
Some of these statistics mentioned are due to the negligence of drivers when committing a criminal offense, leaving the victims stranded.

Our main objective is to reduce the death toll by a minimum of 30% and total disability due to Hit & Run by a minimum of 50% within two years. The Dont Hit & Run! project is to be implemented with grants from the Federation Internationale de IAutomobile (FIA) and contributions from sponsors. Creating awareness on how to prevent deaths and permanent disabilities due to Hit and Run after an accident could reduce the death rate considerably, said Dhammika Attygalle, President of AA Ceylon.
In addition, AA Ceylon will display messages on the repercussions of Hit & Run together with Boy scouts and volunteers to create awareness.

Proposed US$ 2 bn Colombo-Katunayake Rail Project gets on track
High Speed Railway Corporation Pvt Ltd (HSRC) achieved a milestone recently when its equity partner Castlepines Global EquitiesJapan Office (CGE) signed a mandate to partner in delivering what is expected to be one of Sri Lankas largest mega transport projects.
Dr. Parimalam Rajo Isa Michael, the founding Chairman and visionary leader of the High-Speed Rail and Mixed Development Project, was the prime mover in setting up this partnership with one of the worlds largest equity funding partners, Castlepines Global Equities.
HSRC with CGE have jointly extended a mandate to the Korean Institute of Machinery & Materials (KIMM) who have pioneered the MagLev technology into an urbanized version that has been successfully implemented in Korea with efficiency and economic value for both the operator and passenger.
KIMM will be mandated to undertake the design, development and implementation of the technology in Sri Lanka, while also taking on the responsibility to train and technically equip local knowhow for the future. This would be the first such instance in the entire Asian region.
CML-MTD Construction Ltd., which is part of MTD Walkers PLC of Sri Lanka and their global counterparts Alloy MTD (based in Malaysia), will be mandated to undertake the construction of the proposed rail project estimated to cost around US$2 billion at this stage.
Ceylan Insurance Brokers Pvt Ltd., have been mandated as the exclusive insurance partners of the mega project.
The proposed mega project constitutes a state-of-the-art railway line that will use magnetic levitation (MagLev) to cover Negombo, Katunayake (Bandaranaike International Airport  BIA), Bopitiya, Ragama, Kettarama International Cricket Stadium, Beira Lake (Colombo Fort), Port City and Colombo 03 (Kollupitiya) Railway Station.
A new concept into township development will cater to a minimum of 3,200 dwellings, both isolated and structured, with facilities and features such as modern amenities, car parks, fully-equipped sports complex, an 18-hole golf resort, water park, flora and fauna nature reserve theme park and many more facilities.
The promoters of this project led by Dr. Michael have emphasized the importance of the nature preservation requirements to the consortium, which has unanimously consented to this decision and hence carefully taken into account the legislated environmental policies and guidelines in preparing for the project.
A 300-bed, fully-equipped hospital combined with state-of-the-art laboratories, lodging and reference library is being designed (Ragama Health City) to ensure that every medical need of Sri Lanka and the South Asian region as a whole can be made available at an attractive and competitive rate.
The proposed terminal is expected to encourage and afford an opportunity to sports enthusiasts to directly access the line to catch up on cricket at Kettarama International Stadium.
A 400-room, star-class hotel (Beira Lake Colombo Fort) has been planned to ensure that the best of everything is made available to both business travelers and holiday-makers.
The train terminal is proposed at this location as an underground terminal which will allow passengers using the facility to alight at this destination and simply walk into the hotel.
The Port City Terminal has been primarily planned to ensure access to the proposed financial hub of Sri Lanka with the best and most convenient source of transport.
Colombo 3 (Kollupitiya) Terminal will be the final destination of Phase I of this initiative. The project also intends to link the existing train lines from Colombo 3 railway station.
This is a landmark event for me and the country, said Dr. Michael.
While there are many opportunities within the Asian region to invest in growth, it was our personal decision to support Sri Lanka, said Takashi Kinoshita, President, Castlepines Global EquitiesJapan Office.

Sangakkaras 100th century sets up Surrey semi-final berth
LONDON, Tuesday: Kumar Sangakkaras 100th career century helped Surrey beat Yorkshire by 24 runs to reach the One-Day Cup semi-finals.
The Sri Lankans brilliant run-a-ball 121, in a fourth-wicket stand of 180 with Ben Foakes (86), helped the visitors to 313-7 at Headingley.
Opener Adam Lyth struck 75 and Australia batsman Peter Handscomb made 60 but Yorkshire fell short on 289-9.
Surrey play Worcestershire at New Road in the last four on Saturday, with the final at Lords on 1 July.
Essex host Nottinghamshire in the other semi-final on Friday.
Sangakkara, who is retiring from first-class cricket at the end of this season, looked in superb touch once again, offering only one difficult chance to Alex Lees on the boundary early on in his innings.
The 39-year-old mixed deft touches to the boundary with some brutal straight hitting over the rope to bring up his 39th List A century.
When he was eventually stumped off Azeem Rafiq and Foakes fell to the same bowler soon after, teenagers Ollie Pope (37) and Sam Curran (19) made sure Surrey passed 300.
In the chase, Yorkshire were well placed with Lyth and Jack Leaning (42) taking them to 126-1 at the halfway stage.
But once Lyth gifted a catch to Mark Stoneman on the cover boundary off seamer Ravi Rampaul and Leaning nicked Rampaul behind in his next over, Yorkshire began to struggle.
Skipper Gary Ballance (36) added 64 with Handscomb but could not push on, and only a late flurry of boundaries from Matthew Waite in his 34 prevented an even bigger winning margin for Surrey.

Shelter for all by 2025 under the Yahapalanaya regime
Out of a total of 6 million families in Sri Lanka, 2.5 million families have various housing issues while the Yahapalanaya regime succeeded in fulfilling the housing needs of 220,636 families during a period of two years, Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
The Minister said that the Housing and Construction Ministry and other affiliated organisations would execute the ultimate goal of providing a shelter to every citizen by 2025.
Speaking at a media briefing at the Sirikotha, United National Party Headquarters yesterday, he said the previous regime was very inefficient and wasted the countrys funds on unfruitful projects without even satisfying the basic needs of the general public. The previous Government neglected to maintain an accurate set of statistics on the housing issues and needs of the country and they were manipulating the statistics according to their own will, the minister added.
Premadasa said the Housing and Constructions Ministry had carried out a census on the housing needs of the country and it would be released on June 23, on the National Housing Day under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
He said, According to the census, it was identified that 3,650 families of war heroes do not have a permanent shelter. The previous regime was only focused on implementing unproductive projects such as establishing the Hambanthota port and the airport without giving priority to the war heroes who fought against terrorism to achieve freedom. The Yahapalanaya regime will satisfy the housing needs of the 3,650 war heroes families by 2020.
Premadasa further said that 511,000 families had been identified with no access to clean water and 200,000 families are identified to be having serious issues with sanitary facilities while over 278,000 families had been residing in temporary shelters and over 300,000 people had been identified with no proper shelter, according to the census.
The Minister said that construction of 420 Uda Gammana Model Villages were in progress and the present regime would execute it with the aim of constructing 500 Uda Gammana Model Villages by the end of 2017. The ultimate goal of the Government will be to construct 2,000 model villages by 2020 to satisfy the housing needs of the general public, he added.
Premadasa also said that several housing projects including the Scattered Housing programme, Northern Housing Project, Housing programme for kidney patients, Special Housing Programme in Bogaswewa and Batticaloa, Grama Shakthi Programme, Housing programme for youth between the ages of 18 and 35 and Housing programme for artists at regional level had been implemented and would be executed by the Yahapalanaya regime.
A housing programme for journalists will also be implemented jointly with the aid of the Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake," he added.
The Minister further said that housing programmes for mid income earners had been implemented in Wadduwa, Ragama, Athurugiriya and Homagama.

SriLankan has recruited 1250 from 2015 without Ministers knowledge
Co-cabinet spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday revealed that 1250 employees had been recruited to Sri Lankan Airlines during the past two and a half years without the knowledge of the Minister in charge.
Issues within the national carrier have further exacerbated in recent times with the airline continuing to face losses accumulating to Rs 22 billion.
Cabinet which discussed the dismal failure of the airline had the President deciding to summon the director board of SriLankan Airlines at the next Cabinet meeting to discuss problems within SriLankan.
I will also be attending this meeting, the President said any minister interested could come for it, Senaratne said.
Minister Kabir Hashim said that he was not aware of what was happening within the airline and that none of his directives have been implemented. We cannot have governments within governments, the Health Minister said.
He also alleged that many of the appointees at the top were those appointed by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and that they were still running things within the national carrier. In 2015, the government appointed Ajith Dias as the Chairman of SriLankan Airlines, replacing Nishantha Wickramasinghe; brother-in-law of Kurunegala MP Mahinda Rajapaksa. The very same year they also appoint Captain Suren Ratwatte as its CEO.

State media should build ethical media culture: President
State media should take the lead in building an ethical, disciplined and quality media culture in the country, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was speaking after opening a new administrative building complex of the Independent Television Network (ITN) yesterday to mark the 38th anniversary celebrations of the ITN.
The President said the time he contested the Presidential election as the common candidate could be described as the period in which the state media was misused in a most degrading and uncivilised manner in the countrys history. The unfounded allegations levelled at him during the period had not been faced by any other politician or Presidential candidate in the country. Instead of gaining maturity with age, the state media suffered decline two and a half years ago, he said.
Such a lowly media culture should not emerge in the country in the future, the President said.
He said such insults were levelled against him because he was a member of a poor family, who posed a challenge to those who considered them as mighty individuals.
President Sirisena said he did not become President to bring his family members to politics, but to perform his duty and responsibility towards the country and its people by overcoming challenges.
A good political culture could be fostered only through a good media movement. Media heads, managements as well as media persons should dedicate themselves to fulfil duties and responsibilities of an independent and free media.
President Sirisena signed the visitors book at the ITN media network
The President also opened a museum containing items of archaeological value belonging to the ITN.
The Maha Sangha led by Most Ven. Ittepane Dhammalankara Mahanayake Thera, clergy of other religious denominations, Ministers Mangala Samaraweera and Gayantha Karunatilleke, Finance Ministry Secretary R. H. S.

Structuring spaces
The profession of Architecture is commonly perceived to be related to the creation of exciting spaces and inspiring forms with the architect being trained in the art of dealing with space and form. ArchWorld speaks to Archt. Dr. Senaka Dharmatilleke who deeply elaborates on the broader strategic role of the Architect in dealing with socio-political and economic issues of a society. Dharmatilleke, a deep thinker, reflects upon how the professional expertise of the architect could contribute to national development at a broader level, in mega scale restructuring schemes of the urban space.
"The architect's ability in "structuring space" to facilitate a specific function or a behavioural pattern is the key to the articulation of space and form. Spatially designating the locations of functional areas and optimising the circulation and movement patterns of human traffic or logistics is an inherent part of architectural design. Thus, macro level urban developments in most developed countries have harnessed such skills of the architects in dealing with their "geo-spatial" endeavours that need - quantitative measures related to functionality and qualitative measures related to human life and communal spirit," said Dharmatilleke.
In the wake of a state driven movement for the development of a Mega-polis and global initiatives to ensure sustainability in the built environment through "Urban Sustainability", the architect's role may now be redefined.
"In such a context, the architects may use their professional capabilities to deal with a grand scheme of national level that adopts a "geo-spatial approach" for socio-economic development while ensuring a sustainable growth of the nation's built environment," stated Dharmatilleke
Mega-polis
Dharmatilleke explained the term 'Mega-polis'.
"Based on the definition advanced by academics, a mega-polis is a densely populated large spatial entity created by the consolidation of a complex network of adjacent or overlapping metropolitan areas. Further, the theory of Ekistics proposed by Doxiadis (The Greek Architect / Town Planner who introduced the term 'mega-polis') explores how such intensification of scale and density of urban entities can activate synergies in - coordinated industrial production, economic prosperity and social development; if strategically managed and synchronized," added Dharmatilleke
FacultyofGraduate Studiesat KDU
He observes that although this particular term is not used and the proposed intensities are not practiced, countries such as Singapore have reaped the benefits of strategic spatial structuring played upon a nation-wide canvas, in which Architects and Urban Designers have played a key role.
"In such endeavours they have achieved "functional efficiency" of human activity and feasible distribution of infrastructure while addressing quantitative and qualitative demands of habitation," pointed out Dharmatilleke
Architects can positively contribute to mega scale urban restructuring while addressing all three tenants of "Urban Sustainability" such as - Economic sustainability, Social sustainability and Environmental sustainability.
"A broader urban structuring could ensure that essential functional relationships needed for strong economic growth are facilitated by the strategic manipulation of physical space. In such a grand scheme, the location of industries and production centres will ensure easy access to raw material and resources while finished products could be easily dispatched to ports, airports and internal distribution centres," said Dharmatilleke
The availability of skilled manpower resources within close reach to function such production bases will be another consideration for locating particular industries in terms of demographic distribution of the working populations.
"Also to activate synergies between industrial production and education, industry-based research and development facilities will be spatially linked with institutions of higher education and vocational training.
In coordinating all the above in a space based matrix, a comprehensive network of transportation will be overlapped and synchronized with particular needs of industrial production and human transportation. Similar considerations will come into play in terms of agricultural production if such a scheme is extended into a nationwide scheme to ensure Economic Sustainability," added Dharmatilleke
Social Sustainability
Dharmatilleke elaborated on "Social Sustainability" and explains how it could be connected to the process of 'industrial production' related to economic sustainability.
"The residential enclaves of the human resources that provide manpower for the previously noted factories would be also synchronized spatially to ensure transportation needs of the working population between their homes and workplaces. This spatial synchronisation should also serve their dependents in terms of schooling, shopping, obtaining medical facilities, recreation," said Dharmatilleke
With such synchronization of economic production with the provision of social infrastructure and the generation of employment, the aspect of social sustainability can be addressed effectively.
"Space based strategies could ensure social equity, social justice and inclusion through the strategic provision of public spaces. Space based strategies related to micro scale zoning may facilitate greater distribution of wealth by providing opportunities for retail and other financial ventures of different scales and intensities to be accommodated in favourable locations. Also this space based drive for social equity could be pursued in terms of generating affordable housing for a multiplicity of socio-economic groups in a coordinated spatial matrix. Further, qualitative aspects such as the preservation of cultural heritage, identity and creating a sense of place that would nurture a sense of belonging for varied social groups would be addressed if such a grand scheme is conducted in a comprehensive space based approach," clarified Dharmatilleke
Environmental Sustainability
Finally, Dharmatilleke focuses on 'Environmental Sustainability'.
"In a space based mega-exercise, which spatially synchronises industrial production and human habitation, the professionals who spearhead this movement would be in a perfect position to ensure the environmental sustainability of the total scheme. The main tenants of the term environmental sustainability can be viewed as - the "prevention of resource depletion" and the "prevention of environmental pollution". Such a nationwide development scheme would have sufficient scale to comprehensively manipulate aspects such as - the spatial distribution of the generating sources of waste / emissions as and their disposal systems, the type of energy used for production in terms of their renewability and pollution levels, and the sources where water and mineral resources are tapped and their quantities.
Thus, it could engage professionals who are trained to mitigate such ill-effects by formulating and implementing "Development Controls" in terms of "Planning and Building Regulations" while also evaluating development proposals.
Thus, such regulations would not be negative rules that hinder physical development but positive guidelines that would enhance the environmental quality and also facilitate further development at subsequent stages," summed up Dharmatilleke.

Taiwan offers e-visas for Lankan businessmen
In an effort to further deepen economic ties between Taiwan and Sri Lanka, Taiwan has streamlined the visa process for Sri Lankan travelers under its New Southbound Policy, the centerpiece of Taiwans international trade strategy.
Accordingly, e-visa applications have been made available for business travelers recommended by Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), branch offices starting from June. Tourist visas will also be open for applications, TAITRA President and CEO Walter Yeh said.
He was speaking at the Sri Lanka Taiwan Business Forum, held in Colombo yesterday. TAITRA organized a trade mission to Sri Lanka and held business events to promote partnerships in the IT, machinery, energy, textile, construction and many other sectors.
Yeh further noted that Taiwan is eyeing to further develop cooperation in information technology, agriculture, Smart city, green industries and tourism sectors in Sri Lanka.
In addition, TAITRA inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka (FCCISL) in Taipei in April, 2017 to take the existing partnership between the two organizations into a new era and enable both parties to explore new ways to strengthen their trade promoting work and further Sri Lanka-Taiwan trade.
FCCISL plays a leading role in promoting and enhancing the businesses and industries of Sri Lanka. TAITRA and FCCISL first signed a MoU back in 1995.
According to Yeh, Sri Lanka is on the right path to higher growth and there is great potential for Sri Lanka-Taiwan business and industrial cooperation. He further added that improving Sri Lankan business environment and sound legal system will support greater foreign investments in the future.

Thisaras missed catch was not the reason for our defeat - Malinga
Sri Lankas pace ace Lasith Malinga commenting on the drop catch debate of Sri Lankas defeat to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy on Monday said that he is not frustrated or disappointed by two catches missed off his bowling.
Speaking during a press conference at SLC headquarters after they arrived from England yesterday, Malinga said: I dont blame anyone for I know these kinds of things can happen when you play under so much pressure. I do not believe Thisaras drop catch is the reason for our defeat and honestly I dont blame Thisara for the mistake he made. That is all part of the game.
Sarfraz Ahmed the Pakistan captain was missed twice by Thisara Perera and by substitute fielder Seekkuge Prasanna. Making capital of those missed opportunities Sarfraz went onto steer Pakistan to a three wickets win and a place in the semi-finals. Malinga also mentioned that the fielders are often subject to criticism when they make mistakes, but rarely admired their great contributions on the field. They deserve a proper recognition too, Malinga added.
Captain Angelo Mathews accepted that the whole team is responsible for the loss. We had a fairly good start but were unable to maintain consistency in batting. On the bright side I think it was a fantastic effort as a team against strong India. It is good to see our young players getting good scores and fighting bravely, said Mathews.
We missed a few chances but thats how the game goes. We must learn from our mistakes and move forward.
Sri Lanka was eliminated from the Champions Trophy group stage when they lost their final match to Pakistan by three wickets.

Together were cutting climate and disaster risks
Its a simple fact that as we continue to pump record levels of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere we are ramping up disaster risk around the globe now and for generations to come.
It goes with the sobering reality of warming and rising seas and widespread changes in the
Earths systems that are influencing storms, winds and rainfall.
The toll this takes on human life, economies and government expenditures will be high on the agenda when world leaders gather in Mexico for the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction in late May.
Latest figures show that disasters  90% of which are classed as climate related  now cost the world economy US$520 billion per year and push 26 million people into poverty every year.
In the 22 years that have passed since COP1, the first UN conference on climate change, we have seen greenhouse gas emissions reach critically high levels which bodes ill for those who already live in dry lands, on cyclone-exposed coastlines, flood plains, below unstable hillsides or in parts of the world dependent on glacier meltwater.
Climate related disasters
Over that time span we have also seen a doubling of weather and climate related disasters, which can further weaken least developed countries like Haiti which lost over 600 lives and around a third of its GDP when it was struck by Hurricane Matthew last October.
By some recent estimates the bill for Haitis recovery from that Category 4 hurricane comes to US$2.8 billion, an extraordinary sum for a country where 60% of the population live in dire poverty.
The Philippines lost thousands of its citizens partly due to the slow passage of Typhoon Haiyan across the warming, rising waters of the Pacific Ocean in 2013. And again, the economic losses and the cost of building back better ran into billions.
Meanwhile the drylands of the Sahel and southern Africa already at high risk from rising temperatures, breached the limits of their capacity to sustain human life adequately in the last twelve months as country after country declared a state of national emergency and millions suffered the devastation of hunger and the loss of their livelihoods.
Just five years after the first famine of the 21st century was declared over, Somalia is again on the brink underlining the fact that 80% of the worlds hungry live in countries which are heavily prone to hydro-meteorological disasters.
Rapid and unplanned urbanisation
Climate change, aggravated by phenomena like El Nio, is not the only driver of disaster risk but it is the joker in the pack as the world tries to understand how it combines with other key risk factors such as poor risk governance, rapid and unplanned urbanisation, poverty and environmental degradation.
Much of this understanding and better planning needs to be done now and at the local level. Adopting the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction two years ago, UN Member States agreed to substantially increase the number of national and local disaster risk reduction strategies in place by 2020.
These strategies will be the bedrock for decreasing disaster losses by 2030 through reducing mortality, economic losses and damage to critical infrastructure.
It is imperative that we break down any silos that exist between the exponents of disaster risk reduction whose remit extends beyond climate-related hazards, and those whose focus is on climate action.
As these national and local plans are put in place there is an opportunity to ensure joined up action across the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda including the Paris Climate Change Agreement, and an obligation also to avoid duplication of effort.
Sustainable Development Goals
The achievement of many of the Sustainable Development Goals including those related to poverty, hunger, climate action, sanitation and clean water depend on this. Both of us recognise that reducing greenhouse gas emissions and keeping global temperature well below 2 degrees C is the greatest long-term contribution that governments, local governments and the private sector can make to disaster risk reduction.
Meanwhile local planning for improved disaster risk management helps create a grass-roots, societal demand for action and ever rising ambition nationally and globally for climate action above and beyond existing pledges.
The outcome of this fifth Global Platform has the potential to bring the worlds of disaster risk and climate risk closer together and that can only be a good thing for resilience; people everywhere and the future stability of our world.
While it is the poor and the vulnerable who are in the firing line now, no country or continent will be immune if we dont take responsibility and seize the opportunity to act today.

Trump-Russia inquiry: President's 'possible obstruction to be probed'

US President Donald Trump is being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller for possible obstruction of justice,the Washington Post reports.
Citing unnamed officials, the newspaper says three senior intelligence officials have agreed to be interviewed by Mueller's investigators.
Trump's lawyer said the FBI's leak to the newspaper was "outrageous".
Mueller is overseeing an FBI inquiry into Russia's alleged meddling the 2016 US election and any Trump links to it.
President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia, describing the ongoing inquiry as a "witch hunt".
On Wednesday, the Washington Post described the decision by Mueller to investigate President Trump's own conduct as a major turning point in the investigation, which until recently focused on the Russian angle.
Quoting the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, the newspaper said Daniel Coats, the director of national intelligence, Mike Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency, and Richard Ledgett, until recently Rogers' deputy, agreed to be interviewed by investigators.
The newspaper said this could happen as early as this week.
The unnamed officials told the newspaper the obstruction of justice investigation began just days after President Trump fired former FBI director James Comey on 9 May.
Before the sacking, Trump had sought and received assurances from Comey that he personally was not under investigation.
However, Comey has since suggested that Trump attempted to get him to shut down the investigation into his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.
Flynn was fired in February for failing to reveal the extent of his contacts with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to Washington.
The White House has denied it put pressure on Comey.
James Comey hinted at it. Washington insiders suspected it. Now the Washington Post is reporting it (through anonymous sources, of course).
Donald Trump himself is under direct investigation for obstruction of justice by the special counsel's office.
Take all those previous assertions by the president that he's not the target of law enforcement efforts, and throw them out the window.
Trump will surely insist that the inquiry into whether his campaign had ties to Russia is still a hoax perpetrated by Democrats and a hostile media, and that the obstruction allegations are built on that empty foundation.
That may not matter. "It's not the crime; it's the cover-up," may be a hackneyed political saying, but that doesn't mean it lacks a kernel of truth.
There's still an open question as to what, exactly, could happen if Mueller does find the president violated the law in acting to disrupt an ongoing investigation.
Could charges be filed Would it fall on the House of Representatives to act
It's all uncharted legal terrain.
If the Washington Post is correct, however, Mueller may be charting a course for the darkness.
President Trump has so far made no comments on the latest report.
But a spokesman for Trump's lawyer Marc Kasowitz responded angrily to the Washington Post story.
"The FBI leak of information regarding the president is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal," said spokesman Mark Corallo.

He was opening the 378th branch of Sathosa at Kokkadichcholai in the farming and underprivileged area of Paddipalai Secretarial Division of the western sector of Batticaloa, recently.
The ceremony was presided by Paddiruppu electorate organizer S. Ganeshamoorthy. He said the price of sugar has been increased by only Rs. 10. Therefore, traders cannot increase the price arbitrarily. A team of 200 inspectors has been deployed to check on this, he said.
Before the end of this year, 500 branches of Sathosa will open island-wide. The western sector of Batticaloa has been privileged to have one government commercial institution, Ganeshamoorthy said.

UNPers have a case
UNP grassroots supporters are a hugely disgruntled lot these days. It is the constant lament by party back benchers in parliament that their members have been left in the lurch following the tie up with the SLFP in the formation of the Unity Government. This step-motherly treatment is most glaring in the area of job allocation, they claim. UNP MPs, particularly in the south, are the most aggrieved in this connection. Many are the southern based MPs who have brought this matter to the fore, both in parliament and TV debates. They insist that it is the SLFP ministers who maintain a monopoly on jobs , while the UNP supporters were being overlooked. The latest to air his grievance in public was Habaraduwa UNP Chief Organiser Chandralal Abeygunawardena.
Addressing a Janahamuwa in his electorate on Tuesday he said UNPers who had manned polling booths for the last 22 years (when the party was in the Opposition) were still without jobs and five of his supporters who were assaulted during the last Presidential election were languishing at home. Rubbing it in, he said that the six persons who carried out the assault had found employment at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, in a clear reference to the patronage extended by his SLFP rival of the same electorate who was the Minister under whose purview the CPC came until the changes effected during the recent Cabinet reshuffle. The UNPer warned that if this state of affairs were to continue a massive explosion in the Grand Old Party could not be avoided.
Many UNPers, including ministers, no doubt would empathise with Abeygunawardena, who as grassroots politicians have to look into the interests of their party supporters. But from what has transpired over the past two and half years UNP supporters have been given the cold shoulder in the dispensing of jobs in the state sector, particularly in institutions coming under Ministries such as Transport, Petroleum Resources and Power and Energy, all job providing milch cows, which are manned by SLFP Ministers (Even Ports is now in the hands of a SLFP Minister).
Adding to the woes of the UNP grassroots organsiers is the fact that all Provincial Council (barring the North and East) are in the hands of the SLFP, with Local Councils now functioning under Special Commissioners, which anyway, are today filled to the brim with Rajapaksa supporters, thus cutting off any prospective employment opportunities for UNP grassroots supporters in these bodies as well.
The grouse of the UNP supporters is all the more telling given that it was the party grassroots machinery which put its shoulder to the wheel in ensuring that the Common Candidate prevailed on January 8 with many party workmen subject to assault as highlighted by the Habaraduwa party organiser. On the other hand what may be rankling to likes of Abeygunawardena and other UNP grassroots organsiers is the scenario where the SLFP Ministers who now continue to dispense largesse to their supporters are the very people who were firmly behind Mahinda Rajapaksa at both the Presidential and parliamentary elections and those enjoying their patronage were the very ones who did everything to wreck the chances of the Common Candidate at the polls attacking UNP supporters and even setting fire to the stages of the CC.
Be that as it may, it is time UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe took stock of the situation and apply remedial measures before things deteriorate further leading to an implosion within the party, that could cause irreversible damage. To begin with, it is the UNP which enjoys the majority in the House and it could well have gone its own way in forming it's own government as happened both in 1994 and 2001 with the support of other parties (or by inveigling some SLFPers into its fold). In such an event there would not have been the present unrest within the ranks of the UNP supporters who would have been ladled with the gravy, with the government comprising an exclusive UNP led Cabinet.
True, by taking steps to form a Unity Government the Premier, while ensuring stability in the regime, also succeeded in preventing a massive backlash by UNP supporters who had been languishing in the Opposition for two decades, against their SLFP counterparts, as as been the trend in this country with regime changes. But it is now time to address the grievances of the UNP supporters who made so much sacrifices and deprived of employment opportunities all those years.
The present arrangement in governance cannot continue forever. One day there would necessarily have to be a parting of ways. Already, members of both the UNP and the SLFP are talking of forming their own governments in the not too distant future. From the looks of things the SLFP has already gained a head start in this regard by keeping its supporters happy with the provision of jobs. The UNP too should think ahead likewise to the day when it will have to form a government of its own.

Visa supports flood relief efforts in Sri Lanka
In response to the devastating floods in Sri Lanka, Visa has stepped forward to help flood relief efforts by donating US$ 50,000 to the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society.
Sri Lanka's worst floods in the last 14 years, triggered by Tropical Cyclone Mora, have significantly impacted communities across the country.
The heavy rain has resulted in more than 112,000 people and thousands of homes being displaced, according to Government estimates.
Our hearts go out to all the families across Sri Lanka who have lost their homes and possessions due this flooding disaster.We commend the efforts of the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society in helping affected communities through this difficult time, said Anthony Watson, Visa Country Manager for Sri Lanka.
We are glad a global organization like Visa is donating to the Red Cross. This donation comes at a vital stage. It's indeed good to know that there are lots of organizations that donate at the peak time of a disaster, but the real challenge begins when we resettle communities and help people to get back to normalcy to live a dignified life said Jagath Abeysinge- President, Sri Lanka Red Cross.
The donation from Visa will support the work the Red Cross is doing in providing immediate humanitarian aid and relief efforts across the country.
