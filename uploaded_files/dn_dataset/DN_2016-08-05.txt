Pivithuru Hela Urumaya to demolish "Hanuma bridge" if constructed
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila said yesterday that if the bridge connecting Sri Lanka and India known as "Hanuma bridge" was constructed, they are ready to demolish it.
He stressed this point at a press conferenceat his party office in Pitakotte yesterday. Gammanpila also said the public opinion should be sought before constructing this bridge.
"Do not construct it out of fear for India. This bridge can change the ethnic ratio in the country. Many non communicable diseases will enter into our country through the bridge. The Indian Highways Minister said the Hanuma bridge will be constructed and USD 5.3 billion loan had been sought for the purpose. Minister Lakshman Kiriella refuted it in Parliament as a total lie. Direct Indian invasion is about to come. The Indian minister had made a statement in Hindi in Indian Parliament. I don't understand Hindi, but so far there had been no clarification in the newspapers with regard to his statement," he said.

Cooray to carry national flag at opening ceremony
RIO DE JANEIRO, THURSDAY: The stage is set for the worlds greatest spots extravaganza  the XXX1st edition of summer Olympic Games, which gets underway on Friday night with a spectacular opening ceremony to be staged at the Olympic Stadium here.
Carrying Sri Lankas lion flag at the opening ceremony will be veteran marathon runner Anuradha Indrajith Cooray. The London-based Sri Lankan long distance runner will be competing in his third Olympic Games, having done so in Athens 2004 and London 2012 Games.
It is a great honour and important milestone in my career as an athlete. I am thankful to the authorities for giving me my deserving place. I will make every effort to live up to expectations, the 38-year-old former South Asian Games gold medallist said.
I have been training hard ever since I gained qualifying standers for Rio Olympics last year. My target is to go for a timing of two hours and 12 to 13 minutes. If I could make it, I feel I could finish within the first ten. But it all depends on how the external conditions such as weather as well. It happened at last years World Championships as unfavourable London weather increased the timings of all 100 odd marathon runners, he said.
Swimmers Matthew Abeysinghe and Kimiko Raheem have been training hard at a nearby training pool under the watchful eyes of veteran Manoj Abeysinghe who has already proved his class with his Killer Whales academy. I have been training hard, ready for the challenge ahead. It is a touch task but I will try my best to improve on my Sri Lanka record set last month, the seven-time gold medallist at the last South Asian Games said.
The biggest challenge that the Lankan Olympians are facing is adjusting to the time difference as Rio is some eight and a half hours behind Sri Lanka time. Five-time gold medallist at 2016 South Asian Games Raheem feels it the most as she has been training in Thailand, which is some ten hours ahead of Rio time. Nevertheless, Raheem has managed her daily schedule to Rio time ever since her return to Colombo after a year-long IOC solidarity scholarship training in Phuket.
All nine members of the Sri Lanka contingent for Rio 2016 Games have now arrived in Brazil and are housed at the Olympic Village which gives accommodation to over 10,000 athletes and coaches from all over the world. The first Lankan to be seen in action at Rio 2016 Olympics will be 17-year-old Kimiko, the youngest of the three Raheem sisters  all medallists at South Asian Games. She will be competing in her pet event next Monday (8).
The Olympic torch arrived in Rio last evening by boat after a three-month tour of Brazilian cities. Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Eduado Paes carried the Olympic torch on its first few laps through the city centre.

National govt. should have been formed in 2009: Devapriya
A national government should have been formed immediately after the war in 2009. But, the former leader did not do this. It if was done, Sri Lanka would have gone much forward today, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said.
The Chief Minister was addressing a workshop organised by the Information Department in collaboration with the Western Provincial Council and the Institute for Constitutional Studies to educate senior state officials in the Western Province on the implementation of the Right to Information (RTI) Bill yesterday. The RTI which was ratified into law by the Speaker yesterday, was one of the main pledges of the Yahapalana government, Devapriya said.
He said the right to information is often described as the fourth basic right of the people.
"Today, we have been able to reaffirm this right and the people can now obtain the information they require from all government institutions," he said.
"There are certain people in the Opposition engaged in useless frolics which have no benefits and importance to the people. But they have forgotten that they cannot topple this government until 2020 by force," Devapriya said.
The Chief Minister said due to these childish activities, Sri Lanka will be stagnant without going forward.
Devapriya said since non of the two major political parties got a clear majority at previous elections, they could not bring any useful legislation such as the RTI.
"We will be able to pass such important Bills in the future to ensure the people's rights further, he added.
Government Information Department Director General Dr. Ranga Kalansooriya said the main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the Right of Access to Information, to specify grounds on which access may be denied, to establish the Right to Information commission, to appoint Information Officers and to set out the procedure and for matters connected with it.
It is expected to foster a culture of transparency and accountability in public authorities by giving effect to the right of access to information and thereby promote a society in which the people would be able to more fully participate in public life through combating corruption and promoting accountability and good governance, he said.
He said that plans are afoot to educate senior state officials on the implementation of this Bill in Provincial level in due course.
Dr. Kalansooriya said with the implementation of the RTI, state offices are under obligation to provide information as soon as they get requests from the public.
It will take at least six months to implement the RTI and there should be an early preparedness by training information officers in every Department, he said.
"There should also be an information service such as management service and accountancy service. Although we were the last in South Asia to bring in the RTI legislation, ours has been recognised as the seventh best RTI law in the world," he added.
