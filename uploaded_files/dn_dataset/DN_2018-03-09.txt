Army ensures safety of all communities
Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake visited Kandy last morning and took stock of developments taking place in the aftermath of the recent violence that sparked in the Digana, Galaha, Katugastota, Menikhinna, Ambetenna, Akurana, Poojapitiya and a few other areas.
At the outset, he paid obeisance to the Malwatta Chapter Maha Nayake Thera and met with Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijeywardene, before meeting with the Central Province Governor, Chief Minister, Security Forces Commander, Division 11 Commanding General Officer, senior Navy and Air Force Officers and a cross-section of civil administrators and moulavis in the upcountry.
In a separate meeting held at the Pallekele Security Force Headquarters - Central (SFHQ-C) Division 11 Headquarters, the Army Commander received a comprehensive briefing about the spate of incidents that led to ethnic tension and subsequent acts of violence. He underlined the importance of maintaining security surveillance in the affected areas, with the participation of tri-service personnel, while supporting the police to restore normalcy. He also made inquiries from both SF-C Commander Major General Rukmal Dias and Division 11 Commanding General Officer Major General Nissanka Ranawana, with regard to the deployment of troops in vulnerable areas and precautionary measures that have been adopted.
Afterwards, he also had separate meetings with the Central Province Governor and the Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake, before visiting the central mosque (Maha Palliya).
More than 15 chief moulavis expressed their concerns on the prevailing developments in their respective areas and the need to strengthen security. They also insisted the continued presence of Army personnel in those areas. Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake said that he would provide full security to mosques and villages where Muslim communities reside.
Troops would ensure the safety of all civilians and property and do everything possible to bring normalcy to affected areas soon. Army personnel would neither vacate those areas until security is guaranteed for all ethnic groups nor allow anyone to cause any further damage. I assure you the best of protection, since it is the duty of the Army to maintain peace in the country and guarantee the safety of all races. All ethnic groups have co-existed peacefully in this country for generations, in the spirit of brotherhood and understanding. We should understand that our mutual bonds of friendship should not be disturbed due to anti-social acts of a handful of saboteurs, the Commander added.
It is unfortunate to find that some outside elements who had come to Senkadagala, had created this situation. Senkadagala has a peaceful population and they would not resort to such actions, the Commander said.
During his meeting with the Governor, Commander Senanayake, referring to a Presidential directive in this connection, told the Governor that the Army would be able to complete the reconstruction work of damaged buildings before the Vesak festival.
Commander Senanayake also visited a school where certain displaced civilians had sought temporary refuge.

The two principals of both Schools E.D. Thambimuttu of Christian College, Kotte belonging to the Church Missionary Society (CMS) and Duncan de Silva of St. Thomas. college, Kotte belonging to the Catholic Church met together on the invitation of Mr. Thambimuttu and decided to commence the big match between the two schools in Kotte. Christian College is the oldest and the first English CMS School established in 1822 in Sri Lanka by Rev. Samuel Lambrick and St. Thomas College is the youngest Catholic school in Kotte extablished by Rev. Fr. W.Z. Dabrera (O.M.I) in 1928.
The two Principals decided to play the cricket match in their College grounds at Kotte from 1941. The first captain of Christian College was Nandadasa Walpitage and first captain of St. Thomas College was M.D. Rathnasara.
In 1950, this annual cricket big match was named as the Battle of Kotte and Percy R. Perera captained Christian College while M.D. Milton captained St. Thomas College Kotte that year. The match was played at Chrisitian College grounds and C.M.S. won by 163 runs.

Another memorable big match was played in 1983 where the Kotte Thomians recorded victory in the last ball of the day, chasing a very low target of 86 runs.
The opponents were sent back to the pavilion by just 72 runs, thanks to Palitha Liyanage who captured 7 wickets for 26 runs in the second innings. Last Outright win recorede in 2003 when the St. Thomas College won the big match undert the captaincy of Aron Janz.

Govt has created present conflict
National Freedom Front Parliamentarian Jayantha Samaraweera yesterday said that the country is now moving towards political uncertainty .The MP charged that the government has created the background for this Sinhala-Muslim conflict in order to put all conflicts within the government under the carpet and also to fulfill the wishes of the Tamil diaspora, India and other Western powers.
"The death of a Sinhalese man at the hands of Muslims would not have led to anti-Muslim riots in Digana and Teldeniya in Kandy district if the police had immediately taken the assailants into custody and filed cases against them," he said.
The MP condemned the government's intervention in passing unpatriotic bills in Parliament taking advantage of the conflict situation prevailing in the country.
He charged that the Bill for protection against enforced disappearances which was passed in Parliament on Wednesday will betray the war heroes of the country. People of this country should not let the government put these unpatriotic bills into practice.
MP Samaraweera further asked the police to reveal the real culprits behind the issue of the Muslim-run hotel in Ampara which was alleged to have served food mixed with a contraceptive pill and he further asked the government to reveal the name of the government politician behind this issue.

Miscreants instigating violence must be punished Dr Udagama
For a country to move forward, miscreants who instigate ethnic or religious animosity should be dealt with decisively, swiftly and fairly within the law irrespective of whoever they are or their social standing or political affiliation, said Dr Deepika Udagama speaking to the Daily News yesterday.
It is the only way to stem this sort of situation and the country to move forward. Every citizen should be given the message that no one can break the law and turn this country into another inferno by spewing hatred between communities, she reiterated.
Speaking with a heavy heart referring to the recent incidents in the Kandy district, Dr Udugama said that according to information received, those responsible for the attacks and torching were not residents of the area. She also said that there have been a whole stream of attempts that have taken place after the civil war was ended in 2009, to create communal disharmony in the country. It is some relief that the citizens have shown more restraint compared to the ethnic violence of July 1983. What type of human being that can take delight in the suffering of others than persons with deranged minds, she questioned.
In addition to inquiring into the complaints received daily, the Human Rights Commission has a duty to stand completely devoted to the necessity of creating a larger Human Rights consciousness and culture in the country. The HR situation in the country has seen some improvement in the past years but these improvements will be lost if we dont work hard to sustain them. One must realise that if someones rights are undermined, your own rights are undermined as well, the Chairperson said.
Human Rights ethos and value base should not merely be in our heads but be in our hearts and in our DNA, Dr Udagama said. To achieve this and improve the HR situation in the country, she said that a two-pronged approach was necessary. Firstly, she said that the foci of the education system should be to create citizens with good democratic and liberal values, who would know how to live in a pluralistic society recognising their rights as well as those of others. We have to start young and start by de-segregating schools, she said.
According to Dr Udagama, the second issue that should be dealt with was the communication dimension. Media must play an absolutely positive role to promote democracy in a country.
The moment the media plays truant then society is in deep trouble she emphasised. At present, as social media plays a major role in communication, she said that the HRC has no objection to regulating social media in an even-handed and fair manner to ensure that the rights of children, religious and ethnic harmony is protected as social media is more a personal and intimate communication tool compared to conventional media.
We as citizens have to unite and work together in this difficult period to deal with these sensitive issues positively and bravely for the country to move forward.
This sort of situation requires very bold as well as swift decisive steps to stem this sort of incidents as we have suffered enough due to this sort of violence, she said.
Dr Udagama said that as these two communities have lived in harmony for centuries, at this moment it was necessary now to get together as a country and build on the strength and mutual respect and not let these mischievous elements deny us and our future generations of living in a peaceful and decent society.

The Government Analysts Department has confirmed that samples of particles found in food sold at a local eatery in Ampara does not contain sterilising chemicals as alleged but were mere clumps of flour.
Government Analyst A. Weliangage told the Daily News that the particles were clumps of flour, contents of carbohydrates.
We have sent a detailed report to the Ampara Magistrate and the DIG as there is an ongoing investigation related to this incident. He debunked the popular misconception that sterilisation pills were sold in the food, adding that they were clumps of flour.
A tense situation arose in Ampara on February 27 when an eatery owned by a Muslim was accused of mixing sterilization pills with food served to non-Muslim patrons.
A video of the owner having to admit the crime under duress went viral sparking violence and racial riots.

Cornwalls forgotten corner
Juliet Coombe discovers the magic of two time locked English villages as the snow melts and the stormy weather moves on
The shrill wind wrapped around my head, swirling like a whirling dervish grabbing everything it touched with its icy fingers, including the twin villages of Kingsand and Cawsands colourful fishing trawlers that could easily be mistaken for 18th century wreckers boats. Bobbing furiously around in the forbidding sea, merciless and menacing as it built up and crashed its way to the shoreline and waves hit the tips of the clock tower clock hands. I felt, as the snow fell across the time-locked forgotten villages that use to straddle the divide between Cornwall and Devon until the Tamar became the dividing line, as if, like the settling snow turning it into a frozen wasteland, time had really stopped. It was a bit like I had stepped out of Turners infamous Wreckers painting into a 19th century world, where people still matter and going out for dinner at one of the three local pubs - Cross Keys Inn, the Devonport Inn and the Halfway house Inn - would not leave you bankrupt for the rest of the year. Here, in this historic drinking hole, where pirates and smugglers plotted many a subterfuge, the conversations around the open fire are friendly and never dull. For those with a love of fish pie the Halfway House Inn makes a cracking dish and in the summer the beer garden really comes into his own.
The little known villages, situated on the Rame Peninsula in the parish of Maker-with-Rame, are known historically for their maze of smugglers tunnels and mysterious yearly traditions that no one can quite explain. Cawsand overlooks Plymouth Sound and Cawsand folk are proud of the fact that they saw off a serious Spanish attack in 1596 by the local militia. Defenses were built soon after to protect it from further sea invasions. Strangely, some places do feel more like forgotten bits of a Spanish walled city than a Cornish coastal town.
Remnants of fort battlements can be seen against crumbling historic sea walls and theres even a World War 2 Pill Box for guarding against enemy attacks, which have become features of this quirky place that was used to make the feature film on Turner, the artist and many of the locals will tell you stories about which bit part they played in it. Today, while the sun is out, they act as a perfect spot to take out your own easel to paint the exciting and dramatic weather conditions of the seas that on the most stormy of days can make the village almost vanish under thirty-foot waves and yet, when the sun sets in summer, reminds you of the South of France as the sky turns every color of a painters palette. It is the extremes of this forgotten corner and the incredible raw natural beauty that captivate all who make the long and winding journey to discover it. It is exciting even when it is cut off by the Beast of the East March snow storm that has ground England to a halt this year, and make it, even when cut off from the outside world, such an attractive place for the true adventurer. It is a place isolated due to its geography, as it is bounded by the English Channel, Plymouth Sound, the River Tamar and the River Lynher, which mean you have to double back on yourself if you want to see a place where even the sea surf turned to ice sculptures for a couple of days.
Steeped in history, the many military fortifications, fascinating archaeological finds, and houses with thick walls, each with a different heritage story to tell, are made from Cornish rocks once traded with the Roman Empire and stones from the area that are thickly plastered over, with only wood burners to keep them warm. Every house seems different with a vast range of quirks, crags, twists, steps, curves and narrow passages winding their way past many once windowless houses that in the past did not want to be discovered  unless, of course, you wanted to have your husband and son stolen by the Navy for active service against the Spanish or whoever else was favourite enemy of the month.
For children, this is paradise, as you can walk to the beach in a few minutes and explore the many rock pools or build sand castles from the pebble and sandy causeways. Then, buy a hot chocolate or an ice cream before exploring the narrow lanes leading to charming shops including a gallery exhibiting local artists and artisans, quirky cafs, eccentric souvenir shops and, after a hearty lunch, you can enjoy one of the great scenic walks along the stunning 800 acre Mount Edgecombe Country Park, with its restored mansion and Grade 1 listed gardens and the rugged Rame Head Peninsula and the Signal Point, which is no longer operational and has been turned into posh housing. These are amongst the most spectacular and peaceful walks in Britain and go on for as far as the eye can see.
Ever changing dramatic scenery makes even a bad weather day fun and for those who love this quaint 19th century lifestyle there is always a ferry service from Cawsand beach to Plymouth Hoe, where you can escape for the day to enjoy traditional British fish and chips and climb up Smeatons Tower, open to the public all year round and offering a wonderful vantage point from its old lantern room.
They say it takes a village to raise a child and only a time locked treasure to revive the child in all of us. Whether its finding your ancestors in the graveyard of the thousand year old Norman Church on the hill above the two villages or looking for a Turner spot to capture the magical light that covers the city with golden flecks of light at dawn as the sun comes up over the ocean in time for the tolling of the church bells and the sound of the crashing waves. This is a forgotten corner where life is simple, the community matters and nature still rules the waves and luckily smugglers are no longer allowed to wave the rules.

Hate shall have no home
The Government has declared a state of emergency and a police curfew is enforced in the Kandy district. This was a sequel to communal clashes that erupted following two isolated incidents in Ampara and Digana, Kandy during the last few days. Both incidents led to widespread attacks on private residences, business establishments and mosques of Muslims by Sinhala mobs.
Obviously these mobs have taken the law into their hands instead of allowing the law enforcement authorities to deal with those responsible for the above two incidents. This shows that inter-communal relations had developed to such an extent that any untoward incident could ignite communal violence on a large scale.
It could be recalled that similar incidents took place earlier at Gintota in Galle and in Alutgama. There was also a series of isolated but well - orchestrated attacks on Muslim business premises and places of religious worship of Muslims and several Christian sects. The pattern of all these incidents shows the working of an invisible hand, an organised movement that wants to create communal discord.
There are also allegations that the police were hesitant to intervene to prevent the occurrence of such riots and some of them were in fact collaborating with those who attacked the Muslims. These allegations cannot be ignored. They should be investigated and if the allegations are proved those responsible should be punished. That is the only way the Government can get itself exonerated from the blame the people can get an assurance such incidents wont be repeated in future.
Communal clashes
Recalling a similar development of a series of communal clashes sporadically in time and space prior to the anti-Tamil pogrom of 1983 July, one gets the impression that the present developments could also unleash such brutal mayhem at any moment. The only difference would be the victims this time would be the Muslims instead of Tamils. If it happens it would be a national calamity with repercussions on a greater scale. We would again be black-listed among the international community, as a savage and uncivilized nation. We would have to say Good Bye to foreign investments, tourism and development.
Further escalation of inter-communal clashes after the July 1983 pogrom led to a thirty-year old fratricidal war with immense loss of lives and property. The causes that gave cause to the war still remain unresolved. The perpetuation and deterioration of the present volatile and explosive atmosphere may lead to another communal war where the country will be doomed.
Hence, it is imperative that the present situation must not be allowed to continue. Ethnic or religious violence should stop. One reason for the occurrence of such communal riots is that those who were responsible for earlier riots and mayhem were not punished. All governments including the present one have failed in that respect. Therefore the criminals and those who espouse the cause of racism or religious fundamentalism enjoy a wide immunity and even claim to be patriots.
Allegations against the police
It should also be mentioned that the masses, whatever their race or creed are not communalist. It has always been the case that those who resort to communal violence are persons living outside the localities in which the clashes occur. The presence of considerable numbers of outsiders, who had come prepared to attack the innocent villagers were seen by witnesses. The Police would have seen them but for some reason or other they have not intervened to prevent a breach of the peace. This may be a cause for allegations against the police.
The question to be asked and answered is this: Who benefits by spreading communalism and instigating communal violence One such party is clearly visible. That is the opportunist politicians who want either to retain power or regain lost power by arousing communalist passions in the electorate. But there are others too. Rival business interests among various communities could also use communalism to gain monopoly command of economic interests. There may also be geo-political ambitions of foreign powers that would provide stimulus to trouble-makers to destabilize society.
Muslims have lived in peace and harmony with the Sinhala and Tamil people for centuries in our country. They have contributed to the independence struggle against the colonial powers and have been partners in the development of the country. They did not join the Separatist rebels and stood for the integrity of the country. They still are patriotic citizens except for a handful of bad eggs as found among any community.
What is more unfortunate in the present context is to see communal mayhem committed in the name of religion. The Maha Nayake Theras and dignitaries of other religions have now openly condemned the riots and called for peaceful coexistence of all communities. It is commendable. How much commendable it would have been if they could do so much earlier.
Peace and reconciliation
Communalism is like cancer. Once it enters the body politic it spreads incessantly destroying every vital organ of society. Hence the only way out is early detection and sharp surgical intervention when necessary.
Now that it has woken from the slumber, we hope it would act swiftly and resolutely to wipe out the cancer of racialism from the society.
We call upon all political parties to get together for the purpose of stopping racial and religious violence and ensure a peaceful future for our people. They could form joint peace and reconciliation committees at ground level without trading accusations against one another for political gain. The local government bodies that would be instituted soon could also join such efforts.
The civil society and its organisations as well as the mass media also have a huge responsibility to see that all possible efforts are taken to prevent racism raising its ugly head and destroying our social fabric. For, the ultimate arbitrator is the civil society itself.

Waste is anything your business intends to discard, or handles or produces and is not wanted or required. Disposing of waste can have a significant impact on the environment. Producing excessive amounts of waste is often a sign that your business processes may be inefficient.
Waste management is the process of disposal, processing, controlling, recycling and reusing of waste to maintain a habitable environment. Industrial waste management refers to the solid, liquid and gaseous emissions, residual and unwanted wastes from an industrial operation. Industrial wasted are hazardous since they are corrosive, reactive and toxic hence leading to extensive pollution.
Industrial waste can be reduced through recycling, treatment before release and utilizing bio-friendly methods of manufacturing. Its vital to study solid, biological, waste water, hospital waste and chemical waste management separately to maximize the profit and to build up an environmentally friendly process.
This includes the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste together with monitoring and regulation. It also encompasses the legal and regulatory framework that relates to waste management encompassing guidance on recycling. Laboratory safety is of paramount importance.
The purpose of this laboratory safety and chemical hygiene plan is to provide guidance for the safe handling of all hazardous chemicals in laboratories, ensure compliance and other applicable regulations and demonstrate that this plan meets or exceeds the requirement.

JK Rowling and my Billionaire Dog..!
Jeff, my German-shepherd dog, who doesnt think too highly of my writing skills, looked contemptuously at me as I tapped away on my laptop, How long he asked.
Another half hour, I said not looking at him, Im a bit stuck, and if you dont disturb my thoughts, maybe even twenty minutes!
I dont mean your column, growled Jeff looking disinterestedly at my computer screen.
What are you talking about then I asked surprised.
How long you going to take to become a billionaire
A what I exclaimed upsetting my screen, which scrolled and unscrolled whatever I had written.
A billionaire, said my dog patiently, is a someone who makes a thousand million dollars.
Thats a lot of money, I sighed.
So how long you going to take to make that kind of money asked Jeff again.
Im a writer, I said, not some rich industrialist or budding politician. Writers are born poor, live poor and die poor!
Not anymore master. Does this face look familiar he asked pawing a newspaper picture lying on the ground, This ones a billionaire!
JK. Rowling! I said.
Good, now that you know who she is, maybe you need to know what she earned
How much I whispered.
One billion dollars! growled my dog.
How I asked.
By writing well, said my dog simply.
I thought I do, I sniffed.
Your bank balance would reveal exactly the kind of writer you are, said my suddenly very business like dog, as he opened my pass book now as of yesterday, you have....
Sssshhh.. I whispered.
So master we need to improve your writing.
We I asked.
Well its to my interest too, said my clever dog. Your billions will directly affect my life style. No more will I have to shiver during winter mornings, for lack of warm quilt!
Look at the rug you lie on, I said, its fit for a king.
Yeah but I wonder what Rowlings dog goes to sleep on Could be a four-poster bed!
Thats if Mrs. Rowling has a dog! I ventured.
Thats a thought! pondered Jeff.
Whats a thought I asked.
If she doesnt have dog maybe shed want one.
I assume the dog shed want, would be you
Yes of course,
And pray why I asked.
Because Im a specialist dog, a professional at being a writers dog. Experienced to a writers mood swings, competent with dealing with irrational behavior, proficient at handling melancholy, sulks and bouts of depression!
Go, I said angrily, go to your billionaire writer!
But first youll have to learn to write.
Why should I I asked, youre going.
Yes but you need to write a testimonial for me, something which is up to Rowlings literary standards; a reference letter, from writer to writer. So, Ive bought some books for you master. The faster you learn to write, the faster Ill be a billionaire dog..!

JOs no confidence motion against PM an illusion - State Minister
State Minister Dilip Vedaarachchi adresssing a meeting at the UNP office at Tangalle said that the Joint Opposition consists of a gang that robbed the resources of the country and those who involved themselves in various corruptions and malpractices.
It was this gang that will present to the Parliament a no confidence motion against the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who is reputed as clean politician without any allegation of whatsoever.
The State Minister said that Mahinda Rajapaksa led the Provincial Council Election to become the Prime Minister. It was a dream. Since he will not get the premier post, now the Joint Opposition is urging him to take the post of Leader of the Opposition.
The State Minister said that he was not aware of such a leader in the world as Mahinda Rajapaksa who reached the highest post of President, who contested an electorate to become a Parliamentarian later.
His other dream is to crown his prince who has played out a colossal sum of state funds and public property.
Is such a prince suitable to become a leader of the country the State Minister asked.

Journalist group calls for law and order
The Sri Lankan Journalists for Global Justice (SLJGJ) strongly condemned the violence targeting Muslims in areas around Kandy and asked the government to arrest those responsible.
Addressing a press conference on Thursday, they stated that the mobs exhibited a racist, communalist character. SLJGJ President and former Editor  in  Chief of the Daily News Jayatilleke de Silva said that no self-respecting person should approve of the conduct of the mob.
He said such attacks on minorities are sadly common.
If you go through the history of this country, you see that similar incidents have taken place prior to the 1983 riots, he said. Since no action was taken against the perpetrators, it blew up into a war  we do not want the same to be repeated again.
Latheef Farook, a journalist who has relatives in the affected area, said that before the mob attacks Digana was one of the most peaceful places in the country.
(But) outside elements came in to attack, he said. The main failure here is one of law and order.
He said the presence of monks known to associate with radical groups at a local funeral over the weekend should have triggered a stronger police presence. The ensuing violence damages the whole country, he said.

## Title: JustPay powers first cashless sale in Sri Lanka
## Supertitle:

JustPay powers first cashless sale in Sri Lanka
JustPay, aground breaking initiative of LankaPay to convert the large number of cash based retail payments,went into full swing at the MAS Arena, Royal College on March 4, 2018.
UPay, the very first JustPay powered Smart Phone app to go live, conducted a historic cashless sale in partnership with Cargills bank, for the very first time in Sri Lanka, with the participation of more than 75 small time merchants and a large number of enthusiastic Smart phone users.
This was a gigantic step forward in moving Sri Lanka towards a less cash society as the norm for such an event was to use cash as the payment mode especially when small time merchants are involved.
Since a majority of the merchants in the country are small timers where the number of daily transactions at each outlet are low in value and limited in number, many thought it would not be practical at all to move them away from cash. The primary obstacle to reduce cash transactions was the commission (Merchant Discount Rate or MDR) charged by banks from merchants for use of credit/debit cards, which was hovering around 2-3% of the transaction value.
Considering the low profit margin for such small merchants from each sale was around 5%, parting a significant portion from their profit has always been a challenge. LankaPay understood this roadblock from the onset and removed this barrier by lowering the MDR for JustPay, so that the merchants would not have any objections to parting with a smaller commission in return for increased sales. To facilitate same, all member banks of LankaPay real-time payment system have agreed to reduce the electronic fund transfer fees to a nominal value to facilitate retail payments via JustPay.
The massive opportunity created by this major shift in the current payment eco system has encouraged innovative FinTech players, such as UPay, to come forward with solutions that provides ultimate consumer experience.
The need of finding merchants, making transactions in real-time and rating the merchants based on the user experience would be addressed by the innovative apps that uses JustPay payment mode.
UPay provided an ultimate convenience and a consumer experience to their customers at this cashless sale, by providing a Smart Phone app that a user could simply scan a QR code of a merchant and JustPay at checkout.
Most consumers who attended the cashless sale at the MAS arena was pleasantly surprised by the seamless mechanism UPay provided them to make a payment. These are the types of innovations that JustPay intends to bring to the market by providing a level playing field for such innovators to compete on the merits of their innovation.
The ultimate winners of this journey are the General Public by enjoying ultimate convenience and the country as a whole when the usage of cash would gradually reduce over time.
So, how did JustPay facilitate the innovative app UPay to provide ultimate convenience to their customers at the first cashless sale Previously, the merchant and the customer had to maintain bank accounts at the same bank, if they were to carry out a transaction via a fund transfer, which did not scale. However, LankaPay common real-time switch makes it possible to transfer funds without having to maintain accounts at a common bank.
This was an absolute game changer.A customer can simply register with the acquiring bank of UPay via the app by providing his bank details. Once this simple onetime registration is completed, he/she can simply pay through the app with one click or single button for every purchase by selecting the JustPay payment option.
In real time, the system would debit the customers account regardless of his bank and credit UPays merchant account at the acquiring bank. The same principle that provided ultimate user experience to UPay customers would be applicable not only at the just concluded cashless sale, but also at a hardware shop, corner grocery shop, pharmacy or even a vegetable vendor at the Sunday fair. The applicability of this principle would be widespread and only be limited by the extent of the imagination of such innovative FinTech companies.
In order to further simplify the payment process and improve customer experience, LankaPay is in the process of implementing a centralized system where the account holder's bank would be responsible to issue a nickname to each of their authorized bank accounts.
Once this system goes live, a customer would merely need his mobile number or NIC and the nickname of the bank account he/she wishes to use to register with a payment app via their Smart mobile phone and the centralized system would translate this information into carrying out the registration.
Once registered, a user would only need to know the other partys mobile number or NIC and the nickname to make a real-time payment. This centralized system would be available within a few weeks and would further simplify the process.
LankaPay is also in the process of introducing a standardized QR code for the merchants end with the concurrence of Central Bank. All a merchant would require in the future is just a QR code sticker pasted at his shop to accept a payment and a low cost mobile device to receive a SMS to indicate that his account has received the payment. This is going to make it absolutely convenient for customers to make payments and would revolutionize the entire payment landscape in the country.
The advantage of this system is that it would provide ultimate convenience to busy individuals. The day would not be longer where a customer would be able to order dinner after work from a small boutique food outlet and get the food delivered via a delivery service such as Quickee or Grasshoppers by the time he goes home without having to physically visit the shop. The consumers would not mind paying a small convenience fee for making their lives easier, which would save them a lot of time and the hassle. Such opportunities would lead to further innovation, as apps can be created to coordinate between small retail shops and independent delivery services so that even a small time food outlet would be able to deliver food to homes without having its own delivery channel.When you make the systems so simple to use, it will enable customers to pay a small-scale grocery shop, corner laundry outlet or even easily make a payment to a domestic worker. The customer ratings for merchants via the same apps would take care of the quality of the food and the delivery service levels offered.
This is bound to bring more innovative FinTech players into the forefront to solve common problems of the General Public via technology and harness the massive opportunity presented to them.Already a few innovative apps have gone live on JustPay, such as UPay, IPay and DirectPay while Genie, FriMe and PickMe are planning to go live within the next few weeks. Customers of BoC, Sampath, Cargills and NTB are already using the apps that are currently live while Commercial bank and HNB would soon ensure that these apps can be used by their customers as well. Thus, the dawn of JustPay would propel our brilliant tech savvy entrepreneurs to think out-of-the-box and create more innovative apps to address the daily needs of all citizens.

Maddumabandara new Law and Order Minister
Two weeks after assuming duties as the Minister of Law and Order, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe relinquished the post and vested it in Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara. yesterday.
The Prime Minister when taking over the ministry stated that a new Minister of Law and Order would be decided on within two weeks.
Maddumabandara assumes leadership of the Police at a time when it has been accused of being slow to act in preventing the communal clashes which took place in Kandy over the past couple of days.
Within hours of taking over office however, the Prime Minister yesterday directed the newly appointed Law and Order Minister to submit a report on the workings of the National Police Commission (NPC). The PM had insisted that this be his first order of duty after assuming office.
This follows complaints made to the Prime Minister by the police hierarchy stating the Commission had not taken steps to provide the Police with an overall practical plan of action but instead questioned them of shortcomings when things went wrong. This they stated created issues when implementing the law and resulted in overall confusion.
For example, though the NPC Secretary had asked the IGP to submit a report on the incident in Rajanganaya, the Chairman of the NPC had informed the Prime Ministers office that such a report was not needed. The Prime Minister thus directed the Minister to find out as to why the Secretary had asked for a report in the first place.
Minister Maddumabandara who took his oaths as the new Minister of Law and Order before President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday morning later visited the Hunupitiya Gangaramaya to participate in religious observances.
The Mahasangha led by Gangarama Viharadhipati Ven. Galboda Gnanissara thera chanted seth pirith and thereafter Ven. Kirinde Assaji thera placed the casket of Sacred Relics on Minister Maddumabandaras head and invoked blessings on him. Speaking to the Media, Minister Maddumabandara said he would endeavour to safeguarded unity among all communities and transform Sri Lanka into a land where everyone can live in peace, freedom and unity. He was thankful to both the President and the Prime Minister for placing trust and faith in him and handing over this vital Ministry to him under the present crisis situation.
He observed that a minor incident had gone this far because some people had been sowing the seeds of communalism for the past several years.
The country has lost thousands of lives in a senseless war. We should all learn lessons from our past wrongs and misdeeds and work towards diffusing the present tension, the new Law and Order Minister said.

Mini marvels!
An artist has created a miniature world by pairing tiny figures with everyday objects. Pter Cskvri spent two years working on Tiny Wasteland after he was inspired by his work as a chef and food photographer.
Pter, 29, from Hungary, said: I started my food photographer career there, but I didnt have much work, so I combined the food photography with these little figures.
I found a miniature worker set in a model shop in Guernsey. I put them together with some blueberries, and that was the first picture.
He said he wanted to create situations that people had never seen before, using mundane objects or diet staples.
Some of the scenes are ever so slightly sinister in mood.
The Budapest-based artist, whose work has already appeared in the Sony World Photography Awards at Somerset House in London, says his strange creations have been well received.
He said: Everyone who has seen them already loves them. Theyve been around the world. One morning I saw my pictures on a Mexican morning TV show, and on the same day my pictures appeared in a magazine in Cuba.
Pters work will be exhibited in Budapest in April.

Mucky monkeys mucking about
The indescribable menaces of monkeys are almost, day in and day out, in the Vavuniya town can be intolerable. They freely move into the residential areas, where people live. They destroy fruits, plantains, papaws, mangoes, young leaves, blooms and king coconuts, in which they put an eye hole to drink, and so on.
Not only that they enter inside the houses through small openings and annihilate the things but also dirty the places by defecating, in the absence of the residents, during the day time when they were out for work or other purposes. Most importantly, they get into the kitchen and eat food items and devastate the place by damaging the containers of the provisions rice, flour, sugar, grains and so on.
Personally, I experienced the trouble of monkeys, in my area Kurumankadu. Seriously, monkey bites also often take place; that happens when the people try to chase them away they get furious and approach to bite them. Remarkably, small children are afraid of monkeys.
Some from the neighbourhood complain with regrets, monkeys sometimes, take their valuable documents, items such as phone, purse, chain, bangle etc., and throw them somewhere else. Worst of all, we are unable to dry our washed clothes as they take them off from the lines and put them in the next door compounds. Residents who stay home, light firecrackers to threaten or curtail the monkeys; however, they are not scared as they are used to it and continue their pranks with dominance.
On the one hand, monkeys enter the human territory, in search of food and water, because they face a habitat loss as humans impinge on their territory. On the other hand, people of Vavuniya, Kurumankadu, face an immense predicament by the stray monkeys. We, the residents tried our hardest to chase them away, unfortunately, could not succeed in our attempt. Therefore, I would like to bring this issue to the limelight to the relevant authority, wildlife department of Sri Lanka to take serious abrupt action no sooner than later, to safegurd the dwellers as well as their belongings.

Muslim organisations assure support to President
The leaders of Muslim organisations extended their fullest support to President Maithripala Sirisena to establish a peaceful atmosphere conducive to all Sri Lankans to live in peace and harmony.
These sentiments were expressed during a meeting held by the President, with the members of Muslim organisations yesterday, at the Presidents Office to discuss the current situation prevailing in the country.
The President, pointing out that only a small group of extremist elements were responsible for riots, explained to the representatives that arresting them and taking legal action against them is already in process.
President Sirisena said the government has already taken all required measures to build a peaceful country for all to live in peace and harmony.
The Muslim representatives expressed their deep concern over the troubling incidents that occurred in several areas in the Kandy district and asked President Sirisena to take all steps to prevent such clashes, irrespective of religious or ethnic identities of culprits.
They expressed confidence that only President Sirisena could implement a long-term solution in order to ensure such clashes would not occur again and find a lasting solution to the issue during the tenure of the President.
The Muslim representatives added that legal action must be taken against individuals who are engaging in such anti-social acts without considering their positions. They also urged the President not to allow social media outlets to arouse any ethnic animosity through false propaganda.
The leaders of All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama (ACJU) and members of the Muslim Civil Society were present at the gathering.

## Title: Mystery MENDIS Carrom Ball a mystery now

Mystery MENDIS Carrom Ball a mystery now
Spin bowlers, especially off spinners come a plenty. Leg spin bowlers are a rarity. But so called mystery spinners are not made they are born with a mystery spin. Our own AJANTHA MENDIS was such a God given gift.
MENDIS with his mystery spin had the cricket world at his feet. When he first came into the game, he looked as though from out of this cricket world. His bowling action and the deliveries he bowled were bemusing, cunning and amazing having batsmen out even before they faced him.
The first mystery spinner that I can remember when I took to the game as an under 12 cricketer was West Indian Sonny Ramadhin in the early 1950s. Then there was also Australian Jack Iverson.
Then towards the end of the previous century saw the emergence of Australian Johnny Gleeson. Ramadhin, Iverson and Gleeson made opposing batsmen look utterly helpless unable to read what sort of spin they were going to impart that more often than not bamboozled the best of batsmen.
Land that cricket forgot
With Ramadhin, Iverson and Gleeson leaving the field after rewriting the record books and going into the land that cricket forget, but batsmen who faced them remembered and heaving sighs of relief came the mystery spinner of them all in Sri Lankas BALAPUWADUGE AJANTHA WINSLO MENDIS.
MENDIS came into the game like a comet. And when that comet had the in-born talent to shine in the galaxy like the moon and bemuse batsmen, selectors of that era made him suffer an inglorious exit doing like what happened to the goose that laid the golden egg. They played him in too much cricket and his end was predictable in coming.
MENDIS introduced into the array of the many deliveries bowled with a new one which was termed a CARROM BALL which had batsmen putting bat to ball not having t he slightest inkling as to which way the ball would turn or go straight. Today cricket fans in jest call him CARROM BALL.
Cocktail of deliveries
That delivery was bowled with a flick of his middle finger. He bowled a cocktail of deliveries that included googlies, off-breaks, top-spinners, flippers and leg-breaks. The first batsman to get a taste of the CARROM BALL was Indias Rahul Dravid. Dravid offered a straight bat, but had the mortification to see the ball pitching on middle stump turn and hit off stump.
Talking of the CARROM BALL and cricketers who have introduced new vocabulary into cricket come the names of one of Indias greatest captains Mahenda Singh Dhoni who invented what is now called the HELICOPTER SHOT and Sri Lankas own opening batsman Tillekeratne Dilshan in whose name is the DIL SCOOP.
More forethought
MENDIS would have added many more Test wickets than the 70 he got, one day international 152 and Twenty20 wickets 66 to his kitty  had selectors of that MENDIS era acted with more foresight, sensibility and with common sense.
With winning being the greed where money gushed in to the governing body and the player, the selectors did a bit of overkill by continuously playing him and not thinking of his future where they played him in only 19 Tests, 87 One-Dayers and 39 Twenty20 games in a short period.
A bowler of MENDIS rare ability and class would have had better figures and won more Test matches for the country had he been persisted in the longer format of the game which what cricket is all about.
Stunned cricket world
In his debut in Test cricket he stunned the cricket world when in Three Test series against India he captured 26 wickets breaking the great England swing bowler ALEC BEDSERS world record of most wickets on debut in a Three-Test series. He also broke Indian Ajit Agarkars fasest 50 wicket record haul in ODI cricket in just 23 matches by going past Agarkars mark in just 19 matches.
In the 2008 Asia Cup final against India his figures of 6 for 13 was the third best for a spinner in ODIS. MENDIS bettered that record when he took 6 for 16 in the second Twenty20 against Australia thus becoming the first bowler to take 6 wickets in a Twenty20 international. Then in the opening match of the 2012 ICC World T20 he took 6 wickets for 8 runs against Zimbabwe which was truly amazing.
Accepted that he marveled in the one-day game with 152 wickets and 66 wickets in the Twenty20 games, but the selectors should have allowed him to strike gold in the longer format. After the quitting of MENDIS the game has seen two emerging champion mystery bowlers in left armer Lakshan Sandakan and right armer Akila Dhananjaya. Let them not be throw to the wolves like what MENDIS suffered.
Nursed and nurtured
Let them not be fumigated out of the game, but nursed and nurtured in Test cricket because they can bemuse and baffle batsmen to their demise and take the country to the top at Test level.
AJANTHA was born in Moratuwa from which town came the famous Duleep Mendis. He had his early education at St.Anthonys College at Kadalana and subsequently moved to Moratuwa Maha Vidyalaya where his talents were discovered by another famous Moratuwa cricketer Lucky Rodgers Fernando when he was just 13 years.
MENDIS won many accolades and awards during his short career one of them being the Emerging Player of the Year at the LG awards ceremony held in Dubai in 2008. He was one of the lucky players to survive when terrorists carried out an attack on the Sri Lankan cricketers in Lahore. He was among one of the seven injured in that dastardly attack.
Disc fracture
With the selectors consistently playing him in all formats of the game which was surely tiring and telling on his physique he suffered an injury termed disc fracture in the back which probably cost the country a gem of a mystery spinner who could have mystified the cricket world.
Th best accolade paid him was by Tony Becca the former veteran West Indies cricket writer which appeared in the Jamaican Gleaner. Becca wrote: MENDIS bowls everything. With a smile on his face as he caresses the ball before delivering it, he bowls the off break, he bowls a straight delivery, he bowls the googly, he bowls the flipper, he bowls a straight delivery, he bowls them with different grips and different actions, he bowls them with a difficult trajectory and at different pace, and he disguises them brilliantly. The result is that he mesmerizes, or bamboozles batsmen.
Sri Lanka cricket must be bursting at the seams hoping for another mystery bowler of the likes of AJANTHA MENDIS.

NASAs solar probe to the Sun
US: You can be a part of NASAs maiden mission to touch the sun. You dont need to have an astrophysics degree or be an expert of the cosmos. You simply have to give your name.
NASA has invited general public to send their names to be featured on its Parker solar probe that will be sent to suns atmosphere this summer. The spacecraft will travel to the suns atmosphere this July and your name can travel along. To sweeten the deal, Star Trek star William Shatners name would be among the many names that will be carried aboard the probe on a microchip, NASA announced on Twitter.
The spacecraft will also carry my name to the sun, and your name, and the names of everyone who wants to join this voyage of extreme exploration, the Star Trek actor said in a promotional video.
The Parker probe is scheduled to start its journey towards the suns atmosphere on July 31, coming as close as 4 million miles from its surface.
To protect itself from the intense heat of the sun, the spacecraft and instruments will be protected by a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite shield which will keep the insides at a comfortable room temperature. The aim of the mission is to study how the solar wind and energy affect Earth and other worlds.
This incredible spacecraft is going to reveal so much about our star and how it works that weve not been able to understand, said project scientist Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.
Although as small as a car, the probe is so fast, it can travel from Washington DC to Tokyo in under a minute, a NASA statement said.
Parker Solar Probe is, quite literally, the fastest, hottest - and, to me, coolest - mission under the sun, Ms Fox said. - NDTV

National Action Plan to combat corruption
A National Action Plan to combat corruption in Sri Lanka which will look into amending laws on bribery as well as introducing a corruption prevention programme will be prepared, said Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) Director General (DG), Presidents Counsel Sarath Jayamanne yesterday.
The Director General said they would also look into introducing laws to curb corruption and bribery in the private sector. Jayamanne addressing heads of media institutions at the Ministry of Mass Media and Finance, noted that Sri Lanka thus far there has been no national policy or action plan on corruption.
Further, for the last 24 years, since the establishment of CIABOC in 1994, bribery and asset declaration laws have not been amended, making it harder for the Commission to effectively deal with rampant corruption in the country. Sri Lanka is also one of only few countries in the world to not have experts in financial crime and corruption working in an anti-corruption agency.
In 1994, CIABOC was established in a hurried manner to fulfil an election promise and instead of hiring experts in the field, they took in police officers to fill vacancies. So we have had many problems in dealing with complicated crimes of corruption, Jayamanne said.
Last year however, the Public Service Commission and Ministry of Public Administration allowed the recruitment of 200 experts such as accountants, auditors, banking sector experts through an exam to work with CIABOC.
We will concentrate on three sections when making the law. They are; enforcement through the strengthening of key anti-corruption and law enforcement agencies, strengthening investigations and prosecutions of bribery and corruption; prevention through awareness programmes and public sector reforms (setting up of Integrity Units in the public sector to monitor corruption within the relevant institutions) and amending laws and policies such as asset declaration and bribery laws in keeping with the needs of the time.
CIABOC alone cannot own this plan and thus we will be seeking grassroots inputs when making the plan so the people will see it as their own, the CIABOC Director General added.
The DG aimed to set up a culture of anti-corruption in the country.
A 50 member team will be appointed to formulate this plan with special attention given to prevention programmes.
Immediate amendments approved by Cabinet to bribery laws, in the meantime, include allowing bribery cases to be filed in High Court instead of the Magistrate Courts to fast track cases and to allow CIABOC to direct serious cases to High Court where they can arrange a three judge bench to hear such cases on a daily basis. In addition, they will also bring in laws to allow CIABOC to use evidence from Presidential Commissions to investigate into corruption or investigate their findings further.
In 2017, 57 suspects were found guilty of corruption in courts, the highest in CIABOCs history, observed the DG as he promised that they were working on improving their prosecutions.
Though many say only the low level officials get prosecuted for corruption and the higher officials get away, it is because the former always get caught and those in high places think of ways in which they can get away before they commit a crime, the CIABOC Director General said.

New dairy products to nourish the nation
Pelwatte Dairy Industries will launch a range of new dairy based products. Utilizing factories and facilities in Buttala and Moneragala the company will make new products such as Drinking Yoghurt, UHT Milk, Flavoured UHT Milk, Infant Milk Powder and a collection of novel ice-cream flavours.
We have an ambitious plan for this year. We aim to release a number of new product ranges, some with flavours that have not been seen in the Sri Lankan market before. Extensive market research has been conducted over what is lacking in the dairy market in Sri Lanka, and will fill those gaps with quality assured products, said Pelwatte Dairys Managing Director, Akmal Wickramanayake.
Using only 100 per cent locally sourced milk, Pelwatte Dairy will launch a range of completely new drinking yoghurts for the Sri Lankan market. The product will provide consumers with a completely natural and organic product range.
Meanwhile the launch of unflavoured and flavoured UHT Milk is also on the cards. The re-launch will see fresh liquid milk sourced from farmers around the country reaching consumers in ready-to-use packaging. The existing flavoured milk line will also be revamped to provide consumers with a range of classic and new flavours of liquid milk. These will be a much-needed nutrition addition to childrens diets.
Also catering to the growing need of locally produced infant milk, Pelwatte Dairy will also take on the challenge of providing a quality assured and reasonable alternative to a market that is made up of predominantly foreign products.
The Pelwatte Ice-Cream range will be expanded with an exciting range of flavours. Once again no artificial colours and flavours will be used in these products to ensure highest quality. In addition to the new range of products Pelwatte Dairy also have plans to increase their production capacity for full cream milk powder by 50 per cent.

No room for complacency
As this is being written reports emerging from a much embattled Kandy indicate that things were returning to normal. The 24 hour curfew that was to run till 4 pm yesterday was lifted at 10 am, which also suggests that the police and the security forces had brought the situation under control. However, the government cannot afford to drop its guard. Although things have calmed on the surface there could be simmering tensions waiting to explode. Hence, the police and the forces should continue their presence in the area, at least for sometime. The Emergency too should be continued with, though it should not be extended more than is necessary, lest this sends the wrong signals to investors. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, no doubt, is fully cognizant of this and is bound to act accordingly.
While the healing process will take time, steps should, no doubt, be taken at rapprochement of the Sinhalese and the Muslims in the affected areas. It is best that religious leaders from both sides take upon this task rather than any politicians getting involved.Already, politicos from all sides are taking up positions and giving their own interpretations as to causes that led to the mayhem, with fingers too being liberally pointed. Joint Opposition firebrand Wimal Weerawansa told parliament that the incident was stage managed by the UNP leader as a diversionary tactic to wriggle out of the No Confidence Motion against him, while Dullas Alahapperuma has taken up a holier than thou posture in suddenly taking the Muslim community into his bosom. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, not to be outdone, has described the communal clashes as a government ploy to introduce the new constitution to divide the country at the behest of foreign powers. Is the former President trying to make the public believe that the victim lorry driver and the Muslim thugs who fatally injured him following a purely personal argument, that sparked the violence, had, at the behest of the UNP, conspired to stage the incident so that the government would be able to bring in a new constitution and divide the country
Equally, it cannot be denied that the incident was seized upon by political elements to create mayhem ala a July '83. Here too, the conspirators could not have known in advance that Prabhakaran would set off that fateful landmine, in Thinneveli, that killed 13 soldiers. But the termites came out the woodwork in next to no time, with the mob even armed with prepared lists of all Tamil homes.
This is why the government should get to the bottom of the conspiracy, and, ascertain how the rabble was put together in next to no time, if it is to avert a repetition of the unfortunate incidents. In this regard the statement made by Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne should be treated with all seriousness and acted upon swiftly.
Addressing journalists at the post Cabinet media briefing Dr. Senaratne said it has come to light that two MPs, four local government councillors, recently elected from a new party, a Bikkhu, known for his strong links to the pohottuwa, and, an electoral organiser, from the same party, were behind the whole conspiracy to incite communal violence, following the lorry driver incident. He said they had also come to know that the mobs were complete outsiders, transported to the area in buses and vehicles and that one of the MPs, representing the hill country, was directing operations, via his mobile phone. The minister said speedy action will be taken against the miscreants.
It is hoped that the minister will act true to his word and bring those responsible, before the law. We have seen that, in the past too, the names of politicians had transpired in connection with similar acts of violence, and, the identical pledge made by the powers that be, only to be consigned to the forgotten things of limbo, with the passage of time. Incitement of communal passions is far too serious an offence to be similarly treated and the minister should follow through his statement with concrete action. Who knows, it could also shed light on who was behind the recent spate of street protests, involving students, that brought much public opprobrium against the government. It is also bound to unravel the entire political conspiracy to put the government into difficulty, and, the masterminds involved.
Now that the flames have been doused, and, public life, reportedly, limping back to normal, in Kandy, it is incumbent on the newly appointed Minister of Law and Order to get a firm grip of things and put in motion a foolproof system to ensure no repetition of the kind of incidents that were witnessed during the past week, in parts of the hill capital, in the future. Steps should be taken to establish a rapid deployment force in every police station, in the country, to act swiftly, at the first sign of trouble. It is alleged that delay on the part of the police to act was the main reason for mob violence to escalate. There are lessons to be learned from the Kandy incidents.

Government committed to minimise alcohol consumption
The governments endeavour is to minimise alcohol consumption, State Finance Minister Eran Wickramaratne said in Parliament yesterday.
He was speaking in Parliament yesterday during the second reading of the Excise Amendment Bill.
In 2011-2013, the Excise Bill was amended exempting kithul, palm and coconut toddy tappers from having to obtain a permit. Therefore, there was some difficulty in monitoring the quantity of toddy received by the State distillery. Taking these issues into consideration, now we have made it mandatory to obtain a licence for toddy tapping from all other sources other than kithul. This is also a measure to curtail the illegal distilling, he said.
Wickramaratne refuted allegations levelled against the government recently that attempts were being made to promote alcohol consumption. On the contrary, we intend to reduce the alcohol consumption. Between 2003 and 2005, the gross alcohol consumption was around 2.2 litres. By 2008-2010. it had increased to around 3.7 litres. By 2017, pure alcohol consumption is bound to increase further. We need to take measures to reduce alcohol consumption, he said.
He noted that India and Thailand have a higher percentage of pure alcohol consumption in Asia than that of Sri Lanka.
He said that In Sri Lanka, the consumption of hard liquor is much higher than that of soft liquor. Many people consume illicit liquor and it causes great harm to their health. The Minister noted that the alcohol consumption is reduced to minimise ill health effects.
The Minister said the government intends to reduce the alcohol consumption and its ill effects, but it cannot limit peoples freedom or their basic rights.
Minister Wickramaratne said alcohol consumption cannot be achieved by imposing levies alone.
If we impose greater taxes, the person addicted to alcohol will not suffer but his family. Therefore, what the government can do in this regard is limited and the greater responsibility lies with society and religious leaders. They must educate people about the ill effects of alcohol and influence them in reducing their consumption,the Minister said.
Talking with regard to the levy on teledramas, and films, Minister Wickramaratne said the proposed gazette was presented to minimise the impact that imported teledramas make on the local teledrama and film industry.
The foreign teledrama levy had been revised many a time to safeguard the domestic film and teledrama industry, he said.
Cinema theatres are digitised: Gayantha
The project to digitise the cinema theatres in the country is in progress, Chief Government Whip and Lands and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said.
The Minister said the Mass Media and Information Ministry has commenced introducing the 2K digital technology to the cinema theatres. He added that necessary steps are being taken to prepare a national policy to introduce the digital technology to the cinema theatres.
He said the National Film Corporation are discussing with banks to provide loans for cinema theatres since cost of fixing a digital projector is around Rs. 7 million.
The Minister was responding to a question raised by JVP Parliamentarian Dr.Nalinda Jayathissa during the round of questions for oral answers in Parliament yesterday.
Minister Karunathilake said that according to the Public Administration and Management Ministry, digitising cinema theatres is in progress. The cost of fixing a digital projector in a cinema theatre is nearly Rs.7 million. Since 117 cinema theatres should be converted to digital technology, a large sum of money will have to be spent on the project, Minister Karunathilake said. The owners should digitise the cinema theatres personally.
He added that the country has 173 cinema theatres. Of the theatres, 53 are categorized as 2K, three as 4K and 85 cinema theatres screen films using the technology of which resolution is lower than 2K Minister Karunathilake said.
Thirty two cinema theatres screening films using negatives of 35mm and 117 theatres of them should be converted to digital technology, he said.
Prison inmates have major part in illegal liquor, drugs trade
The trade and use of illegal liquor and drugs could be minimised if inmates of prisons were prevented from handling the racket, UNP Parliamentarian Ajith Mannapperuma said.
He was speaking in Parliament yesterday during the second reading of the Excise Amendment bill.
Mostly the illegal liquor trade is conducted by the inmates in prisons, he said and added that they have the protection and also the communication facilities.
He said heroin, cocaine and cannabis are used abundantly in Sri Lanka. This could be prevented if the Police is empowered by way of a gazette by the Finance Minister, MP Mannapperuma said.
He said the forces render a commendable service to raid cannabis.
The Parliamentarian said the raid on illegal liquor has been stopped because those cases are rejected by the Court. The Police should be given more power to arrest the situation, he said.
Appeal made to allow tapping coconut, Palmyra for toddy
TNA MP S. Sivamohan appealed to the government to allow tapping coconut and Palmyra trees in addition to Kitul Palm for toddy as specified in the Excise Amendment Bill taken up for debate in Parliament yesterday.
According to the Amendment, it was specified that no toddy shall be drawn from any tree other than from Kithul. He said the government had increased the tax for toddy producers from Rs. 600,000 to a million.
You can impose the tax for companies functioning in Colombo or around the big towns but it is not suitable for the cooperatives that depend on toddy tapping from Palmyra and coconut. They are poor people who depend on this industry. Please consider my proposed amendment.
Wherever natural toddy taping is done, cooperative societies should be exempted from the tax. Taxing a million rupees from big companies who import artificial spirits in manufacturing artificial toddy is fair enough.
I am not opposing imposing taxes on big companies, but appealing on behalf of the toddy tappers, he said.
Heated argument erupts in Parliament
Chief Government Whip and JVP Parliamentary Group Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday demanded in Parliament the government to reveal the names of the Parliamentarians who had involved in the Ampara and Digana clashes to Parliament.
He added that according to the Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne, two MPs had involved in the incidents and the 225 MPs have a right to know who those MPs are.
He made the demand during a heated argument erupted yesterday in Parliament when Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam stated that Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansas statement made in Parliament on Wednesday was totally misleading and tends to arouse racism.
Minister Kariyawasm said Wimal Weerawansa stated in Parliament that shops in Kuliyapitiya had been set on fire. Weerawansa also said a Parliamentarian had involved in the incident. MP Weerawansa also said that the MP had got the suspects released by influencing the Police. But it is totally wrong.
The Minister said that only two minor incidents were reported. A glass of a kotthu stall had been damaged and a Parliamentarian had not involved in the incident in any way. Wimals statement arouses racism and it was an attempt to achieve a political mileage.
Joint Opposition member Bandula Gunawardena responding to Kariyawasama queried who was arousing racism. He pointed out that Cabinet Spokesman Minister Rajitha Senarathna had said that two Parliamentarians, two members of a new party and secretary of a MP had involved in the Ampara and Kandy incidents.
MP Gunawardena said Minister Rajitha had said there was a political influence behind these incidents. He said the Joint Opposition had expressed its support to the government to bring the situation under control and to build up reconciliation. Is it correct to imprison the MPs in such a situation MP Gunawardena queried.
UNP MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha stated that he condemned Wimal Weerawansas attempt to ignite the racist conflicts in Kuiyapitiya. Initially it has started in Ampara and Kandy. He said that this was the result of racist seeds sowed by MPs like Wimal Weerawansa and Gammanpila.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that the media reported what Cabinet Spokesman Rajith Senarathne said. He added that according to the latter, two MPs, an organiser of new political party, two members of local government institution, a secretary of an MP had involved in the conflicts.
Minister Rajitha had said that there was a political influence in this incident, Anura Dissanayake said. If there is evidence, it is very clear who has done the crime.The government has to reveal to Parliament today who has done it, he said.
Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena requested the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to protect the rights of the Parliamentarians. He said that there was an attempt to arrest two MPs. He said that following the 83 Black July, the government banned the JVP, Sri Lanka Communist Party and Nawa Sama Samaja Party stating that they had involved in the riot.
The members were arrested and remanded, MP Gunawardena said. But later it was revealed that the UNP had involved in it.
Joint Opposition MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena said the Parliamentarians who work with both Sinhalese and Muslim communities face difficulties in such a situation but not others who deal with a single community. He said that isolated villages of Muslims and Sinhalese should be provided with security without pointing fingers at others.
MP Wimalaweera Dissanayake said the incidents were not organised but ignited following an incident in Ampara. The shops in Ampara were closed yesterday in protest for an arrest of a well known businessman, MP Dissanayake said. The Law should not be misused, he said.
I speaks three times a day with the IGP and other authorities to find out the latest situation, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya stated. He said the CID is investigating the situation.
MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that if there is a CID investigation, a statement has to be made following the investigation report, but not before it. The Cabinet Spokesman had made the statement before the investigation was over, he said.
PCs blamed for not appointing recruited principals
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam complained that the government recruited 4,000 persons for Principal Service Grade 3, but many schools are administered by acting principals for the failure of Provincial Councils to assign them to the needy schools.
He said that those acting principals are teachers.
He added that the Provincial Councils have assigned them to most difficult schools where they are reluctant to serve. The Minister said 278 who obtained the highest marks of the 4,000, have been granted foreign training as well.
He added that he had obtained a Cabinet approval to attach them to schools and had informed the matter to the Public Service Commission, but it has proved a failure since the Provincial Councils have not taken any proper action.
He said that assigning those principals to the schools was beyond his capacity.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said that if the Minister informed him about the matter in writing, he would summon the Governors of the Provinces and discuss the matter to find a positive solution.
Minister Kariyawasasm was responding to a query made by UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri during the round of questions for oral answers.
Do not involve in clashes Rohitha requests Sinhala, Muslim youth
Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeygunawardena requested the Sinhala and Muslim youth not to involve in the clashes since nothing is destroyed but the nation itself in a clash.
He was speaking in Parliament yesterday during the second reading of the Excise Amendment bill.
He said yesterday was the womens day but the situation has worsened to such an extent that the mothers cannot live peacefully in the country.
He said it was the responsibility of the government to bring about a solution to the issue at hand. He added that the then government could resolve the Beruwela issue since there was a leader. But today there is not a leader, MP Abeygunawardena said.
Ceylon Distilleries Corp former employees await justice: Nalinda
The grievances of then employees of Ceylon Distilleries Corporation in 1992 when it was privatised should be addressed even by now, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Parliamentarian Dr. Nalinda Jayathissa yesterday said.
He was speaking in Parliament yesterday during the second reading of the Excise Amendment bill. He said that those employees had been promised to be granted 10 percent of the shares of it. But the decision had not been fulfilled to date, he added.
He said a commission established in 1996 had admitted that those employees had faced an injustice.
I urge the government to do justice to these employees, MP Jayathissa said.

Peoples Insurances GWP up by 10 % to Rs 4.3 bn in 2017
In 2017, Peoples Insurance (PIs) registered a gross written premium (GWP) of Rs. 4,782 million, an increase of 10% over the Rs. 4,340 million reported in 2016.
Underwriting profits for the year touched Rs.172 million, albeit slightly lower than the Rs 206 million reported in 2016. Nonetheless, this is seen as a considerable achievement, making PI one of the very few insurers in the country to consistently record underwriting profits since 2012. Given this track record, PI today stands tall as one of the most profitable non-life insurers in the country, said Chairman, Jehan P Amaratunga.
Meanwhile with PI costs well below the market, PI has been consistently improving its bottom-line performance year on- year. In 2017, profit after tax grew by 17% to reach Rs 773 million, from Rs. 658 million in 2016. PIs assets at December 31, 2017 exceeded Rs. 7.5 billion, of which Rs. 6 billion was attributed to the investment portfolio, an indication of the strength of our financial position.
To spearhead our broader ambitions to tap into the wider non-life insurance market, in 2017, we took a quantum leap to strategically rebrand to a more contemporary brand image that will resonate with the customer of tomorrow.
Leading the rebrand was the launch of a new logo depicting a dynamic and futuristic new look that showcases PIs ambition to be the most trusted non-life insurer in Sri Lanka. Following the launch of our new identity, we began focusing on gradually expanding the non-motor insurance segment to reduce the dependency on captive motor business from the Group. We do realise that this is going to take time. But to accelerate our journey, we began looking at digitisation, to target the needs of new and emerging customer segments through integrated and multi channelled delivery systems. Our focus is to build unique lifestyle and business products for households and small/medium enterprises and corporate respectively.
Being among the few insurers to embrace technology at the onset of the tech buzz, our strategy is to pursue a technology-driven growth platform to position PI as the most innovative and cost-effective insurance service provider for these segments.

Polymath College opens classes for higher education
Polymath College in Nawinna, Maharagama has expanded to offer GEC O-L and A-L education as well.
They also have intentions to introduce university education in the near future. Polymath College have commenced local syllabus as well as British syllabus curriculums.
Principal Upali Gunasekera (former principal of Royal College Colombo) Vice Principal Sudath Liyanagunawardena (former Assistant Principal/Senior Games Master of Royal College Colombo) started the institution with kindergarten and now opened up to advanced level, in Sinhala and English medium as well.
They have taken another bold step to train kids to enjoy a nourishing meal instead of unhealthy instant food. Consultant Nutritionist Dr. Renuka Jayatissa has volunteered to advise the management of Polymath College for this worthy cause. Further, plans are drawn to provide it from school itself.
You will find vegetables, fruits, greens grown all around the school premises, an official from the School said. It is more than a school. They provide additional backing for parents by maintaining a Day Care Centre.
They will take care of your children till 9 pm in all 365 days.
That is a great relief for most of working parents. Kids love to be in the day care center as same as with their parents, probably more. They call the matron mom and most of the kids wish to spend even their holidays with her. It provides evidence for her care and enormous love. This green environment together with the Butterfly Garden indirectly makes kids fall in love with nature. Polymath College is heading for a healthy nation. Our teachers conduct extra classes, preventing parents spend on extra tuition classes.
Tamil, Yoga, Scrabble and Chess are taught in school within the school curriculum. Being a private school, they have the provision & capacity to offer something better than government schools.
They use exclusive methods to maintain healthy relationship with the school and parents. Teachers visit their children twice a year to have a better understanding about the family background. 
 Polymath College honours, encourages, appreciates and respects inventions and innovative ideas as a part of school culture. Polymath College aims to prepare an international personality with Sri Lankan identity.  Polymath means  having learned much in Greek or Universal Man in Latin.

## Title: Powerful career strategies for women
## Supertitle:

Powerful career strategies for women
The general impression is that women are becoming incrementally more successful in the workforce. Women are represented in the workforce in greater numbers than ever and holding a higher percentage of managerial and executive jobs than in the past. Women-owned businesses have doubled in the last dozen or so years.
Here are some strategies women should consider for advancing their careers.
1. Get as much education
and training as you can
Education is by far womens most powerful secret weapon. Get the highest degree you can possibly manage. The old obstacles of lack of money and time need not deter women anymore because many new options for financial aid and distance learning are available.
Consider informal ways of educating yourself through for example joining professional organizations attending conferences and keeping up with trade publications in your field.
To the extent possible when seeking a job look for companies that offer training programs and professional development opportunities. Make a point of asking in job interviews what kind of training is available. Your goal should be to develop a set of portable skills that are transferable and applicable to various career fields.
2. Be a surfer girl
Women are in the majority not only in most realms of higher education but also in Internet use comprising at least 52 per cent of Internet users according to Nielsen/Net Ratings. Women are also more efficient in their Internet use; they spend less time surfing because they know what theyre looking for.
Women are already harnessing the vast amount of information that the Internet puts at their fingertips. Women can stay on the cutting edge through continued dominance on the Internet and by taking advantage of online learning opportunities.
3. Leverage communication and interpersonal skills
Numerous recent studies have noted differences in the way men and women communicate and relate interpersonally. Womens way of communicating is not necessarily better than mens but it may be better suited to newer styles of management. So-called feminine attributes such as the ability to build relationships with customers strike up joint ventures and partner with suppliers are increasingly important.
Generally speaking more women than men are likely to earn the comment plays well with others on their workplace report cards. Women should deploy their strong interpersonal and communication skills at every opportunity and tout their accomplishments in this realm.
4. Plan your career
Career planning is important for everyone but especially for women because they generally have more twists and turns to negotiate along the road to career success than do men. If you have a roadmap youll be less likely to become derailed if you should for example decide to relocate to be with a significant other have a baby or suddenly need to care for an elderly parent.
Decide where you want to be five 10 and 15 years from now. Build flexibility into your career plans to allow for changing circumstances. Your plan may need to change to accommodate those life changes but your core plan will better equip you when that happens.
5. Network
Who are the more successful networkers, men or women You might guess women because women seem like the natural talkers while we tend to think of men as holding back. The facts indicate that men use networking more effectively than women however.
The results of a 1997 study conducted by EnterChange an outplacement and career management consulting firm and reported by Valerie Frazee in Workforce magazine show for example that women are more likely than men to find their next job through an ad in the classifieds while networking is a more effective strategy for men than women. An all-woman networking group can be enormously beneficial to women seeking mentors and contacts whove already succeeded in breaking through the glass ceiling. These groups also can be an efficient way to deal with the time crunch that curtails womens networking. Increasingly women are organizing networks within their own companies often with corporate support.
6. Find a mentor
If you do no other kind of networking at least find yourself a mentor  or let one find you. A mentor is that one person who can guide you help you take you under his or her wing and nurture your career quest.
7. Cultivate and project
confidence
Women often suffer from a crisis of confidence in the workplace especially when the environment is hostile or chilly to them. Confidence wins the top spot every time. You may also get a boost to your confidence from tracking your accomplishments.
8. Self-promote
Once youve shored up your confidence you need to make sure others know how terrific you are. Self-promotion is not easy for women.
Many women are uncomfortable with self-promotion because it flies in the face of societys message that a woman is the support person who is supposed to put other needs ahead of her own. But women need to toot their own horns because they cant depend on others to do it for them.
Make sure people within and outside your workplace know about your accomplishments. Submit news of accomplishments to your company newsletter and local newspaper. Let your boss know what youre up to.

Recollecting the history of the Mustangs Trophy
It may not garner the same anticipation and excitement as the Battle of the Blues three-day encounter but the Mustangs Trophy, the annual 50 overs encounter between Royal College and S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia, has slowly gained its own significance since it is a different brand of cricket and the result inevitable.
It will reach a milestone, in completing a half-century of matches, within the next decade and has created a following of its own, especially among those who prefer to see a more exciting brand of cricket.
The 43rd encounter for the 50-over Mustangs Trophy between Royal and S. Thomas will be played on Saturday 17 March at the SSC grounds.
The tally at present is 20 wins each by the two sides with one tie in the year 2002 and shared in 2012.
It is interesting to note that in the event S. Thomas win this years encounter they would be equalling the five consecutive wins achieved by Royal in the years 1977-81.
While there have been many books dedicated to documenting the history of the three-day game, there have been little or no publications regarding the 50-over encounter.
It is a void that Shantilal Wijesundere, himself an Old Thomian, has attempted to fill with his book titled Royal-Thomian Limited Over Encounters for the Mustangs Trophy 1975-2017 in which he has charted the history of the lesser known Royal-Thomian encounter with exceptional detail.
The book goes beyond just gathering and presenting the scores of all 42 previous encounters that have been played for the Mustangs Trophy, but also carries a description of each encounter, along with the first names of the cricketers and even why a decision was taken to share the trophy in 2012.
It also serves to recall some great names and performances of those who have played in the encounter, some of whom have penned their own memories down in this book.
With the Mustangs Tent - whose members had generously donated a trophy for the encounter - celebrating its centenary year at the three-day encounter in 2018, this book is a timely addition to the collection of Royal-Thomian literature and is a must have for anyone interested in staying in touch with the history of this match.
The book will be on sale at the Big Match and at the Mustangs Trophy match and is priced at Rs. 500/- a copy.
The book was also reviewed favourably by Neil Wijeratne in the newspapers and is available at the STC OBA Secretariat and the Royal College Union office. It could also be purchased from the souvenir shop at the grounds. The proceeds from the sales would go direct to the respective schools to be used for any of their projects.

Record apparel export revenue on the cards
Sri Lanka will have a record export revenue from apparel re exports this year, said Secretary General of the Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) Tuli Cooray.
Speaking after the opening of the international textile and garment expo in Colombo organized by CEMS-Global USA, a multinational exhibition organizer yesterday he said that last year the total revenue earned from apparel exports were US $ 4. 8 billion and so far in 2018 earnings were at US$ 450 million.
Undoubtedly the regaining of the GSP Plus has helped the industry to a great extent. We passed the US$ 4.8 million mark after enjoying GSP plus for around 5 months. However this year we will enjoy the full year of GSP Plus benefits and this will help the industry to achieve an all time record revenue target.
Recording the highest value for the year, earnings from textiles and garment exports continued to increase significantly in December 2017 with increased exports to the European Union (EU) following the restoration of the GSP+ facility in May 2017.
Earnings from garment exports to the EU increased by 27.2 per cent (year-on-year), while garment exports to the USA and other non-traditional markets increased by 18 per cent and 14.1 per cent, respectively, during December 2017.
He said that the apparel industry would see a further boost with the proposed FTA agreements and bilateral arrangements with India and China.
He however said that the local apparel industry is facing major issues with lack of employees and the industry may have to look at several options. One may to import labour and the other would be to make apparels locally and send them to countries like Bangladesh to add the finishing touches.
He also said that 30 years ago there were several talkers for apparel sector jobs that offered a take home pay of around RS. 7,000 and in the 1990s too there were people to fill jobs which paid around Rs. 17, 000 per month. However today even for a Rs. 35, 000 salary there are only a few takers.
Cooray said that today employment have emerged in new sectors like, tourism, ICT, and self employment jobs via the internet and these too have resulted in less turning out for apparel jobs.
He said that labour issues as well as high production costs and lack of workers are prompting some of the local apparel companies to move their factories overseas and this will be a major issue for Sri Lanka the future.

A senior investment advisor attached to the Sampath Securities said that retail market activities in the Colombo Stock Exchange showed signs of improvement yesterday.
This is with the current uncertain situation in some parts of the country retuning to normalcy. The recent sectarian violence, took place in some parts of the island over the last two three days had a profound impact on movement of the stock exchange activities, especially net- foreign purchases particularly on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Turnover dropped notably as volume also declined while a low foreign participation led to a meagre net foreign inflow into the market while All Share Price Index had a downward trend during the same period.
Meanwhile First Capital in their market review said that the secondary market yield curve remained mostly unchanged at previous days levels following yesterdays (8) primary bill auction.

Rugby and the Social responsibility
A poem by Longfellow comes to mind Lives of great men all remind us We can make our lives sublime, And, departing, leave behind us, Footprints on the sands of time When comes such anotherindeed.
At present Rugby in Sri Lanka becoming most interesting game among the schools. There are many academies and clubs working around the country to promote the game. Sri Lanka is producing very promising rugby players every year. Leading schools have many facilities in the game to take part in schools rugby while many of the rural upcoming schools and private schools do not have sufficient facilities to involve with the game.
When the Rugby season comes many schools use to come and watch the game in Colombo hoping to realize the dream one day in their school careers. However, due to huge financial needs during the last decade to date there is no significant improvement in rural and private schools take part in schools rugby tournaments. All good coaches are centred on leading schools. There is no sign of social responsibility addressed by the leading players, clubs and Rugby academies in Sri Lanka.
However, New Zealand and rugby go together like fish and chips, so its hard to imagine a time when the two werent closely linked. Their lives are closely interconnected with the black jercy. Making a meaningful contribution to New Zealand society beyond 80 minutes of rugby is a responsibility New Zealand Rugby takes very seriously. In 2010 and 2011, the rugby community came together to support those affected by the Christchurch earthquakes, including:
 In partnership with Canterbury RFU and their sponsors and partners; free admission to the Canterbury v Wellington ITM Cup match was provided with over 32,000 Cantabrians attending the match
 The All Blacks, individual players and staff provided support to various fundraising and community service campaigns.
 In response to the last February earthquake, New Zealand Rugby launched its first ever direct appeal to rugby fans and supporters around the world on behalf of the children affected by the disaster. The All Blacks Earthquake Appeal for Christchurch Kids directed donations to the two All Blacks official charities, KidsCan Charitable Trust and Plunket New Zealand, to support their work to help the youngest residents of Christchurch and their families as they tried to deal with the aftermath of this tragedy.
Rugby players are community leaders
Their commitment in New Zealand, to do the right thing revolve around the safety and welfare of those involved in the game; backing the Official Charity of New Zealand Rugby and the All Blacks - Cure Kids - to make a difference to New Zealands children battling life threatening illnesses; working with UNICEF, their International Partner for Children.
Opportunities given to schools
Handful of opportunities were given to the community to meet Sevens players, the students mingled with players from South Africa, Argentina, Russia, Spain, Samoa and Wales. There leadership programmes grounded in schools to welcome the Sevens players.
Rugby in Sri Lanka
How many players at school level lagging behind without any motivation to play. Some do not have sufficient financial backup even to find a pair of boots. Nutritional aspects have been neglected in most of the instances.
Those who have sufficient financial backing with the skill move forward in Sri Lankan Rugby. Skilled players in the rural areas do not have better grounds to play hence many injuries are frequent.
However, our players are confident with their inner strength. Sri Lankan rugby has a greater role to play in strengthening the school rugby and especially rural rugby. It should not limit to few schools having every facility to raise their players.
Handful of opportunities are not available for rural rugby teams to participate in international rugby rather it has been a very commercialize profiteering endeavour in Sri Lanka. More politics are involved in this game of strength. Hence, we are not capable of producing international players with a sense of social responsibility.
Players need to understand the importance of grooming the next level of players with a sense of community leadership.
It is the need of the hour to rethink how Sri Lankan players can lead, develop and support people within rugby to be better people and collectively to create socially responsible rugby players, teams, volunteers and experiences.

Secret forest buried beneath sand uncovered
A 7,000-year-old secret woodland has been unearthed after extreme weather battered the UK.
The ancient forest was uncovered as the Beast from the East struck and shifted the sands, just south of Hartlepool in Redcar, Cleveland.
Historic tree stumps and felled logs can now clearly be seen on the shore, but only a stretch of around 400m has emerged.
The rest of the forest, which runs for several miles along the coastline, remains hidden. Hartlepool lifeboatman Garry Waugh, who has lived in the area all his life, said: I last saw the forest when I was ten-years-old.
That was around 40-years-ago.
He continued: There was a school trip and we were taken down to see it, I remember being memorised. Its amazing that this has appeared again. I think it must be because of the weather. The rough seas will have scooped out the sand and the wind will have blown it away.
It is thought the woodland, known as a petrified forest, was first noticed in 1871, and the bones of deer and wild boar have been discovered there. Flint tools and other implements have also been found, suggesting that humans once lived and hunted among the oak, beech, birch and sycamore trees.
The forest existed in the late Mesolithic period, which was a time of hunting and gathering for humans.
It is referred to as a petrified forest as over the years the vegetation has completely turned to stone.

Seylan Bank introduces real-time online payments to customs
Strengthening its drive to offer seamless digital banking solutions, Seylan Bank has enhanced its internet banking facilities to enable its retail and corporate customers to carry out fast, efficient real-time online transactions to the Sri Lankan Customs.
With this enactment, the Bank has eliminated the tedious payment process in the traditional payment system and offer its customers the latest automated end-to-end real-time online payment solutions. Further, the new system also offers great value for money as each online transaction made to the Sri Lanka Customs will only be charged a minimal processing fee of Rs. 50 as opposed to the traditional Cashiers Order fee of Rs.250/-.
Powered by LankaClears LankaPay Online Payment Platform, all payments made through Seylans online banking facilities will be credited directly to Sri Lanka Customs bank accounts in real-time using the LankaPay Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch (CEFTS) platform. CEFTS is a cost-effective, highly-secure electronic payment network and by partnering with CEFTS, Seylan Bank has been able to offer an unparalleled banking experience to its customers with greater convenience.
Commenting on the initiative, Malik Wickramanayake, Deputy General Manager, Operations at Seylan Bank said This is part of a bigger plan at Seylan to bring in technology to empower our Retail & Corporate customers to perform banking transactions by themselves at their own convenience without having to visit a bank branch.
Wickramanayake went onto say that prior to launching this payment solution importers/exporters who maintained accounts at non-state owned banks had to go through a tedious process of having to obtain a cashiers order from their bank, take it to a branch of the two state banks and obtain another pay order with Sri Lanka Customs as the beneficiary.
Seylan Bank has also incorporated latest security updates to ensure that all digital transactions are highly secure and reliable. As a part of its digitalization drive, Seylan Bank is continually evolving with latest technology to transform the traditional payment systems and make a change in the banking industry.

Shikhar Dhawan steers India to victory in lacklustre contest
In a lacklustre contest that failed to live upto a T20 international India secured their first win in the Hero Nidahas tri-nation tournament when they defeated Bangladesh by six wickets at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Bangladesh invited to bat first managed just 139-8 and India knocked the runs off in 18.4 overs with opener and vice-captain Shikhar Dhawan completing his second consecutive half century of the series.
Dhawan and Suresh Raina figured in a third wicket stand of 68 off 54 balls to take India to closer victory after they had lost two wickets for 40.
Raina missed at leg gully by Mehidy at one fell for 28 with the score on 108 giving Rubel Hossain his second wicket of the innings.
Dhawan followed suit at 123 when he holed out to long-on for 55 scored off 48 balls inclusive of five fours and two sixes.
Manesh Pandey (27 n.o.) and Dinesh Karthik (2 n.o.) knocked the required runs off to give India their first points in the tri-series.
Both teams were guilty of not raising the bar with Bangladesh alternating between hits and misses and lacking in direction in their batting and India putting up a sloppy display of fielding spilling three catches all off medium-pacer Vijay Shankar playing in his second T20I. Shankar himself was guilty of dropping a catch off his own bowling while the other two misses at 7 and 8 enabled Liton Das to make 34 off 30 balls and finish as Bangladeshs top scorer.
The only other notable contribution in the Bangladesh innings came from Sabbir Rahman who made 30 off 36 balls.
Despite the dropped catches Shankar who picked up his first wicket in international cricket with the dismissal of Mushfiqur Rahim for 18 and also skipper Mahamudullah for one ended up with figures of 2 for 32 to take the Man of the Match award.
Left-arm fast bowler Jaydev Unadkat also playing in his second T20I took 3 for 38 that included his first wicket in this format when he gave his team the initial breakthrough by dismissing Soumyar Sarkar for 14.
India lost the wickets of skipper Rohit Sharma (17) and Rishabh Pant (7) both bowled in their run chase but with an asking rate of less than seven an over they were never under any kind of pressure.

Singer Industries revenue dips
The revenue of Singer Industries (Ceylon) Plc showed a decrease of 13% from Rs.743 mn to Rs.646 mn, which could be attributed to the reduction of demand for our traditional products lines together with a slowdown of the Sri Lankan economy which was affected by adverse weather conditions in the earlier part.
Nevertheless, it is encouraging to see that the company has recorded approximately 10% of its revenue from washing machine component sales in its first full year, after commencing operations in the final quarter of 2016.
Furthermore, the company ventured into manufacturing of refrigerator components for Regnis (Lanka) PLC during the final quarter of 2017 as a temporary subcontract operation.
In the coming year, two new portable domestic sewing machines are expected to be introduced in order to capture existing market voids and thereby rejuvenate the companys traditional product portfolio.

SLFP will never support racism - General Secretary
SLFP General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said the SLFP as a party will never support any form of racism within the country.
Addressing the media yesterday at the SLFP headquarters, Minister Dissanayake said the incidents in Kandy and several other parts of the country were instigated with the motive of breaking the trust people had in the President and the government.
Some people used one incident to fulfill their mere political motives.I request all the party leaders to act wisely and not to encourage similar politically driven agendas planned to destabilise the country, he said. He said that irrespective of ones religion, all should move forward as one nation.
Minister Dissanayake explained that the social media sites were blocked in an effort to curb extremist hate speech. We intend to find the main suspects and the people who initiated a communal unrest through social media posts and CCTV footage available.We will not let any person who instigates or spreads racism with in the country, he said.
When he was questioned about former President Mahinda Rajapaksas willingness to extend his support to the government to restore normalcy, Minister Dissanayake said there is no point in having discussions after sowing seeds of hatred to create ethnic tension.
Any political party leader can come and talk to the President or the government about the current situation. But the Kandy incident was planned to gain mean political mileage. It is proven in the way how some political leaders speak about the issue, he said.
Minister Dissanayake said the Kandy incident was very well planned to weaken the impression that international communities have on Sri Lanka under the present government.
International communities including the United Nations continued to criticize Sri Lanka for racial discrimination under the former government but the perception began to change after President Maithripala Sirisena took over the position. Now, some political parties are trying to prove that nothing has changed under the present government as well. Their only intention is to destabilise the government, he said.

Sri Lanka Telecom, the national telecommunication service provider entered into a landmark agreement with the University of Peradeniya, one of the top ranked universities in Sri Lanka that is also well known for its cutting edge research, to carry out collaborative ICT research projects as well as to establish a new state of the art R & D centre at Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Peradeniya.
The MoU was signed recently at the University by Prof. Upul B. Dissanayake, Vice Chancellor of the University of Peradeniya and Tilak De Silva, Chief Business Innovation Officer of SLT. This futuristic step was undertaken with the main vision of providing a suitable platform for researchers from a wide variety of disciplines to come together to engage in research and development activities.
Prof. Upul B. Dissanayake, sharing his views on the partnership said, "University-Industry collaboration has been of great importance today more than ever before due to the fast evolving nature of industry as well as industrial practices. This requires intensive use of knowledge as well as research. As a result, high quality human resources become a vital need. This partnership and this research facility will enhance the availability of highly qualified human resources in the areas of R&D within the country.
Speaking on the partnership and the long-term objectives of the initiative, Tilak De Silva, said, "There is a growing need for innovation and development in ICT to match rising world expectations. Further, the rapid development of technology and industry can exert pressure on our graduates to meet the growing demands of the corporate sector, which they could find difficult to meet, due to their lack of exposure.
This landmark agreement will help develop a mutually beneficial framework so that SLT can provide support in the form of material, finance, human resources and testing facilities to the University to conduct research activities.

He said that false and malicious content are spread through social media as anything can be said or spread through social media.
Trolls and bots manipulate social media sites to spread false and inflammatory news in an apparent effort to stoke political and ethnic divisions on a large scale. Hence it is difficult to control social media as news is spread so fast the Minister said.
We needed to block social media temporarily to stop the spread of this malicious and inflammatory news. Now the situation is settling, he added.

Speaker wants religious sectors to speak out against sectarianism
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya while condemning the recent incidents in Kandy and elsewhere, yesterday called upon leaders of all religious sectors to speak out against those who attempt to divide Sri Lanka on sectrarian grounds.
Jayasuriya in a statement said that the sudden surge of violence against Muslims clearly was not representative of any grassroots communal tensions.
These citizens, equal under our law have lived in harmony with their neighbors of other faiths for centuries. Instead, these acts are very clearly the work of those whose political power and machinations are fuelled and fortified by dividing and violating our people, he said.
The full statement: Three years ago, the people of Sri Lanka, of every religious and ethnic affiliation, voted in unison with a resounding majority to expel the evils of racism, bigotry and xenophobic division from our country, to usher in a new era of plurality, peace and civility.
My fellow patriotic Sri Lankans around the world swelled with pride as our country was elevated to the world stage, and held up as the ultimate example of a country that could reverse three decades of terrorist bloodshed into ethnic and communal harmony.
These ideas that formed the platform of the January 8, 2015 revolution were not new ones for our people.
The Constitution of our motherland guarantees freedom, equality, and fundamental human rights to each and every one of our citizens. These protections enshrined by the Constitution are not entitlements, but in the words of our Supreme Law they are the intangible heritage that guarantees the dignity and well-being of succeeding generations of the People of Sri Lanka and of all the People of the World. Every single official elected or appointed to any office in the co-equal legislative, executive and judicial branches of our government swears an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
The sudden surge of violence against Muslims in Kandy and elsewhere in Sri Lanka over the last several days was clearly not representative of any grassroots communal tensions. These citizens, equal under our law have lived in harmony with their neighbors of other faiths for centuries. Instead, these acts are very clearly the work of those whose political power and machinations are fueled and fortified by dividing and violating our people.
The country saw a similar surge of violence against these same citizens in 2014.
I call upon leaders of all religious sectors to speak out against those who attempt to divide Sri Lanka on sectarian grounds, and to condemn in the strongest terms all those who resort to intimidation, thuggery and violence to incite religious or racial tensions among innocent citizens. We must stand together and speak with one powerful voice to drown out the menace of bigotry. On the road to peace, I ask our leaders to recall the words of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, who said Peace is not unity in similarity, but unity in diversity, in the comparison and conciliation of differences. We cannot make room for belligerence and brutality.
I call upon the government, members of the House of Parliament, and the independent judiciary, to recall our sworn solemn duty  to protect the rights of all our citizens enshrined in the Constitution. It is of paramount importance that we take all necessary measures to protect those citizens affected by violence and threats of violence. We must give them the sense of safety and security to which they are entitled as Sri Lankans. We must ensure that our justice system turns its attention to those whose racist machinations are aimed at dragging our country back into darkness just to further their own selfish political ends.
Today, the media is free to report independently on the ground reality. Today, we will not stand idly by.
Today, the police and armed forces will not stand idly by while they terrorize innocent citizens of any ethnic or religious stripe. Today, it is their turn to be afraid, as the full might of the law descends on them and their co-conspirators, the statement adds.

## Title: The spectre of populism

The spectre of populism
The shambles left by last weekends Italian election, the chaotic dysfunction of American government under President Trump, and the attack on liberal democratic institutionsin Hungary, Poland, Turkey and elsewhere  all of these are being blamed on the haunting spectre of populism.
But is populism the villain here Do we even agree on what the word means
This is more than an abstract debate. How we respond to what most certainly is a crisis of liberal democracy depends a great deal on how we understand the reaction thats aggravating it.
A purely negative verdict on populism is especially prevalent among elites. But Id argue that while authoritarian forms of populism are dangerous and must be resisted, other forms can contribute to democracys well-being.
Further, too much focus on populism itself risks mistaking the symptom for the cause. Angry dissidence doesnt arise by accident. It is typically a response to genuine failures and injustices. The best way to combat the populists excesses is to deal with the discontents to which they give voice.
The election in Italy offers instruction both on what we need to fear and on the costs of leaving problems to fester.
On the one hand, it is worrying that the opportunistic Five Star Movement and the far-right, anti-immigrant League party (formerly the Northern League) were seen as the two main victors with 32.2 percent and 17.7 percent, respectively. Both are sympathetic to Russia, could prove disruptive to the European Union and lack a coherent approach to the countrys finances.
But the Leagues strong showing owed in part to a rebellion among conservative Italians against the re-emergence of Silvio Berlusconi, the discredited 81-year-old former prime minister, as the chief centre-right figure. Exceeding expectations, the League bested Berlusconis party to become the principal force on the right.
And for all its opportunism, Five Star swept southern Italy by speaking to the regions frustration with its economic marginalization over many decades, the persistence of corruption and the continuing influence of organized crime.
The incumbent centre-left Democrats were routed. Although they narrowly outpolled the League with 18.9 percent, they lost a quarter of their electorate. The League, by contrast, quadrupled its share. The Democrats deserved better than they got, having run a rather effective government that restored economic growth. But their leader, former prime minister Matteo Renzi, squandered his popularity on a misguided constitutional referendum and split his party by pushing aside some of its traditional figures. (Memo to Democrats in the United States: Sectarian infighting is not conducive to a partys health.)
The bottom line: Yes, there was a backlash against immigration, but above all, Italians were furious at politicians of the old parties and disheartened over the long-term economic decline of their country. Populism may well get Italy into a lot of trouble, but its not hard to see why Italians are sick of what theyve had. Elites need to pay attention.
The sharpest critique of populism, articulated well by Princeton Universitys Jan-Werner Muller, is that in defining the people, populists often exclude large segments of the population. They treat their political opponents as enemies of the people and seek to exclude them altogether. These dangers are captured in the titles of two important new books, one by my Brookings Institution colleague William Galston, Anti-Pluralism: The Populist Threat to Liberal Democracy; the other by Harvard University scholar Yascha Mounk, The People vs. Democracy.
The sort of populism Muller describes is indeed a threat to liberal values. For their part, Galston and Mounk in no way overlook the sources of disaffection that have led to populist advances. They take seriously the urgency of easing the social and economic crises that provoked the current upsurge.
Nonetheless, there should be no denying that other populist traditions (Id insist that the American brand from the 1890s is one of them) maintain faith with democracy, push ruling elites to face up to injustices that undermine free institutions and create the mass movements that social change requires.
The historian Richard Hofstadter was a critic of the populists, yet in his classic 1955 book The Age of Reform, he recognized that ruling classes can be pushed in two quite different directions. One of the primary tests of the mood of a society at any given time, he wrote, is whether its comfortable people tend to identify, psychologically, with the power and achievements of the very successful or with the needs and sufferings of the underprivileged.
Populism takes root when those in charge reject the second option.

139th Battle of the Blues:
Thomians favoured but expect a close game
The 139th Battle of the Blues three-day contest between Royal College and S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia will unfold with the usual comradeship at the SSC grounds with the Thomians holding a slight edge over their opponents due to their recent purple patch leading upto todays encounter.
This match is played for the prestigious D. S. Senanayake Memorial Shield. Incidentally, D. S. Senanayake, who became the first Prime Minister of independent Ceylon, donned the Thomian cap in 1901 and 1902. This shield was first presented in 1928. If a match is drawn then the school already holding the shield retains it. Royal College are the current holders of the shield after winning the 137th Battle of the Blues in 2016, and drawing the 138th Battle of the Blues the following year.
Three days of exciting cricket can be expected from these two major schools with Royal trying hard to turn tables on the Thomians and retain the shield which they won in 2016 under the captaincy of Geeshath Panditharatne.
Of the 138 matches played so far Royal leads the tally with 35 wins while the Thomians have won on 34 occasions and 69 matches have ended in draws.
The Thomians last won the Battle of the Blues under the leadership of Ashan Peiris in 2007. They are led this year by all-rounder Dellon Peiris and have registered six outright wins this season and are unbeaten.
We are going into this game as favourites and along with my team mates we will play positive cricket to bring the shield back to Mount Lavinia which has eluded us for the past 11 years, said Thomian captain Peiris.
Veteran cricket coach Dinesh Kumarasinghe handling the Thomians this year said, We have a balanced team and done well to secure six outright wins and remain unbeaten. But when it comes to a Royal-Thomian, its a totally different game since its played over three days. Unfortunately we could not win the game last year due to bad weather. This time we are going out in a positive manner to create a win for the college.
Highest run getter for the Mount Lavinia boys right hander cum middle order batsmen Maneesha Rupasinghe has scored nearly 700 runs this season. Top order batsmen right hander Manthila Wijeratne (former St.Sebastian College Moratuwa cricketer), has also shown great form scoring over 600 runs with some impressive knocks while wicket-keeper and left hand top order batsman Sithara Hapuhinna, has aggregated nearly 600 runs among the others. S Thomas will also look to right-hander Kishan Munasinghe together with left hander Dulith Gunaratne both of whom have scored over 400 runs and right hander Shalin De Mel nearly 400 runs.
Spinners Shannon Fernando together with Dellon Peiris have been lethal throughout the season taking over 125 wickets between them along with Sri Lanka under 19 player Kalana Perera, Thevin Eriyagama and Pavith Ratnayake (the trio having taken close to 85 wickets) are expected to bowl the Thomians to victory. Royal who had a mixed season recording six outright wins and one outright loss will be led by top order batsmen Pasindu Sooriyabandara.
The big match is a totally different game to other matches which you play. We are going into this match as the underdogs, so together with all my team mates we are hoping to play good cricket and try our best to keep the trophy at Reid Avenue. where I was part of that match winning teem of 2016 scoring a debut century said Sooriyabandara.
Royal coach Thilina Kandamby was confident of his team performances. We have a very young side and we go out as underdogs. We have won six games outright this year due to us having a balanced side.
The team is willing to give of their best in this big game, Kandamby said. Royal could boast of many bowlers who have performed extraordinarily this season, as their bowling department also has clicked very well as a team with left-arm spinner Manula Perera heading the honours list with over 85 wickets.
Both Right arm medium paceman Lahiru Madusanka and Bimal Wijesekara too have enjoyed a good time with the ball capturing nearly 35 wickets. There is also plenty of variety in the Royal spin department with Kamil Mishara the off spinner capturing 50 plus wickets together with left-arm chinaman of Gayan Dissanayake, who has over 25 wickets under his belt.
The pillars of the Royal batting are Sooriyabandara who leads the batting as the highest run scorer for them this season with 1200 runs, vice captain and left hander Kavindu Madarasinghe (who is also the wicket keeper) and Kamil Mishara both having scored close to 750 runs.
The other top scorers are Tharindu Senaratne close to 700 runs along with the two openers right hander Bhagya Dissanayake and left hander Gayan Dissanayake both scoring over 600 runs.
They will be expected to make their contributions to bolster the Royal scoreboard.

Tribute to Sri Lankan women
Chris Burgess, an international photographer associated with many leading hollywood blockbuster movies such as Gladiator, Batman Begins, Band of Brothers, Harry Potter and Star Wars: The Force Awakens amongst others, recently joined forces with local Cause Marketing Agency Vision1 and ethical fashion label STHRI by Selyn to collaborate on an empowerment passion project in tribute to the Sri Lankan woman.
In celebration of International Womens Week, the collaboration launched a special online photo gallery - "STHRI, that celebrates diversity; a project executed with the goal of inspiring and uplifting women across the island to take pride in themselves without conforming to superficial social norms. The online exhibition consists of portraits of women and girls of all religions, ethnicities, ages, shapes, social backgrounds and communities who volunteered to be a part of the campaign and spread the message of self-love.
The project was inspired when Burgess noticed a recent whirl of derogatory advertisements that objectify women and perpetuate superficiality in the eyes of the local audience. From digital advertisements to billboards, some brands take the phrase any publicity is good publicity too much to heart. However, these controversial campaigns didnt go unspoken about  social media users have begun to stand together and rally against the sexism thats easily dismissed in a predominantly patriarchal nation.
Married to a Sri Lankan and raising their daughter in Colombo, the current discriminatory gender-toxic environment in the country doesnt sit quite well with Chris. My mother brought my two brothers and sister up while working as a full time Sister in a large hospital specializing in cancer in children. I always admired her strength and warmth. I'm especially sensitive to the underpinning of women in advertising and the workplace. I'm also married to a talented, strong woman and my daughter is growing up in a household that encourages free spirited thinking. There is a movement right now of equality and it's up to us to carry that torch for the next generation. We're moving forward in attitude and understanding that we as humans are capable of anything and not limited to gender specific roles, Burgess said.
He pitched his interest in changing the narrative to Vision1 who spearheaded the creative idea and introduced Chris to Selyn Handlooms, one of Sri Lankas only Fair Trade guaranteed organisations known for its woman-power practices. The ethical brand founded with the philosophy of womens empowerment recently introduced a sub-brand, Sthri, an empowered fashion collective that benefits disadvantaged rural women.
The empowerment exhibit will be launched on International Womens Day along with a bold, inspirational social media video featuring the volunteer models. The projects intention is to spread the message that being yourself unapologetically is the best version of you. The gallery can be viewed at www.sthri.com.

## Title: Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un to meet 'as soon as possible'

Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un to meet 'as soon as possible'

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has invited Donald Trump to meet him, an unprecedented overture which the US leader has said he will accept.
The shock announcement was made by senior South Korean officials in Washington, who passed on a letter from the North Korean leader.
They said Kim had also agreed to halt nuclear and missile tests and was "committed to denuclearisation".
It appears to be a major breakthrough after months of threats and violence.
However analysts warn that such summits are usually the result of years of careful diplomacy so remain sceptical about what these rapidly arranged talks can achieve.
Trump said the development was "great progress" but that sanctions will remain in place until a firm agreement is reached.
North Korea has not yet issued any official comment on the week's developments.
South Korean National security adviser Chung Eui-yong, speaking outside the White House after the meeting, said: "I told President Trump that at our meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he's committed to denuclearisation."
He added: "President Trump appreciated the briefing, and said he would meet Kim Jong-un by May to achieve permanent denuclearisation."
How did we reach this point
North Korea has been isolated on the international stage for decades because of its well-documented human rights abuses and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws.
What has North Korea actually pledged
There are four main things:
Kim is prepared to sit down with the US president
It is "committed to denuclearisation"
It will halt all nuclear and missile tests
It understands that US-South Korean military drills "must continue".
It is important to note that North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely. It also remains unclear exactly what it is asking for in return.
The North has halted missile and nuclear tests during previous talks before, only to resume when it lost patience or felt it was not getting what it demanded.
The last point is also significant. The US has had tens of thousands of military personnel in South Korea since the end of the Korea War. The massive annual joint war games infuriate the North, because it believes they are preparation for invasion.
They were due to take place during the Olympics but have been suspended for now.
Is this a victory for Trump
Trump has repeatedly belittled Kim Jong-un, and last year threatened him with "fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen before" if he continued to threaten the US. He has at times said there is no point in talking to North Korea.
But Chung made a point of saying it was Trump's "maximum pressure policy" which had brought the parties to this point.
Christopher Hill, formerly the US negotiator with North Korea, told the BBC Trump may have frightened Pyongyang by "looking at options that many American presidents would not have gone for".
But he has also shown flexibility to meet people other presidents might have dismissed, he says.
Our correspondent in Seoul says Kim Jong-un has also scored a propaganda win, first with the Olympics and now by being seen to reach out to the US.
What about the other major players
The South's statement also credited "international solidarity" for reaching this point.
That is likely in part a reference to international sanctions, which have increased with each North Korean show of force.
China, North Korea's main economic supporter, has in recent months toughened up its dealings with the North, including on key areas like petroleum and oil. This is thought to be putting a major strain on the North.
It has consistently pushed for all parties to talk so will welcome this development.
Japan, which saw North Korean missiles fly over its territory twice last year, is routinely distrustful of Pyongyang's motives, saying it must commit to giving up its weapons before any talks can take place.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed news of a Trump-Kim meeting, but said: "We will keep putting maximum pressure until North Korea takes concrete actions toward denuclearisation."
Have talks like this happened in the past
No sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader, but there have been repeated attempts to get North Korea to denuclearise.
The last major effort - the Six Party talks - collapsed in 2008, largely because North Korea refused to allow inspectors to verify that it had shut down its nuclear programme.
A number of bids to restart the talks also collapsed, including in 2012 when North Korea launched another rocket, two weeks after announcing a "leap day" agreement with the US.
Where might these talks happen
Kim Jong-un is under a range of travel sanctions, so his options are limited. It is thought to be unlikely that Trump would go to North Korea.
They could meet in the demilitarized zone - the border between the North and South - or more likely, China will host them.

WHO, UNFPA condemn recent communal violence
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) jointly echoed the statement issued by the United Nations in Sri Lanka earlier, regarding the recent incidents of communal violence, by jointly condemning these actions in the strongest possible terms.
According to the statement, particularly in relation to the Ampara incident, which stemmed from inaccurate information relating to reproductive health, the joint statement by the WHO and UNFPA was released to clarify misconceptions.
The UN Resident Coordinator and WHO Representative in Sri Lanka Dr. Razia Pendse said: There is no medication or pills currently known or available that can permanently make a human being sterile. The information on the use of an infertility pill or sterilization pill mixed with food is baseless with no scientific evidence, the statement said.
In the same statement, UNFPA Representative in Sri Lanka, Ritsu Nacken, stated that the need to ensure increased access to accurate reproductive health information, especially among youth, is so apparent. Wrong information on reproductive health is being used to ignite hatred and create tensions between ethnic communities. This should not and cannot happen.
Together with the United Nations, the WHO and UNFPA urge authorities and all citizens to ensure that action is taken to counter misinformation and to ensure that the rule of law is upheld, human rights are protected, and security is ensured for all, the statement said.

Woman empowered
After nearly 110 years of the very first observance of a Women's Day in New York, it is being celebrated world over now every year. International bodies, governments, women's organisations, community groups, and even businesses and charities rally together to mark the occasion with many varieties of activities - all with the good intention of promoting the well-being, security and the progress of women throughout the world. The Day also highlights the achievements of women, and acts as a catalyst to cause positive changes in the lifestyle of women globally. Sri Lanka is no exception, with many kinds of activities taking place today.
As usual, Women's Day activities will include talks and discussions, seminars and workshops, rallies and other performances and many more of them. The focus of all those activities will be on or around poverty, gender parity, education, unemployment, domestic violence and on similar issues related to women.
No doubt they are of great importance for the well-being and the uplift of the status of any woman - young or matured. But compared with the issue of early marriages and teenage pregnancy of women, they all become secondary and less important, due to the harm and the damage caused to the entire future life of a young woman through both these calamities, which are massive, irrevocable and devastating.
Early marriage and teenage pregnancy
In developing countries like our own Sri Lanka, early marriage and teenage pregnancy are the main cause of death for girls between 15 and 19 years during childbirth, due to complications. Early marriage also threatens the health of both the mother and the child. Young girls also experience the risk of delivering pre-term or having a low birth weight baby. Infant mortality rates are 60% higher with young mothers, and the infant born tends to have a weaker immune system and faces a heightened risk of malnutrition.
On a day, when attention is paid to the issues of women globally, it is very pertinent to address the major issue of early marriages and teenage pregnancy facing young women from around the world. While so many research and survey reports are available covering these two top issues of young women, International Centre for Research on Women (ICRW) reveals the following daring information vis--vis developing countries:
 One third of the girls are married before the age of 18 and 1 in 9 are married before the age of 15.
 In 2012, 70 million women had been married before the age of 18.
 If present trends continue, 150 million girls will be married before their 18th birthday over the next decade. Thats an average of 15 million girls each year.
Future generations
The World Health Organization states that an estimated 140 million girls will become child brides between 2011 and 2020; girls who marry before age 18 are typically denied an education, at risk of complications related to premature childbearing, and more vulnerable to intimate partner violence. According to the Family Health Bureau of the Ministry of Health, 6.5% of the total pregnancies registered in 2010 in Sri Lanka were teenage pregnancies.
A community based comparative study on Risk factors for teenage pregnancies conducted in Colombo, Anuradhapura and Batticaloa from December 2010 to April 2011, by a team of high profiled medical experts has recommended that Comprehensive Reproductive Health Education can undoubtedly help abate the number of teenage pregnancies in Sri Lanka, and ensure safer, healthier lives for future generations. Such effective preventive programmes could be the solution, to influence the occurrence of early marriage and teenage pregnancies among young women in the vulnerable areas of the country.
It is in the above context that a groundbreaking mega project is being aptly launched today by the Family Planning Association of Sri Lanka (FPA Sri Lanka) in the BOI region in Seethawaka (Avissawella) to provide the required comprehensive reproductive health knowledge and services, primarily, to the young female workers employed in the various work places of the region. Seethawaka has been selected, apparently, in view of the findings through the said comparative study carried out in Colombo.
Through the Seethawaka Project, FPA expects to expose both young male and female workers in the BOI region to seminars, workshops, training as well as community and peer group discussions on various aspects of reproductive health issues, aimed at doing away with early marriages and teenage pregnancies by the young people.
The cooperation of the managements of all worksites in the region has been guaranteed to the FPA Sri Lanka.

Written all over her face: Meghan rated the most perfect royal beauty
A HARLEY Street surgeon has rated Meghan Markle the most perfect royal beauty by using a facial mapping technique invented in ancient Greece.
Human faces that closely follow the ratio are often considered more attractive.Cosmetic surgeon Julian De Silva applied the principle to photographs of Meghan, 36, the Duchess of Cambridge, Zara Phillips and princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.
By measuring the distances between eyes, eyebrows, nose, lips, chin and jaw and dimensions of their facial shape, he found Prince Harrys fiance closest to the Greek ideal of perfection with a score 87.4 per cent accurate to the golden ratio.
De Silva, who runs the Centre For Advanced Facial Cosmetic and Plastic Surgery in London, said: Meghan and Kate both really stood out and got significantly higher marks than the three others.
Meghan has beautiful facial symmetry and gets closer than any other princess to having what the Greeks considered the perfect face.
She has an almost perfectly shaped nose with a 98.5 per cent score, her eye position is exactly right and her gorgeous V-shaped chin is far more classically beautiful than Kates.
Kate stands out for having a perfect gap between her nose and lips and very strong eye spacing.
Meghans score was a few points behind the most perfect female celebrity  Johnny Depps ex-wife Amber Heard, with 91.85 per cent.The highest-scoring male celebrity was George Clooney with 91.86 per cent.
Meanwhile, Meghan and Harry were said yesterday to be the royals most in tune with the British public.
Half of the 2,300 people questioned believed that since marrying Prince William she had been moulded into someone else.
