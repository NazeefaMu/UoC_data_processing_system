More Qatar investors  eye Sri Lanka
Sri Lankas economy is stable and many investors are keen on starting businesses in Sri Lanka, Doha Bank Group CEO, R. Seetharaman said.
Speaking at a press conference in Colombo yesterday he said that they too saw this potential and decided to open a representative office in Sri Lanka.
Many Qatari and GCC businessmen are planning to enter the growing Sri Lankan market ever since peace was restored, He said with the opening of this office they could promote inter regional trade through their globe banking network.
The bank is also working to organise several business-to-business and business-to-government meeting to discuss joint ventures.
He also said that Doha Bank is the first bank from the Gulf region to open in Sri Lanka and there are similar investments to follow. He said the US$ 400 million credit line is currently available and this too will be increased in the future.
We want to create a good brand image and then we will open a regional office in Sri Lanka.
Commenting on the economic sanctions imposed in Qatar he said that the country has now got over it and they are implementing a different model. Our Doing Business Index too has improved.
In Sri Lanka too, total foreign ownership is permitted for investment in most of the areas of the economy and there is no restriction on foreign exchange transactions relating to current account payments. This too is a major plus point for foreign investors.
He said that the current trade volumes of both Sri Lanka and Qatar are very low and is less than US$ 90 million. In contrast Indian ($1billion) and Bangladesh ($1.5 million) trade volumes are very high. These sanctions have given a good opportunity for Sri Lankans to take advantage of relax rules and regulations to invest in Qatar.
Meanwhile Ambassador to Sri Lanka in Qatar A.S.P. Liyanage too endorsing this said that this is the time to begin business ventures with Qatar as their investment landscape is very attractive.
He said that he was happy that he too could also play a major role to facilitate the opening of the Doha Bank in Colombo. He said that he also negotiated for the LULU group in the Gulf to open in Sri Lanka and soon they will launch a major farmer fruit and vegetable buyback programme.
The Doha Bank representative office would be opened at World Trade center said Chief Representative Officer, Sri Lanka, Eranda weerakoon.

New mindset required to  do business with China
Sri Lanka should come up with proactive regulatory measures in trade and investment by the Sri Lankan government to give a further flip, to existing trade and investment ties between Sri Lanka and China.
Minister of Economic and Commercial Office-Embassy of the Peoples Republic of China of Sri Lanka, Yang Zuo emphasised these views speaking at a seminar held under the theme, Enhancing Exports to China and Attracting Investment.
The event was organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in Colombo.
Speaking on marketing opportunities in China and entry strategies, the Minister Yuan stressed that relevant authorities in the Sri Lankan tourism industry need to come up with a potential marketing strategy to promote burgeoning the Sri Lankan tourism industry among Chinese travellers to better garner set targets of the industry.
They havent heard much about tourism in Sri Lanka; but there is a large potential market, waiting to be explored. Chinese tourists might want to go to the Maldives since the country is known as a preferred tourism destination in the Asian region.
Over the years, purchasing power and the consumption of Chinese nationals have increased at a faster pace over the last two-three decades, and they prefer to pay a premium price when it comes to purchasing high quality, personalised products. If Sri Lankan companies wish to cater to the Chinese market, it is essential for them to set higher standards for their products, to cater to the changing and diverse requirement of Chinese consumers, Minister Yuan stressed.
With a large population, China holds a huge market; nevertheless, there is a shortage of Sri Lankan goods and services, exported to China.
In recent years, more and more Chinese companies have expressed their willingness to invest in Sri Lanka, the Minister Yuan said adding that the Chinese government is willing to provide necessary support for promising Sri Lanka investors to create much-needed business links with Chinese counterparts as well as to help expand their footprint in the Chinese market through business partnerships.
In 2017, two-way trade between the two countries have reached USD 4.4 billion, while tourist arrivals from China to Sri Lanka reached 270,000 marks, contributing largely to the development of the Sri Lankan tourism sector.
Underscoring the need to explore potential products and services that can be exported to the Chinese market, he said that it is essential to implement speedy measures to create a good impression about Made in Sri Lanka products among Chinese consumers.
Potential products from Sri Lanka to China are apparel, coconut, tea, natural rubber, cinnamon, fruit, nuts, edible plants, pepper, and frozen fish and many more.

50 Greatest Players in World Cup History:
#22 Socrates
14TH JUNE 1982ESTADIO RAMON SANCHEZ PIZJUAN, SEVILLE
The atmosphere inside the Pizjuan was pregnant with disappointment. They'd heard so much about this Brazil team. They were supposed to be the antithesis of the dull sides of 74 and 78 - teams that had been filled with thugs and ruffians, sides that kick-by-punch knocked back the legacy of the great 70 team into the deepest recesses of memory. And yet... the Soviet Union had scored early on thanks to an absolutely farcical error from their comical goalkeeper Waldir Peres. Easily the better team at that point, they were holding off the men in canary yellow with ease; a doughty, hardened bunch of veterans standing firm in front of arguably the best goalkeeper in the world at the time, Rinat Dasayev.
Brazil were going to need something spectacular to break this lot down. Enter, stage far left, their captain.
With barely a quarter of an hour to go, receiving the ball some forty yards out after a scrambled half-clearance from the Soviets, he dropped a shoulder to evade a desperate lunge before dropping another to send another red-shirt scrambling to the wrong fire. With space in front of him, he looked up, thirty yards out, and absolutely leathered one. The brilliant Dasayev got a hand to it, but there was no stopping it.
Scrates had arrived.Brazil were back.
We had to deal with the anxiety of being behind for most of the game, Scrates remarked, as quoted in the excellent Doctor Socrates by Andrew Downie. We tried everything to get near the Russian goal. A sure defence and a magnificent goalkeeper looked like they would stop us from making our dream come true. And then the ball fell to me. There was a wall of red shirts ready to spill their own blood to stop me. I feinted to shoot and jinked to the right. A space opened up. I feinted again and an even bigger space appeared. I put everything I had into my shot. And the scream came: Goooallll. No, not a goal. An endless orgasm. It was unforgettable.
12TH JUNE 1986ESTADIO JALISCO, GUADALAJARA
The biggest match Nigel Worthington had been involved in before taking the flight to Mexico had been his debut. It'd been 2 years ago when Northern Ireland took on Wales in the last ever British Home Championship and drew them 1-1. It was a point that allowed them to keep the trophy in perpetuity.
Having qualified for Mexico 86 they'd put up a superb fight against the talented - but underachieving - Spaniards in their opener. This, though, was something else.
This was Brazil.This was Scrates.
Worthington didn't play that day, but it's his words that give meaning to just what that entailed.
Were all lined up on either side of the tunnel, the nerves are going and youre looking across at these Brazil players, who all look like such fantastic athletes, and youre thinking, This is going to be tough, Worthington told the Telegraph. And then I noticed Scrates just leaning with his elbow against a wall smoking a cigarette. This is like five minutes before kick-off. Were there thinking, Weve got our work cut out here and Scrates is just stood there, casual as you like, puffing away, looking like he didnt have a care in the world. Still to this day, I can picture that scene in my mind.
When youre going into a big World Cup game and youve got the audacity to stand in the tunnel smoking a cigarette moments before kick-off youve got to say youre some player.
***
To separate Scrates the player and Scrates the person would be to commit a cardinal sin - the player who belted that opener in against the Soviets, and the man who stood in the tunnel languidly sipping on a ciggy were one and the same.
It's what made him... him.
It'd be criminal to view him merely as the player who captained arguably the most loved football team of all time. It would be to take away from the man who delayed his entry into the Selecao so as to pursue, and complete, a degree in medicine. From the man who convinced his club-mates to vote on every decision they made from transfer to bathroom breaks, a concept called Democracia Corithiana, alien in the dictatorial landscape of Brazilian football. From the man who pressurised the military junta into conducting municipal elections for the first time in nigh on two decades. From the man who loved a cold beer more than anything else. From the man who knew that football was just a game... to be enjoyed, to be loved, to be lived.
He was, though, some player.
A tall, lean man, with flowing locks and a beard to die for, Scrates did what he wanted on the football pitch, and he did it better than most anyone else. He counteracted his inability to turn quickly by perfecting the backheel... he was so good at it that Pele once remarked that he could play better going backwards than most players could going forwards. He didn't do anything as uncouth as sprinting, but his long, easy, strides allowed him to cover ground far faster than most. And as he showed against the Soviets, he could belt them with his right foot... but it was an instrument that could cajole as well as it could hammer and he could pick a pass out with uncanny precision.
His team, Tele Santana's team, played football without boundaries, without limitations, without fear. You could call it naive, we prefer to call it beautiful.
The Doctor, though, called his team's style of play organised chaos
Everyone has the freedom to play how they wish as long as they perform certain basic functions. As amazing as that might seem, it works. It comes  from improvisation, but also from the knowledge that was acquired in two years of working together, he said. I play on the wing, I am a center-forward, a sweeper, holding midfielder  it depends on how the game is going. Even if we dont win the title, well have altered the traditional schemes of 4-2-4 and 4-3-3 and whatever else they have invented.
And they had.
Systems, tactics, statistics fell by the wayside as the 80s Brazil side one-touch passed and nutmegged their way to footballing folklore.
In 82, after Scrates inspired the comeback against the USSR, Brazil swept aside all comers till they met the excellent Italians and their on-fire striker Paolo Rossi... needing only a draw, they attacked like naive schoolchildren and were punished for it. Not one of them regretted it, though.
In 86, Scrates wasn't at the level he'd been at four years previously, but he was still majestic, helping Brazil to the quarters... where they lost to France on penalties. The Doctor saw his one-step lazy-flick (something his dad had warned would get him in trouble the day he became a professional, but something he continued with as a matter of principle) saved easily by Joel Bats in the French goal. Most people would have been devasted (picture Robbie Baggio and that cry of agony), he just shrugged and got on with it.
After all, it's just a game.
In the end, they - and he - won the square root of jack all, but he'd showed the world that sometimes it's not the results that matter. Sometimes it's not about who wins or who loses.
Sometimes it's about how you do it.
For that, for leading from the front and living the philosophy he constantly espoused, for being the single coolest man to have kicked a football around... Doctor Scrates eases into our list of 50 Greatest Players in World Cup History with a cold one in hand. sk

Airtel, World Vision hold awareness  program for students
Airtel and World Vision Lanka are holding a series of online safety awareness drives for school teachers and principals in the Batticaloa District.
Under this initiative, over 6,000 O/Level and A-Level students in the region will be reached through teacher training programs. Airtel, World Vision Lanka aims to spur advocacy by introducing visual tools at schools to make an ongoing difference.
With online penetration amongst children growing exponentially, its negative effects also are scaling up. According to Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SLCERT), the number of social media incidencesincluding suicide attempts due to cyber exploitation, bullying and violence among the student populationhad grown by 300% from 2011 to 2017. Some of them have ended with children taking the extreme step of ending their lives.
By empowering students to build a positive digital footprint, Airtel is allowing students to control their actions online and be a positive influence on others.
The telco believes that teachers need additional training to help students be kind and positive citizens online just as they do in the physical world.
The internet service provider is also encouraging a safe environment for youths to report cases of cyberbullying and other forms of online abuse within their institutions; and to seek out support through existing local law enforcement and non-government entities. 
Bharti Airtel Lanka CEO and MD Jinesh Hegde, said, We want students to be educated, empowered, and engaged in changing the online environment for the better. Its clear that the internet is having a positive impact on how young people learn, interact with each other and express themselves.
We hope to use this unique opportunity to collectively promote respect and empathy online, inspire young people to harness their enthusiasm, creativity and support them to build positive online experiences for everyone.
Commenting on the programme, Dr. Dhanan Senathirajah, National Director of World Vision Lanka stated, With the internet constantly evolving, we believe that adolescents must stay abreast of all the dangers that threaten them. Whether its exposure to strangers on gaming systems, on social networking sites, or on mobile devices, they need to know these dangers and what actions to take in order to prevent them.

Women's Twenty20 Asia Cup in Malaysia:
Bismah Maroof, Nida Dar star in crucial Pakistan win
KUALA LUMPUR, Wednesday - Bismah Maroof's unbeaten half-century and a career-best 5/21 from Nida Dar helped Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by 23 runs in the Women's Twenty20 Asia Cup on Wednesday in Kuala Lumpur.
After being asked to bat by Sri Lanka, Pakistan, spurred by captain Maroof's 41-ball 60 not out and Nahida Khan's 38 in 34 balls, put up a competitive total of 136/4.
In reply, Sri Lanka could only manage 113/9 in their quota of overs as off-spinner Dar led the demolition job. There were two run outs in the Sri Lanka innings, while Maroof picked up the other wicket.
Dar took out three of the top five Sri Lanka batters  Yasoda Mendis (25) and Nipuni Hansika (24), the openers, as well as Anushka Sanjeewani (11). When Sanjeewani was dismissed after being caught by Anam Amin, Sri Lanka were 67/3 in 12 overs, needing a further 70 runs off 48 balls.
Pakistan effected two run outs thereafter, of Hasini Perera and Rebeca Vandort, and Maroof chipped in with the wicket of Oshadi Ranasinghe to reduce their opponents to 86/6 in the 16th over, a position from which Sri Lanka could not recover.
Earlier, Pakistan lost opening bat Muneeba Ali early in their innings and were 16/1 in the sixth over, but Khan and Maroof got together for a 60-run second-wicket partnership to lay a strong foundation.
After Khan was dismissed lbw by de Silva in the 12th over, with the total 76/2, Maroof was joined by Javeria Khan (13) and they added 40 runs in just 4.4 overs to take Pakistan past the 100-run mark.
Maroof hit seven fours in her innings and scored at an impressive strike rate of 146.34. Although she received little support from Dar (3) and Nain Abidi (7), Pakistan got to a decent score, which proved too many for Sri Lanka.
Pakistan and Sri Lanka have both now won two of their three games, but Sri Lanka are placed above Pakistan on the points table because of a superior net run rate.
Scores: Pakistan Women 136-4 in 20 overs (Nahida Khan 38, Bismah Maroof 60 n.o., Sugandika Kumari 2/18)
Sri Lanka Women 113-9 in 20 overs (Yasoda Mendis 25, Nipuni Hansika 24, Nida Dar 5/21)

SPEAKER ON BOND REPORT RUMPUS:
Bogus claims tarnishing country
Due to various malicious and false statements being made based on the Bond report, the reputation of not only the MPs and Parliament, but even the reputation of the whole country is in jeopardy, said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, issuing a special statement with regard to statements and reports based on the Bond report.
Initially, someone had concocted a false list and said there were 118 MPs names on it, but now it has increased to 166. Not stopping at that, now they have leveled allegations against some reputed civil society figures as well. Therefore, I urge everyone, including the media to stop those malicious and baseless allegations immediately.
I have requested the Presidents Secretary to provide me with all the relevant documentation pertaining to the Bond report immediately, and he would do so with the cooperation of the Attorney General and the IGP as soon as he returns to the island, said the Speaker in his statement.
He noted that all relevant divisions had notified him that there was no list of any MP who had obtained any money from PTL.
Moreover, the Police have also notified me that there is no truth in the news being published that 25 ministerial security personnel had been questioned.
It is with deep regret that I note the carnage that was created in the country due to a false report that a sterilisation pill was found in a bowl of curry served in Ampara. Hence, I point out that this current situation is also as unhealthy for the country. Since yesterday, a huge social agitation has been noticed, with a highly unnecessary request for MPs to issue affidavits and calls for them to go before the media and pledge that they had not accepted any money from PTL. No matter what allegations are levelled against us, we must be true to our conscience, Speaker Jayasuriya said. If such incidents such as those alleged are reported, the Speaker noted that the Police will definitely take necessary measures to address them. Hence, he urged all relevant parties to act with responsibility and diligence, including the media.

She added, the British Council library is a popular venue for events catering to a more intimate crowd. We have always been happy to accommodate; and we realized over time that these events were drawing in a very interesting and diverse group of people who come here to both enjoy a performance and to meet other likeminded people as well.
Gill also hopes to see ideas coming to life in this new space- thats exactly why were embracing our new tagline it all happens here! she says.
On Sunday, the library eased the general public into its fresh, new vibe with an open day especially curated to involve all ages. While culture buffs enjoyed the day with a programme of open-mic sessions and theatre workshops, the younger attendees were as entertained with movie screenings and storytelling sessions.
Moving away from the conventional concept of a traditional library and how it operates, the addition of an instrumental area and Library Coffee Corner further echoes the new direction the British Council library is steering towards  a perfect combination of a study centre and a cultural hub.
With libraries situated in Colombo, Kandy, and Jaffna, the British Council community of members in Sri Lanka alone is now over 25,000 strong  the largest library membership in the British Council global network. In addition to easy access to over 500,000 books, magazines, DVDs, and resources, a membership card also allows for guaranteed entry to special events and activities at the library and discounts at Sarasavi, VijithaYapa and Chapters bookshops.
In keeping with the times, the library has also expanded its digital shelves to now include an online repertoire of over 14,000 e-journals and 119,000 ebooks, ranging in subject areas from Business and Economics to Anthropology.
It all does happen here after all.

Cathay Pacific to fly using  alternative jet fuel
Cathay Pacific is underscoring its strong commitment to eco-efficiency by planning to use a blend of alternative jet fuel to fly its new fleet of Airbus A350-1000 aircraft home to Hong Kong.
The airline has 20 of these technologically-advanced aircraft on order for delivery over the next four years. Its first A350-1000 will depart Airbus headquarters in Toulouse on June 19. A further seven aircraft are due for delivery by the end of 2018.
Cathay Pacific Chief Executive Officer Rupert Hogg said, We have been at the forefront of many initiatives to reduce the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. Achieving carbon neutral growth from 2020 is an important target that we take seriously and using alternative fuels is one of the key strategies in helping us to do so. We will continue to support the development and usage of biofuel to reach mainstream commercial viability.
Cathay Pacific operated the longest biofuel delivery flight at the time when taking delivery of its first Airbus A350-900 aircraft in 2016. Twenty-two aircraft of this type have so far been delivered with a 10% blend of alternative jet fuel in their tanks. 
Compared to traditional jet fuel, biofuel can reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%.
Cathay Pacifics A350-1000 delivery flights using blended biofuel are supported by its partners,Airbus and Total.
Frederic Evchenne, Head of New Energies at Airbus, said: Through the use of the A350-1000 and low carbon fuels, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to support the aviation sector and our customers to reduce their carbon footprint.
In May 2018, Fulcrum broke ground on its first commercial-scale plant in Nevada. When the plant begins operations in 2020, it will produce over 10 million gallons of fuel per year. Cathay Pacific will be one of the first airlines to fly on fuel produced from this facility.

Remedy to traffic congestion
The news item captioned Moves to resolve traffic congestion appeared in the daily press recently prompts me to submit the following proposals for the immediate attention of Transport Minister.
Proposal 1: Immediate solution
To establish Parking Lots at 3 selected Entry Points from the directions of Negombo, Kandy and Galle. Request the driver only vehicles to park and travel by bus to their workplace. It goes without saying that a satisfactory bus service should be arranged. Senior officials who need vehicles for their daily duties can burrow a vehicle from the office'. Those who do not like it can buy their comfort paying a daily fee of about Rs.200.
Yes, this system was in operation some time back on Galle Road but the failure is due to sheer lack of genuine interest on the part of relevant authorities.
Proposal 2: Long-term solution
All-time traffic congestion in and around Colombo, which is avoidable, is having disastrous, devastating and destructive repercussions on the national economy by way of overuse and wastage of fuel, which is heavily subsidized out of government coffers, making the Petroleum Corporation a Money Eating Monster on top of CEB, by vehicles idling at traffic jams, in addition to overwhelming loss of valuable man-hours. Traffic Jam is never as tasty as other Jams!
Did I say avoidable Yes, it's a simple idea but an uphill task on the other hand and nevertheless with recurring excellent benefits which will last until eternity for the good of generation after generation.
This means breaking up of all institutions - both government and private- employing hundreds and thousands of workers in Colombo area into four parts and relocation of each one-fourth part in Warakapola, Negombo and Kalutara on the three main entry routes, developing them as Parallel Cities on par with Colombo, except foreign-based high rise buildings.
Suitably softening the Megapolis Concept - the brainchild of our enterprising Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka is imperative and also worthwhile when compared with the ultimate outweighing benefits in the long run.
Once Parallel Cities are created, job-opportunities, residency, schooling, government services, financial services including banking, health services, transportation and all workplaces too will spread out evenly instead of nourishing only Colombo as the One and Only Heaven on Earth for the whole of Sri Lanka.
These Parallel Cities will eventually acquire land value and prestige on par with Colombo. Let all the citizens in every part of the country share the prosperity and all the good things equally.
Let the young families start building their new house, infant child's schooling, new job etc. rooting themselves in the new city. Relocation problems will naturally ease out with the passage of time. Timely patience and initial painful sacrifice will be a worthwhile investment for future prosperity. Rome was not built in a day!
Main modes of transport will become economical as buses and trains coming to Colombo can go back with a load of passengers. The number of people and vehicles entering Colombo too will be minimized, making a saving on fuel. This will also result in reducing the volume of garbage to be cleared from eating houses in Colombo, wittingly reminding of the Meetotamulla drama.
Over to you Mayoress of Colombo, Ministers of Transport and Megapolis.

Decision on influenza vaccine after expert studies
Without conducting precise studies on the effectiveness of the injection by experts in the field, the Health Ministry cannot recommend the influenza vaccine to be administered as protection against the flu, Health Services Director General Anil Jasinghe told the media.
He said so addressing the media following an inspection tour of the Galle Karapitiya Teaching Hospital on Wednesday.
We have a committee of experts to look into the matter pertaining to the control and prevention of epidemics. We are not quite certain of the effectiveness of the vaccine. We do not know exactly how well the influenza (flu) vaccine protects against flu. Sometimes the vaccine maybe effective or on the other hand, it may be nominal, he said.
The specialist consultative committee on communicable diseases will take a policy decision over the inclusion of the influenza vaccine into our national immunization programme. We do not need foreign consultations over the matter. We have erudite doctors with expert knowledge on the subject. We will take action as per the instructions of experts. However, the vaccines used under the National Immunization Programme are modified annually. The circulating viruses also change seasonally. This is a complex situation and we cannot arrive at swift decisions. Hence, we need some time to take firm resolution over the problem, the Director General stated.
Dr. Anil Jasinghe said, We cannot stop the private medical sections from administering the vaccine. It is a nationally registered injection. As such, we cannot restrict its use.
We have already initiated steps to provide equipment for the expansion of the capacity of the existing Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of the hospital. A Cabinet paper had been submitted for the purchase of required clinical gears for the ICU of Karapitiya Teaching Hospital without following general tender procedures, following the intervention by President Maithripala Sirisena and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
The ministry will provide additional medical staff, including nurses, he said.
Commenting on the current situation of the epidemic, Dr. Jassinghe assured that there is a substantial decline in the number of patient admissions to hospitals. The same epidemic situation prevailed in the previous years too and the flu is seasonal, he said. We initiate a number of measures to regulate the spread of seasonal influenza, he said.
Paediatric Consultant Prof. Sujeewa Amarasinghe also spoke.

Eat dark chocolate to keep doctor away!
Rich in nutrients
Chocolate with a high content of cocoa is loaded with nutrients, including a soluble fiber while also rich in iron, magnesium, copper, manganese, and potassium. Dark chocolate also contains a slight amount of mono- and polyunsaturated fats  good fats  which are shown to reduce cholesterol levels and decrease the risk of heart disease.
Improve blood flow
Antioxidants in dark chocolate stimulate the lining of the arteries creating a gas, which sends a signal to the arteries causing them to relax, enabling blood to flow easier. Having the blood flowing smoothly, it gets to all the body parts delivering the nutrients and oxygen with no complications.
Lowers blood pressure
Those same antioxidants that helps improve the blood flow are the ones that also decrease its resistance, and consequently eases the blood pressure in small amounts against the arteries. Even though it releases the pressure just a little bit, in time that is a big benefit for your heart. High blood pressure is always linked to heart diseases. So lowering it little by little is a huge help to eliminate risks.
Cuts down risks for heart disease
Eating dark chocolate a few times a week should cause much less cholesterol to lodge in the arteries and we should see a lower risk of heart disease over the long term. There are studies that revealed that eating chocolate 2 or more times per week greatly lowered the risk of having calcified plaque in the arteries. Eating chocolate less frequently had no effect. So regular consumption of dark chocolate can in fact reduce the risk of heart disease.
Raises good cholesterol and lowersbad cholesterol
The compounds in dark chocolate appear to be highly protective against the oxidation of LDL cholesterol, the bad cholesterol. It lowers the chances of LDL to get oxidized. When LDL oxidizes, it has reacted to free radicals, which makes the particle reactive and capable to damage other tissues.
Promotes weight loss
Researchers from the University of Copenhagen found that dark chocolate is far more filling, offering more of a feeling of satiety than its lighter-colored sibling. That is, dark chocolate lessens cravings for sweet, salty, and fatty foods. So if indulging in a bit of healthy dark chocolate should not only make it easy for you to stick to the small portion recommended for optimal health, but it should make it easier for you to stick to your diet in general.

The work to rule campaign by the Ceylon Electricity Engineers would commence from next Tuesday if the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) failed to approve the mixed power generation plan as a solution for the increasing demand for power, said the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union, yesterday.
The Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union President Saumya Kumarawadu said since the PUCSL failed to approve the plan and acted in violation of the law by proposing a plan which would incur a loss of Rs. 45 billion each year, the engineers decided to stage the trade union action.
He made this observation yesterday, at a press conference held at the Presidents Room of the Institute of Engineers Sri Lanka.
He added that with the initiation of the work to rule campaign, they would have to stop the function of power plants that do not have a proper licence, which included the Norochcholai power plant which is responsible for the generation of 30 percent of the required power for the country.
Although all qualifications have been fulfilled by the Norochcholai power plant, the licence has not been granted by the Central Environment Authority due to a case filed by an NGO, Kumarawadu said.
However, we are running this plant with all faith to provide a service to the country. But the PUCSL can take legal action against us if we run it while the work to rule campaign is implemented.
The CEBEU President said the Ace Thermal Power Plant in Ambilipitiya, Ace Thermal Power Plant in Matara and Barge Mounted Power Plant in Colombo Port too do not have licences.
He also warned that if power plants are deactivated outside of office hours, no engineer would attend to them.
Kumarawadu added that their demand is to approve the implementation of the long-term low-cost power generation project designed by the CEB in its mixed power generation plan.
He said the PUCSL did not approve the plan stating that they did so under the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena. However, the latter said at a meeting between the CEBEU, Presidents Secretary and PUCSL Director General that the President had not given such an instruction. So far, the issues had not been solved, Kumarawadu said. Hence, we have decided to take trade union action and apologize to the public for the inconvenience they would have to face.

Englands oldest rugby international Walker dies
LONDON, Thursday: Harry Walker England's oldest ex-international rugby union player has died aged 103 his former club Coventry announced.
Walker, a prop, made nine Test appearances for England -- making his debut at the advanced age of 32 in 1947 and had to buy his own pair of white shorts to play for his country as Coventry wore an all blue strip.
"When we started singing 'God Save The King', it got to me a bit," he told the BBC in 2015 on making his debut when George VI was King.
However, the meanness of the Rugby Football Union eventually got to Walker -- he and fellow team-mate Mickey Steele-Bodger were reprimanded for taking a taxi instead of a bus when they were at risk of missing eve of match training -- and he declined the opportunity to win another cap.
"We had to buy our own shorts," he told The Daily Telegraph in 2015.
"We all had jobs, so it cost money to play.
"All the while they (the RFU) filled the stadium."
Coventry organised a party for his birthday earlier this year leading him to remark 'Coventry has always been me'.
"It is with great sadness that we can confirm club patron and @EnglandRugby's oldest international Harry Walker has passed away aged 103," the club tweeted. Bill Beaumont, chairman of World Rugby, also paid a handsome tribute to Walker.
"Saddened to hear of Harry Walker's passing. At 103 years young, he was England's oldest international," tweeted the former England lock and captain.
"Stalwart of his beloved Coventry and a great character. Always enjoyed discussing all matters rugby with him when Fylde played Coventry. He will be greatly missed."
Coventry club president Peter Rossborough said Walker -- who was a loyal spectator and attended matches right up till April -- didn't care much for the backs.
"He was very single-minded that the only thing that mattered on a rugby field was how the forwards played and 'bxxxxr' the backs.
"Although he used stronger words," he told The Daily Telegraph.
Walker's loyalty to Coventry was such that despite earning a pittance as a tool fitter he turned down an offer to switch codes to rugby league side Huddersfield, who offered him a 100 signing on fee.
Walker -- who was once dropped by Coventry for scoring too many tries as it was not seen befitting for a prop to do such things -- played in all the Five Nations matches in both the 1947 and 1948 tournaments.  AFP

FB staff to learn Sinhala insults after Kandy riots
COLOMBO: Three months after Sri Lanka was rocked by anti-Muslim riots fuelled by online vitriol, Facebook is training its staff to identify inflammatory content in local languages.
The social network has been seeking penance in Sri Lanka after authorities blocked Facebook in March as incendiary posts by hardliners fanned violence that left three people dead.
Until the week-long ban, appeals to Facebook to act against the contagion of hate speech had been met with deafening silence, at a time when the California-based tech giant was reeling from unprecedented global scrutiny over fake news and user privacy.
We did make mistakes and we were slow, Facebook spokeswoman Amrit Ahuja told AFP in Colombo.
The dearth of staff fluent in Sinhala compounded the issue, with government officials and activists saying the oversight allowed extremist content to flourish undetected on the platform.
Ahuja said Facebook was committed to hiring more Sinhala speakers but declined to say how many were currently employed in Sri Lanka.
This is the problem we are trying to address with Facebook. They need more Sinhala resources, Telecommunication Minister Harin Fernando said.
Since the violence broke out in March, two high-level delegations from the company have visited Sri Lanka.
Ahuja said Facebook was working with civil society organisations to familiarise its staff with Sinhala slurs and racist epithets. AFP

Fracas at Maharagama UC as six Pohottuwa members sworn-in
A tense situation prevailed at the monthly meeting of the Maharagama Urban Council yesterday as opposition members of the council protested at the swearing in of six SLPP (Pohottuwa) members to the Urban Council (UC).
The Maharagama UC has been a controversial one at the last Local Government elections, starting with the rejection of the SLPP nomination list to the council. The party however ran through a proxy, independent group under the bicycle symbol. They won 25 seats at the council.
Seventeen of their members were from Divulapitiya/Badalgama and six from Wellawatte, only two were from Maharagama, said Maharagama UNP member Danushka Ramanayake.
Yesterday, one member from the SLFP, 11 from the UNP, five from JVP, one from Independent group 1 and five from the Badalgama group of the bicycle party got together to protest the six appointments. Maharagama UC, Chairman Tiraj Lakruwan having waited for the members to assemble had to postpone proceedings to June 20, due to a lack of quorum.
Chairman of the Elections Commission, Mahinda Deshapriya however said that they had the power to appoint six new female members from outside if there were no women on the list.
The six female members of the SLPP are, Savithri Gunasekara, Inoka Anuradha Ranaweera, Chithrani Sugathapala, Dineththi Heyara Jayasekara, Rewathi Mangalika Sigera and former Maharagama UC member, Kanthi Kodikara.
Kodikara speaking to Daily News said the UNP was simply incensed that their plans to get rid of the bicycle party and the SLPP were being thwarted. She said that when the Council meets next, more members of the SLPP would replace those of the bicycle party.

Gardening tips for beginners
The rewards of gardening are great  fresh air, exercise, beauty and relaxation, to name a few. But designing and planting your very first garden can feel like an overwhelming task. Luckily, gardens are surprisingly forgiving creations, and the best way to learn is by simply diving in. Here are 10 tips to help get a new garden off on the right foot.
Get to know your site
Take your time to get familiar with your property before beginning a new garden.
Determine your style and goals
Gather a few images that inspire you and look for a theme. Are you drawn to lush flower-filled gardens or more crisply defined modern outdoor spaces It helps to pair a few words with the pictures youve chosen, so try to come up with something that evokes the sort of garden you want, even if its not an official style term.
Start small
Dreaming is wonderful, but when it comes time to begin digging in the earth, its equally important to stay grounded in reality. The bigger the garden, the more time and energy it will require to maintain.
Make a plan
Even if youre planting only a single raised vegetable bed or cluster of potted flowers on the patio, having a plan is key. If youre not sure which plants to buy, take a research trip to a local nursery (without buying anything!) and snap photos of plants youd like to consider adding to your garden. Look at the tags and note down when they bloom, as well as sun and water requirements.
Pick the right tools for the job (without going overboard)
Having the proper tools makes garden chores more pleasant. The basics include:
Gardening gloves. Choose a pair that feels comfortable and protects against thorns.
Combine seeds and starts for an affordable mix
Starting an entire garden from seed can save money, but it can also be incredibly frustrating. Purchasing only started plants is not only expensive, but it also may limit your choice of what to grow. The best option is usually a combination of the two: Pick up some started seedlings at your local nursery and start some of your own from seed.

The Prime Minister said, Hema Nalin, who worked up the ladder at Rupavahini to become a programme director, earned popularity as a veteran announcer. The programme Namayayi Paha he presented through Rupavahini will never be erased from the memory of listeners.
Hema Nalin who also worked at Swarnavahini for some time, later worked as an independent media personality and opened his own Heritage Media Academy to train television announcers of both sexes.
Later, he started the Heritage Television channel to take Sri Lankas pride to the international world and was its Director until his demise.
Hema Nalin who won awards for his programmes such as Namayayi Paha, Ananda Rathriya and Saki Sanda was fortunate enough to earn permanent honour and acclaim from his friends and clients, the Premier stated.
Conveying his deepest sympathies to Hema Nalin Karunaratnes bereaved family members, relatives and friends, the Prime Minister wished him the eternal bliss of Nibbana.

Holder, Dowrich rescue Windies in Sri Lanka opener
PORT SPAIN, Thursday: West Indies rode their luck through a challenging first day of the first Test against Sri Lanka to reach 246 for six at stumps at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad on Wednesday.
A 90-run sixth-wicket partnership between captain Jason Holder and wicketkeeper-batsman Shane Dowrich was critical in wresting the initiative from the tourists after they had chosen to bat first in conditions that did not appear particularly taxing.
However the Sri Lankan seamers put in a tremendous effort on a generally placid surface with Lahiru Kumara leading the way in claiming three for 57 off 18 overs, including the important wicket of Holder for 40 just when it seemed the all-rounder was about to accelerate against a tiring attack in a long final session marking the start of the visitors' first-ever three-match Test series in the Caribbean.
Yet Dinesh Chandimal's team had only themselves to blame for letting the home side off the hook after the tea interval.
Holder only added two runs after being badly missed by Roshen Silva at second slip off Kumara, however the more expensive lapse had occurred earlier when Dowrich, on 16, offered a straightforward chance to Angelo Mathews at slip off Dilruwan Perera's off-spin and the opportunity was missed.
Relieved to have been granted that reprieve by Sri Lanka's former captain, Dowrich played with exaggerated care thereafter and resumes on the second morning on 46 in partnership with Devendra Bishoo, who batted through the final 40 minutes of the day without getting off the mark.
Earlier, Devon Smith's return to international cricket after more than three years ended in disappointment at the start of the day. Opening the batting with Kraigg Brathwaite, the 36-year-old left-hander watched his partner depart in just the third over of the match, caught behind off experienced seamer Suranga Lakmal. Smith, who last represented the regional side against England in his native Grenada in 2015, would have been especially keen to make an impact.
But his ambitions were undone by sharp work from Chandimal whose throw to the wicketkeeper from midwicket found the opener just short of his ground after he was called through for a single by new batsman Kieran Powell.
Powell sought to impose himself in putting on 40 for the third wicket with Shai Hope and looked to be getting on top of the bowlers when Kumara struck his first blow, uprooting the upright left-hander's leg-stump via the inside-edge.
Hope failed to take full advantage of two moments of good fortune, falling to a leg-side wicketkeeper's catch off Kumara for 44. But it was namesake seamer Lahiru Gamage who was left ruing opportunities lost.
On 29 just after the lunch interval, Hope chased a wide delivery and edged a catch to Dickwella only to be reprieved by a no-ball call. Hope and Roston Chase extended their fourth-wicket partnership to 54 when Kumara's persistence finally paid off. As expected, Rangana Herath played a bigger role at the bowling crease in the day's second session and the most successful left-arm spinner in Test history responded with the wicket of Chase for 38 via a sharp catch by Mathews at slip when the batsman edged an attempted cut.
With the innings listing at 147 for five at that stage, the advantage was certainly with the Sri Lankans before the resistance of Dowrich and Holder, combined with the tourists' sloppy outcricket, redressed the balance. AFP

Indian economy posts 7.7% growth, fastest pace in nearly two years
The Indian economy grew 7.7 per cent year on year in the January-March quarter, its quickest pace in nearly two years, driven by higher growth in manufacturing, the farm sector and construction.
The figure surpassed Chinas growth rate of 6.8 per cent in the January-March quarter, confirming India as the fastest growing major economy.
For the fiscal year that ended March 31, the Ministry of Statistics reported growth of 6.7 per cent, down from 7.1 per cent a year earlier. However, economists expect growth to be robust in the current financial year.
Investment activity has picked up, Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg told reporters, adding that the government expected a further acceleration in the coming year.
India also reported 4.7 per cent growth in annual infrastructure output in April, signalling a recovery after it slipped to a three-year low of 4.2 per cent in 2017/18.
Construction activity jumped to 11.5 per cent during the January-March quarter, after a 3.9 per cent drop in the year-ago period. Analysts said this reflected the fading impact of the governments move to scrap high-value bank notes that disrupted supply chains and caused job losses.
The data may offer a boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is set to seek a second term next year. His government launched a nationwide goods and services tax (GST) but its introduction was botched, nearly scuttling Indias growth prospects in the near term.
It seems like we have moved beyond the teething troubles related to GST implementation, said senior economist Tushar Arora at HDFC Bank. The pick-up in investment activity is also a good sign. The faster pace of growth in the latest quarter might strengthen expectations of an interest rate increase by the Indian central bank when it reviews monetary policy next week. Strait Times

Interfaith dialogue
The adherents of religions presume the truthfulness and the validity of the content of what is believed and taught in the name of their religion. Living and activating oneself according to the norms of ones religion follows. Meanwhile, the reliability and solidity of the basis for accepting the validity of any religion could also be investigated. Such inquiry could be on any aspect of its teaching, examining how compatible are they to truth and reality, how justified are its claims, how convincing are the elements that persuade, and how cogent, attractive, and appealing are the ways of relating to its content and even on the life of its founder. And shouldnt religions themselves be cleansed of error, inaccuracy, contradiction and falsity in practice handed down by the authoritative but imperfect subsequent teachers and adherents
SOURCE OF SPIRITUAL VIGOUR
The affirmed word of religion, clear normative code guide the lives of the adherents of a religion. The word of religion guides the thinking, the process of observing, understanding life and external reality. Judgments, decisions, and actions proceed. They bring positive and beneficial or negative and harmful consequences to followers and others.
The word of religion is intended to be liberating, uplifting and enhancing the life, spirit and mind of human beings. Religion brings to life a bright ray of hope. Religion does not depreciate, demean or threaten human life. Religion should help everyone to preserve life and persevere in life, reassuring everyone. Lived religion gives all the resilience that even in the process of trial and error and many a failure positive attitudes prevail, hope is not lost and life is not forfeited.
Religions emphasize the importance of enlightenment, relating to and concern for others. Admitting ones faults, repenting for them and amendment of life bring freshness and give new inner strength to their followers. Worthwhile religion is associated with kindness, benevolence, gentleness, meekness and humility. They give strength and meaning to life. They enable anyone to give up a blemished past and graciously begin life afresh, step into the future morally cleansed and with new spiritual vigour.
BIAS BLEMISHES RELIGION
The messages or the word of religions has come down to us from human sources of past ages. Naturally, the reliability of the source underpins the content of what is communicated. The truthfulness, the inner coherence of the message and its sagacity, reasonableness and its purpose become clear and persuasive especially in the way it guides people to seek the truth, to reach the transcendent and to relate to one another.
Yet all followers of any religion are not always consistent; their values, beliefs and actions may not always cohere and concord with the religion they profess. Even universally persuasive and objectively true and sound doctrine, when filtered through preconceptions, prejudice, partiality and bias handed down from generation to generation could misdirect reasoning, judgement, attitudes, doctrines and decisive action. Then, when other elements incompatible with coherent development weigh in, teaching and actions even of authoritative figures become inconsonant and inconsistent with the pristine teaching. Political powers and political influence have sometimes arbitrarily and selfishly arrogated to themselves authority, distorted religion and even misled nations. When authority is thus annexed, bias and actions of authorities distort religions teachings to suit the desires of political powers. Followers get misdirected. Misunderstanding and ignorance of others often lead to suspicion and misjudgement. Consequently, social confusion and antagonism follow over generations where such would not have otherwise arisen. Had the teachings of religion been faithfully adhered to, disturbances on account of belief would not have been created, peace and order could have subsisted.
It is therefore up to the teaching authorities to adhere to the true and authentic teaching of the religious Founder and the tradition faithful to him and aid each adherent to appropriate religion anew.
It is important to note that the meaning of the original words of the Founder could also be misunderstood and misinterpreted due to the ignorance of the idiom of the original language or not having a reliable translation and therefore ignorance of the real meaning. When the key and basic word or the key phrases are central to the main doctrines, their correct understanding is very important to illumine and inspire correct stand-points, pure stances, right attitudes and decisive action and response or reaction in life situations.
UNFAITHFUL TO FOUNDER
It also so happens that though the instructions of the Founder are correctly understood, the weight of actual tradition and practice is such that individuals and communities could nevertheless persist on the wrong path. This is seen among Buddhists, Hindus, Christians and Muslims. They could not be faithful adherents of their respective Founders and true to their scriptures and be racially prejudiced and caste minded and engage in fratricide; Some Muslims such as the Taliban, Al Qaeda could not be professing a merciful God and shed the blood of innocent people branding them infidels. For whatever reason honour killing is against basic human norms. All of us of whatever religion should take care not to turn fanatical in belief and act rashly and commit a crime against our fellowmen.
As a result of the distorted and misinterpreted understanding of the religious teachings, we turn ourselves into inhuman beings denying others even the space to live.
Everyone needs to study and reflect well to come to a proper understanding of religious teachings and the Founder one chooses to follow. And consequently, all need to accept and adhere to the way of life and discipline the teachings call for. Today most people emphasize on the establishment and strengthening of relationships that bring about good understanding and reconciliation among different communities of religious adherents.
RELIGIONS AND SPIRITUAL GROWTH
Teachings on moral life and relationships, common to all, if followed seriously, do not cause stagnation in lives without meaning and purpose or satisfactory direction and healthy associations with fellow human beings. Religion should lead also to compassionate openness to the spiritual search of others, to better human kindred and to spiritual growth. If the enlightenment from religions truly convert and refresh people, evils of iniquity, immorality, selfishness, theft, rape, homicide, hypocrisy, dishonesty, corruption and indifference would not be so widespread among them. When religion does not revitalize people it remains superficially external, not interiorized. Such religion is exploited by greedy politicians for their selfish purposes of creating a rivalry, envy, suspicion leading to conflict and bloodshed.
We in Sri Lanka are still to gain vibrancy and vitality in our mutual spiritual growth through sincere sharing of thought and interreligious dialogue. We have not consistently launched into investigations on doctrines of even the main religions in Sri Lanka or deepened our self-understanding and understanding the bases and fundamentals of other religions. The fundamental principles we hold dear should lead all adherents to honour and respect others as fellow human beings and willingly accord to all justice, equality and freedom in keeping with human dignity and human rights. Where there is no respect for human dignity, truth and honesty, justice and fairness, real religion is dead, phoney religion prevails and society degenerates.
We need to investigate and better understand the fundamental truths the Founders of religions underlined. We need to ask whether they (!) or we failed - where, why and how - to underline the intrinsic dignity and worth of every human being. Today, we should understand the intrinsic worth of the least of our brethren, whatever their religion may be, and compassionately care for them, not humiliate them on any account, if we wish to be called civilized.
RELIGIONS NOT POLITICIANS TOOLS
An environment for mutual understanding is created on important social and religious occasions. Further, religious leaders coming together create among the people a truly fraternal atmosphere leading to spiritual enrichment. They should strive to banish from the community mistrust and suspicion and enhance humanness, amity and spiritual growth among all our people.
This should not become some kind of strategy merely to bring together important personalities of the major religions in Sri Lanka occasionally as a much needed social project today lending itself also to political machinations. The biggest rogues in politics also often visit places of worship. Religious authorities should detect their enticements given with political advantages in view.
Meetings of all religious leaders should be undertaken seriously because it behoves to raise the interior quality of peoples lives. Peoples lives need to be protected from many social, moral and political evils. Thereby religions together would make a major contribution to improve society and build the nation. To create a new Sri Lanka in which genuine national solidarity, reconciliation, unity and peace prevail, we should critically look at ourselves and not overlook that religions and their followers need cleansing.

Key Supply Chain  Management  Metrics  that you ever need
Tomake rapid decisions in todays fast-acting environment, we need smart, time-saving, easy to interpret and most importantly decision-supporting key performance indicators. We have collected the most important supply chain metrics.
Kaizen, Lean and Six Sigma
When looking at business process improvement methodologies like Kaizen, Lean and Six Sigma, its very easy to see a lot of similarities. After all, these frameworks aim to make a business as competitive as possible, while striving for top-notch performance, efficiency, effectiveness and reliability. Additionally, all of the three methods employ cycles of gathering data, evaluating it, making practical and quantifiable optimization, and tracking the results. This means that even if you have a previous familiarity with each methodology, its easy to spot a lot of similarities and apparent overlaps, especially as one gets buried under an avalanche of buzzwords. On top of this, many of the professionals implementing each methodology might also draw additional inspiration for refinements from other frameworks, which blurs the lines another step further.
While many methods might sound analogous in theory, Kaizen, Lean and Six Sigma have some significant differences that stem from their core values and assumptions about business and improvement in general. To put this in practical terms, the most influential differences between these three methodologies lie in the exact type of metrics each one values the most, and devotes effort to improving. It should come as no surprise that even the slightest changes to the particular metric that importance is placed upon would certainly lead to decisively divergent outcomes and results.
Because of these facts, comparing Kaizen, Lean and Six Sigma can be of great value to a business and its management team, and is an integral part of selecting the best methodology to implement in any given situation.
What is Kaizen
The first of the three approaches to examine is Kaizen. Its name comes from Japanese, and loosely translates to change for the better. Broadly speaking, its not just a management and business process optimization methodology, but a general philosophy that could be applied to both ones personal life and a business organization.
The two core beliefs that inform how Kaizen operates are:
1. Everything can be improved
2. Small gradual changes can lead to significant overall and long term improvements
This means that Kaizen can be applied to absolutely anything, and it doesnt really have a specific type of metric that it favors. It doesnt usually produce rapid results. However, when applied over a long period of time, it creates a mentality whereproblems are fixed without a committee or leadership approval for every little change. This leads to more employee engagement and involvement in the process.
What is Lean
While Kaizen is a very general approach to improvement, Lean is a methodology with a background in manufacturing that focuses on a very specific type of metrics. Its a framework that is already older than a century, and it was a pivotal part for Henry Fords Model Ts success. Obviously, the Lean methodology has evolved over the years, but its main focus has remained the same  eliminating waste in order to free uptime to increase value to your customer. The main target of this approach is efficiency across the system (value stream). It has proven quite successful in improving or removing all the inefficient steps of a process that waste time, energy, finance or raw materials. Lean provides a competitive edge since it allows a business to manufacture products or provide services faster and at lower costs. It also is easy to learn, which makes it easy for all employees to be involved in improvements.
What is Six Sigma
While Kaizen and Lean both look at resources and ways to optimize a process, the core goal of Six Sigma is achieving consistent and reliable results. It is primarily focused on improving the quality of the result or outcome of the process. This is why its sometimes referred to as a quality assurance methodology, despite the fact that it has been successfully applied beyond just quality improvements.
As far as results go, Six Sigma strives for near perfection, where the process succeeds 99.99966% of the time. To achieve this seemingly impossible result, training and coaching is required in order to learn the tools and framework, modeled after the martial arts belt system. These results lead to lower costs, improved customer satisfaction, and helps drive continuous improvement in order toachieve higher and higher sigma levels.
In an organization undertaking a lean transformation and striving for operational excellence and continuous improvement, leaderships role is even more critical, since many lean-leader attributes are not taught in business schools, nor are they intuitive. When rolling out an improvement effort, executives are initially excited by the early returns from low-hanging fruit, but many quickly become disenchanted when the pace of improvement weakens or pauses.
Zero loss thinking
Zero loss thinking identifies where to focus your improvement activities. Zero-based thinking is a performance management mind-set in which there is no acceptable level of failure: no off quality, no breakdowns, no delays, no customer complaints, no manufacturing wastes, etc. Through this systematic approach of uncovering root causes of less-than-optimized work streams.
Milliken performance system
Like other business management strategies, such as Six Sigma and lean manufacturing, the Milliken Performance System helps businesses increase productivity, quality, and efficiency. But the Milliken Performance Systems distinction is that it changes the entire business culture by engaging everyone, resulting in long-term, holistic, sustainable improvement.The Milliken Performance System promotes the goal of reducing defects, breakdowns, waste and other abnormalities to almost zero as the expected norm. The system is characterized by a foundation of safety and strategic clarity and is supported by 9 pillars which continue to drive Milliken to be a lean enterprise. By implementing the Milliken Performance System, you can dramatically improve your operational performance and employee engagement.
System is built to focus on:
* Properly managing equipment
* Improving associates skills and knowledge
* Preventive and predictive maintenance
Six steps of transformation:
* Accommodate, educate, and demonstrate
* Assessment
* Master plan
* Plant implementation plan
* Model within plant
* Replication
Lean Six Sigma in future manufacturing
To hypothesize about the future importance of Lean Six Sigma, we first need to make clear if it has been successful in the past. It has! Numerous high-quality empirical papersincluding several of the panel participantsestablish that both Lean and Six Sigma have measurable positive benefits on performance. Lean is a powerful system. So why not use it. It claims that if you have a process, and you have a customer for that process, then Lean applies. Thus, only when something is produced for the sake ofart, Lean has limited or no application.
Second, we need to evaluate whether the manufacturing paradigm will be the same as the one we have today or change radically. It describe, how the Lean Six Sigma we have today, is the result of hundred years of development: Lean comes from the Toyota Production System (TPS), which is based a lot on Fords mass production system, which again builds on Frederick Taylor, and so on and so on. Now we have been in the same manufacturing paradigm for a century. So, what will happen when we move to the next manufacturing paradigmwhen we seriouslystart toapply the internet of things, 3D printing, automation, and nano-technologies in manufacturing
The panel agrees that: Lean Six Sigma might take new forms, but it will not be abandoned. Aparticipant in the audience points out that Lean was defined in the 20thcentury; probably it has to be somewhat redefined for the 21stcentury. It suggest that the value created should be redefined from the financial measures we use today tosustainabilityat large. Thats a good suggestion!
Lean Six Sigmaworthy of future research
Despite the enormous amount of research that has gone into studying improvement programs like Lean and Six Sigma, there is no sign of a declining interest. We know that implementation of Lean Six Sigma is troublesome for many companies, so there is still a need for a better understanding of when and where it applies. Lean Six Sigma is clearly worthy of more research, and the panel suggests a few routes it could take:
The Six Sigma Renaissance
Process standardization and quality improvement had been neglected in the financial service industry for decades. When the manufacturing industry needed to become more efficient and reduce waste, the financial service industry was flourishing and therefore, found itself not in need for major improvement initiatives. When this situation changed, everyone suddenly started to look for a quick fix and Six Sigma, which had already been so successful in the manufacturing industry a method of Quality control, was seen by many as the golden path.
Countless financial services companies have followed this path and have implemented Six Sigma in the last decade. Some have been very successful and happily announce their multi-million dollar savings. However, many others keep very quiet about their returns or have stopped their engagement in Six Sigma all together because they didnt attain the expected return on their investment. This is reflected in the coverage of Six Sigma in the financial service sector  there is only a handful of books available on the topic, while there are hundreds on the use of Six Sigma in manufacturing.
Why Six Sigma has been so successful in the manufacturing industry, but only worked for a small group of finance firms More importantly, how can the financial service sector make better use of Six Sigma Without question, Six Sigma is a well-accepted quality enhancement method which has been applied with great success in the manufacturing industry for decades. However, Six Sigma methods cannot just be transferred from the manufacturing industry to the financial service industry without any changes. Let us review the main strengths and pitfalls of Six Sigma, when transferring it to the financial service industry strengths.
Unique customer focus
Focus on the customer is one of the main strengths of Six Sigma. By linking quality improvement initiatives to customer needs, Six Sigma teams ensure that the improvement has a positive impact on the customer. Particularly in the financial service industry, where the interaction with the customer takes place on a daily basis, customer focus is of utmost importance. When implementing Six Sigma in finance processes, customer needs have to be given highest priority. Short-sighted focus on cost or headcount reduction will not bring the long term benefits Six Sigma promises. Only a close cooperation with customers and a clear focus on customer needs can lead Six Sigma to success in a financial service environment.
2. Six Sigma framework and tool kit
Many financial service organizations have not engaged in structured process improvement until recently. Therefore, they often lack standardized processes, organized quality and engineering departments and a general understanding of what quality improvement means to them. Six Sigma provides, with the grater cycle, a structured framework to guide users throughout the improvement efforts and ensures that the project develops in the desired direction. Additionally, Six Sigma comes with a whole tool kit of brainstorming, analysis and prioritization tools that help to unfold its power. This structured approach, combined with the Six Sigma tools are particularly valuable for teams with a financial service background.
3. Data-driven and statistical methodology
Some may argue that financial service process improvement greatly benefits from its data richness. However, in my experience exactly this data overflow is one of the main problems for successful project selection and completion in this industry. Too many improvement efforts are based on ill selected data and the general assumption that the problem root cause is already known before the project even starts. This causes projects to fail and the improvement efforts to lose their reputation. Six Sigma offers a more statistical approach to measuring and analyzing data, thereby minimizing the risk of quick assumptions and allowing projects to be wisely selected and executed.
Weaknesses:
1. Resistance from people
I experienced that resistance towards change is even greater in the service industry, than in manufacturing. The average white-collar worker seems to be extremely unaware of the waste in his daily work and is, to my surprise, very resistant towards others outlining this waste to him. Now this most likely originates from the fact that processes in the service industry are invisible, following an unwritten process through electronic data exchange and peoples heads. Seeing and accepting waste in such a virtual environment is more difficult than in a factory, where bottlenecks and process defaults are physically existing. This resistance leads to many project failures and makes it very difficult to implement Six Sigma.
2. High initial investment and slow return on investment
The financial service industry is famous for its fast-paced culture, striving from one budget to another. However, for anyone looking for short term return on investment, Six Sigma is not the right cure. Six Sigma requires a high level of initial investment for implementation and the first years of Six Sigma introduction into an organization are particularly costly. During this period Six Sigma experts and employees have to be trained or recruited and senior management focus on Six Sigma implementation is required. Additionally, return on investment is often not realized in the short term.
From an organization-wide perspective, achieving a break-even from implementing Six Sigma takes a considerable amount of time as initial investment is high and results from improvements might only become apparent after several months.
Recommendations and Outlook for Six Sigma in Financial Services
Six Sigma is more a culture than it is a methodology. In order to make it work, you have to prepare your whole organization to embrace the values and ideas behind the concept. If you are looking for a quick fix to make the next budget, then Six Sigma is definitely not the right thing for you. The same holds for organizations that have not yet had any or only limited engagement with quality and process improvement. If you still have a lot of low hanging fruits out there, then go for Lean and 5S first.
However, if you are willing to take your organization through a true transformation, to standardize and re-engineer processes and to make a long-term commitment to Six Sigma, then go for it.
Success cases from the financial service industry and many years of successful implementation in the manufacturing industry prove that Six Sigma is indeed a very effective method to bring your organization to the next level.
Both of the weaknesses outlined in this article can, with the right commitment, be reduced to a minimal. Once you have made the initial investment of time, effort and money, Six Sigma will reward you with a very worthy return on your investment.
In my opinion, particularly the ever increasing importance of outsourced finance services brings a never before seen centralization and standardization to financial organizations.
This allows for large scale projects and makes the return on investment more favorable, than implementing Six Sigma in small decentralized offices. The most recent developments in the financial and supply chain industry and the harsh competition following the financial crisis have further strengthened the need for more cost efficient solutions and better quality.
At the same time, many players in the financial service industry have already hit their climax in getting process improvement from Lean. Thats why I predict that Six Sigma will see a renaissance  this time not in manufacturing, but in Supply Chain.

From kill shelter to royal life
Guy the beagles unlikely journey started from a US kill shelter to a Canadian adoption group  and now hes part of the royal family. With Meghan Markle marrying Prince Harry, Guy has launched into another chapter of his rather charmed life.
Its a total fairytale, said Alison Preiss of Pet Valu, the Ontario pet store where the rescue dog was adopted by Markle in 2015.
Here is this dog that was in a shelter, nobody wanted him, and through this wonderful adoption hes now living in a palace, running around with the royal family.
Guys unlikely journey began after a shelter in the US sent an email to Dolores Doherty, who runs an Ontario-based organisation, A Dogs Dream Rescue, which saves beagles slated to be put down in the US and brings them to Canada to be adopted.
This time, a shelter in Kentucky was asking if she would be interested in a 17lb beagle that had been found in the woods. After he had spent days at the shelter, nobody had come forward to adopt him, and the dog was on the euthanasia list.
A network of volunteers helped transport the dog more than 500 miles to the Canadian border, each of them driving him for one hour before handing him over to the next waiting car.
He hadnt even been in Canada for a full day when Doherty brought him to an adoption event on the outskirts of Toronto. He was just sitting there with those big beagle sad eyes, looking so depressed. He was irresistible, said Doherty.
Dozens of people had turned up to meet the 20 or so dogs up for adoption, including Markle, who at the time was living in Toronto while her TV series Suits was being filmed.
Doherty  who had never heard of Suits  had no inkling of Markles celebrity status.
The first hint of Markles fame came after Doherty said she would have to carry out a home visit to confirm some of the details listed in her application, such as the fenced-in backyard. Markle said it wouldnt be a problem  but asked her to make an appointment for security reasons.
Doherty never made it to Markles house. Instead, she followed Guys new life on Instagram, delighting in snaps of the beagle as he strolled the streets of Toronto next to Markle or curled up beside her at home, napping.
After news broke of Markles engagement to Prince Harry, Doherty revelled in the idea that one of her dogs would now be joining the royal family. Its just beyond my wildest imagination, she said. How is that for rags to riches story from a good old Kentucky beagle
In November, Prince Harrys communication secretary confirmed that Guy had moved to the UK and was living with Markle. Her other dog, Bogart, is believed to be too old to make the journey across the Atlantic and is staying with Markles close friends.
While Guy now ranks as the most famous of her rescue dogs, hes far from the only one with a remarkable story, Doherty said.
Of the 1,600 or so dogs her organisation has rescued in the past seven years, some have gone on to become cancer detection dogs while a few support people who have depression or panic attacks. Others have found work as detection dogs along the Canada-US border.
The dogs that have come up here have really impacted a lot of lives, she said. So there are a lot of happy endings, but his certainly is the most outstanding.

Knuckles allegation: Kiriella hits out
Public Enterprise and Kandy Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday hit out at environmental groups for spreading false accusations against him and Minister Kabir Hashim with regard to land within the Knuckles Reserve being sold to the private sector. Addressing a media briefing together with officials of the ministry at the Department of Government Information, Kiriella stressed that only loss making state plantation lands owned by the Janatha Estate Development Board (JEDB), Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation (SLSPC) and Elkaduwa Plantations were being looked at in order to further develop them under public-private partnerships and long term leases to private companies. The Minister had invited the main proponent of these allegations, Environment Conservation Trust Director Sajeewa Chamikara to the press conference but the latter failed to turn up to respond to the minister. Another notable absentee was the official from the Department of Forest Conservation who was also invited.
No land within the Knuckles Reserve is sold or will be sold. These are plantation lands which have nothing to do with the Reserve, the Minister said.
He further explained that when in 1992, 540,000 acres of plantation land was privatized and given to various plantation companies, the lands the companies did not want were retained by the government- these were the worst of the lot.
Every year the Treasury has been allocating Rs.1,000-1,500 million to maintain these plantations and the Treasury had asked that we come up with a proposal to work with the private sector. It is then that we called for proposals for projects that can make use of these uncultivated sections of the plantations,Minister Kiriella said. Advisor on the Plantation Sector Upali Wijesekara said it would cost Rs.7 million per hectare over seven years to replant and revive these plantations. The government does not have the money for that. The Minister said they had received 695 proposals and they accepted 254 out of them. These proposals were submitted to Cabinet and the lease of plantation land to these projects in principle were given Cabinet approval.
These companies will now have to submit EIAs and get permission from the relevant government agencies before they proceed. Nothing has been built on the ground as of yet, he said.
Ministry Secretary Ravindra Hewavitharana further explained that investment into these plantations were dire as it affected the estate workers who depended on them.
We have 1693 cases of EPF/ETF/ gratuity (Rs 1800 million) not being paid to these workers for the last 20 years. We cant give many of them work because there is nothing much to pluck in these estates, he said.
At present, Rs.300 million in EPF/ETF/gratuity remains to be paid. At Hare Park estate, one of the most controversial and most unprofitable, is located at the boundary of Knuckles but its workers can only manage 2-3 days of work per month, What do we do with these workers if we cant pay them and the environmentalists dont let us develop the plantation,asked the minister. A USD 2 billion dairy project has been proposed at Hare Park, said the Minister and added that the unions and workers have welcomed the project.
Only milking cows will be here. The investor has said that the cows will eventually be exported when it is time to kill them. No cow will be killed here, he said.
SLSPC Chairman Thilak Mahanama added that no proposal to build hotels in these plantations near Knuckles have been approved. He explained that only projects that were suitable to the relevant environment were approved.

Firstly, the course duration was extended from 36 weeks to 50 weeks and secondly awarding the Master of Business Administration in Logistics Management from the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU).
For the first time, two Officers from two friendly foreign countries, the Republic of Maldives and the Kingdom of Nepal joined the course. The Logistics staff Course No  4 commenced with 32 officers on 9 March, 2017 with representatives of two friendly foreign countries, Bangladesh and Nepal.

MR, Cabraal responsible for micro company crises: Eran
Former Finance Minister, ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal should be held responsible for the crisis situation faced by many micro finance companies in the country, said State Minister Eran Wickremetane yesterday.
State Minister Wickremeratne pointed out that the ex-regime did nothing when there was a financial crisis in the Asian market from 2008-2009. They pretended as there was nothing serious going on, he said. Even when the professionals of the Central Bank pointed out the repercussions of such ignorance to the Monetary Board, no steps were taken, Wickremeratne further said.
State Minister Wickremeratne also pointed out that there were only 28 finance companies in the country in 2005, which increased from a 60% by 2014. As at 2014, the number of finance companies had grown into 48, he said.
This growth is a result of providing licenses to their relatives, friends and political allies. It was the same case when giving license to Leasing companies, Wickremeratne further said.
Joining the Adjournment Motion on the ETI Finance crisis, State Minister Wickremeratne said that the Central Bank had taken several steps to curtail further such crisis situations. These include appointing an enforcement and resolution unit and a concessionary of six hundred thousand via an insurance policy, he pointed out.
Speaking of several finance companies in similar crisis situations, Wickremeratne said that there was a delay in legal action being taken against Central Investment and Finance PLC (CIFL). He said the Attorney Generals Department was looking into the matter.
Speaking of the first Singapore based investor to the ETI Finance: Blue Summit Capital Management, the State Minister said that the Central Banks Financial Intelligence Unit had not received any negative report in the said investor.
Speaking of irregularities taking place in the Entrust Holding Company who allegedly have robbed the general public of Rs.10 billion, Wickremeratne pointed out that there were brothers of the MPs in the Joint Opposition in that companys Board of Directors.
He also raised concerns over the use of the word bank by these finance companies which are not under the purveiw of the Central Bank.

Natures wild life refuge
Juliet Coombe discovers the ethereal beauty of Anawilundawa International Wetlands, where even the tortoises are stars in this wetlands paradise of interconnecting tanks created by the ancient rulers of Sri Lanka.
Nowhere is more teaming with life than the ancient man made tanks of Sri Lanka and in the rainy season what starts off as a wildlife exploration quickly turns into an intrepid adventure. Mud spurted out in all directions as our vehicle wheels spun around and dug deeper into the mud while a curious monkey swung over to see what all the noise and commotion was about. Looking around this stunning 12th century hand-built tank with its ethereal landscapes that look just like monsters in the darkness, I was amazed, as the light started to flicker through the trees across the water, just how beautiful this protected wetland, jungle is; even stuck miles from anywhere in a lot of mud. Looking back on the adventure, I could not think of a better place to break down than in Anawilundawa International Ramsar Wetland, near Chilaw and a lifetime away from urban living.
A chorus of birds filled the air with their whimsical music, heralding the imminent tropical sun rise, and only the harsh mating calls of a couple of peacocks broke the orchestra of wonderful sounds. I learn how both indigenous and migratory birds have been using the ancient system of human-made cascading tanks for over a thousand years to catch fish, insects and even, in one case, a small frog. I am informed by my excellent Jetwing Ayurveda Pavilions guide, as I carry rocks to further bulk up the back of the wheels, that the tanks range between 12 and 50 hectares each, dating back to the 12th century, when the King of Sri Lanka wanted to make the island totally self sustaining.
As the dawn rose, monkeys started to appear in troops, playing and chattering away, as we piled up more stones and wood under the wheels to give the vehicle something to grip on, and, as the sky turned an array of colours, a star tortoise ambled across the road to go for a drink in the tank, stopping to look at us nonchalantly before popping his head back into his pretty shell. As hawks circled, I was glad we finally, at full throttle, managed to release ourselves from the bank and head further into the reserve on a sturdier pathway.
Birds flew over us in formation patterns and as I took pictures, I was quietly thrilled we were on the move again, as I thought, looking back at how far we were dug in, that, at one point, the stunning Star Tortoise had more chance of reaching Negombo than we did. The clever builders of these manmade water holes saw the redirection of the river into linked tanks, as the perfect way for paddy cultivation to develop across the country in the12th century. The Kings aim, it seems, was to make manmade lakes everywhere in the country, as he wanted to develop the paddy cultivation to such a level that they could trade it and eventually become the breadbasket of Asia. The incredible thing is that they still work to this day irrigating the area.
Ramsar is part of six conservation protection schemes in Sri Lanka and Anawilundawa is made up of 1,397 hectares of incredible wetlands between the coastline and Negombo. One theory about the area and its name is that it is a Tamil word as there was also a Tamil King involved in the development of agriculture. Ana, interestingly, means elephant in Tamil, and Wilma means marsh area, and legend has it that an elephant was trapped in the marsh. However, most of the villagers say this is nonsense and it is just because the trees and plants around the tanks look like marsh elephants, which, on closer inspection, I could see how some tree configurations did indeed look just like bachelor elephants stuck for all time.
Being in the middle of a conservation area, bird watching or, in some cases, meditating before dawn, to pick up the sacred vibrations of this ancient woodland, is a wonderful experience and to see night turn into day is an unforgettable one. This wetland, I am told, consists of six large manmade tanks and three smaller tanks interconnected to create a complex irrigation system. The larger tanks are: Pinkattiya, Maradansola, Anawilundawa, Mayyawa, Surawila and Vellawali. Today the natural waterways, which fed this system, are lost without a trace and these tanks are filled by flood waters of the Deduru Oya brought to the area via the Sengaloya scheme.
Local communities have practiced sustainable traditional farming for over eight hundred years and fishing since ancient times, but the extension of prawn, also known as shrimp, farms in surrounding areas has resulted in mangrove destruction and pollution. The pollution is also caused by the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in nearby coconut plantations, which, in turn, over oxygenate the water and poison some types of fish, and ultimately the whole food chain, which is why education on a nature has never been more important at village and city level.
Stopping from time to time to walk another section of Tank 2, I was amazed by the size of the monitor lizards which could easily be mistaken for crocodiles as they came sliding over the bank looking for food; with their long tongues snapping in an out, they were not in the least bit worried about my presence. For me, meditating here is something very special, as the wildlife seems to be totally at peace with those who visit. Normally, getting close to birds is impossible without a zoom lens, and yet, at Anawilundawa, the animals ignored our loan vehicle. Not being on the tourist list of must-see places makes this something very special and perfect for those people who want a more spiritual experience where they can meditate about life in a National Geographic setting.

New Zealand cricket coach Hesson quits
WELLINGTON, Thursday: New Zealand cricket coach Mike Hesson announced Thursday he was quitting, a year out from the World Cup, citing family reasons.
During his 6-year tenure, the 43-year-old -- described by former captain Brendon McCullum as the best coach the Blackcaps have ever had -- guided the team to new heights across all three formats.
Although he had a year left on his contract, Hesson said he no longer felt fully committed to the role and his resignation would take effect at the end of next month.
I know what's required over the next 12 months, but if I'm honest, I don't feel I have the capacity to give the job what it deserves, he said. Hesson said he had no job to go to and his motivation for standing down was based purely on a need to pause and refresh, and to spend more time with his family.
New Zealand Cricket chief executive David White said he had tried to persuade Hesson to stay on, but that he understood his reasons for walking away.
Mike has overseen one of NZC's most successful periods of international cricket, he's more than realised the potential we saw in him back in 2012, and has grown into one of the most respected coaches on the international circuit, he said.
New Zealand captain Kane Williamson said Hesson would be remembered as a selfless coach who extracted the maximum potential from his teams.
Under Hesson's reign, New Zealand played 53 Tests for 21 wins and 13 draws and won 65 of 119 one-day internationals and 30 of 59 T20s. During his tenure, New Zealand also made the final of the 2015 World Cup.
New Zealand are currently ranked fourth in Tests and ODIs and third in T20s. AFP

NIMAL LEWKE: a great sport who also fought for the liberation of the country
Nimal Lewke has many attributes as a outstanding sportsman and a coach but what sets him apart as a Legend is what he did in outwitting dreaded terrorists with his dare devilry, risking his own life as Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police and Commandant Special Task Force.The details to pen are mind boggling.
LEWKE was assigned the task of protecting President J.R. Jayewardene at a time when the LTTE and JVP were targeting him. He also provided protection for Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe. The LTTE were a much feared outfit and for his bravery and gallantry in helping to end terrorism he should have been named a national hero.
From boxer to ruggerite
From boxer to ruggerite, to referee to President of the Sri Lanka Rugby Federation, to coach, to referee to President of the Asian rugby football Union to cricketer. LEWKE had it all. And to cap it all he excelled in all these aspects which no other in the sports field here had attained.
But reminiscing, LEWKE was in the maul during the thick of the terrorist war that plagued the country for a near three decades as Senior Superintendent of Police finishing as Commandant of the Special Task Force. When the war ended while lesser mortals rejoiced and were rewarded, men who were in the thick of the war, putting their lives on the line like LEWKE were not rewarded or given due recognition.
It is said that the games the thing and to LEWKE a flanker of great talent in rugby, the greatest moment and achievement was the ending of the wretched war with him playing his part to perfection and letting his countrymen free to indulge in their daily life and also resume all sports activities that was at a standstill. But LEWKE is not one to blow his own trumpet.
Boxer of promise
As a sportsman initially he started his career at St Sylvesters College, Kandy as a boxer of promise and repute with great skill. The coach who taught him the tricks in the roped square, the hooks, the upper cuts the one-two, the knockout punches.
All that was taught and shown how by that incomparable boxing coach the great Derek Raymond who took boxing at the school to heights never attained before. The Stubbs Shield was the in thing in schools boxing and St. Sylvesters regularly carried away this trophy to Kandy.
LEWKE was a national boxing champion and boxed for the country in the Kings Cup Boxing championship, in Bangkok and TATA sports festival in India in 1972. As a schoolboy he won the Best Boxer trophy at the Intermediate Championships in 1970 at St. Sylvesters. Those were the days when the school won the Stubbs Shield about eight times in 1960s and 70s.
Golden era of schools boxing
Recalling that golden era of schools boxing he mentioned the classy boxers he trained and fought with. LEWKE traded punches with the famous Bulner brothers from St. Sylvesters  Malcolm, Michael, Christopher and Noel, A.C.R Herathge, D.C.Weerasinghe, brothers G.A.S. and Derrick Gunasinghe, Jansz brothers, T.S. Hassen, M.Riyal, S. Aswer, D. John and others.
This glittering array of boxers, some of whom later went on to punch their way to winning at the nationals and representing the country at various International meets. Where are the likes of them now : this writer who covered some of the boxing meets where these boxers participated as a junior reporter at the Times of Ceylon asks. Those were the halcyon days of schools boxing that will never come again.
Concentrating on boxing
In school LEWKE did not play rugby, concentrating more on boxing. On closing school books he started his rugby that was to blossom and see a champion was at Kandy Sports Club. His first captain was that great prop forward Y.C. Chang and which club had players of the calibre of Gavin Stevens, Sunil Munasinghe, Kuthoos, Dr. Makuloluwa, Jeremy Perera, Deepal de Zoysa, Ranjan Rajendra, John Henry, George Jayasena, Samarajeewa, Gamini Udugama, Rohan Abeysundera, Chang Fa and others.
LEWKE was keen to join the Police and did so and rose in the ranks and nobody would have grumbled had he been made Inspector General of Police.
He later rose to be Commandant of the Special Task Force. He has the rare distinction of playing for the country and captaining the Police team that won the Clifford Cup in 1980.
Great players
That police team had great players such as E.K.R. Wijewardene, M. Moseth, Ibrahim Hamid, Rock Banda, Kularatne, R.P. Linton, Anton Benedict, Daya Jayasundera, Sunil Perera, Nimal Abeysinghe, Seevali Samarasekera, Somachandra, Samaraweera, Bandula Wijesinghe, Charles Wijewardene, T.P Hajireen, Nizam Hajireen, Dassanayake, Herath Banda and Chandrapala.
He played in four police teams that won the Clifford Cup in 1972 under Anton Benedict,73 under Nizam Hajireen.
I recall the 'Sunday Times' when M.V. Muhsin covered the cup final and we featured a colorful copy titled "Agony & Ecstasy of the Cup Final'. Then LEWKE played again under Charles Wijewardene in 1979 which won the Clifford Cup and in 1980 he led the team to honours. Muhsin later on went on to become Financial Adviser to the Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda and ended up being Chief Information Officer and Vice President of the World Bank.
LEWKE wielded the willow for the Police and played Sara Trophy cricket. Some of his team mates were T.B.Kehelgamuwa, G.S.Ratnayake, Franklyn Burke, Lal Wickrematunge and Anil Ratwatte. In addition to his prowess in boxing, rugby and cricket he was also a member of the champion Pistol Shooting Police team.
Glorious moments
But LEWKES most glorious moments was on the rugby scene. After he closed his chapter as active player in 1983, he turned to coaching and was national coach. He met with success as a coach at school level in 1994, 95 when St. Peters under his guidance entered the Presidents Trophy finals for the first time and later won the championship in 2001.
As head coach of St. Thomas College he guided them to be unbeaten schools league champions which stands as a record up to date. At top level coaching he has the unenviable record and in 1995 showed the way for Kandy Sports Club to pocket the triple crown for the first time  Clifford Cup, John Player League Trophy and Presidents Trophy. In 1996 and 97 KSC won the triple crown again and it is a record and unique for a coach to achieve success for three consecutive years.
Man of many parts
LEWKE is a man of many parts. He is a level 11 qualified coach from New South Wales, Australian Rugby Academy. He held the prestigious post of President of the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union in 2007/08 and during his reign he held the Rugby Asiad in Sri Lanka in 2007 where Sri Lanka emerged runners-up for the second time.
Those were the days when terrorism was at its zenith with foreign teams showing reluctance to come here.
As Commandant of the Special Task Force he convinced all teams that tight security will be provided at the Asian Rugby Football AGM in Hong Kong in 2006.
Due to his assurance the teams played here. The then President who was a keen rugby fan thanked him profusely for staging the Asiad here. Wasnt LEWKE elated. He has the proud record of being the second Sri Lankan to be appointed President of the Asian Rugby Football Union.
Leading rugby referee
LEWKE was a leading rugby referee for many years and blew with great aplomb and no questions were asked when he whistled the Bradby Shield, the Clifford Cup finals and the Presidents Trophy finals.
He was also President of the Sri Lanka Rugby Referees Society in 2003/04. He was Police Sportsman of the year in 1980. President Western Province/Rugby Football Union and in 2003 was President Junior Rugby Asiad Referees Society. During his tenure in every aspect of rugby not once did he accept any remuneration. He did it all for the love of the game.
His one disappointment was when he was removed as Chairman of the Sports Council which position was given to him by then Minister of Sport for a short while Navin Dissanayake. But for no reason was subsequently replaced by Dayasiri Jayasekera who took over as Sports Minister after Dissanayake left the Ministry.
LEWKE is now Chief Security Officer at Aitken Spence and President Maithripala Sirisena learning of his unlimited talent in security matters invited him to join his Security Division as an Adviser on Defence Affairs.
LEWKE based his success in all aspects on the adage that  if you have the will, there is a way. The likes of the unassuming LEWKE with his proud credentials will not surface that easy.

NIOE and ITC to conduct seminars on Dumping
The NCE welcomes the enactment of the Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties Act and the Safeguard Measures Act by the Government which was passed in parliament in March. The Chamber notes that these enactments fulfill the expectations of Sri Lankan Entrepreneurs to safeguard them from unfair trade practices, and to create a level playing field, which has been long overdue.
The Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties Act provides protection to domestic enterprises to counter low priced dumped imports, as well as imports which have received excessive subsidies, while the Safeguard Measures Act provides protection to local domestic enterprises against sudden surges of imports which are harmful to domestic industries.
The Chamber reiterates the statement made recently by the Ministry of Strategy Development and International Trade that these new laws are not aimed at providing blanket protectionism to domestic industry, but rather a credible set of remedial measures in the event of injury to domestic industry caused by dumping or by subsidies, as well as by sudden surges of imports
Some local entrepreneurs have been making representations in the past that imports are entering the country at lower prices than their normal value. However the Chamber notes that dumping is often mistaken and simplified to mean all cheap low priced imports, which is not the case. In this context representations have been made by local enterprises related to the imports of second hand low quality boats, and low quality electrical panel boards at low prices.
However a closer analysis of the issues related to these imports may require other remedial measures. A more realistic case as pointed out by the Department of Commerce at a recent Seminar could be the imports of low priced potatoes from India.
On the other hand in regard to Exports from Sri Lankathe Chamber notes that domestic enterprises in the USA have made representations to the US Department of Commerce regarding low priced certain types of off road pneumatic tires, and rubber bands from Sri Lanka which they claimed to receive subsidies in Sri Lanka.
Data of the World Trade Organization (WTO) reveals an increasing trend in complaints from affected enterprises in developed countries, as well as some developing countries. In this context there is a need for Sri Lankan exporters of various products to be aware of such sensitive export markets,to avoid issues.
The bills that have been passed in parliament clearly outline the special criteria to determine when Products are considered to be dumped or unfairly subsidized, and the provisions to levy compensatory duties. Further the website of the Department of Commerce in Sri Lanka also lists out the steps to be followed by Sri Lankan Enterprises who seek redress when reporting on dumped goods, subsidized imports and surges in imports, which entrepreneurs should be aware of.
WTO Regulations also provide certain flexibilities to developing countries when seeking redress under these laws.
The chamber recently conducted a Preliminary workshop, under the EU Trade Facilitation Project, through its affiliate training arm the National Institute of Exports (NIOE) to introduce key features of the legislation. The workshop was conducted with the assistance of the International Trade Center (ITC) in Geneva.
With a view to imparting further knowledge, and educating Sri Lankan Entrepreneurs on the various technical issues related to the above enactments, and the procedures they should follow when making an application to the Department of Commerce, which is the investigating authority, seeking redress under the legislation, the Chamber will shortly conduct Training Workshops in collaboration with the relevant state agencies.
Nevertheless the Chamber advices Sri Lankan Entrepreneurs to be alert and compile relevant information as well as data on their particular segments of industries, including the production data of producers of the same product, or like products,to facilitate their representations when seeking protection from unfair trade practices related to imports.

MR following Goebbels theory, while repeating lies written by someone else: Mangala
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who lived off public funds and ruled the country in a fascist manner, is now spreading lies about the countrys cost of living, whereas he did not know the cost of living during his government, Media and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said in Parliament yesterday.
He said Rajapaksa was following Goebbels' theory and repeating the lies written for him by someone else, adding that although he had challenged him to a debate in this regard, he had not responded to it.
However, Minister Samaraweera said he was glad that Rajapaksa is taking some interest in the countrys cost of living even at this point, presenting a comparison of the prices of essential items now and during the Rajapaksa regime. Samaraweera said during the Rajapaksa regime, the public was burdened with over 80% of the indirect taxes placed on them, while he was now promising to reduce taxes by 20%. However, he has not presented a mechanism on how he would implement this plan to reduce taxes.The Finance Minister further said, When we took over the government, a kilo of red rice was sold at Rs. 91, but today, it is between Rs. 85-86 per kilo. Samba was Rs. 97 and today it sells for Rs. 90. Sugar was Rs. 100, while today it sells at Rs. 108 per kilo. Potatoes was Rs. 104 per kilo earlier and today its Rs. 89, while coconuts have been reduced to Rs. 75. The majority of 90% of the population are not farmers, but we have granted concessions to the farmers. Today Mahinda Rajapaksa is trying to mislead the public by his false promises, but nowhere had he indicated how he proposes to reduce the indirect taxes by 20 percent. The Finance Minister pointed out that if the tax percentage is to be reduced, the scope of charging taxes and paying of taxes should be widened. Since the enforcement of the Inland Revenue Act from April 01, during the first month alone, 41,000 new tax files were opened within three weeks. Minister Mangala Samaraweera said this commencing the debate on notifications under the Excise Ordinance in Parliament yesterday. Under the Excise Ordinance, four notifications were taken up for debate. When taxes are reduced on one hand, indirect taxes should be increased on the other, said Samaraweera, adding that the percentage of direct and indirect taxes was the highest in Sri Lanka. By 2015, the government had only obtained 18% in direct taxes and there were only 400,000 direct tax files out of a population of 21 million. Both the rich and poor man paid the same indirect taxes. But if we are to change this system, we must broaden the taxation percentage. We need to change as a country. There are over 12% of those who do not pay taxes in comparison to those who do, he said.
He said that by 2020 as anticipated, if the direct taxes are increased, the VAT could be reduced by at least 2.5%. From 1950, the income of the government has been far lesser than the expenses. The budget deficit in 2015 was 829.5 billion, while he said it was expected to be reduced to 675 billion by this year, adding that it was one of the greatest victories of the government.
Samaraweera noted that in 2005, 41.02% of the entire income was obtained through the VAT, but by 2016, it was reduced to 16.02%. In 2016, the Excise Duty was 36% of the government income. But, during the Rajapaksa regime, it was only 22%. However, as a sensitive government, we have revised the taxes and we have exempted children under 18 from taxes. I urge Mahinda Rajapaksa to stop spreading lies and if he has a legitimate concern, he could present it. In the past when Karu Jayasuriya proposed the Right to Information, they opposed it being brought to Parliament, but ironically, today they are relying on the RTI for their information, he added.
Govt. to bear cost of interest on loans below Rs. 150,000 obtained by females: Mangala
The government would bear the cost of interest of loans below Rs. 150,000 obtained by females from Micro Finance Companies, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said yesterday. The special announcement with regard to this decision would be initiated on June 22, 2018, Minister Samaraweera said.
He also said the government is to take steps against officers attached to Micro Finance Companies who had sought sexual favours from debt ridden females. We have received reports, we are looking into the matter and we will take steps against such sexual harassments, Minister Samaraweera said.
Joining the Adjournment Motion moved by JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the ETI Finance issue, Minister Samaraweera also said that the debt crisis situation created by micro finance companies in rural areas was a tragic situation. These loan sharks have inflicted this issue especially in rural areas and districts affected by drought, such as Northern and North-Central regions. Most who fell for this debt trap were innocent women. They borrow a small amount of money at high interest rates and fell into trouble. Two elderly women had committed suicide unable to pay their debts. Young women who have obtained such loans are sexually harassed by officers of these finance companies, Minister Samaraweera said.
Speaking on the ETI finance crisis and similar cases that had taken place, Minister Samaraweera said that the government together with the officers of the Central Bank and the General Treasury would discuss on long term and short term measures that should be taken to avoid future similar situations. An impartial committee would be appointed to further study and forward proposals on the issue, he further said.
Minister Samaraweera observed that Micro Finance Companies accounts a total assets worth of Rs.1.395 Trillion, which was 7% of the entire financial system of the country. As at March 2018, these micro finance companies had provided Rs. 1,102 billion worth credit and leasing facilities, which was 79% of their total assets, he also pointed out. Minister Samaraweera also said the Central Bank would request these companies to adhere to a 30% gap on the interest rate on their lending.
Govt plans to establish 1000 MW wind and solar energy combined power plant in Pooneryn
Plans are afoot to establish a 1000 MW wind and solar energy combined power plant in Pooneryn, Power and Renewable Energy State Minister Ajith P.Perera said yesterday. He also said that land measurements for the project had already been completed.
Currently, we are looking into fulfilling legal requirements to the project. We will use competitive bidding as the procurement method when attracting investors, State Minister Perera said.
He also said that another wind power plant and a solar power plant generating 100 MW and 150 MW respectively, would be established within the next two months. Both local and foreign investors would be able to invest in these plants, he added.
State Minister Perera also said that the Cabinet has consented to an agreement to bring in a revision to the selling price of a unit of electricity generated from roof top solar panels if necessary.
Such decisions would be taken after reaching the solar capacity of 100 MW, State Minister Perera said. Solar panels are currently paid Rs. 22 per unit during the first seven years for excess power supplied to the grid and from the eighth year on wards, generators are paid Rs. 15.50.
In answer to a question by UNP backbencher Nalin Bandara, State Minister Perera said that a total of 135.35 MW power is added by solar panels to the national grid as at May 2018.
Education Minister tells Chief Ministers to stop meddling with provincial schools
Political interference in transferring, attaching and appointing principals to provincial schools is tragic, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said yesterday.
He urged the Chief Ministers of all Provincial Councils to put a stop to such political meddling. Minister Kariyawasam pointed out that the government had taken steps to curb political influence on National Schools and requested the provincial authorities to do the same.
There are many principals in these schools who were politically appointed. But as a Yahapalana government, we could not allow such appointments to be done in future, as we are adhering to specific recruitment policies, Minister Kariyawasam pointed out.
Some of these politically appointed principals influence parents to organize protests and demonstrations against administrative decisions. We will give priority to officers in Sri Lankas Principal Service as they are qualified and trained. If we dont, it is inappropriate, Minister Kariyawasam observed.
Govt. will not penalise CEB union workers: Ajith P. Perera
The government has no intention of taking revenge from CEB union workers who are fighting for their rights, said Power and Renewable Energy State Minister Ajith P. Perera in parliament yesterday.
He said that an impartial and fair trial will be held regarding the union leaders who have been interdicted and their issue would be resolved in a peaceful and fair manner.
The State Minister said the interdicted union leaders are from the UNP workers union, SLFP union and JVP union, adding that the investigation would be held a report will be called on August 19.
He said this in response to a question raised by the JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake on why the disciplinary inquiries of these interdicted workers is taking forever to be completed.
Dy Minister Ramanayake proposes committee responsible for sudden raids: COPE Chairman
At yesterdays COPE meeting, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake had proposed the establishment of a committee responsible for sudden raids, re-elected COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti said yesterday. COPE would take further steps on the proposal soon, he added.
JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti was re-appointed Chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) and SLFP Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna as Chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) yesterday.
Handunnetti was unanimously voted as COPE Chairman, proposed by MP Dayasiri Jayasekara and seconded by MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana. Alagiyawanna was unanimously voted as COPA Chairman, proposed by Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe and seconded by UNP MP Kavinda Jayawardena.
Handunnetti said the focus on the COPE meeting was on a list of institutes that would be summoned before COPE during the course of this month. He also said that they had discussed on a way to provide official information concerning COPE meetings to the media.
M. M. Ismail to take oaths as new UNF MP
According to a Parliament source, M.M. Ismail is scheduled to take oaths as a new MP this morning (08), before Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
Ismail would take oaths as a UNF MP. Ismail has been named to fill in the vacancy created by the resignation of M.H.M Navavi of the SLMC.
The Elections Commission gazetted the name of Ismail as a new MP and sent it to the Secretary General of Parliament Dhammika Dassanayake, the source further said. MP M.H.M. Navavi submitted his resignation from his position on May 23, 2018. Navavi was a National list MP of the United National Front and a member of All Ceylon Makkal Congress.
JVP wants President Secretary summoned to Parliament
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday, urged that the Presidents Secretary be summoned to Parliament in order to secure its reputation which was tarnished by rumors on the Treasury Bond Commission report.
MP Dissanayake said that Presidents Secretary could then provide the required details on the Bond Commission report.
There have been all sorts of rumours. Now the number of MPs who allegedly took money from those who are involved in the bond scam have risen from 118 to 166. Some allege that they were given cheques too. We need to get these clarified. MP Dissanayake said.
Dissanayake also requested for the documents C1-C349 which are annexed to the Bond Commission report, be handed over to Parliament as well.
Mushrooming micro finance companies should be regulated: Dayasiri Jayasekara
SLFP MP Dayasiri Jayasekara urged the government to establish a department for the regulation of micro finance companies which are mushrooming throughout the country.
Some of the rural women are provided livelihood training and when they finish their training, they are unable to start their own business and they obtain loans from these micro finance companies. When they are unable to pay their loans obtained from one institution, they obtain another loan from another to meet their interest payments. Eventually, they get into a major debt trap and end up in deep trouble. Eventually, they lose even their homes, he said.
He said that there was no mechanism in the country to regulate these loan schemes and also individual money lenders. Those who obtain loans from these unregulated institutions, eventually lose everything and end up by committing suicide, when they find no way out of it.
Therefore, he said the government could use the Samurdhi network in the country to regulate these micro finance companies and money lenders.
Jayasekara further noted that by removing the taxes on gold, gold prices in the country had dropped drastically, creating a whole range of issues. A large amount of gold had been imported, but there was no evidence of any additional benefit for the country. There was no mechanism to find out who was importing gold, while a large amount of gold had also gone out of the country. Now there is a huge network smuggling gold between India and Sri Lanka. Therefore, a proper mechanism should be implemented to streamline these mechanisms to make them beneficial to the country, Jayasekara noted.

President calls for mechanism to cover absent teachers duties
President Maithripala Sirisena noted that there should be a proper mechanism to cover the duties of teachers who are on leave.
The President urged relevant authorities to introduce a suitable mechanism to carry out educational activities of schools without obstruction due to absent teachers.
The President was speaking at a ceremony to recruit 500 graduate teachers to the Western Province, at the Nelum Polukna Theatre, yesterday.
President Sirisena had come to know that 1,500 female teachers are on maternity leave annually from the Western Province alone. In addition, a significant number of teachers go abroad annually and another considerable number of teachers are not deployed for teaching due to various issues relating to mental health. However, as this situation causes a severe impact on the smooth function of school education, the President advised authorities to introduce a suitable mechanism.
Addressing the newly appointed teachers, the President noted that teachers are duty-bound to create a knowledgeable society since a knowledge society is a must to develop the country. The President added that a knowledgeable and educated society plays a key role in the development of the country.
The President while highlighting the value of latest knowledge, said teachers should be up to date as sometimes, students are far better than the teacher, knowledge wise.
In this ever-advancing world, it is common to see that certain students are more knowledgeable. Students are keen on seeking knowledge by using modern technology. Then teachers too should cultivate a flair to hunt for knowledge, the President said.
The government will provide all facilities for school teachers to enable them to have a conducive condition mentally to provide a sound education to students, President Sirisena said. He said the commitment made by teachers to nurture children with knowledge is not limited to their salaries, because the teaching profession is the best profession in the world.
The President said students should qualify, not only by overcoming various academic barriers and passing examinations, but should also achieve success in the journey of life.
One of the prime objectives of the government is to provide the maximum educational benefits to students, President Sirisena said. The President said education is not merely gaining qualifications but also inculcating citizens with values for the benefit of the country.
President Sirisena said students have to use modern technology as part of their progress. The President requested students to make the best out of modern technology in a productive manner.

Public servants housing issue being addressed now - Minister
Public servants are no different to politicians when they are being criticised by the people, Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said yesterday.
He said that the people tend to criticize politicians at the slightest mistake vehemently despite services rendered to the country by them.
Likewise public servants too are criticised vehemently, Minister Ranjith Bandara said.
The Minister said these observations during a discussion on the progress of the Nila Piyasa Housing Scheme for public servants. He said public servants too are facing a housing issue. He added that after the late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike attempted to address this issue by way of Summit Flats, no other government had focused attention to the issue thereafter. He said the government was addressing the issue with the Nila Piyasa Housing Scheme.
The first phase of this scheme was initiated in Moneragala and Kelaniya.The next phase will begin on June 12 at Colombo 7.
This government has done many changes including increasing the salary of public servants, reducing the price of commodities, establishing independent commissions, establishing media freedom and bringing corruption to an end, Bandara said. But people criticize the government even for a small mistake. In the same manner public servants are criticized badly.
He also said but there should be a way to appreciate the public servants too. This is such a means that the government attempt to encourage the public servants, Minister Bandara said.

Ride to Your Facebook Page..!
Was watching a husband and wife squabbling quite loudly on the beach a month ago, when the husband seeing a coconut tree which lent itself to a great background for a picture, whipped out his phone, and shouted Selfie! Immediately the harsh, angry face of the wife composed itself into a pretty coy one, as the husband put a hand round his wifes shoulders and like a couple intensely in love the picture was taken. The next moment their expressions went back to fight mode, voice pitch went up even as the husband fiddled with his phone, obviously sending the picture hurtling to his Facebook page.
I would have loved to see that page, and the comments from friends as they viewed the lovey-dovey couple: You guys still in love!
Second honeymoon!
What a great couple, happiness overflowing!
You are a role model to everyone with your true love!
If only those commentators had seen the couple before and after the shot. Or does everyone know that the page only meant to portray joy and happiness. Its like a they lived happily ever after page.
But in reality, instead of creating happy memories for themselves on the beach they are enacting them for their friends on social media. I looked at the couple after they had taken that lovely pic and wondered why they had come to this holiday destination, was it because a marriage counselor had told them to take a vacation together Was it because they had found that circumstances of home and job had made them stray from each other and this was a chance to rekindle a dying fire But it wasnt happening because hugs, holds and happiness was reserved only for the page, while derision, disdain and despair was reality.
I imagine I call out to that couple, Im going to take you for a ride! I say.
Where ask the husband and wife.
Into Facebook! I tell them, as they get onto the flying buggy Mark Zuckerberg has leant me. We fly into Facebook and I see pictures of both of them in the most loveable poses coming alive, Thats us they gasp. Yes! I tell them, Thats you on Facebook! Thats what your friends are seeing at this moment!
You mean they can see us now asks the wife quickly putting her hands in her husbands while he holds her tight. Yes! I say, as I get into the buggy and get ready to ride back. I watch as suddenly theres laughter from them and smiles on their faces and they walk together happy.
Its a great place to go to, I think to myself, lets just get into Zuckerbergs buggy and take a ride into our Facebook pages and have a great holiday there. Im sure well come back realizing our Facebook pages can become pages of our life, and do I hear Zuckerbergs buggy horses neighing in agreement

## Title: Save Our Oceans

Save Our Oceans
Just last week, we heard the devastating news that a whale which had ingested 80 plastic bags had died after washing ashore in Thailand. Statistically, this may be just one animal but if you look at the bigger picture, our oceans are filled to the brim with garbage, especially plastics. Sri Lanka, which has a relatively large coastline and an extended maritime boundary, is in the unenviable fifth position out of 200 countries in terms of marine plastic pollution despite having a population of only 21 million.
Just a few days ago, the world was reminded of this catastrophe on the World Environment Day. Today, on World Oceans Day (June 8), we have yet another opportunity to resolve to save our seas. The oceans are the lungs of our planet, providing most of the oxygen we breathe. They are a major source of food and medicines and a critical part of the biosphere. In the end, it is a day to celebrate together the beauty, wealth and promise of the vast ocean which covers more than 70 percent of the planets surface.
The worlds oceans  their temperature, chemistry, currents and life  drive global systems that make the Earth habitable for humankind. Our rainwater, drinking water, weather, climate, coastlines, much of our food, and even the oxygen in the air we breathe, are ultimately provided and regulated by the sea. Throughout history, oceans and seas have been vital conduits for trade and transport. Careful management of this essential global resource is a key feature of a sustainable future. Yet, we still care and know very little about the oceans. They contain nearly 200,000 identified species, but actual numbers may lie in the millions and there are many other mysteries that surround the worlds oceans.
Oceans cover three quarters of the Earths surface, contain 97 per cent of the Earths water, and represent 99 per cent of the living space on the planet by volume. Over three billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods. Globally, the market value of marine and coastal resources and industries is estimated at $3 trillion per year or about 5 per cent of global GDP. Oceans absorb about 30 per cent of carbon dioxide produced by humans, buffering the impacts of global warming.
Oceans serve as the worlds largest source of protein, with more than 2.6 billion people depending on the oceans as their primary source of protein. Marine fisheries directly or indirectly employ over 200 million people. Subsidies for fishing are contributing to the rapid depletion of many fish species and are preventing efforts to save and restore global fisheries and related jobs, causing ocean fisheries to generate US$ 50 billion less per year than they could. As much as 40 per cent of the world oceans are heavily affected by human activities, including pollution, depleted fisheries, and loss of coastal habitat.
The focus of World Oceans Day 2018 is preventing plastic pollution and encouraging solutions for a healthy ocean. Plastic pollution is causing tremendous harm to our marine resources. Some of the statistics are indeed alarming - 80% of all pollution in the ocean comes from people on land; 8 million tonnes of plastic per year ends up in the ocean, wreaking havoc on wildlife, fisheries and tourism; Plastic pollution costs the lives of 1 million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals per year; Plastic causes $8 billion in damage to marine ecosystems each year. By 2050, it is estimated the ocean will contain more plastic by weight than fish.
As always, prevention is better than the cure - there are many things we can do as individuals to reduce our plastic consumption in the first place. The key is to use less plastic and recycle the plastic we must use in line with the 3R mantra  Reduce, Re-Use and Recycle. There is a raging debate overseas about the possibility of banning some plastics such as single-use straws and cups. (India is planning to ban single use plastics by 2022 while Kenya already has a ban in place).
Nearly one billion straws are used and discarded around the world every day, with most of them ending up in the oceans. One can imagine the sheer scale of the straw problem from this statistic alone. If you think you can manage to drink a beverage without a straw, do so. There is now a worldwide movement that aims to drastically reduce straw use. Moreover, given a choice between a PET bottle and a glass bottle, opt for the glass bottle. When you go to a restaurant, ask your server to bring water in a glass, not in a plastic bottle. Always use a recyclable bag when you go shopping. If you live near the sea, make sure that none of your garbage gets to the sea. As a rule, never leave anything other than your footprints on a beach. Remember, the ocean is not a dumping ground for our waste. It is a living, breathing entity that deserves our respect, care and support.

Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage:
Sri Lanka in UNESCO Committee
Sri Lanka was elected to one of four seats available for the Asia-Pacific, in the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, for 2018 - 2022.
An election was held in Paris during the seventh General Assembly of the UNESCO on Wednesday.
The Foreign Affairs Ministry said eight countries from the Asia - Pacific group are Bangladesh, China, Japan, Kazakhstan,Thailand, Malaysia, Palau and Sri Lanka.With Palau withdrawing its candidature, seven countries stood for election.
The countries elected are China, Sri Lanka, Japan and Kazakhstan, securing 123, 122, 107 and 98 votes respectively.
The Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, which became a milestone in the evolution of international policies for promoting cultural diversity, was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO in 2003 at its 32nd session.
Recognizing the need to safeguard the traditions and living expressions among communities in Sri Lanka as well as in other countries, which are inherited from ancestors such as oral traditions, performing arts, social practices, rituals, festivals, knowledge and practices concerning nature, and knowledge and skills to produce traditional crafts, Sri Lanka became a State Party to the Convention in 2008.This is the first time that Sri Lanka contested for a seat in the Committee since becoming a State Party to the Convention.
Sri Lanka recognises that intangible cultural heritage is an important factor in maintaining cultural diversity in the face of growing globalisation and that an understanding of the intangible cultural heritage of different communities helps promote intercultural dialogue and encourages mutual respect for other ways of life.
The decision to seek election to the Committee at this juncture is driven by the governments commitment to the process of reconciliation through which Sri Lanka endeavours to preserve and promote ancient traditions of all communities while fostering respect and understanding of each others ways of life, practices, customs and traditions.
Sri Lanka is deeply appreciative of the invaluable support received from all the States Parties to the Convention that enabled Sri Lankas success at this election, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said in the statement.

He further submitted that this state minister had got his second cheque of Rs 1 million on November 12 and the third cheque on March 31, 2016.
Kodagoda submitted that following the incident the Sub Inspector (the state ministers security officer) had given a statement to the FCID.
The Magistrate ordered the further remand of Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena until June 21 yesterday.

School standards have dropped due to poor coaching:
Tillakaratne hoping to end Lankas U19 World Cup win drought
Former Sri Lanka Test captain and member of Sri Lankas 1996 World Cup winning side Hashan Tillakaratne said that he wants to build a Sri Lanka under 19 team as strong as the one that toured England in 1986 which included three Test players  Asanka Gurusinha (who captained the side), Roshan Jurangpathy and Sanjeewa Weerasinghe.
We had a very strong side at that time and I want to do the same slowly and steadily with the present cricketers. I want to teach them their technical part as well as the practical part, Tillakaratne told the Daily News.
I have given a short term plan to Sri Lanka Cricket that our under 17 cricketers should play in our domestic Sara trophy which is two-day matches. The Under 19ers I have requested for them to play in our under 23 tournament  3-day games and in our Premier one-day tournament, he said.
I am hoping to put out separate sides so that I can work with them individually. I am not in a hurry I want to prepare them for the 2020 Under19 World Cup. I am looking at their technical part as well as their practical part and I will try and do my level best.
Tillakaratne was also one of the members of that Sri Lanka Youth side that toured England in 1986 along with Chandika Hathurusingha. They both went onto play for Sri Lanka with distinction.
Comparing the standard of school cricket at the time when he played for DS Senanayake College and today, Tillakaratne said that the standards had dropped and need to be improved.
We used to float around. I played about six seasons for DS Senanayake first eleven from the age of 14. We were given opportunities to improve our skills by playing in the first eleven team so that by the time you leave college at about 18 you are very mature and have the maturity of a 23 or 24 year-old, said Tillakaratne. Today an under 19 boy who represented Sri Lanka cannot even get into a top under 23 club side. The standard has dropped. We need to improve our structure by giving them more opportunities to improve themselves.
POOR COACHING
Tillakaratne attributed the decline in standards to poor coaching.
Its more to do with poor coaching. We were very lucky to have gone through coaches like WAN Silva, PW Perera, Nelson Mendis, Lionel Mendis and Raja Athukorale. Monetary gains were not important to them, they had the passion and they wanted to coach players, pointed out Tillakaratne who represented his country in 83 Tests and 200 One-Day Internationals between 1986 and 2004 and played in four World Cups (1992, 1996, 1999 and 2003). Todays coaches are more concerned about results than improving the technical part of the players. They want to win games, if we can yes, thats also very important because we all know if you dont win you will lose the job. But at the same time they must also look at the career of the players. If you have to be successful in the system you have to be technically sound.
Prior to taking over his new appointment as Sri Lanka under 19 head coach, Tillakaratne had worked with the Under 16 side as batting coach as well helping former coach Roy Dias prepare the under 19 team for the 2018 World Cup for about 2-3 weeks.
Working with these youngsters I came across so many technical faults and we need to work on them. We have to be patient with the boys and correct them, talk to them nicely so that they could understand their faults, said Tillakaratne.
The players are very skillful and talented the only thing is if they are to be successful they have to play against stronger and better sides. In my schooldays I had the privilege of playing with Ranjan Madugalle, Rumesh Ratnayake, Ravi Ratnayeke and AmaI Silva at NCC. I was given the opportunity to play against the best sides at division I Sara level. We must try and give the players stiff opposition so that they will improve themselves.
If you look at our school cricket structure we need to improve it. I am sure the schools cricket association is doing their level best but still I think its not good enough, Tillakaratne continued. There is a bit of a communication gap between Sri Lanka Cricket and the Schools Cricket Association. We need to sit with them and talk and get their support.
LESS PRESSURE UNLIKE TODAY
Tillakaratne (50) was renowned for being a technically sound left-hand middle order batsman who began his international career as a wicket-keeper but later turned out to be an outstanding close-in fielder as well. Despite being recognized more for his obdurate batting in Test matches where he had played many memorable and match saving innings for his team Tillakaratne still managed to find a place in the one-day side as well.
We didnt have that much pressure when we were playing because we had a superb one-day as well as a Test side. Today because we are playing in three formats everyone is under pressure and expecting results to win all the games. We didnt have that much pressure when we were playing, we enjoyed the game and the company, said Tillakaratne. We knew our strong points as well as our weaknesses. We had rest days between matches so that we can go back to the drawing board and correct ourselves if we are doing any mistakes. Today every other day we have a match.
Playing under Arjuna (Ranatunga) we were given responsibilities and I was one of them. We were not too keen about our personal milestones but just that we were ready to play and bat at any number. I was batting at no. 6 and at times I went down to no. 9. Whatever the team required we were prepared to do it, Tillakaratne continued.
Luckily we had two superb openers in Kalu (Romesh Kaluwitharana) and Sanath (Jayasuriya) and with Arjuna batting at no. 5 the responsibility and pressures were taken away from us. Sometimes I didnt get to bat.
Tillakaratne said the key factor in Sri Lanka winning the 1996 World Cup was the experience and playing as a team. Everyone knew what their roles were and they helped each other they knew their strong and weak points. Tillakaratne who is a qualified Level II and III Global ICC qualified coach is currently coaching the Galle side that is due to play Colombo in the Super Provincial 50-over final at the R Premadasa Stadium on Sunday. He coached them to finish runner-up last year and he was also till recently the batting coach of the Sri Lanka team.
Tillakaratnes immediate goal is preparing the under 19 players for three important series during the year.
We are expecting India Under 19 to be here on July 10 for two 4-day games and 5 ODIs, the Bangladesh Under 19 here in October also for two 4-day tests and 5 ODIs and we are expected to go to the Under 19 Asia Cup to India in December, said Tillakaratne. My immediate focus is to prepare the players for these series but the ultimate goal is the World Cup which we are working towards. My first goal is to reach the first four of the World Cup and work it on from there. If we can win the World Cup, all the problems will be sorted.
Sri Lanka has never won the Under 19 Cricket World Cup their best performance being runner-up to India in 2000 when it was played in Colombo.

Shut down of TNL transmission:
TRCSL reasons at odds with Networks head
There are disparities between the information provided by the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) notification as to why measures were taken to stop the transmission operations of a repeater tower at Polgahawela and seize their equipment and the reasons given by the head of Telshan Networks Limited (TNL) Shan Wickremesinghe and a comprehensive investigation will be held into the incident,said Media and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
He said this in Parliament yesterday in response to a question raised by JVPMP Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the current status with regard to the order to shut down the TNL repeater tower in Polgahawela.
Issuing a statement yesterday, the TRC Director General P.R.S.P. Jayathilake stated that the TV transmission operated by Telshan Network (Pvt) Ltd is presently licensed for 9 locations throughout the country namely Colombo, Nuwara Eliya (Mt. Oliphant), Karagahatenna, Piliyandala, Awissawella, Badulla, Gongala, Hantana and Ratnapaura. However, although they had obtained the license for the above nine locations, the licence for the Polgahawela repeater tower had not been obtained.
The TRCSL said it has informed Telshan Network (Pvt) Ltd to shut down this illegal transmission on April 27, 2016. But, TNL had ignored the notice of the TRC and therefore, the TRC said they had been compelled to take action against TNL based on the above grounds, and emphasized that there was no hidden agenda behind this action, the statement said.
However, TNL is also expected to take legal action against the move, on the basis that they had been charged unfairly.

Vigilance vital
Influenza has a less significant place in the public imagination in our generation to consider it to be life threatening although in the history it has been pandemic in some instances. However the recent outbreak of influenza in Southern Province stirred the country causing devastation to several families.Top health experts say this recent health scare is dying down but it is wiser to be well-informed about these unpredictable viruses and take precautions.
Seasonal Influenza
Seasonal influenza viruses circulate and cause disease in humans every year. In Sri Lanka, for the last few years, it has been generally observed during April to June and again in November to January.
According to World Health Organisation (WHO) influenza spreads from person-to-person through sneezing, coughing, or touching contaminated surfaces. Seasonal influenza viruses can cause mild to severe illness and even death, particularly in some high-risk individuals. Persons at increased risk for severe disease includes pregnant women, the very young and very old, immune-compromised people, and people with chronic underlying medical conditions such as cancer, diabetes mellitus and heart diseases.
There are three types of seasonal influenza viruses, types A, B, and C. Influenza type A viruses are further classified into sub types according to the combinations of 2 different proteins, the haemagglutinin (H) and the neuraminidase (N), located on the surface of the virus. The sub types of influenza A viruses currently circulating among humans are influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) sub types. The circulating influenza A (H1N1) is also written as A(H1N1) pdm09 as it caused the pandemic in 2009 and subsequently replaced the seasonal influenza A(H1N1) virus which had circulated prior to 2009. Only influenza type A viruses are known to have caused pandemics.
Sri Lanka situation
The Medical Research Institute (MRI) confirmed Influenza A virus was found in most samples tested since May 1 and out of a total of 159 samples (swabs) were received from the Karapitiya Hospital most of them were of children. The institute also said Adino virus and RSV are also found.
However Epidemiology Unit Director, Health Ministry, Dr Anil Dissanayake said the number of `Influenza A patients admitted to the hospitals in the Southern Province had significantly reduced recording only 130 to 140 admissions per day. "Yet we are vigilant of the outbreak of influenza. We are collecting statistics and have alerted every hospital in the country providing them guidelines of curative and preventive methods," Dr Dissanayake said.
He added the Health Ministry has catered to the needs of extra medical staff, funds and medicine. "Several pediatric specialists have been assigned to Karapitiya Hospital which has the only Pediatric Intensive Care Unit in the province. The government has allocated more funds to purchase drugs and other requirements to control the viral flu," he explained.
Dr. Dissanayake commended the efforts of the hospital staff in those areas working tirelessly to treat every patient. "This is a seasonal influenza which we have been experiencing in the past years as well. Seasonal influenza outbreaks are experienced all over the world. However this year we experienced an increase in the number of patients infected. Throughout the year Epidemiology Unit conducts surveillance covering the whole island. The appointed Advisory Committee then makes projections and gear up to face any possible outbreak. The slight increase of influenza infected people, the country experienced in the month of April continued through May as well, he said.
Dr. Dissanayake pointed out the influenza which was all over the country last year was confined to Southern Province this time. However we cannot confine a viral disease to one geographical area. The nature of the virus is fast spreading. Influenza is a clinically diagnosed and is a simple flu like illness which can be contracted by number of people, he said.
Epidemiology Unit Director advised people to take precautions to minimize the spreading of influenza. We urge people not to visit patients who are in hospitals in large numbers and to avoid public gatherings, he said.
Meanwhile, Southern Province Health Services Director, Dr. G Wijesuriya confirmed that the trend experienced during the past months is declining. Even though patients infected are still being admitted there is a decline in the trend. There is no need to panic as the situation is under control. We are in continuous dialogue with Health Ministry officials and other concerned parties and have received their fullest co-operation, he said.
Dr. Wijesuriya assured that all hospitals are equipped with necessary drugs and the Cabinet has granted approval to purchase any other requirement without tender procedure to control the influenza. Meanwhile more staff who completed their training has been assigned to hospitals. Both the President and Health Minister have looked into requirements to expand the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of the Karapitiya Hopsital and more pediatric specialists have also been assigned, Provincial Director explained.
Taking precautions
Director Health Promotion Bureau and former Chief Epidemiologist, Dr. Paba Palihawadana explained the preventive methods that should be followed.
Seasonal influenza spreads easily, with rapid transmission in crowded areas including schools and nursing homes. When an infected people cough or sneeze where infectious droplets containing viruses are dispersed into the air and will in turn infect persons in close proximity who breathe these droplets in. The virus can also be spread by hands contaminated with influenza viruses. To prevent transmission, people should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing, and wash their hands regularly, Dr Palihawadana said.
She said apart from vaccination and antiviral treatment, the public health management includes personal protective measures. Regular hand washing with proper drying of the hands, covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, using tissues and disposing of them correctly and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth is important to prevent from contracting the virus, she said.
Early self-isolation of those feeling unwell, feverish and having other symptoms of influenza and avoiding close contact with sick people is also vital. Some characteristic of the seasonal influenza are sudden onset of fever, cough, headache, muscle and joint pain, feeling unwell, sore throat and a runny nose. The cough can be severe and can last two or more weeks, Dr Palihawadana explained.
In industrialized countries most deaths associated with influenza occur among people age 65 or older while the effects of seasonal influenza epidemics in developing countries are not fully known, but research estimates that 99 per cent of deaths in children under five years of age with influenza are related to lower respiratory tract infections.
Dr Palihawadana said patients infected should take adequate rest and be given warm fluids and plenty of nutrition. Children, if infected, should not attend school or tuition classes but should rest at home. It will prevent the virus spreading to others and will also do well in their recovery. If they have lost appetite children can be given frequent meals in smaller portions than forcing them to have a full meal, she explained.
Finding the solution
Seasonal influenza viruses evolve continuously, which means that people can get infected multiple times throughout their lives. Therefore the components of seasonal influenza vaccines are generally reviewed biannually and updated periodically to ensure continued effectiveness of the vaccines. Variability of influenza viruses makes it difficult to design universally effective drugs and vaccines. Recently, the National Drug Regulatory Authority of Sri Lanka has given license for the use of seasonal influenza (flu) vaccine.
Although this vaccine is registered a panel of scholars and experts has been appointed to look into the possibility of using the flu vaccine.
The scholarly panel which includes pediatricians, gynecologists, virologists, epidemiologists, and representatives from the Medical Supplies Division etc will decide whether to use the vaccine or not, when, to whom and how.
Health authorities said however a country cannot rely on a flu vaccine but should take preventive methods of maintaining personal hygiene to control infections. Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said in Parliament that the government is ready to distribute the influenza vaccine at any given time. Nevertheless the Health Ministry is awaiting the approval of National Technical Committee on Influenza to do so.
Troubled education
As Southern Province was crippled with this health scare Provincial Education Minister Chandima Rasaputra on the advice of specialists took steps to close primary schools in eight education zones and preschools due to the spread of influenza.
Minister said although the schools reopened the attendance is still low. We reopened the schools last Wednesday (May 30) but have seen attendance in lesser numbers. There was a low percentage in attendance especially of children in primary classes. Secondary was not bad but still not up to satisfactory. Still fears of infection prevail and parents compel to keep their children at home, Minister Rasaputra said.
He added that the assurance of the declining trend of influenza should come from health experts. Im discussing with the Ministry of Health how to tackle this situation. The assurance should come from health experts not from us. Specialists should go to schools or distribute a leaflet and educate and take measures to wipe out the fears of the public especially those who are residing in close proximity to the hospitals, Minister explained.
The unpredictable nature of influenza presents a challenge for both research and preparedness planning. However a rapid and expansive influenza surveillance and response network will widen the capacity of tackling the ever-shifting landscape of influenza evolution.
[High risk groups]
All age groups can be affected by this ever-changing virus but there are groups that are more at risk than others.
People at greater risk of severe disease or complications when infected are: pregnant women, children under 2 years, the elderly, individuals with chronic medical conditions (such as chronic cardiac, pulmonary, renal, metabolic, neurodevelopmental, liver or hematologic diseases) and individuals with immunosuppressive conditions (such as HIV/AIDS, receiving chemotherapy or steroids, or malignancy).
Health care workers are at high risk acquiring influenza virus infection due to increased exposure to the patients and risk further spread particularly to vulnerable individuals.
World Health Organisation recommends patients who are not from a high risk group to get symptomatic treatment and to stay home in order to minimize the risk of infecting others in the community. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms of influenza such as fever. Patients should monitor themselves to detect if their condition deteriorates and seek medical attention. Patients that are known to be in a group at high risk for developing severe or complicated illness should be treated with antivirals in addition to symptomatic treatment as soon as possible.

War hero's 103-year-old Cadbury chocolate bars found
A World War One hero's 103-year-old chocolate bars have been found in an old tin. The Cadbury bars belonged to Leicestershire Regiment soldier Richard Bullimore.
Troops serving in France during the first Christmas in the war were given Colonies Gift Tins, which were made in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire Bullimore, a corporal, ate just one of his ten chocolate bars, which are to be sold among other items at an antiques auction on Tuesday.
Paul Cooper, of Scunthorpe-based auctioneers Eddisons CJM, told the BBC, "Even the tin is rare but to find the chocolate still inside is just unreal. Richard also received a Princess Mary tobacco gift box containing cigarettes, tobacco and matches and almost all of the contents of that are still there too. Just three cigarettes are missing."
Also being sold in a collection of World War One paraphernalia are medals, citations, letters, and other material. Together, as a single lot, the collection is expected to make more than 2,000.
Cpl Bullimore was awarded a number of medals for his service.
He was given the Distinguished Conduct Medal for conspicuous gallantry during a clash in no man's land in the Ypres Salient in July 1915.
Despite being outnumbered by more than three to one, Cpl Bullimore and his patrol attacked with grenades, causing enemy casualties and eventually forcing the Germans to retreat.
The hero then carried one of his wounded men back to the allied trenches for treatment.
In October 1916, Cpl Bullimore was invalided back home due to shrapnel head wounds. He was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal.
Cpl Bullimore recovered and went on to join Leicestershire Police in 1919. There, he rose to the rank of superintendent.
The veteran died in January 1967.

Whales and dolphins  grieve for their dead
Whales and dolphins have trouble letting go of their loved ones and hold 'vigils' for the deceased.
That's according to a new study that claims these majestic creatures mourn the death of their friends and family in a similar way to humans.
In the wild, they have been being spotted clinging to the lifeless bodies of their offspring for days while protecting them from predators.
Researchers from Dolphin Biology and Conservation at Oceancare in Cordenons, Italy, analysed 78 records of aquatic mammals' treatment of their dead between 1970 and 2016. More than 90 per cent of the dolphins studied were attentive to their dead, with grieving females making up three quarters of these interactions.
Seventy five per cent of the incidents were of adult females looking after their dead calf, with some of them carrying decomposing bodies for up to a week.
The behaviour often involved one or more individuals attending to the deceased.
They attempted to keep the dead creature afloat if it sank or pushed it down if it was too buoyant, even performing 'resuscitation' attempts.
Researchers spotted mothers seeming to grieve for other females in the group. They also observed this touching behaviour in one pod of whales with the corpse of a male adult who may have died after a fight. Researchers wrote in their paper, published in Zoology, that an explanation of this behaviour could be 'strong attachment resulting in a difficulty of "letting go"-possibly related to grieving'.
They said the practice of postmorten attentive behaviour (PAB) could be because individuals had failed 'to recognise or accept that an offspring or companion has died'.
PAB was documented in 20 of 88 cetacean species, of which only one was a mysticete [whale].
Researchers believe it is more common in dolphins as they have more 'excess brain mass' and higher levels of sociality than whales.
'Mysticete species had a particularly low occurrence of PAB and, perhaps more tellingly, none was reported toward calves', researchers wrote in the paper.
'The only observation of mysticete PAB was in the... group of humpback whales which an adult male that died possibly during a competitive interaction'.
Humpback whales are known to protect their calf and fight back when attacked by killer whales.
In 2016, scientists found several cases where mammals clung to the bodies of dead compatriots, and kept vigil over a dead companion. At the time, they said the most likely explanation was mourning.
'The present study helps to corroborate that adults mourning their dead young is a common and globally widespread behaviour in long-lived and highly sociable/cohesive species of mammals,' the researchers from University of Milano-Bicocca in Italy wrote in the Journal of Mammalogy. The study compiled observations from 14 events.
They found mothers often carried their dead young above the water, often flanked by friends.
In many cases, the dead offspring were decomposed, indicating they had been held for a long time.
'We found it is very common, and [there is] a worldwide distribution of this behaviour,' study co-author Melissa Reggente told National Geographic's Traci Watson.
'They are in pain and stressed. They know something is wrong.'

Women in local government
It has been close to four months since the Local Government Elections were held with a 25 percent quota for women. For the first time in the countrys history, over 2,526 women entered the halls of local councils around the country. In some, it was the first time that a woman member sat in its chambers.
As a whole, the quota system managed to increase the number of women in local government from a mere 2 percent to 29 percent. Political parties had fielded 17,128 women candidates as a result of the quota this year. The question now is, how will these pioneering women change the system And have they been equipped to do so
Last week, a group of women who had been elected to local government bodies gathered at Janaki Hotel, Colombo, to discuss the issues and challenges they face, having fought for over 25 years to get representation in these councils.
The councillors, from the Central, Northern, Eastern, Western, Southern, Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces, who were earlier trained by various civil society groups, NGOs and individual lobbyists like the International Movement Against All Forms of Discrimination and Racism (IMADR) Sri Lanka, Womens Rights Activist Dr. Nimalka Fernando, and Centre for Women and Development Executive Director Saroja Sivachandran, were now back to discuss their next challenge - how to move forward from here.
From talk to action
For many of the women, this is their first time in public office or, for that matter, the first time in anything political. Though the 25 percent quota for women in local government was passed in Parliament in February 2016, few parties took notice of it until Local Government Elections were actually called two years later. This inevitably led to a last-minute scramble to convince women in the area, regardless of their political experience or qualifications, to run for public office. However, it must also be noted that given the substantial increase in the number of candidates this year, the quality of male candidates coming into the fray has also not been up to the mark.
I do not have the sufficient knowledge or information to make decisions within the council. I am also not aware of many of the legal matters. It is now that I am learning, said Chavakachcheri Pradeshiya Sabha TNA member Paulina Subhodini. A first time member, Subhodini said she was eager to work for the people in her constituency and knew of their issues, but her greatest challenge was getting those issues resolved within the framework of the council.
Her concerns were echoed by many of the councillors, who stated that they needed more training in the laws of the council and how it really worked.
Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha member Saraswathi said this was the first time a woman member had entered the council. Our area is full of women working in every sector, from the estates to the factories, but there were no women in the council. None spoke of the issues women in the area faced until now, she said.
Having worked in the community for many years, Saraswathi reiterated that she knew of the problems the people in the area faced, but when she looked to solve them, she was limited by legislation, jurisdiction and funding. How do we present these problems to the council in a way we are heard she asked.
Looking for alternatives
TNA member Mallika from the Manthai West Pradeshiya Sabha, was able to overcome the lack of funding for her projects through appeals to the local TNA MP. I needed to start a womens organisation in the area and we had to clean some wells. So I spoke to our MP Shanthi Sriskantharajah and she helped us, she said.
Having entered the Pradeshiya Sabha through the additional list, she complained that many people outside of the council did not think they were as capable as members who had contested their seats.
Her strategy, however, was seen to be short-termed. Many councillors complained that they could not always go to their local MPs. Further, it was harder for them to get things done when they were in the opposition. At this years Local Government Elections, many councils recorded a landslide victory for one party.
Biyagama Pradeshiya Sabha UNP member Mali Algamuwa complained that in her council, there were 30 members in the ruling party and just 13, including her, in the opposition. They act like they dont need us. We dont get any money allocated for our projects. If we ask for money in January, it goes through all the procedures and red tape, and it is June when it is finally passed. It is too late by then. The people are disappointed in us. They dont understand how the system works, she said
This is not the first time Algamuwa is a councillor in the Pradeshiya Sabha, and she observed that for newcomers it was difficult to even get a council labourer to do some work. You have to spend money to bribe even them.
As new councillors from both the opposition and ruling party were eager to start working for their areas, more experienced councillors at the workshop pointed out that results could only be shown if they were in power.
For Kalawana Pradeshiya Sabha UNP member Vayanthi Muhandiram, politics is not new. For years she had campaigned on behalf of her brother, but this was the first time that she herself had contested in an election. When we came to the council, we noticed that the previous chairman had not done anything for the people with the money that was allocated to the council. We started asking him questions and exposing corruption. In the opposition, you may not be able to build things, but you can highlight corruption, she said.
She further advised her fellow councillors to be creative in finding funds for the projects they wanted to undertake. There are various government programmes already in existence and government agencies that are responsible for different matters. Learn about them and direct those who come to you to them.
Having heard repeated complaints of inadequate funding, Dr. Fernando inquired as to whether the councillors were aware of the various taxes the councils collected and what happened to that revenue. A councillor from the Harispattuwa Pradeshiya Sabha answered that the revenue went to the chairman of the council and it was he who decided on the allocations, thereafter.
Training not over
As the councillors looked for solutions from their peers and trainers, Sivachandran noted that it was time to look into ways in which the women could work within the council. We need to focus on soft skills. How do we work with others in the council and prepare legislation that will change things
She also asked that the members not wait for assistance to come to them, but proactively look for ways in which they could build potential. There are agencies like the Industrial Development Board and agriculture offices which could be useful to you. You have to become people who provide jobs, those who create opportunity. Develop your potential, she encouraged.
When later questioned if their training covered council legislature and procedures as this was one of the knowledge gaps highlighted by the councillors, Sivachandran explained that they had indeed educated all women candidates on the legal matters discussed. We have given them all information about the Constitution and laws, but they more often than not, dont read.
In reality, the majority of women had only an O/L qualification, though very popular in their electorates. This ensured that they got elected, but the running of government has proven to be more difficult. The men from similar backgrounds, however, have found a way out by simply not taking part in legislative matters or by getting others to draft legislature for them. Local councils in general have, over the years, adopted very few changes to the manner in which they operate and whilst training programmes for councillors have been plenty, very few have executed radical change on the ground.
You cant blame them. Very few educated men or women come into politics, said Sivachandran.
Tisreena Mohamed Ismalebbe, the National Front for Good Governance (NFGG) member for the Akkaraipattu Municipal Council, has a Masters degree in Science. Her husband is the General Secretary of the party and she herself has been involved in party politics for some time.
People are not very aware of the laws and their rights. We need to undertake more research and awareness programmes on what they need, she said. According to Ismalebbe, her electorate mostly had people who were either self-employed or working in the public sector, and she would like to formulate new programmes with the consultation of the public, but first the public needed to know how the system worked.
Everywhere else, however, despite the limitation in knowledge, the councillors seem to know that the people required basic facilities and that is where they could perform with the right will. UPFA member Daya Dallallage of the Weeraketiya Pradeshiya Sabha, noted that their main concern was building a culvert in their area to stop flooding in their village. The councillor from the Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha stated that her main concern was to get more public toilets built in the area. Women and the old, especially, need public toilets, but the council says it is not a priority, she said.
The best example of the right will and determination, however, came from Yatinuwara Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) member, Pushpa. She is not only the only SLMC member in the council, but also the only Sinhalese Buddhist member to run from the SLMC in the area. Yet, she won not just once, but twice, in her electorate. I have faced many attacks from both sides for running under the SLMC. But I have persevered. We have to fight for things. Women do not get things handed to them, she said.
Over the years, she has worked in community projects to win local support. When I first entered the council, I could not even speak up, but today I can speak on any platform, she added, as she explained that the issues highlighted were not insurmountable, but simply needed experience.
The pilot project into the 25 percent quota system, at the end of the day, has definitely helped many women push their way into a male-dominated sphere of politics. Only time will tell whether women will change the system for the better. As discussions over the inclusion of the 25 percent quota system for women into the provincial council system are underway, Dr. Fernando noted that it would be very difficult to replicate the same in the provincial councils.
While we got many women in, the system has had several problems as a result of the large numbers of members appointed to the councils. Now we have so many members with very little work to do. I dont think this would work in the provincial councils.
At the Local Government Elections, council members were increased to 8,356 members from 4,500 to accommodate an extra 25 percent of women, instead of including them in the existing 4,500. For many years, we have been fighting for the quota and the only way the male politicians would agree, was to add the extra 25 percent. Otherwise, they saw it as women replacing men, said Dr. Fernando.
The above reasons, together with the pushback against the new mixed system from the two main parties, will likely result in only the local government system having the 25 percent quota for women. This means that it is these pioneering women who would now have to work twice as hard to ensure that their influence does not just remain local.
