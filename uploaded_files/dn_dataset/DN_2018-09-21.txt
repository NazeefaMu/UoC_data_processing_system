Jumbos killed by fuel train:
Committee appointed to prevent future mishaps
On the heels of the recent death of three elephants in an accident involving a fuel train, on the Batticaloa railroad, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva has decided to take immediate action to prevent such tragedies in future.
He has taken this decision considering the constant movement of elephants across railroads, the danger caused to them, and the losses incurred by such accidents to the Railway Department.
At a special discussion held at the Ministry regarding the matter, Minister de Silva appointed a committee headed by Transport Secretary G.S. Withanage to recommend measures to overcome this problem.
The other members of the committee are Railways General Manager M.J. Dilantha Fernando, Additional Secretary (Technical) Wildlife Ministry Veterinary Surgeon Dr G.A.T. Prasad, Elephant Conservation Director R.A. Sumanasena, Wildlife Protection Society Director Dr. Hemantha Perera and Irosh Perera, a student of Kingston University.
Following the appointment of the committee, several steps to prevent elephant mishaps were also discussed.
The committee paid special attention to the erection of electronic circuits at elephant corridors along the railroads and sections of the railroad frequented by elephants.
The possibility of erecting tunnels under the rail track for elephant crossings as well as building railway flyovers at spots frequented by elephants was also discussed at length. At this discussion, Irosh Perera explained to the Minister the successful results shown by the electronic circuit pilot project implemented at Settikulam on the Mannar railroad.
He said these circuits help to alert train drivers as well as the central operations room about the presence of elephants along a particular section of the railroad. The signals emanating from the circuits also helped to drive away elephants from the area.
Minister de Silva said the elephant population was affected by the large number of elephant deaths caused by train accidents. It was their duty to prevent this crime and lend their assistance towards the conservation of wildlife. The Minister requested the committee to study this problem and recommend urgent steps towards solving it.
He said he would obtain the funds necessary for the project by submitting a Cabinet paper on the matter.

DMK, Congress should be declared war criminals: AIADMK
CHENNAI: The ruling AIADMK Wednesday said former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa has revealed information about Indias help to his countrys army during UPA rule and demanded that an international war crimes probe be launched against those concerned in India.
A meeting of the AIADMK district secretaries meeting, held here under party presidium chairman E Madhusudhanan and in the presence of its top leaders--chief minister K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, adopted a resolution in support of the demand.
Referring to Rajapaksas reported remarks recently, the party said he had revealed information of Indian assistance to the Sri Lankan Army when the DMK-Congress alliance was ruling.
It said former chief minister and former party supremo late J Jayalalithaa had in 2010 demanded that the DMK, its late chief M.Karunanidhi and Congress should be declared war criminals for being instrumental in the killing of innocent Tamils in the island nation.
Now that Rajapaksa has openly admitted to all secrets in this regard, the DMK-Congress coalition governments aiding the killing of Tamils, these should be treated as war crimes and those involved (here) should be made war criminals and given punishment, the meeting resolved.
Congress and DMK have faced criticism for Indias reported assistance to Sri Lanka in its fight against the LTTE that witnessed heavy civilian Tamil casualties in 2009. - PTI

Entrust misappropriated Rs. 1.2 bn in public funds - Presidents Counsel
Presidents Counsel Upul Jayasuriya speaking at a public forum of the National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) made damning revelations that Entrust Securities PLC previously known as Ceylinco Shriram had misappropriated public funds amounting to Rs. 12 billion since 2013.
There have been audit reports and an investigation by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) which stated that the company had unsound
practices and severe financial irregularties, he said. It is our request to this government and the President to whom the NMSJ had sent a written letter, that a Presidential commission be set up to investigate the colossal loss of public funds.
PC Jayasuriya noted that this racket had been going on since 2013 and the management of the company had plundered deposits and investments made by the general public to the tune of Rs. 4500 million. A sum of Rs. 2063 million belonging to the Central Bank and Rs. 2500 million invested by the Ceylon Electricity Board had gone missing, he said.
Does this not warrant an investigation, particularly since the management of the Central Bank was aware of misdealings of this company which was also a primary dealer (PD) appointed by CB to deal in government securities such as Treasury Bills.
He further said that based on documents related to the financial mismanagement, the company Entrust Securities had gone on to donate a sum of Rs. 100 million to the Carlton Rugby Club and Rs. 500 million more as loans to various entities and individuals. The owners of the company had misappropriated nearly Rs. 4 billion through other companies which were under their purview. Investigations should be extended to include individuals who had profited from the company and to ascertain if these monies are in Sri Lanka or some offshore account.
The Presidents Counsel added that there ought to be a forensic audit on the dealings of the company. However he went to state that the Central Bank had refused to pay the quotation given by the reputed audit firm KPMG to conduct the audit. Jayasuriya praised the efforts by officers of the Auditor Generals department, including state counsel Sudarshana Silva and Senior DIG Ravi Waidyalankara, for carrying out investigations despite threats posed to their lives.
There are many people in this chain that need to be held responsible and accountable, he said. The systems within the Central Bank need to be urgently looked into. I cannot fathom why a private company is a primary dealer and was allowed to trade, misappropriating millions in CB funds.

Galle Fort, town lands sold for cheap rates - JVP
Regardless of the fact that the council seriously ailing from severe dearth of proper lands even to construct a vehicle park Galle Municipal Council is selling valuable lands in the town and Galle Fort at low  priced rates to the public sector through sneaky transactions, Southern Provincial Councilor (JVP) Nalin Hewage charged.
He made the above allegations at Galle District Co-ordinating Committee meeting held at the Galle District Secretariat. Southern Province chief minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva and Galle district parliamentarian Wijepala Hettiarachchi co-presided.
Hewage made the above allegation at the discussion held over the incident of exhumation of several ancient graves on a site which has been recommended to be sold to the private sector.
Galle Municipal Council and its incumbent councillors are provisional custodians of the lands in the municipality. Having been elected to power for five years they lease out council lands to the private sector for thirty years. People do not bring their vehicles to Galle town as there are no places for parking. It is hardly possible to find a piece of land even to construct even a toilet within town limits.The council cannot at least find a suitable land to provide parking to the thousands of people who come to the city daily, he said.
The recent land transactions of Galle Municipal Council were obviously made under sneaky transactions.
The Galle Mayor said that after thirty years, the land and all buildings at Peddler Street in Galle Fort will be owned by the council."We have made the lease agreement with such provisions. All such dealings were carried out after Cabinet approval.
We wanted to make use of a land which had been abandoned for long. As the excavations were carried out some graves were unearthed. However any development on the land will be allowed solely on the approval of the Archaeology Department.

Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara had directed the Secretary to the Ministry of Law and Order to conduct a Ministerial Level Inquiry into the conduct of IGP Pujith Jayasundara and submit a report within two weeks, Deputy Law and Order Minister Nalin Bandara told Parliament yesterday.
Responding to a question raised by Kegalle District UPFA MP Kanaka Herath on whether the President and Prime Minister had asked the IGP to resign within two weeks, Minister Nalin Bandara said there was no such request made.
Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara and I inquired about such a situation after we saw media reports to that effect, but there was nothing like that. This request appears to have been made by the media. However, the Police Commission or the Law and Order Minister has not been notified of such a request, Minister Bandara said.
Moneragala District MP Padma Udayashantha Gunasekera said that there were media reports to the effect that the President had told the IGP over the phone to resign.
No such official request was made for the resignation of the IGP either by the President or by the Prime Minister.
We dont listen to the telephone conversations, but as far as we are concerned, our ministry has not been notified of any such move, Deputy Minister Bandara said.
Meanwhile, JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake noted that the conduct of the IGP is not at all becoming of his position or rank. He asked the Deputy Law and Order Minister what his view was regarding the behaviour of the IGP, irrespective of what the orders may be.
Do you believe that an IGP who behaves in such a manner can establish proper law and order in the country he asked.
In response, Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said the IGP was appointed by the Constitutional Council. If there is an issue with his behaviour, then there is a proper manner in which action should be taken.
We are currently conducting an inquiry at ministerial level regarding certain complaints received against the IGP under the instructions of the Minister of Law and Order, he assured.
[PMs Office refutes reports ]
The Prime Ministers Office yesterday refuted media reports which stated that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has asked Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundera to resign, a press statement issued by Government Information Director-General Sudharshana Gunawardhana said.

Rajapaksa debt trap, major cause for Rupee fall - Mangala
The government could have considered using the USD foreign reserves to defend the rupee, if not for the humongous Rajapaksa debt trap, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
He told Parliament that the government had to pay USD 4.5 BN in 2019 and 2020, and 80% of this has been taken under the Rajapaksa regime.
An approach advocated by some of the MPs in the Opposition suggest that the Central Bank should defend the currency and prevent the currency depreciation by going against market forces. The only way to defend the currency is for the CBSL to sell its hard earned US Dollar reserves and buy rupees from the market to artificially prop up the value of the rupee, Minister Samaraweera said.
This might have been possible if we did not have to pay USD 4.5 billion debt repayments in 2019 and a similar amount further in 2020. Over 80% of these debts have been taken by the Rajapaksa regime.We are now properly managing and repaying their debts.We will then be able to secure this country from Rajapaksas debt trap.If we sell our foreign reserves we will be taking the same road taken by Turkey and Argentina which we cannot afford,Samaraweera said.
The Minister also pointed out that Sri Lanka has taken all appropriate policy measures to provide macro-economic stability to ensure the support for the capital accounts and the balance of payments and measures to control excessive import growth in the current account of the balance of payment.
It is imperative that we build the safe guards and resilience to be able to meet such volatility and further consolidate the macroeconomic facility.The government has taken appropriate steps to build our safeguards. Throughout 2017, the CBSL made a conscious effort to build foreign exchange reserves purchased from the market instead of the old practice of borrowing from reserves. Accordingly, reserves reached a record of USD 8.6 bn by the end of August 2018. The government has also achieved a primary surplus in the Budget 2017, the minister said.
Minister Samaraweera said that between January 1, 2018 and the September 18, 2018, the SL rupee has depreciated by 7.4%. During the same period, the Indian rupee has depreciated by 13.5 %. The Pakistan Rupee by 12.1 %. Indonesian Rupiah by 9.5%. Even the strong Russian economy, the Rouble has depreciated by 18.2% and 24.8% in Brazil. Turkey and Argentina are facing a genuine crisis due to depreciation.The Sri Lankan Rupee has depreciated by a 7.4%. But in the next three weeks, it will depreciate more, he said.
The Minister pointed out that Sri Lanka is not the only country subjected to the phenomenon of capital moving out of emerging and frontier market economies. If we are to remain integrated with the global economies and sell our exports and engaged in capital markets we will have to be exposed to such volatility he added.
Speaking further, the Minister pointed out the currency depreciation does not necessarily mean that a country cannot attain economic growth. Vietnams Rupiah is still depreciating at a much faster higher rate that Sri Lanka. According to these economic pundits Indonesia should also be a basket case. But as we know in 2017 Indonesian GDP reached USD 01 trillion and real GDP growth was over 5 percent. he pointed out. The Finance Minister said the primary determinants of the demand for currency are export and import of goods and services and net capital flows. In SL case, these basic indicators remain positive and we are moving in the right direction, he said.
Import growth was seen primarily in small size motor vehicles which were underpriced in the local market. In the first six months of 2018, imports increased by USD 1300 MN of which 70 per cent was contributed by the increase on imports of fuel and personal vehicles. The government promptly took measures to address both sources of import growth that were putting pressure on the currency. Previously, a minimum tax was imposed on motor vehicles up to 1000cc engine capacity. A market determined fuel price was introduced which curbed the excess demand for imported fuel. It is clear that timely preventive measures deter measures were taken by the government and thus far these measures have been successful in curbing excess import growth, he said.
The Minister said the normalization of US monetary policy has been a major factor affecting global financial markets.
After the finance crisis in 2008, the US interest rate dropped to record lows and investor capitals left the US and advanced economies in search of higher returns. As the US economy recovers, the federal reserves has been increasing the interest rates which has caused global investors to uplift capital from emerging markets like SL and return capital to the US. Naturally this has moved capital movement out of many emerging economies putting pressure on their balance of payment and causing currency depreciation. Sri Lanka too has experienced foreign investment in government securities moving out and foreign capital leaving the equity markets. Similar trends have been seen among all emerging and frontier market economies, the Minister said.

Siriliya Saviya Foundation vehicle used in abduction - CID tells Court
The CID conducting investigations into the murder of former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen yesterday informed Court that there is reliable information to support the fact that a Defender vehicle given to the Siriliya Saviya Foundation had been used to abduct Wasim Thajudeen.
Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) Dilan Ratnayake appearing on behalf of the CID made this revelation, when the magisterial inquiry into the murder of former Havelocks Rugby captain was taken up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Isuru Neththikumara.
Filing a further report in Court, DSG Ratnayake told Court that the CID has commenced an investigation regarding three vehicles while left from the Office of the Presidential Secretariat and Temple Trees on the night Thajudeens murder took place. On a previous occasion, the CID had filed a B report before the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court regarding a Defender vehicle bearing number plate WP KA-0642 found in Homagama belonging to the Siriliya Saviya Foundation. The investigations have revealed that the original colour of the vehicle have been altered on two occasions.
DSG Ratnayake further stated that the CID has sought an analytical report pertaining to Thajudeens mobile phone and laptop as a part of the investigation into the murder and they were yet to receive it. Further magisterial inquiry was fixed for November 29.
Former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake, former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera and former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof.Ananda Samarasekara had been named as first, second and third suspects of this case respectively. They were arrested over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder and conspiring to commit the murder. They are currently out on bail.
While delivering the verdict, former Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris on February 25, 2016 ruled that the death appeared to be a murder and ordered the CID Director to immediately arrest all suspects involved in the incident and produce them before Courts.
Thajudeen was killed, apparently, in a road accident in Colombo on May 17, 2012.
The CID had informed court that investigations conducted so far had revealed that Thajudeens teeth had been broken, the bones in the pelvic region also broken and his neck pierced with a sharp instrument prior to his death.
The CID added that the muscles in his legs had been cut with a piece of a broken class. Earlier, Police maintained that Thajudeen was driving to the airport and had lost control of his car and crashed into the wall of Shalika Grounds at Park Road, Narahenpita, and that his vehicle had exploded within seconds of the crash.

Presidential Commission probing SriLankan Airlines
Two companies paid for similar services in 2012
The Presidential Commission Probing the malpractices in SriLankan Airlines yesterday inquired the issues relating to a company selected to handle web services of the Airline. It was revealed that two companies had been paid money for six months in 2012 for similar services as the company had entered into a similar agreement with the second company while the agreement with the first company was in force. Sri Lankan Airlines former Head of e-Commerce, Ajith Weerasekara testified before the commission yesterday. Sri Lankan Airlines outsourcing the Web Development and Maintenance Activities of its websites had entered into an agreement with a company named E-Futures Pvt. Ltd. in June 2010. The agreement was signed for a period of three years till June 2013. Although, these activities were handled by a third party, the e-commerce activities including web marketing and managing were handled in-house during this period. However, the senior management of in November 2011, decided to terminate the agreement with the E-Futures by July 2012, as they had planned to enter into an agreement with another Company named H-Group. Accordingly, the airlines in January 2012 issued notice to the E- Futures, which is six months prior to the termination of the agreement. However they had made relevant payments to E-Futures during this period. While the agreement with the E-Futures was in place and there were six months for the agreement with them to be terminated, the SriLankan entered into another agreement with the H-Group Pvt. Ltd. in January 2012 for the same services and also for the handling of e-commerce activities including the Internet Booking Engine (IBE) system. It was revealed that this agreement had been signed without following the due procurement process. The witness told the commission that there was not even a review form for this contract. Weerasekera said that he didnt know the reasons for this agreement to be signed in a hurry with H-Group, but, a Board Paper in 2011 November indicated that the Board of Directors of Sri Lankan Airlines had made an observation that the web revenue contribution from IBE should have been increased. It had been their expectation to increase the share of the IBE from the Total Passenger Revenue to go over 10 per cent. The SLA- H Group agreement came to an end in June 2015 and the share of the IBE had not achieved the expected the target except several months from 2012 to 2016. It was also revealed that, although web developing and maintenance are carried out by a third party, it is very unusual that an airline is outsourcing its web services as many confidential details of passengers are also stored there. According to the witness, web services could have been maintained in-house without outsourcing if there is an additional staff with proper training. He said Sri Lankan Airlines could do that after taking back the handling of web services from the H-Group.

UNP has not politicised the Police - Hector
The UNP has not politicised the Police or meddled in its administrative affairs while working in the Unity Government, UNP backbench MP Hector Appuhamy said.
The MP was responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday. He pointed out that no Police officer was transferred or unduly interfered with due to political reasons during the last three years.
Such transfers and interferences were rampant under the previous Government. Some of the Joint Opposition politicians are still engaged in extortion, he alleged.This is when they do not have the ruling power. What would be the plight if they held power he remarked.
With reference to the IGP, the MP said a decision must soon be taken on the allegations regarding his conduct and certain statements. He also demanded to expedite the investigations on the alleged plot to assassinate the President and the former Defence Secretary.
We see a huge conspiracy here. It is not clear whether it is to ruin or protect the country or to grab power or whether it (Opposition) is acting as a cats paw of a foreign country. The truth must come out, he noted.
MP Appuhamy said the UNP backbench group is getting ready for a fresh fight in the coming days to project its true achievements to the people.
We waited patiently and contained our activity keeping in mind that we work within a Unity Government. However, the SLFP Group of 16 attacked the UNP throughout this period and now their allegiances are clear. We are not ready to restrict ourselves anymore, we will start a revolt, he added.
When asked about the Ruwan Wijewardene Committee Report on UNP Party reforms, MP Kavinda Jayewardena said its recommendations are now in the implementation stage.
He said the Politbureau Committee headed by the Prime Minister would come up with a timeframe to implement its recommendations, adding that the responsibility of party reforms are now with that Committee. Asked by journalists as to whether they are frustrated that the party reforms were not made, MPs Jayewardena and Appuhamy replied in the negative.

Upgrade for Kandyan Dancing as a profession
Scince, Technology, Research, Skills Development, Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama announced that his ministry has initiated a programme to upgrade the professional standing of the exponents of the traditional Kandyan Dance.
The minister made this announcement while presiding over a function to affiliate the Nipunatha Arts Training Centre at Thiththapajjala to the Vocational Training Authority functioning under his ministry.
The minister said that all expenses of maintaining Kandyan Dance training centres that qualify for registration with the Vocational Training Authority will be met by his ministry. He said that his intention is also to give a measure of support through this initiative to the traditional schools of dancing in the Kandyan areas that have so far preserved this dance form amid many difficulties.
The minister recalled his close association with the famous exponent of Kandyan Dance, the Late Thiththapajjala Suramba Gurnnanse. The Minister paid him high tribute as a world-class artiste. He reminisced that the famous Niththawela Gunaya Gurunnanse came to Trinity College in his school days to teach dancing to the students.
He said that such famous dancers of yesteryear used to perform at prestigious theatres the world over to the acclaim of art lovers and thereby brought honour to the country. Minister Dr. Amunugama said that that the professionalisation of the art of Kandyan dancing will not only bring a steady income to talented young men and women practising it, but will also give a boost to the tourist industry because just as much as the beaches, the wildlife and the archeological ruins, Sri Lankas Kandyan Dance is also world famous and therefore would be a big tourist attraction.
Dr. Amunugama said that scholars of other countries have researched on the Kandyan dance and have written books on the subject and that places like the University of Virginia have on display much material relating to the Kandyan Dance. It is embarrassing that we do not have such a place in Sri Lanka, said the Minister. He declared that his intention is to make Thiththapajjala such a centre which could attract from the world over, scholars and art lovers interested in the Kandyan Dance.

Five-year grant programme:
USs MCC officials meet PM
A delegation from the US Governments Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), led by Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Nash, visited Sri Lanka this week to continue progress on the proposed MCC compact  a large-scale five-year grant programme. MCC is developing the compact in partnership with the Sri Lankan govvernment to promote inclusive economic growth that will benefit Sri Lankans.
During the visit, COO Nash met with senior government officials, including Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, State Finance Minister Eran Wickramaratne and Foreign Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam.
The proposed MCC Sri Lanka Compact is in the final stage of development. The compact is expected to be negotiated with the Sri Lankan government in the coming weeks. MCC will fund the compact entirely through grants which do not need to be repaid rather than loans.
The proposed MCC compact reflects our commitment to development projects that make economic sense and drive growth in a way that increases local jobs, said Charg daffaires ad interim Robert Hilton. With this compact, we have an opportunity to promote transparent decisions about Sri Lankas long-term interests in terms of costs, benefits, and sustainable development.
We are pleased that progress continues on the proposed MCC compact, said MCC COO Nash. Developed in partnership with the Sri Lankan government, the proposed MCC Sri Lanka Compact is designed to spur economic growth and investment by the private sector to reduce poverty and increase economic opportunities for the people of Sri Lanka.
Based on an analysis of Sri Lankas economy and the constraints that are holding back private investment and growth, MCC expects to invest in projects proposed by the Sri Lankan government in the transport and land sectors.
The proposed compact would improve road networks and the bus system in the Colombo Metropolitan Region, and improve road connectivity between the central region and ports and markets in the Western Province. The compact would upgrade more than 300 kilometres of urban and interprovincial roads. In addition, the compact would improve land administration, and strengthen land rights and tenure security.
MCC is an innovative foreign assistance agency of the United States Government established in 2004 that has signed compacts with 29 countries around the world. In December 2016, MCCs Board of Directors selected Sri Lanka to develop a compact.

The Education Ministry will conduct a career guidance programme with the aim of creating awareness of the value of tertiary education, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
A five-day career guidance fair and exhibition will be held at Kuliyapitiya Central College from October 3 to October 7, from 9 am to 10 pm each day.
The Minister said that this is the first-ever career guidance programme conducted by the Education Ministry, as the need for increasing human capital of the country has been identified.
A large number of students are in a dilemma about what to do, especially after their Advanced Levels or after dropping out of school. Even school dropouts dont have a clear idea about what to do once they finish their general education, the Minister said.
Lack of knowledge and the scarcity of proper career guidance programmes are the main causes for this situation, he said.
The Education Ministry will hold the proposed career guidance programme countrywide in due course.
The next exhibitions will be held in Kandy, Galle and Matara. Both government and private sector institutions will take part. Students who obtained patents for their innovations will also be given opportunity to display their creations at the fairs.
A career guidance booklet is being prepared for the exhibitions, the Minister said.
The fairs will include book exhibitions, entrepreneurial guidance workshops, job fairs, and entertainment programmes.

The Ceylon Teachers Union said it condemned the attempt made by the Education Ministry to offer official recognition to private education by getting representatives of private universities to attend principals meetings organised through Zonal Education Offices.
Principals meetings convened by the Ministry and schools themselves facilitate curriculum development in private universities.
The Ceylon Teachers Union in a press release, stated that offering of state resources for the development of private schools and private universities in this manner by a government which came to power on a pledge to enhance free education was a grave national crime.
Moreover, the Education Ministry recently chose a private university in its vicinity as the venue to conduct a training workshop for sectional heads of national schools. The workshop held by the ministry under its own expenditure had helped to boost that private university.
The Education Ministry should immediately stop this action relating to the private sector by wasting its funds intended to develops education in government schools.
The union highlighted this danger during a discussion between Education Unions, and the Education Minister and his officials on September 17.
