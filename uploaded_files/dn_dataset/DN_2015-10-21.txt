Agiant in the making!
Pictures byThushara Fernando
It was pure chance and fate that brought him into active politics. He has not looked back since he took the plunge.
Mayantha Yaswanth Dissanayake, born on January 11, 1974 in Colombo, has sufficient credentials. He was the younger son of Srimathi Dissanayake and the late Gamini Dissanayake. He is currently an MP from the Kandy District and the Chief Organizer for Yatinuwara electorate representing the United National Party.
Mayantha describes himself as a fair and reasonable person with a kind heart. He observes sometimes telling the truth too much and seeing things in black and white have put him in difficulty. More than anything, he seeks truthfulness, honesty, integrity and loyalty from others.
This young gentleman takes late president John F Kennedys words Ask not what your country can do for you, but ask what you can do for your country, as a guideline and says it is his favourite dictum.
Role model
Dissanayake reveals his childhood dream was to be like late President J R Jayewardene.
He was my hero and idol. I was at a very young age then and I did not comprehend that he was the President of the country. However, when we met him he treated us like grandchildren. He was very warm. We were very close to him because of my father, he narrates.
Even though he likes when people call him like father like son, he recalls that it is his mothers influence which made him who he is today. No doubt, my father has left a great image and legacy, but it is my mother and brother who played a huge role in my life when I was growing up. My father was a full time politician in charge of the accelerated Mahaweli Project, one of the largest development projects in the history of this country. Therefore, we did not get much time to interact with him as a father and sometimes we hardly saw him, he ponders his past.
He recollects with a sense of gratitude how his mother and brother Navin, who is currently an MP for the Nuwara Eliya district, stood by him since his fathers untimely death.
That few seconds, when I heard my father was assassinated for no other reason than his political belief, was the most shocking, horrific and nightmare experience in my life. I dont think I would ever recover from it. I was about 19 years old then, he reminisces with pain.
Following fathers footsteps
Dissanayake says he tries to follow his fathers footsteps to contribute to the development of the country and serve its people, but maintains that the comparison is not fair because he and his brother have not yet been given the opportunities his father had.
However, he reasons that there is a saying that the apple does not fall far from the tree meaning that one day an apple can become a huge tree like its parent tree. That is what we want to do. We want to see the UNP government excels and delivers to the people. We would like to see a Mahaweli age back in this country, he says with resolution.
Dissanyake holds a Degree in Printing Management in Rochester Institute of Technology in New York and has also followed a Higher National Diploma in Printing Technology from the London College of Printing.
I studied at Royal College in Colombo and St Thomas Prep. In the era from 1987-89, there were insurgencies in the country and bombs were exploding all over. There were a lot of political assassinations. It was in that context, my parents decided to send me to a boarding school in the UK. I remember the first time that I went to England. I was the only Asian boy in my dormitory in the boarding school. I was thinking why my parents took such a harsh decision and bring me to this strange land. My English was not so good. My knowledge of history, geography and French was not up to the level of other kids. I had to struggle hard to come up to their standards, he recalls.
Hobbies
Dissanayake is an energetic youth who loves swimming and diving very much. I really enjoy diving. I am now doing my technical diving. He has also played little cricket at school. Cricket is my favourite game, but I like Rugby and football as well. Currently, I am the Vice President of the Baseball Federation in Sri Lanka and I am beginning to like the game of baseball. Whenever I have time I go and watch international ODI cricket matches or rugby matches.
Being a dynamic young leader, Dissanayake has also got the opportunity to be selected through the US Embassy to an international leadership programme conducted by the US State Department last year. He has been familiar with the American system of governance during the programme.
That was a memorable learning experience that I will remember for the rest of my life, he says with excitement.
Spending time with family
Politicians of our time have little time of their own and it is not an exception for Dissanayake. He likes to spend his precious time off with his family. Among the books he has read, George Orwells Animal Farm was a novel that was sticking in his mind when he was growing up. He likes the songs of Sunil Shantha, and when it comes to English he enjoys Frank Sinatras music a lot. He describes the film Truman based on the American president Harry Truman as the most interesting film that he has watched. He loves to spend his holiday anywhere in the hill country, as he likes the cooler climate and hills.
He also identifies himself as a very shy and private person. People think when they see and talk to me that I am not, because when I am on stage and make a political speech it is a different personality that they see he discloses. He also expresses that he is excellent in keeping secrets. However, if I hear something interesting, but not damaging to somebody I would share it with my wife, he explains fervently.
Love at first sight No
He says he does not believe in love at first sight. I met my soul mate through my mother. My mother knew the parents of her family very well. It was a kind of proposal. I got married in 2004, he replies.
Commenting on his religious views he tags himself as a good Buddhist and believer in the Hindu Gods, adding that he goes to both temple and kovil. I want people to be somewhat religious and believe in something because that will give you focus and purpose. I am an eggetarian and drink milk [ovo-lacto vegetarian]. But I dont eat meat and fish, not even Maldive fish, he adds.
He thinks the influence of the great leaders and statesmen that he had the opportunity to associate with helped him develop his leadership qualities. For example, I see Ranil Wickremesinghe as a great leader that I can really learn from. He is a very patient leader. It is he who invited me to be in politics. As for me, I tell people what I can do for them and what I want to do for them. I generally tell the truth. It feels very good to know that you are being loved by the people, but it also humbles you because when people love and care for you it is an encouragement to do more for them. If I can help in any way to make peoples lives better, I will contribute towards that, he explains.
He maintains that the traditional politics in Sri Lanka has to change. He is of the view that youngsters and people with ability should be given a more prominent role. However he adds that the Government is on the right track, while expressing that Sri Lanka is in need of a new Constitution, a new electoral system, bill of rights as well as the Right to Information Act.

Await stylish steps!
For the first time in Sri Lanka, the Lionel Wendt Art Center will be graced by 14 award-winning dance troupes hailing from all over the island and the world. Kapila Palihawadana, the globe-trotting founder of Sri Lankas first contemporary dance company Natanda Dance Theater of Sri Lanka, called the upcoming gala an exploration of cultural identities, ethnic reconciliation and peace building. The five-day dance festival is not just about dance, he affirmed, it will be about bringing people together.
Besides the Natanda Dance Theater, the other local talent at the fest include Jaffnas Jonson Rajkumar, Ratnapuras Sithija Performing and Dance Academy, Batticoloas Batticaloa Theater Lab, Kandys Natanda Community Dance and Colombos drumming maestros NAADRO. Ali Chahrour of Lebanon, The Aviary Birdgang Dance Company of UK, Lawrence Sackris of Malaysia, Oliver Tharpaga of the USA, Goblin Party of South Korea, and Sanjib Bhattacharya of India make up the international ingredients of this grand event, and were all handpicked very carefully, said Kapila Palihawadana, based on the merit that their dancing has done for the community. Some examples include USAs Olivier Tharpaga, originally from Burkina Faso, who organizes dance fests himself and volunteered to take part in this Sri Lankan edition free of cost, or Birdgang of the UK who uses dance to elevate children living on the streets, or Sanjib of India who uplifts the elderly with dance.
Although it has been called a contemporary dance festival, there will still be that unmistakable infusion of the tradition and culture of Asias diverse regions, whether it is in the Odissi steps of Indian origin, in the beat of African drums, or in the storytelling of ancient Kandyan dancing. Thujan Sivasupramanaiyan of the Batticoloa Theater Lab, spoke of how dancing in his troupe meant placing traditional dance as the base, and then building modern or contemporary dance upon it. Dance is explored as not just a form of art at the festival, but also a form of reconciliation in a post-war Sri Lanka. Thujan and his colleague Selvaraj Rajiv are tutored under Professor Maunaguru who is a great innovator of the traditional Koothu dance form, and they spoke of how dancing is a kind of release from sorrows and tensions. Kapila Palihawadana concurred that dancing together, regardless of race or nationality, engenders respect for one another. It is something you do with your body, he explained, and the body is an equalizer among all peoples. Dance somehow then seems to be an interesting tool for dialogue in an evolving Sri Lanka.
Sri Lankan dance has a vibrant and deep history - we have 2500 years of dance experience in Kandyan dance alone - and the timeline has reached an exciting peak today, as contemporary dance in Sri Lanka is only now truly emerging. Dance, and in the same vein, theater and poetry, are striving to become self-sufficient industries on their own, no longer cowed down by the corporate mantra that art and culture studies are not worthy of pursuing. Kapila Palihawadana, much like many other Asian artistes, had to work against his parents advice in pursuing his dream of succeeding as an artist; when asked about this popular Asian mentality about the arts as a career, he said that art is crucial to us in that only art can give people a sense of living and a sense of feeling, and only it can swallow up the mistrust and miscommunications that plague our communities.
Dance is a personal, raw means of expression, wherein the body speaks and is incapable of pretense - the Natfest celebration of dance means great things in terms of the creative growth of Sri Lankas art scene, and also in our attempt as a nation to discuss our various cultural identities and challenges in a new language. While the concerts will take place in the evenings between November 14 and 18 at the Lionel Wendt Art Center, the public also have the privilege of participating in three-hour workshops with the local and international dancers in the daytime, at Nelum Pokuna for only Rs. 500 per day. Tickets will be available at the Lionel Wendt) from November 1.

Be your own boss!
01) It's a lifestyle, not a job.
Architects typically tend to think about architecture all the time, I know I do. Not just the big A type of buildings or projects, but every little thing from every where I go. I go somewhere and start looking at materials, form, massing, lighting, etc. If I take a trip somewhere, I start by planning it around the buildings I want to visit. Probably 90% of all the books I buy (not including children's titles) are about architecture - I even put them on my Christmas list.
*****-----
02) People respect architects.
Even if they don't really understand what we do, there is a perception that architects are ethical and responsible and will endeavor to make the right decision to our own detriment. It's part of the reason that architect is chosen so often as the vocation for title characters in movie and TV roles. Architects aren't generally viewed as driven by financial rewards like doctors or as scurrilous as lawyers (can be).
*****-----
03) Job is constantly evolving.
Architects are not artists - we have to address building technology and programming. There are constantly evolving materials and construction methods out there and we are required as a profession to address the demands of the public at large (building performance, energy consumption, incorporating recycled materials, etc.). Architects create new design concepts that push how modern day construction is executed. Architecture is one of the few professions that is never static.
*****-----
04) Artistic freedom and personal expression.
As an architect, we are given certain project parameters that help guide the direction of our projects. We are then given the freedom to pursue the artistic embodiment of those parameters. 10 architects with the same client and the same project parameters will provide 10 different solutions. Every time.
*****-----
05) You can be your own boss.
You can be your own firm of one and still be a viable service provider on almost any size project. You can enter contests and win commissions for major projects by yourself - I can't think of another vocation that can provide similar latitudes. I have also seen a team of 3 people design and prepare construction documents on a mall over 1,000,000 square feet.
*****-----
06) There are tangible (and sometimes euphoric) results.
Anyone who has ever seen a building that they worked get built knows exactly what I am talking about. I am still excited to watch one of my projects getting built - it's like having your own laboratory where you can experiment and refine things that you consider to be important and worthwhile. It ties into the artistic freedom listed in #4 but architects generally have a sense of ownership on every project they work.
*****-----
07) We can positively impact peoples lives.
It is rewarding to develop a personal relationship with your client, particularly when you know that the process will yield a more fruitful end product. By understanding the process, our clients appreciate the product. By appreciating the product, they are acknowledging the role it plays.
*****-----
08) Experimentation is expected.
Despite architecture having to contain building sciences and technology, the final esoteric product does not have a definitively right or wrong answer. Because no two architects will ever come up with the exact same solution given an identical set of parameters, there is a liberating sense that you are here for the purpose of imparting your own personality on the project. We are expected to try new things, explore different materials, and incorporate emerging technologies into every project.
*****-----
29) Longevity of Career.
You can practice the profession of architecture for as long as you want - you'll always be an architect even when it isn't your job anymore. Most architects don't really start to become good until later in life - I'm talking in their 50's. I imagine that you have to come to some sort of understanding as to who you are as an individual before you can start to be consistent with imparting your imprint onto a building.
*****-----

10) Incredible variety of options within the profession.
Unlike other professions, you graduate with a degree in architecture without having to know what type of architecture you are going to focus on. This is really great because when you graduate, you don't know enough about the possibilities to know what you want to do. You can float between big and little firms, the role of project architect, designer, or management. You can work on building types from different market sectors like hospitality, residential, civic, retail, etc. and will still be an architect. Your degree will have a marketable value beyond the time of your immediate graduation.
Bonus. We can wear ridiculous eye wear and get away with it.
People expect architects to be a little bit nerd mixed with creative artist. This conflict of known social paradigms allows generous liberties to be taken with your personal billboard (but you have to earn it).

Better environment for education sector is govts aim - Grero
The governments aim is to make a better environment for education sector development since the development and progress of the education sector directly links with the overall development of the country including economic development, University Affairs State Minister Mohan Lal Grero said.
He made these comments after visiting the hostel construction site at the Moratuwa University on Tuesday.
The minister said the government focuses on finding a proper solution for hostel scarcity of undergraduates of every university.
"Steps have also been taken to improve the facilities of hostels aiming to create a better education environment," Grero said.
He said in line with the governments move to provide every undergraduate with hostel facilities, another set of over 1,000 undergraduates of the Moratuwa University will receive hostel facilities under the ongoing project which is scheduled to be completed early next year.
The state minister requested the authorities to hand over the two hostels nearing completion by next January.
The two hostels will provide hostel facilities for 600 female undergraduates.
He also advised to build a new hostel for 400 male undergraduates utilising government allocations.
He also observed the on-going building construction project at the university premises.
Considering the issue of land limitation for further expansion of the university, the Sate Minister advised the university administration to look into the availability of buying two plots of lands around the university premises.

Buddhist relics of Amaravati museum to be exhibited
Buddhist relics preserved at the Archaeological Museum in Amaravati, India and kept away from public eye will be exhibited, during the capital foundation ceremony.
A collection of exclusive artifacts from the museum, including bone relics of the Buddha will be on display at 'Amaravati Pavilion', proposed to be created by the Tourism Department at the venue. According to sources, the relics were originally found in the stupa at Bhattiprolu in Guntur district. They were donated by the Mahabodhi Society of India and the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.
"Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi and dignitaries from across the country and abroad will be here, Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu wants the relics to be showcased on this special occasion," said R. Amarendra Kumar, Executive Director (Projects) AP Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC).
The Amaravati museum is home to many relics dating back to thousands of years, found during excavations. This museum has a wealth of the ancient Amaravati town that belonged to 3rd century BC, through several sculptures that once were a part of Mahachaitya (the giant stupa).
The exhibition will showcase the past, present and the future of the ancient town and will be kept open for public for a month from October 22.
Replicas of sculptures and a miniature model of the future Amaravati capital city will adorn the pavilion besides an exclusive collection of ancient coins.
This region was ruled by dynasties such as the Satavahanas, Andhra Ikshvakus, Pallavas, Ananda Gotrikas, Vishnukundina, Kota Vamsa, Chalukyas, Cholas, Kakatiyas, Reddis and Vijayanagara kings during ancient and medieval times.
The Mumbai-based Hinduja Foundation will display coins of a few dynasties such as Pallavas, Vishnukundina and Vijayanagara kingdoms dating from 150 BC to 250 AD.
"We have an exclusive collection of about 70 coins of different dynasties, of which the Satavahana collection is the largest and the most comprehensive," says Brig (retd.) H. Chukerbuti, chief functionary of Hinduja Foundation.
"We also have a collection of punch marked coins believed to be the oldest coins in Indian history," said Mr. Chukerbuti.
Punch-marked coins are a type of early coinage of India, dating to between about the 6th and 2nd centuries BC. The foundation members are also calling an expert on Satavahana dynasty from New Delhi to answer the queries of visitors.
"Each coin has a unique motif. There are too many intricacies involved. Only an expert on the subject can explain them," says the former Brigadier, the Hindu reports. - The Hindu

China Is Still Building Ghost Cities
Plans for new urban areas would provide housing for 3.4 billion people  far more than Chinas total population
A new surge of urban development may create a new wave of ghost cities in China, as the country draws up plans to house as many as 3.4 billion people, far in excess of its current population.
Reports from both official news agency Xinhua and the independent media outlet Thepaper.cn say that urban planning in China is out of control, as each of the countrys provincial capitals is planning to build an average of 4.6 new urban districts, and regional cities look to build an average of 1.5 new districts.
These new urban areas would provide housing for 3.4 billion people  entirely out of line with actual demand from Chinas population of less than 1.4 billion.
According to Xinhua, a survey of 156 local-level and 161 county-level cities across 12 provinces found the 12 provincial capitals are planning a total of 55 new districts, with one alone planning 13. Over 90 percent of local-level cities are planning new districts, the agency said.
The problem of uncontrolled development is not new: in 2013 the Peoples Daily criticized the trend of building new cities with the expectation that they would eventually be filled, in particular, the development of smaller cities that do not have the same potential as larger economic centers. During normal urban development, large cities absorb smaller ones as they expand, but in many cases in China they have over-expanded, building entire new cities or districts which become under-occupied ghost cities.
The amount of land needed for expansions is also increasing. One provincial capital in the west of China is proposing three new districts and five new cities  requiring 7.8 times as much land as the original city covers. Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan in central China, covers an area of 132 square kilometers, and is planning a new district of 150 square kilometers.
According to Xinhua, the trend for development of new urban areas is spreading from provincial capitals to smaller local and county-level cities, with construction on county land and in development zones also heating up. A lack of coordination means that in some cases several new cities are being planned in an area of only some dozens of square kilometers.
Zhou Yixing, a Peking University professor and a consultant to the Urban Planning Society of China, told Thepaper.cn that while most resources and personnel are concentrated in the large cities, development has not been coordinated with smaller nearby cities, and so growth hasnt spread to those areas and spurred their own development. As growth in the large cities hasnt been well-managed, urban problems such as congestion are getting worse.
Dai Jifeng, deputy head of the China Academy of Urban Planning & Designs Urban Transport Institute, told chinadialogue that a survey of 288 local-level cities found 164 had built ring roads to help manage traffic flow.
Some cities didnt originally have such systems, but linked up several existing roads to form ring roads, he said, adding that demand for other forms of transport are often ignored.
In the past economic growth was seen as the most important part of urban development  so it had to be done quickly, and often at any cost, according to Shi Nan, deputy chair of the International Society of City and Regional Planners.
Speaking at the recent 2015 Annual National City Planning Conference, Shi said there is an urgent need for better urban-rural planning to resolve a number of urban development issues  and most importantly, the ideology of urban planning needs to change.
Shi said that during the 13th Five Year Plan, urban planning in China will need to change by taking the environment into account more, becoming more people-centred, and having government systems acknowledge social problems. Methods of construction as well as the intensity and scale of development could all see big adjustments in the new Plan, Shi added.
Li Tie, director of the National Development and Reform Commissions Center for Urban Development, told reporters that urban development should take place through natural growth of functional zones, rather than artificial planning. There should also be more rational placement of industry and a focus on sustainable development, Li said.
According to Peking Universitys Zhou, resolving the increasing disparity between regional and urban-rural income levels doesnt necessarily mean expanding big cities. Developing small and medium-sized cities, particularly at the county level where there are closer links with rural areas, may be the answer. For example, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Coordinated Development Plan would be improved if more efforts were spent outside Beijing and if functions were not permanently concentrated in the capital.

Dazzling Kate
Holy gorgeousness! Kate Middleton attended her first ever state banquet on Oct. 20 where she welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping in a flawless scarlet tulle gown and a lavish diamond tiara. See the stunning pics here!
Kate Middleton, 33, looked every bit the royal icon while attending her first state dinner at Buckingham Palace on October 20. As it was her debut at such a traditionally high-profile event, guests and fans alike were equally anxious to see what the Duchess of Cambridge would wear.
Naturally, she didn't disappoint! Kate stunned in a scarlet ball gown and plenty of gleaming diamonds - including a tiara! Click here to see the pics!
Kate joined her husband Prince William and Queen Elizabeth in hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan at the ornate white tie affair, which was held in their honor following a four-day state visit. Needless to say, the momentous occasion called for a particularly show-stopping ensemble, which Kate mastered (and then some) in a gorgeous scarlet red Jenny Packham tulle gown offset by a gorgeous diamond tiara! The Egyptian-style tiara, called the Lotus Flower tiara, is from the 1920s and was once owned and worn by the Queen's mother. The occasion was also just the third official time Kate has worn a tiara in public. In addition to her wedding day, the duchess was photographed with the papyrus tiara adorning her head at the annual diplomatic reception in 2013.
With its pearl and diamond details taking center stage, Kate wore the tiara with her hair pulled back into a low knot style and her new bangs parted to the side. To fit with her opulent look, Kate wore a more noticeably glamorous makeup look punctuated by defined brows and a subtly brown smokey eye.
Inside the banquet, Kate had the honor of sitting next to the Chinese president and Queen Elizabeth at the high table. Among the other nearly 170 guests were Prime Minister David Cameron, Chancellor George Osborne and Prince Harry also appeared to be attending the event in a black puffer jacket and unshaven face, Daily Mail reports.
The A-list attendees were seated at a horseshoe-shaped table inside the palace ballroom where they dined using the silver of King George the IV and napkins adorned by the Queen's monogram all while enjoying each other's company in the name of international diplomacy.
Meanwhile, it looks like Kate is back to business as usual after giving birth to her second child, Princess Charlotte, back in April. Her maternity leave ended in mid-September and much like after her first pregnancy, the Duchess is looking more radiant than ever.

From fascism to fashion: Fendi moves into Mussolini's former masterpiece
ITALY: It was built as the centrepiece of Mussolini's new Roman empire, a symbol of deluded grandeur that was abandoned during the Second World War and has lain empty ever since.
Now a striking Fascist building that Italians call "the Square Colosseum" has been given a new lease of life as the global headquarters of Fendi, the fashion company.
The firm has spent millions of dollars renovating the building, in the latest example of private corporations stepping in to save Italy's crumbling cultural heritage.
With its solid shape and symmetrical rows of arches, it imitates the form of the ancient Roman amphitheatre, but in a sleek, rationalist style.
Known officially as the Palazzo della Civilta Italiana, or the Palace of Italian Civilisation, it was built under "Il Duce" as the main focus of EUR, a new town on the outskirts of Rome conceived at the height of Fascist rule in the Thirties.
Designed as a permanent exhibition space, it was due to have been inaugurated in 1942 as part of a grandiose world fair intended to celebrate the achievements of 20 years of Fascism. But the Second World War put paid to all that.
Apart from a brief spell when one floor was used by a state labour institute, it has been empty ever since - a shining white monument perched on a hill, clearly visible to visitors as they drive into Rome from Leonardo da Vinci airport.
At the top of the building, a romantic vision of Italy is spelled out in giant letters: "A population of poets, of artists, of heroes, of saints, of thinkers, of scientists, of navigators and voyagers."
Around its base are 28 marble statues, allegories for sturdy Fascist virtues such as social order, labour, physics and military genius.
While the white travertine exterior was in good condition, and the Carrara marble stairways and floors were well preserved, the building had to be converted into offices for Fendi's 450 staff.
"It wasn't built as an office, and that was one of the biggest challenges for the architects and engineers," said Maria Sole Henny, Fendi's corporate affairs manager. "It was effectively a big white marble box. There was no plumbing and no electricity so we had to install all that."
For the first time in the building's history, the public will have access to the palazzo, as the ground floor will become a permanent exhibition space with free entrance. The inaugural exhibition, which opens on Friday, will examine the history of the building and the Fascist vision for EUR. There will be footage from Italian films in which the building has featured. The trend for fashion companies to be involved in restoration projects began with Tod's, the luxury goods maker, which in 2011 paid 22 million ($46 million) for the cleaning and restoration of the Colosseum. Diego Della Valle, the company's chairman, said he hoped that his example would encourage other wealthy businessmen to help rescue Italy's unrivalled cultural heritage. His appeal evidently struck a nerve.
In the past few years, some of the best-known names in Italian fashion have stepped forward to sponsor restoration projects, rather like powerful families during the Renaissance commissioned palaces, monuments and works of art as statements of their wealth.
In its first major foray into the area, Fendi paid for the restoration of the Trevi Fountain - the ornate monument in Rome in which Anita Ekberg famously cavorted for Fellini's La Dolce Vita, the 1960 black-and-white classic.
A few hundred yards away, work started this month on the Spanish Steps, where Gregory Peck once flirted with Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday, the 1953 romantic comedy. That clean-up is being paid for by Bulgari, the jewellers, which has its flagship store close by.
Meanwhile in Venice, the Diesel jeans company has footed the bill for the cleaning of the Rialto Bridge, which spans the Grand Canal.
With official data showing Italy's economy growing by just 0.2 per cent this year, the calls for public-private partnerships to save the country's cultural heritage are likely to grow.
The government has appealed for a private sponsor to stump up 25 million to preserve the Domus Aurea, a vast palace built by the Emperor Nero in Rome.
"This is an opportunity for a big company to sponsor an extraordinary project, which will capture the world's attention," said Dario Franceschini, the minister for cultural heritage.

Home sweet home
Talking to Murad Ismail makes one feel that a house is a living entity. Almost like an organism that one can love and have a connection with. Haunted houses have been the subject of many movies. However to visit a haunted house one will have to go to Hollywood and thankfully not Sri Lanka! At least we hope not! Arch World brings to you your constant companion - the house.
They say a house has to feel different in the morning, afternoon and evening. Like a human being with varying moods.
This can be done by manipulating the use of natural light and ventilation within the land. As you move throughout the spaces, at varying times of the day, the movement of the sun and changing quality of light lends each space a different feel. The play of shadows also enhances and changes the mood of the space, said Architect Murad Ismail.
What makes a house a home are the memories it carries. It is more than concrete. We understand the attachment that makes it a home. We feel about homes. Leaving your home to go and live somewhere else can be disconcerting. Because to us it was a living object and not something inanimate.
The house has to communicate with you. It needs to have synergy, which we try and achieve with natural light and ventilation. As the levels of light change throughout the day, it creates different moods and ambiences in the house. Most importantly the house is designed as a home, a space you belong in, to fit your specific purpose, so you don't lack anything.
Technology
We can only imagine what kind of houses our children or our descendants will live in. Technology is evolving at a rapid rate. Our ancestors never imagined the light bulb before Thomas Edison. They said only angels could fly before the Wright brothers. Who knows what is in store for us in the future
Technology has come a long way and there isn't much that can't be built. However grand your design, technology can help you achieve it. However, I believe the use of technology shouldn't be used for the sake of using it. Rather it should be used to enhance a design. The design should take precedence and not the other way. Design has evolved in two ways - 1. Using technology for the sake of it i.e. the design is done to enhance the technology used. 2. Using technology to enhance the design.
Ecological Designs, are to ensure that our actions and decisions today do not inhibit the opportunities of future generations. Similarly that can be said of a house. I think there is a misconception that if you use bio degradable materials then you have achieved an eco-friendly design. The materials typically used in these instances: sticks & stones, timber, thatched roofs - all have a natural lifespan. Eventually, they all need to be renewed and replenished. They cannot be sustained over a long period of time.
In my personal view, ecological design is one that uses a substance that uses X amount of energy which will provide you with the use of a material that will last a 100 years. These materials take minimum effort to be maintained and do not need to be regularly renewed and replenished. They are more sustainable. You need to also consider the energy consumption used to produce the materials. Natural light & ventilation is also important to maximize the natural resources.
Heat waves
Sri Lanka is a tropical country with frequent heat waves. Fortunately it isn't as bad as other countries where heat waves can actually kill. Nevertheless a house can be designed in such a way where this problem can be solved.
Traditionally we were taught to create an opening at one point of the room and another one directly across from it. But I don't believe this works, as it does not provide a way for hot air to escape. The way we try to do it is to have a separate access point and exit point. Then heat up one wall of the space. For example, the outer perimeter of the wall is exposed to sunlight. Because of the pressure, the hot air expands, rises up and exits. The vacuum created will bring in new air. The new air creates a draft which will cool the room.
Ultimately we want to be at peace in our house after a hard day's work. We need to come home and just chill
Decoration
Decoration too, shouldn't be done for the sake of it. It should be done to enhance a space, to provide the space with a sense of purpose. There should be a peaceful cohabitation between the design of the space and the dcor. The best advice someone gave me is to start every project as if you have never designed before. My advice is the same and to be simple.
The grand hotel Water's Edge is a favourite for a wedding or a graduation ceremony. It is a beautiful creation, spacious and expertly designed by Murad.
I don't consider any project my crowning glory. All projects are equal to me. It was initially intended as a golf course but we could never finish it. This was originally an environmental project to retain water that overflowed from the Kelani River. The land was filled up with earth dug from Parliament Lake. We dredged 105 acres of water which was 2m below sea level, 48 acres were left below flood level as marsh, and 48 left above flood level to accommodate the golf course and housing.
We were given the opportunity to go back and complete some of it in 2013 for the CHOGM. Even at that point, it was still not a golf course. The intention for Water's Edge was to be a building to create an economic center in terms of hospitality and recreation. The use has completely changed now, noted Murad finally.

How a Liberal Red Wave Swept Canada on Monday Night
A red wave swept Canada Monday night, propelling Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party to a parliamentary majority and ending the nine-year reign of Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his Conservative Party. And while the comeback victory caught many off guard, the Liberals return to dominance has as much to do with anti-Harper opinion as it does with a well-strategized campaign.
For much of the hard-fought 78-day election campaign, which was the longest in modern Canadian history, all three major political parties were in a statistical dead heat, according to various polls. Even a month before the election, the Liberals were trailing the New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Conservatives, but Trudeaus promises of change and vows to run a campaign based on positive politics galvanized voters and allowed his party to outflank the NDP on the political left and position himself as a lighting rod for anti-Harper sentiment across the spectrum.
We beat fear with hope, Trudeau said during his acceptance speech in Montreal, echoing the hope and change rhetoric that led U.S. President Barack Obama to victory in 2008. We beat cynicism with hard work. We beat negative, divisive politics with a positive vision that brings Canadians together.
Election night for the Liberals began in dramatic fashion, sweeping all of the seats in the Atlantic provinces and going on to take much of Quebec, major urban centers in Ontario, and even some seats in the Conservative stronghold of Alberta.
The Liberals previously held only 34 out of 308 seats in parliament, but shot up to 184 out of 338 after Mondays victory.
The polls hadnt even closed across Canada when the countrys news organizations announced that the Liberals were set to win and that Trudeau, the son of Pierre Elliott Trudeau who was prime minister from 1968 to 1979 and once again from 1980 to 1984, would follow in his fathers footsteps.
For many Canadians, the election became a referendum on Harpers style of rule, which his critics have characterized as heavy-handed and often focused on issues important to only core Conservative supporters rather than the general population.
Shortly before Harpers concession speech before a crowd in Calgary, the Conservative Party released a short statement saying that they would be seeking an interim leader in the coming days, though Harper has not formally announced his resignation. The Conservatives still won 99 seats in parliament, making them the official opposition party. But they are now on the outside looking in after nearly a decade in power.
The Liberals clearly benefited from growing discontent with Harper. In the last elections in 2011, some parliamentary districts, referred to as ridings in Canada, were decided in the Conservatives favor by fewer than 1,000 votes. To avoid such a scenario this time around, many grassroots strategic voting campaigns sprang up across Canada, where nonaligned voters organized online how to pool and swap votes for the candidates that had the best chances to defeat Conservatives in key districts.
Canada has a British-style first-past-the-post system where the electorate only votes for members of parliament. In this system, a plurality of votes is translated into a majority, so the candidate who wins the largest number of votes in a riding wins the seat, even if they dont receive the majority of the vote. In 2011, the Conservatives won a parliamentary majority with 39.6 percent of the national vote.
One such voting campaign, called Vote Together, aimed to take advantage of the system to draw votes away from the Conservatives. By Monday, the campaign had drawn more than 90,000 pledges to switch votes to beat Conservative nominees. If we vote together, we can stop the riding-by-riding vote splitting that lets Harper win, the website reads.
And while Trudeau managed to draw votes away from the political center, he also managed to cut into the NDPs base on Canadas political left. One of the biggest issues in the election was stewardship of the economy, which has stagnated largely because of slumping oil prices. Trudeau said he would spend on infrastructure projects and run modest budget deficits to stimulate the economy. Traditionally a middle of the road party, the position on deficit spending allowed the Liberals to outmaneuver the NDP and their leader Thomas Mulcair, who said they would balance the budget and pay for spending with taxes.
The strategy appeared to work. After Mondays election, the NDP was relegated to Canadas third party, losing many of the ridings in Quebec it had picked up in the previous election to the Liberals.
Now, as the Liberals finish celebrating their victory, the party will have to govern.
Trudeau has promised an ambitious agenda harkening back to the left-of-center policies of previous Liberal governments, including $46 billion ($60 billion CDN) in new infrastructure spending, reforming Canadas electoral system, with an aim to adopt proportional representation, creating national targets for greenhouse gas emissions, and legalizing marijuana.
On foreign policy and security issues, the Liberals also signal change for Canada. Trudeau plans to end Canadas combat mission fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and stick to training Iraqi troops instead. The new prime minister has also vowed to reform parts of Canadas C-51 surveillance act, described by its critics as legislation similar to the Patriot Act, and end the countrys controversial involvement in the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program.
Throughout the election campaign, Trudeaus opponents have tried to use his age and inexperience against him. One Conservative ad that ran on T.V. and radio in Canada listed Trudeaus track record and alleged shortcomings before ending with the tagline: Just not ready.
Now, after a stunning election victory, that slogan will finally get put to the test.

If Music be the Art of Life,
Elizabeth Moir Senior School hosted its annual Art Exhibition at the Lionel Wendt Gallery recently. The theme for this year's exhibition was 'If Music be the Art of Life, Paint on', a twist on Shakespeare's well known quote from Twelfth Night, and perfectly captured the work that was exhibited: a rich fusion of Art and Music.
The talented students employed myriad colours and textures, as well as a variety of media, to depict what music meant to them, including digitally enhancing photographs to add an additional dimension. Art students who received A star grade at the IGCSE also exhibited their work including Young Eun Shin (Grace) who received a 100% for the IGCSE, Anya Gunawansa and Luke Chung who got 95% and Luayyu Khaleel who scored 93%.
Yehali Sangakkara was the Chief Guest and the judge for the parallel Inter House Art competition.
"The way that each team spoke about their house work was inspirational to me. It reinforces my personal experiences and dealings with Moir students in the past as confident achievers," said Sangakkara.
Her words of encouragement and advice were very much appreciated by all the students present, states a media release issued by Elizabeth Moir Senior Schoo.

Indias deadliest epidemic
On May 14, Ramnariam Barma woke up determined to end his life. He had long been pondering this decision, and the governments refusal to compensate him for the loss of his harvest was the straw that broke the camels back. We had been losing money for four years because of the drought, but this winters heavy rains and hail have left us with nothing. I had borrowed 140,000 rupees ($2,200) from the bank and 130,000 more from other loan sharks to pay for seeds and for my oldest daughters dowry, and I knew I could not repay them.
So Barma took a rope, told his wife he was going to the field with the buffaloes, and went instead to a high voltage tower near the hectare of land that he owns. He climbed onto the metal skeleton, knotted the rope, and when he put it around his neck some neighbours saw him. Think of your six children! What will your wife do without you Police also soon arrived, and together they convinced Barma not to hang himself.
But the idea lingers. Now he fears the time when moneylenders, who have stepped up their pressure on him to pay, fearing he will soon commit suicide, will visit him at home with more than threatening words. Someday they will come to torture me. But I have nothing to pay them, and nobody wants to buy my land because it has proven to be quite barren. The government has promised me 9,000 rupees ($140) as compensation, but that cannot pay for feeding or schooling for my children. Barmas youngest child, only 18-months-old, stares at his father while he talks. He is barefoot, dressed only in tattered underwear, and shows a worrying lack of activity for a child of his age. His swollen abdomen indicates severe malnutrition. His mother, Shyambae, holds the baby on her lap and warns Barma: If you kill yourself, I see no reason to continue living.
In the small Indian village of Tendura, a set of dusty streets and mud houses that accommodate some 8,000 people in the northern province of Uttar Pradesh, the drama this family is experiencing comes as no surprise. In fact, in the first five months of this year, as many residents killed themselves. And everyone in the village is convinced that the number will continue to rise, because the harvest has been particularly bad and it adds to four years in which agricultural production has been hampered by another endemic problem: drought. Most of the farmers have contracted debts that they now cant repay. Many dont see another way out, and just between March and May this year 65 people have committed suicide in the Banda district alone, said Raja Bhaiya, director of Vidya Dham Samiti, an organization funded by ActionAid that is launching a grain bank so that farmers can at least eat.
Compensation to families of farmers
Uttar Pradesh is not the only state affected. In fact, suicides have become the deadliest epidemic in India since the country decided to liberalize the agricultural sector in the 1990s. According to official statistics  which numerous NGOs say underscore the magnitude of the problem because they dont include many cases stamped as doubtful  more than 300,000 farmers have taken their lives since 1995. And although the Indian economy is experiencing a golden age, the weight of agriculture in the countrys GDP is falling steadily  currently at 13 percent despite providing jobs to about 50 percent of the workforce  and 2015 is becoming by far the worst year in the past two decades. The number of suicides has doubled in most of the towns in the state. In some it has even tripled, says K. S. Singh Yadar, health superintendent in the city of Lalitpur. Some specialists forecast that this year the toll will top 20,000.
Surrounded by her family, the widow of Boothe Prajapati holds a
			photo of her husband.
For now, the only thing the government is doing to stop this crisis is to grant a controversial 700,000 rupees ($10,700) compensation to the families of farmers who take their lives, which many consider an incentive for farmers to take their own lives. And sometimes it is. Bhagunte Prajapati, a 37-year-old farmer, knows that well. Last March he found his father, Boothe Prajapati, hanging in the family barn.
Boothe was 60, and he believed that the economic boost provided by the compensation after his death was the only way to help his family survive after the loss of almost all their crops.
He had had two taciturn days, barely speaking. I found him dead when I brought him some food. I understand his desperation, because 28 family members depend on the harvest and we only managed to save around 300 kilos out of the six or seven tons we used to collect. Thats not even enough for our own consumption, says his son, the eldest of six siblings and himself father of a further three kids, while holding the graphic image a local newspaper used to illustrate the event. So now we barely have enough to eat and we will have to ask for another loan to cultivate the land next year. If we dont get it I dont know what we can do.
The Prajapati family has already begun the complicated procedures to apply for the government compensation, but they dont know if it will be granted. We are expecting the bank to write off the debt of my father, but he didnt tell us how much he had borrowed from local loan sharks, which generally accumulate an interest of 10 percent per week. We will have to negotiate with them when we are given the compensation. If they actually get it, that is, because the government does everything possible to prevent suicide cases from being certified as such.
We arent worried because the autopsy showed that he hanged himself and the press has published his photograph, but other people have taken their lives in vain.
A doctor at the public hospital in Lalitpur, who requested not to be named, acknowledged the hurdles. It is difficult to deny the obvious when someone has hanged himself or cut his wrists, but it is easier in cases of poisoning. And many of the farmers, around 40 percent of those who commit suicide, choose to do so by drinking pesticide or hair dye. Brijmohan Shukla was one of them. On April 10 he decided to drink the PPD Indians often use to darken their hair.
Demand repayment of a loan
He was only 28-years-old. Some kids found him lying on the side of the road. He had been vomiting something black, and was already dead, recalls his mother, Parvati Shukla. But at the hospital they said he died of natural causes. The autopsy attributes his death to a cardiac arrest, and thats why Brijmohans parents will not receive any compensation.
It is true that intentional poisoning can eventually cause death from a heart attack, but it is also true that there are some families trying to pass a natural death off as suicide to collect the compensation, says Singh Yadar. Parvati, however, claims they are not trying to take advantage of the law. My son was under too much pressure. The bank had begun to send notifications to demand repayment of a loan, and we had arranged his marriage to a girl from a nearby village. But the harvest had been much worse than expected and we have not received any help. A few days earlier he had told me he did not want to live like this, but I thought I had convinced him not to do anything stupid, she recalls, unable to contain her tears. This is how the land collects our debts here.

Kusal Mendis to make Test debut
Sri Lanka will continue with their policy of experimenting with new players when the second Test match against the touring West Indies gets underway at the P. Sara Oval in Colombo today.
The hosts lead the series 1-0 following their emphatic innings victory in Galle and also look set to win the Sobers-Tissera Trophy which is on offer for the first time.
The national selectors have decided to include another promising youngster Kusal Mendis while replacing the out of form Lahiru Thirimanne who has struggled for runs during the recent past.
Rangana Herath will the vice-captain for the match.
The former Sri Lanka U19 World Cup captain has really forced himself into recognition following a series of good scores for the Sri Lanka A team and for the Development Squad during a recent series in India.
In addition controversial spinner Tharindu Kaushal has been left out and his place will be taken by all-rounder Dilruwan Perera who will be making a comeback having played his previous Test match against Pakistan in June this year.
Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews welcomed the inclusion of new cap Kusal Mendis but also emphasised that the left out players could always make a comeback in the future.
"We know every player goes through a rough patch in their career and I hope the players left out will soon bounce back. But at the moment we don't have any choices so we got to make that call" said Mathews.
"Kusal Mendis has earned his place in the side and hope that he will grab that opportunity and cement his place in the side. We are not going to put a lot of pressure on him and we can't expect wonders from him. There will be nervous times for him but we will be there to help him out. As the team captain I will back him all the way. He has the talent and I hope that he will come out good" added the Sri Lanka captain.
Mathews also expected the West Indies to bounce back after their setback in Galle and said that the team will need to play positively if they are to complete a 2-0 whitewash.
"There is a little bit of bounce than it was in Galle. But it looks really dry so the spinners will come into play. Regardless of the wicket we will have to play some good cricket. We got to pick a team which could win the game and I am pretty sure if we could play to our potential we can win the game" added Mathews.
Despite their success in the opening Test, Mathews believed that there is still plenty of room for improvement as the team look to make an impact at a venue which has produced a result in the last ten games.
"As a team we are looking at an improvement in all departments. We can still fine tune in batting, bowling and fielding and we always try to keep on improving and to be as clinical as possible."
Meanwhile the West Indies are likely to make at least one change to their side with Rajendra Chandrika set to replace opening batsman Shai Hope in the line-up.
Even then, they still face a daunting task to regroup and to bounce back with their bowling area as the main concern having conceded nearly 500 runs to their opponents in the first Test.
No doubt the Caribbean islanders will be inspired with the legendary all-rounder Sir Garfield Sobers been present at the venue as a chief guest.
The teams:
Sri Lanka (from): Angelo Mathews (captain), Rangana Herath (vice-captain), Kaushal Silva, Dimuth Karunaratne, Dinesh Chandimal, Kusal Perera, Milinda Siriwardana, Kusal Mendis, Dilruwan Perera, Dhammika Prasad, Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal, Dushmantha Chameera.
West Indies (from): Jason Holder (captain), Kraigg Brathwaite (vice-captain), Devendra Bishoo, Jermaine Blackwood, Carlos Brathwaite, Darren Bravo, Rajendra Chandrika, Shane Dowrich, Shannon Gabriel, Shai Hope, Denesh Ramdin, Kemar Roach, Marlon Samuels, Jerome Taylor, Jomel Warrican.
Free entry for schoolboys
School cricketers and schoolboys will have free entrance to witness the second Test match between Sri Lanka and the West Indies for the Sobers-Tissera Trophy, which begins at the P. Sara Oval in Colombo today.
Legendary cricketer Sir Garfield Sobers and former national captain Michael Tissera will be the chief guest at this match.
School cricketers and schoolboys are requested to come in with their respective school uniform to receive free entry to the venue.

Life-study balance
So you have finally decided on a study or vocational course that you think you might like and which will one day help you to launch a career. But there is a lot more to do before you plunge headlong into these uncharted waters.
Whatever you do, chances are that you will have to attend lectures and even practicals. Therefore the most important thing is to select a good study course and a companion institution to which you can go for lectures. Note that for some courses, such as accountancy, the course/exam provider and lecture provider are often one and the same. Printed study materials too are available from the same institutes, apart from online tutorials and help. You can also order physical materials online which will be delivered to your doorstep, which could actually be cheaper than buying them off the shelf in Sri Lanka.
But even in this case, third party lecture facilities are available from prominent educational institutions. If what you get from the particular institute itself is not adequate in your opinion, you can seek help from these organisations. But do remember that the tuition fees can often be hefty, so you will have to think twice before opening your wallet. If your particular course calls for practicals (such as motor vehicle mechanism and repair), select a very good, reputed institution that has all the facilities.
One can obviously study online these days, so regardless of your course of study make sure that you have a fairly good idea of the online resources available. If you study accountancy as per the aforementioned example, just Googling the words Accountancy Studies will give you a list of online official (institute's own) and unofficial third party resources which will help you to broaden your knowledge further. Some sites do offer one on one help with other students and teachers (some are free, while others levy fees) over Skype, Viber or email. It is worth your time to explore these options and make an investment in a laptop or smartphone (if you haven't already got one) to get online resources right to your screen. It is also a wise idea to invest in an inexpensive Dictaphone or digital voice recorder to record the lectures, especially if they speak fairly fast and you have a hard time catching up by using a conventional pen.
You should also look for likeminded friends who are willing to do the same course(s) together. It is ideal if you have such friends who want to begin the same course with you. But even if you do not have such friends at the start, when you attend lectures at a given institution, you will form many friendships that will help you over the course of the course, so to speak. This way, even if you miss a class, you can always rely on your friends to get those all-important notes. You will be able to study together and also do group assignments together, which help memorize study contents more easily.
Do look for guidance from friends, relatives and mentors who have already "gone through the mill" and successfully completed these courses. They will be able to offer you countless tips to on how to get things right and answer the questions or face practical assignments correctly. Their advice will come in handy as you go on with the course of your choice. Ask them as to what made them tick at exam time. You can also get a good idea of the career options available in the real world if you analyse their present vocations.
It helps if you read articles in the newspapers and on the Web constantly about the latest global developments in the particular course you follow. Thus you will have an enviable advantage over the other students who are limited to "book knowledge". For example, if you follow motor mechanism, reading about the latest developments such as the hydrogen-powered cars from Toyota and Hyundai will give you a head start over the other students - it does not matter if questions on such matters are not presented at the examinations. What matters is that you gain additional knowledge which others do not have or gain.
Finally, it is always prudent to draw up a timetable for your studies. Leverage on the best times for your studies - this can vary from person to person. Remember, studies will give you a better life one day, but it should not be the sole focus of your life in the prime of youth. Relaxing a bit alone or with friends will always help you to concentrate better on the studies in the end. Do not get addicted to a "virtual life" on the social networks in your spare time - it is better to interact in person with other people including your family members. This will help you to balance real life and studies in a harmonious manner.

Locust havoc in Ambagamuwa
A fast spreading spotted locust species causing destruction to the leaves of coconut, arecanut, havaringu and plantain trees is causing great problems and inconvenience to farmers and other cultivators in the Ambagamuwa Divisional Secretariat Division in the Nuwara Eliya district.
Nearly 25 acres in the Hagaratenna and Jambugastenna areas have been affected by the locust menace, said Vidulupra agricultural instructor N.P.B. Herath.
This menace was experienced in the area several years ago. Herath said since the locust feasts on the leaves of the trees at higher elevation, the crops drop in quality and quantity. He said cultivators should contact the Central Province Agriculture Department for assistance and action if they are faced with this problem.

Classical guitar workshops and concert by Dr Paul Cesarczyk
Love affair with guitar
Dr Paul Cesarczyk, award winning Polish-born American music maestro, played his classical guitar at Carnegie Hall when he was a mere seventeen years old. Ever since, he has played at concerts and mentored aspiring musicians worldwide. Today, with the guidance of the Indian Cultural Center, the Asian Guitar Federation and the Guitar Association of Sri Lanka, Sri Lankan ears can feast on his music.
The classical guitar is different from the acoustic guitars we are so used to already seeing in Sri Lanka mostly in that they have nylon strings instead of steel ones. The classical guitar has strings that are light and the instrument is built with woods to emphasize resonance. Dr Paul Cesarczyk described the guitar as "an international instrument," and that it in fact likely originated in Asia itself, and travelled from the East to the West and today, back again. "There is always the process of rebirth in classical music," he added.
Dr.Cesarczyk was joined by Iqbal Mohamed of the Guitar Associaton of Sri Lanka (GASL), AvikSaha President of the Asian Guitar Federation (AGF), and the legendary musician Amaranath Ranatunga himself - described by Saha as "the father of the classical guitar in Sri Lanka" - to make an impassioned plea to the public to help create a "resurgence" of classical music in the country. "It is the beginning of what we believe will be a fruitful journey," said Saha.
Music is without language and the boundaries between genres and media as we saw it once are beginning to blur. The result is a global sound, a diverse fusion of musical feedback - DrCesarczyk himself was born in Poland, with an American passport, who now lives and teaches in Thailand. His workshops and concerts in Sri Lanka are made possible because of the friendship between the Sri Lankan Guitar Association, the Indian Cultural Center, and the Russian Cultural Center: an example on its own of the cultural cohesion that music can bring about.
While Dr Paul Cesarczyk will explore teaching techniques in music, guitar appreciation, and simply the joy of playing the classical guitar, in his workshops - this seems to be the beginning of something much bigger. The Guitar Association of Sri Lanka, and the very recently-born Asian Guitar Federation, who have worked with DrCesarczyk, are striving together to create a cohesive, flourishing 'Asian music circuit' - a platform which will promote Asian music and result in more regular and affordable music festivals in the region. Iqbal Mohamed of the GASL went on to say that music is not the only thing to grow out of these projects - "The classical guitar is a way to switch to poetry, and with its promotion, poets will have a way of coming out too."
"Sri Lanka has the greatest history in the region of the classical guitar - the oldest and most vibrant history," affirmed Saha. It seems to be an exciting time in the country to revive and celebrate music, with the enthusiastic collaboration of the GASL, AGF and our own skilled musicians.
Dr Paul Cesarczyk, whose work has merited him the Andres Segovia Award, the Aaron Copland Prize, the Artists International Award and other awards world-over, feels that the adaptation of the guitar in any country is very simple - it is basically a stringed instrument and all countries already have it in their own forms.
Here lies the opportunity for cultural and artistic fusion among different countries. Dr.Cesarczyk's classical guitar workshops are completely free and have been scheduled for October 20 at the University of Peradeniya, October 21 at the Giragama Teacher Training College in Pilimatalawa, October 22 at the University of Visual and Performing Arts in Colombo, and October 23 at the Indian Cultural Center. The workshops seem to be a build-up to a grand concert featuring the music master himself, on October 24 at the Russian Cultural Center.

The LUX French Rose Revolution is on
Lux has once again revolutionized the way women experience fragrances by infusing it with the fine fragrances in its exciting new range of soap.
Lux Soft Touch and Lux Silk Sensation, the fragrance for both soaps have been created by Master Perfumer Martin Koh and Perfumer Stefanus Agung Nugroho of the reputed House of Firmenich. The two new Re-launched soaps were introduced to local media via a special sensorial experience session held at Arcade in Colombo. Following the media launch the new news of the Best Lux fragrances was brought to life to consumers near arcade and the independence square via a unique Lux Rose Parade which left bystanders and onlookers awestruck!
Presently, roses are one of the key dominant elements in fine fragrance concoctions  a definitive and singular tone that takes centre stage, which is rare in any breed of perfume. Also, unlike in previous eras of trends and tantalizing scents, a fine fragrance isnt limited to a bottle anymore. That is why Lux is different. So rather than use it sparingly and strategically, Luxs fine fragrances give you the chance to immerse yourself in the perfect scent  so the benefit of smelling great isnt just for everyone else, but intimately for you.
The Lux Rose Parade comprising of 50 beautiful girls took to the streets to introduce the two new soaps. The Lux Rose Girls, some on bicycles and some on foot, communicating the LUX fine fragrance message circled the Independence Arcade which was the venue for this spectacular launch.
As the parade took to the streets, the Lux Rose Girls introduced the Lux Soft Touch and Silk Sensation soaps to the large crowds who had gathered by giving away a specially created fragrance infused pink French Roses as a complimentary gift. Soap samples too were handed out, while fragrance strips containing the Fine Fragrance of the Re-launched range were distributed.
At Lux, we work with the worlds best perfumers to create beauty treats infused with fine fragrances. Our goal is for each Lux shower to be a delight to the senses making women feel fabulously feminine, every day, Unilevers skin cleansing category head Nilushi Jayatileke said.
Master Perfumer Martin Koh, of the House of Firmenich, is well-respected for his years of experience in the industry which are marked by creativity and craftsmanship.
LUX Soft touch is a Classic Pink beauty profile, built with an elegant and feminine floral bouquet centered around roses. Fruits blended with an oriental base notes add the blossoming yet caring touches to complete the experience, Koh says.
Perfumer Stefanus Agung Nugroho, also of the House of Firmenich and the creator of Silk Sensation, says that in creating LUX Silk Sensation he was inspired by his travels in India. I wanted to create a scent that evokes the enduring beauty of the people I met. The pure elegance of Indian Jasmine epitomizes that memory. I hope this creation would touch the heart of each and every woman and bring her a smile of happiness, Stefanus adds.
Lux White Silk Sensation has an opulent bouquet of intoxicating white florals , wrapped in the creaminess of musk and precious amber, and the lingering rich aromas of sandal and cedarwood. The LUX Rose parade will tour the streets of Colombo and the suburbs of western province for a period of five days commencing October 20, thus giving consumers an opportunity to experience the new fine fragrance of Lux.

Movie Mania at the British Council
From this month the British Council Arts team is offering a month of movie madness. From their Film Club, to the EU and Colombo International film festivals as well as their James Bond retrospective known as the Bond Binge, British Council Arts is celebrating cinema in a big way.
Many of the British Council's older members wistfully recollect watching their first English movie at the British Council offices. The newly resurrected British Council Film Club opened in July this year to an audience of over a hundred when it screened Hitchcock's The 39 Steps and has just completed its first quarter.
This month on Wednesday 28 October at 6.45pm in commemoration of the International Day of Older Persons, the film club will screen the critically acclaimed film Philomena which is based on the book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee by writer and journalist Martin Sixsmith.
The movie is based on the true story of Philomena, an elderly Irish lady forced to give up her baby for adoption, who spends the next fifty years searching for him. Helped on her quest by Martin Sixsmith, a jaded, cynical journalist, the story describes their journey and how these two unlikely companions become firm friends.
The film was nominated for a host of international awards including four Academy Awards. It stars Dame Judi Dench whose touching portrayal of this elderly lady won her the Oscar for Best Actress.
The British Council has also contributed to the two major film festivals happening in Colombo in early November. For younger audiences the movie Paddington on October 31 2015 at the National Film Corporation Cinema, is not to be missed. It tells the tale of a young bear from darkest Peru who travels to London in search of a new home, and the adventures he has with his new family. http://www.europeanfilmfestsrilanka.com/film/4-tage-im-mai/
For the Colombo International Film Festival, as part of the Bond Binge celebration of James Bond, the British Council will be bringing to Sri Lanka the former Head of Development of EON Productions, the company that makes the Bond movies, to conduct a Master Class on November 10 2015. http://www.iffcolombo.com/masterclass-iffcolombo-2015/
Mr. Alby James will be talking about how to pitch films to the international film industry and will also be talking at a separate British Council event about the Enduring Franchise of the James Bond movies.
The Bond Binge will kick off with a week's screening of old Bond movies from Friday 30 October to 04 November at 7.30 p.m. at the new Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf in Liberty Plaza.

China to help combat kidney diseases
Pilot project for ground water treatment
The Chinese government will launch a pilot project for ground water treatment under the chronic kidney diseases prevention programme of the government.
China also plans to offer a kidney disease treatment hospital and kidney ailment research laboratory to Sri Lanka which will be established in the Anuradhapura district. Chinese help is extended based on the recommendations of a Chinese delegation of experts including geologists, geographers etc. who will be in Anuradhapura on a three-day visit.
The 10-member team is headed by Chinese Academy of Science Deputy Director General Chang Hong Nie.
Their visit is a result of the representation of information about kidney diseases spreading in Sri Lanka by President Maithripala Sirisena during his visit to China in March. During the visit, the Chinese Academy of Science signed an agreement with Sri Lanka's Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage Ministry to conduct a comprehensive investigation and research into the spread of renal ailments in the North Central Province and to offer assistance for a mechanism to purify ground water resources in the affected areas.
NCP's Water Supply and Drainage Board Kidney Disease Prevention Special Water Supply Project chief engineer H. A. Jayasiri said the Chinese delegation would visit Kahatagasdigiliya and Medawachchiya areas where kidney patients are high.
They are to discuss healthcare, welfare etc with patients and families.
The Chinese team will also visit the Katuwela village to inspect the water supply arrangements using reverse osmosis filtering mechanism.

PMK wants TN varsities to conduct distance education in Sri Lanka
Tamil Nadu PMK Leader S. Ramadoss on Tuesday appealed to the University Grants Commission (UGC) to allow universities in Tamil Nadu to conduct correspondence courses in Sri Lanka for the benefit of Tamil students in the island.
The UGC had directed the universities not to run off-campus/ study centre/ outreach centre outside the territorial jurisdiction of the State.
The UGC direction will affect the future of students, particularly 5,000 Tamil teachers in government run schools because the government there had made it mandatory for them to complete degree courses in five years. If distance education centres are closed, they cannot continue their degree courses, Dr. Ramadoss said.
Recalling the stay granted by the Madras High Court on the direction of the University Grants Commission on a petition filed by the Annamalai University, Dr. Ramadoss said though he did not want to go into the details of the case, the UGC should allow universities to conduct distance education in Sri Lanka. The UGC direction will affect the future of students in island nation, Ramadoss said.

Addressing a ceremony at Beruwala to felicitate members of the armed forces who helped end the clash at Dharga town, Beruwala on June 15, 2014, the minister said it was the previous government which internationalised local and domestic issues.
"Sri Lanka is the only country which protested against the UN. Racism received state sponsorship under the previous regime," Dr. Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the clash in Dharga town led the Muslims to vote against the previous government.
"The Armed Forces did an excellent job to solve the issue and establish peace. Rs. 250 million was allocated for rehabilitation work but broken hearts cannot be mended easily," he said.

Rain check on crimes during war
This report is a call to Sri Lankans of all communities to examine their history and take control of their present; to acknowledge the degeneration of the country and its democratic institutions, to demand justice for the crimes that have been committed in the name of fighting terrorism or securing Eelam, and to declare never again. - UTHR(J) Special Report No: 34 , December 13, 2009.
Wars are crimes. No less, no more. Holy wars and just wars included. We have had huge debates and much beating of chests over this topic since 2012.
If an eye witness who walks through vehicles lying and or stopped bumper to bumper on both sides of a road characterized as a high way to hell with dead people within the vehicles, a man now aged fifty nine carrying shards of shrapnel even now, loses his wife and four children, with the eldest being nineteen in one incident in a bunker, a young woman with two infants loses consciousness whilst breast feeding her child because she is hit by shrapnel and is hospitalised for seven months in Anuradhapura Hospital with the child she breast fed dying on the spot unknown to her, if a woman of twenty nine whose husband and brother were members of the LTTE do not come back home, if a man survives with two children whilst losing one leg and the wife dying, a young boy stops schooling before his OLs since the parents die to take care of two younger girl siblings, we seem to have examples of a human toll due to war. Crimes or otherwise.
Domestic process for reconciliation
A passage from UTHR(J) from the publication cited earlier says, On 8th February the Army had entered Iruddumadu and was on the doorstep of Suthanthirapuram. Satheeshkumar was a 35 prisoner on a non-political charge. Intelligence chiefs Pottu Amman and Kapil Amman came to Tango Ten. The prisoners pleaded with them to be freed. After discussing among themselves, Pottu Amman decided to free all those arrested on non-political charges not dealing with security. The remaining 140 were to be executed. This group included members of rival Tamil parties, especially the EPDP, and Sinhalese and Muslims detained over allegations of security connections. Satheeshkumar said that they were killed and burnt in the nearby jungle (Source: UTHR(J) Special Report No: 34 - December 13, 2009).
When this piece is published Parliament would have debated the contents of the Reports commonly known as those by Justices Udalagama and Paranagama respectively. We could likely see an all - party conversation on what would be best seen as a domestic mechanism.
Irrespective of the outcomes this piece presents some thoughts.
The domestic process for reconciliation and accountability looks at truth and compassion, the missing, reparation and prosecution. In the name of freedom, Tamil youth bearing arms killed and maimed those they considered their foes. The state armed with emergency and legislative powers emanating from the Prevention of Terrorism Act acted to suppress violent dissent equally if not more ferociously violently with all resources in their armoury. Preceding this era, flawed policies and select practices of the State drove youth to bear arms. We are now counting and accounting for the toll.
Our inability to find consensus widened the mistrust amongst key segments of society resulting in an internationalized issue. While Law may assist to come to conclusions, the political spectrum has equal responsibility as UTHR(J ) has stated to to examine their history and take control of their present. It requires painful introspection. Uncovering the truth in term of political responsibility would imply all parties acknowledging their share of the responsibility for what happened, learning from the lessons of the past and moving forward to a durable process of peace and reconciliation.
Sepala Ekanayake case
We are currently faced with a situation where a credible domestic process has to be instituted. It must though take into account the work of preceding commissions of inquiry.
Our Constitution has an interesting passage in Chapter III focused on Fundamental Rights. It states in section (6) No person shall be held guilty of an offence on account of any act or omission which did not, at the time of such act or omission, constitute such an offence, and no penalty shall be imposed for any offence more severe than the penalty in force at the time such offence was committed.
It goes onto state - Nothing in this Article shall prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by the community of nations.
This section of our Constitution has been tested and interpreted. It was in the Sepala Ekanayake case of hijacking an aircraft belonging to Alitalia. His action forced the government of Sri Lanka to pass retrospective legislation to take legal action against him. He was the first person to be tried under Act No. 24 of 1982 certified on July 26,1982. Ekanayake committed this offence between June 29 and July 1, 1982. At that time there was no legislation to prosecute Ekanayake for the crime he committed. Every nation is expected to have passed domestic law based on the Hague and the Montreal Conventions ratified in 1987 by 131 nations. The main purpose of the Hague and Montreal Conventions is to curb the alarming menace of hijacking of airplanes. Sri Lanka was compelled to give effect to these conventions after Ekanayake hijacked the Alitalian aircraft. The Sri Lanka Parliament passed the Offences Against Aircraft Act and created room for Ekanayake to be tried in court. The international community was anxious that Parliament passed the Act with retrospective effect from 1978. It was an assurance that Ekanayakes criminal activates would not go unpunished. The Offences Against Aircraft Act of 1982 was decreed to be law from 1978 and incorporated the relevant provisions of the Hague Convention.
This was the first case in Sri Lanka where legal proceedings were, for the lack of local laws, resorted to on the basis of international law. A pronouncement was made that skyjacking an aircraft was an international crime and was an offence under international customary law. In preference to extraditing a local hero for trial in Italy, Parliament on July 26, 1982 passed a law making skyjacking an offence with retroactive effect. This was made possible by an ambiguity in Fundamental Rights legislation. The article concerned on FR was qualified by: Nothing in this article shall prejudice the trial or punishment of a person for any act or omission which at the time it was committed was criminal according to the general principles of law recommended by the community of nations. A passage quoted earlier. Hence it seems we are bound by international customary law so interpreted by our Courts even in the absence of crimes codified in domestic law in this instance against hijacking an aircraft or now those pertaining to crimes of the order referred in UN resolutions since 2012.
It would thus seem we have judicial interpretation and precedence linking international customary law, our Constitution and the meaning of the reference to general principles of law recommended by the community of nations.
Special courts
As we move forward whilst benches can be constituted to sit in special courts including potentially to sit on site in scores of locations within geographically demarcated areas in the theatre of past conflict, the crimes to be investigated need to be framed. In pursuing the gathering of facts the special courts could seek the assistance of, if not commission experts both local and foreign to gather facts and present to Court. Likewise where matters of the missing, or presentation of the truth is required leading to compassion or restitution there is nothing to prevent hybrid fact finding groups to work in unison.
The focus must always be on victims of the war. As Desmond Tutu in The Book of Forgiving: The Fourfold Path for Healing Ourselves and Our World says, The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen. We need such people to lead us in all the elements constituting our domestic process.

Certain cancers such as Thyroid cancer has increased by six or seven percent. Forty five people die due to smoking daily and it is tobacco which kills the highest number of people. If this trend continues, many young Sri Lankans around 35 years will die before their parents, Government Medical Officers Association President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya said.
He said over 30 percent of Sri Lankan children are overweight while the number of Sri Lankans with cancers has doubled.
Senior lecturer, Medicine Department of Clinical Medicine University of Colombo and Consultant Endocrinologist/Diabetologist. Dr. Prasad Katulanda said a research conducted in 2006 revealed that around 10 percent of Sri Lankans suffer from diabetes.
The research also revealed that another 10 percent have pre-diabetes condition. A 2015 research revealed this percentages has increased to 25 percent. One in every five Sri Lankans have diabetes or pre-diabetes, he said.
Addressing the media at the Government Information Department Auditorium, Colombo, he said 50 percent of adults in Colombo district suffer from diabetes/ pre-diabetes.
More middle aged persons have diabetes which affect the entire population including the country's economy. Diabetes leads to many other serious diseases, Dr. Katulanda said. Royal College Principal Upali Gunasekara said three main queues can be seen in the evening when traveling around the country.
They are the queues at shops selling liquor, the queues at shops selling short eats and queues at private hospitals to channel specialist doctors, he said.
Gunasekara said around 15,000 schoolchildren from 150 schools in Colombo will take part in heartbeat walk to be held on October 24 from Nelum Pokuna to Royal College.

A tale of beads
If a new and exotic genre of jewellery is likely to take your fancy, book a date for Saturday (24 October) to view Pabalu, an exhibition of finely-crafted beadwork necklaces, earrings and pendants happening at the Lionel Wendt, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The exhibition showcases the creative talents of Janaki Pethiyagoda, who employs kumihimo, a technique of braiding strands of cord to create intricate coloured braids first invested in Japan. Some 170 exotic items are to be on show, most of them available for sale at very reasonable prices.
Having acquired her skills under leading experts in Australia and the United States, Janaki has brought her own flavour of stylistic elegance to kumihimo. Since multiple strands of cords are used, she says, the necklaces are very strong but slender. Samurai warriors once used kumihimo as laces for their armour. In fact, even the traditional belt of the kimono was bound by a cord of kumihimo. In earlier times, she says, a traditional tool known as a marudai used to be employed to form the chains. This used about eight strands of thread to form a braid. But today this has been revolutionized and beaders have invented a portable disk in its place. Adding beads to braids is a relatively recent innovation to this ancient technique, she explains. Designing a piece of bead jewellery is quite a challenge, she says.
But once you master the art, it is fascinating to create your own designs and colour-schemes. In recent times, different new types of beads coming in to the market has attracted international interest and launched the craft to a wider base of users internationally. This has made it possible for the beading community and jewellery designers worldwide to innovate fascinating designs which are also original. Swarovski and Preciosa, traditional Czech bead-makers, are continually inventing new beads and paving the way for new designs. Super Duos, Double twin beads, Triangle beads, and Rivolies, to mention just a few. Japanese Toho and Miyuki seed-beads in different sizes too, are used for bead weaving, using an altogether different technique. Whenever I travel, says Janaki, I head straight for the local bead store and pick up local specialties. As a result of a trip to Italy last May, for example, she discovered the beautiful beads and focals made in Murano, the famous glassworks. Most of these can be seen on necklaces at the exhibition, she adds.
The stitches used to make jewellery are ancient but universal, explains Janaki. So it becomes a common language worldwide. Social media, she adds, have helped the craft enormously. It is a small community of beaders scattered across the globe, but through Facebook, beaders living in different countries can communicate and exchange their designs and ideas with astonishing speed. Janaki's passion for beads began when she started a course in jewellery-making in Sydney, Australia. The course was intensive, working with silver, copper and steel, amongst other metals. This was exciting, she says, but you had to work within the framework of a well-equipped studio, complete with industrial equipment and kilns. It was far too involved and expensive to do as a hobby, in our small apartment.
But when she started designing with beads, which was another module of the same course, she realized that here was something she could do within the comfort of her home. It was therapeutic, and for her it has now become a passion. The result of this addiction is a collection of two years work, leading to her first exhibition.
It is an enormously creative and enjoyable way to spend your time, she says. I hope some interesting people will come to the exhibition, be excited by what they see, and want to learn the art. For my part, I have no secrets: I am happy to teach what I know! she noted.

US, Russia set rules for air safety over - Syria
US: The United States and Russia have signed a memorandum of understanding that establishes measures so their pilots steer clear of each other as they conduct separate bombing campaigns in Syria, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
It's a significant step that follows several instances in which Russian and US planes or drones have come close to each other, raising the nightmare prospect of a mid-air collision or some other dangerous encounter.
Speaking to reporters in the Pentagon, press secretary Peter Cook said the document had been signed earlier in the day and had taken effect immediately.
"There's a series of protocols in place that effectively are intended to avoid any sort of risk of a mid-air incident between our air crews and Russian air crews," Cook said.
"If they follow these protocols, we should not have the risk of engagement with Russian air crews over Syria."
Moscow also reported that both countries had signed the memorandum of understanding (MOU), which boils down to some fairly standard air safety protocols.
Cook said these include guidelines on professional airmanship, as well as the use of radio frequencies and the creation of a secondary line of communication on the ground.
However, he was quick to stress that the understanding did not signal broader agreement with Russia's Syria strategy to support President Bashar al-Assad.
"The MOU does not establish zones of cooperation, intelligence-sharing or any sharing of target information in Syria," he said.
"We continue to believe that Russia's strategy in Syria is counter-productive and their support for the Assad regime will only make Syria's civil war worse."
The United States is leading a 60-plus member coalition targeting Islamic State jihadists in Iraq and Syria and has been carrying out frequent raids for more than a year.
Russia also claims to be targeting IS and other "terrorists," but the Pentagon says it is hitting non-IS rebels fighting forces loyal to Assad.
Implementation of the MOU follows a string of potentially serious incidents in the Syrian skies.
On one occasion, a coalition plane had to scrap a bombing run because Russian planes were already in the area.
Military spokesman Colonel Steve Warren said that last week, a Russian plane flew within 1,500 feet (450 meters) of two US planes.
CNN, which first reported the incident Tuesday, also said a Russian plane had flown within 500 feet (150 meters) of a US jet in another encounter. Warren was unable to immediately confirm that report.
"This should give our pilots -- if the Russians abide by it -- some measure of comfort that these kinds of incidents can be avoided altogether and that there's no need for them to have an encounter if everyone is abiding by these rules," Cook said. Russian planes have also flown close to US drones.

Wars, warriors and war crimes
It has been observed that never a day passes in the global context without hearing the terms linked to war. War is defined and understood in many ways from times immemorial. As social scientists and philosophers point out, the wars have begun as a result of tribal conflicts that existed in the most ancient societies. The origins of which are unfathomable.
Wars in the modern world are said to be planned and adopted as a measure of winning one sector over and above another. The entire war culture has given way to quite a number of studies linked to the terms such as war strategies, war crimes, war zones, war stories, war victims and war heroes.
Whatever said and done, the concept of war is not taken as a virtuous measure for the well being of human existence.
Leo Tolstoy wrote a wonderful narrative named as War and Peace (1862-69) where he visualises the picture of Russia set against a background of Napoleons invasion. The work is great as a result of placing the human context of peaceful living as against the cruelties caused by war. Tolstoy is sensitive and brings in a large number of victimizations caused by war.
He peeps into various issues connected sociologically, psychologically, politically and historically into the lives of people torn between the normal and the tragic situations. Tolstoy never approved of human victimization in bloodshed and cruelties caused by venomous warfare. The novel was written at a time when the term war crimes was never heard of. But the average masses knew its meaning intimately.
Perhaps the term came to be used widely since the Second World War. The crimes caused as a result of warfare cannot be visualized as mere happenings. Attorney at Law and Chairman of the Sri Lanka Press Council, Koggala Wellala Bandula, points out in his latest book, Yuda Aparadha (War Crimes Godage 2015), wars cannot be won without creating crimes which are numerous and unpardonable.
In his resourceful and stimulating study he states that quite a number of disasters take place as war crimes. Initially as he points out the innocent civilians are faced with death and dispossession. Then the children and women are victimized and die regardless of their birthright as humans. They are innocent and normal human beings who are also physically and mentally deranged and victimized.
An industry springs up with the manufacture of war weapons. They bring unforeseen disasters. As he says initially, it is just one rifle shot or gun power that brings about this disaster. The soldiers are trained and their minds are made to suit the use of weapons for destruction of the enemy front.
Koggala Wellala Bandula in his eye-opening contribution points out those war crimes could be classified into various groups. Accordingly he shows how this has been formulated by various peace seeking human agencies down the years. The bringing about harm to the living creatures and the living environments is basically a matter to be taken seriously. In the name of war humans are seen reduced to the utmost evil state of living. Most crimes without much awareness could be caused in the name of war.
It is possible to create a crime undermining the ethics of the civil society which yearns for a peaceful existence. But with the declaration of a war it is nevertheless disturbed. It too hampers the medical services, religious movements, educational climates, food production and lawful living conditions and brings about calamities to human properties both personal and public.
It is also visualized as Bandula in his research shows that the plunder of wealth too takes place hand in glove with the killing of humans. War continues in various types of racial and ethnic mini battles. With copious examples, the author shows how this happens. He selects a global standpoint in his drawing of examples and gradually pinpoints some of the local situations.
Bandula shows that with war, the human understandings are reduced to the basic levels of degeneration causing the most number of disasters eroding the humane aspects. He shows as one solid example of how the schools were bombarded in Vietnam on the part of the enemy forces allowing children and teachers to die in pain.
On reading this work I detected that this document running to 152 pages is just not an essay on the war crimes. It is a sensitive research project where the reader will share the war crimes drawn from various countries such as Israel, Gautamala, South Africa, Vietnam El Salvador, Ireland, Lebanon Cambodia and needless to say Sri Lanka. All these are drawn from genuine sources culled and inserted with care impartially and painstakingly. With facts and figures thus obtained from sources, he also tries to underline the types of weapons and other chemicals utilised in warfare in the name of technological advancement.
As a measure to win a battle he sees that the tragedy of employing children in warfare as child soldiers where the humane quality of living had reduced to the cruelest level detestable. He also sees the tragedy of making use of human body parts in the field of medicine and medical research as a war crime. The experiments laid on the victims become a war crime as a result of the inhuman non sensitivity of the victors. Another war crime is the allowance of people to be in hunger as a result of the plunder of food material. Many more are laid down for the scrutiny of those interested in not only war crimes but also in humanism.
All these impediments and violations on the quality of living and the basic right to exist on the earth planet as a result of war are regarded as war crimes. Great treaties and conferences have been held over the years to eradicate and bring about a total stop to war crimes. But has it been implemented properly
The writer cum researcher Wellala Bandula uses a simple readable style of writing in the pronouncement of his thesis which makes the reader feel that creative communicators who utilize mass media channels such as print sound and visual have a vital role to play in depicting the terrible horrendous situations that are created via war crimes. The writer researcher opens our eyes on the Geneva protocol as well as other human rights movements of the United Nations pinpointing the needs of the day as aftermath of two world wars and numerous other communal racial and ethnic wars around the globe.

Whither the balance of power 
The ever changing domestic political landscape is set to undergo yet another transformation as the next elections to choose representatives to local government bodies throughout the country looms ahead and could be held as early as in March next year.
The poll also pits the two constituent parties of the government, the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) directly against each other. They were rivals at the August general election but the latter contested only as the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and President Maithripala Sirisena did not actively participate in that campaign.
The UNP, rejuvenated at the grassroots level after their victory at the general election despite not obtaining an overall majority, will be keen to restore the balance of power in local government institutions which has over the past decade passed on to the UPFA throughout the country with the exception of a few urban councils and municipalities. It will also be keen to use the poll as a barometer of its performance after more than a year in office, first as an interim government without parliamentary power and then as a more stable administration.
Allegations of corruption
It is in the UPFA and the SLFP that the storm clouds are gathering. This is because the rivalry between President Sirisena and his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa - already tested at the presidential and general elections - will emerge for a third time at this poll.
Although the UPFA contested as a single political entity at the August elections, it is no secret that there was a tug of war between the Sirisena and Rajapaksa factions. After much bickering Rajapaksa was granted nominations but the President went public with his sentiments stating that Rajapaksa would not be granted the Premiership that he was seeking. That spat was much ado about nothing as the UPFA emerged second best at the election.
However, the fact that most Rajapaksa loyalists - including those from outside the SLFP- secured impressive numbers of preference votes despite allegations of corruption against at least some of them while most supporters of the President lost, has not gone unnoticed. President Sirisena attempted to redress the balance somewhat, packing the UPFA National List with his nominees, some of them being defeated candidates at the general election.
The President now wants the SLFP to contest the Local Government elections on its own, instead of as the UPFA. In any event, several constituent parties of the alliance, such as the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (led by Wimal Weerawansa), Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (led by Dinesh Gunewardena), the Democratic Left Front (led by Vasudeva Nanayakkara), the Communist Party (led by D.E. W. Gunasekara), the Lanka Samasamaja Party (led by Tissa Vitarana) and the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (led by Udaya Gammanpila) are vehemently opposed to the current trajectory of the SLFP.
Rajapaksa loyalists
Conversely, Sirisena loyalists view these parties as parasites of the SLFP within the UPFA. They have only a miniscule national base votes but depend on the SLFP bulk vote to gain representation with their high profile stalwarts then getting elected due to the large numbers of preference votes they attract at the expense of long suffering SLFPers.
Because of this, the parting of ways between the SLFP and the UPFA may occur at the Local Government elections - and the divergence in thinking between the UPFA and SLFP is not the only reason for that: the Rajapaksa factor will also come in to play quite decisively.
Although many Rajapaksa loyalists gained entry to Parliament at the recent elections, they were treated in different ways by the SLFP hierarchy. Some, who showed a willingness to co-operate with President Sirisena were elevated to Cabinet rank. This includes party seniors such as Nimal Siripala de Silva, Susil Premajayantha and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, the latter duo being accommodated despite being blatantly loyal to Rajapaksa during the general election campaign.
Others, mostly those who have remained steadfast in their loyalty to Rajapaksa, have been side-lined. In fact, the President has told some of these parliamentarians that they could choose to sit in the Opposition if they wished to but that they should not violate party discipline. Throughout all this, Rajapaksa himself has kept a low profile.
The Local Government elections provide these political forces - those still loyal to Rajapaksa within the SLFP and the smaller parties of the UPFA - with an opportunity to converge. SLFPers who do so will no doubt face the wrath of the party leadership but it is left to be seen what action would be taken against them. President Sirisena failed to punish parliamentarians who flocked to the Bring Back Mahinda campaign during the general election but, with no major national elections on the horizon for another five years, he may do so now. Again, in previous such instances, mostly in the UNP, aggrieved MPs have taken their cases to court and have been successful in safeguarding their parliamentary seats.
Local Government Councils
Rajapaksa loyalists are confident of a strong performance in the event a new alliance - with the former President as their undeclared leader - is formed. This is due to several reasons. Firstly, Local Government Councils have been packed with Rajapaksa loyalists over the past ten years. As incumbent members of their councils, they enjoy name recognition and some standing in the communities they represent. If these representatives continue their loyalty to a new alliance that enjoys Rajapaksas tacit support, their contribution would be vital. Again, not all of them will do so; some of them will invariably switch allegiance to the mainstream SLFP, like their colleagues in Parliament did.
The other reason that Rajapaksa loyalists feel they can register a strong performance at the Local Government elections is what they see as their main campaign issue: the governments stance in co-sponsoring the recent resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva. Their campaign would be themed on accusing the government (the UNP, the SLFP and President Sirisena in particular) of selling out to western interests and of sacrificing war heroes at an inquiry into alleged war crimes.
Whether such a slogan which has a national context will reverberate with voters at an election that chooses representatives who manage their local culvert or their garbage collection is a moot point. It is also relevant to note that voters are now election weary, having participated in two hotly contested and distracting national elections already.
While the SLFP and its factions are gearing up for the polls, there is another argument brewing between the mainstream SLFP and the UNP as to how the polls should be conducted. A previous parliamentary committee headed by Dinesh Gunewardena recommended a hybrid between the first past the post and Proportional Representation (PR) systems. The UNP is keen on elections on a PR system while the SLFP wishes for polls on a first past the post basis. This is a repeat of the dispute the two major parties had before the general election, with the SLFP pushing for the 20th Amendment to the Constitution incorporating electoral reforms and the UNP being not too keen to pursue them.
Traditionally, Local Government elections hardly inspire the masses, especially if they have been dragged through two bruising national elections already. This local poll might manage to do just that though, because it has the capacity to redefine the political forces in the country and provide an answer to a question that most Sri Lankans would like a definite answer to: is the country essentially a two party democracy or is there still room for a third party which could substantially influence the balance of power
