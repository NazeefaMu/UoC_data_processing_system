Doctors call for public-private partnership in education
The government should ensure that a child can follow the courses of his or her choice just as much as it provides free education, Movement of Doctors for the Freedom of Education Chairman, Consultant Neurosurgeon Dr. Deepal Attanayake said.
He said so at a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday. Dr.Attanayake said the government should not hinder the paths to freedom of education. There should be a public-private partnership in education according to strict methodology and standards.
The government should allow the private medical institutions that maintain proper standards, to enable students who fail to gain admission to government medical colleges by just a few marks to gain admission and pursue their career. The Kothalawala Defence Academy was established to produce doctors during the conflict period. Therefore, we need more doctors specially during any emergency situation, he said adding that this would enable the country to reach the WHOs prescribed doctor-to-patient ratio and ensure a more inclusive and accommodating education system in the country.
The standards maintained by private educational institutions are in no way inferior to that of their state counterparts although facilities and approach may differ. There is an alarming disparity between the demand for doctors as per the growth of the population and the entrance of new doctors into the system. Hundreds of thousands of aspiring and capable students have already been disenfranchised by the shortcoming of the tertiary education system and its time strong, new policies were enacted to transform this dire situation, he added.
We urge all concerned citizens to rally round the call of the doctors for freedom of education to urge the authorities to support more private educational institutions in this country, which will encourage foreign exchange savings by students obtaining their degrees in Sri Lanka, whilst thwarting the brain drain, said Dr. Attanayake. If all the other subjects are covered by the private universities, so why not medicine
Consultant Ontological Surgeon, Dr. L.M. Pathmalal said that those who studied at private universities never had to line up for jobs. We should examine whether the country has benefited by the vast amount of funds spent by the government on free education. The government should provide opportunities for students to study courses of their choice.
What is the solution the government offers the 90 percent of students who cannot gain admission to the government medical colleges he queried.

Even exchanges on first day of Battle of the Babes
The opening days play in the 59th Battle of the Babes encounter between Vidyartha College and St Sylvesters College saw the exchanges even at the Pallekele international stadium yesterday.
Winning the toss and inviting St Sylvesters to bat first Vidyartha bowlers ran through the batting to dismiss them 20 minutes before tea for 134.
Vidyartha in reply lost two wickets for 37 in 19 overs when bad light ended play 37 minutes before the scheduled close.
A solid bowling performance by the Vidyartha bowlers saw the Sylvestrians lose half their side for 73 by lunch. This was due to accurate bowling backed up by some tidy fielding which halted the Sylvestrians from making runs.
Top scorer for St Sylvesters was Jayantha Rajapakse with a well compiled 40. The bowling honours were shared by Nimesh Ekanayake (3/23), Nipuna Kumarasiri (2/27) and Avishka Upananda (2/16).
The Sylvestrians hit back quickly to capture the first wicket for four runs.
Scores:
St. Sylvesters College 134 in 63 overs (Jayakantha Rajapakse 40, Parinda de Silva 19, Nimesh Ekanayake 3/23, Nipuna Kumarasiri 2/27, Avishka Upananda 2/16)

Geoffrey Boycott remembers John Hampshire
Their rivalry was public and occasionally bitter, but their friendship ran deeper. The death on Thursday at 76 of John Hampshire sent Geoffrey Boycotts mind racing back to a lost world of cricket in the old West Riding, of scoring runs with Dickie Bird and Michael Parkinson, and cadging petrol from passing drivers on the way home.
Jack Hampshire had served as president at Headingley for the past year, but it is with an earlier, golden, age of cricket in Yorkshire that his name is synonymous.
Alongside Boycott, Brian Close and Ray Illingworth, he was part of a team that took the county championship seven times in ten years. Eventually, he took charge of the side.

For 20 years John Hampshire thrilled Yorkshire's crowds with his attacking strokeplay and in1969 scored a century on his Test debut against the West Indies at Lord's.
The man he ousted as captain in 1979 was in reflective mood.
Boycott had met Hampshire, he said, as 14 year-olds, their ages just a few months apart.
I grew up with him. He was a young kid at Barnsley when I played with Parkinson and Dickie Bird, Boycott told The Yorkshire Post from his second home in South Africa. John was getting rave notices for his performances at Rotherham Town. He made the Yorkshire first team before I did and I always thought hed have a wonderful career.
Money was tight in the Sixties, Boycott said, and with no cash coming in from TV rights, Yorkshire could only run to six cars to get the players to and from games. You had to double up with someone, and John and I travelled together a lot. One time I ran out of petrol and we had to go out with a can, searching for fuel. As if that wasnt bad enough, I did it a second time, pitch dark and no-one in sight, in the middle of Cambridgeshire.
Hampshire, whose death followed a long battle with cancer, was defined by his dependability, Boycott said. He was easy company, no airs and graces. Play, perform, go home, find a beer. It was a workaday side to a cricketers life the public didnt see. Most liked to imagine that the Yorkshire side consisted of ill-matched and uncompromising curmudgeons, riven with rivalry and resentment. Sometimes, they were. In 1978, Hampshire led a go-slow on the pitch at Northampton, after Boycott had taken six hours to amass 113 runs. It cost his side a bonus point and Boycott the captaincy. Amid some acrimony, Hampshire replaced him but only for two seasons, before upping sticks to Derbyshire.
Its every boys dream to be captain, but Im not sure it was right for him, Boycott said. But he became a very good umpire. Cricket was in his blood and that was his way of staying connected to the game he loved.
Im so pleased that he was president before he died. There had been Illy, Closey and me, and he fully deserved it.
Yorkshires chief executive, Mark Arthur, concurred, calling Hampshire humble, modest and unassuming.
He said: He came as a young apprentice, worked his way up and played internationally.
He was an outstanding ambassador for the club, and he had a great relationship with the current crop of players - you dont always find that.
The former Yorkshire and England skipper, Michael Vaughan, called Hampshires death a sad, sad day for Yorkshire cricket, adding on Instagram: John Hampshire gave me so much advice down at Abbeydale Park in Sheffield... always with a nice dry sense of humour.

GMOA should act in a more professional manner: Wijayadasa
Justice Minister Dr. Wijayadasa Rajapakshe yesterday took on the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) highlighting that its conduct does not qualify it to be a professional body.
The minister addressing the ceremonial inauguration of National Law Week 2017 at the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) auditorium drew a comparison between the the BASL and the GMOA.
At a time like this, when some of the professional bodies are holding patients who seek hospital treatment to ransom for their own selfish demands and privileges, the BASL is an exemplary professional body. The BASL is giving their fullest support to educate the people, to protect the rights of the people, thereby enhancing the quality of the peoples lives, he said.
The minister made this comment in appreciation of the BASL initiative to provide free legal aid to the public during the National Law Week, a concept initiated by late Justice C.G. Weeramantry.
The minister pointed out lack of independence of the judiciary and delay in justice were the two main challenges the current Government had to confront with when it assumed duties two years back.
We did steer clear the name and image of the judiciary. One cannot anymore say our judiciary is biased,but still the delay in justice is an issue we are facing. There is an increase of disposal of cases, and we are now engaged in law reforms to address the delay. We are also in the process of translating important Statutes to Tamil, and so far five Statutes including the Criminal Procedure Code, Civil Procedure Code and Penal Code have been completed, Minister Rajapakshe said.
A booklet titled Legal Handbook containing basic knowledge of law in simple language was also launched at the event.
Chief Justice Piyasath Dep delivering his first speech at a formal gathering after assuming duties, pointed out the importance of raising awareness among the people on the countrys law. To access the law, you must know the law. The income levels of the people should not be a factor that decides the level of access to legal advice, he said.
BASL President Geoffrey Alagaratnam,Secretary Amal Randeniya, Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya and many others participated in the event presided by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Govt.s silence to protests may bring about countrywide union action: GMOA
If the relevant authorities follow a deaf, dumb and blind policy towards the anti SAITM protests, there is a danger of taking more serious countrywide trade union action soon, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
He said so while addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday morning. He said that even the Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) had revealed that SAITM did not have the authority to offer degrees, as reported by the media recently. The Government should immediately take over this fraudulent institution and put it under a state mechanism, he said.
According to Dr. Zoysa, the SAITM issue could be solved quickly and easily by gazetting the minimum standards of medical education in Sri Lanka, adding the Health Ministers signature to the Report issued by the Technical Committee of the Sri Lanka Medical Council on SAITM in order to make it legal and informing Courts that SAITM lacked the authority to offer degrees (this should be done by the Higher Education Minister). The former Higher Education Minister S.B. Dissanayake had used his powers arbitrarily.
The four hour strike launched in Western Province state hospitals yesterday, extended till last midnight due to the silence of the relevant authorities towards the SAITM issue. The protest walk commenced from near the Colombo National Hospital and ended at the Viharamaha Devi Park. The protest rally was held with a large number of protesters at the Viharamaha Devi Park in Colombo yesterday. The roads leading to Town Hall, Maradana and Punchi Borella, were blocked due to the protest.

The world's top class spinner Muthiah Muralitharan will grace the opening ceremony of the Trinity-St. Anthonys 100th big match next Friday at Pallekele Stadium. Born in Kandy at the age of 9 Muralitharan was admitted to St. Anthony's College, Kandy. He began his cricketing career as a medium pace bowler but on the advice of his junior coach, Sunil Fernando, he took up to off-spin when he was 14 years old. He soon impressed and went on to play for four years in the senior team as an all-rounder and batted in the middle order. In his final two seasons he took over hundred wickets and in 1990/91 was named as the 'Bata Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year. He played for Kandy CC and later joined Tamil Union. He was selected for the Sri Lanka A tour of England in 1991. He played in five games but failed to capture a single wicket. On his return to Sri Lanka he impressed against Allan Border's Australian team in a practice game and then went on to make his Test debut at the R. Premadasa Stadium in the second Test of the series. He retired from Test cricket in 2010, registering his 800th and final wicket on 22 July 2010 with his final ball in his last Test match.
Another Sri Lanka great Kumar Sangakkara will be chief guest at the Trinity-Antonian limited overs match on March 18 at Asgiriya Stadium. Sangakkara will not be available for the Big Match due to his other commitments.
Wesley was in Kandy on a goodwill visit
Last week the Principal of Wesley College along with the Chaplain, Captain and Vice Captain of the rugby team paid a visit to Trinity College to meet the Principal, Rugby Captain and the Vice Principal. This visit was due to the unwanted incident which occurred at the Trinity-Wesley rugby game at Longden Place. Further it was very nice of the captain and the vice captain to present a rugger ball signed by them to symbolize the friendship. In rugby a bit of rough play is part of the game, but this is only between the players when the referee intervenes and controls, and certainly not by the spectators and public. Wesley and Trinity have a long history of friendship and camaraderie in the sporting field. They first met at rugby in 1957, which game Trinity won, then at cricket in 1903 - that was a win for Wesley, then in 1950 in hockey where Trinity won.

Kantale sugar plant to recommence operations: BOI Chairman
The Kantale sugar plant will recommence operations after a lapse of 24 years under a foreign investment, Board of Investment (BOI) Chairman Upul Jayasuriya said.
He said that the Kantale sugar factory had not been operating for over 24 years and therefore no production is made. This situation brings immense hardships to over 20,000 farming families, which cultivate sugar canes for the factory for years.
Then the BOI took measures to recommence the factory with an investment of a foreign investor. Under this project, which will be carried out as a private-public partnership, the British investor will invest US $ 100 million (Rs 150 billion) to the project. The investor has planned to introduce high-breed sugar cane variety, which produces a high yield to the sugar cane cultivators of the area with a technical assistance of an Indian company, Jayasuriya said.
The Chairman was addressing the media yesterday at the BOI office in Colombo.
He added that over 90 per cent of machineries and most of the buildings of the Kantale sugar factory are in a dilapidated condition and not in working order.
He said that the initial MoU regarding the investment was signed between the investor and the BOI and the secondary MoU was signed between the investor and the Treasury. Under these agreements, the government will have 51 per cent of shares while the investor will have 49 per cent of shares of the total project.
This is a real feasibility investment for the government, as the government will receive 51 per cent of shares free without making a monetary investment. It is significant that the ownership of the entire factory will be with the government after 30 years from the commencement of the project, the BOI Chairman said.
The BOI Chairmen noted that this proposal is a country-friendly project, through with both the country and the sugarcane cultivators will be benefited simultaneously. The farmers will be given a new verity of sugar cane plants which gives a better yield than the existing one,he added.

Would this be broken this year Highly unlikely. Lalith and Channa Gunaratna were two great brothers who played cricket for Ananda and also served the motherland by joining the army and the Air Force respectively while continuing their cricket careers.
Lalith played for Ananda from 1963 and captained the team in 1967, Channa played from 1969 to 1971. Both were punishing left-hand batsmen and were also left-arm seamers. Their father, Late Douglas Gunaratna who was attached to the Lake House in a managerial capacity was a frequent visitor to the cricket grounds to witness the performances of his sons. Most memorable performance of Lalith as captain was his leadership to beat the strong St. Benedicts outfit at Kotahena in 1967 by skittling the Bens for 22 runs in the second innings to end the match early on the second day.
In the same year on the 24th of January Lalith displayed his leadership qualities by beating a cock a hoop Thomian team, who thought they were unbeatable, the Thomians had a star studded team consisting of players such as David Ponniah, Ajith Jayasekera, Dennis Chanmugam, J.D.Bandaranayake ,P. L. D. Kariyawasamthese batsmen who had a copy book technique and the talent to match(these days called the software and the hardware) were utterly clueless against the wily spin of Lalith, who had a wide repertoire in his bowling armory such as orthodox spin, the arm ball which dipped in late, the chinamen and to cap it all he used the crease to good effect by using the width to fox the batsmen, I was a privy to all his bag of tricks because I used to stand at short slip.
The upshot to all this was Ananda won the match by 5 wickets by breaking a hoodoo. I must be thankful to Harischandra Gunaratna a Senior Journalist at The Island for giving me some details of the proceedings; then he was a 14 year oldboy studying at Ananda who watched this match.

Nearly 6,000 infants born with birth defects annually
Annually, around 6,000 infants are born with birth defects and it is the second leading cause for infant deaths (20 percent) in Sri Lanka. Around 2,000 infants are born in Sri Lanka annually with congenital heart diseases, Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J.M.W. Jayasundara Bandara said.
He said so while addressing a press conference held at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday. He said that some of the infants suffer from birth defects such as congenital heart diseases which could be cured through surgery, while President Maithripala Sirisena stated recently that he would provide the required funds for such surgeries.
The `Little Hearts projects which is now going on would be able to collect a part of the funds required for such surgeries.
According to Dr. Bandara, the human being is a complete and perfect creation of mother nature and if there is any type of defect in him, it is caused by nature due to the conflict between nature and human beings. As long as human beings live according to the system created by nature, he or she would not be affected by various diseases and health issues.
Meanwhile Consultant Community Physician Dr. Kapila Jayaratne ( MBBS, MSc, MD (Com.Med) said that only 5.6 percent of infants / children bellow the age of five die in Sri Lanka annually and only eight children out of every 1,000 die before celebrating their first birth day. Statistics are very satisfactory when compared with developed countries such as UK, where four children below the age of five die out of 1,000 every day.

Open invitation to bodu bala sena (BBS) : Economic prosperity through national reconciliation
[Part 3 ]
(International Law)
Part 1 and 2 were published in Daily News onFebruary 15th and 20th.
Attack is not a negative phenomenon, but, really positive. The negativity is coupled to it, when the attack is contaminated with ignorance rooted violence. The attack is a gift bestowed by the creator-God Himself. It contains a divine purpose. That is transformation into transcendence from the imperfection of impairment to improvement, from improvement to sophistication and from sophistication to perfection. Hence, any attack must be divine and for it to be divine, it should be intelligent and constructive. When the attack staggers in the reverse order, that is, from perfection to imperfection, from imperfection to de-sophistication, from de-sophistication to the defilement of destruction, it reaches the evil, beyond negativity.
Hence, the heavenly gift of attack is bestowed to man, to be used as a celestial tool of perfection. Yet, when it is blemished in to the disgrace of violence, assault and outrage, it gets locked in the orbit of impurity.
Empirical examples
The Islamic fundamentalist psychology imagined jihad doctrine and attacked Christians, killing thousands of them. Christians exerted the patience, believing in Christs Teaching on the Mount. Yet, when the jihad attack saw no end, the intelligent and rebellious French Pope, Urban the Second triggered the voice: Lets postpone the Commandment of Jesus, (When your one cheek is shot with a thundering slap, offer the other also), unite and destroy the Islamic jihadists. The whole Europe gathered, mustered the power of Christians and launched the Christian Crusade slaughtering millions of Jihadist Muslims and establishing the peace and freedom of Christians. No help descended down from the Jihadist God to fundamentalists. The Islamic Jihaad and Christian Crusade, both were destructive attacks.
Now the Buddha did not idle around. He also attacked. It, qualitatively, was a different attack. Buddha did not attack the believers of other religions, but his own self, its ego, its conceit, its false pride, its greed, hatred and delusion. He educated others too to do the same. The Buddhas attack was really positive, constructive, self-perfection-oriented. Nor did the Buddha blame others, nor exploited any phraseology to blame others. This is where the BBS can be powerful.
It has to learn the true attacking strategy, the Buddha used. That is to attack ones own mistakes, ignorance and flawed strategies. Such one attack was well elaborated in the Part 2 of the present text series: attack the barriers of the increase of the number of Sinhala Buddhist heads. The current article reveals the second attack: Fight to prosper the economy. No need to attack Muslims. When Sinhala Buddhists have right head numbers and right degree of the state of their economic prosperity that alone would castrate the strength and courage of any fundamentalism.
Unification into human-being
The true God created only human beings. Human-beings are God-made beings. Apart from God-made human-being, there are also man-made beings. Those are two types: (1) Social (2) Religious. Man-made social beings are Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims. Man-made religious-beings are Buddhists, Hindus and Islamists. These two types of man-made beings (religious and social) have proved only one thing. That is, they cant live in peace and harmony, though they, really can. Their record is five thousand wars within two thousand years of civilization.
The peace and harmony of Sri Lanka are in flames and now, the only solution lies in the immediate transformation of all man-made artificial social and religious beings, in to the transcendence of original God-beings, to be more precise, in to human-beings, sans, their fabricated and unnatural, social and religious distortions. In the void of such community unification, no peace, no harmony, no economic prosperity of Sri Lanka will be possible.
Sri Lanka already has had a painful experience with the terrorism of a tiny group of LTTE terrorists. Both parties lost and Tamils, with the presence of TamilNadu, lost even all what they previously had. This is what the small group of Muslim brothers, who have been and are at present being victimized in to the extremism of fundamentalism, should understand and grasp. Unity and nothing else. Hence, the Bodu Bala Sena must trigger the depth of this understanding and exhibit the maturity of their strategy structuring, to unify the Muslim youth community, being blemished and blindfolded in to the deception of fundamentalism, in order to blend them with the main stream of peace, friendship and cooperation, and enable the vibrant Muslim youth, to be converted in to a team of self-conscious rebels, who are ever ready to fight against the extremity of fundamentalism.
This proposed dutifulness to be in the unity of human-being, must be operative, not only on the part of Sinhala Buddhists, but also of Hindu Tamils and Islamic Muslims. The reciprocality is a sine qua non and the foundation of any economic prosperity.
Enemies of economic prosperity
Any developmental strategy of any country, particularly of the economic prosperity, has its own amplicity of enemies. Some of them are social. Others are religious. Social enemies are politicians and their self-centred and personal prosperity designs of selfishness, though, all politicians cannot be categorized in to this corrupt group. It is true there are few exceptions.
The political enmity of the developmental strategy comprises the heinous plunder of innocent peoples wealth, by way of the politicization of law and order, criminalization of politics, over-pricing of colossal project cost, unjust distribution of wealth, resulting in the enormous accumulation of it in the hands of a handful of people, unbearable cost of political administration, unfair taxing of people in order to compensate the surplus expenditure of political management, over-orientation to be in the dependence of the world market in order to play the commission game, reluctance to be perfect in the fertility of self-sufficiency, the stress of the focus on the projects of false-pride like, We built the tallest tower in South-east Asia, without resolving and satisfying the fundamental needs of the people, i.e. food, water, clothes, shelter and electricity and many more.
The religious antagonism which impedes the development is the proclaimed spiritual values, discouraging and murdering the developmental urge and ascribing to such values a self-imagined false societal respectability, declaring in which, that those who live according to such spiritual values are morally perfect in their character and they are holier than the others, who do not dwell by them.
Thus, if the BBS is interested in the social and religious stability of Buddhists, in the continued maintenance of the Doctrine of the Buddha, the economic steadiness of the Sinhala Buddhist is one component, the BBS must pay its central attention to.
Why Any community, pauperized in to lack of wealth, to impaired purchasing capacity, to starvation and to shelterlessness, would fall prey in to the power of the fist of the wealthy community and as a consequence, would lead a miserable life of dependency and political and social subordination, including compelled religious conversion. Without rightly understanding and addressing these issues, what is the point of blaming Muslims
Approach appropriateness of Muslims
Muslims are a community, the entire life of whom is governed by their religion Islam. In Islam, there is no ambiguity in the proclaimed spiritual principles in regard to the production of wealth. The inborn mental propensity of a sane-thinking man, for the attainment of material sophistication has not been cursed in to greed or sin.
On the contrary, it has been divinely encouraged. The death of man has not been reduced in to suffering, but, promoted as the real ground to live a life of celebration. The donation is recommended according to the proportions of ones own income. No renunciation and going from home to homelessness has been prescribed, as the path to be one with God all Mighty.
Naturally, they work hard, they produce voluminous wealth, they produce many children, via their Islamic discipline, and they are well united in the hour of need. There is an appreciable appropriateness in their approach. No need to blame them.
Sinhala Buddhist
This has to be understood in the context of inceptional understanding components, explained in the Part-1 of the current script series. The majority of Buddhist priests preach the lay community, what must be taught to the monks. They proclaim death, as suffering, life as impermanent, and the individual as non-self, causing pessimism and discourage in minds.
Further they teach, give what you have as Alms or Daana, renounce, love thy enemy, greed is an impurity and finally the people are advised to cause to cease the life. Now, how can the Sinhala Buddhist prosper economically Then, in the void of required head numbers, with no economic prosperity, without the military might, how can the Sinhala Buddhist survive Will the Buddhism last Read further and know the truth.
Celebration cause
Death is the real cause of authentic life celebration. The deathlessness would condition only boredom. The vanishing in to birthlessness will have only one result. That is, the disappearance of life. The life is eternal. Its end is not death. Death too is eternal. It does not die. Then, what does die It is the link that connects life and death, that dies. The Physicality is the link. Life is a beautiful deathless phenomenon, trekking along the path of evolution in to perfection. It is only after empirically perceiving the fertility of life, one must realize its futility. Until then, it is sheer ignorance and blind belief, foolishly believing in what others say. Buddha flatly refused blind belief.
BBS duty
Hence, the BBS has a duty. That is to precisely draw the line, between the Buddhist monk and the layman. It has to strengthen the lay man with the urge to produce his economic prosperity. It must make the Sinhala Buddhist envisioned, that only by living the rich fertility of life as a celebration, he can realize its futility and it is, not by destitution and wealthlessness, but by the amplicity of material opulence, the Doctrine of the Buddha can be retained in Sri Lanka and that is the only way to protect the Sinhala Buddhist and guard the Buddhas Dharma.
No point in blaming Muslims. If the lay Sinhala Buddhist is diminished in to a voluntary beggar, with the stretched-out hands with the begging bowl, perched on the palm, the nation can do only one thing. That is, to pray for the Lord Almighty God.
Blurb for continuation
The Islamic fundamentalist psychology imagined jihad doctrine and attacked Christians, killing thousands of them. Christians exerted the patience, believing in Christs Teaching on the Mount. Yet, when the jihad attack saw no end, the intelligent and rebellious French Pope, Urban the Second triggered the voice: Lets postpone the Commandment of Jesus, (When your one cheek is shot with a thundering slap, offer the other also), unite and destroy the Islamic jihadists. The whole Europe gathered, mustered the power of Christians and launched the Christian Crusade slaughtering millions of Jihadist Muslims and establishing the peace and freedom of Christians. No help descended down from the Jihadist God to fundamentalists. The Islamic Jihaad and Christian Crusade, both were destructive attacks.

Prosperity of development should reflect in peoples lives: President
Every government should give prominence for peoples essential requirements; food, housing, health and education. Low income families have to face many problems due to politicians who work for their private agendas without identifying matters of priority, said President Maithripala Sirisena.
The President vested the second phase of the Laksanda Sevana Housing complex in Salamulla, Kolonnawa in the public on Thursday. The housing complex consists of 396 houses.
The beauty we see in new roads and stunning high rise buildings should also be seen in the lives of the people. Though physical development pleases the eye, it is useless if its unable to beautify the lives of the people, he said.
The objective of the current government is to economically boost the people in the country.
The development of every sector has now been expedited.
The government will succeed in showing great progress in all sectors, including housing, urban development, agriculture, education and health, the President said.Some groups engage in protests with many allegations levelled against the government.
Even some media channels see only the bad side. I request them not to bring destruction to the country by over using their democratic freedom and rights, the president added.
The Laksada Sevana housing scheme costing Rs 1,188 million, will be given to 280 families in Sedawatta and Wadullawatta to those who were displaced due to the construction of the new Kelaniya bridge parallel to the old Kelaniya bridge.
The Laksada Sevana housing scheme was constructed parallel to the Divisuru Purawara which was implemented by the Urban Development Authority under the guidance of the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development to improve facilities in urban areas in the Colombo city with less facilities. Each house comprises 450 sq. ft. with a living room, two bedrooms, kitchen, balcony and sanitary facilities.
Expansion of the road system, construction of community centres and development of the infrastructure facilities will be completed parallel to the construction of this housing scheme.
The President opened the housing scheme by unveiling a plaque and inspected the Laksada Sevana housing scheme.
President Sirisena symbolically handed over the keys to several recipients of the houses marking the event. Ministers Patali Champika Ranawaka, Lakshman Kiriella, Arjuna Ranatunga, Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna and dignitaries including the Japanese Ambassador participated.

Resolving issues through new constitution
Addressing the 34th Session of the UN Human Rights Council, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera putting his diplomatic resources fully explained that presently the government expects to present the draft legislation on the Truth-Seeking Commission to the Cabinet shortly; within the next two months. Minister Samaraweera knew that he has to do the best and strengthen the position of his friend Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe; only person trusted by the Tamil middle class.
The minister explained in details the governments resolve to bring justice to the victims of human rights violations remains firm. He said the public consultations carried out by the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms were another important undertaking which was successfully concluded.
He was advised by various gurus on reconciliation to aim at the middle layers as against the extremist pro Tamil liberation lobby. However he was let down by Sumanthiran of Lanka's main Tamil party when he has asked the United Nations to put pressure on the Lankan government, to investigate and prosecute alleged war crimes committed during the country's 26-year war against Tamil Liberationists.
Reports of human rights abuses
The government agreed in 2015 to act on the reports of human rights abuses, but has done nothing since, M. A. Sumanthiran, MP and spokesman for Tamil National Alliance, said dismissing the stand of the government.
Further he said the government must be encouraged and made to accomplish every one of those undertakings that they agreed to. Sumanthiran made this statement at a Foreign Correspondents Association forum in Colombo. The U.N. accepted the left and democratic stand on this problem.
Human rights activists have accused the military of killing thousands of civilians, mostly Tamils, during the final weeks of the war and have urged justice for the families of those who disappeared.
But Maithripala/ Ranil government is struggling to implement the UN resolutions, which are politically unpopular among Sinhala middle class. President Maithripala Sirisena has backtracked on giving foreign judges a role in any investigation and prosecution. However the Commissions such as LLRC have proved that Lankan judiciary has not completely degenerated; hence just and fair investigations are possible with a pool of judges from all nationalities.
Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera speaking at the UN session in Geneva, said the government would form a truth-seeking commission to investigate conduct during the civil war.
Our resolve to see the transitional justice process through has not diminished, Samaraweera told the UN. In the mean time the British Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and Minister for Asia and the Pacific Alok Sharma said yesterday that Lanka should be given time to fully implement. He conveyed this while addressing the High-Level segment of the 34th Session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.
We must give Sri Lanka time to fully implement the October 2015 resolution and post-conflict measures required to embed stability, reconciliation and justice, he said. Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera has promptly met with Minister Sharma on the sidelines of the 34th Session of the UNHRC, and he had briefed Minister Sharma on recent developments with regard to the reconciliation process in Sri Lanka.
In Geneva, Lanka watchers have been talking about a recent interview with Chandrika Kumaratunga past president, currently the chairperson of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR).
National reconciliation
When a journalist asked former President Kumaratunga, where the country stands in terms of establishing national reconciliation she answered, It is successfully carried out. In the face of opposition and a handful of extremists, activities are continuing with the blessings of the majority.
Reconciliation means a lengthy activity. What is urgent now is to bring in a new constitution, and then comes the establishment of the Office of the Missing Persons. With these in place, there would not be any necessity to have courts to probe war crimes. This is an unacceptable statement for number of reasons.
The assertion that reconciliation is successfully carried out is an exaggeration to tell the least.
There cannot be total reconciliation without elimination discrimination and injustice and these are the roots causes of Lankas civil war  which was fought from 1983 to 2009 between Lankan government forces and the Liberation Tamil Tigers. Chandrika Kumaratungas claim that there would not be any necessity to have courts to probe war crimes is incorrect. Accountability for wartime abuses is a complicated and difficult issue; even the LLRC report indicates that.
However there is a substantial increase in consciousness among people, Sinhala people, about the grievances of the Tamil people. Land and Police powers should be given to the people of the Northern Province, said MP Athuraliye Rathana Thera recently.
Addressing the inaugural conference of the Sri Lanka National Council, he said that some MPs were constantly claiming to make a new Constitution to resolve the National issue -- which they define as Northern peoples land issues and Tamil speaking police in their areas. We, too, agree on giving land and police powers to the Northern community.

The Saints Quadrangular  sportsmanship at its best
Over 200 of the best athletes from the four Catholic schools that comprises the Saints Quadrangular namely St. Anthonys College Katugastota, established in 1854, St. Benedicts College Kotahena, established in 1865, St. Josephs College Darley Road, established in 1896, and St. Peters College Bambalapitiya, established in 1927 participated in the 2017 Saints Quadrangular held at St Peters College grounds on February 25 and 26.
The event hosted by St. Benedicts College with the active and energetic support of the management and leadership of the four schools and their old boys was a spectacular show where the four leading schools, came together with the spirit of camaraderie to compete with one another. Spirited and competitive athletes in the sprints, relay teams, jumping events and throwing events participated to show off their individual and team skills.
There were large numbers of old boys from the four schools cheering their athletes and participating in the old boys events.
Rectors, Rev Fr Henry Bernard Wijetunge of St. Anthonys College, Rev Fr Travis Gabriel of St Josephs College, Rev Fr Trevor Martin of St Peters College, and Rev Br Henry Dissanayake of St Benedicts College graced the occasion.
The Chief Guest of the event was Old Ben Luke de Silva, founder member of the Old Bens Alumni, New York, USA.
Athletics has always played a very important role in the history of the four schools and a great deal of prominence is given to nurture the sport and the track and field events.
The four schools continue to make significant investments to athletics with coaches, techniques, nutrition, equipment, and scholarships for promising athletes.
RESULTS
The highlight and the best performance of the meet, the Rev Br Alexander Cyrillus Memorial Challenge Trophy was awarded to Surinda Jayawickrama of St Josephs College for his U20, 100M sprint clocking 11.3sec.
The Mahesh Perera Challenge Trophy, Under 14 was awarded to St. Peters with 101 points followed by St Josephs with 89 points and St Benedicts with 44 points.
The W.B Bogahalanda Memorial Challenge Trophy, Under 16 was awarded to St Benedicts College with 122 points followed by St Josephs with 83 points and St Peters with 77 points.
The Hugh de Silva Challenge Trophy, Under 18 was awarded to St Benedicts College with 172 points followed by St Peters with 81 points and St Anthonys with 76 points.
The J. C. W Obeysekere Memorial Challenge Trophy, Under 20 was awarded to St Benedicts College with 116 points followed by St Peters with 113 points and St Josephs College with 63 points.

The Ranjith Weerasena runners up trophy was awarded to St Peters with 372 points and St Josephs College with 255 points.
The Quad is not only celebrated among present boys. Every year when the Quad is organized Old Boys too participate in several sports.
This same gesture was extended to the athletics meet as well and we witnessed a very spirited Old Boys representation in some events.
The Surgeon Commodore Samaranayake Memorial Trophy for the overall champions of the Old Boys events was won by St Peters College with 340 points and the Rev Fr Joe De Mel Memorial Challenge Trophy for the runners up was awarded to St Benedicts College with 266 points and St Anthonys College with 79 points.
HISTORY
The collective effort of the four schools in organizing this event is commended.
History tells us that the Quadrangular was mooted by the members of the Old Bens Sports Club.
We are informed that the invitation was extended to many schools to participate, but it was St. Anthonys, St Josephs and St. Peters that accepted the invitation.
Since then it has grown in stature, competition, and friendship.
The Saints Quadrangular goes back to 50 years of friendship and camaraderie where each school takes turn in hosting the event by playing cricket, basketball, soccer and rugby between the present boys and old boys.
The four schools are known to have produced some of Sri Lankas best sporting talent, some of whom have gone on to perform at the national and international stage in the fields of cricket, rugby, soccer, basketball, and hockey. Here are four leading Catholic schools coming together in the spirit of sports to nurture talent to represent their respective alma maters and the country.
The Saints Athletics Quadrangular was revived after a lapse of almost 25 years by St. Peters College in 2015 during which year St Benedicts College celebrated its sesquicentennial. The schools thank the Sri Lanka Athletics Federation officials, St. John Ambulance Cadet Services of St Benedicts College, sponsors and well-wishers, coaches, parents, and all participating athletes for a fabulous show.
St Anthonys College will host next years athletics meet in the cooler climes of Katugastota, Kandy.

Sex and relationships education to be made compulsory in England
The UK government on Thursday tabled amendments to the Children and Social Work Bill which will make it a requirement that all secondary schools in England teach relationships and sex education (RSE).
The amendments also permit the UK government to make regulations requiring personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE) to be taught in all schools in England - primary and secondary, maintained and academy - in future.
Relationships education, RSE, and PSHE are designed to ensure pupils are taught the knowledge and life skills they would need to stay safe and develop healthy and supportive relationships, particularly dealing with the challenges of growing up in an online world.
Currently only pupils attending local-authority run secondary schools - which represent around a third of secondary schools - are guaranteed to be offered current sex and relationships education, and PSHE is only mandatory at independent schools. Neither are currently required to be taught in academies.
The government is proposing the introduction of the new subject of relationships education in primary school and renaming the secondary school subject relationships and sex education, to emphasise the central importance of healthy relationships. The focus in primary school will be on building healthy relationships and staying safe.
As children grow older, it is important that they start to develop their understanding of healthy adult relationships in more depth, with sex education delivered in that context.
The statutory guidance for RSE was introduced in 2000 and is becoming increasingly outdated.
It fails to address risks to children which have grown in prevalence in recent years, including online pornography, sexting and staying safe online. As a result now is the right time to address these issues.

State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) Managing Director (MD) Dr. Rumie Mohamed said he had requested the CID, FCID etc to conduct immediate investigations on the accusations made by the Joint Opposition MPs against him. "I have instructed my lawyers to take legal action against the persons who assassinated my character and insulted me," he said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Ministry Auditorium in Colombo yesterday, he said he was a businessman and a strong supporter of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
"I became friends with him in November 2014 and supported him from the bottom of my heart as an individual who was victimized by the previous regime. I used my own vehicle for the election campaign of Minister Senaratne and he offered me the position of SPC MD in January 2015," he said.
"I was with Dr. Senaratne while he was receiving treatment in Singapore. I have developed the SPC to a higher level since I took over and ensured equal treatment to all employees," he said.
According to Dr. Mohamed, non of his family members or close relations are connected to the drug companies. "I have my own tea export company, computer company and a press.
I challenge the Joint opposition MPs to prove if any of my relations are connected to a drug company. All Mohameds' in the country are not my relations," he said.
"The drug company owner who slings mud at me is now trying to approach Minister Senaratne through me, but I prevented it. He tried to offer Rs. 5 million to the minister through me but I did not do it.
Minister Senaratne has never interferred with tender procedures. All including Government politicians attack Senaratne now because of his popularity," he added.

Sri Lanka: Slow progress on crucial justice and reconciliation  UN report :Stress laws for Hybrid Court
GENEVA (3 March 2017) The slow pace of transitional justice in Sri Lanka and the lack of a comprehensive strategy to address accountability for past crimes risk derailing the momentum towards lasting peace, reconciliation and stability, states a report issued by the UN Human Rights Office today.
The report acknowledges that there have been positive advances on human rights and constitutional reform. The Government has advanced on constitutional reforms and showcased some positive developments on the broader human rights agenda. The fulfilment of transitional justice commitments has, however, been worryingly slow, and the structures set up and measures taken during the period under review were inadequate to ensure real progress, the report states.
The report, which was mandated by the UN Human Rights Council to assess progress made in tackling the legacy of grave violations in Sri Lanka between 2002 and 2011, commends the constructive engagement of the Government of Sri Lanka with the UNs human rights bodies, marking a discernible change in policy. It also recognises some advances on crucial issues like land restitution and symbolic gestures towards reconciliation, as well as legal reforms and the design of an Office of Missing Persons. The laudable, inclusive work of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanism, appointed by the Government, has also resulted in an incisive report, which was issued in January this year.
However, the report by the UN Human Rights Office notes that the structures set up and measures taken until now have lacked coordination and a sense of urgency.
Party politics, including the balancing of power between the different constituencies of the coalition in the run-up to constitutional reforms, have contributed to a reluctance to address difficult issues regarding accountability or to clearly articulate a unified position by all parts of Government. Unclear and often contradictory messages have been delivered on transitional justice mechanisms. Public messaging around transitional justice and reconciliation has been generally confusing and at times contradictory, the report states.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein noted that in many ways, Sri Lanka appears to be turning a corner on the promotion and protection of human rights, but he stressed that hard-won gains could prove illusory if they are not tethered to a comprehensive, robust strategy.
Seventeen months ago, when we published a detailed report* on the grave human rights violations committed during the conflict in Sri Lanka, I urged the Government and all the people of Sri Lanka to ensure that this historic opportunity for truly fundamental change should not be squandered, High Commissioner Zeid said.
This critical opportunity in Sri Lankan history cannot be missed. I urge the Government and people of Sri Lanka to prioritize justice alongside reconciliation to ensure that the horrors of the past are firmly dealt with, never to recur.
The report makes a number of concrete recommendations, including calling on the Government to embrace the report of the Consultation Task Force, to formulate a communications campaign to inform the public about details of the reconciliation agenda, to invite the UN Human Rights Office to establish a presence in Sri Lanka, to give the highest priority to the restitution of all private land that has been occupied by the military, and to adopt legislation establishing a hybrid court.
The report also highlights a number of serious human rights violations that are reportedly continuing to occur in Sri Lanka, including the harassment or surveillance of human rights defenders and victims of violations, police abuse and excessive use of force, and the use of torture. The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka has stated that the complaints it receives indicate the routine use of torture by the police throughout the country as a means of interrogation and investigation. The report notes that the prevailing culture of impunity for perpetrating torture has undoubtedly contributed to this situation.
The authorities at all levels, from the Head of State to military, police, intelligence and local-level leaders, need to publicly issue unequivocal instructions to all branches of the military, intelligence and police forces that torture, sexual violence and other human rights violations are unequivocally prohibited and will be punished, Zeid said.
And such violations need to be promptly investigated without fail. This is essential to regain and retain the trust of all Sri Lankans in the authorities, and to reassure them that the State exists to protect the rights of all its people.
The High Commissioner will present the report to the Human Rights Council on March 22 in Geneva.

Sri Lankan SLNSS branch threatens TU action
The SriLankan Airlines Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya (SLNSS) branch said that they would resort to Trade Union action if they are not updated as to the latest developments on the sale of SriLankan Airlines and that they be given an appointment to meet President Maithripala Sirisena.
SLNSS president Janaka Wijayapathiratne told the Daily News that they want this meeting with the President because conflicting messages are being given by Ministers and top decision makers of SriLankan Airlines.
He said that the SriLankan Airlines Chairman says that he does not know anything about these developments.
Over 5,000 out of nearly 7,000 employees are our union members. They inquire from us as to what is happening about this alleged sale and we need to have the facts to answer them. In addition, though this government said transparency would be maintained during this deal, now it seems that there are a lot of under currents moving behind closed doors. We want to know the truth, Wijayapathiratne said.
He said that they had also wanted to meet the Prime Minister but this too had failed. We have now contacted the President through our mother Union Secretary Leslie Devendra and if an opportunity for a meeting is not granted to us before the end of March, we will launch a major strike at the airline.
The Colombo International Airport is now closed only in the day and if this trade union action goes ahead, it might cause a further shutdown in the airport from April,he said.
In March, it was announced that Sri Lanka was looking for foreign investors interested in taking over their beleaguered, debt-laden national carrier. In July, the government began taking offers for a 49% share and management control of the airline and three bidders, Peace Air, TPG and a Maldivian company were short listed.

State institutions duty bound to expedite investment projects: BoI Chairman
Board of Investment (BOI) Chairman Upul Jayasuriya noted that all state institutions are duty bound to take prompt measures to expedite investment projects, especially those carried out with foreign funds.
He said so when questioned by the media as to the cause for the delay in commencing the project proposal relating to the Kantale Sugar factory received in 2015. It is revealed that the MoU in this regard was signed in July 2015, but the project could not get off the ground as it did not receive due approval from the relevant state institutions.
Besides, the land has not yet been released by the Agriculture Ministry to the investor despite several requests.
At this juncture, the Chairman noted that relevant state institutions should take prompt measures to expedite the commencement of the investments.Moreover, the delay de-motivates investors, Jayasuriya said.
Sometimes, there are certain infrastructure related issues concerning electricity, Local Government bodies, obtaining environment approval etc, the BoI Chairman attributed as being the causes for various delays.

Sugar manufacturing industry records historic profits
The state owned sugar manufacturing industry reported historic profits, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said in Buttala on Thursday.
Minister Bathiudeen was addressing the inaugural event of the sugar cane harvesting ceremony of Pelawatte Sugar Industries owned by the Lanka Sugar Company (Private) Limited (LSCL). We start another round of sugarcane harvesting. For years, similar harvesting ceremonies have been taking place, but local sugar production was incurring losses and likelihood of privatisation has been in the air, Minister Bathiudeen said.
The government owned sugar production industry is earning profits without any need for privatisation, he said.
Over 11,000 workers under LSCL, have together helped transform losses to equal levels of massive profits in a year, he said.
"We are producing less than 10 percent of our annual sugar needs locally. We need to increase this. Meanwhile, Maximum Retail Prices (MRP) on sugar sales are not helping our sugar development efforts, the minister said.
Sri Lanka consumes 500,000 MT sugar, but locally productions is only 8 percent, he said.

Tamil National Alliance welcomes report: Implementation of 2015 HRC resolutions, recommendations
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) welcomes the report of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on the implementation of the 2015 Human Rights Council resolution and its recommendations.
While the report acknowledges some areas of progress, such as discussions on Constitutional reform, it is critical of the governments failure to deliver with respect to a number of critical issues. The TNA shares the concerns of the Report that confidence building measures such as land releases, release of prisoners, repeal of the PTA, reform of the Victim and Witness Protection Authority and ending military involvement in commercial and civilian activities have not been pursued satisfactorily. In fact, the failure of the government on these issues are steadily eroding the trust of our people.
We have continued to express our concern about the lack of progress on the issue of accountability and have called on the government to present a time-bound action plan to implement its own commitments. The systemic failure to make progress on emblematic cases in the regular courts, highlights the need for a special court with robust international participation in keeping with the governments commitments.
We welcome the High Commissioners recommendation echoing this demand. We also call on the government to operationalize the Office on Missing Persons forthwith. The inexplicable delay in doing so, unconscionably prolongs the agony of the families of the disappeared.
We therefore welcome the High Commissioners call that the Human Rights Council sustain its close engagement with the Government of Sri Lanka and ensure the monitoring of developments in the country.
We call on the Government to demonstrate good faith by making swift progress on the issues highlighted by the High Commissioner.

## Title: A timely call

A timely call
President Maithripala Sirisena has publicly turned down an invitation to open the new super prison built at Angunakolapelessa, saying we should strive to create a society where prisons can be closed and more schools opened.
Speaking at a function held at the St. Marys College in Kegalle, President Sirisena said even though he had received an invitation to declare the facility open, he declined it because rather than opening a prison it was worth opening a school, which would provide education to children. We should build a country which opens schools and closes prisons. We should also build a country where people are healthy, and the number of hospitals minimized, he added.
This is indeed a bold and timely statement, coming at a time when organised crime has raised its ugly head, as seen in the carnage at Kalutara where five suspects and two prison officials were gunned down. As the President alludes, there is a distinct and direct link between education and good conduct.
Aruna Udayashantha alias Ranale Samayan, the underworld leader who was the main target of the Kalutara attackers was a social misfit who had stayed away from school after O/Ls and ended up in the company of like-minded outcasts. Samayans story is generally applicable to most criminals  a truncated education, bad company and a dive into crime that can also end in death. Samayan was only 37 when he was killed.
Education has a major role to play in moulding good citizens. The inculcation of moral values in children must begin at home. Parents must keep a close eye on their children and guide them on the correct path. Unlike in the days gone by, todays children have access to the Internet and other new media which could sometimes have a corrupting influence on the growing mind.
Schools and places of worship are the next most important components in the fight against crime. School and religious school teachers should play a greater role in imparting moral values on the younger generation. Indeed, many experts say that distancing ourselves from places of worship has become a major cause for the moral decay seen in contemporary society. In earlier times, there was a tight bond between places of worship and the village, which is no longer the case now. In this context, the Governments emphasis on religious education and the requirement of mandatory education for 13 school years are praiseworthy.
It is also vital to address one other shortcoming in our education system  thousands of students are left out at O/L and A/L stages without any recourse to higher education. Many students, as exemplified by the case of Samayan, take to the streets and a life of crime afterwards. This situation must be rectified without delay.
The availability of more educational and employment opportunities will veer children away from unsavoury activities. As an aside, it will also change the present three wheeler culture where children buy three wheelers just after their studies and enter an unproductive life. Incidentally, three wheelers are also used to commit many serious crimes.
There is also a clear nexus between drugs and crime. Peddling and using drugs itself is a crime, but those who are addicted to narcotics usually take to petty and even organised crime to fuel their addictive habit. The Government has taken many steps to stem the flow of illegal narcotics, but more needs to done. The eradication of the drug menace will go a long way towards creating a crime-free society. The alleviation of poverty is another pillar in the fight against crime, along with education for all.
The President raised a moot point when he suggested that prisons should be closed, because most countries now employ other means of punishing wrongdoers. Community service is one such method which is rarely used here. That gives the wrongdoer a sense of belonging to the wider society. Indeed, most of those who engage in a life of crime have a grudge against the society for neglecting them. Hence, their anti-social activities.
As the President said at the school event, good people in society must come forward to set the society on the correct path. Their silence could cost the society heavily. He recalled the statement of Martin Luther King: The greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamour of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people. He said intellectuals and great personalities should work more to suppress the strident clamour of bad people.
That is a major challenge that lies ahead of us. Religious dignitaries and intellectuals should come forward to set on the correct path a society that is now consumed by an all-out desire for money at all costs. The relentless pursuit of monetary and material gains at the expense of everything else, sometimes including life itself, is tearing apart the very fabric that binds our society together. Urgent action must be taken to stem this rot before it is too late.

Treasury Bond issue: Tender Board, Public Debt Dept. diasagreed with former CB Governors decision making
The Tender Board and the Public Debt Department was not in agreement with the decision making of the former CBSL Governor Arjun Mahendran regarding the questioned Treasury bond issuance on February 27, 2015,the CBSL Additional Director of the Statistics Department Dr.M.Z. Asim said.
The Tender Board was reluctant but compelled to comply with the former CBSL Governors decision to accept 10.5 billion bids at the said auction, Dr. Asim further said.
Dr. Asim, who was one of the then Additional Superintendents of the Public Debt (ASPD) during 2015, was testifying at the Presidential Commission to investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds yesterday.
The Public Debt Department, Asim said, recommended the former CBSL Governor and the Tender Board to accept 2.6 million biddings at the questioned auction, for which they prepared the auction sheet.
But the former CBSL Governor along with the two Deputy Governors visited the PDD for the second time around 12.30 p.m. Myself, ASPD Muthugala, S.P.D.Seneviratne and the Head of the Front Office were just outside my office. Asim explained.
Then, the Governor requested the Superintendent of the Dept Department, Seneviratne for the second time in the day on the auction details to which she said there are 20 plus bids made at the questioned auction.
Asked on how the conversation then proceeded, Asim went on to explain that the former CBSL Governor told S.D.P. Seneviratne to accept all 20 plus bids.
I immediately reacted to this. I pointed out to the former CBSL Governor, if we accept all 20 plus bids, the interest rates will go high. Asim said.
SPD Seneviratne also held the same opinion that I did, Asim said.
Despite my confrontation, the former CBSL Governor took the bid sheet room to examine its content, he further said.
The Commission questioned does that mean Mahendran was able to see the names of the Primary Dealers who had made bidding, to which Asim replied that it may have been the case.
When asked if he did not confront the two Deputy Governors who were present at the discussion, Asim replied he did indeed, but they remained silent about the issue raised.
It was at this moment, the former CBSL Governor mentioned that this would be the time the bid placing that can move away from direct placement method. Asim said.
With the decision given by the former CBSL Governor to accept 10.5 billion bids at the auction, the PDD had to prepare a second auction sheet complying with the new decision, Asim pointed out.
The Presidential Commission then pointed out that it seems neither any COPE committees or the Auditor Generals examination on the same matter, have not examined the second auction sheet. Asim confirmed that there is a second auction sheet, the original copy can be derived from the documents of the Public Debt Department.
Asked whether the Tender Board confronted the second auction sheet, Asim said to his view all the members of the Tender Board immediately started to express their concerns over the matter and demanded to clarify the decision with the Governor Mahendran himself.
Asked if the Chairman of the Tender Board held the same view, Asim said it was the case and Seneviratne also said to the Tender Board that he wants to get the decision clarify with the CBSL Governor Mahendran himself.
Firstly, Samarasiri attempted to inquire on this from the former Governor via telephone, but, was unable to reach him. Then, he went outside the conference room where the Tender Board meeting was held, and came back in after about 45 minutes. He had contacted the former Governor via his office telephone, Asim explained.
After the Tender Board Chairman Samarasiri came back in, he said the governor had provided three points on the rationalisation on the questioned decision making.
The three points were, tight financing requirements of the government, prevailing high liquidation and the structure of interest rate,  Asim said.
Asked on as to why as the secretary to the Tender Board, he did not keep a minute on the Tender Board members, Asim said the minute keeping was dictated by the Chairman of the Tender Board and that he was not able to do so.
Asked if the former CBSL Governors direction to raise a 40 billion through issuance of 20. 30 and 40 years Treasury Bonds was an order, Asim said he cannot say so and the direction was forwarded as a request to push the treasury bonds to a longer tenure. He also said however, any extension of maturity period of a treasury bond is usually always discussed extensively in the Tender Board.
Meanwhile, the legal representative of Tender Board Chairman Attorney Harsha Fernando pointed out to the Presidential Commission, if the former Governor had instructed to opt for auction method, why had the CBSL raised 3.5 million on the same day,February 27, 2015, using the direct placement method.
Fernando pointed out, if it is really the case where Treasury Bond issuance method that has stemmed the doubts regarding the auction.
The Presidential Commission is to summon the former SDP Seneviratne on February 6 for inquiry.

Ven. Rathana Thera to remain an independent MP
Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said he had no intention of joining any political party in the future.
The Thera made the decision to sit as an independent MP in Parliament recently.
I have not decided on any political party and I have no political ambitions at present. I want to build a wide national movement which will bring together different groups under one platform,said the Thera, who at present has taken on the leadership of the National Council of Sri Lanka (NCSL).
The MP who is part of the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) was elected to Parliament through the National List slot of the United National Front. The JHU has insisted that Rathana Thera cannot function as an independent MP and asked that he resign from the party and give up his seat to former JHU Western Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe. The party has also alleged that the Thera intended to join the UNP in the near future.
The Thera however has refused to resign and denied such allegations. He instead said he would stick by the government and concentrate on the NCSL to pressure the government to agree on a National Planning Commission in the next three years, What we need right is government policy and a wider movement can achieve that more effectively than a political party which is limited to certain boundaries,the Thera said.
This is not the first time the Thera has started a mass movement. Since his entry into politics as a student activist at university, the outspoken monk has been part of forming such organisations like: Janatha Mithuro, Ratawesi Peramuna, the National Movement Against Terrorism, Sihala Urumaya, Jathika Hela Urumaya and the Pivithuru Hetak Movement.
When asked whether he planned to quit politics altogether, the Thera replied, I Will decide what to do after three years.

83rd Battle of the Saints : Jehan Daniel (124 n.o.) is Joes saviour
Sri Lanka under 19 cricketer Jehan Daniel played the role of savior to rescue St Josephs College from dire straits at 10 for 5 to a respectable 205 on the opening day of the 83rd Battle of the Saints encounter against St Peters College at the P Sara Oval yesterday.
By the close the game was evenly poised with St Peters replying with 138 for five wickets.
Daniels magnificent century saved St. Josephs the blushes and enabled them to take the upper hand.
Daniel came to the crease with his side tottering at 10 for 5 after skipper Harin Cooray had won the toss and elected to bat first. However in the first sessions play things go the way the Joes would have planned.
Under 19 player cum Peterite vice-captain and right arm fast bowler Manelker de Silva and his new ball partner Santhush Gunathilake combined together to rip through the batting line up.
Gunathilake ran through the Joes top order by making the early breakthrough in his first two overs when he dismissed openers Cameron Duruge and took the prize wicket of Nipun Sumanasinghe who has scored 1000 runs this season.
Manelker De Silva added salt to the wound of the Josephians when he got rid of Dineth Madurawela for one as St. Josephs slid to 3 for 3.
To make matters worse for the Joes both Thashan Perera and Havin Perera were run out due to brilliant fielding and half the Joes side was out for 10.
A sixth wicket partnership of 56 between Daniel and wicket keeper Shevan Fonseka (26) addressed the slump. The stand was ended with another run out of Fonseka following a direct throw from Ranmith Jayasena, son of Panadura SC cricketer Mangala Jayasena.
Daniel and Jehan Fernandopulle son of former Benedictine cricketer Marlon Fernandopulle took the score to 95 before Jehan was run out for 14 by Manelker de Silvas brilliant fielding.
Daniel counter attacked making use of three dropped chances to score an unbeaten 124 off 116 balls that included 12 boundaries and five sixes. He was involved in a face saving partnership of 93 runs for the eighth wicket with left hander Pahan Perera (25) that saw St. Josephs to their final total.
The eighth wicket partnership between the pair broke a 67-year old record for St. Josephs of 66 between Adolphus Silva and Milroy Brohier in 1950.
For the Peterites who batted after tea Shalith Fernando their number four batsman hit a fine 47 before being dismissed in the penultimate over of the day. However vice-captain Manelker de Silva hung around for a solid unbeaten 40 by the close.

88th Battle of the Maroons: Ananda confident of win over Nalanda
Ananda College captain Kavishka Anjula expressed confidence that he had a team that can beat their arch rivals Nalanda College in the 88th Battle of the Maroons cricket encounter which commences at the SSC grounds today. The two teams are vying for the P de S Kularatne Memorial Trophy.
Our team had good preparation for the big match. We have a good bowling attack and a strong batting line too. We are ahead of the Nalandians and hope to win this encounter, said Ananda skipper Kavishka Anjula.
Ananda coach Rohan Soysa also going along with his captain stated, We played well this season and our batsmen are in good form with a lot of runs behind them. We have good spinners and fast bowlers and we know a thing or two about our opponents. We have planned to go for an outright win over.
Nalanda were a bit more cautious with their chances of winning. Skipper Dasun Seneviratne said, I think both schools have well balanced teams. But Shammu, Kavishka and Sahan are good players and thats why I think it is a big challenge for us. We have a good bowling squad to face that challenge. We also have stylish batsmen like Malinga and Lakshitha and, Umeksha and Kalana will give their fullest support to our team.
Nalanda coach Keerthi Gunaratne said, We have good bowling attack and our bowlers will control the game. The Anandians have a good batting line but I think their bowling is weak. We can see a very tough game on the cards.
These two schools started their big match series in 1924. R.S. Rajakaruna (Ananda College) and B.S. Perera (Nalanda College) were the captains of those teams. The game was ended in a draw. The first win of the Maroons Battle was recorded by the Nalandians in 1925 under B.S. Perera and when N.M. Perera was the Ananda captain. For the next two consecutive years Ananda beat Nalanda under the captaincy of W.W. Dep.
In the history of the Battle of the Maroons Ananda has won 12 times in 1926, 1927, 1930, 1932, 1934, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1941, 1965, 1982 and 2003 and Nalanda six times in 1925, 1928, 1947, 1949, 1950 and 1953. The last Ananda victory was under Duminda Kularatne in 2003 while Nalanda have not tasted victory for the past 64 years their last win coming in 1953 under W. Wimalaratne Silva.
Ananda established a record for the most consecutive victories in the history of the encounter by winning the Big Match during the years 1937, 1938 and 1939. The match was not played in 1943, 1944 and 1945 due to the Second World War. The Maroons encounter was also not played in 1948, the year in which Sri Lanka gained independence.
This season both Ananda and Nalanda have recorded five outright wins. Ananda against St. Josephs, Trinity, St. Benedicts, Wesley and Dharmapala Pannipitiya and Nalanda against Mahanama, Prince of Wales, Dharmpala Pannipitiya, St. Marys Kegalle and Maliyadeva Kurunegala. It seems that two evenly balanced teams will clash with each other at this years edition of the Maroons.

All-round sportsman Hyasti Aponso of Prince of Wales
Hyasti Aponso brought fame and glory to Prince of Wales not only as a cricketer and a past captain but also in other fields of sports like athletics, football and table tennis. Our Moratuwa Correspondent Dilwin Mendis managed to track down Hyasti at his residence in Kaldemulla Moratuwa for an interview ahead of the Prince of Wales- St Sebastians Big Match that takes place next Friday and Saturday.
Q: What is your full name and date of birth
HA: Hyasti Rakshonda Aponso, 4th January 1943
Q: Which year did you enter college and who was your first teacher
HA: In 1947 to the Lower Kindergarten (Babies Class) and my first teacher was Mrs. Dorris Mendis.
Q: What made you take to cricket
HA: From my boyhood days I had been very interested in cricket and in our neighbourhood I always played softball cricket with my friends.
At school too I watched our senior boys playing softball cricket and I too played with my class mates. One day our Lower School Head Master later Member of Parliament for Horana Sagara Palansuriya called me and asked me to come for under 12 cricket practices in 1953. So I attended practice and my first coach was at that time a first eleven senior cricketer Stanley de Alwis, who later went on to play for All-Ceylon. One day our former stalwart H. I. Fernando came to the ground and saw my close in fielding and told Stanley to give the wicket-keeping job to me. Since then throughout my career I was a wicket-keeper.
Q: You have opened batting also
HA: At the beginning I went lower down and then came up to the middle order and later I opened batting until the end of my career.
Q: What happened after that
HA: In 1953 I was selected for the under 12 cricket team under Senerath Rodrigo and we played only one friendly match against Royal College. During this period there was no tournament cricket. The following year I played under Sunil de Silva in the under 14 cricket team and in 1955 I was captain and we beat Ananda, Nalanda, Zahira, Sebs and drew with Royal. Next year I played in the under 16 team under Sunil and in 1956 I captained the team.
Q: Were you called for First Eleven cricket practice
HA: Yes, that was in 1958/59 season under Suranjith Mendis. I played a few matches on and off and I was the reserve wicket keeper to Earl Fernando. In 1959 we won the Big Match.
Q: After that what happened
HA: Under W. G. Fernando I was a unanimous choice for the first eleven team in 1959/60 and I opened the batting with Sunil and kept wickets. In the 1960 big match I scored 47 runs and put on a 97 runs partnership. Sunil and W. G. scored unbeaten 132 each and put on a second wicket partnership of 247 runs. That match was drawn. That year one of our distinguished and a very loyal old boys Aelian Peiris started the Big Match souvenir and in the following year our advanced level students including myself carried on and in 1964 we handed it over to another distinguished and very loyal old boy and teacher of our college Dunstan Perera. Since then I am very happy that the OBA has been doing this tedious task. In 1960/61 series I played under Roy Cooray and passed the 500-run mark. That year the big match was drawn. Instead of Roy, Lister Perera captained the big match.
Q: What was your last year in school
HA: 1962. In 1961 and 1962 seasons I captained the college team and we beat Royal, Wesley, Richmond and we got the better of most schools including S Thomas. I scored centuries against Royal, Kingswood and Richmond. But unfortunately we lost to St. Sebastian's. That season too I passed the 500-run mark.
Q: How did you lose the big match with such a star studded team
HA: Both teams were well balanced and we played at Sebs grounds and in the first term Merl, Rajah and K. D. C. left school. Even then our side was good with Hemal (Snr), Munasinghe, Vernon, D. S. and Sarath de Silva and our star batsman who was in fine form was Ryle de Mel. Sebs was led by my good friend Priyantha Fernando and he had in the ranks Sumithra, Rex, Frank, Sunimal and speedster Nihal. It was a low scoring game. The main reason for losing the match was we expected a lot from Ryle. But unfortunately he was a failure in both innings. Hemal and myself got 80's but it was insufficient. I do not want to give lame excuses for a well deserved victory by our friendly rivals. It amply proves that cricket is a game of glorious uncertainties.
Q: What are the other sports you played
HA: I got colours for cricket, football, athletics and table tennis and I played for the junior and senior tournaments. It helped me to get the eye while batting. I was the goalie of the football team and we beat our arch rivals Sebs in the big match. I won the Discus event and was a member of the school 4 x 440 yards relay team. I represented the College at the Western Group Meet and after winning I represented the public schools in the same events. I was a Junior Cadet for three years in 1956/57/58. We won the De Soysa Squad Drill Challenge Trophy in 1958. Since then we have not won this trophy. I was a senior cadet from 1959 to 1961 and in that year we won the Commandants Cup. We won several awards in other events too.
Q: You got a first division at the Senior School Certificate Examination in 1958
HA: Yes. I did my HSC but I could not enter the Medical College. From school I joined the Central Bank and after some time I got an appointment at the Tyre Corporation and I was sent to Russia then Soviet Union on a scholarship for 1 1/2 years. There was no cricket in Russia. I did a little skiing and skating. After leaving school I played for Moratuwa Sports Club prior to leaving to the Soviet Union. After returning I played for Moratuwa SC and captained them in 1965. I also played for the Tyre Corporation in all divisions and was selected to play for the Nationalised Services team for several years. One of my team mates was former Thomian cricketer and our teacher D. S. Samuel.
Q: After leaving the corporation were you involved in anything
HA: No. At present I am leading a retired life but I am not in good health. I am always following the college affairs because that is the place where I was moulded.
Q: You were in Australia in the recent past
HA: Yes, both myself and my wife visited Melbourne to see our daughter and came back on 7th February 2017. My son is living with us.
Q: What is the advice you can give to our young Cambrian cricketers
HA: I would like to advice the up and coming young cricketers to concentrate on the game by practicing hard and playing the game with devotion and dedication but within the rules. At the same time class room work should not be neglected at any cost as in this competitive world. You cannot get anywhere in life unless you are extremely talented and get to the top. God bless Prince of Wales' College and all the Cambrians young and old. Also wishing all the best to the two teams who are involved in the 2017 big match.

With the commencement of the public auction through the primary dealers in Treasury bonds, the price and volumeof Treasury bonds were determined through market forces. Therefore the related Gazette notifications were issued after the Treasury bond issuances, but on dates and Gazette numbers which were pre-reserved. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has taken the following measures to comply with the intent of the law.
a) Total borrowing during a particular year is maintained within the limit approved by the Parliament of Sri Lanka under the Appropriation Act for each financial year.
b) Based on the information provided by the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka publishes in national newspapers in all three languages and in its website, all information including the amount to be raised through issuance of Treasury bonds, coupon rate, the auction date, settlement date and the maturities.
c) The results of the auction are disseminated immediately after each auction, for the information of the general public through the website of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
In addition to the issuance of new series of Treasury bonds, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka also re-opens the existing series of Treasury bonds already issued in the past and issues them on the basis of remaining maturity in line with best international debt management practices. Therefore, the gazette notification in any given year includes references to T-bonds which are newly issued as well as re-opened during the financial year concerned.
Accordingly, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka reiterates the view that it has been in compliance with the intent of the said provisions of RSSO.
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka assures the general public that the Treasury bonds issued on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka have full legal authority and effect.
In addition the Central Bank of Sri Lanka will be making recommendations to the Government on suitable amendments to the RSSO.

Chandimal returns to form in timely fashion with unbeaten 190
Sri Lanka vice-captain and middle-order batsman Dinesh Chandimal returned to form in timely fashion with a magnificent knock of 190 not out off 253 balls for Sri Lanka Presidents XI in the two-day warm-up match against the touring Bangladesh side which ended in a draw at De Soysa Stadium Moratuwa yesterday.
Sri Lanka Board XI replying to Bangladeshs first innings total of 391 for 7 declared finished on 403 for seven wickets with Chandimals monumental knock making up for most of the total.
Chandimal captaining the side displayed responsibility and maturity as he steered his side towards an honourable draw with an innings that would have given him immense confidence ahead of the first Test against Bangladesh starting at Galle Tuesday next.
The exciting right-hander was dropped from the side following a poor run in South Africa where in 12 international innings his highest score was 36 and was told by chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya that he should go back to club cricket and work out his game.
Chandimal was however named in the squad for the two Tests against Bangladesh and having been given the opportunity to enhance his chances in the Test eleven further and regain his lost form, he was asked to lead the Sri Lanka Presidents XI in the warm-up game against Bangladesh. He has responded in magnificent fashion rising up to the challenge stroking 21 fours and seven sixes in an innings that would give immense confidence to the wobbly Sri Lankan middle order for the Test series. Chandimals innings came on the back of him having kept wickets the entire first day when Bangladesh batted. He had only a brief rest the following day because the SL Board XI lost their first two wickets by the fifth over.
The local team were 29 for three before four half century partnerships involving Chandimal with Roshane Silva (38), Rumesh Buddhika (32), Leo Fransisco (27) and Wanidu Hasaranga (32) and an unbroken century stand of 112 for the eighth wicket with Chamila Karunaratne (50 n.o.) lifted the SL Board XI and helped them gain control of the Bangladesh bowling.
The pick of the bowlers for the visitors were Mustafizur Rahman and Taskin Ahmed who took five wickets between them.

Coconut cultivation boosted in Apura
Coconut cultivation is in progress in the Anuradhapura district.
Coconut Cultivation Board Anuradhapura Regional Manager W.M.S.W. Bandara said the acreage of coconut in the district has expanded by 16,000 acres during the last few years.
He said the acreage of 36,000 a few years ago has increased up to 52,000 acres. The Regional Manager said coconut will be grown in minimum 500 acres in every year to achieve the target of 100,000 acres of coconut in the Anuradhapura district by 2020. Bandara said DC mill owners and vegetable oil businessmen were the deciding factor of coconut prices in the market. The trend will be changed for the benefit of consumers, he said. The Regional Manager said a programme to provide water supply systems to small scale plantations is underway. Dolomite is introduced to coconut lands to avoid the scarcity of magnesium and keep the wetness in the soil, he said.
A programme is promoted to enhance the coconut harvest. Small scale plantations below 2 1/2 acres are issued fertilizer subsidy. The "Kapruka" micro interest loan facility scheme is implemented in addition to "Kaprukai - Parapurai" project to encourage farmers, Bandara said.
Coconut plants are provided to parents free on behalf of a newly born child under the "Kaprukai - Parapurai" project.
"We have taken steps to prevent mite and red beetle menace from spreading in coconut plantations in 22 Divisional Secretariat division level. We suffer from lack of staff, he said.
Bandara said Rs. 25 million has been allocated for coconut development activities for 2017 in addition to Rs. 34 million to provide fertilizer subsidy for small holdings.

Cricketer Asoka Wijeratne to wear Baggy Green
Sri Lankan Asoka Wijeratne has been selected by the Board of Veterans, Cricket Australia for the 0ver 60s team that is due to tour the UK in July this year.
The selection will give him the chance to wear the Baggy Green cap and his selection to the squad of 17 was from 30 nominations that were received.
Asokas dad Tiddy now in his 90s is a legend in Canberra. Although physically a little frail, but alert fully mentally, and played quite a bit of cricket himself in Australia since migrating in the 70s.
Asoka had his formal education at Mahinda College Galle and later at Ananda College where he played in the under 16 cricket team before migrating to Australia in 1971.
He attended High School in Sydney and entered University of NSW (UNSW) to undertake a degree in Chemical Engineering which also enabled him to play cricket for UNSW from 1974 to 1983. He played in the 1st Grade team that won the championship akin to the Sara Trophy championship in Sri Lanka.
At the time Australian Test cricketers like Lawson, Whitney, Turner, Benaud (John), Chappell (Trevor) and Dyson played 1st Grade cricket regularly.
After graduating Asoka has been in the water industry in Sydney and Canberra. After 10 years or so in the workforce in Sydney he moved to Canberra in 1988. In 2004 he was appointed General Manager Water at ActewAGL  a public private partnership. He left full time work in 2013 and since has been doing part time work including consultancy in Canberra and outside and playing cricket.
I must say cricket has been very good to me. When we arrived in 1971 - Australia was in the process of dismantling the White Australia policy, playing cricket made it a lot easier to get into the swing of things, said Asoka who lives with his wife and baby boy.
I even managed to get holiday work when I was at University due to meeting people I played cricket against. This sort of experience has led me to believe that people whatever colour, creed etc. on the whole are good - of course there are the bad apples, he said.

Dealing with countrys post war issues: NO HYBRID COURT: PM
Proposes Truth and Reconciliation Commission:
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday ruled out the possibility of a hybrid court stating it was not politically feasible.
Instead the Prime Minister proposed a Truth and Reconciliation Commission(TRC) as the best option to deal with post war issues of the country.
The Premier was addressing the ceremonial inauguration of National Law Week 2017 at the auditorium of Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL).
Wickremesinghe observing that the establishment of a hybrid supreme court may require a referendum, said he raised this point with the UN Human Rights High Commissioner as well.
Can you actually establish a hybrid supreme court If you bring in an Amendment for that purpose, is the two thirds majority of Parliament sufficient What if the court decides that it requires a referendum he questioned.
The European Union (EU) itself knows the dangers of a referendum, the Premier added referring to the much talked-about EU referendum which paved way for Brexit.
We will have to seriously rethink it. If the court rules that we must go for a referendum we will end up in serious trouble. Hybrid court is surely not something we can campaign for. It is certainly not practical. We are now looking at a new mechanism, the Premier said.
The Office of Missing Persons (OMP) has already been set up and a Special Counsel to be appointed. We are now considering a TRC which I think can resolve many issues. The South African experience, the strengths and weaknesses of that process, will be studied. Generally all parties are in agreement with it in principle, the Prime Minister pointed out.
The Prime Minister pointed out the TRC would be a cornerstone of achieving reconciliation, but at the same time stressed that a basic agreement on new Constitution is needed for the setting up of TRC. He pointed out the extremists on both sides of the divide would reject the TRC, adding that the Centre would have to deal with that.
Any criminal procedure cannot be long drawn. It has to be fast. We have fought too long. We have to find a quick way to compensate for those suffered and met with injustice. We have to address the issue of missing persons, the Prime Minister commented.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, reminding the debt the country has to repay in the next 10 years, noted the importance of thinking of a mechanism to ensure that the country meets the expectations of the international community, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Referring to the ongoing UNHRC sessions in Geneva, the Prime Minister said the Sri Lankan Government is negotiating a roll over in the next two years with regard to undertakings mentioned in 2015 Resolution.
The reference to a Hybrid Court was because the people lacked faith in the local judicial system, but over the past two years we have restored peoples faith by upholding independence and integrity of court. The smooth transition of Chief Justices was an example. Last week the Constitutional Council and the President worked together for this purpose, the Prime Minister added. The Premier also used the opportunity to congratulate newly appointed Chief Justice Piyasath Dep, who was also at the head table making his first formal appearance as the CJ, commending him as a person who deserves the position of that high rank.
The Premier stressing that the independence of the judiciary should not be compromised in anyway, observed that the countrys court system is older than the political system and that most of the members of the first Legislative Council were lawyers.
The Premier said the Government is now negotiating with the European Union to regain the GSP plus facility, and observed this trade concession was given based on good governance practices. We lost it because there were questions over the independence of judiciary, media freedom and independence of election system over the past years. Last two years we have been able to re-negotiate to regain this concession, the Prime Minister said.
Now we have to ensure that our laws are compliance with international standards and international human rights practices the Premier noted.
The Premier also took the opportunity to reiterate his stance over the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and its Optional Protocol to which Sri Lanka is a signatory party. Previously, I raised the same in Parliament and asked the Speaker to give a ruling. The Singarasa case was a departure of the accepted practice. The judiciary cannot intervene into Parliamentary affairs. However, the ICCPR cannot impose any judgment on us. It can only recommend and it is up to the Government to decide whether to accept it or not, the PM said.
