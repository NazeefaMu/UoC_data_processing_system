Nutrition standards of low-income families to be enhanced
The nutrition standard of children in low-income families in the Matara District is to be enhanced, Samadhi Community Development Foundation Chairman and the Matara District Parliamentarian Buddhika Pathirana said.
These programmes are successfully in progress at the Divisional Secretariat Division level in the Matara district, he added. A survey carried out in the district by the Foundation had revealed that over 26,000 families with underweight children are in the Matara District at present and another 5,000 school-going children are also suffering from poor eye vision.
The poverty alone had not been the reason for this sad situation. Various health problems have also affected these poor health conditions, he said. Measures have been taken to identify 20 low-income families with underweight children from each Grama Niladari area in the district and also to provide them with nutrition packets worth over Rs. 7,500.
In addition, tins of nutritive milk power, each worth over Rs. 10,000 are also to be distributed among underweight children between six months to four years of age, under the Samadhi Kekulu Suwasetha Project affiliated to the Matara Samadhi Community Development Foundation.
The Foundation will check the weight of these children prior to handing over food items.
The progress they have made after giving these nutriments will also be monitored in a few months. These welfare programmes are underway in the Divisional Secretariat Divisions of Thihagoda, Kirinda Puhulwella, Hakmana, Kamburupitiya, Akuressa, Athuraliya, Devinuwara, Weligama and Matara. They will also be extended to other Divisional Secretariat Divisions as well.
Funds of local and international donor organizations are utilized in this regard, MP Pathirana added.

I am no American agent
In his first press appearance as Navy Commander, Vice Admiral Travis Sinniah speaking of past controversies said that under his leadership the slate will finally be wiped clean.
He immediately faced questions about rumours that he is an agent for the United States government, an accusation frequently thrown at him by members of the previous regime.
Sinniah worked briefly at the American Embassy in Colombo as a security specialist.
Im being accused of being an American agent, but in my view if that is so, then it is good for our country as we would benefit from such an alliance, he said. But, people can assume anything ... these people dont know what it is to be an American agent.
When asked by reporters about Naval officers accused of the abduction and disappearance of 11 students at the end of the LTTE terrorist war, Sinniah said that he would not protect them if they were found guilty in court.
In Sri Lanka, everyone is innocent until proven guilty, he said.
But wearing this uniform doesnt give you the sanction to rob, wearing this uniform doesnt give you the sanction to murder, wearing this uniform doesnt give you the sanction to torture, he said.
Sinniah said that the Navy would also accept any verdict in the court proceedings against Yoshitha Rajapaksa, the son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is accused of engaging in political activities while serving as a Naval officer.
He added that he did not of the view that the charges against Rajapaksa as serious.
On the ongoing issue of Indian fishermen poiaching into Sri Lankan waters, Sinniah said he would take a different approach than the previous command.
We have always opposed the Indian fishermen. We are not going to oppose them, he said. We are going to help them understand where the international borderline is.
He said he would order an increase in presence patrols along the sea border.
When they stray into our water, we will take them out, he added.
Vice Admiral Sinniah joined the Navy in 1982. He fought in numerous sea battles during the terrorist war, including capturing the LTTE second-in-command and nine LTTE leaders. He is the first Tamil Navy Commander in four decades.

Beauty from the deep
The world judges you from your looks and how you dress yourself. Acne doesnt just affect your looks  breakouts can damage self-esteem and impact on your quality of life. It can become a barrier for establishing relationships and developing social skills. Apart from social phobia, it can also lead to fear of being mocked by others and disabling shyness. The good news is that there are ways to tackle and combat this issue.
What is acne
Acne is a disease that affects the skins oil glands. It is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that causes spots and results in whiteheads, blackheads, pimples, cysts, and nodules, especially on the face, shoulders, back, neck, chest, and upper arms. Acne leaves skin scars too.
Types of acne
Acne Vulgaris: This is the most common form of acne that we see on a regular basis.
Black heads: This type of acne is extremely common and is usually seen on the nose and nasal area. They look like tiny areas of black lumps on the skin, which are formed as a result of blocked follicles. The black lumps are usually formed when bacteria, dead skin and harmful substances clog the follicles and reach the surface. These react with the oxygen present in the air and result in the appearance of blackheads.
Whiteheads: These are white spots on the skin. Due to excessive oil production, the glands are clogged with oil and covered by skin. As a result, the oil cannot reach the surface and is trapped between the skin layers, resulting in the appearance of white spots.
Papules: These are a type of acne that are inflamed and appear as small red dots or bumps on the skin. These may or may not be sensitive to touch.
Pustules: Pustules are inflamed acne that are hard to touch and are usually filled with pus. These appear as white spots and the center is mostly pale yellow.
Nodules: This is one of the more severe types of acne which is much larger than papules or pustules. A nodule is a painful and inflamed bump. It doesnt have pus and is hard to the touch. This can only be cured by proper medical treatment and usually requires the use of strong medicines.
Cysts: Acne that is deep, appears big, and is pus filled, is called a cyst. It is quite painful to touch and needs immediate attention from a doctor.
Severe types of acne
Acne Fulminans: This type of acne is seen in young men. It is accompanied by symptoms like fever and joint ache and leaves scars.
Acne Mechanica: This originates as a result of excessive heat and friction between the skin. It is usually seen in people involved in sports or those who wear helmets, caps or sports gear for prolonged periods of time on a regular basis.
Acne Rosacea: This is quite similar to acne vulgaris. It appears as a red colored rash on the cheek and chin.
Pyoderma Faciale: This is a severe type of acne and is a combination of nodules and pustules. It is generally seen among women between the ages of 20 to 40.
Acne Conglobata: This is the severest type of acne which is seen in both male and females. It appears as a large lesion on the skin which is interconnected and usually affects the chest, upper arms, face, thighs and buttocks. This is a rare type of acne and often leads to skin damage and permanent scars.
Food that causes breakouts
Certain foods can cause breakouts. Eating a diet rich in refined carbs, saturated fats, and other processed foods can develop acne. A diet with a high glycemic index  basically, processed foods like bread and refined grains that are quickly broken down into sugar can have a terrible effect on skin as it leads to increased sebum production and clogged pores.
From generation to generation
It is most likely that acne has a hereditary component but it is not completely a genetic disease. Our genetics are passed down to us from our parents. The human bodys immune system is responsible for how we deal with bacteria. This means that some people will struggle with dry skin and blackheads, while other people will struggle with overly oily skin and whiteheads
Genes also determine how well your body can clear up your pores. Some people inherit the ability to shed dead skin cells in a way that does not clog their pores; others shed dead skin cells in a way that causes a clogging of the pores. Unfortunately if a childs parents both had acne, it is much more likely that the child will develop some sort of acne as well.
The gender factor
Women are more likely to be affected by acne because of hormonal fluctuations related to the menstrual cycle and menopause.
No more make up
Makeup is said to clog your pores, prevent your skin from breathing. Makeup can definitely aggravate acne or make acne worse. Sometimes this is the result of makeup wearers not realizing that they are sensitive or allergic to certain ingredients. It may also be the result of them forgetting to take their makeup off after a day of wear, therefore clogging up or blocking pores. However, its not the makeup alone that causes acne. These issues associated with makeup have the potential to worsen, aggravate, or even trigger acne in some people. Even if your acne was aggravated or instigated by your makeup you dont need to give up cosmetics. Use oil free water-based products since these are usually the best kind for those with acne.
Consult a dermatologist
Dermatologists are skincare experts trained in identifying and treating a variety of skin conditions, including acne. They should be consulted if:
l Over-the-counter products are not alleviating your acne. Often, over-the-counter products are not strong enough to help moderate to severe acne.
l Your acne is preventing you from normal social activity. Acne can greatly impact self-esteem and self-image and can cause social withdrawal.
l You begin to see scars after blemishes clear. Untreated scars can become permanent. A dermatologist can provide treatments that specifically alleviate scarring.
l Your acne isnt improving or has gotten worse. If your acne has become more severe, a dermatologist will be able to prescribe you stronger medication.

BLOCKBUSTER SOUNDTRACKS AT SOSL POPS CONCERT
Transport yourself into worlds beyond  from The Lord of the Rings to the Chronicles of Narnia or embark on a Mission Impossible, traipse the streets of Chicago, immerse yourself in tales from Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King and watch The Gladiator from the grandstand! The Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka takes you on a whirlwind journey of timeless classics and blockbuster soundtracks at its annual SOSL POPS concert on the 16th and 17th of September at the Bishops College Auditorium with a promise of an extraordinary evening of film soundtracks guaranteed to have all film enthusiasts asking for more. Under the baton of Dushyanthi Perera, the programme gains added lustre with four amazing soloists Bhathiya Jayakody, Shehara Liyanage, Dinushka Jayawickreme and Amandhi Caldera.
The sweeping grandeur of the Symphonic Suite from the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe from The Chronicles of Narnia aptly open the curtains for a programme replete with classic film and Broadway hits, which have over decades serenaded, entertained and regaled audiences around the world. Whether its some swinging jazz that is so archetypically George and Ira Gershwin or some toe taps in the Salute to Ol Blue Eyes arranged by John Boss, a medley from Chicago reminiscent of the emotive nuances of passion, jealousy and hate or the story of the star-crossed lovers from Casablanca, the orchestral scores accompanying expressive solo voices revert you to eras past or times of the future.
Step into the fantastic stories of Walt Disneys Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King and let out the child in you. And of course, there are missions to complete as speed defying stunts become vivid backdrops for the theme from Mission Impossible and you hear the roar of the spectators as The Gladiator marches into the arena, intense in its portrayal in the music of Hans Zimmer. Then theres a trio of songs made popular by the phenomenal Josh Groban, all of which make this a memorable evening reminiscent of the thrills and spills of the silver screen combined with some poignant moments that brings on a tear or two.

Many mourners lined the cemetery with his wife, two daughters, two granddaughters, two sons- in-law and other family members who joined in his last journey. It is customary for Bodhi to visit his home in Kandy once a month and do some cleaning.

Burj Khalifa, a must for travellers to Dubai
Peering through the glass walls of the Observation Deck at Level 148 of the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, the aerial view of Downtown Dubai, in the heart of the city, is something else: the deep blue of the Burj Khalifa Lake is the centerpiece of architectural excellence around which stands the many skyscrapers synonymous with the city.
The lake itself surrounds a golf course, the contrasting colours of deep blue and green amidst a setting sun, a heady mix indeed. Then again, an aerial view of the Dubai Fountain, the spurting concentric circles, the vertical rise of water, is amazing.
On another side of 'At the Top', as the Burj Khalifa Sky is billed, the maze of wide flyovers, for which this city is famous, is another sight to behold. Stretches of desert then spread out from the heart of the city.
The mega-tall skyscraper is a total of 829.8 m high and is part of a mixed use development plan from Emaar Properties, to make Downtown Dubai, what it is now - the Centre of Now, the world's most visited destination.
After Level 148, the Burj Khalifa thins into a spire which has made it the iconic building it is. One enters the skyscraper through the Dubai Mall. The elevator zooms the several hundred floors in minutes, while its walls screen the architectural marvels of this iconic skyscraper.
As you leave, a Burj Khalifa signboard says 'goodbye' in different languages, a touching testament to embracing the world. For Sri Lankans, it was gihila ennam.
Back in Dubai Mall, the world's largest shopping and entertainment destination is another attraction.
Or if shopping does not beckon, Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo or Dubai Dino, the resident Jurassic dinosaur are other attractions.
"You need six hours to visit the mall," said an official of the property.
View of the performing Dubai Fountain and dhows that ply part of the Burj Khalifa Lake while dining at a restaurant.
The wide boulevard of Opera District, lined with palm trees all lit up, the centre of the 2,000 seat Dubai Opera, luxury hotels and residences, all of which make Dubai a truly global city and world-class destination.

Change makers, ground   breakers
They say that great minds and great experiences can ignite ideas together. They influence change in the society, environment and economy. Known as change makers, path breakers and ground shakers these exceptional individuals harness an insatiable appetite to develop, change and create meaningful action. They emerge from different walks of life but are cut from the same cloth. Life is there to be lived and when done right  its simply a buzz.
The Queens Young Leaders programme is designed to discover, celebrate and support exceptional youth from across the commonwealth. Each year a handful of youth who have made a lasting impact on the community and beyond by using their skills to transform lives are chosen to be felicitated by Queen Elizabeth II. Rakitha Malewana was among the few who received the Queens Award this year. The 21 year old is an old boy of Nalanda College, Colombo, who is currently studying for the undergraduate degree at American National College.
I am working on two major fields at the moment. The first component is conducting researches. My basic research work is primarily based on medical and molecular biology with the special interest of oncology and microbiology. Designing and synthesizing novel drug candidates to treat deadly diseases has become one of my sole happiness and passions. My childhood was surrounded by various disastrous backgrounds such as seeing people dying because of terrorism and people dying due to various health issues. Therefore, what inculcated in me was find out a profession that I can truly help mankind to enrich my community with peace, Rakitha explained.
Venturing into social service activities, Rakitha has touched many lives with the volunteer activities he conducts on behalf of disadvantaged communities. This, he notes, is the second most fascinating component in his life.
I advocate people: specially marginalized community by networking advocacy programmes on sexual and reproductive health issues with the special focus on HIV/AIDS. The background reason to start working in this field was my voluntary teaching experience for the children of HIV/AIDS positive individuals who live around Colombo slum areas. The journey to those places candidly changed my life. There, stigma and discrimination to a HIV positive individual are sky-scraping. Seeing the brutal reality of the pain of HIV individuals is the major motivation factor for me to continue my work on behalf of the HIV positive community, he said adding that his acts of lighting up the lives of the distressed and the needy, empowering them to come to terms with their issues and accepting them for who they are is what he enjoys most about his work.
Milestone
He notes that developing the nano-vaccine for HIV was a milestone in his work since it is a timely needed advancement which benefits HIV positive individuals. This discovery won him a gold medal at the International Science Projects Olympiad (ISPrO) 2015 held in Jakarta, Indonesia.
He has also won a gold medal and the first prize for the research titled A Low Cost and Eco Friendly Method to Cure Cancer: anticancer effect of Catechin coated Iron Oxide Nano particles on Leukemic cells by using Waste Iron at International Environment and Sustainability Project Olympiad (INESPO) 2015 held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Rakithas research titled Using Nano Technology as an Anticancer Agent: anticancer effect of Catechin coated Iron Oxide Nano particles on Leukemic Monocytes clinched a bronze medal at the International Science Projects Olympiad (ISPrO) 2014 held in Jakarta, Indonesia. The project also got him to the finals of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF) 2014 held in Los Angeles, California, USA. His project titled Effect of Young jack fruit extract (Artocarpus heterophyllus) and Cinnamon bark (Cinnamomum verum) extract to increase platelet count in wistar rats got him through to the finals at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF) 2013 held in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. He was nominated as a global finalist at Ferias CT+1 International Young Scientist Fair 2014 held in Medellin, Colombia, and at the Taiwan International Science Fair 2014 held in Taipei, Taiwan.
Rakitha has represented Sri Lanka at London International Youth Science Forum (LIYSF) 2015 held in London, UK. He took part in the event due to a special invitation handed out by the Prime Minister of UK.
He was listed in the Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia - Class of 2017 in the healthcare and science sector and named as one of the youngest honorees from all categories. This event recognises Asias brightest young entrepreneurs, innovators and game changers. He is a Leader of Tomorrow awardee, a global gathering of individuals who have excelled in academia and business, organized by the International Students Committee from University of St. Gallen, Switzerland.
Receiving the Queens Young Leaders Award from Queen Elizabeth II
Rakithas father, Anura Malewana, is an Education Director while his mother, Upeksha Abeysekara , is a teacher at Nalanda College, Colombo. His brother, Akila Malewana, is a final year undergraduate at UOC.
Queried on the challenges he has faced while engaging in his work Rakitha notes that the lack of resources, facilities and the conventional mind sets of the Sri Lankan people are some of the barriers he had to break through in bringing about awareness and change through his work.
He says that there is a lack of opportunities for youth to develop their skills.
As youth, it is our duty to work hard by taking the lead in the society to lay a sincere platform by overcoming challenges on behalf of other existing lives to make our community a better place, Rakitha opined.
Rakitha is also a co-founder and youth convener at United Youth Consortium (UNYCom), a community based organization which is working on behalf of the rights of HIV/AIDS positive individuals.
Positive culture
UNYCom is currently conducting many projects based on a vast scope. It is really hard to work on topics like Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) in schools/society due to the traditional culture and system of Sri Lanka.
However, we are trying to establish a positive culture where people can discuss their opinions about SRH with no hesitation in the society. Moreover, I am providing counseling sessions to HIV positive individuals to free their minds from anxiety and social depression. To date I have personally conducted more than 500 counseling sessions and the outcome and feedback is truly overwhelming, he said. Apart from UNYCom Rakitha is also working on ideanerd SL, for which he is the founder. It is a community based organization for popularization of scientific research among school students in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka is a developing country and because of its lack of higher education opportunities, the competition for the local higher education is mounting. As a result of this students are not involving in any extra-curricular activity in their high school life.
With the other members of the Youth Activist team of UNYCom
They are reluctance to innovate or solve the problems that the country is facing. In such situations, as the first Sri Lankan student to get the permission to do a biomedical research with the approval of the Government, I really needed to establish a culture for high school students to motivate them to conduct scientific researche.
The result is ideanerd Sri Lanka which reflects that adopting innovation in education can help build creativity and better abilities to solve problems.
Conducting a technical workshop on science research at Mattegoda Vidyadeepa Vidyalaya
By Promoting research and innovation among the school students in Sri Lanka and to give special attention to the rural areas, initiating, facilitating and supporting basic and applied scientific research including the research in social sciences to establish a sustainable and viable research culture for the greater benefit of the country, we motivate, inspire and uplift students to get an international exposure.
The ideanerd SL initiative for research and innovation in science has been nurturing the real spirit of innovation among school students in Sri Lanka since 2012, Rakitha said.
The gifted youth wishes to complete his undergraduate degree and continue focusing on medical research. He is working on expanding ideanerd Sri Lanka to establish a common platform and inspire young researchers to conduct medical research and innovations in the future.

CID probe on Peoples Merchants missing Rs 2,220 million
Unaudited for during Rajapaksa regime :
The Peoples Merchant Bank has called in the CID to unravel the mystery behind Rs. 2,220 million which had gone missing from its funds during the Rajapaksa regime making the institution bankrupt.
The Banks management had also discovered a sinister plan hatched to make the Bank inactive and build a 30 storeyed building at its land housing the head office at Navam Mawatha, Colombo. Plans had also been hatched during the period 2013 to 2014 to close down this profit making banking institution by halting its business activities alltogether.
The financial loss of Rs. 2220 million is shown in the Banks audit reports too.
There are allegations that funds belonging to this bank were utilised to achieve political objectives and needs during the Rajapakse regime. It is alleged that a large account of the banks funds had been used to feed large gatherings at tamashas and danselas held at Temple Trees during the Rajapaksa period of rule.
A fleet of 20 low quality tractors imported on the pretext of importing Massey Ferguson tractors are lying idle gathering rust in a vehicle park in Kurunegala.
All this information had been supplied to the CID for investigation and Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim has been made aware of the situation. During the Rajapaksa regime nearly 70 percent of this Banks shares were held by a financial institution friendly with the Rajapaksa clan and named in Panama papers. The Bank has now recovered these shares after the present government came to power.
Reports said the Bank is now being revived by minimising losses under the guidance of Minister Kabir Hashim.The Peoples Merchant Bank is a subsidiary of the Peoples Bank.

Citizens' Mail
A self-destructive strategic plan!
I read with considerable scepticism the Tourism Ministrys new strategic plan to focus on increasing tourist spending rather than tourist numbers.
Already Sri Lankas hotel and restaurant industry provides Third World services at First World prices. By imposing minimum hotel rates the government effectively kills the competition that may contribute to a change in this status quo.
Wealthy tourists rarely visit Sri Lanka, as there are far better destinations with better amenities closer home. The typical Western tourist who comes to our shores is either a backpacking student or a lower middle-class couple who have saved for many years to have what is once-in-a-lifetime experience. Yet many Sri Lankans seem to equate white skin with wealth, and coupled with the widespread beggar mentality, this quickly alienates people who could otherwise be Sri Lankas best tourism ambassadors in their own countries.
As for the Chinese and Russian markets, these visitors usually come in tour-groups and payments are made in their home countries.
Sri Lanka will never match, say, Thailand in attractiveness, simply because our hotels and restaurants are over-priced.
The Thai government also does not practice the discrimination that the Sri Lankan government does with regard to foreign tourists.
Sri Lankan tourism developers have a get-rich-quick mentality which is harmful to the real development of the country.
A clever businessman thinks long-term: he knows that winning the trust and loyalty of customers through providing satisfactory, honest and reliable services is the best way to market his product and stay for the long haul. Foreign visitors, from the time they arrive at the Colombo airport, are harassed by all kinds of touts and con-men.
Those who are independent travellers (not staying in private homes or luxury hotels, and not part of charter groups) are especially vulnerable.
Why the airport authority, in conjunction with the Tourist Development Board, cannot provide pre-paid taxi services at the same rates for locals and foreigners, as is done in many other Asian airports, is beyond my understanding.
Furthermore, what Sri Lankan values does a tourist learn who has been forced to pay several thousand rupees to climb Sigiriya, explore ruined cities, obtain a pavement seat for the Esala Perahera, or visit the Dalada Maligawa Surely World Heritage Sites belong to citizens of the world and not just to Sri Lankans.
The irony is that it is often these visitors governments that are paying for the maintenance of these sites through international agencies. Isnt this practice of charging one rate for locals and a much higher rate for foreigners, despite the fact that some locals are far richer than many Westerners, simply racist In any case, can we know how much of the dollars collected at such sites ends up in the public treasury
Instead of hiring expensive foreign PR agents to promote Sri Lanka abroad, why doesnt the Tourist Board read the large amount of research that already exists on how to make tourism a means to alleviate poverty rather than making more Fat Cats

Competencies for political leaders
Leaders are of different kinds. This is probably why James MacGregor Burns once said Leadership was one of the most observed and the least understood phenomenon on earth. Among different kinds of leaders, political leaders are the least researched and studied.
In my opinion, the best way to categorize political leaders is based on their time orientation. Certain leaders glorify the past. They always talk about what they had and what they have lost. They always tend to compare what is not there now as opposed to what was there in the past. It is evident that they struggle to let go of the past. On the other hand, some leaders are more futuristic and tend to look into the future with a more optimistic approach. Yet another set of political leaders focus on the now where they neither focus on the future nor glorify the past. It is safe to say that they have a myopic view of the future and do not glorify the past. Apart from these three kinds of leaders, it would not be an exaggeration to point out that there is another set of leaders who do not do anything at all.
If we carefully observe and analyze the types of leaders we as the general public have elected and sent to the parliament to represent us, all these four kinds of leaders can be found there discussing the issues that matter to us and taking decisions on our behalf.
Economic and social benefits
Within the course of seven decades of post-independence, for about three decades we were fighting a bloody ethnic war. In that sense, we have no past to glorify. Because what we have achieved is nothing more than pained hearts and souls. With due respect to the leaders who ended the bloody war, it is time to make use of the freedom won rather than wasting time and energy in glorifying the past without forgetting the fact that we have a lot to catch up on as a country. When we compare ourselves with other countries in the region that won their independence and freedom during the same period, they seemed to have progressed much faster than us and have achieved greater economic and social benefits. If we are to blame and point fingers at someone or something, I am sure the leaders who have run the country up to now should be our first choice.
We as a country and an economic unit have an enormous amount of issues thanks to our past politicians and the decisions they have made. Some examples of such issues are the heaps of foreign loans taken at staggering commercial rates without proper planning and prioritization, which requires immediate corrective action. Moreover, there are certain areas that have progressive problems which can lead to economic, social and political catastrophes at a national level. What is not working should be fixed and that is an indisputable fact. However, there should be an approach to transform the prevailing situation into a much larger economically beneficial situation, which is future oriented and filled with opportunities. There are ample examples around us to learn and benchmark ourselves against, starting from South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia.
If we carefully study the countries that were transformed from once being poor economies to current economic giants in the global arena, their success stories can always be attributed to a leader or a set of leaders. These leaders had something that other leaders did not have or they did something that other leaders did not do. There must be an innate quality in these leaders that made them do something different and unique. Either they had a strong political will with a futuristic view or they knew that what was required had to be done without giving into political pressure. After all, they possessed the much-needed skills to get things done and make things happen.
International trade and commerce
At the moment, Sri Lanka is undergoing a transformation or at least we have realized that the country needs a political and economic overhaul. The question is how capable the political leaders are at convincing their electorate that these changes are a must even if they are not politically popular Do they know what our immediate critical issues are at a macro level Can they get out of micro level, individual issue based relationship management and focus more on macro level issues at a national level Can they demonstrate the much-needed behavioural competencies in managing their relationships with much wider and dynamic communities How informed are they of the international changes that are taking place and changing the dynamics of international trade and commerce How enthusiastic are they to embrace innovative and disruptive technologies that may present unprecedented growth opportunities or eradicate the traditional opportunities for growth Do all these leaders share the same mental model of the countrys development and the challenges faced by the economy
Let us try to understand the broader issues faced by Sri Lanka as a country and see what kind of competencies that these so called politicians should possess if they are to contribute to the overall successful transformation of the country.
1. The need to increase economic growth  This can be considered the most pressing issue that we need to battle as a country. It seems that a consistent economic growth with a minimum trade deficit can be the solution to most of the issues that are there today. It is not an exaggeration to say that we should increase our exports and manage our imports by restricting and discouraging unnecessary imports with the objective of retaining foreign reserves. Every political leader should have a clear understanding as to how every single activity done by their respective portfolios is connected to achieving the much needed economic growth, be it short term or long term. In this context it is important that every parliamentarian takes off his or her micro level thinking hats and embrace a macro level approach to their work. This essentially requires getting rid of traditional cause and effect thinking and adapting a systems thinking approach. Otherwise, history will repeat itself and there is a greater possibility that todays solutions can become tomorrows problems. What is popular is not always effective. They should be willing to make tough calls for the betterment of the country in the long run.
2. Reducing corruption  Corruption has escalated to a whole new level in the recent past. Traditional methods of bribery and taking commissions have been modernized leading to a number of white-collar crimes. The question is whether the existing rules and regulations pertaining to bribery and corruption are strong enough to prevent such national level corruption. Corruption should be discouraged, eradicated and penalized at both micro and macro levels across the country.
3. Enhancing transparency  In a country where literacy rate is above 90%, people tend to read, write and comprehend ongoing matters to a greater extent. Some people may ask questions as to how different development projects were done, on what basis they were awarded, on what conditions the loans were taken etc. whilst some may not be interested at all. Just by enacting the act of right to information, transparency will not be upheld nor promoted. Both the general public and the bureaucrats should be empowered to look for and share what is relevant and important without causing unnecessary troubles to the development process. Transparency goes hand in hand with reducing corruption. The greater the magnitude of transparency the lesser the room for corruption. Whilst the culture of secrecy should be discouraged along with the unwillingness of bureaucrats to share such information, enabling efficient processes to facilitate this objective is also paramount.
4. Improving social well-being  Improving social well-being should go beyond the physical and the mental health of the general public. As a country, we spend a considerable amount of tax rupees on physical health and it seems that efforts to address mental health has taken a back seat. The efforts or objectives of improving social well-being should necessitate much larger macro level benefits across the country without focusing only on underprivileged groups. In fact it should go beyond the general public. It means, that whilst the whole economy creates equal opportunities for the general public it also ensures a decrease in income inequality. These efforts should focus on creating a fair playing field for cooperates to carry out their profit oriented ventures without undue influences.
With regard to the four-macro level challenges clarified above, every parliamentarian, whether s/he is in the government or in the opposition, should possess a minimum of the following competencies for the sake of the overall development of the country. All of them should make a conscious paradigm shift from being bogged down in their own political ideology towards a more open minded perspective by keeping their eyes focused on the changes that are happening internationally.
Insights into the interests of the general public
1. Committing to the general public as a whole, regardless of political ideology or political party they support. This should come with the understanding that in a democratic society people appoint leaders of their choice to get what they need and want. At the end of the day all these needs and wants are similar, therefore treating them equally is a must even if they have not voted for you or your political party.
2. In a country where open-economy has been instrumental as the engine of growth, the private sector should be truly empowered to live up to its full potential. Therefore, creating a business friendly economic and political environment across the island is a must. This includes enacting policies and programmes to encourage entrepreneurship and the creation of new ventures.
3. The need to eradicate corruption has been identified as a macro level challenge but it has to be implemented and monitored at the level of individual leaders as the general public tends to think that if corruption is eradicated the benefits can be passed on to them in the form of social welfare.
4. No economy can grow without getting its own people to consume more. Domestic consumption can only increase if purchasing power is increased in terms of per capita income on a yearly basis. This can only be achieved if leaders take the standards of living of the general public into serious consideration. Every parliamentarian, especially those who hold ministerial portfolios should understand as to how their respective programmes result in raising the standards of living of the general public.

Dayasiri seeks remedy for cricket downfall
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara has invited all those involved in cricket to a seminar on ways to improve the future of Sri Lanka cricket.
As Sri Lanka cricket stumbles, the minster addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing said it is time for all stakeholders to put aside their personal differences and come together to rebuild the team.
A committee consisting of National Sports Council chairman - Milton Amarasinghe (Chair), Prof. Ranjith Bandara (Colombo University), Saman Bandara (DG - Sports Development Department) and Dr. Lakshman Edirisinghe (DG - Sports Medicine Institute) are to precede over the discussion. The seminar is expected to be organized within the next two weeks.
The minister has invited former SLC chairman, former SLC Interim Committee chairman, former national cricket captains, senior sports journalists, national selectors, national coaches, and some renown sports personalities such as; Daya Ratnayake, Dayan Gomez, Manilal Fernando, Palitha Fernando, Hemasiri Fernando and heads of district and provincial cricket associations to take part in the discussion.
"We hope to have discussions on 10 main themes and we will also discuss reasons for the recent downfall and possible solutions. At the end of it a report of all suggestions will be compiled and presented to the Sri Lanka Cricket Board, said the Sports Minister.
He asked all those involved to attend the discussion instead of airing out their personal opinions through the media or in other forms.
"I do not interfere with cricket but as the final decision maker, I too have certain responsibilities to resolve the issue. So lets all get together and talk about the issue," said Jayasekara as he made clear that the invitation is not from the Sri Lanka Cricket Board chairman but from the Sports Minister.

Ericsson supports SL's nation building by promoting the digital agenda
Ericsson is shaping the future of mobile broadband Internet communications through its continuous technology leadership and is contributing to Sri Lankas nation building agenda through our various initiatives like Connect to Learn , 5G Island of Innovation and by partnering with Dialog for its Cumulus initiative, said Vinod Samarawickrama, Country Manager for Ericsson in Sri Lanka.
Ericsson has undertaken a variety of research projects with partners, to trial new technologies in robotics, drones, cloud, big data, all underpinned by 5G connectivity. Ericsson has more operator partnerships in 5G than any other vendor, and large industry partnerships with ABB, SKF, Boliden, Volvo, BMW, and many more.
"We are leading innovation with the best 5G platforms for the real world ," Samarawickrama said.
In an interview, Vinod Samarawickrama, speaks on industry trends, Ericsson future plans in Sri Lanka and beyond.
What did you showcase at the technology roadshow with Dialog being carried out in their office
Ericsson and Dialog Axiata PLC have successfully showcased the future of mobile broadband through a live demonstration of 5G technology. This is the first 5G Demonstration in South Asia and we are very proud to have partnered with Dialog to bring this to Sri Lanka. The demonstration includes Ericssons 5G test bed, 5G New Radio (NR) and use cases such as a motion-sensing robotic arm and live 4K video streaming.
We also demonstrated the ability of 5G to support 4K video streaming. 4K content was streamed from a server to a radio base station and then relayed to 5G user equipment and displayed on a 4K TV screen. With 5G radio, a single network cell will be able to support playback of 4K video by hundreds of simultaneous users.
How is Ericsson leading the development of 5G in the world
Ericsson is uniquely positioned as a leader in the development of standards for 5G systems. Our active participation and leadership in global standardization organizations and open source communities enable us to play a key role in shaping future technologies.
Ericsson has undertaken a variety of research projects with partners, to trial new technologies in robotics, drones, cloud, big data, all underpinned by 5G connectivity.
We are leading innovation with the best 5G platforms for the real world: by contributing to 5G standards and pioneering the worlds first 5G NR ready radio  the Ericsson AIR 6468, which is on display at the Road Show.
We are leading and driving the 5G standards work from today's exploratory research and pre-standard field trials, through influential standards bodies and industry groups. Today, we have 15 industry pilots and 22 operator partners.
What do Sri Lankan operators need to do now to prepare for 5G
To get ready for 5G, organizations need to have a clear strategy for growth and plans to transform the organization to leverage the opportunities afforded by the new technology. Ericsson is an ideal partner to help develop that strategy, make the right choices, and implement seamlessly.
As 5G includes so much more than radio, the transition to 5G for operators will be more extensive than any previous generation network. At Ericsson, we are building 5G as an evolution and extension of our industry-leading 4G LTE technology, and as a result, we expect many components to be launched before 2020.
Although standards organizations plan to complete the specifications by 2020, 5G activity is ramping up throughout the industry. Many operators already have plans to move to 5G, and they are starting to choose the vendors that they intend to work with. Although 2020 seems far off in the future, the journey to 5G has already begun.
How is Ericsson contributing to Sri Lankas nation building agenda using ICT 
We are contributing to Sri Lankas nation building agenda through our various initiatives like Connect to Learn , 5G Island of Innovation and by partnering with Dialog for its Cumulus initiative , just to name a few . You may be aware that we were the first to launch 3G services in Sri Lanka with Dialog in 2006 and we are looking forward to taking the lead when it comes to introducing 5G Services in Sri Lanka .
Regarding the 5G Island of Innovation we signed a MoU for the same with Mobitel and the Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure in March this year . This MoU represents a landmark strategic ICT partnership that aims to bring 5G Internet of Things (IoT) innovation and entrepreneurship to Sri Lanka for the first time in South Asia. The 5G Island of Innovation environment will further advance the nations ICT skills and capabilities, supporting the ambition to transform Sri Lanka into a digital and knowledge based society, driving new and increased employment opportunities enabled by ICT ecosystem innovations.
Ericsson will implement its 5G test bed technology in the Mobitel Innovation Centre in Colombo with the prime purpose of jointly creating a 5G IoT ecosystem designed to provide Sri Lankan ICT innovators an environment to develop and test 5G IoT applications and services.

IRD to open profile for all over 18
A profile of each person over 18 will be maintained by the Inland Revenue Department soon.
Department of Inland Revenue Deputy Commissioner General Nadun Guruge said yesterday that this was different from a tax file. However, if they find that anyone in the profile were liable to pay tax they would convert the profile into a tax file.
Similarly, if they are taxpayers any assets that have not been declared would be investigated and additional taxed collected.
He said there were tax dodgers also among professionals and they would be issued a polite letter first highlighting the fact that they were eligible to pay taxes and be invited to make their declaration 100% correctly. If they do not comply, it will have to be enforced, he said.
In Singapore, the population was 6.5 million but they have 40,000 registered for GST. But in Sri Lanka which has a population of over 22 million, only 20,000 VAT files have been opened, the Deputy Commissioner said.
That is why we have to widen our tax base, he said.
Guruge said they would gather all the information by interfacing the 35 institutions and urged the public to pay the correct tax and not to mess with the Department in the future and fall in trouble as they are going to address every aspect of potential tax payers with new software called RAMIS.

Japanese interest to develop Trincomalee

The Ambassador said that Singapore and ADB had been invited to draw plans to develop Trincomalee, while Japan had shown interest to be part of the process.
Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma remembered his previous visit to the Eastern Province and expressed his appreciation for the commitment and dedication of the Eastern Province in rebuilding infrastructure facilities and extensive training programmes with a special focus on womens participation and empowerment.
Meanwhile, Governor Bogollagama said, discussions on Trincomalee Industrial Development had been made with the Prime Minister during the event in Eravur and said that there will be tremendous opportunities in the East. Japan is interested in developing the Trincomalee Port and developing an Industrial Development Zone in the District. The Government will also invest some funds in the Trincomalee Port Development Project to connect with the Ampara and Hambantota ports. The domestic airport in Batticaloa has already been developed. A number of other development projects as well as tourism projects will be implemented in the area. Governor Bogollagama expressed the interest of the President on the Hingurangoda Airport to connect with the Eastern Province.
The next step is to get Japan investments to construct the mega hotels, create job opportunities, increase income, to make domestic entrepreneurs more competitive, emphasized the Governor. The Governor remembered the opening ceremony of Sigiriya Museum by Japanese Premier and reiterated the invitation to Prime Minister of Japan for a visit to Eastern Province and he added, there are plans to improve the transit facilities to invite the East Indian tourists since the Eastern Province has 41 major natural resources and 420 km long sea coast.

I am really impressed to see the development that took place in Eastern Province under the JICA Programme, the Governor said. The benefits of boosting womens participation in the workforce is not just about supporting human rights, its also about smart economics.
We should be working very hard on getting employment opportunities for women, Governor Bogollagama added and instructed the Chief Secretary of the Eastern Province to submit the progress review on the projects implemented by the Japanese Government.
The Chief Secretary described the details of the JICA Foreward Project, which focuses on communication and community empowerment, good governance and project management and entrepreneurship and livelihood development. New proposals are with the Deputy Chief Secretary.

Both sides should also expand non-governmental exchanges, implement the bilateral cooperative consensus in people's livelihood, inter-cultural engagement and further promote the cooperation in tourism and media exchange.
Governor Bogollagama also expressed about organizing a tour of Buddhist sites and explained about ancient Buddhist sites in the Eastern Province such as the Girihandusaya temple.

Kapugedera: Sri Lankas enigmatic cricketer reaches 100 ODIs
PALLEKELE: For a batsman who is playing his 100th One-Day International Chamara Kapugedera perhaps has a unique record of not having scored a century. Of the eight half-centuries that he has made his highest score is 95 against West Indies at Port of Spain in 2009.
That innings he scored batting at number seven after Sri Lanka had been reduced to 49-5. Although Sri Lanka recovered to post a total of 235-7 they lost a thrilling match that went down to the wire by one wicket off the last ball.
To many Kapugedera has been an enigma and one who is lucky to be in the current one-day side. If his stats are anything to go by no one would have given him a second look.
In ODIs he averages 20.97, in T20Is 22.97 and in Tests 34.83. He has not made a century in any of the three formats. And his first-class batting average is 32.95 and in List A he averages 28.29. So on what basis has been selected to play for his country
Consistency which the current Sri Lanka team is struggling to find is not something that is common with Kapugedera because he has never fulfilled the early promise he showed when he was picked as an 18-year-old for the VB Series against Australia at Perth in 2006 against the likes of Brett Lee, Glenn McGrath, Stuart Clark and Brad Hogg. He has been in and out of the team a number of times and should consider himself luckier than most cricketers who have better batting records than him and outshone him in performance.
Kapugedera has batted in the one-day side from opener to number 9 and his recent form doesnt suggest his inclusion in the team unless of course the selectors are in desperation for a batsman.
Lets hope at least in his 100th ODI Kapugedera can come up with a match-winning performance and justify his place in the team.

Lanka under pressure to win
With 2019 World Cup qualification at the back of their minds:
PALLEKELE: With rankings and 2019 World Cup qualification at the back of their minds Sri Lanka step into the Pallekele International Stadium today for the second one-day international against India knowing it is a must win game for them.
Sri Lanka was thrashed by nine wickets in the first ODI at Dambulla and had only themselves to blame for the defeat after capitulating from a position of strength at 150-2 to be all out for 216.
If you look at the past results we have been in good positions in the first 20-25 overs from there are onwards only we have lost the grip with batsmen playing irresponsible shots, said Sri Lanka captain Upul Tharanga.
To get to a big total we need the top four batsmen to fire. One or two of them must make a big score thats what we have seen in the past 10-15 years. If a player gets a century only we can put up a good total between 280 to 300. What I expect from the batsmen is once they have settled in they should bat the entire innings and take us to a decent total, he said.
There are occasions where the decisions we take dont work out as planned sometimes we dont have the luck on our side. Everyone is putting in their hard work and as a captain I believe that we need to be consistent in whatever we do especially in all three departments otherwise we will find it difficult to win especially against a team like India.
In the rankings we are in a position whether we will qualify for the 2019 World Cup or not. As a team we go into each match to win. Tomorrows contest is vital for us because we lost the first. To qualify for the 2019 World Cup we have to win two matches of the current series. We are all aware what is expected from us to qualify for the World Cup but if we think too much of it, it will affect our performances so we are taking it match by match.
When questioned whether Lasith Malingas inability to take wickets also contributed to Sri Lankas defeat, Tharanga replied, Malingas form has gone down from what it was 2-3 years ago. Any cricketer goes through this phase. He returned to ODI cricket after being out for about 18 months. But since his return he has been unable to produce those match winning performances mainly because catches have been dropped off his bowling. But his presence in the team is a big boon to the young fast bowlers who can learn a lot from him.
Coach Nic Pothas chipped in to add: We lost some giants of the game in the recent past and leaders within the change room. Malinga is a leader in the change room. We dont look at him purely from what he can do with the ball but also look at what he does for the young bowlers and, we have got a young mob of them.
Lasith is a very valuable player for us within that change room. Stats may show that he hasnt performed like the Lasith of three years ago but we could draw up a list of players around the world who are not performing years ago. What he does add in value is immeasurable. At the last Champions trophy Lasith had 9 catches dropped off his bowling.
Malinga who requires two wickets to reach 300 ODI wickets had a catch dropped of his bowling in the first ODI at Dambulla when Tharanga spilled an easy one offered by Shikhar Dhawan.
Tharanga said that there will be changes made to the final eleven for today although he did not name it. The likely scenario could be Dushmantha Chameera, Malinda Pushpakumara and Milinda Siriwardana replacing Thisara Perera, Wanindu Hasaranga and Lakshan Sandakan.
INDIA UNCHANGED
Indian captain Virat Kohli said that they may go into todays match with an unchanged side unless there is a drastic change in the wicket from Dambulla.
I havent had a look at the wicket yet. If the wicket is similar to Dambulla I dont see any reason to change the team just after one game. But everything is possible we put everything on the table and any combination is possible, said Kohli.
I am yet to have a look at the wicket but as I said it was a near perfect game for us I mean it was a perfect game I wouldnt say perfect because we came back into the game beautifully and then we consolidated it with the bat. We looked really sharp in the field as well. Very happy with how we went in the first game.

A LESSON  FROM THE CITY  OF BRISBANE

* Managing and developing a city
* In consultation with its residents
* Tribute to its people.
Just thought of sharing with the readers of Daily News a great news of, democracy in action, hoping that it would help to build awareness of what is happening in other developed countries around.
It was about a week ago, that every house in Brisbane received this attached notice along with the regular monthly newsletter from the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, a beautiful clean city in the world. I attach the two sides of the small notice that arrived with the newsletter.
The Lord Mayor is inviting the residents to meet him and his civic cabinet to express the views and discuss issues affecting the community in every subdivision within his municipality. The municipality is working with the residents and the local communities to help make our city what it is today with a long-term vision for the future, states the Lord Mayor.
Hosting Lord Mayors Listen Forums, throughout Brisbane is another way the council is achieving a vision for the citys future to ensure that is it heading in the correct direction.
In addition to this, the Municipality is in regular contact with the residents through its periodical newsletter. For instance, I look forward to it, for it is of great use as it is packed with information, of past, current and future events. As a senior, I look for activities around my location to participate.
In our country and in such third world countries democracy is in action only at times of voting and after the election is over those who gain power govern in their own way. There is no opportunity to participate in the running of the Municipality or the nation in general.
That is one reason there are so many protests and demonstrations displaying anger.
These Mayors too belong to political parties. But these newsletters have no mention of the party they belong to, or to express their political views. They look only at the improvement of the city, and the development of the quality of life.
People feel happy when the voted leaders consider the voters important in performing their elected mission. May these views help to change the attitudes of our politics.

A Lineage of Tamil Militancy: Mass Politics for Democracy
We believed revolution was possible:The 'Left' must unite :The officials here act like feudal lords:
Q: Could you speak about your family and your background
Did it have an influence on your politicisation
A: My family is from the Islands, Nainativu and Analaitivu and my father was a clerical servant in the Education Department. As a small boy, my family stayed with the Poobalasingam family in Kottati, Jaffna. He of course started the famous Poobalasingham Bookshop and was a Communist leader of Nainativu. My uncle Rajendran, was also a committed Communist. My mothers father, a Station Master, had died before I was born, but he left a good collection of books in Tamil and English. There were pictures of Nehru and Gandhi in our house. We had a copy of the Discovery of India by Nehru and the ten volumes of the Book of Knowledge. Then there were old Tamil books of Bharathy and then, Mahabaharatham and Ramayanam. When my father was working in Colombo, he used to send a package of newspapers and magazines every week by post. So, I was surrounded by books growing up and eventually read widely, and that had a great influence on me.
When I was in grade 7, we moved back to Jaffna from the Islands and I went to Jaffna Hindu College. At my A/L, I was politically conscious. I remember the protest march against the Republican Constitution of 1972 and the tense situation in Jaffna. I went to the World Tamil Research Conference in 1974, but I was not there on the last day that ended in the massacre. I remember how the police acted in Jaffna around the riots of 1977, I saw them pour kerosene and burn the New Market. So, I was influenced by the rising wave of Tamil nationalism.
Q: Your political life, as with many other pioneers of Tamilmilitancy, began as a youth activist in the late 1970s. What wasthe political setting and the intellectual influences during thecrucial years from the late 1970s into the early 1980s
A: I must truthfully say, we were critical of the traditional left. We did not accept their solution, and were critical of their alliance with communal forces. We also did not believe in parliamentary politics, which we thought was compromised.
There were two major influences at that time, one was the JVP uprising and the other was the separation of Bangladesh. So we believed an armed struggle was possible and that a country can be separated. To be honest, we were trying to argue for separation, and for that reason looked at theories like the Right to Self Determination. So we read about the struggle in East Timor, Mindanao and the Basque country in Spain.
There were many debates going on between the Communists like Shanmugathasan and the Tamil nationalists. Jaffna was politically and intellectually very active during the 1970s and 1980s. I did not pursue studies after my A/L, but there were many local intellectuals who influenced me. We ourselves as youth started many magazines.
There was Kailasapathy, A. J. Kanagaratna, Indrapala, Silan, Nuhman and Sivathamby at the University. There were also younger lecturers and students such as Nirmala, Nithiyandan, Chitralekha, Maunaguru, Varatharajaperumal, Somesasundary, Selvyn, Jeyapalan and Cheran. Outside the university those linked to the various left parties including Visuvananthathevan, Annamalai, Para, Thevarajah, Sinna Bala and there was Maniams bookshop for discussions and Senthivel and their party.
People like Kethesh Loganathan were supportive of us and introduced us to people who came in solidarity from the South including Vasu, Ananda Vakkumbura, Newton, Upali, Dayan, Sunila, Pulsara, Joe, from the Left parties and the Movement for Inter Racial Justice and Equality (MIRJE). We were also invited for seminars and discussions in the South.
Some people ran study groups for us and others challenged us to think about Maoism. There were political films shown at Trimmer Hall. We were absorbed by those times and believed revolution was possible.
Q: How did you get involved with Tamil militancy
A: In 1977, the Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (EROS) had been initiated in London by Ratnasabathy and Arular. And they also created the General Union of Eelam Students (GUES).
They made links with other struggles around the world, including with the Palestinian, African and other national liberation movements and wanted to think of the Tamil struggle in internationalist terms.
They had started a training camp in the Vanni, but with the Bastiampillai incident, when a few policemen were killed in the Vanni by the LTTE in 1978, all the camps in the Vanni were raided.
Those who had come from London for the discussions managed to leave. But that raised the question whether the leadership should be in London or here in Jaffna or in India.
In August 1980, about 15 of us met in Tamil Nadu for an organisers conference led by Pathmanabha. We went to Keerimalai, as if we were there for a swim and then the fishermen smuggled us to India. It was a just a few hours by boat to India. At that conference, we formed the Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) as a secret organisation. We decided that only the front organisations will surface, and I was put in charge of GUES.
GUES did a lot of work as the youth were interested. We started organising study groups in schools. Pathamanabha felt we had to work with the oppressed caste communities and recruit them into our struggle. A lot of women also joined our womens wing. My wife and comrade, Gnana, joined the movement in 1981. Jaffna society did not like us, because women and oppressed caste youth were moving freely with our movement.
We would travel long distances to meet activists working on issues. People were very receptive to us in the East. Many Muslim comrades also joined us. We worked with trade unions village workers union, co-operative union and some of the other left parties and united around many struggles. We organised a massive May Day rally numbering over a thousand people at Muthaveli in Jaffna. We did a major campaign against JRs referendum of 1982.
There were also tensions within the Tamil community and Tamil militants. We strongly condemned the murder of Suntharam by the LTTE in 1981. And then there was the caste murder of bus driver Annasamy in Punnalaikatuwanin 1982, which we protested. We did many massive poster campaigns on all these issues.
Q: The July 1983 riots escalated the armed struggle, how didit influence EPRLF and your work
A: After July 1983, boat loads of youth joined all the militant movements and we also set up training camps in India. But we could not carry out serious political education after that. We tried to have classes in the camps, but that is different from political education that comes with working with people on the ground. I think that was a huge setback for us.
On June 5, 1984, some of us had gone to a boat-driving comrades house in Myliddy for a meeting, and the army surrounded that house and arrested us. I was severely tortured. I thought I wont come out alive.
I was eventually moved to Welikada prison, where the situation was very different. The Tamil prisoners there were organised, we held political classes and there were even Karate classes! We prepared ourselves, in case there was a prison massacre like in 1983. We had many struggles for better prison conditions and food. We even managed to listen to the radio for news.
The lawyers who argued my case and kept my family informed were Francis Xavier, Kumar Ponnambalam and Joe Jeyaratnam. I was released on December 19, 1986.
By the time I was released, everything had changed. The LTTE had massacred TELO in April 1986, and followed with banning PLOTE, NLFT and PLFT. A week before I was released, they attacked EPRLF and banned it. By 1986, we were convinced that Tamil Eelam was not possible. We realised that separation was not possible with the Thimpu talks and Indias position.
Q: In 1987, with the Indo-Lanka Accord, EPRLF gained control of the North-East Provincial Council (PC). What wasEPRLFs role during and after its stint in power, and how did itinfluence your political thinking
A: We had committed PC members and officials, including people like Varatharajaperumal, Sivarajah, Sivathasan, Pathmanathan, Nachinarkiniyan and Vigneswaran attempting to make the PC system work. But with little support from the Government, it was a very difficult.
Subathiran, who was released with the Accord, and I wanted to again work with the people. These were tough times. Some of our cadres were very bitter about how the LTTE had attacked them. And there were many abuses by our side as well.
We have done a lot of self-criticism about that period. I am now aware of the dangers of armed struggle, how it brutalises a movement. Now, I believe, we should only consider non-violent mass struggles.
When the Indian army withdrew, we also had to leave for India. Tamil Nadu did not want to accept the retreating EPRLF cadres and families, and the ship landed in Orissa. Our cadres had a very difficult time. Then in 1990, Pathmanabha and 12 others were massacred by the LTTE in Chennai.
Q: With the EPRLF crippled, how did you see your role
A: When the Chandrika government came to power and the UNP government finally fell after 17 years, we felt there was an opening. Subathiran and I decided to try and work again, to keep some democratic space open in Jaffna. In 1997, we returned to Jaffna on the same flight with Mrs. Yogeswaran. As mayor, she wanted to work with everyone, until she too was killed by the LTTE.
Subathiran worked hard and created many connections in Jaffna. Raviraj was in Jaffna, and Anandasangaree with Mayor Kandiah tried to open the Jaffna Public Library despite the LTTEs threats.
People from the South again came and visited Jaffna during the peace process in early 2000. But the killings started again, and Subathiran was murdered in 2003.
I think we as a movement have made many sacrifices, and we have also influenced many people. We have left a certain thinking on some issues in the North, particularly in oppressed caste villages. But movements have their time and moment, and that also passes.
Q: The LTTEs demise in May 2009 ended a destructive andtragic period for Tamils and politics. Why is it, that 8 yearsafter the war and the democratic opening, progressive politicsis lacking and Tamil nationalist politics is dominating
A: Yes, I think a lot about that. After all the losses, so many who lost their lives, our Tamil society continues like nothing happened. We have to research and try and understand the reasons for this situation, and take forward a different politics.
To start with, democracy is still lacking in our society and in our relationship to the state. If an ordinary person goes to the Kachcheri, they are almost scared to go in. The officials here act like feudal lords.
There is little hope for a political solution now. There are few leftists in the South with whom we can discuss our issues.
And people in the villages are in a very difficult economic situation.
The state wants to crack down on those selling Kassippu and sand in some backward villages, but the sad reality is that, among some communities, if they dont do that, they have no other income. The economy is failing the people, and the Central Government and even the Provincial Government dont seem to have any solution other than using the police.
Anti-Muslim feelings are being cultivated, and even after their eviction and suffering, they are still not accepted by Jaffna society. Caste thinking is strengthening. In the villages, the roads, electricity and all of the state services, often stop just where the oppressed caste part of the village begins.
Those of us who come from a left background, even if we are fractured, there are hundreds of people here with such left thinking, and we need to come together.
We have to continue to work for democracy, social justice and reconciliation.

Link Engineering contributes to government infrastructure development
A leading player in the construction industry, Link Engineering has recorded a significant growth across all construction and engineering operations, particularly contributing to the government infrastructure development.
The company, which is part of the Blue ocean group is currently involved in a large number of construction projects that range from government funded constructions such as hospitals, universities and infrastructural projects to urban luxury condominiums and commercial buildings.
Commenting on the companys growth, Chairman of the Blue Ocean Group, S. Thumilan said, "The construction industry of Sri Lanka is at a stage where it is experiencing phenomenal growth. As a pioneering company in the industry, we know how important it is for a company to be versatile in as many different areas of construction as possible. For this reason we took a more diversified approach to our operations. As a result, today, Link Engineering has successfully expanded and engages in a wide range of construction areas."
With over four decades of experience under their belt, Link Engineering is currently shouldering a bulk of the state construction projects in addition to a multitude of condominiums and commercial properties. Its ability to provide professional, client oriented construction solutions and confirmed delivery has been key to its success across multiple segments. As a sub company of the condominium market leader, the Blue Ocean Group, Link Engineering has already cemented a sound financial plan for 2018 and 2019 with over 30 condominium projects and 16 government constructions in Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Kandy, Nuwara Eilya, Matara, Ratnapura, and Colombo.
Over the last decade, Government-funded projects have taken a prominent spot in the construction industry and Link Engineering has successfully claimed its share in this segment.
The company recently completed the construction of the clinic building of the General Hospital of Kalutara, SLBFE Regional Office in Ratnapura, new Court complex in Homagama, the Water Board Head Office Center in Ratmalana and the Faculty of Agriculture and the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Jaffna in Kilinochchi.
Having successfully completed many projects for government education institutes, the company has now risen to be a dominant player in this segment.
The firm is currently involved in the development of the Lecture theatre complex at the Faculty of Science at the University of Kaleniya, a lecture hall complex for the Faculty of Management at the University of Jaffna, an eight-storied building for the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Jaffna and a three-storied building at the Holy Family Convent in Jaffna. The commitment and expertise Link Engineering has showcased in construction of hospitals has earned them a reputation as one of the finest developers. This was proven when the company was awarded four mega projects worth over a billion rupees for Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Trincomalee and Mullweriyawa hospitals.
Under these projects, Link Engineering will construct the Accident and Emergency Treatment Units at the Teaching Hospital, Kandy, the Base Hospital, Trincomalee and the Colombo East Base Hospital in Mulleriyawa and a clinic at the Nuwara Eliya general hospital.
Link Engineering plans to leverage on its engineering capabilities to strengthen its presence in all sectors. Backed by sister companies Link Ready-mix, Link Aluminum, Contessa, Link Heavy Machineries, Link Engineering's performance has been consistently delivering profit to the group while maintaining the value of the asset portfolio.
With this solid contribution from Link Engineering, the Blue Ocean Group is planning its maiden overseas expansion in the South Asian region and hopes to have an active overseas operation during the forthcoming financial year.

Maxwell suffers mild heatstroke in Bangladesh
Dhaka: Australia are feeling the heat just days before their first Test against Bangladesh for more than a decade, with batsman Glenn Maxwell revealing Wednesday he suffered heatstroke during training.
"I caught a bit of heatstroke on the first day, which wasn't a good start," Maxwell told reporters in Dhaka.
"I think just doing some running outside, then going inside to do some fitness tests, and then going back outside didn't help too much.
"The body shut down a little bit but I was fine after the ice bath and plenty of fluids."
Australia, who arrived last Friday, limited themselves to light training Wednesday after their two-day warm-up match on the outskirts of Dhaka was cancelled due to flooding.
But 28-year-old Maxwell said conditions were still a little difficult for the newly-arrived squad.
"Yesterday was obviously pretty tough with the overnight and morning rain, all the moisture coming out of the ground and making sweaty work for us," he said.
The tourists trained in Darwin, in Australia's tropical north, before their Bangladesh tour to prepare for the hot and humid monsoon weather.
"The wickets here are similar to what we faced in Darwin, where it was perfect," Maxwell said. "I think the guys are more than well equipped to handle whatever comes their way in the first Test."
Bangladesh have not played a Test against Australia since Ricky Ponting's team visited the country in 2006, six years after the hosts were granted Test status.
Australia were due to play two Tests in Bangladesh in October 2015 but the tour was cancelled over security fears after a wave of attacks by Islamist extremists in the Muslim-majority nation.
Cricket Australia agreed to reschedule the series this year only after Bangladesh promised intensive security.
The first Test starts on Sunday, with the second in Chittagong from September 4-8. - AFP

Minister Ajith challenges Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to refrain from spreading falsehoods
Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera yesterday challenged former Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to refrain from spreading falsehoods to cover up the truth behind his removal from his Ministerial position.
Deputy Minister Perera pointed out that former Minister Rajapakshe failed to fulfill the promises relating to fighting corruption included in the UNP election manifesto, A New Country in 60 Months.
Perera also alleged that Rajapaksa failed to improve the efficiency of the Attorney General which was under his purview.
Deputy Minister Perera was addressing a special press conference at the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry premises yesterday evening.
The Minister also commented on a statement made by former minister Rajapakshe who said that he was ashamed to have belonged to the present Cabinet. Perera wondered why Rajapakshe waited until he was removed from his position to feel ashamed about the Cabinet.
The Deputy Minister also pointed out, if Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was to resign in shame, it should have been when he made an irresponsible comment on the Hambantota Port agreement or when the UNP Working Committee questioned his conduct.
Deputy Minister Perera further pointed out if Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was really ashamed to be a part of the Cabinet, he should have willingly stepped down from his post without waiting till his removal. Perera also said that he has no personal vendetta against Rajapakshe, but was critical of his conduct taking the country's interest at heart.
Deputy Minister Ajit P. Perera refuted Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe's allegation that the Attorney General was reprimanded at Temple Trees regarding the investigations relating to the Treasury bond issue.
Perera highlighted that no UNP Minister or an MP have ever accused the Attorney General at Temple Trees. He also said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has no corruption allegations in relation to the Treasury bond issue.
According to Perera, Rajapakshe has told media that while he (Rajapakshe) is the Justice Minister, the Attorney General will not be allowed to file a case against the suspects connected to the Treasury bond issue, after the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the case is out.
Deputy Minister Perera also said he is not interested at all in taking up responsibility as the new Minister of Justice.

Firstly, they ask that the subject be placed under the provincial government as part of the provincial transport system. Secondly, they recommend that a National Technical Committee be established to obtain technical assistance in formulating regulations and minimum standards for the relevant industries and to encourage the use of safe taxis instead of three-wheelers as a long term policy of the government when transporting children to school.

MR responsible for dividing party: SLFP General Secretary
Sri Lanka Freedom Party(SLFP) General Secretary Minister Duminda Dissanayake said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was responsible for dividing the SLFP.
Dissanayake was addressing an SLFP meeting in the Anuradhapura West electorate,
A majority of the SLFP supporters voted Mahinda Rajapaksa so that he could become the President for the third time. But, he is the very reason for the SLFP to be divided at present, Minister Dissanayake said.
The Minister also said he would like to remind of the times when former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and President Maithripala Sirisena sat together at the 64th anniversary of the SLFP which was held in Polonnaruwa two years ago. Minister Dissanayake also said that the SLFP will be celebrating its 66th anniversary on September 3.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party has contributed immensely to the countrys progress, including ending the prolonged terrorist war, he said.
Minister Dissanayake also pointed out that President Maithripala Sirisena introduced a new political culture to the country by establishing a National Unity Government in 2015.
He also pointed out that President Maithripala Sirisena ran for the Presidency in 2015, for the greater good of the country. Dissanayake reminded that even then President Sirisena did not step down from the post of SLFP General Secretary, out of dedication to the SLFP.
We would like to remind Mahinda Rajapaksa and his supporters,that it is you who are trying to tear this party apart. But, we do not want the SLFP to lose the upcoming election. I want all of us to stand together, united. I would like to forward this message to Mahinda Rajapaksa that he needs to stand by Maithripala Sirisena at the next 2020 election. Does Rajapaksa have a right to demand the SLFP supporters to come to him and leave another part of the party they support Does it strengthen the SLFP, Minister Dissanayake questioned.
Minister Dissanayake also said the personal vengeance that Mahinda Rajapaksa allegedly holds against certain people should not jeopardise the SLFP.

New lease of life for brick manufacturers
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources State Minister Dilip Vedaarachchi had launched a programme to give a new lease of life to brick manufacturers in the Tangalle DS area.
Those who engage in the brick-manufacturing industry and newcomers to the industry will be helped financially under the programme. A workshop was also held in Tangalle recently, to educate brick manufacturers on new brick-manufacturing technology.
At the initial stage, 150 brick manufacturers and 60 newcomers to the industry would be awarded cash to develop their industries.
Secretary to the State Minister Ravidu Vedaarachchi and Industries and Commercial Activities District Director S. W. Rajapaksa were also present at the workshop.
Meanwhile, brick manufacturers at Mahindapura in the Tissamaharama DS area had been left high and dry due to the lack of water and firewood. Manufacturers said that as a result of strict rules and regulations imposed by the Department of Forest Conservation, the transport of firewood is impossible.
They added that they had to use paddy husk as an alternative, which is Rs. 700 per tractor load.

Onboard Security Operations handed over to Avant Garde on a platter: Navy Commander
Navy Commander Vice Admiral Travis Sinniah said the Onboard Security Operations was handed over to Avant Garde on a platter by the previous government. Elaborating on the Avant Garde issue yesterday, during his first press briefing since taking office as the Navys 21st Commander, he said long before Avant Garde came into the equation, the Navy was running this operation for nearly two years.
We ran this operation completely by ourselves. We had a small company called Avant Garde which was a small security company which somehow managed to convince the government that they could do a better job and the whole operation was then handed over to them.
He said it was the Navy that initially came up with the concept of providing onboard security operations for commercial vessels.
The Avant Garde operation is just a theory. This was a Naval operation and plan. You have to be very clear that Onboard Security Operations (OBS) was brought up by the Navy at the end of the war. After the war when the SL Navy went to various countries, especially the UN, they asked us whether we were capable of going out there and defeating the Somali pirates because we were the most robust small boat fighting team in the world. The SL Navy is ranked No. 1 as the most experienced and robust teams.
He said that when the Navy was asked us how they managed to get their convoys to the North through 30 years and be attacked so few times by the enemy that was so much stronger than the Somali pirates, the Navy had said they had a concept of convoys and a concept of small boats when they fought and had a concept of onboard security teams.
Then they asked us if this cannot be used for commercial shipping and we said of course it could be used. So the concept was drawn up by the Sri Lanka Navy and they bought it. At that time they wanted the SL Navy to come up with a concept and we wrote a paper and sent it to the UN and also had the plan that we could protect commercial shipping all the way from the Malakka straights to the gulf of Aden while providing onboard security teams from Sri Lanka. This was the plan that we had after the war and we implemented it, added the Navy Commander.
Responding to media queries, he denied allegations that the Navy was using weapons seized from the Avant Garde vessel as the Navy have their own weapons.
Avant-Garde Chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi speaking to the Daily News said at the time the Onboard Security Operations were being handled by Avant Garde, it made Rs.320 million per month in profits while under the Navy it had dropped to Rs.100 million, a decline of 70% of the profits. However, according to the Navy Commander, in the Avant Garde operation the Navy only protected the weaponry that went in and out. They were stored in the Navys armouries. All the other services such as boats from and to the ships, entertainment; transport accommodation etc was operated to all other companies.
Today although we are accused of making losses, you must understand that we have only taken back our component of this operation while others are handling the other components, he said.
Senadhipathy while admitting that he had great regard for the current Navy Commander, challenged him to an open debate on the Avant Garde issue and said he had the documentation to prove that the Onboard Security Operations was not handed over to Avant Garde on a platter as alleged by the Commander.
Today, all the Sea Marshals serving in this operation are left unemployed. I ask the Navy if they have provided a single job since taking over this operation. I had provided employment to around 430 Navy personnel and today they are all without a job, added Senadhipathy.

## Title: Paris Accord - What State of the Climate 2016 says
## Supertitle:

Paris Accord - What State of the Climate 2016 says
State of the Climate  2016 (SOC-16) is a 298-page document published by American Meteorological Society. It is based on contributions from about 500 scientists from 60 countries  unfortunately none from Sri Lanka  and thousands of data sets. It was released on line on August 08, 2017 giving valuable information on how forty climate variables have changed during 2016. I have been studying this since 2010 and waiting for 2016 report to check validity of some arguments I have been advocating since of late.
Current day climatechange theories are based on following hypotheses.
(1) Although water vapour is the most influential greenhouse gas in atmosphere, any new water vapour entering atmosphere will not increase the greenhouse effect of atmosphere as it would condense in a few weeks.
(2) CO2 and other greenhouse gases (primary stimulants) entering atmosphere anew spend more time in atmosphere and increase the greenhouse effect of atmosphere and water vapour (secondary stimulant) entering atmosphere to maintain constant relative humidity at the elevated temperature (first temperature increase due to primary stimulants) would stay there and exert an additional greenhouse effect and further increase temperature (second temperature increase due to secondary stimulant).
But these theories are silent about the Newly Formed Water (NFW) vapour arising from combustion of oil and gas containing about 2 and 4 atoms respectively of hydrogen for each atom of carbon (Table 8.1 in Sustainable Energy by Prof. Jefferson Tester, et al). I call this Newly Formed Water because this was not available as water in the global Water cycle earlier. Even the IGSM 2 Model put out by the MIT Joint Programme on Science and Policy of Global Change has not included NFW in its stream from Human System to Earth System. One important aspect of this NFW is that it enters the atmosphere along with CO2 from the same oil and gas combustion and hence will remain behind in the atmosphere.
If you look at, as per climate scientists, doubling of CO2 concentration from 280ppm to 560 ppm, primary stimulant increases temperature by 1.20C and the secondary stimulant by another 1.60C totaling up to the well-known 2.80C increase. My contention with NFW is that NFW acts as a primary stimulant, bringing in a secondary stimulant stream resulting in two sets of temperature increases only.
In 2015, we have generated 43000 TWhrs from coal, 50000 TWhrs from oil and 36000 TWhrs from gas and corresponding outcomes from these along the above line of thought are given below. This is about 4% drop from 2011 for coal, 11% increase for oil and 33% increase for gas resulting in8.0% increase in CO2, 21% increase in NFW to meet 9.6% increase in total energy from fossil fuels. A 21% increase in NFW to achieve a 1.6% decrease in CO2.
State of the Climate  2016 explained on this basis
We intend to explain some of the 33 parameters mentioned in page S2using this NFW hypothesis. This will help readers to assess NFWs contribution towards climate change vis--vis CO2 from the same fossil fuels, etc.
(i) Surface temperature
If we look at possible value for temperature increase based on previously mentioned 2.80C due to a 280ppm increase and 3.5ppm CO2 increase in 2011, we would arrive at a figure of 0.0350C. We agree that (a) direct comparisons cannot be made based on ppm levels of CO2 and (b) as CO2 level increases temperature increase for a givenCO2 increase reduces; but current CO2 ppm level is about halfway between 280 and 560 and if at all it differs from 0.0350C, it could only be much less. But SOC 16 says that the temperature increase is around 0.01  0.120C above the previous maximum observed in 2015. This is in spite of the 11 year solar cycle crossing the maximum (Note Total Solar Irradiance dropped by 0.10Wm-2 in 2016). This implies that global temperature will indicate a downward trend in the next five, six years as been the case with the second half of the earlier 11 year solar cycles, if oil and gas consumptions do not increase significantly.
NFW approach yields a temperature increase of 0.0680C due to products of combustion from fossil fuels and when other effects from deforestation, highway construction, etc are taken into consideration it may be much more. Once these are adjusted for their reduced sensitivities to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, we would arrive at a temperature closer to the observed values.
(ii) Extreme warm days
This graph depicts that in 2016 we have experienced about 18% extremely warm days above 1961-1990 level and these drought conditions were of unusually long durations. Both these extreme phenomena could be more easily explained using NFW than with only CO2.
NFW approach implies there is more water vapour in atmosphere than with only CO2 approach, and normal seasonal changes may not be able to bring temperature down adequately due to this water vapour to condense all the water vapour and bring drought to a close. Anyhow with temperatures coming down more with solar cycle effect, droughts in next few years will be comparatively shorter; unless of course a lot more oil & gas is used to replace coal.
(iii) Precipitation
Precipitation increased by about 20mm (or was it 40 mm) during 2016 in a setup which also experienced a temperature increase of 0.01-0.120C.
When somebody consumes 1 litre (0.8 kg) of gasoline in a vehicle, s/he also generates 1.03kg or 1 litre of NFW (secondary school level Chemistry) in addition to which another three litres of water is brought into the atmosphere to maintain constant relative humidity. This implies that at least 25% of precipitation from oil & gas is due to NFW and this would be true even if this NFW condenses only after a short residence time of a few weeks as suggested by current beliefs. And this also should mean that there will be continuous rain and the mere fact that this is not how we experience precipitation implies that there is spatial and temporal accumulation of NFW in the atmosphere. With the 11-year solar cycle entering its downward half of the cycle, we should expect more precipitation in coming few years which should remind of precipitation and floods in 2010-11.
(iv) Humidity
Relative humidity of the land area has remained within  1.5% level while that above the oceans has remained within even a lesser range. So the assumption about constant relative humidity had been valid. Humidity has increased by around 1% during the year. { total column water vapour has increased by about 0.25mm from the average value of 25mm}. If we assume that additional water vapour has come into atmosphere only to maintain constant relative humidity corresponding to 0.0350C resulting from CO2 based temperature increase computations, the increase in humidity should have been only 0.245%.
(v) Land wind speed & tropical cyclones
This again has been increasing during 2016 and even here NFW would influence the increase more than CO2. If you look at viscosities of O2 (the gas NFW replaces in atmosphere on a 8:9 basis), N2, CO2 and NFW they are in the ratio 25: 22: 19 : 13. The SOC  16 also says there had been 93 named tropical cyclones in 2016 and if you look at the 6 reasons which would prompt formation of a cyclone, 5 of them are instigated by NFW and sixth is a latitude related reason.
(vi) Radiation Budget at the Top of the Atmosphere
SOC Reportsalso show how Radiation Budgets at Top of Atmosphere has changed in that year. I was following this since 2010 and the corresponding changes since thenare given below
Budget Changes since 2010
When Kiehl & Trentberth published their original Mean Energy Budget Diagram (shown below) they made three statements given below. These are important in understanding the Diagram and interpreting the SOC  16 section on this Radiation Budget.
(a) 78 Wm-2 stream due to evapo-transpiration has been calculated as the latent heat due to 1000mm of annual rainfall.
(b) 24Wm-2Thermals flow from the earth is calculated by carrying out an energy balance
(c) In some years the oceans might absorb a certain amount of heat to balance the system.
These changes show that TSI has recorded a negative change for the first time (during last seven years) in 2016. If one looks at normal solar cycles in the past, they generally involve a TSI increase of about 0.5Wm-2 in about 5-6 years; since the cycle has displayed a minimum in 2006, there seems to be an abnormality in this process. Reduction of 0.10Wm-2 in 2016 may be indication that the solar cycle has passed the maximum point. It may also indicate that we should expect increased precipitation in the next few years.
In SOC  2015 document it was mentioned that the interannual variabilitiesare50, 0.20 and 0.40 Wm-2 respectively for OLR, TSI and RSW. If we use these figures for the changes in these three flow rates, the only flow rate which has shown a variation outside these limits is RSW which has shown two positive changes and one negative change. The increase in RSW in 2012  2013 could be due to the increase in surface albedo during the period and the increase in 2009-2010 had been in spite of a decrease in surface albedo. This could be due to increase in cloud formation related to enhanced precipitation experienced in Thailand, Australia etc. Only product of combustion of fossil fuels which could influence RSW both positively and negatively is NFW which could increase RSW due to cloud formation and reduce RSW due to phenomenon like atmospheric rivers.
Coming to the OLR, the parameter has not shown a significant variation according to SOC- 2015. SOC  16 says that the increase in OLR is due to El Nino effect. This increase could also be due to increased precipitation of 20 mm and if we use the same logic as in original Kiehl and Trentberth Diagram increased precipitation could result in an increase of 1.5Wm-2 in OLR.
An overall comment
We have looked at some parameters indicated in SOC-16 and have found that variations in a larger number of parameters could be explained using NFW formed by the combustion of fossil fuels like oil and gas. This ever-increasing consumption of oil & gas will lead to a future where we would be unable to control the ever increasing precipitation leading to many a flood associated with landslides. We in Sri Lanka lost more than 300 lives during the floods in earlier part of this year and India and Nepal are experiencing greater floods killing more than 500 and affecting millions right at the moment. We mentioned about USAs experiences in 2016 earlier. September 2nd2013 issue of Fortune magazine carried 17 photographs of flood affected scenes from different countries showing clearly that precipitation related disasters will not spare any country due to its level of sophistication nor its awareness of climate change aspects.
The Solution
The most appropriate solution for these disasters will obviously be one which would reduce usage of fossil fuels oil & gas and at the same time favourably influence changes in above mentioned energy flows crossing Top of Atmosphere. For the luck of Mankind, there is one solution which fulfils these requirements.
We call this solution Highway Solarisation which meansA dedicated infrastructure for generating electricity for supply to the main grid and/or powering battery electric vehicles using solar energy collected by PV solar panels installed along and above the highways as a solution for climate change
It will definitely reduce CO2, NFW and waste heat from gas and oil combustion
Then there is the case of RSW and land surface albedo. One phenomenon which reduces RSW and land surface albedo is the construction of highways which basically involves reduction in vegetation followed by laying a tarred surface on top of that. Highway solarisation will reduce this and for every kWhr of energy generated and provided to the main grid or a battery electric vehicle, it will also eliminate 1.4 kWhrs of absorbed solar energy leading to global warming.
If our explanation of OLR increase is right, use of Highway Solarisation to generate energy eliminating use of oil/gas will reduce generation of NFW and hence the latent heat. This will influence the OLR favourably. Right now TSI is in a downward trend and if we establish enough projects based on Highway Solarisation during the next five /six years, we could establish more and more projects when the upward trend in TSI sets in, and reduce the impact of increasing TSI on our energy budget.
Conclusion
We have interpreted the findings in the latest State of the Climate  2016 document using a new approach which considers Newly Formed Water (NFW) due to hydrogen present in oil and gas and found out that these explanations provide more plausible interpretations. We have also explained changes in energy flow rates crossing Top of Atmosphere. We have also outlined a solution to generate energy without generating both CO2 and NFW and explained how this solution will reduce the impact of changes in these energy flow rates on Global Energy System.
We are happy that President Donald Trump brought the Paris Accord  enhancing usage of gas to reduce CO2 emissions from coal - to the limelight giving us an opportunity to relook at it. As one could see from the figures given above that would have resulted in bringing more NFW into the atmosphere and this NFW would have (i) increased temperature further when in the air, (ii) created enormous havoc in the form of cyclones, hurricanes while coming down and (iii)created flooding, landslides, etc. when on the ground.
Anybody implementing Paris Accord; yes, we are also building a Noahs Ark.

CSE net foreign inflow Rs. 26.7 b this year:Dr Harsha de Silva
The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has recorded a net foreign inflow of Rs 26.7 billion so far this year, recording the second highest amount in its history, Policy Planning and Economic Development Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said. He was responding to a question raised by Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday.
The minister said the surge in foreign investments in the CSE, shows that the Government has been able to boost investor confidence. He made this observation refuting JO allegations that the investors had lost confidence in the CSE following the Treasury bond controversy.
In 2015, a total of Rs 5.3 billion in foreign investments had been withdrawn from the share market, but in 2016, it received Rs 383.5 million foreign investments. By August 11 this year, the CSE has received a total of Rs 26.7 billion foreign investments. This is a significant achievement, he said. He said the record for the highest ever net foreign inflows was in 2012 and that amount was Rs. 38.6 billion.
The Deputy Minister said a new Securities Exchange Act to regulate and modernize capital market would be brought into force within another month, adding that it would help revive the share market of Sri Lanka.
He said demutualization of CSE, setting up of Central Counter Party, improving Liquidity, introducing Delivery Versus Payment (DVP) system, raising awareness of the public on share market transactions and revising the out-dated laws are other measures proposed to revive the share market. He also stated that the Government did not intend to introduce the Capital Gains Tax proposed from the Budget 2016 to the share market in the future.
It was during the previous regime the pump and dump policy was followed and those black monies were exempted from taxes. Our policy is to give concessions to small and medium scale entrepreneurs, while imposing taxes on areas where necessary, he added.
To hold PC elections on same date:Govt. presents 20th Amendment to Constitution
The Government yesterday in Parliament, presented the 20th Amendment to the Constitution to provide for the holding of elections for all Provincial Councils on the same date.
Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathillake presented the Amendment Bill for first reading.
The Bill also seeks to take over the powers of Provincial Councils when they stand dissolved. The Amendment seeks to insert a new clause to the Constitution stating: the election of members to all Provincial Councils shall be held on the same date and Parliament shall determine the date on which all Provincial Councils shall stand dissolved; provided a specified date shall not be later than the expiration of the term of the last constituted Provincial Council.
Heavy fines for reckless driving or walking across rail crossings:Transport Minister
A fine of Rs 25,000 would be imposed shortly on those who carelessly drive or walk across railway crossings, Civil Aviation and Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
Minister De Silva said that new laws were being formulated to increase fines in this regard.
The minister made this observation in Parliament yesterday, responding to a question raised by UPFA MP Douglas Devananda under Standing Order 23 (2).
Even at level crossings protected by the bell and light system and gates, some people carelessly drive or walk across risking their own safety. People walk across and try to creep through their motor bikes despite the gates being closed. That was the reason why we thought of imposing heavy fine as a penalty, the minister stated.
The minister observing that there were 876 unprotected level crossings, said the installation of the bell and light system would be completed by another two years. Installation of the bell and light system to 200 level crossings is in progress and tenders would be called shortly for another 200, he said.
Govt. has allocated Rs. 100 b for drought hit areas: Wajira Abeywardena
The Government has allocated Rs 100 billion to provide relief to drought affected areas, said Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena in Parliament yesterday.
He said the government was spending the said allocated money and it needed another some of Rs. 80 billion to provide more facilities to those areas. He added that the government also had spent Rs 60 billion to provide relief to flood affected areas and another sum of Rs 60 billion was required for it.
He also said the government was looking for possibilities of formulating a permanent mechanism to providing of relief in the future. He added that the government had a mechanism to provide relief to the affected people. The minister also said that if there are those who had not been provided with relief, the government was ready to address their problems if they were brought to the notice of the government.
He made these observations yesterday, responding to an Adjournment Motion moved by Chief Government Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the drought situation that had affected agriculture and the economy of the farmers.
Minister Wajira Abeywardena said that with the intervention of the Presidential Secretariat, an additional 100 water bowsers had been deployed to provide water to the people in the drought affected areas.
The minister said the government was facing two issues this year. He added one was the drought, while the other was the flood.
"One hundred and forty four divisional secretariats have been affected by the drought, whereas another 95 have been affected by floods," Minister Abeywardena said.
"We have identified that 560,000 families have been affected by these issues."
Govt. mechanism needed to minimize water wasteage: Minister Jayawickrema Perera
There should be a mechanism to minimize water wasteage in the country to address the water issue during droughts, said Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera in Parliament yesterday.
He said the water in Sri Lanka was wasted unnecessarily officials concerned should make the people and the farmers aware of reducing the waste of water. He also said the government should intervene to solve issues pertaining to the farmers , since the economy of the village would enhance, only if the farmers' economy was improved.
He made these observations yesterday, responding to an Adjournment Motion moved by Chief Government Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the drought situation that had affected the agriculture and economy of the farmers.
He stated that they would move proposals at the Cabinet to provide relief to the farmers. He added that the government expects to provide five kilograms of flour to each. He also added that they would also suggest for the granting of a grace period to those farmers to settle their loans.
He added that the government had taken measures to protect the jewellery of the farmers who had had pawned them earlier and the government would take measures to continue the same project.
Govt. should help drought hit farmers to overcome difficulties:JVP Leader
Farmers almost in nineteen districts have been affected by the drought, while their economy had so dropped that the government should intervene to solve their issues, said Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament yesterday.
He said that farmers from some districts had not been able to cultivate paddy for three consecutive seasons. He also added that in some areas irrigation work had not been done properly. He alleged that the government had not been able to solve their problems.
JVP MP Dissanayake made these observations moving an adjournment motion on the drought situation that had affected agriculture and the economy of farmers.
He also said that although the President had promised to grant Rs. 10,000 for those affected farmers in March, it had not been fulfilled. "The farmers in Trincomalee and Kantale had only been provided with Rs. 8,600 at one occasion," MP Dissanayake said. "But it was only in April and had not continued."
He said that the situation was catastrophic. He also said that those farmers had fallen from the frying pan in to the fire, as farmers who go to hospitals are compelled to do their tests and purchase their medicine from private pharmacies.
Health Minister: "Where are the hospitals without medicine Tell me where" queried Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
MP Dissanayake answered that it was in Moneragala, to which the Health Minister responded that he would conduct an investigation against the director of that hospital.
"The Government boasts that there were plenty of medicines in hospitals," Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
"They also say all laboratory services are been provided in hospitals free of charge.
If the government health services is so good, then how come there are laboratories surrounding the hospitals to check urine and blood If the government hospitals have ample stocks of medicine free of charge, how come there are pharmacies around hospitals In the past, we had funeral parlours or casket palaces near hospitals, because the hospitals did not provide the coffins for patients who die.
Today there are private laboratories and pharmacies opposite hospitals because hospitals do not give those services and medicines."
MP Dissanayake queried if the hospitals could offer better services, then as to why the Health Minister took ten million rupees from the Presidents Fund to travel to Singapore seeking treatment at the Mount Elizabeth hospitalAnura Dissanayake also said that while he was fisheries minister, he rented the Mutwal Fisheries Harbour.
The estimate was at Rs 1.7 million per month. But he gave it away for Rs 125,000 for 300 months.
Full days debate on Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill today
Parliament is to take up a full day debate on the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill today.
The Bill to be debated to make necessary legal amendments to hold the long overdue Local Government Elections under the new electoral system.
The Bill will amend the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance (Chapter 262) and provide identification for each ward by a given name and number among other requirements.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha told Parliament that the final draft of the Bill was sent to the Attorney General yesterday, incorporating several last minute amendments. Those amendments are to be moved in Parliament's Committee Stage debate of the Bill.
The minister also stated that he would make sure that the General Secretaries of all political parties representing Parliament, would receive a copy of the proposed amendments by yesterday. On the instructions of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, the minister also agreed to make several copies of the draft amendments available at the Parliamentarians Library.
Meanwhile the Tamil Progressive Alliance members, convening a press conference at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday, said the Government had agreed to increase the number of local government bodies in the central highlands reacting positively to their demands. National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan said the Bill would help strengthen democracy.
The President and the Prime Minister agreed with our demands to increase the number of local government bodies in the Nuwara Eliya district. It currently consists of only eight local government bodies  one Municipal Council, two Urban Councils and five Pradeshiya Sabhas. We met with Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha this morning. He too agreed to include the amendment in the Bill. All MPs from the district are meeting tonight to discuss and come to a decision on this matter, he said.
Badulla District MP A. Aravinda Kumar said that both Badulla and Nuwara Eliya districts were similar in terms of population and geography. Badulla district has 18 local government bodies, while Nuwara Eliya has only eight, he said.

Patriotism at what cost
Although I had given up speaking or writing on politics and politicians since my retirement from public service. Most of my service, I had to work closely with ministers and had seen the deterioration of politics and politicians. The last was a minister who was assigned a portfolio he was clueless about on 1988. Addressing the staff on his first day he said: Do as I tell you and they, who cannot, should find other places. This issue of Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe compels me to express my views dispassionately.
The hottest topic on the lips of every citizen in this country is the call for the resignation of Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe on his loud mouthed call defying collective responsibility of the Cabinet on the question of leasing Hambantota Harbour to a Chinese Company. Here I would wish to quote from an unbiased, professional authoritative economist Amila Muthukutti appearing on one of the English dailies.
Unfortunately, the opportunistic politicians, whose sole objective is to come to power, have mistaken economic matters for political matters, making patriotism a best-selling commodity on the political arena.
It is needless to say that the sale of revenue generating assets is a sin and should be stopped at any cost. However, the logic behind the fact that the sale of loss-making public enterprises has to be questioned, regardless of political ideologies. Public enterprises need to contribute to the economy rather than being financed by tax revenue.
On the other hand, the deal was to lease out the port, but not to sell. The Chinese Company will run the operations of the port over a 99-year lease. The question as to why the port had to be leased out is directly connected with the necessity of debt repayment as the country can no longer continue to finance for a loss-making enterprise. Now it has been proved that Sri Lanka is no longer capable of operating the port in a profitable manner, hence, linking it with an industry leader like China Merchant Port Holdings can be appreciated, as it has an enormous capacity to make it profitable. Accordingly, it can be stated that the necessity to lease it out is timely.
Future generations
In my view, when the period of lease  99 years - is over, the Chinese Company would have attracted more ships to patronize Hambantota Harbour and the government will have a profit making venture to carry on. Let our future generations enjoy the sacrifices made by us today.
It is very unfortunate that Wijeydasa Rajapakshe speaks to the gallery, the hoi polloi, rousing their feelings in the guise of patriotism. One worst call of his was the Maha Sangha to spearhead this call to stop this sale of countrys silver. Let him and all those who gullibly swallow this canard, be reminded the untold damage done to this country by introducing the Sinhala Only Act by S W R D Bandaranaike pressurised by Buddhist monks, without giving him a chance to implement it in a phased manner, getting the cooperation of the Tamils in the North. The irony is that SWRD was murdered by a monk named Somarama.
Reconciliation efforts
Today, after a thirty-year bloody war, there appears to be no settlement although reconciliation efforts and overtures made. Let not economic disaster fall on this country by following pseudo patriots. One other factor he seems to ignore is that inviting the Maha Sangha to support his cause is further deterioration of Buddhism as those monks who have taken up to politics have given priority to political activities neglecting their religious activities, demonstrating in the unruly manner, not expected of monks.
One hidden or secret motive of Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe may be to contest the next Presidential Elections with the support of the Maha Sangha, under the guise of Patriotism. Time will tell.
It is very unfortunate, the government has failed to educate the masses, as to what led to leasing Hambantota Harbour and the commitments of the previous government.
Let me wind up by quoting Albert Einstein Heroism on command. Senseless violence and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of Patriotism  How passionately I hate.

Police search for man who eloped with 15-year-old
Kuruwita Police are conducting investigations to arrest a 30-year-old man who had eloped with a 15-year-old schoolgirl resident in a village close to Kuruwita and sent her back home a week later by giving her a Rs. 500 note to her hand as bus hire.
Investigations revealed that the man had earlier carried on a love affair with the girl despite warnings by her parents who had admonished the girl and told her to give it up. But after continuing a secret intimacy, the girl had eloped with the man leaving a letter behind to her parents.
A week later, the parents had been startled to see the girl returning home. When questioned, the girl had said she went with the man to one of his friends house at Kurunegala and lived together for a week.
Thereafter, the man had given her a Rs. 500 note and got her to board a bus to return home after explaining the route she should take, telling her he had to go away to attend to some urgent work. The parents had thereafter taken her to the police station and lodged a complaint against the man giving his desecration and other details.
The Police have launched investigations to arrest him.

Polythene ban imposed from September 1
Despite protests by polythene manufacturers, Cabinet this week decided that it will impose the ban on polythene as scheduled on September 1.
Manufacturers of polythene, soft packaging industry and other industries allied to the production of polythene, wholesale dealer and traders have made representations to the Industry and Commerce Ministry and stated they will be adversely affected by the ban.
They had stressed that the Cabinet decision to ban a few polythene items immediately will impact 30,000 employees. In addition, they had agreed to introduce bio-degradable polythene and other alternatives if a grace period was given. With these considerations having been considered at the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Economic Management, the Prime Minister on Tuesday submitted a note to Cabinet asking that a grace period of one year be allowed for a smooth switch over to alternatives.
He also recommended that a Committee be appointed consisting of the Industry and Commerce Ministry Secretary (Chairperson), Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry Secretary , Central Environment Authority Director General, Sri Lanka Standards Institute Director General , Industrial Technical Institute Director General and a representative of the Finance Ministry to formulate methods of transition and to aid with the process.
Cabinet however agreed to go ahead with the ban and have the above Committee aid the polythene manufacturers at the same time.

Pothas, Tharanga issue statements on behalf of SLC
The pre-match press conference where the captain of the team presents himself for a Q&A took an unprecedented turn at Pallakele Stadium yesterday with the captain Upul Tharanga and coach Nic Pothas both issuing statements prior to its commencement.
NIC POTHAS
We are in good shape at the moment, a couple of very good training days and the boys are in very good spirits. We are very much focussed on the process of policies and procedures that are in place which would stand us in good stead into the future. That future will take time we certainly cant wave any magic wands around. We are in a position at the moment that England, India and Australia all have found themselves in. We have learnt from them and spoken to them and we are very confident about how we are going about our work. As of tomorrow we just come on and keep on fighting.
It should be stated that I am very happy with everything thats going on within our four walls in that change room and just to clarify things I am very happy with the situation with the Board that has been hugely supportive of everything that I do and the players do and, they continue to support us. Certainly I have no issues there.
UPUL THARANGA
For our bad luck we could not win the first ODI all the players are in good spirits because we have been preparing for this series well ahead of time. India is one of the best teams in the world today. As a team I have faith in the players so that for the second ODI they will come up with a much better performance. We were in a good position at one stage in the first ODI but unfortunately we collapsed. I believe as a team we can do better than that performance especially in our batting.
Our supporters even though we lost at Dambulla were behind us. Their expectations are for the team to win. Its with this in mind that we go into every match and try to win. Every player in the team is committed 100-200 percent to try and win the match. Tomorrows match I am certain the players will put in 100 percent effort and take on the responsibility to win it. We have the support of our support staff and Sri Lanka Cricket is giving us all the assistance. We, as a team are prepared to learn from our mistakes from the first ODI and win. Tomorrows match is crucial for us.

K. Prabagaran the overnight leader by 4 strokes, extended his lead in the Sri Lanka Open 2017, to 7 strokes with an even Par 71, second round in the Sri Lanka Open Golf Championship continued at the Nuwara Eliya Golf Club yesterday. On a perfect day for Golf, the weather was bright and sunny but there were no scores under Par.
Prabagaran, Mithun Perera , B A Sanjeewa and N. Thangaraja returned even Par 2nd round scores which described the difficulty in scoring on a day with great playing conditions. Players commenting affirmed the extremely tough pin placements contributed to the degree of difficulty in breaking Par. Nonetheless, B A Sanjeewa did the impossible by holing-out in ONE in the Par 3, 15th hole.
Pin Fernando Grand Prix
The cut-off for both the Sri Lanka Open and the CAT SOLAR Pin Fernando Grand-Prix, was implemented at 166. In the Sri Lanka Open, 30 players made it through to the last two rounds whilst 20 players made the cut in the Pin Fernando Grand Prix, sponsored by UTE.
The Sri Lanka Open can still have a thrilling finish with Anura Rohana, Mithun Perera , B A Sanjeewa and Sisira Kumara, lined up behind the local hero and home favourite Prabagaran who holds a seven stroke cushion from the 2nd placed Anura Rohana and the other three players a further one stroke behind.

President opens e-Thilina computer lab at Royal College, Polonnaruwa
A state-of-the-art computer laboratory with 20 computers and internet facilities was donated to Royal College, Polonnaruwa, recently under the innovative e-Thilina initiative, corporate social responsibility (CSR) collaboration between ESOFT and Sirasa Television.
The ceremonial opening was held recently under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena who also declared open a new three-storied building for class rooms and an auditorium which were constructed under the Rajarata NavodayaPibidemu Polonnaruwa District Development Programme.
Other distinguished attendees included Dr. Dayan Rajapakse (Group Managing Director - ESOFT Group of Companies), Nishan Sembacuttiaratchy (CEO - ESOFT Metro Campus), Upul Dassanayake (General Manager - ESOFT Metro Campus Colombo), Harsha Ravindra (Assistant Manager - Branch Operations - ESOFT Metro Campus Colombo), Dr. D. S. A. Jayasinghe (Business Partner - ESOFT Polonnaruwa), R. M. A. C. Rajakaruna (Branch Coordinator - ESOFT Polonnaruwa), Sachithra Wanninayake (Branch Manager - ESOFT Kurunegala), Daminda Nissanka (Sales Manager - MTV/MBC) and K. K. Siripala (Principal - Royal College, Polonnaruwa).Expressing his views on the initiative, Dr. Rajapakse said, As the pioneer IT education provider in Sri Lanka, we remain committed to increasing national sustainability by boosting the uptake of technology skills across the country. I feel that this is the only way we will develop our people, businesses and services to meet the standards set by neighbours like India and Singapore. IT is making its presence felt in every aspect of our lives; so, in order for us to progress as a nation, each of our citizens need to be given the opportunity to learn this important set of skills, especially those in rural and underprivileged areas so that they can create better futures for themselves and their families.
Under the e-Thilina project, schools are invited to submit a request through Sirasa Television where they are first evaluated to ensure access to an IT teacher, strong student interest in IT and the availability of space to house a computer laboratory. Once a school is selected, all equipment and infrastructure is transported, set up and configured in the school premises by ESOFT, resulting in a fully equipped lab which students and teachers can start using and benefiting from immediately.
The core purpose of this ongoing community service endeavor is to ensure that every child gets the opportunity to achieve basic IT literacy and therefore, a chance at a brighter future. The very first e-Thilina recipient school was Kumbukwewa Maha Vidyalaya in Kurunegala in October 2014. In the last three years, e-Thilina has donated 28 computer laboratories to government schools islandwide.
As the largest private sector higher education network in Sri Lanka with an islandwide network of 40 branches, ESOFT creates opportunities for over 30,000 students every year.
Founded in 2000, ESOFT today has a solid reputation for delivering high quality and affordable academic programmes ranging from certificate to postgraduate level, across a variety of disciplines including computing, business, hospitality, engineering, quantity surveying and languages.

President pledges to improve Samurdi to meet global trends
President Maithripala Sirisena said the Samurdi movement should be developed as a broad economic and social movement, which is capable of steering the country towards prosperity.
Accordingly, the Samurdi movement will be subjected to several timely changes to meet the present day trends of the world to get the best outcome of the movement, he added.
The President made these remarks while addressing the National Convention of the Samurdi movement at the Nelum Pokuna theatre, under the theme Samurdi Praja Shakthi, yesterday.Addressing Samudhy officers who represented the entire country, the President said the government will provide leadership to the movement to further strengthen it.
Under these measures, small village producers should be empowered to reach the global market.
The quality of small village products should be increased with the assistance of modern technology and methodology aiming to reach the global market. Small level village producers will be supported to reach national and international levels. The aim of the government is to uplift these small scale producers to a global standard and make way for small scale producers to send their products to the international market, he said.
The President highlighted that the Samurdi movement is the brainchild of the 1994 government. With the leadership of Minister S. B. Dissanayake, the movement is progressing, he said.
The President said of the nine provinces, the Samurdi movement is functioning in seven provinces. It was noticed that the movement is not properly progressing in the North and East provinces, affected by terrorism.

President sacks Wijeyadasa
President Maithripala Sirisena has sacked Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from his Justice and Buddhasasana portfolios.
This was done in agreement to a letter sent to him by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Tuesday, asking that Rajapakshe be relieved of his position, the Presidential Media Unit stated.
Wijeyadasa over the past few months has been surrounded by many a controversy created through his own personal remarks over various decisions of the government.
The Minister has not only criticised the government over the seeking of technical assistance from foreign judges in relation to war crime probes but also criticized the recent Hambantota Port agreement signed by the government. The Justice Minister also embarrassed the government by his outburst towards the UN Special Rapporteur Ben Emmerson.
Co-Cabinet spokesperson, Minister Gayantha Karunathilake announcing that the President had acceded to the UNPs request at the weekly Cabinet media briefing said the party resorted to such action because the Minister did not keep his end of the bargain and resign as asked to do so by the UNP Working Committee.
His statements were widely criticised at the UNP Working Committee meeting and it was pointed out that he broke the collective responsibility of Cabinet. At the time, the Minister agreed to take corrective action but he did not do so, Minister Karunathilake said .
Co-cabinet spokesperson and Sports Minister, Dayasiri Jayasekara too commenting on the removal said there was a serious problem when ministers criticised collective cabinet decisions outside of Cabinet.
Criticism must be made inside of cabinet, he stressed.
Wijeyadasa of the UNP however is not the only Minister to openly criticised government action and SLFPs Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha was reported to have said that the government was inefficient and he did not agree with the Hambantota Agreement. The SLFP cabinet co-spokesperson, Jayasekara responding to the reports said, He is not the first or last person to act thus.If need be, we will discuss the issue with the President and see what needs to be done.
One of the biggest controversies surrounding Wijeyadasa however was the lack of progress made in several high profile corruption cases. In one such case, the Chairman of the Maritime Security company Avant Garde though accused of possessing weapons illegally was only charged for money laundering. It was later reported that Wijeyadasa shared a close relationship with the Avant Garde Chairman. Co-cabinet spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne thus observed that a new Justice Minister would revisit the case and take necessary action. Minister Dayasiri however noted that that the SLFP had early on decided not to meddle in the case of Rajapakshe as he was a member of the UNP.
Rajapakshe is the second minister to leave cabinet, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ravi Karunanayake resigned over allegations of corruption. Despite the changes in Cabinet, the both Ministers Jayasekara and Senaratne assured that the government would complete its full term.
No party has majority to form a government and the President and Prime Minister are of the understanding that they would go it together, said Jayasekara.
Senaratne in the meantime pointed out that it was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who had at the start insisted that a unity government be formed to resolve the common issues in the country,
He said that the priority should not be a strong government but to build a nation and solve the national question. Finally we all agreed and we brought the 100 day program. But in six months, Mahinda and his group became came back as fights begin to erupt within the coalition.
This is a hard task but a necessary one. This is the first such case in South Asia. Only Denmark and Germany in the world have such governments at the moment, he explained.
The Minister stressed that as politicians they needed to be ashamed of the fact that for 60 years they have not been able to find a solution to the ethnic problem.

Pressure  was high  for Jackie to play Karisma's role
Actor Jacqueline Fernandez says she was under pressure to step into Karisma Kapoor's shoes for the sequel of the 1997 hit film 'Judwaa'.
In the original comedy, Salman Khan played the double role of Raja and Prem, while Karisma and Rambha played the leading ladies.
The second installment has Jacqueline and Taapsee Pannu in the lead opposite Varun Dhawan.
"I feel blessed to be a part of this film. I have worked with the Dhawans - Rohit Dhawan and David Dhawan (directors) and Varun and they are the most amazing and wonderful people.
"The 1997 film had Karsima Kapoor and I play her part. So the pressure was high as she is a fantastic actress. I hope I have made David sir proud with my work," Jacqueline said at the trailer launch of 'Judwaa 2'.
The actor says she has watched 'Judwaa' quite a few times.
Talking about working with David, Jacqueline says, "You make sure you do justice and give your best. I have followed David sir's instructions."
Taapsee, who has played intense roles in films like 'Pink' and 'Naam Shabana', says she had a great time while shooting 'Judwaa 2'.
"People have often told me I look good in real life. I don't understand if that is a compliment or a comment. I have compensated all in 'Judwaa 2'. I hope no one says this again after the release of 'Judwaa 2'," Taapsee adds.
David praised both Jacqueline and Taapsee, saying, "She (Jacqueline) has done it well, she has done it beyond my imagination. Both the girls are so good and prompt."
'Judwaa 2' is slated to hit screens on September 29. PTI

Priyanka to produce series on Madhuri
Bollywoods dancing diva Madhuri Dixit Nene was surprised when she got to know about the development of a series based on her. She says getting Indian actress Priyanka Chopra on board as an executive producer is a right step.
I was pleasantly surprised in the summer of 2016 when Sri (Rao) said he wanted to do a series inspired by my life in America, Madhuri said in a statement.
The story would follow how Madhuri settles down with her bi-cultural family and tries to bring her colourful lifestyle to an otherwise dull town.
In reality, Madhuri had taken a break from showbiz when she married Sriram Nene, who was based in US back then and shifted to Denver from Mumbai to start a family. The mother of two sons returned to showbiz around five years ago, and continues to be one of the most charming beauties in the Hindi film industry.
Sri Rao, a New York-based writer for shows like General Hospital: Night Shift, will pen the pilot and executive produce the series, as will Madhuris husband.
The Dil Toh Pagal Hai actress added: As Ram and I chatted with Sri, the story evolved and Mark Gordon Productions came on board, wanting to produce it. Bringing on Priyanka was perfect in that she had experience with the landscape.
In June, Madhuri had teased something new and exciting was going to be announced.
Loving downtime in the US. Back up soon with announcements. Till then enjoy, she had tweeted.
Priyanka currently stars on American show Quantico, which is going into its third season. Earlier this year, she made her Hollywood debut with Baywatch, and she is now shooting for romantic comedy Isnt It Romantic with Liam Hemsworth. IANS

## Title: Ranjans take on lawyers and clergy

Ranjans take on lawyers and clergy
One time Sports Minister in the Rajapaksa government C.B. Ratnayake made the famous claim that the most corrupt bodies in the country are the education sector, the police and the Cricket Board, in that order. Film star turned Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake has a different take on the rankings. The intrepid politician, who is known to call a spade a spade, says, in his book, the most corrupt are the members of the clergy followed by the legal fraternity. Ramanayake is reported to have told an English daily that the most corrupt lot are the clergy of all religions and then comes the lawyers. Many lawyers have defended the criminals right from the time of Dr. Colvin R. De Silva, he has gone on to say.
Well, the Deputy Minister is not going to endear himself to the black coated gentry who are bound to challenge his contention. They may have defended criminals in the court, but even a criminal has recourse to the law and the right to be defended. No one is deemed guilty unless proved otherwise and the lawyers too work along this dictum. In other words, the presumption of innocence is the accepted norm in criminal law, whatever the nature of the crime and the record of the perpetrator. If crime suspects are denied the service of a lawyer on the grounds that the latter is deemed corrupt it will lead to the collapse of the courts system and put lawyers out of their jobs. A criminal has the right, as any other litigant, to be heard and it is the jury which arrives at the verdict, with the defending lawyers collecting only his retainer. Hence it is unfair to ostracize lawyers as a corrupt breed, simply because they appear for criminals for a fee.
Dr Colvin R. De Silva may have successfully defended Sathasivam, indicted for the murder of his wife, a crime which generated much emotion among the elite Tamils in Colombo and lost for him an election. But who in their right senses would describe the giant legal luminary as corrupt
However, while defending a crime suspect before a court cannot by any stretch of the imagination be described as a corrupt act, there are indeed lawyers who prolong cases interminably by requesting court for dates, an act which can bleed their clients, since payment is made based on every appearance. It is such manipulations that smack of corruption and Ramanayakes guns should be trained on such types and not lawyers defending criminals.
That said, one cannot entirely disagree with him on his contention that clergy of all religions are on top of the pile of corrupt elements. One has only to see the disparity between some temples and churches, compared to others, to realize this fact. Certain Buddhist monks today openly engage in business activities, especially those in temples in the cities and travel in luxury vehicles. More often than not, they receive political patronage to further their business ends, with some of them even holding important posts in government institutions, an act at complete variance with their primary duty to attend to the spiritual needs of the faithful.
The collapse of the Ceylinco group exposed a long list of, both, Buddhist and Christian clergy, who had deposited millions in the failed venture. One has only to consider the current resistance shown to the government's decision to audit the funds of certain historic temples to understand the extent to which the malaise have taken root in our religious institutions.
Not only that, there are charges of large scale corruption associated with school admissions in institutions run by the Christian clergy and there was an instance where the finger was directly pointed at the head of a leading school, by parents and Old Boys, pertaining to the siphoning off of millions from the school building fund, the details of which was published in the newspapers. Such deeds are not only viewed with disgust but also lead to those among the flock losing faith in their own religion. Hence, the various anti-corruption bodies now probing politicians and laymen should also extend their long arm to schools and religious institutions to scrutinize the happenings under the roofs of these bodies which are run like kingdoms by those in charge.
Welcome nosedive in dengue
It is indeed heartening to note that dengue has dropped by as much as 66 percent in the month of August compared to the July figures and the assurance given by the Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne that there will not be a let up in the ongoing dengue control programme in the country. It must be said that the massive drive that was undertaken to clear the city and suburbs of garbage too contributed immensely in the dengue control exercise. Thankfully, there are no more hospital wards overflowing with dengue patients. Rains, though, are due and precautions should be taken against the spread of the epidemic once again.

Keith Davies, Former Country Director for the British Council, said: The British Council strives to reach millions of teachers and learners of English and to provide them with access to the best resources and latest approaches to English language teaching and learning from the UK. This project is one example of our work in English. We have trained over 2,100 English language teachers in Sri Lanka through the CBB Project English programme with the support of the Ministry of Education.
Mark Prothero, CEO, HSBC Sri Lanka and Maldives commented, Adequate knowledge of English is a compelling necessity to access the many opportunities available in todays society. The teachers trained under this programme use their newly acquired skills and knowledge to create a positive impact in the classroom by building confidence and a positive attitude in students. The overall impact of the programme on these children, therefore, is more holistic increasing their chances of educational and employment opportunities.
Speaking at the event, the Minister of Education, Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said: I am pleased that the Ministry of Education has been working with the CBB and the British Council on this project from its inception to present day. It is an example of a successful partnership collaborating to increase the educational potential of the countrys youth. The Ministry is keen to support such partnerships.
The TKT examination comprises of three modules which focus on the core knowledge and skills needed by teachers of the English language.

Rs 25,000 fine for reckless driving, walking across rail tracks
A fine of Rs 25,000 will be imposed shortly on those who drive or walk across railway crossings recklessly, Civil Aviation and Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said. De Silva said new laws are being formulated to increase the fine in this regard.
The Minister made this observation in Parliament yesterday responding to a question raised by UPFA MP Douglas Devananda.
Even in the level crossings protected by bell and light system and gates, some people carelessly drive or walk across risking their own safety. People walk across and squeeze in their motor bicycles despite the gates being closed. That is why we thought of imposing heavy fine as a penalty, the minister stated. The minister observing that there are 876 unprotected level crossings, said installation of bell and light system for them will be completed by another two years. Installation of the bell and light system to 200 level crossings is in progress and tenders will be called shortly for another 200, he said. The minister also said a proposal has been made to pay an allowance of Rs 22,500 to selected families who volunteer to guard unprotected level crossings.

Scarcity of doctors hinders health maintenance
The lack of a sufficient cadre of doctors had hampered the efficient maintenance of the health service in the Uva Province, Provincial Ministry of Health, Indigenous medicine, Probation and Childcare, Social Welfare and Womens Affairs Secretary Anil Wijesiri said.
He said there were 127 doctor vacancies to be filled in Provincial Hospitals in Uva to facilitate their efficient running.
He said this at a meeting convened by the newly appointed Provincial Health Minister Anura Vidanagamage to ascertain the status of the Health service in the province recently.
Wijesiri said the Health Ministry was a Ministry which needed quick decisions to cater to the needs of the people in the region. It had a cadre of over 110 officials surpassing all other ministers in the province as it concerned the health of the people.
It had to contend with complex situations like dealing with a plethora of health unions.
He said there were 6 base hospitals in the Province. Welimada Base Hospital, which needed a cadre of 42 doctors had to contend with 20 doctors and four out of them had gone on maternity leave. Doctors recently launched a strike saying they were unable to cope with the work due to lack of staff.
Except health staff assistants, attendants and drivers, all other appointments were given by the line ministry. According to 2013 statistics, there was a shortage of 258 nurses and this may have further increased today. A section of the Mahiyangana Base Hospital had been closed.
Although 10 machines were fixed at its Kidney unit, only 4 or 5 were in operation due to lack of staff.
The line ministry and all other sections had been made answer of this situation last year, they asked for 100 additional nurses, but the Ministry sent only 20 after promising to send 75 nurses.
A group of 28 nurses qualified for inter-provincial transfers have been stagnating as they were not released due to existing shortages.

'SL must create dialogue for sustainable development in tourism'
Sri Lanka tourism has been significantly making a remarkable growth since the end of war in 2009.
Tourism has so many impacts for the socio-economic development of Sri Lanka but it doesnt mean that there are no challenges for the nation when developing tourism.
Sri Lanka as a country must create a dialogue to thrive for sustainable development, especially in the nations tourism industry.
In an interview Founder and Coordinator of Tourism Study Programmes at the University of Colombo Dr. Suranga Silva shed light on Sri Lankas tourism industry and the universitys role in its journey for sustainable success.
Q. As you said, Sri Lanka is facing many challenges when becoming a global player in the tourism industry. What do you think are the most current challenges we are facing
A. As globalization takes place, industries are subjected to changes. When we look at the tourism industry we see new trends emerge as a result of global development. Tourism today has become a knowledge driven industry ever than before.
These changes take place according to the passion of the customer and their demands. This means that the trends are vague and less predictable.
Q. You just explained about the global trends but how do you aim to internalize these trends to the Sri Lankan scenario.
A. Tourism is a global product. It is no more a national product. Global trends works more in a one world, one market perspective. Most importantly the tourism industry now has to cater to individual customers that are mass customization.
Mass production is now outdated.No more mass product development with homogeneous tastes, economies of scales are now being challenged. Economies of Scopes are becoming dominant.
2017 is a very important year for the tourism industry. For the first time in known history tourism has become a slogan for world economic development.
The United Nations theme for this year is Sustainable Tourism for Development where they have indicated and connected 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Based on this the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has recognized five areas to be concerned with Sustainable Tourism Development.
They are: (1). Inclusive and sustainable economic growth, (2). Social inclusiveness, employment and poverty reduction, (3). Resource efficiency, environmental protection and climate change, (4). Cultural values, diversity and heritage and (5). Mutual understanding, peace and security.
Q. As a senior academic and the founder of tourism programmes in the University of Colombo what is your contribution to this
A. The UN has very clearly identified the importance of sustainability. In its theme Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development there are five Ps being highlighted.
They are (1) People, (2) Planet, (2) Prosperity, (4) Peace and (5) Partnership.
From the university perspective we believe that we have the capacity and potential to combine all these five Ps into one of the most strongest and well connected platform in a bid to achieve sustainable development.
Q. We understand that meeting such a demand is not an easy task. How do you hope to achieve this
A. Specifically we have an objective to establish a constructive dialogue and strong network among cooperate and business partners, industry leaders, national and regional policy makers, and research and academia in the sole objective of making effective strategies that can take Sri Lanka tourism to the international standards.
Therefore, we expect to organize several events during September and October of this year in parallel with the celebration of the World Tourism Day. These events are (1) Tourism Leaders Summit, (2) International Tourism Research Symposium with participation around 15-20 eminent international researchers and professors (3) Tourism Scholars Quiz with Seri Lankan and foreign tourism training and educational institutes, (4) Dialogue for Empowering Women for Tourism, (6) A survey for the identification of prospects, potential and challenges in enhancing women enrollment in tourism industry in Sri Lanka, (7) Tourism Industry Networking Cricket Match, (8) Tourism Awareness Walk, (9) Tree-planting Campaign.
All these events are focused to strengthen the Five P's of Sustainable Tourism Development.
Symposium will see a combination of Sri Lankan tourism front runners and foreign delegates from different countries.
In addition to these practitioners, CEOs of tourism Cooperate Sector and National Tourism Organizations from different countries will come to BMICH on 3 and 4 October 2017.
We believe that our tourism leaders summit will be the right platform to review a new strategic plan Tourism Strategic Plan 2017-2020 for tourism development of the country.
Q. The local community is a vital component in tourism development. How do you hope to get their contribution to reach your vision of sustainable tourism
A. Yes, if any policy maker implement the UN Sustainable Development Goals without the aid of the community that journey will only be a day-dream.
The biggest challenge we are facing right now is that we have not given the right awareness about sustainable tourism to our community.
These awareness programmes include the Tourism Scholars Quiz that is organized by the University of Colombo in partnership of the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management (SLITHM), Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs.
Secondly, according to my knowledge a major shortcoming of Sri Lankas tourism sector is women participation.
This is especially seen clearly when taken other competitive destinations. Less than 10 per cent of women are actively involved in the tourism industry as employees.
Taking this into consideration we have planned to organize activities to empower women in partnership with the Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs under the guidance of Minister John Amaratunga.
Women entrepreneurship would be greatly decisive for community based sustainable development of Sri Lanka.
Q. Finally, how is the University of Colombo or you involved in tourism
A. I am the founder and coordinator of tourism study programmes of the University of Colombo.
We have study programmes starting from the certificate level to mater level. (www.uoctourism.com for more information.)
Here we have developed a reliable and internationally recognized academic path with the blessing of the Vice Chancellor of the University of Colombo Prof. Lakshman Dissanayake and the Faculty of Arts for anybody those wish to aspire their education in travel, tourism and hospitality management.

SL performed relatively well  WTO
The worlds leading trade integrator has tipped its hat to Sri Lanka on the countrys economic performance in its latest Trade Policy Review (TPR) on the country  the most comprehensive international assessment executed across WTO body of members. In its TPR 2016, which has the final conclusions on the 164-member country review session in Geneva in 2016, WTO says Sri Lankas overall economy has performed relatively well. WTOs previous TPR for Sri Lanka was in 2010 and its (resulting) 2011 report concluded that Sri Lanka (economy) performed reasonably well.
In its latest TPR 2016, the Lankan economy has performed relatively well in comparison to WTOs 2010 economic assessment results, and thus, the results stand as a forceful indicator of positive sentiments on improved investor confidence, lessening policy instability and better trade reform outlook for Sri Lanka.
The latest report is Sri Lankas fourth TPR since December 2010s third review. Sri Lankas first TPR was in 1995 and the second was in 2004.
The WTO TPR is not intended to be an enforcement document but is an indicator of progress made by WTO member countries. Still, as a result of the in-depth country surveillance by the WTO for this report, the TPR mechanism is considered to be, in WTOs own words, fundamentally important activity running throughout the work of the WTO. TPRs therefore impact on a countrys investor confidence, trade reform, indicator of policy uncertainty, and more importantly, WTOs future support initiatives for Sri Lanka.
The new Unity Governments Policy Orientation to 4th TPR session on November 1, 2016, in Geneva, was presented by Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen, who led the eight-member Sri Lankan delegation to the international TPR session.
The fourth Trade Policy Review of Sri Lanka is taking place at a historic moment under the National Unity Government, which was established for the first time in the country by the coalition of two main political parties, Minister Bathiudeen said to last years Geneva audience.
After the conclusion of presentation, Sri Lanka received many accolades, including from the European Union, USA, China and Australia. The Policy Review session was presided by the Chairperson of the Trade Policy Review Body Irene B.K. Young.
The TPR 2016 highlights the countrys achievements at length, and says: Sri Lanka, a middle-income economy, has performed relatively well since its last review in 2010. Its economy has shown resilience in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and following the resolution of the internal conflict, with an average annual growth rate in real GDP of 6% during the review period.

Is SLC trying to suppress media freedom
The Sri Lanka pre-match media conference took a new turn at the Pallekele International Stadium where the media men covering it were asked to restrict their questions to just four and all of them pertaining only to the second ODI between Sri Lanka and India starting today.
Those were the strict instructions given to the media manager by Sri Lanka Crickets executive co-ordinator management committee Vrai Raymond who made a surprise visit to the conference and was trying to control the number of questions that was being thrown at captain Upul Tharanga and coach Nic Pothas who were present.
However despite several attempts to curtail the questions the mediamen had it their way and the conference dragged on in English and Sinhala.
The media were of the view that yesterdays incident was a result of what Pothas had to tell the media at the end of the first ODI at Dambulla on Sunday where Sri Lanka were beaten by nine wickets.
Pothas said that too many cooks were spoiling his attempts to revive the Sri Lanka team.
If it was up to me and we had control over what we did, then we could probably give you a timeline. Its a question you probably need to ask a few other people as well. For me, if we were left alone and you could work with this group of players, you could get some stability and consistency over a period of six months. Youd see massive improvements, said Pothas.
Thus Tharanga and Pothas were required to make a statement prior to the commencement of the press conference.

Keeping in line with the objective of motivating students to pursue their career aspirations, well renowned Sri Lankan Musician and Director of BNS Productions Bathiya Jayakody in his motivational speech said, I started my music production house in a small room. It is fine to start small. We can then rise higher. What you need are commitment and dedication. You must also move with the times. When technology changes we must keep up with the change. Dont think the way most people think; think differently. Strive to do something different. Dream big. This is the right time and the best period of your life so therefore choose correctly.
Whilst improving leadership, communication, team work, problem solving and analytical skills, this event is seen as an opportunity for students to learn how to adapt to the dynamic business environment. Students were also given insights on the current job market and the recent economic developments of the country.
In a thought provoking address, Laksiri Wickramage Deputy Chairman and CEO at Derana said, In the past we learned that our country is a developing nation. Even now we learn that our country is still developing. When will this change Where have we gone wrong If you go to Australia, they show tourists sights that are 200 years old. But they market them very well. In our country we have sights that are more than 2000 years old."

Rivera and Frida showcased in Colombo to celebrate Mexican National Day:
A smile in the middle of the way  an exhibition showcasing the lives of Mexican artists Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, organized by the Mexican Consulate on behalf of the Mexican Embassy, will be held from 1 to 3 September at the Faculty of Visual & Performing Arts, Horton Place, Colombo 7.
The exhibition will feature portraits of two of Mexicos most famous twentieth century artists, Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, providing an intimate window into a passionate personal relationship that led to the creation of unique and enduring pieces of art that have fascinated patrons of art for generations.
Diego Rivera became a legend in his native country for his vibrant murals while Frida Kahlo chose to become a painter after a car crash derailed her dream of becoming a doctor.
Rivera was well known for his murals including the controversial Dreams of a Sunday in the Alameda and numerous other works which drew upon his experience living in revolution-era Mexico and infused with a native style based on large, simplified figures and boldly vivid colour palettes inspired by an Aztec influence.
Popular for her self-portraits, Frida was inspired by Mexican popular culture and she employed a nave folk art style to explore questions of identity, postcolonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society.
Her work is believed to be a reflection of her physical pain and emotional turmoil of her marriage to Rivera whom she divorced and eventually remarried.
A smile in the middle of the way was presented for the first time at Casa Estudio Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo Museum, in Mexico City in 2002 and later around the world.
This collection features images captured by prominent photographers such as Guillermo Kahlo, Peter Jules, Gullimero Zamora, Nickolas Muray, Edwoard Weston and Manuwl Alvarez.
The exhibition will be open on September 1 from 1pm to 8pm, 2nd from 10am to 8pm and on 3rd from 10am to 5pm.

Sri Lanka has earned an annual income of 160 million US dollars by exporting cinnamon products. One objective is to increase this earning to one billion US dollars by 2020, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said. He said his Ministry also hoped to double the export income through other agricultural export crops.
He was addressing the launching of the Ministrys official newsletter Bihidora published in association with Lake House recently.
Minister Gamage said their endeavour was to add cinnamon to the list of Sri Lankan exports in addition to tea, rubber and coconut. He said the government had to develop. The economy while managing the immense debt burden left by the previous regime. The country could be relieved of this debt burden by increasing the export income. The Prime Minister had laid down a target for them to double the export earnings by 2020.
They had to make a planned approach to reach this target. For this they had to solicit the participation of all, including the Ministry and Export agriculture department officials by utilizing new technology and identifying new markets. Today the country earned the largest income by sending expatriate workers abroad. This situation had to be changed because families are torn apart and children became neglected due to sending women workers abroad.

Sri Lankan Ambassador Dr Saj Mendis discusses cooperation in oil, petroleum with Bahrain Minister
Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the Kingdom of Bahrain, Dr A. Saj U. Mendis called on Bahrain's Minister of Oil and Energy Shaikh Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Khalifa to broach and discuss avenues of closer cooperation and collaboration in the sphere of oil and petroleum between the two countries.
The Ministry of Oil, particularly in Gulf countries such as in Bahrain, is considered an extremely critical and seminal ministry and Minister Shaikh Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Khalifa has specialized in the oil and petroleum sector from King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals of Saudi Arabia, the University of Cambridge, Imperial College in London and DePaul University in the USA.
The Minister has expansive experience and exposure in Bahrain, the region and the world in the sphere of oil, energy and petroleum.
Minister of Oil, Mohammed bin Khalifa, is also Chairman of the largest corporate in the Kingdom of Bahrain, which is the Bahrain Petroleum Company, known as BAPCO and the National Oil and Gas Authority, known as NOGA.
Oil and petroleum production is one of the largest components of the GDP of the Kingdom of Bahrain and the rapid reduction of the price of oil, in the international market, has reduced the income from oil and petroleum, according to the Minister of Oil.
He said the diminishing prices of oil would not necessarily stimulate and aggrandize the economies of countries, which are importing oil and petroleum. Ambassador Dr Mendis stated that Sri Lanka expends almost one third of the import bill on oil and petroleum products.
The global production of oil is approximately 96 million barrels of oil per day (bpd). The 14-member OPEC produces approximately 40 million bpd. The largest producer is Saudi Arabia, which produces over 10 million bpd followed by the Russian Federation and the USA.
Minister Shaikh Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Khalifa and Ambassador Dr Mendis both agreed that proactive cooperation and collaboration between oil producing and exporting countries and oil importing countries, such as Sri Lanka, are imperative and vital at this juncture in order to have healthy global economic growth.
Both the Minister and Ambassador agreed that the last World Economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland was overwhelmed by the diminishing prices of oil and its impingment on the global economy.
Ambassador Dr Mendis requested more cooperation, particularly in the context of sharing of technical expertise and skilled employment opportunities to be extended to Sri Lanka.
Ambassador Dr. Mendis and Minister Shaikh Mohammed bin Khalifa discussed, in detail, alternative energy sources which are being explored and developed not only by many countries but also by a number of large corporates.
The Minister also said that any instability, particularly in this region, or any other strategic region could make a negative impact on the price of oil. In other words, the price of oil could rise to over US$ 80 to US$ 100, thus slowing down the global economic growth.
Currently, oil trades around US$ 47 and the optimal price of oil to maximize global economic growth would be around US$ 55 to 60.
Both the Minister and the Ambassador broached the subject of the impact of astronomically high oil prices which were prevailing a decade ago.
In July 2008, the price of oil reached an all time high of US$ 147, which in turn, contributed to a global economic and financial crisis. On a separate note, the Minister said that many of the skilled and professional Sri Lankan expatriates in the Kingdom of Bahrain are doing very well and suggested that Sri Lanka trains more Sri Lankan nationals in technical sectors such as oil, gas, mining, petroleum and engineering, among others.
He also added that most of the large and noted companies which focused on engineering and technology prefer to recruit qualified Sri Lankan nationals, primarily, due to their technical knowhow and competency.

Tax file for all eligible persons on the cards - Guruge
A tax file will be opened for every eligible person in the country in the near future.
Department of Inland Revenue Deputy Commissioner General Nadun Guruge elaborating on the departments plans for doubling the tax revenue to Rs 1,200 billion by 2020, said yesterday that they will be guided by three concepts which are broadening the tax base of income tax, NBT and VAT, increasing the revenue and improving the quality of service to tax payers in the country.
Guruge said last year they had reached Rs 641 billion as tax revenue exceeding the budgeted target of Rs 537 billion and in 2020 they target to double that figure to Rs 1,200 billion.
The expected revenue for this year is Rs 773 billion and up to date they have collected Rs 384 billion, which is a 135% increase compared to 2016, he said.
He also said by 2020 the government intends to change the percentage of tax contribution to 40% direct tax and 60% indirect tax, from the current 80% indirect and 20% direct tax.
Guruge said they treat the taxpayers with much respect as they contribute to the development of the country and the Inland Revenue Department contributes to 44% of the total tax revenue of the country.
He said the tax revenue is utilized for national security of the country, free medical services, free education, Samurdhi welfare scheme, payment of salaries to government servants, payment to pensioners, infrastructure development, construction of highways and the payment of debt services, etc. All these were possible because of the taxpayers who are a dignified lot, he said.
With this plan, the Inland Revenue Department intends to increase the number of taxpayers from the current registered figure which is 1.4 million to 3 million in 2020 with income tax files increasing to 2.2 million, VAT to 150,000 and NBT to 650,000.
Similarly, the Departments services which were centered in Colombo could be also obtained from their 20 regional offices and from the call centre hot line 1944, he said. In the future they will also use email and alerts to keep taxpayers informed, he said.

Tax relief for manufacturers of compostable, biodegradable wrapping sheets - CEA
With the ban on polythene to become effective on January 1, 2018, the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) assured polythene manufacturers that a tax relief will be granted by the Government for those who start manufacturing compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets.
CEA, Deputy Director General, Eng. Upali Indraratne told Daily News Business said the ban will be strictly implemented from January 1, 2018 and requested the general public to use compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets which is the only solution to create an environmental-friendly society in the country.
According to CEA, the compostable sheets degrade within a period of three months unlike polythene which harms the environment
Deputy Director General Indraratne further said although the ban of using polythene was imposed long ago, most manufacturers were unable to comply with the Governments decision due to various reasons.
Now the CEA has taken a firm decision to discuss with manufacturers about their grievances and help them to start manufacturing compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets from 2018, he said.
He said currently about six manufacturers in the country are producing compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets and many manufacturers are exporting them.
Our aim is to encourage all manufacturers to produce environmentally friendly compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets.
When asked about the purchasing of necessary machines that need to manufacture compostable and biodegradable sheets, he said the CEA will discuss with manufacturers about the problems they face.
Referring to a recent meeting conducted by the CEA at Gampaha Divisional Secretariat with the participation of polythene manufacturers, industrialists, sellers and hotel owners about the ban, Indraratne said Sri Lanka is the 48th country in the world to ban polythene products.
He said he informed participants that CEA is always ready to help them to produce environmentally friendly compostable and biodegradable sheets.
CEA Waste Management Unit Director Ajith Weerasundara said using environmentally friendly compostable and biodegradable sheets is the only solution.
According to Director Weerasundara, over 1.5 million polythene lunch sheets and two million polythene bags are currently used by Sri Lankans every day and if we do not stop manufacturing them now, the country will face high environmental pollution after five years.

Taylor Swift announces new album, called Reputation

Exactly three years after Taylor Swift released her fifth studio album 1989 - she's back.
She's just posted a tweet which reveals her new record is called Reputation and will be released on 10 November.
All the photos have also returned to her social media profiles after mysteriously disappearing last Friday.
It's her sixth studio album and led to the hashtag #TS6 to trend on Twitter at points since her "blackout" at the end of last week and this week.
The first single from the album is out on Thursday night.
Tweeting for the first time since hersocial media blackoutat the end of last week, she shared a mysterious video of a reptile tale. The singer continued her social media tease as she revealed the face of a snake in a third cryptic clip on Wednesday.
She followed up her video of an unidentified creature's tail to reveal, as fans had expected, the mystery reptile was a snake.
The latest clip, posted on Instagram and Twitter, shows the creature's head writhing around before snapping at the screen.
Swift fans reacted with joy, causing a rush of glee across social media.
There were a few though, who thought the endless teasing about album news, was too much.
Her last album, 1989, sold more than one million copies in the UK and six million in the US.
Taylor's been a little busy recentlywinning a court caseagainst an American radio DJ who groped her during an interview in 2013.
She said thatby winningshe hoped to "help those whose voices should also be heard".
There are also rumours that Taylor could join Katy Perry on stage at the VMAs this year in a reconciliation performance.

TI calls to table National Audit Bill in Parliament
The anti-corruption organization, Transparency International Sri Lanka, said on Tuesday that the current draft of the National Audit Bill should be tabled in Parliament immediately.
This is focused on driving personal accountability in public finance, Executive Director Asoka Obeyesekere said at a press conference in Colombo.
Many of the things that we have recently seen have illustrated that the publics trust in public finance is at an incredible low.
Obeyesekere said Transparency International had seen the draft of the bill, and believed it upheld the best international practices in public financing.
Contrary to some reports, the current bill would allow the Auditor General to impose personal financial responsibility, or surcharges, on people who have committed fraud or corruption in their public roles, he said.
Our State entities are completely incurred into our entire economy, so sorting out public finance is essential, and this ability to surcharge is crucial, he said.
Obeyesekere also said the proposed law would allow the Auditor General to examine bank accounts, and create an independent budgeting mechanism designed to safeguard the National Audit Offices independence.
The National Audit Bill was initially proposed by Cabinet in 2015, and has been repeatedly deferred. It was a key pledge of President Maithripala Sirisenas 100-day manifesto.
There is speculation that the current draft could be scrapped and re-written, stripping it many of its powers, Obeyesekere said.
Although there are some issues in the bill that Transparency International believes should be addressed, such as amending the appeals procedure to remove conflicts of interest, the bill can be tabled in Parliament and (these changes) can be made, he said.

Twitter and other social media platforms can help track natural disasters in real time and alert first responders of the areas that need urgent aid, scientists say.
With over 500 million tweets sent every single day, new research is investigating innovative ways to use that data to help communities respond during unexpected catastrophes.
While local governments and relief organisations can measure a community's ability to respond to a disaster or measuring its impacts after, they can not monitor the effects in real time. Researchers from the Pennsylvania State University in the US demonstrated the ability of social media to alert first responders.

Weaving  experiences  in Salem
Last month (July 2017) on the second leg of my tour in Tamil Nadu, I took the Kovai Express train at 3.15 PM from Coiambuttur, the second-biggest city in Tamil Nadu, now known as Kovai in short. One of the fastest trains in India, it was heading to the State Capital, Chennai. On the previous day standing in a big queue I succeeded in getting a seating accommodation in the train. However it was overcrowded with people standing, mothers and children chatting and playing. In my segment of the compartment, there were seats for nine people to sit. Except me a Lankan, all the other seats were occupied by one family, while some others of the family were standing all the way because they had not reserved their tickets. They all spoke in either Telugu or Urdu which I did not understand. The Express train was to reach Chennai, but I had to get down an important station called Salem.
I remembered an enclave called Salem in Cincinnati, the second-biggest city (after Cleveland) in the State of Ohio in the U.S. But by 5.15 or so I reached the Weavers City Salem with great relief.
Awe-struck
A postgraduate, M.Phil English literature student and one of my youngest friends, Jothi Srinivasan and her father came in their car to pick me to spend almost 24 hours at their residence, one hour travel away from the station. I was awe-struck. Astonished of their kind hospitality, especially when they had not known me face to face as I was a stranger from another country. Their simplicity and nave manners and their own family bonds made me adapt myself to suit their environment shedding my urban lifestyle and was overwhelmed when the whole family (father mother, expecting elder married sister, younger sister, younger brother, grandpa, grandma, uncles, aunties, paternal grandma all came to see me to welcome me among their midst and showed happiness in meeting me. I was a little embarrassed by their love and genuineness.
Jothi has noted through my conversation with her through the correspondence that I like idly with chicken liver curry and her mother had prepared a delicious dinner for me with Jothi helping her. Although they are doing very well in their family business of weaving sarees for wholesale distribution and well-to-do, they remain very simple and down to earth without any pretence and ostentatiousness. It is this factor that made me love them for what they are. I was moved when they asked me to sleep in one of their rooms on a cosy bed while they all slept in the hall on the floor on mats as they do in outstations in Lanka.
They were all very particular in entertaining with their kindness and fondness and providing me with breakfast and lunch on the following day. I didnt have much time to have a longer chat with humble Jothi regarding her thesis. She will be completing her research on a woman Indian Feminist writer.
Expensive saree
As their custom, they said they give presents to their guests and presented to me and my wife a lovely expensive saree and Veatti and clothing for a shirt. I am deeply obliged to them and remember them always.
Bidding goodbye with sadness I travelled with them in their car driven by Srinivasan Sir himself to the Salem Junction Railway station. Jothis mother, a distinguished looking lady and Jothi accompanied to the station. The Kovai Express arrived on time and I sat in my reserved seat with another set of passengers from various communities in India. The train reached Chennai Central Railway station by 10.30 in the night. Just as the train was a very long one the platform too was about 150 to 200 metres long. I couldnt possibly carry my travelling bag and the handbag and go to the exit climbing up and then down. I sought a porters assistance an old man like me to get me a prepaid cab to my hotel. He was kind enough to do that as it was raining heavily in Chennai that night. I paid him voluntarily 50 Indian rupees.
I reached my hotel in Anna Saalai passing the L I C building, got into my room and slept well.
Big malls
Two more days were left for me to leave Chennai.
Getting up early, I went to the City Centre Mall in Mylapore, a district in the metropolis, to do some shopping. There are three other big malls in the megacity. I only bought a collard Sherwani shirt for 1000 Indian rupees (To know the price in Lanka you have to multiply it by Rs.2.45) and had some bites in the KFC kiosk.
The teenagers seen were all alike as in Sri Lanka in their dress, behavioural patterns etcetera. On the last day, I went to see the owner and director of Madura Travels- a successful travel agency well known in Southern India. He is V K T Balan who had lived in Lanka from his birth until 1981 when he went to India to settle down there. While in Lanka as a teenager he wrote and produced many Thamil plays and won many awards. I gave him a copy of one of my books written in Thamil, which he enjoyed reading. After exchanging past memories with him for more than 3 hours, he returned to his place of residence after dropping me at my hotel.
SriLankan Airlines flight was scheduled at 10.00 am. And I went to the airport three hours earlier.
Reached BIA by about 11.30 and the story ends here.

## Supertitle:

WETTIMUNYS  Role models in Crickets Folk Lore
CRICKET it is said is a gentlemens game. And three outstanding brothers who played the game in that spirit were the WETTIMUNYS  MITHRA, SUNIL and SIDATH. They were role models.
Today when winning is what matters with all the niceties of the game thrown to the winds if not the wilds or hit beyond the boundary with money being the pivot, its hard to find top cricketers who dedicate themselves totally to the core values of and traditions of the game. .
The WETIMUNYS while playing to win, did so with grace and dignity, never forgetting the golden adage that it is not the winning or losing that matters, but how one played the game.
Getting to know the father
As a cricket writer in the then DAILY MIRROR and TIMES, and during my playing days, I played against SUNIL and SIDATH in competitive cricket and had the good fortune of getting to know their beloved father RAMSAY who was a former Sinhalese Sports Club cricketer and from whose genes flowed cricket that ran in the WETTIMUNY brothers --in every nerve, sinew and muscle. He was an Engineer. RAMSAY'S Fair Lady was INDRANI.
There were five brothers in the family, but it was SUNIL, MITHRA and SIDATH who took the game seriously and blossomed and broke out to make waves in the game, administration and being the pride of the school Ananda College which school SUNIL captained.
He later steered the Sinhalese Sports Club to win the Sara Trophy on many occasions and then played for the country. The WETTIMUNY brothers ranked with the three great Australian cricketing brothers Ian, Greg and Trevor Chappell.
Cricket fanatic
RAMSAY their father was a cricket fanatic. And what he did not know of the game and its history was not worth knowing. He was a likeable character, simple, unassuming and always accommodating and who one had to have the good fortune of meeting, knowing and forming a friendship. It was sad that he did not live long to savor the feats of his sons.
The father realizing the cricketing talent in the three right handed cricketing brothers and to further encourage them, he built the first indoor cricket net at the Health Department that still stands as a memory to him.
He saw to it that the sons got the best coaches, one among them being the legendary BERTIE WIJESINHA to show them the nuances of the game and they continued the game with great reverence, dedication and determination. The Sri Lanka cap their ultimate goal.
Punishing batsman
SUNIL, at school was not only a stylish and punishing batsman scoring heavily, but also a wicket keeper of class. But he chose to shed his gloves and took to concentrating on his batting that took him to the top and showing his ability also as a safe fielder.
To SUNIL went the honour of scoring the countrys first half century when he made a stubborn unbeaten 53 before retiring hurt, felled by a Jeff Thomson ankle crushing delivery in the World Cup one-day game against Australia in 1975.
In 1979 he scored a stylish 84 against the West Indies led by Alvin Kallicharan in a Unofficial Test at the Sara Oval facing venomous pace bowers in Malcolm Black Bomber Marshall, Sylvester Clarke and Norbert Philips.
Life threatening
Playing in a one-day game at the SSC after making a gutty 28, he failed to duck a life threatening bouncer from Marshall bowling at terrific pace and was struck on the head.
He was wriggling and was carried off and to hospital where he miraculously recovered. SUNIL had what it takes to be the first captain of Sri Lanka after attaining Test status, but he chose right in becoming a pilot.
SIDAT made the first ever three figure score in Test cricket when he made a big, elegant and determined 157 against Pakistan in the Third Test in Faisalabad in 1982.
Vivid in my memory
This was Sri Lankas first tour after being admitted to the big league. I was the first journalist to tour with the team and had the fortune of covering the series for the Daily Mirror, Times and Sunday Times. That record setting innings by SIDAT is still vivid in my memory.
But SIDATH rocked the cricket world when he became the first Sri Lankan batsman to score a century at the home of cricket Lords. He batted in the style of a Lord, lording over the England bowlers at Lords.
That knock forced cricket writers there to tag him LORD SID a tag he richly deserved. That he missed making a double hundred by just 10 runs was a travesty of justice. But thats how the game goes.
Inaugural Test at Lords
That was Sri Lankas Inaugural Test at Lords and after that magnificent innings he also became the first Sri Lankan to be honoured by the bible of cricket WISDEN and being chosen as WISDEN'S cricketer of the year in 1985.
In that Test where the Lankans made the Lords at Lords stand up and take notice of the countrys cricketing prowess, dusky Duleep Mendis and wicket keeper/opening batsman south paw Amal Silva also scored memorable centuries.
SIDATH played in 23 Test matches, scored 1221 runs, with a highest score of 190. He made two hundred and 6 scores of 50. He played in 35 ODIS making 786 runs with a highest score of 86 not out. He made his Tet debut vs England at the P. Sara Oval in 1982.
Last Test vs India
His last Test was against India at Calcutta in 1987.ODI debut against England at SSC in 1982 and played his final ODI vs India in Mumbai in 1987. He was a member of the inaugural Test team.
SIDATH after quitting the game had a stint as match referee when New Zealand plated Zimbabwe in a Test in Harare in 1997. He was also a selector and the crown in his jewels was when he headed a cricket Interim Committee.
The Wettimunys also had the distinction of giving to the country two brothers MITHRA and SIDAT opening batting. This rare feat unfolded in New Zealand in two Tests against the Kiwis in 1983. Pity that MITHRA could not further motor in the game.
The brothers three SUNIL, MITHRA and SIDATH were role models, sleek and shining much like the Rolls Royce limousines and were loved, respected and admired by everyone and they were gentlemen to the very core. A clan like the WETTIMUNYS enter our cricketing folk lore as each of them is a legend in his own right.

Who writes poetry  to whom
Most poetry teachers around the world teach their students to ask just one question. What is the intention of the poet in his or her poetic creation The response may vary from culture to culture. But there may seem a unity in diversity. An English poem titled Winter written in a cold climate in translation may look somewhat strange to a student living in a warm climate.
But the intention of the poet may be an elevated theme from the mere words. Similarly a poem written about rain by one poet may differ both in the intention and in the meaning in two different ways. A poet may select a common experience of human significance and observation. But he may elevate the commonplace observation to a profound vision. Perhaps it may be a vision in metaphysics or realism.
Poetic structure
I felt the experience in several poems written by the Sinhala poet well known for his diversity in creations, Parakrama Kodituwakku. The poems I read are from his latest collection titled as Mama Vahinava (Im Raining). The poems that I preferred possess two layers or presumably more layers of meaning that go beyond the superficial outer layer of the poetic structure.
One good example is the title poem itself. The rain that pours down from the sky is created as a screen that separates four situations as visualised by the poet. The rain, while pours down, seems to declare:
You had better
Discard the tattered clothes
Just fearlessly move
About on the rugged floor.
I am raining.
The poetic metaphor is extended in several diverse ways.
Cant you bear up the
Burning anger
Within your mind
Will it burst out
Wait, I am raining.
Followed by those lines, there comes the change in the metaphor.
Perhaps there may have been a change of mind.
If you get detoured on your way.
Come back.
Im raining.
While the rain pours down like a screen, the poet sums up the inner feelings one ought to possess in the following lines.
There is no compassion
Nor a kind mind
Leave the so called
Sanctified abode without fear
[for] I am raining
Modern creations
For a moment I felt a certain degree of illuminated bliss. Perhaps what is lost in translation is poetry. The great poet Robert Graves was quite correct when he passed that verdict.
For me, it looks as if the senior seasoned Sinhala poet, Parakrama Kodituwakku, provides ample chances for the interpretation of the modern poetic creations, the diverse imaginative ways that could be utilised in the creative process. He transcends from the mere observation of nature to a profound layer. One example is the poem titled Maha Bandana (The Great Bond). Here he takes a tree as bonded to the earth firmly (reminiscent of the Great Rooted Blossomer by Yeats).
It looks as if the great tree has spread his legs and hands to sky and rooted down with the head to the ground. What does the poet try to signify The great firmness of the great continuity of existence of a bond is perceived by a tree and the earth. But he visualised the breakdown of that firmness at a particular moment. This could well be believed as the break of a great tree that symbolises the breakdown of the intimacy between nature and the earth if taken as a great bond.
The poem is characteristic of a metaphysical vision that emerges from a spiritual vision. Could one say that these are mere mystical entities I dare not come to that conclusion. Most poetic visions lay in spiritualism and higher forms of mysticism. The feelings and visuals that we cannot perceive via sensory means cannot be distanced as mystical.
Creative barriers
As a result of the globalisation of human visions, the influence is felt in several instances. For example, the poet distances his creative barriers from his own cultural milieu and enters the world of other poets and poetesses such as Emily Dickinson. He attempts to recreate in his own terms some of the widely known epithets from other cultures. He treis to redefine in newer terms who a wife is. What it means by boozing, what is a message, what Goutama said, what are books, the way of the pseudo meditations etc.
In many ways, Kodituwakku depicts his own free will in poetic creations. He feels free to address certain characters he had read in narratives. For example, he addressed such a character in the poem Isata Amatumak The comments he passes transcend the mere literary modes.
He uses the poetic compositions at times to dispel the adversities of intellectual dishonesty and denounces the same perhaps in a prosaic form. Thus some of the versifications are admixed into one entity of prose and verse which he terms as gadya kavya or prose poems. He too reinterprets some of the rarely known folklore into a newly carved poetic form. One good example is the first poem titled as Gonun Hathdenava Iskole. The rediscovery of the place where a school is situated makes the poet recreate the age-old tale in a poetic room.
In a symbolic sense, the opem is a rediscovery of the man and the wildlife. The poem titled Kirage Putaya, Kirige Putaya is yet a similar creation of the rediscovery and transformation of an age-old poem in a new manner.
A number of poetic creations centre round the experiences in the teaching profession linked to the remote schools in the country.
All in all, I felt that the poetic forms and contents are made to be fused in order to express the poetic feelings on the various complex conditions of human existence.
I feel that judgement cannot be given on the aesthetic value of poetry. They could be felt perhaps through an inner eye, from which we can see no great things, but even trivialities with great love.

## Title: Why should He

Why should He
If the government of National Unity- which incidentally celebrated its two year anniversary last Thursday- hoped that the resignation of Ravi Karunanayake from the Cabinet would allow it to concentrate on its task of governing the country, it has been proved wrong.
Hardly had the dust settled on the Karunanayake controversy another minister, Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe is the cynosure eyes with his own party, the United National Party (UNP) demanding his resignation.
The dispute over Rajapakshe is significantly different in its context. Karunanayake was implicated in evidence given before the Commission of Inquiry probing the sale of Central Bank bonds. While the Joint Opposition was demanding his resignation, sections of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and his own UNP were endorsing these calls. In the end, he yielded to the pressure and resigned.
In contrast, Rajapakshe is accused of inefficiency as Minister of Justice and it is implied that he is colluding with the JO. He is also charged with violating Cabinet responsibility. It is his own party, the UNP, that is demanding his resignation. The JO is, in fact, supporting him. The mainstream SLFP maintains a deafening silence.
Rajapakshe is certainly no stranger to controversy although a political career that once held much promise is now under a cloud following his recent actions. It is also worth noting that he is no dyed-in-the-wool UNPer, launching his political journey from the SLFP.
Ironically, fifty eight-year-old Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe hails from the same district as his namesake, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who he is now accused of siding with. When Rajapaksa was asked whether he would oppose Minister Rajapakshe, his laconic reply was, Why should I He is from my village.
Young lawyer
Rajapakshes hometown is Walasmulla in the Hambantota district. He had his schooling there before entering the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. He first tried his hand at banking before training as a lawyer. He quickly made his mark and commanded a lucrative practice - a noteworthy achievement since he was an outsider in Hulftsdorp where Colombos legal elite usually held sway.
Rajapakshe may have always had political ambitions but he took to politics only in 2004, entering Parliament on the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) National List. President Chandrika Kumaratunga obviously valued the expertise of the young lawyer fast making a reputation for himself. She offered him the portfolio of Constitutional Affairs. Rajapakshe declined, but remained in the ruling party. He also survived a legal challenge to his appointment by media personality Sunanda Deshapriya.
With the ascension of Mahinda Rajapaksa to the presidency in 2005, Rajapakshe accepted the portfolio of State Banking Development in November 2005. That appointment though was short-lived, as he resigned over differences in policy in April 2006.
Rajapakshe was then appointed Chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprise (COPE), the parliamentary body tasked with ensuring financial discipline in institutions in which the state has a financial stake. This role catapulted Rajapakshe to the limelight. In January and August 2007, COPE under his chairmanship published two reports highlighting various issues of financial mismanagement in the state sector. This embarrassed the then government as Rajapakshe was still in the ruling party.
As opposition demands for action on the COPE report grew, Rajapakshes position in government ranks became untenable. During the vote on the budget in 2007, Rajapakshe put forward conditions if he was to vote for it, which the government declined. Rajapakshe then voted against the budget. Initially, he maintained that he would remain with the SLFP and continue as the partys organiser for Maharagama but it was the beginning of the parting of ways.
Sinahla nationalist
Rajapakshe was invited to join the United National Party (UNP). He accepted and was promptly appointed as its organiser for Maharagama electorate. With many UNPers joining the ruling party, Rajapakshe, along with Mangala Samaraweera were among the few that bucked the trend.
Rajapakshe was fifth in the list of UNP MPs returned from the highly competitive Colombo district at the 2010 general elections, polling over 60,000 preferences. He was seen as a Ranil Wickremesinghe loyalist in the factional dispute that dominated the UNP at the time.
In 2012, Rajapakshe contested the presidency of the Sri Lanka Bar Association (BASL) and won, polling nearly double the number of votes polled by his opponent Tirantha Walaliyadda. As President of the BASL, Rajapakshe opposed the impeachment of then Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayaka.
Interestingly, although Rajapakshe professes to be Sinahla nationalist now, in 2012, as an opposition parliamentarian, he submitted a Private Members Bill to prevent a priest of any religion becoming a Member of Parliament.
At the time, Rajapakshe said the intention of the legislation is for the purpose of maintaining and preserving religious dignity and holiness of all religions but with the only priests in Parliament being Buddhist monks from the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU), the amendment clearly targeted them. The Bill was not passed.
National Unity government
At the 2015 general election, Rajapakshe ran as a UNP candidate from the contentious Colombo district. He polled nearly 82,000 votes and was ninth on a list of eleven UNP parliamentarians. In the minority UNP government he held the portfolio of Justice. When the government of National Unity was formed, he took over the Buddhasasana portfolio as well in September 2015.
In recent months Rajapakshe has been advocating a Sinhala Buddhist nationalist stance on several issues. Arguably, the motive for this could be to carve a leadership niche for himself within the UNP. If that was the intention, it has backfired spectacularly with the party which once adopted him now openly disowning him- a fate that even Ravi Karunanayake did not suffer.
This was not Rajapakshes first transgression. When the controversy over the Avant Garde security company was discussed in Parliament, Rajapakshe appeared to defend the company. So did Minister Tilak Marapana. While Marapana paid the price by resigning his portfolio, Rajapakshe stayed put.
At the time Rajapakshe also denied that he had any links with Avant Garde Chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi. However, photographs later emerged of the Rajapakshe family enjoying an overseas holiday with Senadhipathi. This incident dented Rajapakshes clean image and eroded his credibility.
In more recent months, Rajapaksa has been courting controversy. When the issue of legal delays in prosecuting wrongdoers of the previous regime were raised and cabinet spokesman, Minister Rajitha Senaratne spoke of establishing special judicial mechanisms to deal with such cases, Rajapakshe stated that this would require a constitutional amendment. This was interpreted as a move to try and stall these investigations.
The Attorney Generals Department, which is under Rajapakshes purview has been accused of going slow on corruption cases involving stalwarts of the previous regime and Rajapakshe has been blamed for this. This was highlighted, especially after the Department appeared to act with alacrity into the investigations implicating Karunanayake.
However, what appeared to damage Rajapakshes standing irreparably was when he publicly criticised a Cabinet decision to lease the Hambantota Port to China and claimed that he would not rest until he vested control of the Port with Sri Lanka.
When the controversy over Rajapakshe erupted, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was keen to see a quick resolution. He therefore referred the matter to the UNPs Working Committee. The expectation was that Rajapakshe would make use of that opportunity to apologise for his conduct and resolve the issue.
UNPs instructions
At the Working Committee meeting however, Rajapakshe remained defiant and unapologetic as speaker after speaker admonished him. In another bid to soothe the ruffled feathers, at Wickremesinghes insistence, Rajapakshe was given more time till Monday to respond, apologise and remain in the Cabinet.
The Prime Minister is also reported to have had a one on one meeting with Rajapakshe.
Rajapakshe did not do so. The UNP on Tuesday released a press statement under hand of its General Secretary Kabir Hashim stating that it is requesting President Maithripala Sirisena to remove Rajapakshe from all his portfolios.
Last afternoon, the President's media Division announced that President Sirisena had "approved the request and that the decision has been notified to the UNP and Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe". Thus, Rajapakshe's removal from the Cabinet is now a fait accompli and only the formalities needed to be dealt with. At the time of writing, the political grapevine was already buzzing with speculation about his potential replacements for the portfolios of Justice and Buddhasasana.
It is clear that Rajapakshe revels in this controversy and firmly believes that he will emerge stronger in the longer run, even after losing his cabinet portfolio. However, that is doubtful because, embroiled as he is in controversies and being accused of links with Avant Garde and the Rajapaksa regime, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe is no longer protected by the cloak of incorruptibility. Nevertheless, it can be confidently said that this is not the last we will hear of Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in the national political arena.

Wijeyadasa now says he is ashamed
Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said he was charged of breaching Cabinet responsibility, after he said the Hambantota Port agreement is a violation of countrys Constitution.
He stressed that Cabinet of Ministers have collectively violated the countrys Constitution by leasing out the Hambantota Port to a third party.
Rajapakshe addressing the media at the Buddhasasana Ministry soon after he was removed from his portfolios said the Government has begun selling national assets for a song and he does not want to be in such a government. It is a shame for me to be in a government which is bent on selling public assets, he said. Rajapakshe added that the mastermind behind the Central Bank bond scam is coming to light as a Presidential Commission was appointed by the President unexpectedly.
