Cabinet reshuffle in early January
The National Unity Government is exploring the possibility of its first Cabinet reshuffle in early January, highly placed political sources told the Daily News.
Under the Cabinet reshuffle, at least two top ministers are likely to be transferred out of their current ministries, they said. Contacted by the Daily News, a senior Cabinet minister said a Cabinet reshuffle was a matter between the President and the Prime Minister. "We, as ministers, are not privy to such discussions," he claimed.
However, sources close to the President and the Prime Minister said both leaders were of the same view about the matter.
There have been discussions about possible successors of the ministers who will be transferred out of their current positions, they added.
"There were some ministers whose conduct came under criticism from various parties for multiple reasons. Some even ran into problems with senior party officials.
Decisions made by some ministers had to be overturned by the President and the Prime Ministers, using their authority. This is one key reason behind the possible Cabinet reshuffle," authoritative government sources explained.
Meanwhile, four members of the 'joint opposition' formed by UPFA dissidents, are expected to join the National Unity Government in early January, accepting ministerial and deputy ministerial portfolios.
A UPFA spokesman said the defection of the four MPs would be heavy blow to the fledgeling 'joint opposition' formed to back former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's political campaign.
At least one of the defectors will receive a Cabinet portfolio from President Sirisena, SLFP sources said.

German navy 'rescued over 10,000 migrants' in 2015
GERMANY: Germany's navy said Saturday it rescued over 10,000 migrants at sea this year, including more than 500 people off the coast of Libya on Christmas day.
"The German navy's ships rescued 10,528 people since May 7, 2015," when its fleet launched a rescue operation, the Bundeswehr said on its website.
One ship went into action at Christmas on Friday some 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the Libyan coast, rescuing 539 people on board three inflatable boats and a wooden vessel. A frigate and a patrol boat from Italy as well as a Maltese tanker assisted in the latest rescue operation.
Two German ships are taking part in the European Union's rescue Operation Sophia.
The UN refugee agency and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said this week more than one million migrants and refugees reached Europe this year, most of them by sea.
Nearly 3,700 people drowned or went missing at sea, the IOM said. - AFP

LG elections will be postponed - SB
The local government elections will be postponed as around 2,300 amendments have to be brought to the new electoral system, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake said.
"Specially some electorates of Kandy and Colombo have to be divided into two," the minister said.
Dissanayake made this observation following a function in Madamwela recently. Around 15 opposition parliamentarians will join the government, he said.
The minister said discussions were on regarding the ministerial portfolios that are to be offered to the six MPs.
"The group of parliamentarians will join the government to strengthen the government, the party and the alliance by defeating the attempts to create alternative groups by dividing the SLFP," Dissanayake said.

'Postponing LG election shows President's fear for common opposition'
Postponing the local government election shows that the President fears the Common Opposition, UPFA Parliamentarin Vasudeva Nanayakkara said.
He said that there is no need to postpone the local government election by six months. "It is true that it needs some time to hold the election. But only one month is enough for that," he said. Nanayakkara also said that people's confidence on the President has been weakened.
He said the statement made by a government minister claiming that a team of opposition MPs would join the government is false. "I have no idea about the discussions that are being held to offer ministerial portfolios to the opposition MPs but the opposition MPs do not want to jump into the fire," he said.
