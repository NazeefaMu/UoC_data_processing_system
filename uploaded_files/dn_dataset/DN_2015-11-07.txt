Cabinet gives green light to re-enforce HNDA circular
The Cabinet of Ministers yesterday approved a proposal by University Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella to grant recognition equivalent to the B.Com degree qualification to the Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) qualification as per circular no 46/90.
Addressing the weekly post-Cabinet press briefing, accompanied by Media Minister and co-spokesman Gayantha Karunathilake, Cabinet spokesman and Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senarathna commenting on the police attack on the HNDA students recently, said the circular issued in 1990 had awarded a degree status to the HNDA qualification.
"But, the previous government abolished it. After the new government came to power, the Education Ministry informed the Public Administration and Management Ministry to re-enforce the circular of the HNDA as an alternative qualification to the B.Com degree," he said.
"Since only a few students follow the HNDA course, it is apparent that students participating in the demonstration were not HNDA students. Most were from the same organisation that regularly conducts this type of demonstrations to disrupt the education of students," Dr. Senaratne said.
"The demonstration was conducted on the compulsion of some parties even though we promised to restore the qualification to its former status," he said.
Minister Karunathilake said the Opposition was now trying to say that the Police acted on the government's instructions.
"Police have acknowledged that they did it on their own and not on the instructions of the government. The police used minimum force as the students disrupted peace and obstructed the police personnel from maintaining law and order. We saw how the previous government behaved during the Rathupaswala and Katunayake shooting incidents. Although the former government promised to give a report on these incidents within two weeks, no such report has been released so far," he said.
"Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has already appointed a special committee headed by Dr. B.M.S. Batagoda to probe the attack. We will take steps to release the Committee report as soon as it is made available," the minister said.

DecentLanka 2015 wants Marapana removed from portfolio

DecentLanka 2015 in a letter to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with a copy to President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday appealed for the immediate removal of Minister Thilak Marapana from his portfolio.
The Organisation stated that Marapana's own admission he was legal advisor to Avant Garde chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi and the strong defence made in Parliament as a Cabinet Minister on November 4 on behalf of Senadhipathi makes the government culpable in all crimes, violations of law and corruption that the company and its chairman is accused of.
The letter signed by attorneys at law Neville Ananda, Sujeewa Dahanayake, Srinath Perera, social activist Muditha Karunamuni, journalist Kusal Perera and trade unionist Anton Marcus demanded the Prime Minister to remove Marapana from his ministerial post and all other responsibilities in the government as an effort to at least arrest this slide back to a typical Rajapaksa era.
Excerpts of the letter:
"Appeal for immediate removal of Cabinet Minister Thilak Marapana from portfolio appointed to
We note with much dismay and disgust that President's Counsel Thilak Marapana who was legal advisor to Nissanka Senadhipathi, Chairman of Avant Garde the company embroiled in controversy over the floating armoury and heavily loaded with allegations on illegal weapons deals, violation of law on explosives and firearms, on money laundering and bribery is a Cabinet Minister in your government as a member of your political party brought to Parliament on the National List.
With the January 8 presidential elections that defeated President Rajapaksa labelled and stamped as "dictatorial, nepotistic and corrupt" in your election manifesto and then the defeat of Rajapaksa leadership in August elections, there is no ethical or moral right for you and your government that was voted in with the promise of a "New Country in 60 Months" on a five point programme to include a persons who accepts he was legal advisor to Chairman of Avant Garde, Nissanka Senadhipathi as an important minister in the cabinet of ministers.
Senadhipathi is a businessman accused of serious crimes and corruption and known to have been very closely associated with the Rajapaksa regime. In fact a report attributed to an Additional Solicitor General Vasantha Navaratne Bandara infers charges can be filed against five persons including Nissanka Senadhipathi and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa for 01. Unauthorized Importation of Fire Arms to Sri Lanka under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and Fire Arms Ordinance
02. Possession of fire arms and ammunition without valid licenses under the Fire Arms Ordinance and Explosives Act and then 03. Conspiracy, aiding and abetting to commit the above offences.
Although the AG opted to decide otherwise, President Sirisena was compelled to re start investigations on Avant Garde through PRECIFAC under heavy pressure from many quarters.
It cannot be out of ignorance that Marapana was brought to Parliament through the national list and made the Minister of Law and Order and Prison Reforms. In such context, Minister Marapana's own admission he was legal advisor to Senadhipathi after the January 08 "change" for Yahapalanaya and the strong defence made in Parliament as a cabinet minister on November 4, 2015 on behalf of Senadhipathi then as his client makes your government culpable in all crimes, violations of law and corruption the Avant Garde and its Chairman Senadhipathi is accused of."

Destiny and deja vu for Suu Kyi on campaign trail
MYANMAR: The last time Myanmar held a nationwide election, Aung San Suu Kyi languished under house arrest while her party's landslide win was simply ignored by the country's brutal military rulers.
Twenty-five years later, the democracy champion is free to hit the road, criss-crossing the nation and drawing large, jubilant crowds in an attempt to clinch what observers are hoping will be Myanmar's fairest vote in decades.
For Suu Kyi, the November 8 polls are a watershed moment in a life entwined with the turbulent political struggles of her homeland, shaped by decades of brutal junta rule that only began to ease in 2011.
The daughter of independence hero General Aung San, Suu Kyi, 70, has headed non-violent opposition to the country's military rulers in a three decade role that has come at great personal cost.
Detractors say her reputation as a human rights icon has diminished in recent years as she plunged herself into Myanmar's febrile politics, often choosing hard pragmatism over the idealism of her house arrest years.
But the Nobel Peace Prize winner still commands huge loyalty among supporters of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party and she remains a magnetic force for those wanting to see Myanmar shake off its military past.
- 'Charismatic bonanza' -
But Suu Kyi has been here before and knows well that an election victory does not guarantee power in Myanmar.
Prior to her first stint of house arrest in July 1989, Suu Kyi spent months on a tiring -- and often personally dangerous -- campaign trail.
The NLD's landslide victory the following year was dismissed by a junta that then jailed many of Suu Kyi's allies and kept her confined to her lakeside Yangon home for much of the next two decades.
Myanmar has since morphed from a hermit state into a booming economy open for business since the military ceded power to a quasi-civilian reformist government in 2011. "But two big factors that haven't changed are the charismatic bonanza enjoyed by Aung San Suu Kyi and the enduring grip of the military elite," Nicholas Farrelly, director of the Myanmar Research Centre at the Australian National University, told AFP.
"For many Myanmar voters she is the defining figure of their country's anti-authoritarian struggle. They imagine that the democratic destiny halted in the 1990s is now in reach."
Suu Kyi was born on June 19, 1945 in Japanese-occupied Rangoon -- now called Yangon -- during the closing stages of World War II.
Her father Aung San fought for and against both the British and the Japanese colonisers as he jostled to give his country the best shot at independence. - AFP

If there is light it's a very long tunnel for Windies - Jeff Dujon
The name of Jeff Dujon may not rank as high as that of Viv Richards, Clive Lloyd, Michael Holding, Andy Roberts, Joel Garner you name it, that shaped the powerful West Indies team which dominated world cricket in the 80's but he proved to be a vital cog in their wheel of success especially to their formidable quartet of fast bowlers who played from time to time.
Keeping to such men of exceptional speed was no easy task but over time Dujon mastered the art to become the most successful wicket-keeper produced by West Indies in Tests and One-Day Internationals accounting for 270 and 204 dismissals in both formats.
In an exclusive interview with the "Daily News" Dujon who is presently in Sri Lanka as a television commentator for the ongoing series involving West Indies talks of a wide range of topics from their dominance to their downfall and of their future, if there is any and, makes comparisons between the present Sri Lanka and West Indies teams.
Q: How did you fit into a side like Clive Lloyd's all-conquering world beaters
JD: I got into the team first as a batsman David Murray was keeping wickets then. I was more of a batsman/wicketkeeper. In local cricket I had two good seasons as a batsman before I got into the West Indies team and went on tour as a second wicket-keeper.
Q:How did you displace David Murray in the team
JD: A little bit of luck was involved, I actually made the team as a batsman. I played the first two Tests as a batsman. In the second Test Murray broke his finger and I was given an opportunity to keep wickets in the third Test. I got a half century and well the rest is history.
Q:What was it like to keep wickets to a battery of fast bowlers like Michael Holding, Andy Roberts, Colin Croft, Joel Garner, Malcolm Marshall, Joel Garner, etc
JD: It was that I wasn't a genuine wicket-keeper but my grounding from school was basically to spin so I kept to a lot of spin bowling in school. Coming into the West Indies team having to cope with all of this fast bowling was a difficult experience to start with. Over time I got used to it and overtime I got better at it. I wouldn't say at the beginning of my Test career that I was a good wicket-keeper to fast bowling but eventually with that experience I learned and got better.
Q:How did you find keeping to balls coming at you at 90-100 mph
JD: Naturally it is something that you have to get used to and realize that you have to play through the pain and whatever. But the most difficult thing to adapt to was the fact that they were all different - in terms of what they did with the ball and what they could do. That part of it was for me the most difficult. We had bowlers who could swing the ball at great pace, others who would hit the seam and get a bit of extra bounce because of their height people like Joel Garner (6ft, 8 1/2 in) you had to sort of work out not just how far back you stood but also try to understand their method of doing things. It took a little time to get used to but I must tell you it was very interesting and in the end a very rewarding experience.
Q:Which of them did you find difficult to keep wickets to
JD: The most awkward to me and unfortunately it was only for one Test I had to keep wickets to was Colin Croft who tended when he didn't get it right, to go way down the leg side, but at the same time he could hit the seam and get the ball to leave the right hander. It was difficult and had he been around longer it would have taken a lot more time to adapt to him but with the others they were far more conventional in the way they delivered the ball.
Q:What made West Indies form a battery of fast bowlers, was it due to the defeat they suffered at the hands of Lillee and Thomson in Australia in 1974-75
JD: It had quite a bit to do with that defeat and it was very fortunate that at that time we could put together a quartet of fast bowlers of quality that was important - not just the pace itself because we were 'done-in' by Australia by quality just as much as pace. That experience was the guideline for what we needed to do and we were very successful in the end.
Q:Whose idea was it
JD: It stemmed a lot from Clive Lloyd who was the captain at the time and he saw the effect that this type of bowling could have.
If you have good quality fast bowlers it doesn't really matter what surface you are playing on.
We had four fast bowlers who were so much so different that usually on the day for one of them the conditions would suit him.
Q:Did such a bowling attack shut out the spinners
JD: It did to a certain extent but it's not that we didn't have a few quality spinners in the West Indies at the time.
The emphasis in the team was more one of balancing the batting and the bowling so they ended up with part-time spinners who could stop a gap and give the quicker bowlers a rest because they were the ones who were taking the wickets.
Q: Why is it that West Indies don't produce that kind of fast bowlers today
JD: At that time it was a very competitive situation in the West Indies in terms of trying to get into the team.
We had players who were good enough both batsmen and bowlers. The team was so successful it was very difficult for anyone to get in. In recent times for some reason our fast bowlers have diminished in stature, they are not as tall and they are not as big.
I don't think it's that we don't have individuals of that size more than that there is less interest. The fact that the doors of county cricket were closed to us could be a contributing factor to that and the pitches in the West Indies have slowed down, they don't really encourage fast bowling. Many reasons can be given by different individuals and probably they all would be right.
The fact is that the stature of our fast bowlers has changed and there may be a few things that may have influenced that. Some say the taller fellows have wanted to play basketball or whatever.
Fast bowling is very hard work and we are coming to an era now more of instant gratifications where youngsters are not prepared to work as hard as people in the past.
The reason why I say the fast bowlers were as great as they were is the fact that they worked very hard at what they did. I am not sure that same commitment exists no, to a large extent we are suffering from that not only from the bowling point of view but also where the batting is concerned.
I am not sure if our batsmen put enough effort into it to improving their techniques and improving each season.
Q: What made West Indies want to become the top nation in the eighties
JD: In my time cricket was a far more popular game than it is now I believe. I can only speak of someone who played for the West Indies. In the era I played in it was a very fierce national pride. We took pride in what we did, we wanted to dominate the world, we played together and it had less to do with financial rewards because we weren't very well paid. What we were paid is you could call it pocket money more than anything else. That was the motivating factor. It was the fact that you took a lot of pride in representing the West Indies and you wanted to go there and do your best. You realized that you represented millions of people who were listening. In those days there wasn't that much television coverage, they were listening at odd hours of the morning and that is what drove us the most - personal pride and pride in the fact that we were representing the West Indies. Sentiments of that have been echoed by Sir Garfield Sobers during his visit here and sentiments which I totally agree with.
Q: At which point did the pride start to diminish
JD: When the heart of the team was removed. When a number of experienced players the core of the team was changed all at once. They thought that we could just keep producing these players that it would happen like magic. Just around that time we started to see not immediately but that decline. It's been a progressive situation since downhill. I am not sure if the administration has really understood exactly why is it that we were as dominant as we were and one stupid decision just started the ball rolling.
Q:Is there light at the end of the tunnel for West Indies cricket
JD: If there is a light it's a very long tunnel and I am not sure if we are on the right track. There's got to be some changes made in terms of the actual cricket itself from the grassroots, in terms of organizing all grassroots better, teaching it better, better coaching, and better fundamental coaching so that players don't come to this level as deficient as we seen now. We also need an administration that has a different type of thinking that is willing to build the game in a realistic way and invest in a future.
Q: Being a member of a great team how much does it hurt you to make comments on the present West Indies team
JD: I can tell you that it does hurt because you keep harking back to days when things were so much different. What encourages me is the fact that I do see talent. There is talent but that alone is not enough you have to develop it and you have to learn to manage it properly and to be constantly looking to improve. I am not seeing enough of that but I am seeing talent there and I am actually encouraged by the fact that we do have something to work with.
Q:Your impressions about Sri Lanka cricket compared to West Indies
JD: Sri Lanka at the same time are going through a transitional period I don't think that is going to be as painful as where the West Indies are concerned. From what I can see there is a lot more interest and a lot more organisation the way cricket is run here. They are producing some fine young players - spinners in particular have come in and started to make an impression, some nice young batsmen as well. It's going to be a slightly easier transition for Sri Lanka. I was very impressed with the captain Angelo Mathews he is a very good leader. He is so consistent at international level that he will help to bring along some of the new players of the team.
Q: Has T20 cricket got a lot do with West Indies downfall
JD: It does. Also in the sense the shorter form of the game is providing more financial remuneration to the players. A little bit of focus has shifted from dedication to the game and more to the financial aspects of the game itself. This could have been better managed by the administration but as it is now you can't blame players for wanting to go and earn money and look after their families. A cricketer's career is short but at the same time you have to remember where you are coming from, who gave you your opportunity, you have to show some kind of loyalty where that is concerned.

Islamic organisation seeks Court order against SLTJ
An Islamic organisation yesterday sought an order from the Colombo Chief Magistrate to prevent the Sri Lanka Tawheed Jamath (SLTJ) Organisation from organising an event which is said to be detrimental to religious harmony in the country.
Filing a motion before Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya, the Nabaviyyah Islamic Youth Organisation informed Court that the peaceful co-existence of the Muslim community in Sri Lanka has been gradually harmed by a certain group called the SLTJ, a group extreme and radical by their action and preaching.
The Counsel appearing for the Islamic Youth Organisation informed that the SLTJ has been the cause of problems in many Muslim villages and mosques.
"They have been very critical of the teachings of the Buddha causing damage to the harmony and trust among the Muslims and the Sinhalese."
The Counsel said they have received information that this extremist group was planning to organise an event on November 8 at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium. They said this event is to be attended by P. Jainul Abdeen who is an Indian citizen (based in Tamil Nadu) as the chief guest. They complained that six members of this organisation have a case in court over making derogatory remarks about the Buddha.
The Chief Magistrate observed that he would not issue an order against this organisation since court was not satisfied with the material before Court that the suspects who had been released by court were involved in organising this event. The Court directed that a complaint be made before the Colombo Crimes Division which had earlier commenced investigations against this organisation.

Ministers' statements on Avant-Garde issue: President, PM to take decision

Cabinet spokesman and Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said a special Cabinet meeting will be held on October 9 morning to discuss the controversial Avant-Garde issue.
Dr. Senaratne addressing the weekly Cabinet press briefing in Colombo yesterday, said President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will take a decision on the statements made by two ministers on the Avant-Garde issue recently.
Minister Senaratne said the statements were made without Cabinet approval and stern action should be taken against making such statements.
"Although they said there were no grounds for taking legal action against Avant-Garde, that is not the official position of the government," he said.
The government's official position on Avant-Garde has still not been revealed. The issue will be discussed at the special meeting, the minister said.
He said the ministers' statements were not an opinion of the political parties and civil organisations which helped bring the Yahapalana government to power.
Senaratne said he had the Attorney General's file on the Avant-Garde case with him.
The Attorney General's report has clearly mentioned the possibility of taking certain people into the custody over this matter. The names have also been clearly mentioned. But, there has been a substantial delay in taking action against Avant-Garde perpetrators, the minister said.
"According to Attorney General's Department officials, a particular minister made several threatening phone calls to the Attorney General's Department not to arrest the persons named in the Attorney General's report. After President Maithripala Sirisena came to power, I queried about this case when the National Executive Council held its first meeting. The AG Department's officials said that arrangements have been taken to arrest several people connection with this case the following week. This never happened," he said.
"All of a sudden it was converted to a civil case from a criminal case. According to Attorney General's Department sources, one minister in particular has exerted immense pressure on the Department to go slow on this case," Dr. Senaratne said.
He said the two ministers were appointed by the National Executive Council on the Avant-Garde matter.
"One of the two ministers provided legal assistance to the Avant-Grade owner. The Prime Minister clearly instructed him not to interfere with or give instructions to the Police with regard to the Avant-Garde investigation. I have no personal enmity against Nishshanka Senadhipathi. But, we must always keep in our minds why we have established the Yahapalana government," the minister said.
"Even the President's name has been dragged into this incident. Some media reports published that Avant-Grade Charmain Nishshanka Senadhipathi had congratulated the President after the January 8 victory. However, the President denied this. He said he had no recollection of such an encounter among the large number of people who came to wish him after the election victory. We established the Yahapalana government, but it seems that there are no cases against those who have money and the cases are actually against those who worked to establish Yahapalana," he said.
"Pilleyan was arrested over the discovery of six weapons but no action has been taken against Avant Garde even with the discovery of over 3,000 weapons," the minister said.
Dr. Senaratne recalled that when he was with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, various MPs from the UNP called the former President and disclosed what was happening at UNP Committee meetings.
"There were so many UNPers who were on the pay role of the former President. Some of these people are now sitting with us in the present Cabinet," he said.

Rajapaksa made this remark yesterday when he addressed a pocket meeting in Kadigamuwa in the Hambantota district.
Rajapaksa praised Marapana's position on the matter and said he was a "respected" lawyer.
"The Public Order Minister said some Police officers who wanted to gain points triggered the Avante Garde controversy. He said it was similar to the Millennium City issue in 2002. We all know what happened as a result of the Millennium City revelation. When I look at other inquiries conducted against me, I see a similar trend. Some people are trying to gain points by leveling false allegations against me," Rajapaksa said.

Former govt agreed to grant one phase to China Metallic Corp - PM
Phase I of the Kandurata Expressway has to be constructed under an unsolicited system, as the previous government had entered into an agreement to grant one phase of the Construction under the same system, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
He also stated that the previous government had agreed to grant one phase from Potuhera to Rambukkana to the China Metallic Corporation and the present government has only changed which phase should be granted to construct under an unsolicited system.
"We could not help, except construct it under an unsolicited system as they told us they would sue us pleading for compensation, if we did not give one phase under the unsolicited system," the Premier said.
"Tell us as to why one phase was given under the unsolicited system Due to this reason this government has had to shoulder an added burden yesterday in response to a question raised by Opposition member Dullas Allahapperuma. The Prime Minister further stated that this government would have to pay compensation if it acted against the unsolicited system, while politicians of the previous government received commissions.
"The Premier made these observations in Parliament yesterday, in response to a question raised by Opposition member Dallas Alahapperuma for oral answers.
"Did this government grant construction of the first phase of the Kandurata Expressway under the unsolicited system," Alahapperuma questioned.
"But the then government questioned and criticised vehemently the grant of construction of the Express ways under the unsolicited system."
Premier Wickremesinghe further stated that the previous government wanted to construct a middle part of the Kandurata Expressway. "They did not need to commence the construction from Kandy or Kadawatha. They wanted to construct the Potuhera - Rambukkana phase," the Premier said," adding that it was for more commissions.
The Opposition member stated that the first phase of the Kandurata Expressway had not been granted to any other, but five local constructors had agreed to construct it.
At this stage the Prime Minister stated that the government had to invest money on the construction, adding that those 5 constructors had been selected on a friendly basis.
"If the Opposition says five local contractors agreed to construct it, reveal their names, the Premier challenged the opposition. The World Bank is ready to grant a loan for the construction of the phase which is to be constructed by local constructors. We will open it for all constructors in the country to apply in a transparent way, not like during the previous regime."
Opposition member Alahapperuma had directed the question to the Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella. When Alahapperuma questioned as to what was the cost of 1Km on the construction of the Expressway from Kadawatha to Mirigama, Minister Kiriella said it was Rs. 4.48 billion.
"The proposed construction cost of 1 Km for the 6 lane Expressway was Rs. 4.48 billion under the previous regime. Then the opposition asked was it constructed of Gold," Alahapperuma said. "Now the same cost is proposed for the 4 lane expressway. The people would question if the same expressway was reconstructed of gold and platinum."
At this stage, Minister Kiriella stated that Premier Wickremesinghe in 2003, brought an investor from Malaysia to construct the Expressway to Kandy which is the second capital of the country at a cost of US$ 60 billion.
But the new government in 2005 did not implement it, Minister Kiriella said. If the previous government had the need, they would have done it. But now they shed crocodile tears for the people in Kandy.
The minister further stated the Mahinda Rajapaksa government did not construct the Kandy Expressway, as their government lost Kandy by 75,000 votes.
He said instead, the previous government constructed an Expressway where there were not many vehicles.

Higher Education State Minister to look into SE University problems
Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday in Parliament, said that a Ministerial team led by the Higher Education State Minister would make an inspection tour of the South Eastern University to look into its problems.
He was responding to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake, under Standing Order 23 (2). MP Dissanayake pointed out that about 300 students from the Engineering Faculty of the South Eastern University faced many difficulties due to lack of physical and human resources.
He said the Engineering Faculty of this University was established in 2012, without a proper feasibility study as a quick remedy for the Z-Score issue of the A-L exam in 2011. "Now three batches of students have been recruited to this Faculty, but the students do not have sufficient lecturers, library and other facilities to study. This is an injustice to them," he noted.
Minister Kiriella said he was aware of the problem which resulted due an experiment conducted by the former Government. "A group of students of this faculty met him on October 20 to discuss their problems. After which, it was decided to send a team led by the Higher Education State Minister to make an inspection tour and come up with recommendations to solve the existing problems. Even though we are ready to grant an allowance of Rs 100,000 for lecturers who are willing to go to this university, no lecturer is willing to do so," he stated.

'CEB spent additional Rs. 12,750 million on fuel'
The Ceylon Electricity Board has had to spend an additional amount of Rs. 12,750 million on fuel(oil) on electricity generation as the contracted supplier failed to supply 300,000 tonnes of coal for the Puttalam Power Plant last year, said Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya.
The minister made this observation yesterday in a ministerial statement made in Parliament.
He stated that five tenders have been called since 2009 to register suppliers to the Puttalam power plant. "However, none of those tenders could be granted as the bidders could not comply to the standards outlined by the Cabinet Procurement Committee," the minister said. "Out of the five, one had been cancelled before the opening of tenders. The rest had been rejected by the Cabinet of Ministers, he said."
The minster stated that due these reasons, coal had been purchased from a single supplier without adhering to proper tender procedures during the past five years. He said the coal purchasing process of the Puttalam power plant was criticized in media and there were several court cases pertaining to it.
The minister also said some groups have complained to the Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) and the Special Investigation Commission appointed by the President.
He said further that the Puttalam power plant comprised three phases with a capacity of 900 MW generation. "It has three sub plants which could produce around 55 percent of the country's total power requirement." "The minister said three plants required 2.25 million metric tons of coal an year for its operation. That haul of coal costs US$ 150 million."
The minister added that as the current tender procedure for the purchase of coal was so simple and transparent, purchasing would not be a challenge in the future.

Milco money misused during previous Presidential election
Rs 15 -20 million of Milco Company's money has been misused during the previous Presidential Election, Rural Economic Affairs Minister P Harrison said in Parliament yesterday.
He said the above sum of money had been misused to provide milk packets and yogurt to those who attended public meetings at Temple Trees prior to the Presidential Election.
"The money was spent on 'dansals' at Temple Trees. We are presently taking necessary steps to get that money back from those who were responsible for it. We will take severe action against those officials who had given approval for such spending," he noted.
The minister further said the milk powder production in the country would be doubled by March next year, and it would be trebled by year 2017.
The minister was responding to a question raised by UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana.

Rs. 4,300 sought for Tea, Elders and Vehicle number plates
The Government yesterday submitted a supplementary estimate seeking Parliamentary approval to provide for Rs. 4,300 million to increase the tea certified price, elders allowance and also to provide vehicle number plates etc. The Supplementary estimate was presented by Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
The Plantation Industries Ministry submitted the supplementary estimate of Rs. 1,300 million to increase the certified price of 1 kg of tea leaves to Rs. 80 as promised by the Budget proposal - 2015.
Social Services and Welfare Minister submitted the supplementary estimate for Rs. 1,000 million to increase the elders' allowance.
The amount requested for the Motor Traffic Department to provide facilities to issue vehicle number plates was Rs. 1,300 million.

He requested the Chair to look into the complaint and report to him as to why he did not get the microphone.
The Prime Minister's microphone had been switched off several times while he was responding to a question by Alahapperuma on the construction of the Central Highway. Therefore, the Prime Minister's reply could not be heard properly.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe brought this to the notice of the Chair and asked the Secretary General to submit a report on the incident.

HNDA Protest
Police at fault - Kiriella
Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday said that he also agrees that the way the Police handled the situation during the HNDA protest was wrong.
He was addressing a press conference at the Parliamentary Complex.
"The Police should not exceed its limits. Even the Opposition Leader pointed out the fact that the retreating students were attacked. Now, an investigation is on over this incident.
We have no power to give orders to the Police.
The Police is now independent unlike during the times of the previous regime," he observed.
The minister also rejected the claim that the ministry officials were not available to meet the students who were protesting at Ward Place on October 29.
"It was wrong to say a thing like that. The Police officers who came in to the Ministry discussed with the Ministry officials went out to call five students in for a discussion. However, they did not return with the students, and the baton of one Police officer is still inside the Ministry premises. We are ready to meet the students at any time. We are committed to address their grievances," he noted.
The minister added that Cabinet approval was given to grant degree equivalence the HNDA. "This does not mean that they would be offered degrees, but, their qualification is recognized on par with the degree as it had been the case from 1990 until 2014," he explained.
The minister also emphasized that the University system needs to be made independent for it to be strengthened, adding that the Vice Chancellors should be free to take independent decisions.
"Over the past years, political interferences were abundant in the university education system. This was evident when it came to the appointment of Vice Chancellors. The Universities were degraded to the level of colleges. A university must be a free place to organize various dialogues and present new ideas," he said.
"We are trying to create a new culture. It cannot be achieved overnight. When the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was formed we wanted to include the UGC also as an independent commission, but the proposal had to be dropped as some parties were against it. When we are formulating a new Constitution we will present this proposal again," he commented.
The minister further said the present Government led by the Prime Minister and the President has the will to properly enforce the law in the country.
"We need to build a new country. A national government has been formed to find solutions to the key problems and create the policy framework required by the country. That framework will be a permanent one and it will be our gift to the future generation. The both parties which were ruling the country since the independence are responsible for the national question. We are striving to continue the national government at least for two years in order to achieve the stipulated goals," he said.
Responding to a question by a journalist on the SAITM medical degree, the minister said the matter is being discussed, adding that an amicable solution would be reached through negotiation and careful consideration of all facts.
"The issue of SAITM too was created by the former government. At that time, I inquired from Minister S.B. Dissanayake how a medical college be run without a teaching hospital. Since it has already started now, we have to think about the students who have enrolled in it too. This has been established under an Act approved in Parliament," he pointed out.
The minister also queried whether it is fair to object to the private universities, when students pass the A-L exam and enter the Universities with the help of private tuition.
"Let us face reality. Some of our medical students are studying at various foreign universities in which the standards are below SAITM. Only about 15 percent of our students are admitted to state universities. What happens to the rest of the 85 percent We have to think about their future too," he commented.

USS Anchorage rescues stranded Sri Lankan fishermen

The crew of the amphibious transport dock ship USS Anchorage resumed its voyage back to San Diego Thursday after pausing to assist six fisherman stranded aboard a powerless Sri Lankan-flagged boat in the Indian Ocean.
The Anchorage, part of the Essex Amphibious Ready Group, has been deployed to the Middle East since May.
The 'M/V Lakshan' was spotted early Wednesday afternoon, and Anchorage sailors determined there had been a crankcase explosion that prevented the engines from working, according to the US Navy. "Once our rescue and assist team determined the vessel was dead in the water and 300 miles from land with no food or water, it was obvious that the crew was facing a life or death situation," said Commanding Officer Capt. J.J. Cummings.
"Giving them assistance became our number one priority, and we were not going anywhere until we had full confidence that the crew was safe," Cummings said. "Our sailors instantly flexed from underway operations to mariner assistance, and it was a beautiful thing to watch." The sailors delivered food, water and car batteries to power the stranded vessel temporarily.
The company that operates the boat sent another vessel, the M/V Beyanara, which arrived Thursday. The Anchorage remained on station until the other ship reached the scene. The US Navy said the Beyanara was towing the Lakshan back to land.

Vandersay: on the road to stardom
Jeffrey Vandersay was a virtual unknown until he burst into the international scene with a match bag of eight wickets for Sri Lanka Board President's XI against the touring Pakistanis in a three-day warm-up game at the CCC grounds in June.
Five months down the line Vandersay, a leg-spinner of quality is on the verge of making his maiden One-Day International appearance for Sri Lanka against the touring West Indies side.
With the ongoing three-match series already in the bag for Sri Lanka who hold onto an unbeatable 2-0 lead the chances are that they will be looking to give some of their youngsters a chance to gain exposure against international opposition in the third and final game scheduled at Pallekele on Saturday.
The fast-rising spinner has already made his bow in T20 internationals playing two matches against Pakistan. However where his main focus lies is in Test cricket.
"My ultimate goal is to play Test cricket for a number of years, to do something for the country and kind of see myself as someone who has achieved my goal," Vandersay told the Daily News.
""Test cricket is testing your skill. I like the longer version of the game, I have the patience to play it. T20 and ODIs are good versions of the game, I love them but I love Test cricket more.
"But right now my focus is to get into the Test team and play in a Test match. In order to do that, I will have to work harder. The path that I have taken is correct only time will tell. Let's see how it goes.
"It will be another stepping stone in my career if I make it to the ODI squad, I can see myself going there. But at the same time you also have loads of work to do."
Vandersay believes the breakthrough for him came with the five wickets he took in an innings against Pakistan in the practice match.
"That performance so far has been the highlight of my career. Playing in that match was a very big experience for me. I was very excited to play and I also took it as a challenge to showcase my talent.
"I was kind of nervous at the beginning before I bowled but when the captain told 'Jeffrey you will be bowling from this end' my nerves calmed down. I thought this is what I am supposed to do, bowl like in a normal match. When I took the ball into my hands there was no nervousness or anything like that."
Vandersay's first victim was Ahmed Shehzad who came down the track and tried to hit him over mid-off but only succeeded in giving a catch. However the wicket he prides taking is that of Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq who was dismissed for 15.
"After I took 28 wickets in 6 matches for SSC in the Premier league last season it made the selectors think that I was someone worthwhile looking at. That could be the main reason for my selection for that match."
Vandersay's rise to success has been a steep gradient. After the Pakistan series he went to India with the Development Squad and took part in the Moin-ud-Dowla Gold Cup tournament where the flat pitches with no spin and bounce helped the spinners. But on the subsequent tour to New Zealand with the Sri Lanka A squad Vandersay bowled brilliantly to take two five-for in an innings hauls in the two four-day unofficial tests against New Zealand A thus underlying his ability to bowl on any kind of surface.
"The pitches were flat the only help I got was the wind which I used to my advantage because there was no spin at all. There was a lot of drift and I used it as well as the crease."
To a great extent Vandersay owes his success to Sri Lanka Cricket's spin bowling coach Piyal Wijetunga with whom he has been working.
"Piyal sir knew that I had the potential and the talent and he has always been pushing and backing me. He always tells me 'you have the talent and the quality you need to be more accurate'," said Vandersay.
"That's what we are working on every time we bowl at the nets - the more accurate you get the more pressure you can put on the batsman. He says bowl in one area in one line, draw the batsman out it doesn't matter if you get hit for six in front. A short ball is normal and as spinners we need to cut down on it. Every time a four goes you will lose the pressure.
""As a leg spinner you always want the ball to turn, that gives you loads of confidence especially when you see a turning track, but you rarely get turning tracks now so you have to be adapt and be good enough to bowl on any type of pitch."
Initially when he started Vandersay said he had only the googly. "I used to bowl it in three ways but one of my coaches said to master one, which I did."
Apart from the leg break Vandersay bowls the googly a lot and keeps the top spinner mainly for the longer game. For ODIs and T20Is he bowls the slider, the quicker one which contains runs.
What Vandersay has learnt from the great Shane Warne by watching videos of him is that as a leg spinner you have to spin the ball, if you don't there's no point in being one.
Vandersay's coach Piyal Wijetunga said, "He is our future. He is a conventional type of leg-spinner and we should preserve him for Test cricket, not for ODIs and T20Is. He needs a lot more experience and must be given every opportunity to play with the Sri Lanka A team."
The 25-year-old trundler was only 15 when he made it to the first eleven cricket team at Wesley College, In the season 2007-08 he took 35 wickets from 10 matches and also captained the school in five matches when appointed captain Ryan Kern was called up for national duty with the Sri Lanka under 19 team. "I used to be a bowler who was not accurate even though I loved playing cricket and loved bowling."
Vandersay of Dutch origin had to wait until his brother Arnold had stopped playing cricket for Wesley to begin his career because they needed someone to tend to their sick father who suffered from diabetes. Although employed in Qatar, Arnold became the breadwinner of the family following the death of their father ten years ago.
Vandersay who is unemployed at the moment said that he was first came under the eyes of Sri Lanka Cricket coaches when he was picked among the best five bowlers from his school and sent for training.
"Because I was small they didn't show much interest in me and I dropped off and went to England to play a season of cricket with Grampound CC in the Cornwall league. On my return I joined Seeduwa-Raddoluwa CC and had a very good season. I took 50 wickets in 9 matches in the Premier League and that's where actually everything kicked off. The coaches started to show interest in me wanting to find out who I was. They invited me to become a net bowler for the national team," said Vandersay.
But it was not until he joined SSC halfway through the 2014-15 season that he got the big break that was to change his career. In his first match for them against Sri Lanka Army Vandersay took seven wickets and was subsequently selected to play for Board President's XI against Pakistan. The rest of the journey from there onwards has been a fairytale.

Jeffrey Vandersay
Jeffrey Vandersay captained Wesley after a number of senior players were suspended following disciplinary action taken by the school principal MAP Fernando. This was meant to be detrimental to the school records but the contrary happened. Leading a team of boys from the Under 17 and Under 15 teams Jeff managed to get the best possible results. From this team Wesley were able to build a strong reputation - a blood and guts reputation with players like Danny Bartholomeusz, Ranindu Suriyakumara and Ashan Fonseka shining that season. They were good enough for the Warden of S. Thomas' David Ponniah (a former Thomian opening batting star) to pay them many compliments. Danny was the mainstay and had a coach who believed in his job. He was Jerry Woutersz an international cricketer and a team mate of mine at the BRC.
However interference from a section of the old boys from cockpits of yesteryear caused Jerry to walk off.
Jeffrey is now making great inroads but unlike Farveez Maharoof he has not got the publicity he deserves. I would like to ask all of you to open the Cricinfo website choose "Sri Lanka" and give Jeff a like. I know him as an unassuming cricketer who was always hungry for a chinese roll.
Peter Casie Chetty

Readers viewpoint
I met Farveez Maharoof at Kumar Sangakkaras last Test match at the Sara Oval. He was very happy and praised the performances of Wesleys Jeffrey Vandersay. Vandersay got a lot of publicity when he took a lot of wickets against Pakistan and when he played one-day international for SL. Not fair to state that Jeffrey unlike Farveez has not got the publicity he deserves.
Farveez captained Sri Lanka U19s and was the only Wesleyite to do so. He played a lot of Test/One-day/Indian Premier League cricket so obviously got more publicity. Agree to your comments about Jerry Woutersz. Some even tried to educate Wesley cricket traditions to Jerry. I wonder what those traditions are. LOL.

Windies look for redemption with Holder's return

West Indies will welcome the return of their captain Jason Holder for the third and final one-day international at the Pallekele Stadium today.
Holder sat out the second ODI played at the R Premadasa Stadium on Wednesday following an ICC suspension for his team's slow over rate, and saw West Indies lose to Sri Lanka by eight wickets on the D/L rule.
The result gave Sri Lanka a winning 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
Today's game as the first two is likely to be affected by bad weather and West Indies with the return of their captain will be looking to salvage something out of a lost series. They also lost the two-Test series to Sri Lanka 2-0.
"There is rain around so we will have to watch that, but once we get a chance to play we will be giving all we got," said Holder at the pre-match press conference.
"We have left Colombo and come here to Kandy so we hope the change will bring a better result," the 24-year-old allrounder said.
"Every match is important. We need to win tomorrow... we are also looking at the bigger picture, and every match has points attached to it. So we need to win to get points and looking to move up the (ICC One-Day) rankings table."
Sri Lanka are not looking to make any big changes but skipper Angelo Mathews hinted that leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay may be given a chance to make his ODI debut at the expense of one of the spinners.
