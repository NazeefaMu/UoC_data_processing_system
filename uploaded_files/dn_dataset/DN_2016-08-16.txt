Bourne not Bond!
Theres an action sequence in Jason Bourne that is a thing of such cinematic beauty that nothing the director Paul Greengrass could have shown later on would have made me regret watching the film. In the sequences, the tension is first slowly allowed to simmer, as youre familiarised with the settingin this case, a civil war in Greece. The police are ready with their bullets and barricades, the rioters with their molotov cocktails. Nicki Parsons (Julia Stiles), meanwhile, has a bomb of her own to drop on Bourne (Matt Damon) specifically about his past. The situation is now boiling. It is also at this time that CIAs corrupt head, Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones), has arranged for an asset to close Bournes account (thats CIA speak for assassination). And then, it all explodes into the frenzied, pulsating action that we have come to love in the Bourne films. In its refusal to rely mainly on CGI, this entire sequence is a throwback to good ol fashioned action.
The story alsodespite the attempts at retrofitting by bringing in the Edward Snowden angle and CIAs ever-looming threat of privacy invasion (the riots in Greece ring all the more relevant, as the country is after all the birthplace of democracy)harks back to the old Bourne films, all of whose plots can be simply described thus: Bourne resurfaces from hiding to learn more about his past before going off the radar again. Quite ironically though, this film begins with Bourne saying, I remember everything, the same line he utters at the end of The Bourne Ultimatum, directed by Greengrass himself.
But as Nicki helps him see in Jason Bourne, memory and knowledge are two different things, and he still has a lot to know about himself and his father.
The problem though is that the lack of this knowledge doesnt really make him seem vulnerable, and Ive always liked him the most when hes in doubt... when hes human. Like in the opening scene of The Bourne Identity, when he wakes up riddled by bullets and without any memory of his past. However, once that engrossing sequence in Greece gets over and with it, his relationship with Nicki, Bourne almost becomes insuperable. You almost begin to feel sorry for all the assassins sent to take him down.
The emotional beats disappear too. His relationship with his dad isnt really established well for you to feel any sense of loss. And in any case, it was his dad who put the whole chain of events in motion, making it hard for you to relate to Bournes sense of revenge. More interesting is the power struggle between Dewey and Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander), an ambitious CIA agent.
I enjoyed that you could never tell what Heathers motivation is. Is she playing the game because she likes Bourne, or is she interested in furthering her career Or wait, perhaps shes in it for the good of the world, and simply wants to stop Iron Hand, the upcoming invasive CIA program thatd give it access to omnipresent surveillance tools. Iornically enough, CIA seems scarily invasive even without the new program, be it using a traffic camera in Germany to watch Bourne, or controlling a satellite to learn about Bournes movements in Greece.

Dragons ignite the screen
A re-imagining of Disneys cherished family film,  Petes Dragon is the adventure of an orphaned boy named Pete and his best friend Elliott, who just so happens to be a dragon. Petes Dragon stars Bryce Dallas Howard (Jurassic World), Oakes Fegley (This is where I leave you) Wes Bentley (The Hunger Games), Karl Urban (Star Trek), Oona Laurence (Southpaw), and Oscar winner Robert Redford (Captain America). For years, old wood carver Mr. Meacham (Robert Redford) has delighted local children with his tales of the fierce dragon that resides deep in the woods of the Pacific Northwest. To his daughter, Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), who works as a forest ranger, these stories are little more than tall tales until she meets Pete (Oakes Fegley). Pete is a mysterious 10-year old with no family and no home who claims to live in the woods with a giant, a green dragon named Elliott. From Petes descriptions, Elliott seems remarkably similar to the dragon from Mr. Meachams stories. Grace sets out to determine where Pete came from, where he belongs and the truth about this dragon.
Petes Dragon will be screened by Ceylon Theatres at Majestic Cineplex 10.30 am, 1.30 pm, 4.30 pm, 7.30 pm Fri/Sat 10.30 pm and Empire Cineplex 10.30 am, 1.30 pm, 4.30 pm, 7.30 pm, Fri/Sat 10.30 pm.

Ben-Hur reboot is a completely different movie than 1959 original
Mark Burnett and Roma Downey are well-known for fearlessly taking on compelling, if potentially controversial, projects, including The Bible, their 2013 landmark docudrama. Next up is their reboot of the 1959 multiple Oscar-winning epic, Ben-Hur, helmed by William Wyler and starring Charlton Heston. Downey and Burnett serve as executive producers on the new .Ben-Hur, which bows in theaters Augugust 19.
Keith R. Clarke and John Ridley penned the screenplay for the MGM and Paramount Studios film, directed by Russian-Kazakh helmer Timur Bekmambetov.
In Wylers version, which won 11 Oscars, Judah Ben-Hur (Heston) is a wealthy Jewish merchant living in Jerusalem at the turn of the 1st century. He is betrayed by his childhood friend, Messala, now a Roman nobleman. Ben-Hur is tossed into prison and, ultimately, seeks revenge.
The updated Ben-Hur will provide plenty of new surprises, says Bekmambetov.
This is a completely different movie, based on a different script, with a different idea at its core, he says. Bekmambetovs Ben-Hur centers on a prince falsely accused of treason, who regains his freedom and returns for revenge. Both storywise and tonally, Bekmambetov says, the film hews close to Lew Wallaces original novel (upon which both films are based), but also sends a new message.
The world has changed a lot and the revenge theme that was used in the 1959 film feels even more visceral in todays world, Bekmambetov says. Our film emphasizes instead the importance of forgiveness.
The director credits Downey with helping him deal with the sort of on-set challenges that typically pop up during the filming of any movie, including maintaining the films core emotional thrust.
Shes not only a professional producer, but also a good-hearted person, he says. Roma has the unique gift of hearing other people and making sure they hear her.
That was one of the reasons we managed to maintain the emotional centerpiece of the movie. All the decisions she made were both emotional and well-balanced. Her sincerity inspired me and gave me the confidence that we were on the right track.

Ben Hur will be releasing on August 19 at Savoy, Excel, Liberty Lite, Vista Lite, Cine City, Sky Lights Malabe,NIT  Ratnapura, NIT- Kurunagala and SkyLite - Matara

Katy Perry ready for pop comeback
Katy Perry is ready to regain her status as the biggest thing in pop music.
The singer released her fourth album Prism in 2013, which offered up dance hits such as Roar and Dark Horse. Following the end of her headlining world tour in 2014, which grossed $204 million (157 million) worldwide, Katy has been enjoying an extended break, carefully selecting her appearances, such as the NFL Super Bowl halftime show in February last year (15).
But the 31-year-old has been working on music since May (16), and is apparently ready to get back into the spotlight full time.
Katy loves performing, so a large part of 2017 is already put aside for a huge world tour, a source told Britains Heat magazine. Shes ready to be back and be the biggest thing in pop.
While Katy recorded an anthem for the 2016 Summer Olympics called Rise, which was released last month (Jul16), it will apparently be a standalone track, and wont feature on her upcoming album.
But fans shouldnt have to wait too long to get their dose of pop tunes from the megastar. Her new album will be out in October or November, and the industry is really excited about it, the insider added. Meanwhile, Katy is apparently on a high following a relaxing getaway with her actor beau Orlando Bloom. The Firework singer and the 39-year-old star were spotted enjoying some time together while on vacation in Sardinia, Italy, recently. The two were spotted laughing and holding hands during their beach day, the latest destination date for the couple who began dating earlier this year (16). And being with Orlando has greatly benefited Katy, who has had tumultuous relationships in the past with the likes of John Mayer and ex-husband Russell Brand. - Music-News

No intl interference or foreign judges
There will be no international interference or no foreign judges be appointed to the panel to inquire into missing persons as alleged by certain groups, UNP Colombo District MP S. M. Marikkar said.
However, International inspectors are welcome to arrive in the country to witness the transparency and the progress of the investigations, he said while addressing a media briefing at UNP Headquarters - Sirikotha yesterday.
A bad image was created internationally about our war heroes. There are a million tri forces and police personnel in the country. But they all have been accused of human rights violations by the international community due to wrong doings committed by a few. Therefore if those who had committed the crimes are brought before the law and justice meted out it will erase the black mark internationally on our security establishment. At the same time this will bring glory to the security forces from the international community and re-establish their recognition among the international community.
Marikkar said that the governments move to set up an office to inquire into the missing will not be limited to find about those who went missing during the civil war, but to inquire into all who had gone missing since 1971 and 1989 rebellions.
The family members of the persons who had gone missing have the right to know whether their loved ones are dead or alive. This office is set up to ring redress to those affected. The JVP had filed six complaints so far regarding disappearances of their missing members, including their former leader Rohana Wijeyweera.
This proves that it provides equal opportunity to everybody regardless of any differences to find the persons who are reported missing, he said.
He also said that those who oppose for the setting up of this office is directly encouraging such actions to take place in the country again.
Nobody should fear if they had not made any person to disappear. You as journalists witnessed how your pen and camera were censored during the last regime. White van concept emerged and a number of people who were against the wrongdoings of the previous government went missing. No person can legitimately go missing. What had happened to them What paved the way for them to go missing - These questions should be answered. The office set up to find out about the missing persons will address these issues, he said.

Bill on Office on Missing Persons, risky
Former Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris warned that the Bill of the Office on Missing Persons is the most risky Bill passed in the recent past.
He made this observation during a Joint Opposition press conference at former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's office in Battaramulla yesterday.
He said passing of the Bill is not part of a home grown mechanism, but part of an international agenda.
He said 12 countries of the Human Rights Council influence Sri Lanka to keep the promises as pledged.
He said the passage of the Bill has serious repercussions on the country and for several generations to come. Prof. Peiris said the lives lost are equally important wherever they are hailing from. Refering to the 27 section of the Act, Prof. Peiris said the Act was focusing on investigating into the missing persons in the North and East.
He said the Act enables foreign interference in Sri Lanka.
He said the Act provides for getting unlimited foreign funds to the Office of the Missing Persons office and entering into agreements with foreign institutions, appointing officials and staff and access to any office.
He said national and provincial institutions are bound to follow the orders of the institution If some one is reluctant to provide details to the institution, it can punish them under the count of contempt of the Court of Appeal.
He said the institution would not be covered by the Right to Information Bill.

JVP urges govt to set up Truth Commission soon
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday urged the government to step up action to set up the proposed Truth Commission, pointing out that the recently passed Bill on establishing an Office of Missing Persons will be meaningless without a Truth Commission.
JVP National Organiser MP Bimal Ratnayaka said at a press conference at the JVP headquarters in Pelawatta, Battaramulla, a Truth Commission is needed to prevent the resurgence of past abuses and violence committed by one group on another.
A Truth Commission is needed to restore civic trust and to induce peaceful-co-existence between different groups of society, said Ratnayaka. The country has long been in need for a Commission to look into those grievances and suffering of the people relevant to the final phase of the war, he said. The government has come up with an office which will find and analyse information on the people who have disappeared during the conflict. There is no Commission to find truth. The government must establish it, he said.

Office on Missing Persons: JO ready for further talks with President
The Joint Opposition is prepared to have further discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena regarding the Office on Missing Persons and had made a written request for such an opportunity, Parliamentarian Keheliya Rambukwella said.
He said they are prepared to make any decision favourable to safeguard the rights of the present and future generation.
Rambukwella said President Sirisena still had an opportunity to intervene into this Act and they hoped the President would pay attention to it. He was addressing a press conference at former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's Office at Battaramulla yesterday.
Rambukwella said the Joint Opposition informed the President about the dangerous situation arising from this Act before the Bill was introduced in Parliament but the government had got it passed in Parliament in a matter of 45 minutes by bringing it up hastily.
Prof. G.L. Peiris said the Office of the Missing Persons Act was the result of an international programme, rather than a local programme.
He said this Act had opened the doors for international intervention and influence due to several obnoxious clauses.
