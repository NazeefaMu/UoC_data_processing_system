Beijing smog fails to obscure 'apocalypse' humour
CHINA: Several days of brown haze in Beijing so thick it has closed highways, suspended construction and brought official warnings to stay indoors have also prompted jokes about the end of the world.
Some of the Chinese capital's 22.5 million residents have turned to gallows humour to cope with persistent toxic air that again soared above hazardous levels on Tuesday, even as Paris climate talks continued half a world away.
A joke circulating among Chinese journalists told of a reporter approaching an old woman on the street to ask about the impact of the smog. "The impact is huge," the interviewee replies. "First of all, I'm your uncle."
Some users of China's popular Weibo microblog traced the shapes of famous Beijing landmarks on to photographs in which the buildings were nearly completely obscured by the smog and posted them online.
One said living in Beijing was like working as crew on a zombie apocalypse movie.
"As a friend finished eating lunch he slapped on his face mask and said he had to return to the set. They were filming Resident Evil in the afternoon," one microblogger joked, invoking the horror film series.
"Pray for Beijing" had become a meme on China's mobile messaging platform WeChat.
The US embassy's air quality monitor rated Beijing's smog as beyond the index for much of Tuesday, a level above the 301-500 band considered hazardous to health.
China's Ministry of Environmental Protection said on Sunday that the recent period of smog was due to "unfavourable" weather.
The hazardous air underscores the challenge facing China's government as it battles pollution caused by the coal-burning power industry, and will raise questions about its ability to clean up its economy at the talks in Paris.

Bitter rivals come together to revitalize cricket
One-time bitter rivals Thilanga Sumathipala and Jayantha Dharmadasa have teamed up together to take Sri Lanka Cricket forward when they announced their intentions to contest next months Sri Lanka Cricket elections.
While Sumathipala is contesting for the post of president, Dharmadasa is contesting for one of the two vice-presidency slots. K Mathivanan, a former vice-president is contesting again for the same post.
Mohan de Silva (secretary), Shammi Silva (treasurer) and Ravin Wickramaratne (assistant secretary) are the others contesting for positions.
The post of assistant treasurer is to be filled later.
Chairing a media conference at the SSC pavilion yesterday to announce their nominations for the elections Sumathipala and his team revealed a six-point plan they hope to implement if they are elected to office on January 4. Nominations close today.
Spelling out the plan Sumathipala, a three-time former president of SLC and presently deputy speaker of Parliament said that they had categorised six main pillars which they hope to transform Sri Lanka Cricket:
International Cricket Domestic Cricket Development Administration Finance, and Communication
It is a four-year plan which we hope to implement and complete by 2020. Sri Lanka Cricket needs a big transformation and we have come in partnership so that cricket will be the ultimate beneficiary, said Sumathipala. We have a very good team and we have a quality team of people that includes three past presidents in Jayantha Dharmadasa, Mohan de Silva and myself along with people who have served Sri Lanka cricket in the past.
Sumathipala stated that he plans to have a strong financial advisory committee with a number of reputed qualified people and hopes to use the experience of Nuski Mohamed, a past secretary and treasurer to head this committee.
He also revealed that they were bringing in Thushan Amarasuriya, son of former SLC interim chairman Hemaka Amarasuriya as a member of the sponsorship committee. Thushan is a former cricket captain of Royal College and is presently the treasurer of MCA. He comes from good stock, said Sumathipala.
The former president said that two former Sri Lanka captains Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara would be given big roles to play.
They are two of the most recent players involved in the current trend of international cricket. We should make maximum use of their experience and expertise in this field, Sumathipala said.
Stating reasons for coming forward to contest the elections Sumathipala stated, First and foremost there is an interim regime at the moment. Time and time again there have been allegations against various people at various times for the past 20 years and for about 8-9 years Sri Lanka Cricket has been run by interim committees and democratically elected bodies have come in.
When the membership approached me and wanted me to come and put the house in order, I spoke to the people who mattered and important for the game. When I discussed with the people especially past presidents and administrators, past cricketers and stake holders they wanted me to lead this side and assured me they would give me the support to put the house in order. Thats why I decided to hand over my nominations today.
Twice before Sumathipala had tried to contest the presidency of Sri Lanka Cricket and failed.
Once former president Mahinda Rajapaksa asked me not to contest at the eleventh hour so I did not give my nominations, said Sumathipala.
The other occasion when I wanted to contest they said my wife was involved with a sports good company. However she resigned but her resignation stamp duty was accepted two days after I had given my nomination.
They used that technical point and refused me permission to contest during Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamages time. You can very clearly see they have taken a very thin line to stop me from contesting. I dont think it was a valid reason and a reason was not given, he said.
Sumathipala said that he had the blessings of President Maithripala Sirisena to come forward and contest the election for the SLC presidency and that he had no issues related to the gambling industry as he has a letter from the ICC clearing him of any misdemeanor.

Flood waters reached till the second floor of the Housing Board colonies on the banks of the Adyar river as people reached rooftops looking for rescue and relief in several parts of the city and suburbs.
The death toll in the rains that have lashed the city and other parts of state has gone up to 197, officials said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who spoke to Chief Minister J Jayalalitha on Monday night and promised all assistance, held discussions with his Cabinet colleagues in the morning to take stock of the situation. The National Crisis Management Committee, headed by Cabinet Secretary P K Sinha, reviewed the situation and assured the state of all support.
Adding to the worry of the citizens and the administration, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast rainfall over the next three days. The next 48 hours will be very crucial, under the influence of a trough of low pressure and upper air circulation over the southwest Bay of Bengal and the Sri Lankan coast.
Thereafter, the state will see an anti-cyclone activity which will be associated with "heavy rains" at some places.
"The phenomenon will continue for the next seven days, but the next 48 hours are very crucial. Neighbouring states will also see rainfall activity," said IMD Director-General, L S Rathore.

Colombo Stock Exchange adopts GICS
The adoption of Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) by Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is very important step for sector investing and portfolio diversification, said Vajira Kulatilaka, Chairman of CSE.
CSE announced that CSE is adopting the GICS to classify its listed companies along with S&P/CSE co branded sector indices. The pilot period commenced on December 02, 2015. "This globally accepted standard not only will enable foreign investors to analyze the sector diversity of the Sri Lankan equity market but also local investors to truly diversify," he said.
GICS was jointly developed by Standard & Poor's and MSCI Barra to meet the global financial community's need for one complete, consistent set of global sector and industry definitions. The world's leading financial professionals across all investment disciplines, have adopted GICS as the classification standard. The CSE intends to consider GICS as an alternative classification of companies for a pilot period of one year during which period the current classification would also be maintained alongside the proposed GICS. This will provide adequate time for the stakeholders to be comfortable with GICS facilitating a smooth transition.
Rajeeva Bandaranaike, CEO of CSE said, "We are sure that the decision to adopt GICS would enhance the market infrastructure and help the investors to better understand the characteristics and change of industry structure. The gradual implementation of the project will help smooth transition from the existing classification to GICS."
Alka Banerjee, Managing Director, Head of Equity Indices Product Management, S&P Dow Jones Indices said, "We look forward to being a part of the Sri Lankan equity market growth journey."

CR favourites to beat CH
It was always of spectator interest in the past to see the battle between Colombo's two leading rugby clubs CR&FC and CH&FC battling it out for supremacy in their traditional encounter when they meet in the 2015/16 Dialog 'A' division inter-club league rugby first round match at Race Course grounds at 4.00 pm today.
Both teams have not been performing to their full potential and therefore have mixed fortunes in their previous outings this season.
CR, with a well-balanced side supplemented by their fighting spirit will go out as favourites while the lads from CH & FC will take every effort to make the day tough for the Red Shirts by at least cutting down the winning margin.
CR & FC got off to a flying start this season when they came from behind 9-15 to down Army SC 35-15 but went down to the rejuvenated Havelock's side by 34-18 with a pathetic performance where nothing really clicked for them at their home grounds at Longden Place last week.
On the other hand the lads from Maitland Crescent kicked off the season with a 3-80 thrashing from reigning league rugby champs Kandy SC at Nittawela in the first week and suffered another beating 0-62 at the hands of Police at Police Park last week.
The lads from Longden Place will be led by ex Peterite second row forward Ishan Noor while former Zahira College flanker Rifkhan Siddiq will captain the Maitland Crescent boys.
Teams:
CR and FC (probable side): Nipuna Devinda, Lahiru Pavithra, Shane Sambandapperuma, Dilanka Perera, Ishan Noor (captain), Sasanka Ariyaratna, Jason Disanayaka, Arun Kumar, Kavindu de Costa and Ashan de Costa, Mekalanka Pramoda, Kanchana Ramanayaka, Bhanuka Nanayakkara, Sashan Mohamad, Rochana Hettiarachchi.
CH and FC (probable side): Steve Nelson, M. Nizmin, U. Perera, T. Hasaranga,Rahiru Prabod, M. Farhan, Andrew Siriwardana, Rifkhan Sideek (captain), S.Migara ,Gazzaly Ifthikar (son of famous Isipathana ruggerite M.D.Ifthikar), Sajith Bandara, V.Hewage, Udara Madhusanka, Migara Madugalla, Ganidu Hewage, Prasad Perera. - (WAI)

Dutch Policeman held for Online sale of MH17 'Souvenirs'
THE NETHERLANDS: Dutch police have suspended an officer who tried to sell online souvenirs said to have come from the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 shot down over war-torn Ukraine last year.
The man is under arrest for embezzlement and an investigation has been launched and the man is under arrest for embezzlement, police said in a statement.
He had tried to sell "a piece of the clothing he used at the crash site" when teams were investigating the disaster involving the plane flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, the statement added.
All 298 people on board MH17, mostly Dutch citizens, were killed when the plane was hit by a Russian-made BUK missile fired from territory held by pro-Russian rebels in July last year, according to a Dutch-led inquiry.
Apart from the clothing, the man had also tried to sell on the Dutch website Marktplaats (Marketplace) a packet of Malaysia Airlines tissues and another unknown item which allegedly came from the downed plane.
Marktplaats told Dutch television NOS that the "offensive" link had now been removed from the site.
The man had tried to sell the items for 1,500 euros ($1,600), billing them as a "wall decoration" made from a jacket and cap given to the investigators, as well as the tissues and what he said was "a piece of the hull," NOS reported.
The police said "further research will determine" whether the items actually came from the plane.
The prosecution service has also launched an investigation. No details of the police officer's identity were revealed. - AFP

Fiji look for Olympic boost from Sevens defence
Dubai, United Arab Emirates Thursday: Fiji begin the defence of their World Sevens title in Dubai on Friday with eyes on a repeat victory in 2016 as well as giving their country an historic first Olympic medal.
Rugby Sevens makes its Olympics debut in Rio in August where the inventive, muscular and fleet-footed Fijians will be amongst the hot favourites for the gold.
"It's really an exciting season when you have the Olympics in the background," said Fiji captain Osea Kolinisau, conscious of the fact that his country has never won a medal at the Olympics.
Last season, Fiji, coached by Englishman Ben Ryan, finished 10 points ahead of South Africa.
They won four rounds of the global series, making sure of their place in the Olympics in the process.
In Dubai, the first of 10 rounds which concludes in London in May, Fiji have been drawn in Pool A along with Argentina, Canada and Japan.
"When you are defending champions, there is always pressure," 30-year-old Kolinisau told www.worldrugby.org.
"Everybody tries to knock you off your pedestal. Training has been hard in the build up to Dubai as we know it's always hard to defend a title.
"We have beefed up a lot of our training and most players have put on a bit of weight. We know that a lot of teams are gunning for us and for the series."
Fiji certainly raised the standards in their title-winning season -- they scored more tries on average than any other team at 4.5 tries per match, or one every 44 seconds of possession.
They also managed to win the 2014/2015 crown without losing a single match in pool play.
Pool B in the UAE is made up of defending Dubai champions South Africa, Scotland, Samoa and Russia.
New Zealand are in Pool C alongside the United States, France and Portugal while England, Wales, Australia and Kenya will fight out Pool D.
South Africa have named 35-cap Springbok Francois Hougaard and Juan de Jongh for the first two legs in Dubai and home soil in Cape Town next week.
Western Province centre and captain De Jongh is back in the Sevens squad for the first time in seven years.
The All Blacks were third overall last time out and long-serving coach Gordon Tietjens has selected 14 players with Waikato Chiefs half-back Augustine Pulu in line for his debut.
The women's sevens tournament also takes place at the weekend where New Zealand are the defending champions.
New Zealand coach Sean Horan said he and his backroom staff will be keen to keep thoughts of Rio under tight wraps.
"It is at the back of the minds though and the players know where it is going, but for us as management it is about the bigger picture," said Horan.

Fitch assigns 'A-(lka)' rating to LB Finance; Outlook stable
LB's National long-term rating reflects its established franchise among licensed finance companies (LFC), whose higher yielding exposures have supported sound profitability.
The rating also captures its relatively higher risk appetite as indicated by its exposure to gold-backed loans.
Fitch views LB's capital as satisfactory taking into account the entity's good revenue generation.
LB's leading 11% deposit market share among LFCs, as well as its extensive branch network have supported the company's funding position. At the same time, it also exposes LB to higher liquidity risk compared with peers in particular as gross loans reached 90% of assets at end 1HFY16 which is higher than the industry.
Meanwhile, its share of liquid assets (as a % of total assets) declined to 9%. Mitigating factors include its moderately concentrated deposit base and un-utilised backup facilities.
Fitch sees LB's product exposure to gold-backed loans (17% of gross loans at end 1HFY16) as being a potential risk to its asset quality due to the volatility of gold prices even though the focus is on short tenure facilities (almost all under six months).

Hollande has best ratings since 2012 after Paris attacks
FRANCE: French President Francois Hollande's ratings zoomed up to 50 per cent, the best since 2012, following his hardline response against jihadists after the Paris attacks, a poll showed Tuesday.
Trust in the French president jumped from 15 per cent in November to 35 per cent in December, back to a level last seen in December 2012, the TNS-Sofres One Point poll for Le Figaro daily showed.
Hollande, a Socialist elected in May 2012, has for most of his mandate been given the lowest ratings for a French president.
Now he is doing better than conservative ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy did at the same stage of his tenure.
However, a smaller jump in his approval ratings after attacks in January was short-lived, suggesting support could fade again in the longer run toward reelection in 2017.
France's unemployment rate is now above the euro zone average for the first time since 2007, according to Eurostat data, which is likely to hurt his ratings.
Besides, 63 per cent of those surveyed for the December poll still say they do not trust him.
Hollande's Socialist Party, which now rules most regions as well as the country, is seen suffering huge losses in regional elections on December 6 and 13, even if the defeat could be somewhat smaller than it may have feared a few weeks ago.
The survey was based on the views of 1,000 people polled at home between November 26 and November 28. - AGENCIES

IIHS focuses on building student personality and skills in Public relations, while following the programme, which in return will guarantee working opportunities for the students.
This is what sets apart IIHS from other institutions, which provide only theoretical knowledge at a diploma or at a degree level.
The Advanced Diploma in Business Management delivered at IIHS qualifies students to study further by creating pathways in which students may study 2 years in Sri Lanka and complete 2 years in selected universities abroad such as in Australia and United Kingdom.
This Advanced Diploma in Business Management programme by IIHS can be followed by those who are currently employed in the field and have five years of working experience as lectures are held during the weekends.
Students who have five minimal passes including English and mathematics at G.C.E. Ordinary Level examination, can also apply for this programme even if they have not completed or got through the Advanced Level.
This is possible after following eight months of study in the 'International Foundation in Business Management' at IIHS.
The payment for the advanced diploma programme is provided in convenient packages by IIHS, as they are the only institution which provides this program in the Gampaha District.

Lanka to attract four million tourists - Minister Amaratunga
Sri Lanka hopes to attract four million tourists by 2020, said Minister of Christian Affairs and Tourism Development, John Amaratunga.
"Up to October 2015, arrivals stood at 1.4 million visitors (an all-time high) and tourism arrivals are expected to reach a record two million visitors this year."
He also disclosed that the formal and informal sector room strength currently stands at 33,426 and this will increase to 45,000 rooms by 2018. Speaking at the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Tourist Hotels Association of Sri Lanka at the Taj Samudra in Colombo, he said that the industry must gear itself and be ready for a tourism boom in the next few years.
"One of the biggest issues facing the hospitality industry today is the shortage of skilled staff and the industry must take note of this and act immediately." "Dozens of new properties are coming up across the island and based on work-in-progress, over 10,000 new rooms will be added to the inventory in the next couple of years. We need highly skilled personnel to deliver what we promise. Unfortunately there is a severe shortage of such personnel," the Minister said.
It was revealed that the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management has launched an aggressive island-wide campaign to recruit school leavers to the hospitality trade.
"We have started the recruitment drive in Anuradhapura recently and will be taking it to Hambantota on December 5 and 6 where 100 youth are expected to be enrolled to the satellite school there, Minister Amaratunga said. (SS)

Lankan batsmen fall to spin in NZ
QUEENSTOWN: The Sri Lankans' top order made a shaky start to their tour of New Zealand, losing five wickets for 97 on the rain-curtailed first day of their practice match against the NZC President's XI at Queenstown.
Left-arm quick Neil Wagner - who is in New Zealand's Test squad - claimed two of those wickets, after the hosts had won the toss and elected to bowl.
Canterbury off-spinner Tim Johnston made the greatest impact of the day, taking three wickets for nine from six overs, sparking a Sri Lankan collapse that cost the visitors four wickets for eight runs, towards the end of the 40-over day.
Opener Dimuth Karunaratne top-scored for the Sri Lankans, hitting 49 not out off 103 balls. He was kept company for 56 runs by Udara Jayasundera before the collapse came. Jayasundera hit 21 for 68 deliveries. Kithuruwan Vithanage (4), Dinesh Chandimal (0) and Angelo Mathews (3) were the men out in quick succession following Jayasundera's dismissal.
Milinda Siriwardana survived 10 balls alongside Karunaratne to end the day.
Sri Lankans 97-5 at close (Dimuth Karunaratne 49, Udara Jayasundara 21, Neil Wagner 2/23, Tim Johnston 3/9) v NZ Board President's XI.

Sri Lanka's robust economic growth and development policy provides enormous potential for further enhancement of economic relations between the two countries, especially in trade, investment and tourism, said Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama.
Sri Lanka's total trade turnover with Japan has shown a threefold increase during the period of 2009-2014.
Keeping in line with the Economic Policy of the new Government, Sri Lanka offers a conducive, safe and stable environment to attract investment. This is, therefore, a high time for Japanese entrepreneurs to look at Sri Lanka, not only as an attractive business destination but also as a gateway to the entire South Asian region.
"Under the framework of the Memorandum of Cooperation on Vitalization of Inter-Governmental Economic Policy Dialogue signed between the two countries during the visit of Japanese Prime Minster Abe in September last year, we look forward to the convening of the first intergovernmental Economic Policy Dialogue between the two countries.
This is with a view to further expand bilateral trade, investment and economic engagement, Amunugama said addressing the gathering on the Japanese National day celebrated recently.

LAUGFS Eco Sri takes Mobile VET Centres Online
LAUGFS Eco Sri, a subsidiary of LAUGFS Gas PLC has once again broken new ground by being the first organisation in the country to take its Mobile Vehicle Emission Testing (VET) Centres online.
This successful transition has been possible due to an innovative solution developed by the Eco Sri Technical Division to overcome numerous challenges commonly encountered in rural areas relating to internet connectivity.
The in-house developed router unit is an innovative, low-cost solution and an effective alternative to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and eliminates challenges arising from relying on a single mobile telecommunications operator.
Eco Sri operates 27 Mobile VET Centres spread across over 150 locations in the country's outskirts, which have previously been functioning offline due to various internet connectivity issues faced in remote parts of the country. The Mobile VET Centres' offline to online shift will now facilitate real-time monitoring of Mobile Centre operations, which could function from anywhere across the island, even in remote regions with poor signal quality.
The CEO of LAUGFS Eco Sri, Damayantha Dharmasiriwardana, attributed the success of the move to the in-house efforts of the LAUGFS Eco Sri Technical Division. "This ground-breaking move demonstrates Eco Sri's ability to discover new and innovative ways to improve our service offering. It also testifies to the unrivalled expertise and dedication of the staff of our Technical Division.
Their cutting-edge work has significantly heightened Eco Sri's already distinguished reputation as an industry innovator," Dharmasiriwardana commented.
Presently,22 Mobile VET Centres have successfully gone online with the remaining five centres scheduled to follow suit in the near future. Eco Sri's fleet of Mobile VET Centres adds to the company's operational strength and efficiency, catering to vehicle emission testing needs of motorists living in rural areas. Currently, Eco Sri also operates 84 fixed VET centres, all of which have already been networked to a central IT system and operates online.
In addition, the Mobile VET Centres have been fitted with the latest emission testing equipment and a GPS tracking system. The Mobile VET Centres' improved and effective functionality will help minimize air pollution levels and yield better fuel efficiency, ensuring that vehicles perform at an optimum level.
Speaking on the R&D innovation hub operating within Eco Sri, Head of Technical, Chinthana Wagapitiya recounted the inception of the R&D unit in 2013 with the objective of bringing out-of-the-box solutions to the operational challenges the company would face. "The team operates with the motto, Go Beyond The Imagination, and our team brings different sets of expertise and talent to the table. We have groomed them to produce innovations that add value not only within LAUGFS, but beyond as well," he elaborated. The R&D team's core responsibility is to advance the process technologies associated with the LAUGFS Eco Sri operation.
With the introduction of the new Octopus router, they have developed the most effective solution to overcome a major issue in VET Mobile operations.
Previously, there was no solution to support the requirement of transferring VET data to a Central Sever from any location in the country by using a service provider.
"Our plan is to introduce this unit not only to LAUGFS Eco Sri, but to the entire LAUGFS Group by 2016 and also to start production for the local market to cater to any other users who have similar solution requirements," added ChinthanaWagapitiya. Speaking further, the Technical Head spoke of some of the new innovations which the R&D team has successfully worked on to the prototype stage, including Sri Lanka's first E conversions for Petrol three-wheelers, a device which can replace all conventional PCs with an OS, as well as a low cost universal E-charging point to meet local requirement.

Merkel loses public support over refugees
GERMANY: Almost half of German voters do not want Angela Merkel to serve another term as chancellor, according to a poll.
Some 48 per cent of those questioned in the survey for Bild newspaper said they would not want Merkel to continue in office after the next German election, due to be held in 2017.
Forty-four per cent were in favour of Mrs Merkel remaining in power.
The findings are an indication of how dramatically Mrs Merkel's public support has fallen in recent weeks following opposition to her "open-door" refugee policy.
Just a few months ago, her leadership seemed unassailable, and her Christian Democrat party was even daring to contemplate the possibility of an overall majority in 2017.
Mrs Merkel is not facing disaster yet. Despite the drop in her support she has no obvious challenger, and her party remains well ahead in the polls, at 38 per cent, one point up from a week ago. Its nearest rival, the Social Democrats, are 13 points behind on 25 per cent.
But the latest poll found 47 per cent of voters believed Mrs Merkel had handled the refugee crisis badly, and 44 per cent thought she had done well.
The chancellor has refused to back down from her policy or impose a limit on the number of asylum seekers the country will take.
Some 950,000 are believed to have entered so far this year, considerably more than the official government forecast of 800,000.
Germany's top defence official has said 1,200 soldiers may be sent to the Middle East by the end of the year to provide service support in the fight against Isil.
Volker Wieker said Merkel saw a bigger German role as the price to pay for Francois Hollande's support in tackling the refugee crisis.

Lanka made history by reducing powers of executive presidency'
Sri Lanka has created a historic revolution unsurpassed by any other country in the South Asian Region by curtailing the powers of the Executive President and transferring them to a strong Parliamentary system, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday in parliament.
He also said that such a strong Parliament could not be found in South Asia and it was an achievement made without protest or shedding a drop of blood.
The Premier made these observations yesterday joining the committee stage debate on the budget under 22 financial heads including the President, the Prime Minister's office, etc.
He said the new change - the strong parliament - was effected by a National Unity Government and not solely by the UNP. The credit should go to the two main parties although a certain faction attempts to portray this as a UNP achievement.
This change was initiated with the introduction of SLFP Secretary General Maithripala Sirisena as the Common Candidate to fulfill the aspirations of the people. "He reduced his own powers. His view was to reduce more powers but the Supreme Court ruled that it should be carried out under a referendum," the Prime Minister said.
He said the new government set up Independent Public Service Commission, Independent Judicial Service Commission, National Police Commission, Human Rights Commission, Election Commission, Financial Commission, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or corruption, etc. - which former President Mahinda Rajapaksa refused to set up.
"As all have got together, let us work in the Constitutional Council. All members and ministers should attend sittings to answer the questions" the Premier said. He said if the members including ministers don't attend parliament we can amend the standing orders and make it compulsory to attend Parliament. The Prime Minister also said the Parliament could be made stronger by formulating standing orders to inform the Speaker if a member is being absent.
"We will set up oversight committees chaired by an opposition member, which is a mechanism that can influence the government," the Premier said. "The controlling of finance comes under the Parliament. But earlier all these powers were under the President. This situation was changed after January 8," he said.
"The Cabinet yesterday approved the Right to Information Bill. The Bill to increase female representation upto 25 percent within local government institutions will be presented in Parliament," the Premier said. "The National Audit Bill, the District Development Board Bill and Bill to set up Gramarajya centres are being formulated," he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said each Gramaseva Division would be given Rs. 1.5 million for its development.
"We will discuss from next Monday with experts to change the electoral system which will be a blend of the proportionate system and the first past the post system to create a stable government," he said.
"In European countries, the election advertisements cannot be telecast during election time. It is banned. We too can follow that system. Even we can make arrangements to provide money through parliament for parties carry out their election campaigns. The members only have to give the bank account details. We can go for this new age. I know some will not agree with these proposals," Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
"We can make this country a high income earning country by 2032. A place should be set up in the Parliament for members to meet heir voters. We have only one place - it is this Parliament. We have decided to utilise the Agriculture Ministry building," the Premier said.
He said the members should be granted money and facilities to render their services to the people.
"The expenditure on ceremonies at the President's House in 2014 was Rs. 335 million. It could be reduced to Rs. 34 million in 2015. Expenditure to convey condolence messages in 2014 was Rs. 15 million while it came down to Rs. 300,000 in 2015. Water bills in the buildings of the President's House in 2014 was Rs 44 million and it was reduced to Rs. 24 million in 2015 while Rs. 227 million 2014 electricity bill was reduced to Rs. 91 million in 2015. The expenses for telephone usage in 2014 were Rs. 69 million was reduced to Rs 45 million in 2015 while the miscellaneous expenses at the President's House were at Rs. 732 million and it was reduced to Rs 22 million in 2015.
The Prime Minister said the total amount that could be saved including vehicles, building maintenance, etc. is Rs. 1,476 million. The number of vehicles in the President's vehicle pool was 553 in 2014 and it was reduced to 223 in 2015. He said 158 vehicles had been used by the Presidential Secretariat in 2014 while that figure could be reduced to 116 this year. About 103 vehicles were rented in 2014 while none in 2015.
"A member is given Rs. 15 million through the decentralized budget. With those savings we can allocate more funds through the decentralized budget to the members."
At this stage opposition member Bandula Gunawardena inquired of the pension of the public servants.
"If we speak the truth when we took over the government, there was no mechanism introduced to pay the pensions. If we recruit public servants there should be a way to pay their pensions."
"So we have to develop the economy. When we develop economy the public servants would get more facilities. Today public the servants don't get a good salary," Prime Minister said. He said the country could reach a position to pay a high salary to public servants as in other developed countries.
President's simplicity reflects in budgetary allocation for his office - Rajitha
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratna told Parliament yesterday that it is for the first time in the history that a son of a farmer family has become the President of this country.
The minister said so, while participating at the Committee stage debate of the Budget 2016 for the first allotted day.
"We have elected a pro-people President for the first time. Following the Bandaranaike era, the SLFP entered a family centred era. After the Bandaranaike family, another ruling family was created from Madamulana. The result was the nepotism ruling for a number of years in the SLFP. This was changed after President Sirisena came to power. The simplicity of the President is reflected in the budgetary allocation for the President. Compared to the allocations to the President during the previous regime, this allocation is minimal," Senaratne said.
Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said the allocation made to the President through this budget is very low compared to the previous budgetary allocations. This shows President Sirisena's simplicity to the world.
"There is a need to change the Preferential Voting system. Therefore, we must introduce the new electoral system with the support of all political parties," he said.
UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardene said that there is a need to introduce a new electoral system which is responsible to the Parliament. Necessary legislation for electoral reforms need to be presented in parliament soon.
City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said it is very important to receive a 2/3 majority for the vote on Second Reading debate of the budget 2016. This can be described as a result of the political consensus.
Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that investments will flow into the country if there is a political stability.
Today, the political stability has created in the unity government formed by the two major political parties.
President Maithripala Sirisena goes in the annuls of the history as the Executive President who voluntary reduced his powers.
The made the world to praise and accept him. It is significant that the TNA voted for the vote on second reading of the budget 2016 for the first time in the history.
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake said that there was a huge number of complaints of massive financial misappropriation by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
But no MP in the Opposition countered those allegations. They only made use of former President to come to Parliament.
No good governance in the country - Dinesh
MP Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday said that there is no good governance in the country.
He made this observation joining the Committee Stage Debate on the Budget proposals under 22 financial heads including the President, the Prime Minister's office, etc.
MP Gunawardane said that the government is asking them to support the budget without providing necessary information.
He also said that election laws should be amended and urged to bring laws to change the country's electoral system before Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera's three months' alms giving as the President promised delivering a speech at the funeral of the Nayake Thera.
He also urged the government to announce local government election by December 31 after changing the electoral system.
"A total of 335 local government bodies are being administered by special commissioners after their terms expired. How can the government ensure the democracy of the country by keeping local government bodies under the administration of special commissioners, he asked.
Employment for graduates under one million job programme

'Sri Lanka's export structure needs re-looking'
Sri Lanka's export structure should be re- looked as it hasn't changed over the last 70 years, Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said.
Despite the fact that Sri Lanka has graduated from a poor country to a lower middle income country, Sri Lanka's export structure is one of a poor country with the SME sector contribution to total exports remaining at less than 5%.
This is in a backdrop where other low middle income countries' SME sector contributing 30-40% to the total exports.
To address this issue, Sri Lanka should capitalize on its strategic location near major Indian sea lanes and skilled human resource to specifically increase re-exports from Sri Lanka which in turn will contribute to country's GDP.
We have a long way to go. Until we get there; we are never going to par this economy, Our inability to deal with fundamental issues is a huge cost, as a result some local industries are already in crisis, minister said adding that the local export community should take immediate measures to systematically boost exports rather than solely depending on Sri Lanka's inherited colonial plantation based economy.
"Corruption is a disease. Whoever is in the government; it's a disease that needs to be treated. Corruption will make you rich today, but it will make your children poorer tomorrow." Corruption is a cancer that destroys the social fabric of the society," the Minister noted.
Wickramaratne added the government is willing to work differently, not on the basis of patronage and favours for a few, but on the basis that the government will change the system to work in the industry's favour.
