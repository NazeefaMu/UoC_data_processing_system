Icon stands alone
Dr Lester James Peries has everything in excess what his predecessors, contemporaries and successors almost lacked: covetous longevity, unrivalled celebrity status and many more. Dr Peries turned 97 in April, probably becoming the most-discussed cinema icon alive.
He has been the subject for over 20 publications that cover a wide range of his life and cinema. The latest to emerge was Lester - Cinema and Sri Lanka by Ajith Galappatty to mark the longest living cinema icons birthday.
In Litchat, Galappatty attempts to spell out why Dr Peries deserves such a wide symposium.
Q: Dr Lester James Peries has dozens of books written on him and his cinema. Dont you think that you have just made the pile heavy, with your addition
Ajith Galappatty
A: I made use of about 24 books on Dr Peries. You can count mine as the 25th addition. Now, all these 24 books focus on him in different angles. It started in 1966, when Karunasena Jayalath penned a pamphlet-like critique on Delovak Athara. It reached pinnacle with Dr Tissa Abeysekaras Ahasin Polovata screenplay. But in my honest opinion, none of these books is a serious study of Dr Lester James Peries.
Q: Almost every author of the 24 books could claim some authority on Sri Lankan cinema. But you claim these books have not studied Lester properly. How do you justify that claim
A: A major portion of the books contain nuts and bolts about Lesters 67-year cinema history. Some books report back what Lester expressed about his films and Sri Lankan cinema in general. Another is an anthology of newspaper articles on him. Another is a compilation. See, there is hardly any serious study. But I see them as a rich source that leads anyone to take up Lester as a serious study.
Q: It indicates that you are not hesitant to affirm your study of Lester as a serious one.
A: I was interested in cinema since schooldays. We know that many heroes emerged in Sri Lankan history of cinema. But for me, Lester is the one and only hero. He stands alone even today. So I focused my higher studies too on Lester and his cinema. Whenever I published my own critiques, I focused on aspects of Lesters cinema as well. Even for my MSSc I chose Lesters cinema. I dedicated 10 years to watch his films and read books written about them analytically.
Q: Do you see Lester as a hero
A: Yes. He is the one and only hero. Just take a look at the initial stages of our cinema, and you will realise why he is a hero. I am talking about the forties and fifties. That was the period when our local cinema artistes were very much under South Indian influence.
But Lester stood alone. He trod his own path. When Indian forces had our cinema in their grip, Lester studied in the west and fused that knowledge to our cinema in his own way. I see that as an act of heroism.
Q: Wasnt there any other hero before or after Lester
A: There could be. We come across many heroes. But Lester is more heroic than all of them. For instance Sirisena Wimalaweera fought against the South Indian grip. He is a hero. B A W Jayamanna was carried away by South Indian filmmakers, but later he became an independent cinema artiste. So he is a hero. Then we meet Shanthi Kumar Seneviratne who stood alone. His story was chosen for a film by a South Indian producer. But Shanthi Kumar had gumption to demand that he should make that film. There are many more. But they can hardly get closer to Lester.
Q: I sense some idolatrous admiration in you for Lester.
A: Well, I am not a faithful devotee of Lester. I personally like only a few out of his all films. But I can say that the books written about him are authored by his devotees.
Q: Will you make clear why you see Lester as a hero
A: When Lester directed his first film Rekhava in 1956, it was accepted as the first cinematic local film. That was because you can see a lot of cinematic features in Rekhava. Of course, there were films based on local culture and local flavour before Lester. But they lacked cinematic creativity. They were films based on local culture yet without any cinematic creativity.
That was a major setback during the pre-Lester era. This is one primary reason why I see Lester as a hero.
Q: If Rekhava was made in 1956, Lesters cinema life turns 60 this year. In a previous answer, you called it Lesters 67-year cinema history.
A: Lesters starting point is not Rekhava. He made a short film called Soliloquy. That was in 1949, while he was still in England. Based in England, Lester continued to make a few more short films. There is hardly any information available about these short films for a serious study. Apparently no one has bothered to take up a study on Lesters creative life in England.
Information is scarce, though it does not mean that we should forget Lesters initial stages. Those films must also be counted as Lesters cinema history.
Q: You have dedicated a separate chapter for Lesters 12-minute short film. Is it that significant
A: Certainly. Lester comes to Sri Lanka because of that short film. That was an amateur film, but an experimental one. That was awarded in England as the best experimental film.

Princes vault drilled opened
Underneath Princes Paisley Park estate is a bank vault full of unreleased music. Now, according to ABC News, the vault has been opened by Bremer Trust, who was appointed administrator of the estate following the musicians death.
ABC News notes that Bremer Trust was forced to drill open the vault as only Prince knew the key code. Inside they discovered enough unreleased music to release a new album every year for the next century.
According to Princes former sound engineer, Susan Rodgers, the vault pre-dates the release of 1984s Purple Rain. When I left in 87, it was nearly full, she explained in an interview with the Guardian. Row after row of everything wed done. I cant imagine what theyve done since then.
It remains to be seen whether the music will ever be released. Prince had no will at the time of his death, and already his family members are fighting over his assets.

Dangayange Avurudu 2016
Whyteleaf Performing Arts Academy held its annual New Year celebrations Dangayange Avurudu at Ratmalana recently. This event was organised for children and consisted of many traditional Avurudu games, singing and dancing performances. It was held with the attendance of several distinguished artistes like Jagath Wickramasinghe, Ashika Mathasinghe, Dinakshi Priyasad and Lakshan Wattuhewa.
The events included the Whyteleafe Avurudu Kumara and Kumariya, Fancy Dress Parade, Pillow Fight (Kotta Pora), Blind Pot Breaking (Kana Mutti Bideema), Marking the Elephants Eye (Aliyata Aha Thabeema) and many others. The students of the Academy skillfully drew upon their talents and eagerly participated in the events.
Keeping in line with the values of the Whyteleafe Academy, the judging of games such as the Whyteleafe Avurudu Kumara and Kumariya involved a wide range of criteria like personality, knowledge and capabilities instead of just the outward appearance.
Imaya Bogoda was crowned the Whyteleafe Avurudu Kumariya (age group 11-16) and Dilya Janadheera was the Whyteleafe Singithi Avurudu Kumariya (age group 4 -10). Chamod Dabare was selected as the Whyteleafe Avurudu Kumara and Chaviru Perera was the Whyteleafe Singithi Avurudu Kumara.
Given the acting talents of the students at the Academy, the Fancy Dress competition became a very lively event of the day. Sajani Ranathunga and Kalindi Wanigasooriya were the winners of the senior and junior batches.
Students from both the Colombo and Kalutara branches of the Whyteleafe Academy participated in the celebrations along with their parents. The Prize Giving for the winners was held with the participation of veteran singer Jagath Wickramasinghe and his wife Gayani Wickramasinghe and the principal of St. Pauls Girls school, Sumeda Jayaweera.

Barefoot patrols to free little soles!
When I was a child, going barefoot seemed a capital idea and spelled Freedom with a capital F. If anyone dares object to my footloose and fancy free notions I will be tempted to shoo, sorry shoe them off, with a fine fff...flavoured flurry of fffff...foul invective.
We were, in those fabulous fifties, happy little unshod soles running the gauntlet of gravel, grass and rocky terrain. Yes, we also revelled in wading ankle deep in splendid, squelching mud. It all started after school was out or on holidays.
That was the time when as Sherlock Holmes, the greatest detective who never lived , could have been paraphrased as saying: The games afoot! Or rather, barefoot!
Even now some people with a colonial hangover still think its vulgar to bare your soles to strangers. Many of us found the constraint of shoes an uncomfortable aspect and freed our little soles at the earliest opportunity.
Consequently we lived as half-wild disciples of Tom Sawyer. Most Sri Lankan youngsters of my vintage would go barefooted out of choice rather than necessity.
You see, you had to wear shoes to school with white cotton socks to boot. It was and still is a fixation of an old colonial sartorial legacy to be properly shod to school, church and even certain informal events such as a movie. Abandoning footwear was the done thing at the time. No one thought this odd, because it wasnt. It is true that among the negative aspects of being barefoot was the risk of being skewered with thorns or broken glass.
Soon our soles toughened to leather and we traversed everywhere, even on gravel, or heated tar or asphalt without ill effect. For instance we were immune to the tiny thorns of the Nidhi Kumba, (Mimosa Pudica) plants that proliferated everywhere. We boldly trampled the touch-me- not leaves with bare calloused feet every time they opened up again and again giving the poor shy weeds a nervous breakdown.
But the larger thorns our poor little soles encountered were quite a different prickly proposition particularly when they penetrated deeply. Fortunately our ayahs at the time were experts in emergency surgery digging out the thorns with safety pins in lieu of scalpels. They would sterilise the affected area with lime as both cleanser and disinfectant before performing the surgical procedure. If the thorn was embedded too deep they would tie a poultice of freshly scraped coconut which eventually drew the entrenched object out. Yet bare feet brought a whole new happy dimension to our lives. For the little females of the species they were excellent for playing hopscotch on packed ground because it was a lot easier to avoid the lines without their school regulation tennis shoes on.
Besides, the brown earth, cold and hard, felt good to our pavement-scorched feet. Bare heels rounded the Jill marble hole for our attabola games to perfection. All this helped us develop a remarkable degree of prehensile strength in our big toes.
Tired of squatting around the marbles square we would stand, grip the marbles on the ground dexterously with our toes and retrieve them without bothering to bend. The tenderfoot of today who has always run around shod would never be able to perform such a feat. Going barefoot in nature ensured that the sole of the foot would build itself a thicker callous of skin and toughen up - all the better to go barefoot with!
When the first day of school came following the holidays, we boys clothed our freshly scrubbed feet in respectable white socks and tucked them into sturdy- laced brown Oxfords or Barratt shoes. After a week of suffering from too-tight shoes our feet would spread out because we had gone barefoot all through the holidays.
I was once rain-larking in the backyard when my mother called out: Youve left your shoes behind! To which I replied: At least theyre not getting wet as I padded along barefoot enjoying splashing in the puddles. I am still uncertain as to whether I got my ears boxed for the sassy remark or for running barefoot in the rain.
I remember distinctly a time that people of all ages used wooden clogs to keep their feet clean and protected. These were ugly, noisy and clumsy clod-hoppers with a crude leather strap nailed in to stirrup ones feet in. That was before the invention of rubber flip-flops which were to come a decade later and named for the sound they made when you walked  flip, flop, flip, flop  but they could have been called ouch-umphs, the sound youll make after wearing them all the time.
Flip-flops beat the old wooden clogs for comfort and balance feet down. At issue, though, is their utter lack of foot support. You have to scrunch your toes to keep the flip-flop on the foot while the heel lifts in the air. Today flip-flops have moved beyond the domain of beach bums to take their place among sturdier sandals for everyday use. Most everyone wears them now.
I was fortunate to grow up in a country at a time when going barefoot was not just tolerated, it was commonplace and in some communities actually expected when you were a child. I personally never feel quite so free and balanced as when I am barefoot and my wish for the children of the world is that they should be as fortunate as I was.
I was once late to serve at the 6.30 am holy Mass in the Carmalite chapel close to my home so I hotfooted it to be on time. The cloistered nuns did not look kindly on tardy altar servers. Fortunately for me the celebrant priest was even later than I. He rode in on his scooter just as I rang the chapel bell.
I realised all of sudden that in my dash to serve the Almighty I had completely forgotten my shoes. Rev. Fr. Neddy dismounting from his scooter asked me why I looked worried so early in the morning. I told him I had overslept and had forgotten my shoes. He uttered a booming laugh and raising his cassock slightly and said: That makes two of us my son. We are both completely naked from the ankles down!

On a high 
The time has come to storm the classroom! The International Center for Credentialing and Education of Addiction Professionals (ICCE) is about to take the war into the classroom with the weapon being the books!
The idea is to equip people/the workforce with the knowledge and skills to combat drugs. Daily News visited Colombo Plan to find out more about this initiative.
As part of Colombo Plans flagship Long Term Scholarship Program (LTSP) the International Centre for Credentialing and Education (ICCE) is about to launch a fellowship program in collaboration with Universities in Asia and Africa. ICCE is part of the Colombo Plan which has 27 member countries. The Fellowship program is a collaboration between ICCE and Tertiary education institutions. The Colombo Plan ICCE fellowship program will bring mid-career addiction professionals from Africa and Asia to participating universities in the region to further enhance their professional development in the addiction treatment field. This fellowship program will be of importance to Sri Lanka since ICCE is looking at collaborating with higher education institutions in Sri Lanka as well, said ICCE, Director Tay Bian How.
ICCE celebrates seven years of dedicated work to train, professionalize and expand the drug demand reduction workforce in the region. In February 2009, ICCE began work as a project under the Drug Advisory Program and has come a long way since then.
The World Drug problem is very serious. There are quarter of million people using drugs from age 15  64. People are relapsing and this addiction is not curable. But it can be managed just like hypertension and diabetes. Recovery can be lifelong. A person may need multiple episodes which means you may have to go to the treatment center several times, explained How.
All this research has culminated in a plan of action. Without just collecting dust on someones shelf it is now going to be used as a means of empowering people.
For the serious drug problem, there is a lot of research being done. The US has done so much research on drugs, but research alone is not enough. It has to be converted to practice. Until then it remains an academic exercise. If you are doing research in the university and it does not yield anything new or translated to actual practice, it is simply an academic exercise and just published in a journal. So, what we do is, we take this research and translate into teaching manuals to teach. These evidence based practices that we have got through research can be implemented into actual practice in treating a drug addict and in preventing a young person from getting into drugs, How pointed out. The easiest way to train the workforce is in Universities. That is why one of our current initiatives is to integrate all these manuals into a University degree course. We want to launch this fellowship program particularly for Asia and Africa.
Basic eligibility criteria
* A bachelor degree in a relevant field of study
* Five years working experience in a drug treatment or rehabilitation setting
* Less than 45 year of age
Program structure
A one year full time specialized program in addiction science is offered inclusive of a 240 hour practicum at a selected drug treatment or rehabilitation setting and submission of a project paper. This 30 credit hour course offers the latest evidence based strategies and interventions in Addiction Science, Substance Use Disorders (SUD) as outlined in the Basic level Universal Treatment Curriculum for Substance Use Disorders (UTC).
- Physiology and pharmacology for addiction
- Continuum of care
- Co- occurring mental and medical disorders
- Addiction counselling skills
- Screening
- Assessment
- Treatment planning and documentation
- Case management
- Crisis management
- Professional ethics
This is a one year program  a post graduate diploma program for midcareer personnel. These are people who are working in the substance use disorder field or working in an Addiction treatment or Prevention field. Currently we have a University in Malaysia. The University in Malaysia has confirmed that they have got all the approval for the post graduate diploma. It is not easy to implement a program like this since it has to be approved by the Minister of Higher Education and Quality assurance and so on. Cyberjaya University College of Medical Sciences, Malaysia has already agreed to host this fellowship. ICCE is looking at collaborating with other universities, outlined How.
The scholars will only learn Addiction Treatment or Prevention of Substance Use Disorder. You have people working in the field. They go for short courses and collect one or two week certificates. The significance of this fellowship program/ Post Graduate Diploma is that it is whole package. And when you get that qualification/ that diploma, you make yourself a specialist. You make yourself a professional, stated How.
The mandate of the Colombo Plan is to train and professionalize the workforce. To professionalize we have international credentials. In some countries you need a credential or license to work. ICCE is providing the license.
What we are giving is the International Certified Addiction Professional (ICAP), Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. The United States Credential is called Master Addiction Counsellor (MAC) or National Certified Addiction Counsellor (NCAC) Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.
So there are three separate qualifications here  The Post Graduate Diploma in Addiction Science, the International Certified Addiction Professional (ICAP) and the Master Addiction Counselor (MAC) or National Certified Addiction Counselor (NCAC) - This is the US Credential Out of these, those who successfully complete the ICCE Fellowship will be awarded the first two qualifications  the Post Graduate Diploma and the ICAP. Those who are not coming from this program and take short courses, can still sit for our exam to get credentials. So far 47 countries are participating in our programs. We have a singular universal credential recognized globally. If you want to work in the US, you can work there if you have our credentials, elucidated How.

Hospitality and banking under one roof
It is the first project of its kind and will be launched in Sri Lanka on May 5! Yes, now you will have the first service industry training institute in the world within your fingertips!
The service industry  banking, hospitality and tourism, logistics and transport, telecommunications, retailing  is the stage where the global war for talent is being fought. It is the only industry dependent on the human factor for its continued success, whereas manufacturing, already in decline, has only limited scope for a human labour force.
Sri Lanka is a country bubbling with young, raw talent, with little opportunity to prove themselves, although they could make a difference in the global workforce. And there is a track record of Sri Lanka producing some of the finest financial industry graduates for the global arena  although it may have been some decades ago  to warrant such a belief.
So it is time to change things. And to change the perception that a non-university career path is less attractive than an academic one. In Switzerland, where this institute originates, only a small minority of school leavers enter university. The remainder go for vocational and professional training which is so good that it brings them to the top of industry.
The vocational training sector has always worked very closely with the industry and produced graduates who are job-ready because they acquire skills relevant for industry. The change institute is bringing to Sri Lanka is vocational and professional education of the highest standards with Swiss certification so this country can lead the development for service industry talent not only in Sri Lanka, but in Asia as a whole.
The Swiss Institute commences operations this year with programs in hospitality and banking, which is also the name of the first institute: The Swiss Institute of Hospitality and Banking. Website: www.passport2career.com
The CEO of the new operation in Sri Lanka will be Dr. Rohith Gerald Delilkhan, a Swiss-based UK national with Sri Lankan roots, who has made a name for himself with governments and blue-chip companies in the banking, hospitality and travel industry. He has led German and Swiss companies in Switzerland, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Vietnam, the UAE and Oman, He has an impeccable track record in setting up and running quality education institutions.
The initial program portfolio consists of a major Train-The- Trainer program for hospitality and banking professionals in Sri Lanka to become certified Swiss standards trainers. This will be followed by a complete range of certification courses in hospitality from housekeeping, concierge and butler services, receptionist and front office roles, to food and beverages and kitchen training leading to a full diploma in hospitality. On the banking front we bring the first client advisor certification programs modelled after the Swiss and Singapore competency standards for the financial industry.
First programs commence in June, by year end 1,300 students will be enrolled. By the end of 2017, over 3,000 will have completed programs, within five years the annual intake will be 10,000. By then a residential campus and budget hotel, where hospitality students will be able to practice what we preach, will be in operation. There will also be a mobile training unit bringing programs to communities across the country, and this will commence early 2017.

The big short
Hot pants, boy shorts, baggies and bermudas  whatever the style, shorts have never gone out of fashion. A must for the summer, these lowers have transformed in terms of their structure, materials and even length, over the years.
Summer is all about comfortable style. So, your wardrobe needs to reflect that. Not only are shorts super comfortable, but with the number of options available, they are perfect for just about any occasion, says designer Sanya Dhir, adding, Designers are also giving shorts a couture twist. Embroidered hot pants are a delight. A fusion of classic and trendy shorts, this variety has sequins, dabka and nakshi elements, with intense zardozi work.
Contrary to popular perception, shorts need not be limited to casual outings only. Many international celebrities wear shorts on red carpets. Gwyneth Paltrow, Julia Roberts, Diane Kruger, Selena Gomez and Kristen Stewart have often sported shorts at formal events. So, they have proved that dressing formal is not always about being decked up from head to toe. At times, less is more; its all about how you carry your style, says designer Shehla Khan.
Dos and donts
1) Make sure your shorts arent too loose or too tight; you dont want them sliding off or creating unnecessary bulges
2) If you have long and lean legs, opt for hot pants. Those with shorter legs should stick to high-waisted options. Curvy women should go for skorts
3) Opt for shorts that are made using breathable fabrics like cotton, linen or khadi
4) Since shorts exude a relaxed vibe, chose your footwear according to the occasion. For instance, sport brogues with a pastel T-shirt and denim shorts for a casual day out. Or, make a fashionable statement by wearing the blazer-short set with a pair of stilettos at a formal do.

Paradise found

Mary Lussiana revels in Sri Lanka old and new - starting in a colonial tea planters bungalow and ending at a new resort on the islands lush southern coast
There must be only one place in the world where a breakfast table of high-altitude grown aromatic black tea, string hoppers, fish curry, dhal, pol roti and a jar of Marmite assembled together greets you upon rising. After, that is, the butler has brought you bed tea and drawn your bath.
The hill country of Sri Lanka perfectly blends the tangible remains of colonial culture with local colour and charm. At any of the four - soon to be five - century old Tea Planters bungalows, which together form Tea Trails, you can sit on the terrace at your breakfast table surrounded by lush gardens, gentle rain and shrill tropical birds and watch the steady work of the Tamil tea pickers as they move across the verdant slopes beneath you.
It is all too easy to imagine the 19th -century existence that the British men, whose names now grace the bedroom doors, must have had and to muse on how little really has changed here compared to so many parts of the world.
Of course, the Tea Masters are one thing that has, and the pluckers will now perhaps be the great grandchildren of those that started here when tea was brought to the Island in 1867 by Scottish planter James Taylor.
One of his descendants, Andrew Taylor, is based here, still in the tea business and will take you through the process from leaf to cup leaving you with a greater respect for this familiar drink than you will have arrived with.
But, it is not just the tea that entrances. Kayak across Castlereagh Lake and you will be enveloped in the misty tranquility.
Walk past waterfalls and flaming red African Tulip trees, glimpse the sacred mountain of Adams Peak soaring skywards and wind your way home to memorable dinners - one night a tea pairing of Earl Grey cured gravadlax followed by mint-crusted lamb partnered with a shot of smoky Lapsang Souchong; another a typical Cashew nut curry - as the inky dusk of the tropics falls and chanting from the temples echoes across the valley.
We flew the next day from the colonial past to Sri Lankas future. Cape Weligama is a brand new 40 villa resort, lying low on a palm studded headland on the islands beautiful southern coast. Designed by Thai architect, Lek Bunnag, it aims, according to owner Malik Fernando to cater to a new breed of traveller being attracted to our country. With the experience of Ceylon Tea Trails behind them, the Fernando family have seized the moment to expand into the hospitality market, packaging up the best local flavours to try, just in fact, as they do with their Dilmah teas.
For Weligama that means, escorted bicycle rides through emerald paddy fields, walks through cinnamon plantations, whale watching expeditions, diving and snorkelling. Gemologists will come and share their knowledge; historians their past.
Cape Weligama holds its own against any of the luxurious Indian Ocean resorts that grace the glossy magazines and of which there are few here, where accommodation tends to be more home than hotel in size. The villas are laid out in clusters, some of two, others of three and share a swimming pool whilst the hotels main half moon infinity pool, hanging over the cliffs edge, is the jewel in the crown.
Generous bedrooms spill into huge bathrooms, and on in some villas to sitting rooms. Oversized pebble baths open out onto terraces from where you can watch the enormous butterflies and minute humming birds, the monitor lizards and the monkeys, whilst the ocean roars beneath you. Spa therapists drawing on local teas, cinnamon and salt come to you to pummel expertly.
Your butler whisks away laundry. Local handicrafts from the many children supported by the Dilmah Foundation decorate a wall or make an umbrella stand. And then there is the breeze which blows through the resort, under the high ceilings and whirring fans, round the teak wood columns and rattan furniture imbuing the whole with a tentative sense of liberty, this new Sri Lanka, inching forward into the future.

TRACKED FOR FITNESS
Jogging Track Project in Gampaha district is becoming very popular. I perceive this project as a combined effort of engineers, ecologists and sociologists. Engineering solutions proposed in this project addresses flood mitigation along riverine environments while forming a narrow track along the bank with dredging operation to clean streams.
These tracks could be used as access to the riverbanks. There was no net loss in flood retention area in forming tracks because the required earth for tracks was obtained only from the vicinity. Earth was secured from outside only when it was necessary to improve the surface of the track to a jogging track. Tree plantation along stream banks introduced under the project mainly addresses Ecological needs such as enhancement of Bio Diversity in urban areas and reactivation of Bio Corridors for local wild habitat.
Creation of walking paths/ jogging track is an added social benefit addressing health aspects of urban communities who are suffering from various illnesses such as hypertension and Diabetes. Creating community awareness about the beauty of maintaining clean riverine environment, and the role of biodiversity in urban environments is another long-term social benefit.
Some sections of the banks could even be transformed into cycle tracks for urban communities as Environment-Friendly Transport (EST) systems. It is also expected that community members who regularly visit the tracks would become watchdogs of their natural environment especially the water resource which is becoming polluted at very rapid rate in urban setups because streams have become dumping sites of urban wastes.
Gampaha Jogging Track project
In this project, jogging track is popularly highlighted as the main benefit. However it is only a side benefit of macro level project targeting whole natural environment. For example, if you consider the master plan behind Gampaha Jogging Track project, it is planned to be a bio corridor commencing from the catchment area of Uruwal Oya around Plikuutuwa to Muthurajawela Wetland.
When this corridor traverses close to human-populated areas - in this case Gampaha Town - corridor was sophisticated as a jogging track by hard landscaping.
However, the project is basically an environmental project delivering benefits to the whole district. It is in fact an urban bio corridor addressing the needs of all living beings. Similar to highways connecting cities of human beings, bio corridors are the roads for the rest of the living beings connecting isolated forest patches in urban areas.
Dredging of streams is the conventional way of flood mitigation adapted by SLRDC. Plantation of trees along stream banks is a new concept introduced under this project implemented in parallel to dredging operations. Once a Riparian Trees are grown along stream reservations, stream banks become strengthened and soil erosion get minimised. Otherwise eroded soil gets deposited in downstream areas and the flood mitigatory effect gets gradually diminished with time. Riparian tree varieties such as Kumbuk and Karanda are ideal for stabilizing riverbanks. On the other hand, riparian tree belts also control the flood peaks.
Usually trees are being planted along side the road. However in this case it is streams. This is not the first time it was tried in Sri Lanka. Same concept was introduced in System B of Mahaweli Project in 1995. However the main objective of that project was to prevent farmers doing cultivation within reservations of natural streams. Under that project, trees such as Kumbuk, Karanda and Bamboo were introduced to the water edge of streams and fruit trees were established at the edge of reservations bordering paddy fields. Farmers adjacent to streams (riparian farmers) enjoyed the user right of trees planted bordering their boundary. These riparian belts were also designed to play a role of bio corridors connecting isolated forest patches within agriculture landscapes.
Implementation phase usually is three years until the newly planted riparian trees are fully established. Jogging part covers only a short stretch of the river bank. Balance is a riparian bio corridor. Maintenance of the jogging path sections is a responsibility of local authorities.
There is no need to maintain balance section after three years, because it will become a part of the nature with time. However, if the jogging section is not maintained it will also eventually transform into a bio corridor and the community will miss the chance of reaping benefits of the project. Therefore community also will have a responsibility to maintain it by organizing themselves or through local institutes such as Urban Councils.
Local authorities such as Urban Council of Gampaha are capable of doing maintenance. That is their responsibility.
This is a new challenge for them especially because jogging path is becoming very popular among taxpayers who finance the salaries of those councils. Average number of visitors per day for Gampaha is more than 100. For Kiribathgoda it is even more. Therefore recreation is a need of urban community. May be, councils could get lessons from other countries to address the new challenge. In my view the political leaderships of our local bodies such as Urban Councils should be creative enough to raise funds for such community-oriented projects by involving private sector institutes, companies and banks within their command area. Those institutes have a social responsibility of supporting local institutes such as Urban Councils.
Climate change
Fresh water availability is becoming gradually diminishing in whole world. Though Gampaha is located in wet zone, global issues such climate change affects this region too. The statement of King Parakramabahu not to send a drop of water to sea without using is applicable to Gampaha too.
The present approach adapted by SLRDC focusing only the flood mitigation should be revised addressing the issues during drought situations too.
For that, there is need to have joint effort of Water Board, Environment Authority and Irrigation Department. This project provided ideal stage to deliver their services in broader prospective addressing the community needs in a holistic way because rivers and natural stream belong to the whole community. What the community needs is a service addressing whole cross section of them in multi-disciplinary way rather than restricting to a single objective.
Unless political leadership digests the importance of preserving natural environment, nothing will materialise. The role of implementation agency in coordinating various agencies responsible for water resource (Irrigation Dept, Agrarian) is also important.

Joseph Stalin: Psychopathology of a dictator
Joseph Stalin was one of the main architects of creating a collective trauma in the Soviet Union. His actions and policies brought immense suffering to the people. The aftermath of Stalins repression still impacts the post Soviet Society. However despite all the negative consequences Stalin is still remembered in Russia as a great hero who saved the Soviet Union from Hitlers Fascist aggression and transformed the country in to a super power. The Stalinist past still shapes the Russian society today (Gouldner 2009). A survey commissioned by the Carnegie Endowment in 2012, suggested that Soviet dictator Josef Stalin has remained widely admired in Russia and other former Soviet nations (The Moscow Times, 2013).
Some historians and social scientists have considered the Soviet regime under Joseph Stalin during the 1930s to be the embodiment of totalitarianism, a term which describes a political system in which power is concentrated at the top and the entire population is mobilized to undertake a sweeping transformation of society (Schmaltz, 2007).
A regime of terror
Joseph Stalin was the leader of the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953 ruled the country with an iron fist. According to Professor Harold Shukman of all the dictators the world endured in the twentieth century, Joseph Stalin was unquestionably the mightiest. Nisbet (1986) describes Joseph Stalin as a low-born revolutionist and bandit from early years, successor by sheer ruthlessness to Lenin as absolute ruler of the Soviet Union, liquidator of the Kulak class in the Ukraine, purger of his own party and totalitarian to the core.
Joseph Stalins political strategy to construct socialism is known as Stalinism. Stalinist policies in the Soviet Union included: state terror, authoritarianism, rapid industrialization and the theory of socialism in one country, a centralized state and collectivization of agriculture (Bottomore, 1991). According to Gouldner (2009) Stalinism is historically analyzed as a regime of terror in furtherance of a property transfer which utilized a personal dictatorship and a burgeoning bureaucracy.
Many Soviet and the international politicians observed certain abnormal traits in Stalins character. Vladimir Ilyich Lenin saw Stalin as a rude unsympathetic person. Leon Trotsky noticed Stalins unstable emotions. Nikolai Bukharin identified his insatiable desire for power disregarding moral values. Among the international politicians Winston Churchill become aware of Stalins coldness when he laughed and joked about the killing of hundreds of thousands of Soviet Kulaks while dining with him in 1942 at the Yalta conference. The Yugoslav Communist politician Milovan ilas perceived inappropriate humour, sycophancy, vulgarity and extreme manipulativeness in Stalin.
Mental capacity of Joseph Stalin was questioned by the Soviet and the foreign experts. Dr. Vladimir Bekhterev detected paranoid symptoms in Stalin in 1927. Stalins physician Dr. Alexander Myasnikov who treated him in 1953 believed that atherosclerosis of the cerebral arteries caused abnormal behaviour and impaired judgment in the Soviet dictator. There are a number of theories that intensely discuss Stalins terrorizing behaviour and long lasting paranoia. As indicated by Birt (1993) paranoia often begins during childhood in a situation in which the child feels both dependent on and threatened by the father. Birt (1993) further states that severe emotional ambivalence that Stalin experienced in his childhood may have caused lasting impact on him.
Physical and psychological distresses
Stalin was born in 1879 in Gori -Georgia. His real name was Joseph Djugashvili. Stalin had a turbulent childhood. As a young child Stalin underwent severe physical and psychological distresses that affected his adult life in huge capacity. His father Vissarion (Beso) Djugashvili was a cobbler and an alcoholic. His clients paid him partly in wine which was so plentiful in Georgia that many workers received alcohol instead of cash. Furthermore, he did some business in the corner of a friends dukhan (tavern), which encouraged him to drink too much (Montefiore, 2007). He was a violent man and was killed in a bar fight.
Stalin feared his alcoholic father who physically and verbally abused him and his mother. Brackman (2003) states that the neighbours long remembered Vissarions brutal beatings of the boy and on one occasion out of rage Vissarion threw a hammer at the boy, barely missing him. Stalin frequently witnessed family violence. At the age of nine little Stalin was sent to a workshop to work as a child labourer by his father. When he refused to work he was severely punished by Vissarion. Since his childhood he had unresolved psychological conflicts with his father. Stalin's violent tendencies developed in part due to his father's behaviour (Stal, 2013).
Stalin never received the love that he expected from his mother. His mother Yekaterina Geladze was an illiterate woman. She wanted Stalin to become a priest. He was sent to a Seminary in Tbilisi. But young Stalin was expelled from the Seminary due to his poor performance and for reading Marxist books.
The Seminary life made a huge impact on his life in the later years. He frequently underwent physical beatings by the priests. He saw their double standards and found nothing sacred in life itself. Progressively he was captivated by reading Charles Darwin and Karl Marx.
Toward the end of 1898, Stalins relations with seminary officials became increasingly hostile. He refused to bow to the inspector, who complained to the Board of Supervisors. An entry in the Seminarys records states that in the course of a search of the fifth-grade dormitories, Iosif Dzhugashvili tried several times to enter into an argument with seminary officials, expressing dissatisfaction with the repeated searches of students, and declaring that such searches were never made in other seminaries. What the record book fails to mention is that Kobas (Stalins) actions were directly responsible for the search. Koba tried to induce some of his fellow students to drop out of the Seminary and join the revolutionary underground (Brackman, 2003).
Stalins mother Yekaterina Geladze
Stalin grew up alone and he had no siblings. His mother gave birth to three children who either died in early infancy or were stillborn. In later years she once mentioned that she had two sons and another time she spoke of three babies, which suggests that one of them was a girl. The causes of their deaths and even their names remain unknown (Brackman, 2003).
Stalin had attachment problems with his mother. (According to some sources Stalins mother had an affair with his God father Yakov Egnatashvili and Stalins real father was not Vissarion Djugashvili the cobbler). Stalins mother used to work in David Pismamedovs house. Pismamedov was a Jewish businessman in Gori and some residents suspected an illicit affair between David Pismamedov and Stalins mother Yekaterina Geladze.

MR needs human shield like Prabhakaran

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa needs a human shield just like late LTTE Leader Prabhakaran did during the last stages of the war, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Soysa said.
Addressing media during a press briefing at the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry in Colombo yesterday he said military personnel cannot be provided to the former President to travel around the country to topple the government. Military protection cannot be provided to the former President because there is no war in the country now. Only police protection can be provided to him similar to any other politician as in any other country.
According to Minister Soysa, the SLFP Central Committee took a decision to let a section of the SLFP to remain in the opposition because the government is not completely an SLFP led government and there is a need for an opposition. But holding two separate May Day rallies cannot be approved on any ground. The SLFP lost two elections because of racism and there will be no transactions between the SLFP and racists in future.
Minister Soysa pointed out that the National Government will continue for a certain period to achieve certain targets and thereafter the leaders of the two main political parties will decide whether to continue the partnership or to go on their separate paths.
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga governed the country with one majority seat with the assistance of the JVP and the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa took 18 UNP MPs to the government to end the war.
This is not the first time it happened in the country's history.

Mahinda Rajapaksa is the only leader in the world who defeated the most powerful terrorist organization. Therefore, Rajapaksa should be given proper military protection, MP Gunawardena said.
On an earlier occasion, attempts were made to withdraw Mahinda Rajapaksa's security detail.

"But, when Joint Opposition objected and the Leader of the House responded and said that the security would not be withdrawn in a manner that would put the former President's life in danger.
MP Gunawardena said that proving the Leader of the House's statement, the government has ordered that the Army security detail of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa be withdrawn.
Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa also spoke on the occasion.

Lanka hope to take on England with fearless approach : Thirimanne doubtful starter for first Test


On paper Sri Lanka looks like a Test team of no-hopers for their tour of England which begins at the end of the week with a three-day game against Essex at Chelmsford. That is because the side lacks the experience that is required to survive under early English conditions.
However skipper Angelo Mathews feels that what they lack by way of experience his young side can overcome by their fearless approach with which they are capable of playing their cricket.
When you have a young and inexperienced side you have nothing to lose but go out there and perform, thats what the team will do. The key is their
fearless attitude to take up the challenge and deliver, said Mathews whose team will embark to England tomorrow.
We came close to beating New Zealand twice and we won the Test series against West Indies. This team has the potential to perform and win. The two warm-up games will be crucial for us to acclimatize ourselves to the conditions we are going to come up against. We are going into two extremes of temperatures from the high we have been experiencing at home to almost freezing point in England. The need to adjust very quickly to the changes is the key. If we can do that we can overcome a major hurdle, he said.
Sri Lanka will take on England in a series of three Tests starting with the first at Headingley, Leeds on May 19. It is a venue that will evoke fond memories for Mathews and eight others in the present squad when they turned tables on England with a last gasp win by 100 runs. That victory gave Sri Lanka the series 1-0 and it was the first time they achieved that milestone in their history.
Mathews had a memorable series scoring a hundred in his first appearance at Lords, a Test that Sri Lanka escaped with a draw with their last pair at the wicket. He followed it up with a monumental 160 at Leeds, an innings that laid the foundation for that historic win.
Mathews achieved both Test career best performances in that series with the bat (160) and with the ball (4/44).
It was my first tour of England and I managed to adjust to the conditions and come out on top. I expect the same with the present crop of players most of whom are alien to English conditions, said Mathews.
I am quite confident we can achieve the same result this time around. I know that we are a bit on the inexperienced side without the likes of Sanga (Kumar Sangakkara) and Mahela (Jayawardene) but I wont say that batting is the weak point maybe in experience, yes. This team is prepared to take on anyone with their fearless approach.
Mathews said that he would not put too much pressure on himself as captain. There is always pressure when you play. I wouldnt let captaincy affect my batting or bowling.
Mathews with 58 Test caps and left-arm spinner Rangana Herath with 67 are the only players in the team who have made over 50 Test appearances for their country. Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal, Dhammika Prasad, Shaminda Eranga, Nuwan Pradeep and Dilruwan Perera along with Mathews and Herath were members of the 2014 Test side that toured England.
The two warm-up games (against Essex and Leicestershire ahead of the Test series) Mathews said will be used to fill a few slots in the batting order.
We will try to play a fixed side and make sure the players are given permanent positions, said Mathews. But at this point of time Dimuth (Karunaratne) and Kaushal (Silva) will be our openers and the number three spot will be occupied by either Kusal Mendis who is shaping up well or Niroshan Dickwella.
Lahiru (Thirimanne) is recovering from a hamstring injury which he first picked up in New Zealand and if he is fit he will play in the first Test. We need his experience in the batting.
Thirimanne is battling with a personal problem to come to terms with his cricket and at the moment is going through a lean period with his bat. Mathews was confident that he will come good during the England tour.
Preparations for the tour have been good I am very happy the way we have gone about it, said Mathews. We left a lot of grass on the pitches we practiced and we started practices very early in the morning so that the bowlers were able to get some swing on the ball especially up in Pallekele.

SRI LANKA TEST SQUAD: Angelo Mathews (Captain), Dinesh Chandimal (Vice-Captain), Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva, Lahiru Thirimanne, Kusal Mendis, Niroshan Dickwella, Milinda Siriwardana, Dhammika Prasad, Shaminda Eranga, Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal, Dushmantha Chameera, Rangana Herath, Dilruwan Perera, Dhananjaya de Silva and Dasun Shanaka.

Leicester striker Vardy gets top award

London, Monday: Leicester City forward Jamie Vardy has been voted the 2016 Footballer of the Year by the Football Writers' Association (FWA), it was announced Monday.
The 29-year-old striker took the award as a clear winner ahead of team-mates Riyad Mahrez, who had already taken the Player of the Year award voted on by his fellow professionals, and N'Golo Kante.
Vardy has scored 24 goals for club and country so far this season as the Foxes close in on what would be a remarkable Premier League title triumph.
They will be crowned champions should closest rivals Tottenham Hotspur fail to beat Chelsea on Monday.
In total seven Leicester players received votes in the FWA poll, with Danny Drinkwater, goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, captain Wes Morgan and Danny Simpson also receiving votes.
Vardy will be honoured with the prestigious FWA accolade, which has been running since 1948, at a gala dinner in London on May 12.
FWA chairman Andy Dunn, of the Sunday Mirror, said: "It is testament to their all-round excellence that so many Leicester players polled votes from our members. The Jamie Vardy story, though, clearly captured the imagination of so many writers.
"His record-breaking feat of scoring in 11 consecutive matches is the jewel in what will surely be Leicester's Premier League crown.
"And the Footballer of the Year award is not just a reflection of his fantastic season, but recognition of a remarkable journey from non-league to the international stage."
Other players to receive votes from FWA members were Tottenham striker Harry Kane, West Ham playmaker Dimitri Payet, Manchester City duo Sergio Aguero and Kevin de Bruyne as well as Spurs midfielder Dele Alli.

Mark Selby leads Ding Junhui in final

LONDON , MONDAY: World number one Mark Selby held off Ding Junhui's fightback to lead 10-7 after a marathon first day of the best-of-35 World Championship final.
The Englishman took advantage of a nervous Ding to open up a 6-0 lead, before Ding pulled two back.
China's Ding had breaks of 103, 89 and 86 in the second session, as well as taking a 66-minute 15th frame.
But Selby, the 2014 champion, won the last two as play ended at 00:24 BST after a tactical 49-minute final frame.
The final resumes on Monday, with the last session due to start at 19:00 GMT. Leicester's Selby, competing in his third final, looked fresh despite a late semi-final finish against Marco Fu on Saturday, and took advantage of Ding's edginess early on.
Having not shown his best snooker in the tournament, the 32-year-old signalled his intention with breaks of 91, 76, 70 and 120 to surge ahead.
However, his opponent - playing in his first Crucible final - won the seventh and eighth frames to stay in touch. Ding, 29, had to come through three qualifying matches to qualify for the main draw after slipping to 17th in the world rankings.
He is bidding to become only the third qualifier after Terry Griffiths in 1979 and Shaun Murphy in 2005 to lift the trophy, and the first Asian world champion.
Selby looked like he might run away with the final when he won the first frame of the second session, but he suffered an unfortunate miscue when in amongst the reds in the next.
That gave Ding a reprieve as he jumped out of his seat to make a counter-attacking 76 break.
He followed it up with a century, his 13th of the tournament, and a cool 89 under pressure to reduce the deficit to 7-5.
Ding grabbed two of the next three, including the marathon 15th frame to go 8-7 behind, but it seemed to take a lot out of him.

LG polls early next year: Faiszer
The Local Government polls will be held early next year once the delimitation process is completed, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha said.
The SLFP or the government does not fear holding the LG elections as said by some at May Day rallies, he said at a press briefing in Colombo yesterday.
Musthapha said holding LG polls according to the old system without completing the delimitation process was going against the peoples mandate given to President Maithripala Sirisena during the Presidential election.
The minister said even the UPFA General Secretary wanted to hold the LG polls soon as the UPFA had the advantage of winning the election.
It cannot be done as protecting peoples democratic rights is more important than following time frames. There are over 2,000 complaints with the Delimitation Commission. Some ethnicities do not have a representation in some electorates, he said. Minister Mustapha said one more month will be given to the commission from August 1 to complete its work.
Delimitation should be done for more than 1,000 electorates. I do not interfere with the committee which is represented by all political parties. Nobody was against holding LG polls according to the new system when the issues was taken up in Parliament, he said.

Speaker calls for report on Parliament clash
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday assigned Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala and Deputy Chairman of Committees Selvam Adaikkilanathan to hold an investigation into yesterdays brawl in Parliament and submit a report
of the investigations immediately. He added that upon receipt of the report, he would take action against the MPs responsible for the incident.
Speaker Jayasuriya made these observations in Parliament soon after sittings resumed after the MPs resorted to fisticuffs over the reduction of security provided to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The Speaker condemned the conduct of MPs who exchanged blows in the Well of Parliament.
He added that when this unfortunate incident that affected the dignity and esteem of Parliament took place, there were large number of people including schoolchildren in the public gallery.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe responded to a question raised by Dinesh Gunawardena on the security of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Speaker said. The Prime Minister invited Field Marshal Minister Sarath Fonseka who had a expert knowledge on security matters, to further explain the matter. He said that when Field Marshal Fonseka was explaining the matter a group of MPs entered the Well creating unrest and that led to ugly incidents where some MPs exchanged blows.
Thereafter I suspended sittings and convened a meeting of the Parliamentary Affairs Working Committee to discuss this incident, the Speaker said. All members of the committee unanimously condemned the incident. The Speaker said that he instructed the Deputy Speaker and the Deputy Chairman of Committees to investigate the incident and submit a report immediately.
Upon the receipt of that report I would take action against the MPs responsible for the incident. As you all know I have taken an initiative to introduce a Code of Conduct for MPs and informed you of that initiative during the last parliament session, the Speaker said. I have received reports that one MP has been hospitalised and several others were injured in this incident.
