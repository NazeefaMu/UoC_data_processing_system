Bradby the most looked forward to game
In our country rugby is not something that generally springs readily to mind. It is better known for cricket, tea exports and the recently ended civil war. But Sri Lankas British colonial forefathers left behind more than cricket as a sporting staple.
Rugby was introduced to Sri Lanka in the late 1800s, and today it boasts a large playing population and a television audience of millions.
The Bradby Shield encounter - popularly called The Bradby - is the highlight of the Sri Lankas schools rugby calendar. It is played annually between traditional rivals Royal College, Colombo, and Trinity College, Kandy. The encounter consists of two legs, one being played in Colombo, and the other in Kandy.
The winner is decided on the aggregate of the scores from these two matches, usually played a few weeks apart. The Bradby was generally played in late July or early August and is the most watched rugby match in the country, drawing more spectators than either inter-club or even international fixtures.
The first historic match was played on July 31, 1920. This was made a yearly encounter, with Trinity winning for the first in 21 years. In 1945, the principal of Royal College, E. L Bradby, put forward the idea of playing an annual two-match series, to which the principal of Trinity College C.E. Simithraarachy, readily agreed. To ensure the success of the series, Principal E.L. Bradby offered a shield which was to be held for a period of one year by the winner of the series. The series has been played annually and uninterrupted ever since.
Two land marks in this historic series prior to the 1945 are  Royals first ever win over Trinity was in 1941, their victories over Trinity in the first two match series was in 1943  the 2nd match bringing Royal their first win in Kandy.
The Shield is a wooden disk decorated with intricate workings depicting traditional Kandyan art and craftsmanship. On winning the series, the Shield is presented to the winning teams captain at an award ceremony held on the playing field immediately following the end of the second leg.
The first Bradby Shield teams: Trinity - A. Ratwatte, S. Mediwake, A. Yatawara, J. Kuruwita, P.S. Dedigama, T.B. Madugalle, S.B. Pilapitiya, R.G. Sourja (Capt), H. Jones, R. Vanculenberg, G. Sanmugam, H. Ranasinghe, R.V. Moottsam, K.A. Gunawardene, W.Thurasitratnam. Royal - M. Kassipillai, R.M.S. de Silva, A.C.M. Nizar, N.W. Karunaratne, U. Amerasinghe, R. Rajaratnam, M. Rodrigo, D.R. Amerasinghe, J.M. Cumaraswamy, L. Kumarasinghe, D de Moor, F.D Schoorman, C,D.L. Fernando (Capt), T. Mukherjee, S.V. Edirimanasinghe. Royal won 3-0 the first leg played in Colombo. Referee Sydney G. de Zoysa.
Sad day for Rahul
Trinity skipper Rahul Karunathilake after two yellow cards in the Thomian game has been barred from playing in the first leg of the Bradby. This may be the first time that a captain has been deprived of playing. What a sad affair.
Kandy Gateway wins at basketball
Gateway College Kandy, which gets a big hand for sports under principal Asoka Herath beat De La Salle College Mutwal by 70 points to 45 in a under 17 All-Island B division basketball game. Kandy schools did well due to the good work of Shevon Jayaweera and Navidyu Weerasinghe who scored 23 and 18 points each respectively.
Pujith Jayasundara started his sports in Kandy
Pujith Senadhi Bandara Jayasundara who took office as the 34th Inspector General of Police was a fine sportsman. He played cricket for Dharmaraja College as an opening batsman and was also a top bowler. He played for the Rajans for four years. He was also an athlete, hockey player and footballer. He represented the Police at cricket, football and hockey. A keen follower of sports, he believes that sports are the great leveler and the best medicine for policemen and the public to understand each other.
Pujith had his primary education at Thaksala Maha Vidyalaya in Mahamukalanyaya in Bogamuwa. At grade five he was admitted to Ibbagamuwa Central, after few months he came over to Dharmaraja College. After his playing days, he gave big support for Police sports, especially football, hockey, cricket and basketball. At one time he was a livewire of the Sri Lanka Football Federation.
Kandy Police to bring back sports
Kandy Police who dominated sports like football, hockey, cricket, and volleyball and cue sport are keen to promote them again. They have their own sports ground which has helped many sportsmen and sportswomen in and around Kandy for the last 75 years.
For this idea a big hand should go to all the top Police officers past and present who were in Kandy. They were all sports lovers who helped most of the schools like Dharmaraja College, Kingswood College, Vidyartha College, and St. Sylvesters College and St. Pauls College (now Sri Sumangala) to perform all their sports, specially cricket, football, hockey and athletics. In the early days Police Constable S.M. David was in charge. The first game of hockey was played at this ground in 1905 when it was under the Army and known as the Army Barracks.
Kandy Sports Club getting ready for 7s
The inter-club rugby sevens considered the premier tournament on the SLRFU calendar is expected to be held in August spanning two days. Defending champions Kandy Sports Club will be fielding a strong side, and the chairman of rugby at Nittawela Lasantha Wijesuriya said that practices will start soon after the Mercantile Sevens. The club sevens has proved to be a fertile ground for nurturing young players who go on to make it in the 15-man game.
Old Sylvestrians to organize seven-a-side rugby
Old Sylvestrians Sports Club are keen to organize a sevens rugby tournament in Kandy among the Kandy schools.
Its going to be a one day tournament and will be played at Bogambara or Nittawella. OBA president J G.Tilakasiri and Sports Club president U.S.K. Kodithuwakku with the rest are going all-out to make this event a grand one.

Own goal  Africas shambolic sports management
The call for better management of sport is heard across Africa - often as a lament, more regularly as an outburst of barely contained frustration.
In football, former Ajax and Juventus defender Sunday Oliseh recently quit as Nigerias national football coach, citing contractual violations and lack of support from his local federation. Months earlier, Zimbabwe were disqualified from the 2018 World Cup qualifying tournament after its football association failed to pay a former national coach..
In athletics, Kenya only recently averted the threat of disqualification from the 2016 Olympic Games because of its previously long-standing failure to implement robust drugs-testing procedures - nearly 40 athletes have failed tests in the last four years.
And yet Kenya would surely be far better protecting what is regarded as one of its greatest assets - indeed, impressing on the top table of global sport is recognised as a surefire way of propelling a little-known nation on to the planets psyche.
It is thanks to football that small countries can become great, beamed footballer Roger Milla after his Cameroon side because the first African nation to reach a World Cup quarter-finals in 1990. So given the global standing that countries can achieve through sport - not to mention the political capital that a ruling party can gain through overseeing such success - are African administrators doing enough to ensure success
Embarrassing
With a host of different disciplines in Africas 54 countries, it is wise to avoid generalisations, but a potted look at some recent issues suggests significant problems abound.
Demonstrating athletes in Kenya held up placards demanding reform
During the 2014 football World Cup qualifying campaign, seven African countries forfeited matches after they were found to have fielded ineligible players - an administrative oversight that only one other country across the rest of the world managed to repeat.
One of the most embarrassing moments in South African sporting history - and there have been a few - came when the football association president publicly congratulated his players for qualifying for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations - when his organisations misunderstanding of the rules meant they had erroneously played for a draw when they needed a win. They did not qualify.
Then take Nigeria - Africas biggest population and arguably the continents most football-crazed nation - which has failed to qualify for three of the last four Africa Cup of Nations tournaments. Yet this has little to do with the quality of Nigerias players - as proven by the fact that the Super Eagles won the trophy in 2013, either side of these qualifying failures - and more to do with administration.
This last qualifying campaign featured three coaches in the space of 12 months and endless accusations and counter-accusations between the coaching staff and Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). At the same time, a row over who is actually in charge of the NFF has led to the threat of a ban by footballs world governing body Fifa - not for the first time.
Then last week, the embarrassing scenario whereby one of the officials announced for a local fixture was found to have actually died a few months earlier.
Repeated threats
Kenya has not only been in trouble with the world athletics governing body for its slovenly pace in dealing with anti-doping. Senior athletics officials have been suspended by the IAAF while an investigation takes place into allegations of subversion of the anti-doping process and the improper diversion of funds received from Nike. Allegations the officials deny. And while the East African nation has finally passed a law to bring its anti-doping programme up to scratch, this was only achieved after repeated threats from the World Anti-Doping Agency and the IAAF.
Amidst the endless negativity of bonus rows, coaches not being paid on time, funds going missing, match-fixing scandals and insufficient stadium security, there are some positive stories. The Algerian Football Federation of a generation ago deserves special mention as a proactive sports administration. For years it pushed Fifa into changing rules on player eligibility and then, in 2004, it was the first to profit as Antar Yahia became the first footballer to represent one nation at junior level (France) before playing for a different one at senior level (Algeria).
After the rule change, the North Africans qualified for the 2010 World Cup, their first finals in a quarter of a century, thanks to fielding a squad dominated by former French youth internationals - with Yahia scoring the dramatic qualifying goal..
More recently, Kenyas Rugby Sevens won their first World Series title by thumping defending champions Fiji in the final in Singapore.The result was built on a lot of hard work and determination, with Kenya having been to well over 100 tournaments before this first success.
The silverware finally shone a light on those endeavours but some African sporting associations, however well run, will never get that chance.
Without a trophy, which does not always have to be the only marker of progress, their deeds go unnoticed.
Cronyism
And you can bet that they will share one major gripe - which is that football dominates the budgetary attention of a nations sports ministry to the detriment of all other disciplines. This is certainly one area that needs to be addressed if Africa is to advance, for those that are leading the way in less prominent sports are often doing so without the assistance of any federation.
A case in point would be Cameroons Francoise Mbango, one of only two female athletes to have won back-to-back Olympic golds despite giving birth in-between.
The triple jumper achieved her successes in 2004 and 2008 through her own indomitable spirit, training with her sister in Paris because of the negligible assistance from the Cameroonian authorities.
She has since changed her national allegiance to France.
The relative paucity of good African sports administrators also lies in the fact that many of them only go into the job to make money or gain a public profile on which to launch a political career - rather than for the love of sport itself.
In South Africa, many of those who have run football over the last two decades are former freedom fighters who were rewarded by the African National Congress (ANC) with lucrative posts in sport - albeit one that did not always reflect their abilities.
The result has been a steady decline in the fortunes of Bafana Bafana.
Sea of apathy
One of the most interesting aspects to the Kenyan doping story was the role played by the athletes themselves, who occupied the headquarters of the governing body Athletics Kenya last November to demand change.
Many argue for the presence of more former sportsmen on boards to improve administration, but it is hard to judge if this would work until more get involved.
The efforts of one certainly leave little to be desired.
Back in the 1950s, Senegals Lamine Diack was a long jumper with unrealised Olympic ambitions; but he did make it to the top of athletics, running the IAAF between 1999 and 2015.
Whatever he achieved in that long reign is now overshadowed by the most serious of allegations faced by any sports administrator - that he knowingly overlooked doping infringements in exchange for bribes, or personal profit.
He is being investigated by French police and denies the accusations.
So it is little wonder that so many athletes fail to reach the top or simply leave the continent altogether - take Nigerian sprinter Francis Obikwelu as an example.
In 2000, he injured himself while representing his nation at the Sydney Olympics.
In the days and months that followed, the sprinter was so angered by the care he received - he had to pay for his own knee surgery amid a sea of administrative apathy - that he switched his national allegiance to Portugal.
Four years later, Obikwelu showed Nigeria what might have been as he became the first Portuguese to ever win an Olympic medal, taking silver in no less an event than the mens 100m.
It is a tale that encapsulates perhaps the most frustrating aspect for devotees of African sport - namely, the nagging thought of what could be achieved by the continents sportsmen and women should their ability be harnessed in the right way.

Tamil Unions march to the Premier league championships
Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Clubs first eleven cricketers bathed themselves in glory by winning Sri Lanka Crickets Premier League Trophy in the extended version of the game. Tamil Union also was runners-up to Army SC in the T20 tournament this season.
This win was achieved after the club won the then equivalent - the inaugural P. Saravanamuttu Trophy in 1950/51 under Sathi Coomaraswamy. So, a 65-year wait was finally ended.
Tamil Union has had two close calls in 1982/83 under S. Skandakumar when they were pipped to the post on a matter of 0.15 points by Bloomfield C & AC, and then again in 1998/99, when under the captaincy of Upul Chandana, they could not claim the last Sebastianites CC wicket in the entire final session and ended as runner-up.
There have been numerous Premier League limited overs championship wins in the interim  the last one being under Sajit Fernando in 2009/10. There have been unprecedented Under-23 tournament wins, including four in the last five years  including a hat-trick - but this is the grand-daddy of them all!
The team was led by Tamil Unions own home-grown talent Sri Lankan fast bowler Suranga Lakmal.
Suranga had extremely humble beginnings, hailing from Debarawewa, near Hambantota.
Discovered while playing for the local school, he was picked by Mahinda College, Galle, where he performed outstandingly that he was picked to attend Sri Lanka Crickets fast bowling camp. Champaka Ramanayake, SLCs fast bowling coach, felt that Surangas interests would be best served under the nurturing gaze of the Tamil Union.
Surangas home for the first few seasons was in Tamil Unions Cricketers Hostel, which the club maintains expressly for the purpose of providing a home for the youngsters needing accommodation; fed and watered in The Big Smoke that is Colombo. At any given time, there are ten cricketers staying with Tamil Union. Several of them have gone on to sport National colours at various levels, and the club is proud of its contribution to Sri Lankas cricket.
There are many other national cricketers in the club team, although many of them could not play the entire season due to national commitments.
Among them are the legendary T.M. Dilshan and Rangana Herath, leg-spinning all-rounder Jeewan Mendis, Test opener Tharanga Paranavitarana, young guns Dhananjaya de Silva, Kithuruwan Vithanage and Ramith Rambukwella, along with paceman Shaminda Eranga. Several others, like fast bowler Nisala Tharaka and batsman Pabasara Waduge have represented Sri Lanka at A team level. Fast bowling all-rounder Charith Jayampathi and leg-spinning all-rounder Pulina Tharanga (a tsunami survivor, also completely home-grown!) are burgeoning national prospects.
Also in the ranks are former school captains Dinuk Wickremanayake (Trinity), Devind Pathmanathan (Royal), Madhushan Ravichandrakumar (S. Thomas), Sithara Gimhan (Richmond), Imal Liyanage (Royal) and Chamika Karunaratne (Royal) and wicket-keeper batsman Manoj Sarathchandra (St Anthonys, Kandy).
Others who played this season were fast bowler Pramod Liyanagamage, batsman Isuru Buddhika and left-arm tear-away Isuru Prashan.
The team was coached by Kapila Weerasinghe, with manager Mahesh Bopage providing outstanding logistical support.
During the season, Tamil Union played six games in the first round won two outright, two on first innings, one draw and one loss. In the Super 8 stage of the tournament, Tamil Union played four games, with outright wins against NCC, SSC, Colts and Galle  probably the strongest teams in the competition.
In terms of individual performances, in batting Tharanga Paranavitana led the way with an aggregate of 953 runs (avg. 79.41), Dhananjaya de Silva made 858 runs (avg. 54.25) and Jeewan Mendis 574 runs (avg. 47.83).
In bowling, Dhananjaya was the highest wicket-taker with 34 wickets, with Jeewan running a close second on 32 wickets.
It is expected that Tharanga and Dhananjaya will be awarded Best Batsman and Best All-rounder respectively at the Sri Lanka Cricket Awards presentation to be held later in the year, as they have performed the best in the League.
The Club is very proud of this achievement and wishes to thank its President, Secretary, Committee Members, and, in particular those involved in the Cricket Administration over the past few years, without whom this long-cherished goal could not have been achieved.

Trinity goes out favourites but Royal can surprise
Rugby fans could expect to witness a tremendously exciting game when underdogs Royal College Colombo, come up against firm favourites Trinity College Kandy, in the first leg of the Singer Sri Lanka sponsored 72nd Bradby Shield rugby encounter which will be played at the Royal College Sports Complex at Reid Avenue commencing 4.30 p.m.
Playing on their home turf should give Royal the advantage yet, the outcome of a Trinity-Royal Bradby game is most unpredictable. The Simithrarachchci Trophy for the juniors will precede the big event and take place at 3.30 p.m.
Royal has a strong, mobile, pack of forwards, while Trinitys strength lies in their versatile, fleet footed three-quarter line. Possession and handling of the ball will be key factors and to what good purpose they use it, will surely determine the outcome of this game.
Trinity College will be led by fly half and stand in skipper Thisila Perera due to the suspension of their appointed captain and durable Sri Lanka under 19 Junior National second row forward Rahul Karunatilaka, who has led the Lions from the front this season.
Trinity have played four matches so far, winning three and losing their unbeaten run last week to S Thomas College Mount Lavinia, where they lost by 23 points to 20 at Pallekelle after a thrilling encounter. Their wins have been over Wesley College Colombo 7-5, St. Josephs College Maradana 40-14 and they put up their best performance for the season by virtually thrashing hapless D.S. Senanayake College 65-0.
Meanwhile the Royal outfit beat D.S. Senanayake 36-10, Wesley 17-14 and their only loss was against arch rivals S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia by 21 points to 15, a match they should have won if not for complacency getting the better of them and then coming from behind 10-24 down to hold the fighting St. Josephs team to a spectacular 27-all draw last week.
Royal will be led by that hard working Sri Lanka under 19 Junior National prop forward Nikila Gunadheera, a fine leader who led the side in an exemplary manner. In full back Ovin Askey they have a fine place kicker who could tilt the game in their favour with his spot-on kicking. Royals only blemish is their defence which has been suspect many times this season.
72nd Bradby
This is the 72nd year since the Bradby started in 1945, when Royal was led by Dr. C.D.L. Fernando and Trinity by Dr. Robert Sourjah. Royal won the 1st Leg 3-nil in Colombo and in the 2nd Leg up in Kandy, Trinity clinched the Shield with a 6nil victory.
Trinity has won the Bradby 39 times and Royal 31  but in 1992 it was a tie with a nil-all result in the first leg and a 3-all draw in the second leg. Trinity was led by a cricketer turn rugby player skipper Himesh Goonetilleke and Royal were led Harindu Wijesinghe, now a specialist orthopedic doctor.
Royal highest aggregate score was 83 points in 2002, spearheaded by Zulkie Hameed; while Trinitys highest aggregate was obtained in 2012 with 70 points. They were led by that brilliant centre three quarter Kaneel Seneviratne who has won two Lions.
Royal is the present custodian of the Bradby Shield having won it last year under the captaincy of centre Bhanuka Gamage by an aggregate of 7222. The first leg played at Trinity grounds in Pallekelle saw the Royalists earn a hard fought 2322 win but they crushed the Lions by the biggest margin of 49-nil in the second leg played at Royal Sports Complex, Colombo.
Trinity won the Bradby for six years in a row, from 1952 captained by Mervyn Panditharatne to 1957 captained by Ken de Joodt, while in 1971, Royal under the captaincy of F.R. Perera, won the first leg by 22 points to 3 but due to civil disturbances in the country, the second leg was not played. Trinitys Principal Lionel Fernando magnanimously decided that he would award the Bradby Shield to Royal and it was accepted as one of the finest sporting gestures. The Principal of Trinity travelled down to Colombo and awarded the Bradby Shield to the Royal captain at the schools General Assembly.
Father and son as captain
It may be a matter of interest, to know that Ashan Ratwatte was the Captain and Lion, an outstanding scrum-half of Trinity in 1983 (100th encounter between both schools), when they won the Bradby, winning 14-6 and losing 6-10 with an aggregate score of 20 points to16. He later went on to represent the Sri Lanka national team as a scrum half. Ashan is the proud father of Tarinda Ratwatte, Trinitys outstanding fly-half cum skipper of 2014 who went on to equal his fathers record by winning 37-25 and losing 9-13 with an aggregate score of 46-38 to win the Bradby as well as the Lion. Incidentally they are todate remain as the only father and son ever to captain and win the Bradby Shield for their respective schools.
Its a great joy
Any young or old Royalist or Trinitian, who took to the game of rugby in school would always say that it was their boyhood dream to wear the school rugby jersey and one day play in the Bradby Shield encounter!
Its a great joy to know that both the present Principals of these two great institutions share the same views on maintaining its past glory, befitting the schools that they love. It is not only important to win but to also focus on fair play and good sportsmanship. It is these qualities that ensure the spirit of the game and cherished, now and for future generations.
In todays game it is hoped that Rugby will be the Victor of this great Bradby battle.
May it also be a memorable match for all rugby fans irrespective of which school they come from that they may all say None can match the Bradby.
Royal Colleges unbeaten 1978 rugby captain, former CR & FC skipper and Sri Lanka national rugby player Rohantha Peiris will be the chief guest and will be introduced to the two teams before the commencement of the match. (WAI)

Sensational Pathana overcome Science
Isipathana College staged a spectacular display of running rugby to down Science College Mount Lavinia by 29 points (4 tries, 3 conversions, 1 penalty) to 23 (3 tries, 1 conversion, 2 penalties) in their Singer inter-school A Division league rugby tournament match played at Havelock Park yesterday. Pathana led 21-8 at half time.
The match got off to a rousing start with both teams battling it out for supremacy. Isipathana drew first blood in the 13th minute of play when off a turn over ball they worked their line where centre cum vice-captain Sumudu Rankothge gave a timely off load to dashing winger Chamod Fernando who side stepped his way beautifully and went over for a superb try near the left corner flag. Full back Gayan Wickramaratne made a fabulous touchline conversion for Pathana to go into a 7-nil lead.
In the 22nd minute off a scrum Isipathana scrum half Bandara set his line in motion where Rankothge foxed the Science defence and gave a off load once more to his number eight Wageesha Weerasinghe who made the overlap and darted down for a brilliant try under the post. Wickramaratne made the conversion to extend their lead to 14-nil.
Pathana further increased their tally in the 25th minute when off a sweeping three quarter move Bandara came like a flash, collected the ball from flanker Devin Gunaratne and scampered through for a sensational under the post try side stepping the entire Science defence. Wickramaratne made the conversion and Isipathana further extended their lead to a hefty 21-nil.
In the 28th minute Science cut down the lead with a 30 metre penalty put over by fly half Hansaja.
On the stroke of half time Science scored again when off a three quarter move the ball changed hands from Supun Dilshan to speedy winger Thanuja Maduranga who sprinted his way over for a superb try. Hansaja missed the conversion and the score read 21-8 at half time.
After resumption in the 42nd minute Science scored once again when off a Pathana three quarter move Science winger Thanuja intercepted the ball and scampered through nearly 60 metres to score a try under the post. Hansaja put over the conversion to reduce the margin to 21-15.
In the 48th minute Isipathanas hero of the day and wing three quarter Chamod Fernando collected a loose ball through an aimless kick made by Science full back Dilshan and went through side stepping the defence to score near the left corner flag. Wickramaratne missed the difficult corner flag conversion and Isipathana led 26-15.
Science cut down the lead immediately when in the 61st minute fly half Hansaja fired across a neat 30 metre penalty to take the score to 26-18.
In the 70th minute, off a ruck Science prop forward Silva crashed through for a try. Hansaja missed the conversion and the score read 26-23 in Isipathanas favour.
Isipathana who had a sensational game virtually sealed it when in the 79th minute Wickramaratne put over a spectacular 35 metre corner flag penalty to take the final score to 29-23 in the end.
Soon after the final whistle, an angry section of the crowd set upon referee Roshan Fernando, who was with great difficulty taken into the club house for safety with the assistant of a large number of club security personnel.

Bradby fiesta way ahead of the rest - rugby legend Gregan
Rugby legend George Gregan who is in Sri Lanka on a two-day tour as HSBCs rugby ambassador said that he had never seen anything like the Bradby Fiesta although he had witnessed higher rugby entertainment shows during his career.
In my life I have seen many high rugby entertainment shows and the best was in South Africa as they are rugby crazy people, but I have never ever seen something in the high caliber of the Bradby Fiesta, said Gregan at a media conference held at the HSBC head office yesterday.
This is frankly marvelous and Im really impressed about it because for me it stands way ahead of the rest.
HSBC Sri Lanka partnered by the Sri Lanka Rugby and Football Union (SLRFU) and the Schools Rugby Union will hold a Coaching Master class for all Captains and Scrum Halves of A Division rugby schools in the country at the CR&FC grounds during his stay.
I will mentor them and engage in coaching activities both as a former skipper and scrum half, said Gregan. I am amazed at the talent and the enthusiasm Ive seen when it comes to rugby in Sri Lanka.
Gregan will also be involved with the HSBC Rugby Zone that will kick start at 10.00 am at the Bloomfield grounds today allowing rugby fans of all ages to come and get to enjoy a once in a lifetime experience to meet and interact with him on site as well as receive autographed rugby memorabilia. They can also capture special moments with Gregan at an exclusive photo booth, to make it a memorable and unforgettable experience.
Gregan is Australias highest internationally capped player  his illustrious rugby career spanning for over 20 years. He was the 64th player inducted to the World Rugby Hall of Fame in 2013.
Chief Operating Officer of HSBC Sri Lanka and Maldives Sriyan Cooray said, As an international bank that has been associated with rugby through several sponsorships both globally and locally, we wanted to bring an international flavour of the sport to local audiences. We are happy to be able to leverage the partnership HSBC Bank Australia has with Qantas. We feel this is a good opportunity to give our commitment and support towards rugby in Sri Lanka to give rugby fans and emerging players a chance to interact with a celebrity player.
SLRFU secretary Nazeem Mohamed said, We are delighted to have George in Sri Lanka. It is fantastic for the game and especially for the future stars of Sri Lanka rugby who will meet him. We are thankful that HSBC has taken this great initiative to help and promote the sport in the country. - (WAI)

Du Plessis out of IPL with broken finger
NEW DELHI, THURSDAY: South African batsman Faf du Plessis was Thursday ruled out of the Indian Premier League with a broken finger, raising concerns about his availability for the upcoming tour of the West Indies.
Du Plessis was the second-highest run-getter for his IPL side Rising Pune Supergiants before getting injured in his sixth game of the season on Tuesday.
And so my ipl tournament unfortunately comes to an end. Broken finger and out for 6 weeks. Thanks India and @RPSupergiants. It's been fun, the Proteas Twenty20 skipper wrote on his twitter handle. If Du Plessis takes six weeks to recover from his injury then he might miss the start of the West Indies tri-series starting June 3, which also involves Australia. Incidentally it is Australian batsman Usman Khawaja who has been named as his replacement in the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side. AFP
