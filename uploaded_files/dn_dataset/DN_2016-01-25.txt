Snowzilla blizzard pummels US
US: A massive blizzard that claimed 20 lives in the eastern United States finally appeared to be winding down Sunday, giving snowbound residents the chance to begin digging out.
The near-record snowstorm clobbered the eastern United States Friday and Saturday, shutting down New York and Washington and affecting some 85 million residents.
More than 4,400 flights were canceled, airports in New York, Philadelphia, Washington and Baltimore ground to a halt, the US capital shut down transport and Americas most populous city banned travel.
The 16 fatalities occurred in Arkansas, Kentucky, New York, North Carolina, Maryland and Virginia, while more than 200,000 people were left without power and 2,200 National Guard personnel were drafted in.
Forecasters said the storm -- dubbed Snowzilla -- dumped 22.2 inches (56 centimeters) in Washington. The 25.1 inches of snow that fell in New Yorks Central Park, was the third highest accumulation since records began in 1869.
With the storm tapering off overnight, officials in New York planned to lift a travel ban at 7:00 am Sunday (1200 GMT) -- restoring access to roads throughout the city, and in Long Island and New Jersey. You never like to disrupt transportation and commerce. However, the storm was fast and furious, said New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo. This is a storm that is nothing to be trifled with.
Strong winds raised concerns of flooding for much of the east coast, the National Weather Service warned, with streets in some New Jersey coastal towns filled with water and ice.
In New York, bus services were suspended and overland commuter and subway trains were shut as Broadway canceled performances, museums closed, shops shuttered and the regions pro sports teams rescheduled matches.
Metro and bus networks were shut down in Washington for the entire weekend, and largely shut in Philadelphia and New Jersey. Thousands of motorists were stranded for hours on highways further south.
The vast majority of flights were canceled across much of the region, but authorities said they were working around the clock to restore operations Sunday, with the first arrivals and departures expected at midday in New York.
Plows struggled to clear streets, where parked cars were buried under the snow and visibility worsened Saturday as night fell and howling winds created massive snowdrifts. Reagan National and Dulles International airports in the US capital were expected to remain closed through Sunday. Officials said the storm, which forecasters predicted would end by early Sunday in the Washington area, could cause more than $1 billion in damage. Amid the hardship there was a moment of levity provided by Tian Tian, the baby panda at the National Zoo in Washington. Footage of the panda rolling in the snow quickly went viral.
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican presidential contender, left the campaign trail to oversee the emergency response in his snowbound state, where he said there were 90,000 power outages. For folks who lose power, please, given how cold the weather is, try to go and shelter in the home of a friend or family member if you can. Dont stay in the cold, he told a news conference.
Nearly 120,000 power outages were reported in North Carolina, emergency officials said.
In Washington the national monuments, Capitol building and Smithsonian museum were all closed.
Even a massive snowball fight in Washingtons Dupont Circle, which 3,000 people said on Facebook they would attend, was postponed until Sunday due to the storms ferocity.
We just came back from some holidays in India so the weather is a difficult adjustment, said Justin Wilcox, 32, out taking selfies in the capital.
Snow and sleet also hit the southern states of Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, West Virginia and Virginia -- unusual for the region.

## Title: Australia developing auto Facebook scanner to fight online jihadis

Australia developing auto Facebook scanner to fight online jihadis
AUSTRALIA: A computer program that automatically detects signs of radicalisation on Facebook profiles is one of several tools being developed by Australian experts to counter the spread of jihadi rhetoric online.
However, a tool kit developed for the federal Attorney General's department to help law enforcement and other services identify online radicalisation has not been adopted by the government more than six months after its creation.
Fairfax Media revealed on Thursday that banned British preacher Abu Haleema has turned his gaze to Australia and is quickly building a support base among young jihadi sympathisers in Australia.
Authorities are powerless to stop him and other influential overseas radicals from preaching hate through Facebook, YouTube and other social media.
About one report a day is being made to the government's Report Online Extremism Tool, according to data provided to Fairfax Media.
Among Haleema's supporters are several Sydney men who have flooded their Facebook pages with messages attacking non-religious law in Australia.
"Going to seek judgement from taghoot (man made law) makes you a kaffir [non-believer]," said one fan, a former Parramatta High School student.
Anne Azza Aly, one of the country's leading researchers in online extremism, said there are almost always "warning behaviours" online before an individual carried out an act of violent extremism.
"A large proportion of people will leak their intentions online," she said.
A report, commissioned by the Attorney General's Department, determined the risk factors for online radicalisation and formulated a matrix-based tool kit for law enforcement and other services to identity the warning signs.
The Curtin University research, completed in July, also developed the first-ever metric for evaluating counter-narratives however none of the tools have been adopted, Dr Aly said. A spokesman for the Attorney General's department said the findings had been incorporated into other online strategies.
Together with a British company, Dr Aly is working towards automating the tool kit so it can scan Facebook profiles and pick up markers of extremism.
"It would flag a certain user's behaviour online, then we can go in and look more deeply at that user," she said.
She said relying on social media companies to pull down pages such as Haleema's was "a whack-a-mole approach that is not an effective long-term strategy". The British extremist has boasted about setting up new profiles up to three times in a day.
The country's first Children's e-Safety Commissioner, Alastair MacGibbon, is also scoping programs to build digital resilience to violent extremism.
He said the internet has been "a great boon" for radicals and other predators."We're putting an ever-increasing amount of well-targeted information online for families and kids. This is an issue of good digital citizenship."

Fish at risk of being drunk on carbon
AUSTRALIA: Ocean fish around the world risk becoming lost at sea if carbon dioxide concentrations in seawater continue to rise on current trajectories, a study from the University of NSW has found.
The study, published in the journal Nature, is the first global analysis of the impact of rising carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels on natural variations in carbon dioxide concentrations in the worlds oceans.
It found that carbon dioxide concentrations could reach levels high enough to disorient and intoxicate fish, a condition known as hypercapnia.
Essentially, the fish become lost at sea, said the study reports lead author, Ben McNeil, of UNSW.
The carbon dioxide affects their brains and they lose their sense of direction and ability to find their way home. They dont even know where their predators are.
Hypercapnia research in fish is relatively new, starting about 6 years ago.
In the case of ocean fish, high levels of carbon dioxide affect receptors for GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate brain. The study suggested the resulting physiological and behavioural impacts could have extensive implications for population replenishment, community structure, ecosystem function and, in turn, the worlds fisheries.
In terms of the problem for fisheries, youve got juvenile fish who cant recognise where their home is or sense where predators are. So obviously they are very prone to being eaten or lost, Dr McNeil said.
It is still really unknown how this will manifest in the future ... but its a bit of a wake-up call for commercial fisheries [who will] have to manage this, because it is going to be likely quite a big problem.
Dr McNeil said the effect only occurs as humans increase carbon dioxide output, meaning the only way to mitigate is to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
The study found a substantial amplification of the annual oceanic carbon dioxide cycle over the 21st century, recording a five- to eight-fold amplification in regions within the Southern, Pacific and North Atlantic oceans.
While the study only looked at open ocean areas, Dr McNeil said the likely hotspots in Australia would be in southern regions, south of Tasmania and along the Antarctic.
For this work the team has developed an algorithm to predict future carbon dioxide levels and have launched a challenge for others to help in the next phase of the research.
We are challenging other scientists with innovative predictive approaches to download the data set we used ... to see if they can beat our approach, Dr McNeil said.
ARC Centre for Excellence in Coral Reef Studies biologist Professor Phillip Munday said the study had sparked a lot of interest among the scientific community, but he was uncomfortable with the description of fish as intoxicated.
I do not agree with the term from a scientific perspective. Intoxication is a term related to the effects of alcohol, which is not what this is. He said a more apt description of what fish experience with elevated levels of carbon dioxide is behavioural impairment.
What this paper really tells us is that the levels of carbon dioxide in open oceans are going to be higher and last longer than we may have expected, therefore we need to get a good handle on how these rising levels could affect open ocean species.
The UNSW scientists utilised a global database of seawater carbon dioxide concentrations from the past 30 years, allowing them to predict that by 2100, creatures in up to half the worlds surface oceans could be affected by hypercapnia.
The findings come just days after an Ellen MacArthur Foundation report found the worlds oceans are expected to contain more plastics than fish (by weight) by 2050.
The New Plastics Economy report outlined an alternative approach to reducing the flow of plastics into natural ecosystems and dissociating plastics from fossil feed stocks.

Giant killers Army down Tamil Union to win Premier T20 title
The presence of seven national caps in the Tamil Union line-up did not deter giant-killers Army SC who beat them rather comprehensively by five wickets with three overs to spare to lift the AIA Premier T20 title for the first time at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Army SC's win in the final was no fluke for the day before they had downed another top club SSC in the semi-final also by five wickets.
Match winners for the Army: Asela Gunaratne (65 n.o.) and Sampath Perera (4/24).
Invited to bat first Tamil Union managed a total of 164/9 thanks largely to a fine knock of 85 off 57 balls from Tillakaratne Dilshan. The Lankan opener hit 13 fours in his innings to follow his 95 not out in the semi-final against NCC the previous day. However apart from his contribution there was no other noteworthy performance from the rest of the batters. At one stage Tamil Union were 87-7 in the 12th over before Dilshan who had been playing a lone hand at one end found a partner Manoj Sarathchandra (20) and these two raised the total to a decent 146 before Dilshan was dismissed in the 19th over.
The bowler who caused most trouble for the Tamil Union batsmen was leg-spinner Sampath Perera who spun out four top order batsmen for 24 runs including the wicket of Dilshan.
Perera was assisted greatly by Sri Lanka spinner Ajanth Mendis who picked up two wickets for 39.
The Army's run chase was led by Asela Gunaratne who hit an unbeaten 65 off 43 balls with two sixes and seven fours. He shared in partnerships of 53 with Pathum Dilshan (21) and 47 off 19 balls with Sri Lanka spinner and captain Seekkuge Prasanna who slammed four sixes in his cameo knock of 28 off 10 balls to seal the match in Army's favour.
Scores:
Tamil Union 164/9 in 20 overs (Tillakaratne Dilshan 85, Pulina Tharanga 20 n.o., Sanjika Ridma 2/31, Ajantha Mendis 2/39, Sampath Perera 4/24)
Sri Lanka Army 170/5 in 17 overs (Pathum Dilshan 21, Asela Gunaratne 65 n.o., Shalika Karunanayake 27, Seekkuge Prasanna 28, Shaminda Eranga 2/19)

JVP poser on Indo-Lanka Economic Agreement
The government has no clear mandate from the people to sign the Indo-Lanka Economic Agreement, JVP national organiser, MP Bimal Ratnayake said. He said they have received information that the government was continuing with its process of signing the Indo-Lanka Economic Agreement which was subjected to various discussions among employers, industrialists, businessmen and trade unions for about 10 years.
Ratnayake said even former Presidents Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa couldnt sign this agreement though they were keen on signing the agreement because they couldnt prove the advantage of signing the agreement.
But it is questionable who requested the Maithri-Ranil government to sign this and whether the government has the peoples mandate to do that, he said.
According to a letter sent by International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama in reply to a question raised by the JVP in Parliament, a draft of the proposed agreement has already been presented to an Indian delegation, he said.
Ratnayake also said that by submitting this without informing the people of this country, the government has shown its servile manner.
It is also questionable as to whom Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is responsible to, the Parliament or to the Indian Prime Minister Modi.
He said the JVP does not think that Sri Lankan should be isolated.
Agreements should be signed with other countries. But before signing this type of agreements with India, the government should consider about the unemployment rate of India, Ratnayake said.
We do not want to sign agreements by destroying the economic sovereignty of the country, he added.

Police SC maintains recently found form
Police Sports Club beat CH and FC by 29 points to 17 in their Dialog League inter-club rugby match played at Police Park yesterday.
The law-enforcing team, who led 10-7 at lemons, collected their points from two goals and three tries while CH scored two goals and a penalty. The Maitland Crescent club team put up an improved performance in the return leg, compared to the 0-62 thrashing they suffered against the same team in the first round.
The first half was evenly contested with Police taking only a close three-point lead at the short whistle. But Police cut loose in the second half to add 19 more points. The winners scored five tries and two of them were converted by Riza Raseideen.
Joining the Police try feast were Chula Susantha, Joel Perera, Udara Chanaka, Mohammed Sheriff and Sudam Suriarachchi. The two CH tries were scored by Gemunu Hettinayake and Mohammed Rizwan. Janith Chandimal converted one of those tries while Sajith Bandara put over a penalty.
Thus, the high-riding Police SC maintained their superb form in recent matches, following their exciting wins over Army SC (47-45) and much fancied Navy SC (16-11) in successive weekends. Sheriff has played a significant role towards Police SC's recent success with some dynamic moves, irrespective of the position he plays.
He scored a try in yesterday's encounter as well while their forwards combined effectively with the back division to edge out CH.
