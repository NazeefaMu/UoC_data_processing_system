Injury hit Lanka pick inexperienced fast bowling line-up : Chandimal ruled out of Zimbabwe Tests
Sri Lanka will send to Zimbabwe one of their most inexperienced Test fast bowling line-ups when the 15-member squad was announced by Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday.
To add to their woes vice-captain, top batter and wicket-keeper Dinesh Chandimal wont be making the tour to Zimbabwe as he has still not fully recovered from a thumb injury which he sustained playing in a Mercantile A division match last month. The injury required surgery.
Chandimals place is filled by the Sri Lanka Army SCs uncapped 30-year-old right-hand batting all-rounder Asela Gunaratne who has been amongst the runs in the ongoing unofficial test series against West Indies A.
Chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya stated that he was hopeful that Chandimal would recover in time for the one-day tri-series against Zimbabwe and West Indies that starts at Harare on November 14.
The two Tests against Zimbabwe are scheduled to be played at Harare from October 29-November 2 and November 6-10.
The delay in releasing the squad which was picked over a week ago was due to the fitness concerns surrounding key players especially the fast bowlers..
Eventually the Lankan selectors were left with only Suranga Lakmal as the fast bowler who was fit for selection amongst the experienced lot.
How weak the Lankan pace bowling line-up is can be gauged by the fact that Lakmal although being the most experienced of the five fast bowlers picked for the tour has never produced a five-wicket innings haul in Tests in the six years he has played for his country. In 29 Tests he has 60 wickets at an average which is usually associated with a batsman  49.40. The selectors have no option but to pick him as the spearhead of the fast bowling attack.
We have picked the best possible line-up of fast bowlers available to us, said chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya.
Kasun Madushanka has been bowling well in the ongoing series against West Indies A and Lahiru Gamage is the most experienced Sri Lanka A bowler we have. We picked Lahiru Kumara (Sri Lanka under 19 bowler) because he is good potential for the future, he said.
All three fast bowlers are uncapped along with Gunaratne. Adding to the woes of the long list of fast bowling injuries are two young fast bowlers Asitha Fernando (hamstring) and Vishwa Fernando (back injury).
Sri Lanka are already beset by injuries to key fast bowlers Dhammika Prasad (shoulder), Nuwan Pradeep (hamstring), Dushmantha Chameera (back stress fracture) and one-day specialist Lasith Malinga (knee). They have also lost the services of Shaminda Eranga reported for a suspect bowling action.
In the absence of Chandimal, Jayasuriya said that Niroshan Dickwella who has been picked in the squad would most probably be taking over the wicket-keeping gloves although there is also Kusal Perera who has kept wickets for Sri Lanka in Tests.
Dimuth Karunaratne and Kaushal Silva are the two established openers, but Perera can also play the dual-purpose role of opener or late order batsman. The Lankan batting seems settled with the exception of Chandimal whose absence will put extra pressure on the rest of the batters to perform.
The spin department is once again headed by the experienced and most capped current Sri Lanka Test player left-armer Rangana Herath who will be supported by off-spinner Dilruwan Perera and left-arm chinaman Lakshan Sandakan.

Vandersay spins Sri Lanka A to series win
Promising right-arm leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay roared back into form after injury with a match-winning bowling performance taking six wickets for 47 runs off 21.2 overs to bowl Sri Lanka A to a series clinching 138 runs win over West Indies A on the fourth and final day of the third and
final unofficial test played at Rangiri Dambulla Stadium yesterday.
The win gave Sri Lanka A the three-match series 2-1.
West Indies A set a target of 333 to chase were bundled out for 194 after Sri Lanka A had declared their second innings at 257-6 at the fall of Roshen Silvas wicket 44. Dasun Shanaka remained unbeaten on 33.
West Indies A began their run chase well with an opening stand of 63 and one stage were 171-4 before Vandersay took control of the game with a six-wicket haul that saw the last six wickets crash for 23 runs.
Vandersay had been laid low by a broken finger sustained at practice in May and returned to competitive cricket in the second unofficial test of the current series.
It was the spinners who did the damage to the West Indies A innings with Lakshan Sandakan picked for the tour of Zimbabwe returning figures of 3 for 61 to follow his three wickets in the first innings and Sri Lanka under 19 captain Charith Asalanka picking up the wicket of first innings top scorer Shimron Hetmyer for 18. Kieran Powell (44) and skipper Shamarh Brooks (46) were the only batsmen to offer any resistance as the Lankan spinners swept the rest of the batting to achieve victory in the first mandatory over. The two teams will now clash in a three-match unofficial one-day series starting on October 24 at Dambulla.

Honours even as Tamim leads Bangladesh fight-back
CHITTAGONG, Friday: Tamim Iqbal scored a half-century as Bangladesh made a solid start Friday in response to Englands first innings in an evenly-poised opening Test before skipper Mushfiqur Rahim was bowled just before the close.
England paceman Ben Stokes dismissed Rahim for 48, three overs before stumps in Chittagong. The hosts finished the day on 221-5, trailing Englands first innings total of 293 runs by 72.
Shakib Al Hasan, who shared a 58-run partnership with Rahim for the fifth wicket, remained unbeaten on 31 overnight along with nightwatchman Shafiul Islam, who has yet to get off the mark.
Tamim earlier top-scored with 78 for the home side, his 19th half-century and fifth against England, before he got a top edge when he attempted to cut off-spinner Gareth Batty.
Tamim, who hit seven fours, added 90 runs with Mahmudullah (38) for the third wicket to steady Bangladeshs innings after Moeen Ali took two wickets in one over before the lunch break to rattle them.
Tamim got a reprieve at 55 through a television review after being given out just before the tea break.
Adil Rashid, who earlier dropped a tough catch of Tamim at 28 off Moeen, broke the left-handers partnership when he had Mahmudullah caught at slip by Joe Root. The hosts had been 29-2 at lunch after Moeen -- who scored a half-century in Englands innings -- bowled opener Imrul Kayes for 21 off his very first ball and then had Mominul Haque caught by Stokes at slip for a duck.
Earlier, 18-year-old debutant off-spinner Mehedi Hasan claimed the final wicket of Stuart Broad to finish with 6-80 as England added just 35 runs to their overnight 258-7 before they were all out. Left-arm Taijul Islam took the other two wickets that fell in the morning
in Englands innings to return with the figures of 2-47. Taijul dismissed overnight batsman Chris Woakes (36) off the first ball of the day as Mominul took the catch at forward short leg.
Adil Rashid was given out leg-before off Mehedi in the next over but the decision was overturned after a review as replays indicated the ball had been missing leg stump. Rashid made good use of his fortune to score a brisk 26 before a fine diving catch at cover by Sabbir Rahman off Taijul ended his innings. AFP
