Reconciliation will be included in school curriculum: Chandrika
Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) Chairperson former President Chandrika Kumaratunga said her office was working with the Education Ministry to include reconciliation as a special subject in the school curriculum.
She said it aims to further strengthen efforts already being taken towards national unity and reconciliation.
Students at the event
The former President was speaking at an event to mark the National Integration and Reconciliation Week at Ananda College, Colombo last Tuesday. The event was a part of a series of programmes titled National Unity and Reconciliation organised by the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry at schools island wide.
The former President said, Education is not merely about learning subjects such as languages, religions and sciences. We should take a holistic approach to education. The children should also learn about the society in general.
They should learn about the prevailing social issues, the solutions to overcome such issues and about what we should do. They should study these things in-depth. Now we are discussing with the Education Ministry to include a special subject in the school curriculum for National Reconciliation and Unity. During my term, I introduced Peace Education as one of the subjects. But the next government discontinued it. We are, therefore, going to make it a subject that students should study and also face at examinations.
Kumaratunga said that during recent discussions she had with relevant stakeholders, it had come to light that although a majority of Sinhala and Tamil students like to learn languages of others, lack of qualified teachers remains a major obstacle in this regard.
The students and teachers who attended the programme gave a pledge to protect national unity and reconciliation. The former President advised that this should not confine to mere words. "Everybody should commit to protect the pledge they gave whenever it is needed," she said.
National Integration and Reconciliation State Minister A.H.M. Fowzie said Sinhala Buddhists are not inclined towards racism. "As a politician when I contested for Colombo district at elections, 23 Sinhala Buddhist candidates contested alongside me. There were many strong candidates among these 23. But the Sinhala Buddhists voted and made me the first in the district because I am not a racist," he said
He said certain groups attempt to topple the government now by provoking racism and religious animosities. The country cannot be developed in this way, he said. Ananda college has done a lot over the years to propagate national unity and reconciliation. Schools can be the cradle to promote lasting national unity and reconciliation in our country.
This is why we have started a programme like this covering schools island wide, he said.
National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy said the country has people belonging to different religions, ethnic backgrounds and cultures, and all should strive to live under one identity as Sri Lankans while respecting diversity of each.
He said national unity and reconciliation was of utmost importance to propagate socioeconomic development and prosperity. He urged students to act as envoys to take the message of peace to all sections of society.
National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry State Secretary, President's Counsel M.M. Zuhair said an overwhelming majority of Sri Lankans do not approve racism or religious discrimination, but a small minority are trying to divide the country by inciting racism and religious discrimination.
We should defeat their attempts. If we are to develop this country, it is of utmost importance that we sustain national unity and reconciliation. We all should shed our petty differences and unite as one to achieve this goal, he said.
Hagunketa Chandrajyoti Thera, made an anusasana at the event, Principal S.M. Keerthiratne, ONUR Director General M.S. Jayasinghe, National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Additional Secretary H.M.S. Jayatunge also spoke.

8 Easy Tips for the Perfect Lawn
A soft, green lawn is a wonderful thing, and it doesn't have to be out of reach. Here's some simple advice for establishing terrific turf.
Prevent Weeds Before They Come Up
Lawn Spreader.
Stop weeds from gaining a roothold in your lawn before they even germinate by using a pre-emergent herbicide. This type of product controls the dreaded crabgrass, as well as other hard-to-eliminate weeds, by stopping their seeds from sprouting in your lawn.
Use a pre-emergent early in the spring.
Shop for Crabgrass Control
Caution
When using lawn treatments or lawn care products, always follow package directions regarding proper clothing, protective equipment, application procedures and safety precautions.
Eliminate Broadleaf Weeds Once They've Sprouted
Dandelions in a Lawn.
Broadleaf weeds are the big weeds that are immediately obvious in your lawn: the bright-yellow faces of dandelions (and their scatter-in-the-wind seeds), white-flowering clover and big-leaf plantain are all pretty visible. To treat, apply granular weed control products. If there are just a few offenders, you can remove them by hand.
Good to Know
Wait until there is heavy morning dew to apply granular weed control products. The granules need moisture to stick to weed leaves, and a dewy morning provides that for you.
Mow High and Frequently
Mowing your lawn too short may seem like a time saver, but this can damage your grass as well as allow weeds to set root. Keeping your lawn a bit taller results in healthier grass. The general rule of thumb is: Never cut off more than a third of the grass blade.
Keep Your Mower Blade Sharp
A dull blade tears the grass, resulting in a ragged edge that makes the overall lawn look grayish brown. Sharpen or replace the mower blade when it shows signs of wear  or at least once a mowing season.
Good to Know
The size of your lawn and the frequency of mowing will dictate how often you should sharpen or replace your blade. Take a look at a grass blade after mowing. If it's shredded or frayed, it's time to sharpen up.
Water in the Morning
The best time to water your lawn is the early morning because the sun will help dry the grass. Nighttime watering can result in prolonged moisture on the blades, which can open the door for some diseases. It's better to water less often but for prolonged periods. Just wetting down the grass isn't watering the grass. You need to soak the lawn so the soil moisture goes down several inches.
Good to Know
Are you watering enough Try the soup can test. Set an empty can next to your lawn sprinkler. When there is about a 1/2 inch of water in the can, it's time to turn off the sprinkler.
Feed Your Lawn
Using a Lawn Spreader.
What do lawns like to consume Nitrogen is the most important nutrient. Look for a mix of fast- and slow-release fertilizers that will green up your lawn quickly, and feed it over time. In the north, feed in fall and spring. In the south, feed in spring and summer. Don't feed dormant grass (drought can cause grass to go dormant in summer) because it can't take in nutrients.
Caution
More is not better. If you put too much nitrogen on your lawn, you'll burn it. Read the label and follow the application directions.
Spot-Train Your Dog
Dog on a Lawn.
If you have a dog that spends any time in your yard, your lawn will show it. Large yellow and dead spots in your lawn will be giveaways. The nitrogen in dog urine is the culprit. Encourage your dog to use just one spot in the yard. Make a gravel or mulch area where your dog can do his business without spotting the lawn. Yard-train your dog in the same way you house-trained him. Walk him out to the area you want him to use and use treats to reward good behavior.
Reseed Sparse Lawns
If your lawn is a little thin in areas, you can seed over the area to help lush it up. Fall is the ideal time to reseed cool-season grasses. Plant warm-season grasses in late spring.
Shop Grass Seed
Caution
Make sure you don't apply a pre-emergent preventer at the same time you plant seed; it will stop your grass seedlings from growing. -.lowes.com

An accommodation with the realities
The European and the African have an entirely different concept of time.
We climb into the bus and sit down. At this point there is a risk of culture clash, of collision and conflict. It will undoubtedly occur if the passenger is a foreigner who doesnt know Africa. Someone like that will start looking around, squirming, inquiring, when will the bus leave
What do you mean, when the astonished driver will reply. The bus will leave when we find enough people to fill it up
The African who boards a bus sits down in a vacant seat, and immediately falls into a state in which he spends a great portion of his life: a benumbed waiting.
These people have a fantastic talent for waiting! an Englishman who has lived here for years tells me. A talent, stamina, some peculiar kind of instinct.
A waiting group is mute. It emits no sound. The body goes limp, droops, shrinks. The person does not look around, does not observe anything, is not curious. Sometimes his eyes are closed-but not always. More frequently, they are open but appear unseeing, with no spark of life in them.
What, in the meantime, is going on inside their heads
I do not know. Are they thinking Dreaming Reminiscing Making plans Meditating Traveling in the world beyond
It is difficult to say.
(The Shadow of the Sun - Ryszard Kapuscinski)
The only alternative to a Mahinda Rajapaksa (MR) regime is the Maithripala Sirisena/Ranil Wickremesinghe (MS/RW) government, while, the only credible challenge to the MS/RW combine is a MR regime, is how one of our more perceptive commentators described the current political configuration in the country.
It is difficult to think of a more hopeless and plaintive theme for a country, especially, as these are persons whose claim to lead is based on public mandate; democratically chosen by the people (however imperfect that process maybe) to lead their political parties, espouse public causes and finally manage the country itself. If the alternatives are as limited, if these are the only available leadership material the country is possessed of, we are indeed much poorer than statistically shown.
The material causes of poverty could be addressed and even successfully overcome. There are a few countries which have, Singapore being a particular example of a country which within our lifetime has gone from a poverty stricken status to becoming one of the richest in the world. In retrospect, it seems that Singapore carried from the beginning the potential both in spirit and skill to achieve what they did.
It is perhaps somewhat facile to say that one man, Lee Kuan Yew, was solely responsible for the miracle; such accomplishments are beyond the abilities of one person, however capable. For the dream to become reality, the mans drive, vision and talent must be answered by the nation. There could not be a Marx in Saudi Arabia, a Gandhi in Germany or a Beethoven in Nigeria. For a person (or an achievement) of a global impact to blossom, the soil must be fertile.
The countries that produced these extraordinary personalities had the necessary background for that particular genius to emerge. For certain, each country will have its own writers, thinkers and musicians; circumscribed by that particular environment, and of relevance only to that particular culture.
Promising countries in Asia
It is only given to a few to produce persons and ideas of universal relevance. Anybody can play Cricket, but only a very few can invent a sport that can be enjoyed by many cultures, worldwide. What Singapore has become today is an inspiration to the entire world; it has shown a way forward. Place Lee Kuan Yew in another culture, and perhaps the results would not have been that spectacular.
Little Singapore is an example of a country overcoming material disadvantages within a short period of time. But material handicaps are not the only drawbacks in a nations path. There could be other, less tangible snags bedeviling it; a lot more complex and elusive in substance than mere material poverty. For such manifestations we can refer to the hopelessness of our countrys situation and its damnable political arrangement. Relatively, Sri Lanka is not a resource poor country. In 1948, at the time of independence, it was said by many that, Ceylon, as it was referred to then, was one of the more promising countries in Asia.
We had a well-developed plantation sector, reasonably advanced infrastructure-including an extensive road network, nascent industries which could have been developed, a healthy balance of payment situation, somewhat strong institutions and a population which had been exposed to democratic methods for longer than many other countries in Asia. But in a few years all that just went away, reducing us to a mediocre country, lurching from one crisis to another.
Almost all our problems are results of post- independence political actions, or old problems exacerbated since. Nearly every government, claiming wizardry in that difficult art, attempts at constitution making; but invariably acts with the very antithesis of good law making; devious, self-serving and short term interests. Whoever is in ascendency at the time ends up conferring on himself more powers than he had prior to the constitution he makes! The result of all this mindless tinkering is now before us. We have a constitution which everybody wants out, but nobody can remove potentially undemocratic, dangerous and open to abuse.
From time immemorial there have been several races living in this country. Their relations have been mostly peaceful with the occasional conflict, like in all histories. In 1948, we had a chance at a new beginning, an opportunity to forge a national identity, emphasize the common factors, becoming one. Our political leadership was far below the required calibre for the task; leaving for the future generations to deal with embittered racial relations and a destructive three decades long civil war (like many things in this country, a long stalemate, neither party capable of achieving their ends nor bringing it to a speedy conclusion)
In the all-important area of economic management, the showy and ponderous efforts of our politicians take the air of a tragi-comedy.
Those who have a memory of the ideology driven regime of 1970-77 will recall how the then government waged war on every grower and producer; leaving the country poor, fallow and broken. Things have improved much since. But in comparison with countries we were on par with in the early years, we still lag far behind. Politicians, egos running on top gear, revel in prestige projects (generally named after them), -Mihin Air, Bandaranayake Hall, Senanayake Samudraya (ocean!), Rajapaksa Airport (in the middle of nowhere) keep sprouting. Most of the misdeeds of the politicians are committed through our uneconomical and unproductive public sector; employing on a conservative estimate, at least five fold the number required for their functions.
Political culture
By far the biggest employer, the public sector is an open field for the politicians; to exploit, misuse and abuse in any way they fancy. Sadly, more the politicians change in this country, more they remain the same; we now have national budgets of which nearly every proposal is given the short-shrift within days, smacking of rank amateurism and superficiality in budget planning. No one seems to know what became of the much spoken of mansion tax, a tax on an asset.
A very notable feature of our political culture is the longevity of political careers. Several of the present leaders began their politics in the 1970s or even before, in their callow youth, on the basis that their fathers too were in politics! What in most cultures would be a matter of embarrassment is considered a qualification here. Later in the career, this absurdity becomes an asset, when it will be argued that in the interim the man has become a sage like figure- experienced, wise and philosophical! Presumably, he knew the answers to our problems in the 1970s, and knows the answers to our present and future problems too.
This phenomenon can only be understood as a feature of the underlying Brahmanism of the culture, punditry as a reserve of a few, thwarting and paralyzing everything it touches. There is no periodic renewing or refreshing of political ideas or talent here. Only those who burn incense at the altar of the leader may aspire to a career in public service. It is not for us to see the fresh political faces of the Obamas, Theresa Mays or even Donald Trumps. As to new ideas, we wait in vain.
In the past two thousand years; ideas, methods and technology of Europe has changed in a revolutionary way, and that is putting it mildly. From primitive beginnings they have evolved into prosperous democracies while at the same time making huge strides in science and technology. So great has been the transformation that in the process mans view of his role in the universe itself has changed; no longer is he a mere vassal of a feudal lord or a helpless victim of dark supernatural forces. Today, he will only accept a social contract based on the rule of law; the governed as well as the governor, equally bound by it. Needless to say, these developed societies have also ensured a very high standard of life for their people.
On the other hand, when we look at our own history, there seems to be an unchanging quality, a stoical temperament, an inability to break free; with no discernible change between the methods of governing between our first King Vijaya and the last, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, two thousand years later.
Empowering of the people
In between these two kings, there have been several rulers said to have been benevolent, but that is mainly on account of the personality of the king rather than a change of system or the empowering of the people.
Technology wise, the latter stages of the kingdom appear a low point, kings of centuries before being credited with better technology and much bigger achievements than the subsequent.
It is said that in a democracy it is the voter who must take the final responsibility for the leaders they elect. Going by the kind of persons they have been electing regularly, the only rational conclusion we can come to is that confusion worse confounded reigns in the ranks. Perhaps the voter thinks that the elected deserve a social uplift, the most noticeable feature of the electoral process being the rapid gentrification of the elected.
No sooner he is elected, the man becomes a sir, his wife madam, and their children baby. They will stop driving (if they were driving before); the State will provide them with vehicles and chauffeurs. In fact, then on any physical activity on his part, even stirring a cup of tea, is unbecoming of his magnificence (the only exception to the cutting down on physical activity is the constitutional at the Independence Square, Colombo 7-now in fashion)
What holds the key to the gravy train is not the election to parliament by the voter. That is bound to happen, one way or the other, once you become a candidate of a major political party. If a person is simple unelectable, he can easily become an appointed member of parliament through the Party! The crucial move is to get in to the Party, preferably as the leader.
Our political parties are democratic only in name; in substance they are very much like a private company of which the leader is the major shareholder. It is nearly impossible to remove the leader unless he in some way sells his shares. The Party in reality is a gathering of deplorables; careerists, adventurers, hustlers and hangers on around a strong man who in their calculations can manoeuvre them into power on a future date and bring the machinery of the State into their grubby hands.
That in fact there is no real difference between our political parties is clearly borne out from the regular cross-overs from one party to another. It is very common to see national organisers, secretaries and central committee members of one Party crossing over to the opposite Party to become stalwarts overnight of that Party. In the same family we see brothers in leading positions of different Parties.
Trotskyite revolution
Philip Gunawardena, the one-time leader of the much promised Trotskyite revolution ended his political career as a Cabinet member of the UNP government of 1965-70. His brother Robert Gunawardena, another fire breathing Marxist became an ambassador under the same so called capitalist government, which he had been damning. It is said that around 1972 even JR Jayewardena, in the height of tensions with the then UNP leader Dudley Senanayake, commenced negotiations with Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike on the possibility of joining her coalition government (JR Jayewardena of Sri Lanka- KM De Silva/Wriggins)
Some of this fickleness could arise out of frustration with the leader (the major shareholder!) who, fails to deliver, yet continues to hold onto the reigns of the Party. In a mature democracy, after the magnitude of the UNP defeat of 1970, the leader (Dudley Senanayake) would have left of his own. That did not happen, and a more astute JR Jayewardena was perhaps pushed into a difficult moral dilemma. In 1977, Sirima Bandaranaike was rejected by the voter in no uncertain terms. But the SLFP which she led continued with her leadership until the mid-1990s when it came back into power with her daughter Chandrika Bandaranaike as President and Sirima Bandaranaike in the evening of her life, as Prime Minister!
The lifestyle that the elected has created for them is the basis of the unspoken conspiracy that makes all politicians bedfellows. Whatever the professed differences, our politicians will not upset the wonderful existence that they have created. Herein perhaps lies another difference between the European models (mainly British), on which almost all our institutions as well as political ideas are based.
Our leaders may study at European universities, speak their language, and don their dress but by their efforts to identify with that civilization, only show how much they misunderstand it. They have not acquired the thoughts that fashioned the institutions nor the values that inspired the ideals of the West. It is the exception, the aberration; the corruption of the Nixons, the excesses of the Kennedys, and the sleaze of the Clintons of history that comforts them by providing a commonality. What is important to our leaders is not the reaching out for something good, the endless search for an ideal or the imperatives behind mans long march from slave to free man. Theirs is an outlook infinitely smaller; to bask in the public light, hog public office and to enjoy the good life at public expense.
And meanwhile, what is going on in the heads of the voters who make all this possible - those who talk politics, are members of political parties, go for political meetings, and finally vote in the politicians
Thoughts, dreams, plans, ideals or as in all their history; just an accommodation with everyday realities
It is difficult to say.

Justice C.G. Weeramantry
Jurist and advocate ofhighest calibre
My first contact with Justice C.G. Weeramantry goes back to 1956 when doing the final year of the Advocates course at the Law College. He was our lecturer in the Law of Contracts.
Although he and I are of the same vintage having reached our 90th year almost simultaneously, he had entered Law College much earlier than me and was now enjoying a lucrative civil practice at the Colombo Bar which demands for his services coming thick and fast from the outstations.
When I started practice in early 1958, I was not personally known to Justice Weeramantry, but following the stand I took when the independence of the Bar was threatened by certain events that took place that year, he invited me to work with him.
I did so for a short time till I ventured on my own and lawyers like the calibre of Nehru Goonatilake PC and others joined him forming a formidable group in the profession.
Two incidents that arose from the close association bring happy memories today. One was when he was retained by the Kandy Omni Bus Company for a case in the District Court Kandy, I had the pleasure of his company sharing a double bed room at Queens Hotel for an overnight stay.
At about this time, one of my brothers was the international manager of Ceylon Insurance Company stationed in Singapore handpicked by Justin Kotelawala.
However, the two of them fell out and the matter came up in the then Industrial Court where Justice Weeramantry appeared for my brother with me and E.G. Wickremanayake QC appeared for Justin Kotelawala.
Justice Weeramantry was so much feared as an opposing counsel, that Wickremanayake advised Justin Kotelawala to avoid any inquiry and settle the case.
Justice Weeramantry was keenly alive to the social and political changes taking place at this time. In the tussle raging between J.R. and Dudley, he was openly and fearlessly on Dudleys side and organised meetings of lawyers at his home to evolve a strategy for Dudley to resume leadership of the UNP and stand as the Prime Ministerial candidate at the 1965 general election.
I was one of the invitees for this meeting. We had a pleasant time at the parties hosted by Justice Weeramantry and his wife, who hailed from the de Sampayo clan, at their Suleiman Avenue residence in this connection as well as when he took Silk and became a Supreme Court Judge.
Justice Weeramantry was a jurist and an advocate of the highest caliber.
He excelled in genuine research in producing his monumental work on the Law of Contacts which brought him plaudits and accolades from universities the world over.
Members of the Academia whose research is partly plagiaristic, will do well to emulate him when he developed the meanings of the concept in the law of contracts from their primeval sources giving worldwide references to case law as well.
Justice Weeramantry realised the need for a free and independent Bar as the surest guarantee for the preservation of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and judicial integrity.
In the year 1958, when the then minister of justice M.W.H.de Silva, QC, a known follower of Chairman Mao Tsetungs politics wanted to socialise the legal profession by introducing the college system as practiced in China, I with logistical support from advocate Ivon Perera of Gower Street took it upon ourselves to oppose it.
E.R.S.R.Coomarasamy PC was collecting counter signatures for a memorandum to be presented to the government. The threat to the independence of the Bar was imminent. But senior lawyers were slow to react. I prepared a memorandum and went about collecting counter signatures. The initial response was weak. For one thing, our memorandum contained only Platitudinous Statements but not a word about refuting the college system.
Justice Weeramantry not only singed our memorandum, but added a new paragraph in his own handwriting to our working paper rejecting the college system. In doing so he displayed his legal acumen and political philosophy in no small measure. His joining our movement resulted in an avalanche of support coming our way and we won the day.
Present day lawyers many not be aware of this episode in their history. When the present outgoing president of the Bar Association was asked to take official recognition of the matter because of the failure of its predecessor the General Council of Advocates to maintain records, he did not show any interest. At least for the part played by Justice Weeramantry in that controversy he should have responded positively.
Justice Weeramantry was a man apart. When compared with the general run of lawyers who have opted to take office judicial or otherwise one can only quote S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who once said in Parliament "some people adorn the office, others the office adorns."
When Justice Weeramantry decided to assume Supreme Court Office and from there proceed to Monash University as Professor of Law and finally end up as vice president of the International Court of Justice, he was lost to his colleagues but the world gained him.
May his soul rest in peace.

Sunil Rodrigo
A true friend
It is with a sense of profound loss and sadness I write this appreciation of Sunil Rodrigo my friend and guru and former chairman of Lake House who passed away peacefully with his family at his bedside.
He was born 89 years ago in Paragastota, a village close to Horana and was named Sunil by Anagarika Dharmapala, a relative of his mother. He was educated at S. Thomas' College and graduated from University College, Colombo after which he proceeded to London to study law.
At the London School of Economics, he was active in student politics and was elected president of the student union known as the Majlis. There he made friends with Krishna Menon and Paul Robeson. At the first Commonwealth Prime Minister's Conference Krishna Menon introduced Sunil to then Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake as "a young man whom you should keep an eye on."
At this time Sunil had a regular weekly broadcast in English over the BBC overseas service regarding life in post-war England. After graduating in Political Science from LSC, he was called to the Bar from the Middle Temple in England.
Soon after, Shell Company recruited him in London and returned to Ceylon to join the Colombo Office. His stint at Shell Colombo did not last long as he could not put up with the obnoxious behaviour of other British executives. Sir UkwatteJayasundera invited him to join his Chambers for whom he had acted as an unofficial tour guide of London when Sir Ukwatte visited London as part of the Sri Lankan delegation to the first Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. Soon he developed a lucrative law practice by dint of hard work and punctuality and treating his clients and opponents without denigrating or disparaging them.
Later he joined G. G. Ponnambalam's chambers. I met Sunil quite by accident when I was stranded at the Ratnapura bus stand on my way to the Rakwana Magistrate's Court to give medical evidence. I managed to hitch a ride to the Pelmadulla rest house where I met Sunil sipping a scotch. He invited me to have a drink with him and join him for dinner, both of which I demurred but he persuaded me to join him as I believe he guessed the reason for my hesitancy.
The next day when I went to check out, I found out that not only had Sunil paid my bill but he was offering a ride in his chauffeur driven Mercedes Benz to the courthouse in Rakwana. This event in the early 1960's was the beginning of a life-long friendship.
In spite of his short temper, he was a very generous man and always sided with the underdog. Thus when the Health Department declined to grant me leave of absence to accept a Fellowship at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sunil intervened pro-Bono on my behalf and obtained the leave. On most evenings his veranda was like a club house with clients and junior lawyers discussing various topics.
President Ranasinghe Premadasa on becoming president offered the Sri Lanka ambassadorship to London to Sunil which he declined, but as an appeasement to the president, he accepted the Chairmanship of Lake House for a short time.
Sunil had an extensive knowledge of the history, flora, and fauna of Sri Lanka. He collected old Sri Lanka books and coins. On our various trips to the National Parks, he always carried a pair of binoculars and his tattered book on birds of Ceylon.
We endlessly discussed various topics of Sri Lankan history such as urn burials practiced by the pre-Vijayan inhabitants of Thambapani or that Kudrimali the ancient port city in North Western Sri Lanka where horses were imported as Hippuros mentioned in Ptolemy's map of Taprobane.

Terence Ashely Peiris and Leela Rosemund Peiris
Grandparents who cannot be forgotten
It is with deep sorrow and affection that I write this appreciation of my beloved maternal grand parents, Terence Ashely Peiris and Leela Rosemund Peiris whom I called Ber. Thaththa and Am Amma from my childhood.
While Ber Thaththa passed away on December 9, 2003 at the age of 77 , Am Amma went to be with Jesus just one year ago.
She passed away on January 21, 2016 at the age of 82. I was born on the same day of their 26th wedding anniversary and was lucky to get their love and affection as their first grand child.
They married on April 30, 1953 and with the strength and courage received from our Lord Almighty they lived an exemplary and happy wedded life together and even celebrated their Golden Wedding in April 2003, with a reception at Galle Face Hotel which was also the venue of their wedding reception. I too had the opportunity of celebrating my birthday jointly with them this day.
Am Amma was a loving wife to Ber Thaththa and was behind him in all what he did and looked after him well until his death.
Both were loving grand parents not only to me, but also to my two cousins Trishan and Shiran. We enjoyed every moment being together with them.
Even though Ber Thaththa could not see our own children, Am Amma was lucky enough to see five great grandchildren. She was a tower of strength to the family and was admired by all.
Dearest Ber Thaththa and Am Amma, you loved me so much and I always thank Jesus for giving me such loving grand parents. I thank you for all what you have done for me from the day I was born as your eldest grandchild. Both of you will always remain in my mind forever.
In God's care you rest above
while in our hearts you dwell with love
May God Almighty grant peace and eternal rest to their souls

He excelled in whatever he did
A light has gone out without so much as a flicker. All that is left is the precious memory how brightly it burnt and the warmth it gave us while it lasted.
My beloved brother fought a relentless battle for his life with courage and determination for five long years never showing a defeatist attitude but with the help of the medical specialists at his behest to finally succumb to his fate with a giving ministering angel his wife who stood to her task against all odds to see her man through the difficult times and such was her dedication for the cause.
Born on June 16, 1943, Bunny as he was fondly called, was the fifth in a line of siblings of five boys and three girls and the showed early brilliance in his studies and had the distinction of reading for his degree at the University of Peradeniya passing out as a Science Graduate much to our delight and little did he realise that his intended brother-in-law to be Anver Dole was also passing out with an Honours Degree in Chemistry adding more impetus to the families at large.
With a penchant for the uniform and now armed with Degree he then sought enlistment in the Sri Lanka Navy and was the first batch of Graduates to be commissioned as Cadet Officers and later to be commissioned Electrical Officers almost following in the foot steps of his late father who too identified himself as an engineer attached to the then Government Department of Electrical Undertakings.
He along with his batch mates were sent to India for advanced training and they covered themselves with distinction having left an indelible imprint at the Indian Naval Establishments as I.N.S. Shivaji and Lonovla.
A lieutenant by rank, wedding bells were to chime and the lot fell, on me do to the Honours and I stood to my task having first to find his partner and then to see through the ceremony which was to be a service wedding.
My proudest moment came when I had to lead him, keeping steps with him on his Here comes the Groom march played to the strains by the Navy band in attendance.
It was sheer joy to see the couple ultimately emerging out of a Guard of Honour arranged by his co-officers of the Navy.
With the passage of time with the new arrivals to form a happy family in the making initially with baby Nirfan to be followed with by a bundle of joy Imran brought them immense happiness.
He went on premature retirement and during this period he sought employment as an electrical officer in the distant Midway Islands which was a US Based establishment and was he delighted to be with the Goon Birds to keep him entertained. Indulging in sports to ward off the boredom he was crowned the undisputed Bowling Champ for two consecutive years.
Back to Welisara he had the distinction of establishing the first Naval Artificer Training Institute which today stands testimony to his dedication towards a worthy undertaking.
A voracious reader and a lover of classical music he thus spent his leisure hours most diligently.
He leaves his wife along with his sons and their extended families and the only grand daughter Alina.

Lalitha Pathiratne
Loving mother and friend,silent social worker
The second death anniversary of Lalitha Pathiratne fell on September 29, 2016 with much feelings.
Feelings of happiness for the beautiful memories we have of her. Feelings of sadness that she is no more with us to share life's joys and sorrows.
We miss her but we know that she is free from pain now. We remember her as a loving mother and friend and silent social worker with love and gratitude.
She hailed from a distinguished family from Matara. It could be said that there was a place in her magnanimous heart for every person she came in contact with.
She was also respected by one and all for her sympathy, affection and compassion. She was also one who walked among the cream of society but never lost the common touch.
She was of unique calibre. We loved her in life and we will not forget her in death.
Her passing away came as an irreparable loss to all. She was married to Wilmot Gamage of Galle who served in the ports of Colombo and Galle for nearly 30 years.
She was blessed with five children. He eldest son Indika is employed as a manager in Kalutara. He elder daughter Anuradha is married to a businessman of Matara and her younger son Buddhika is also employed as a manager.
I will be failing in my duty if I don't mention her cousin sister Indrani Senanayake who looked after he as a Florence Nightingale during her long illness at her home at Walgama Matara.
May she attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana

brinjal binge
Vegetables are the most important part of a meal. From our childhood our parents lay much emphasis on the importance of consuming vegetables. Once you get used to it you can't do without it. In Sri Lanka 'Batu' is one vegetable that is immensely popular. It is a Sri Lankan food that is used widely throughout the island. Garden Talk met up with Assistant Director of Agriculture Sajeevi Wickrematillake to discuss this vegetable that is a favorite in our island.
"In Sri Lanka Vambatu/Brinjals (Solanum Melongena) is widely cultivated and used. Two other species are Thibbatu (Solanum Torvum) and Thalanabatu are grown in the Dry Zone. Vambatu is grown in the Low Country Wet Zone and Dry Zone. In the Up Country Wet Zone Vambatu is not grown much. From Low Country vegetables Vambatu is the second most extensively grown vegetable," said Wickrematillake
There are many varieties of Brinjals. From them the following varieties have been recommended by the Department of Agriculture -
* SM 164
* Thinneweli Purple
* Padagoda
* Amanda and Anjali (Local Hybrids)
Sajeevi Wickrematillake
There is another variety called Leneirri that is not recommended but is very popular amongst the farmers. In addition to this there are hybrid varieties brought from abroad. These are Purple Long and Swing. These are foreign hybrid varieties. They have been introduced by the Private Sector. But these have not been recommended by the Agriculture Department. So these are grown to a certain extent," stated Wickrematillake.
The origin of Batu is from India. It was also seen in China and then spread to other Asian countries.
"Batu can be used for many food purposes. It can be used to make a curry and can also be made into a pickle. From Thibbatu one can make a sambol. In South Asia, South East Asia and South Africa it is called Eggplant. In North America and Australia it is also referred as Eggplant. The British call it Aubergine. Brinjals is popular throughout Sri Lanka," pointed out Wickrematillake.
Thibbatu even though not very popular in the past is gaining in popularity in Sri Lanka.
"This is because Thibbatu is done on a commercial scale in the Dry Zone in Sri Lanka. This is because even though elephants generally pose a threat to cultivation, Thibbatu is not damaged by elephants. So without any loss you can get a good harvest from Thibbatu and get a good income. Thalanabatu is also grown on a commercial scale in the Dry Zone," added Wickrematillake
When it comes to Brinjal varieties there is a difference in colour and appearance.
"The purple comes from the Anthocyanine pigment. Depending on the concentration and the deposited amount of the pigment, the appearance differs. If you take SM 164, the pigment concentration and deposited amount is relatively less. It is a lighter shade of purple. When you take Thinnaweli Purple the pigment concentration is relatively high. It is a deep purple. The trunk is also deep purple and the entire fruit is a deep purple color. Even the leaves are a purple and green mix. The flowers are also a deep purple. Padagoda also has a relatively less concentration of the pigment," explained Wickrematillake
Brinjals and Thibbatu also have great medicinal value.
"The Anthocyanine pigment is good for heart diseases. The Nasunin pigment also present improves blood flow to the brain. It is also good for diabetes. It decreases the risk for obesity. And it promotes healthy complexion and hair," added Wickrematillake
Brinjals are not properly exported from Sri Lanka.
"We do not meet the export qualities. We have shortcomings. There are also various pest and disease problems. Also our farmers apply pesticides and these residues accumulate. Mature plants. Mature plants are affected by bacterial wilt, a disease that affects all plants that belong to the Solanaceae family," said Wickrematillake
It affects the upper portion of the plant making it wither. After that the rest of the plant withers in the space of two days and dies. The bacteria comes in through the roots and goes through the Xylum cells. It enters through the root system.
"This is because water sucked from the roots is distributed to the rest of the plant through the Xylum cells. So that is how the plant withers. The family Solanaceae is susceptible to that bacteria," said Wickrematillake.
Fungi infection also causes rotting. There are three types of these Fungi - Fusarium Species, Rhizoctonia Solani and Sclerotium Rolfsii. Here the portion of the trunk closest to the soil rots. Even the roots rot. There is a discoloration.
"When it comes to Pests, the 'Shoot and Stem Borer' is the biggest problem. Stem borer is an adult moth. It attacks the shoots, the tender leaves and the fruit, laying its eggs there and then the worm that comes out of the eggs starts eating the plant from inside. Another pest is the Spidermite," she said.
"It sucks the juice and the leaves turn a copper color. Then we know it is a mite attack. It attacks the fruit as well and the fruit loses its pigment and turns white. The fruit and leaves also loses their form and goes out of shape," noted Wickrematillake.
NUTRIENTS CONTAINED IN100g of Vambatu

HOW TO PREVENT AGAINST THE DISEASES
* When making the nursery in the wet zone, it must have adequate sunlight.
* The water must not collect in the soil. It must drain well
* The Agriculture department recommends when planning Vambatu, that there should be a 60cm distance between two plants and a 90cm distance between two lines of Vambatu plants. (This is to control the humidity. Increase in humidity causes diseases)
* Day temperature has to be between Celsius 27 - 32
* Night Temperature has to be between Celsius 21 - 27
* In the Dry Zone if you irrigate every five days it is ok
* The soil PH value has to be between 5.5 - 6.8
* Also the weeds in the field need to be controlled because some pests can be found in the weeds
* The field can also be covered by an insect net 2m high, this is to protect against moths
* Irrigation is necessary and a good drainage system.

Chief Ministers meeting with MR end in stalemate
The talks between the Chief Ministers representing the SLFP and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa failed to reconcile the divided factions of the party and ended with no agreement yesterday morning.
Joint Opposition MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena speaking to the Daily News yesterday said the Chief Ministers proposals were not well received by Rajapaksa.
Chief Ministers of six Provinces met the former President at his official residence at Wijerama Mawatha, Colombo to discuss how to unite the party and take it forward. Abeywardena who participated in the meeting said the former President was clear that peace talks of that nature was futile at a time the leading political figures of his camp were subjected to a political witch-hunt and revenge taking.
The Chief Ministers said they want to protect the party without letting it to be divided. They invited us to work together. Former President Rajapaksa stressed the party was not divided by him, but on the day some contested the elections with the UNP. He said by and large the accusation of dividing the party should be borne by the other group in the government, Abeywardena explained.
The MP pointed out that any attempt to work together must be reciprocal, adding that this type of negotiations, while openly insulting the former President would not help to resolve the problems.
We asked the Chief Ministers to dwell on these matters and come back if they wish to discuss on the future course of action, he said.
Asked whether any arrangement with regard to the upcoming Local Government Elections was discussed, Abeywardena said there was no point in wasting time discussing about it when the government is hesitant to hold the elections. Let the government declare the elections first, then we will talk about it, he said.
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya speaking to the Daily News confirmed that there was no final agreement, but said the discussions would continue to reach a common ground.
The problems faced by both factions were stated at the meeting. Many political issues were discussed and there were arguments too. We were informed of the grievances on the part of the former Presidents group, he commented.
Former President Rajapaksa speaking to the media following the meeting said there is little hope of reconciling while a group in the SLFP is working within the UNP government. The Chief Ministers met me with the approval of President Maithripala Sirisena. We stated our stance clearly to them. However, we are open for discussions at any time, he added.
Chief Ministers of Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, Southern, North Western and Uva attended the meeting while North Central Province Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne was absent. MPs Gamini Lokuge, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Bandula Gunawardena, Prasanna Ranatunga and Johnston Fernando and former MP Prof. G.L. Peiris participated along with former President Rajapaksa.

Chinas economy grows  6.7% in 2016
China's economy grew by 6.7% in 2016, compared with 6.9% a year earlier, according to official data, marking its slowest growth since 1990.
The figure is in line with Beijing's growth target of between 6.5% and 7%.
But the data comes days after the leader of one Chinese province admitted GDP data was faked for several years.
China is a key driver of the global economy and a growth slowdown is a major concern for investors around the world.
Some analysts have taken heart from data showing growth in the last three months of 2016 was at an annual rate of 6.8% - a slightly faster pace than the rest of the year.
But many observers have been saying for years that the country's growth was actually much weaker than the official data suggests.
And those beliefs gained more support this week, when the governor of Liaoning, Chen Qiufa, said his province had been "involved in a large-scale financial deception" between 2011 and 2014, and that economic data had been doctored.
Addressing reporters' questions about the Liaoning admission, the director of the National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday that the national data was "truthful and reliable".
Ning Jizhe added that "statistics departments on various levels will also be strengthening the law enforcement, supervision, and checks on figures" and "resolutely guarding and preventing" the fabricating of data.
China is the world's second-biggest importer of both goods and commercial services, meaning its economic performance has a big knock-on impact around the world. BBC News

Let us be proud of the GSP +
Whatever the Joint Opposition clamours citing numerous allegations against the government for gaining the GSP + facility again, right thinking people of this country should be proud and happy that the Government was able to get it back with its two years of successful tenure of office.
It is an apparent fact the GSP + concession enjoyed by Sri Lanka since 1990 had been withdrawn by the EU in 2010 due to the alleged violations of human rights, depriving the rights of the press, eliminating democracy and paving the country into dictatorial rule. Despite the withdrawal of the GSP, the country lost millions during the past six years. The export of the apparel to the European countries has been hampered and employment opportunities in the apparel sector to the youths was drastically reduced. The ordinary people suffered immensely due to the escalating unemployment rate in the country.
Even if the Government has to abide to certain legitimate conditions laid by the EU it is very much advisable and appropriate to gain the GSP + again to prosper the export market in overseas.
I foresee that there is nothing wrong in decentralizing powers to the provinces under the new proposed constitution because the people of our country are going to enjoy and get benefits from it. Further, repealing the terrorism act also can be considered because terrorism has already ended and another strong security legislation could be brought in, as an alternative, firmly strengthening the sovereignty and integrity of Sri Lanka.
The next is expediting the court cases handled by the FCID which could be done easily by establishing a separate legally empowered court.

Civil Society activists stress need to abolish Executive Presidential system
Civil Society activists stressed the necessity of abolishing the Executive Presidential system when they met with Government political party representatives last evening to discuss Constitutional reforms.
The meeting was attended by Ministers Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Mangala Samaraweera, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, Duminda Dissanayake, Mano Ganesan, Deputy Ministers Dr. Harsha de Silva, Eran Wickremaratne and Constitutional Lawyer MP Dr. Jayampathi Wickremaratne.

Speaking to the Daily News yesterday Puravesi Balaya Co-convenor Gamini Viyangoda said there was a general agreement in the meeting that the Executive Presidency should be abolished.
He said Civil Society representatives forwarded a road map to the Government on how to approach the people on the new Constitution and devolution of power.
We believe if all political parties, the SLFP, UNP, JVP, TNA and SLMC come together we can win the referendum with no difficulty, Viyangoda said.
Speaking to the Daily News National Dialogue Minister Mano Ganesan said SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake was not explicit about the abolition of the Executive Presidency.
He did not say that they were against the abolition of the Executive Presidency. He spoke about certain difficulties they have faced in that regard in the party.

The Match Committee came to the decision following a protest lodged by Renown SC.
Renown took an early 2-0 lead over Solid SC in the first half with goals from M.I.M. Mujib and Mohamed Fazal. Even in the second half Solid SC did not pose a challenge and Mohamed Rifnas and Job Michel added two more goals in the 61st and 74th minutes respectively.
A rare incident occurred in the match between Colombo FC and Army SC where goal keepers of both teams were issued with red cards by the referee G. N. Robes for their bad conduct. Both teams had to play the match with substitute goal keepers. Mohamed Yapo tactfully converted a free kick into a goal in the 26th minute claiming 1-0 first half lead for Renown SC. Bandara Warakagoda booted the equaliser for Army in the 62nd minute, but soon after Mohamed Sarwan netted the winning goal for Renown SC in the 83rd minute. The soldiers were unlucky as Mohamed Issadins two easy scoring attempt were declared offside.

The Diversified Sector meanwhile accounted for 29.00% (or LKR 1.12Bn) of the total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by JKH & Hemas Holdings which accounted for 93.03% sector turnover. Banking, Finance & Insurance Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 23.92% (or LKR 0.93Bn).

Point of View
The Colombo Bourse wiped off the majority of last week's gains, falling 48.1 points as investors adopted a watchful stance amid global and domestic policy uncertainty. Rising short term yields also continued to dampen investor appetite for equities with rates across 3-12M Government securities rising between 1-16Bps over the week; rates across short-term treasury yields have risen between 20-42 Bps since the close of 2016. Despite hitting a 6-day Index low on Thursday, daily turnover hit a 3-week high of LKR 1.55Bn amid strong interest by Institutional and HNI investors; Crossings over the week consequently amounted to 67% of the week's total turnover. Thursday's crossings accounted for 43% of the week's total crossings and 29% of the week's total turnover amid interest in RCL (62% of the day's total crossings) and Hemas Holdings (23% of the day's crossings). Thursday's heavy HNI and Institutional activity helped push the week's daily average turnover levels to LKR 0.77 Bn, 16% higher than the 2017 YTD average of LKR 0.67Bn. Foreign flows to the Colombo Bourse meanwhile turned positive for the first time in 2017, with net inflows to equities rising to LKR 0.35Bn relative to net outflows of LKR 0.73Bn last week and net outflows of LKR 0.97Bn in the 1st week of 2017. Markets in the week ahead are likely to remain lackluster.
IMF Forecasts Stronger Pace of Global Growth
The IMF on Monday took a relatively positive stance on 2017-2018 global growth, adding that data over H2'16 suggests somewhat greater growth momentum in 2017 from a number of important economies. The Group noted that world output in 2017 and 2018 is likely to pick up from last year's lackluster pace, with global growth projected to rise to 3.4% 2017 and 3.6% in 2018 (cf. 3.1% in 2016).
Growth is expected to arise from improvements in some large emerging market (especially China) and low income economies that were particularly pressurized in 2016, along with better prospects in the US, Europe, and Japan.
The Group noted that its forecast is based on assumptions of i) a changing policy mix (near-term fiscal stimulus and a less gradual normalization of monetary policy) under the new US administration and its global spillovers and, ii) firming oil prices following the agreement among OPEC members and several other major producers to limit supply.
The IMF cautioned however, that there is a wider dispersion of risks to its short-term forecast, due to the uncertainty surrounding the policy stance of the incoming U.S. administration and its global ramifications1.
The Group also noted that unraveling consensus over cross-border economic integration, underlying vulnerabilities in some large emerging and Geopolitical risks remain key downside risks to Global growth.

Crowds as a guide
Newly elected American President Donald Trump appears to have something in common with the Joint Opposition here in Sri Lanka. The JO seems to have this obsession with crowd attendance at their rallies and measures its popularity in the numbers. Trump too, it seems, is swayed by crowds and took umbrage when the media allegedly understated the crowd numbers at his inauguration. Donald Trump drew less crowds than Hillary Clinton at his election rallies but won the polls in the end. Now Trump is accusing the media of giving out a truncated figure of the actual crowd presence at his swearing in at Washingtin DC. Trump complained that the media placed the crowd at a mere 250,000 whereas, in his estimate, some millions were present for the grand event.
Comparatively speaking, the Joint Opposition, which is a great fan of Trump, too likes to have the crowd attendance to its rallies in the hundreds of thousands and flaunt the numbers as a measure of its popularity. JO stalwart MP Rohitha Abeygoonawardena says that they were planning to bring a crowd of 500,000 to its Nugegoda rally, come Friday. Going by the MPs claim, one Sri Lankan in every forty would be present at Nugegoda to cheer lustily at the JO speakers. Perhaps, as an added incentive to draw in the crowds, claims are being made of a number government ministers mounting the JO platform at Nugegoda and that Priyankara Jayaratne had already fired the first salvo, with Ven Ratana Thera distancing himself from the government. This, the JO contends, will trigger a snowballing effect, with more government ministers joining.
Commonsense would make anyone, with a nodding acquaintance with politics, realise how untenable this claim could be. To begin with, the government today commands a two thirds majority in parliament and those, whom the JO says are planning to mount the Joint Opposition platform wouldnt want to commit political harakiri. National elections are four years away and a loss of a few government members to the Opposition is not going to make any significant dent in the regimes stability. For any major shift to occur, the SLFP members in the government have to defect en masse and no one in their right minds would bet on some 45 members of the SLFP to cross over in one go, to bring down the government. Besides, no member would throw away their ministerial portfolios to join a movement which has no leader. That is, a leader who could one day be President or Prime Minister. They would not want to join a band of aimless drifters.
On the other hand, the Nugegoda rally is being touted as the inaugural rally of the pohottuwa party, which is a party formed to oppose the government, and no government minister or MP would want to risk being expelled from the party (SLFP) and subsequently lose their parliament seat, with no election in the horizon. They only have to reflect on the fate that befell Prof. G.L. Peiris, who was expelled from the SLFP upon assuming office as the General Secretary of the fledgling party.
Be that as it may, crowd attendance at political rallies have never been a barometer for popularity of a political party. If that were the case Rohana Wijeweera would have been the first Executive President of Sri Lanka and not JRJ. Such was the crowd drawing capacity of the bearded Marxist. During the last Presidential election, Mahinda Rajapaksa was so carried away by the crowds at Polonnaruwa, the pocket borough of his rival, that he declared it a historical moment in the context of the crowds at a political rally in Polonnaruwa. Rajapaksa lost the seat by over 30,000 votes. On the other hand, the Common Candidate won handsomely in electorates where he was not even permitted to erect a stage, let alone drawing crowds.
Both, the UNP and SLFP, traditionally have a bloc vote of almost equal proportions and it is only the sizable floating vote that decides the outcome of an election. This is what was witnessed at the last Presidential election where the undecided voter turned the tables. Political rallies are usually attended by the hardcore supporters and are shunned by the silent, disaffected voter. Hence no accurate assessment could be made how crowd attendance reflect an actual vote count at an election.
Hence what is being planned on Friday is an exercise to impress television viewers with crowds, with some stations even going to the extent of doctoring the TV footage to amplify crowd attendance.
The JO, it is reported, has planned many such rallies across the country, with perhaps the same crowds bussed in to all the venues. It has also devised various strategies to boost the popularity or perhaps make Mahinda Rajapaksa a heroic figure. A pro-Opposition newspaper had reported as its main story the other day of Mahinda Rajapaksa being asked to quit politics by two powerful countries. This way, the JO hopes to portray the picture of a Rajapaksa, who not only has to contend with the government, but also powerful nations.

EDEX encourages  youth to  be globally competitive - Dr. Harsha
The regaining of the GSP+ facility by Sri Lanka will immensely help our exporters to get back the duty free access to the European market and this will also help our youth to become globally competitive in the years to come, acting Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said.
The Minister made these remarks at the EDEX Expo-2017 Exhibition opening ceremony at BMICH.
A large number of present and past Royalists and astudents from other schools attended the opening ceremony to visit local and foreign education stalls and the job fair, conducted by Sri Lankan private sector organizations.

Editor, edit thyself
As an editor-in-chief at two American publishing houses, Simon and Schuster and Alfred A. Knopf, from the mid-1960s through the late 80s, and as the Editor of the New Yorker from 198297, Robert Gottlieb has coddled and hectored more important American writers (and some British) than anyone since Maxwell Perkins dealt with the distinctions and deficiencies in the prose and egos of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, James Jones, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings and Thomas Wolfe. A partial list of Gottliebs writers would include Sybille Bedford, Anthony Burgess, John Cheever, Michael Crichton, Don DeLillo, Margaret Drabble, Joseph Heller, John le Carr, Doris Lessing, Toni Morrison, V. S. Naipaul, Edna OBrien and Salman Rushdie. His non-fiction author list is equally impressive. He has worked with Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Paul Simon. Under his care, writers have won the Man Booker, National Book Awards, Pulitzer and Nobel Prizes. Now eighty-five and back at Knopf, Gottlieb is still going strong.
Given his involvement with so much talent, it is not surprising that Gottlieb was regularly encouraged by his friends to write about his professional life. He resisted. Why In a Paris Review interview (1994), he explained: I dislike writing: its very, very hard. Im a talking animal, not a typing one. Eventually, he caved in, but he could not entirely overcome his aversion, and his memoir carries the hallmarks of hasty composition or cursory editing, or both. As Le Carr put it, Bob is voluble, speaks wonderfully and writes boringly . . . . He is all creative impulse and no creativity. Avid Reader: A life is full of stale phrases, sketchy anecdotes and perfunctory accolades for all the wonderful guys and gals hes worked with over the years. Many paragraphs begin with And then came . . . or other lazy transitions. For long stretches, his memoir is a dog-trot along the road of lit biz: blurbs, reviews, sales figures (Calories Dont Count sold two million copies), jacket designs, print runs, and display ads (our ads, everyone acknowledged, were the best in the business). As I read, I kept muttering, Editor, edit thyself!
In compensation, Avid Reader is studded with accounts of how he solved stylistic and personal problems with his horde of idiosyncratic scribblers. Gottlieb was open to every solution, and had a different one for every writer. Some authors moved in with him and his wife, the actress Maria Tucci (Burgess for one). With others, he ate tuna fish sandwiches while sitting on the floor of his office (Le Carr tired of these meals and had a clause added to his contract calling for Gottlieb to take him to a fancy restaurant). Unlike most editors, he reads first drafts in days, sometimes overnight, a habit that has endeared him to his writers, most of whom waited in a state of suspended emotional and psychic animation for his response  a quick, honest estimate, and later, if necessary, a line-edit of the manuscript. I have fixed more bad sentences, he says, than most people have read in their lives. His mantra is Do it now. Get it done. Check, check, and check again. Widely read in virtually every prose genre, Gottlieb has an eye for structure. He agreed to take on Chaim Potoks novel The Chosen (1967) only if the author went along with his judgement that the novel reached its natural end halfway through the manuscript. Potok acquiesced and also accepted the title, which had been suggested to Gottlieb by a friend he bumped into going to the mens room. The Chosen was both a critical success and a number one bestseller.
Not all editorial fixes were this easy. Lauren Bacall had an enviable fluency as a writer but was insecure about her abilities as an actor, and had no idea what kind of routine was needed to write a full-length memoir. Gottlieb arranged for her to have an office at Knopf, and she came in daily, working in longhand on long yellow legal pads, wandering around the office in her stockinged feet, getting coffee for herself, and chatting with the gang. Each evening, the office staff would type up the days output for Gottlieb to read the next day. The only disagreement came when Bacall saw that while the front cover of By Myself was to carry two striking photos of Bacall, the back would feature her and her first husband, Humphrey Bogart.
Absolutely not, she exploded; this was her book, not his. That really pushed my buttons. Listen, Bacall, I said, people want to know about you and him, and youve written hundreds of pages about him. Its my job to sell your book, hes the major selling point, and hes going on the back cover. Fine, she said. Like most actors, she responded positively to a strong directorial hand.
One of Gottliebs happiest collaborations has been with Toni Morrison, whom he convinced to quit her day job as a Random House editor, and devote herself to writing full time. After Knopf published Morrisons second novel, Sula (1973), which Gottlieb likens to a sonnet  its contained, its precise, its utterly controlled  he told her she should open up and attempt something more ambitious. She then wrote Song of Solomon (1977), which was cited in her 1993 Nobel speech. Morrison is almost exactly Gottliebs age, and like him possesses a deep knowledge of the novelistic tradition. More important, he says, we read the same way, so that when I make a suggestion, she instantly knows why, whether its about a sentence or involves a major structural issue. When he suggested that the final third of one of her novels needed to be bulked up, she saw why and solved the problem swiftly, perfectly, and untemperamentally.

Every day was a challenge
Luck by chance turned him into a model. Fortune had many accolades in store for him. Designer and fashion model Tymeron Huban Carvalho bagged the Asias Top Fashion Male Model of the Year at the Fashion Asia Awards 2016 in China recently.
He was also named the Best Model of the World 2013 in Spain. He even has his own designer label. A fit body, shining personality, dedication, determination and a friendly smile sums up the lad who is now one of the most sought after male models in the industry.
Q: Being named Asias Top Fashion Male Model of the Year is quite a feat. Your thoughts
A: Yes, to be honest it still hasnt quite hit me because of all the hype and the interviews and work that has followed this victory. However when I do get occasional moments to reflect on that journey, it still makes me smile and my heart skip a beat.
Q: Apart from the finale, what was the most enjoyable moment at Fashion Asia Awards 2016 for you
A: I must say the entire week in China was remarkable with everyone from Sri Lanka grouping together and having lots of fun. Every day was a challenge just trying to order simple things like food!
Q: What was the toughest moment at the event
A: I guess the final moments before the announcement!
Q: You were also Best Model of the World 2013. Did that experience help you win Asias Top Fashion Male Model of the Year
A: I was very young at that competition. That win was bittersweet for me as I had just lost my mother and many people put me under undue pressure.
This, however, made me a lot stronger and more determined to succeed. Even though this was many years later, I also had the experience which is what really gave me the needed push.
Q: What is most fulfilling about being a male model
A: I guess it is being the best body form for a designer to work on.
Q: Are you an outdoor person or an indoor person What do you like doing outdoors/indoors

Ex-Maldivian leader wants to save sinking nation
US: He faces jail in the Maldives, but former president Mohamed Nasheed says he wants to contest elections and guide his island nation away from environmental catastrophe.
Nasheed became the first democratically elected president of the Maldives in 2008 but lives in exile in London after he was jailed on terrorism charges he says were politically motivated.
I dont think I can return home without risks. I dont think there will ever be a time for that, the 49-year-old told AFP during a visit to the Sundance Film Festival in Utah.
Former Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed.
I guess Ill have to take the risks and do it, if I were to do it.
In the past he has accused Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled the Maldives for 30 years and is still regarded as the power behind the throne, of being behind his downfall.
But in September he indicated he wanted to bury the hatchet with Gayoom, amid reports of a rift between the former strongman leader and his half-brother, current President Abdulla Yameen.
We are still working on it. What we would really like to see is a free and fair election -- not necessarily changing the government now, he told AFP.
I dont think we will have a free and fair election as things stand now. So we will have to have the whole opposition together and come out with a single candidate.
Once a honeymoon paradise before its tourism industry was shaken by political unrest, the Indian Ocean island chain could be underwater by 2100, according to the United Nations.
Its already happening in the Maldives, it isnt something that is going to happen. We are already going through it, said Nasheed. He said that 16 of the 196 inhabitable islands already needed to be evacuated.
Nasheed is pushing for the Maldives to use its own resources rather than international aid to bolster its defenses against rising seas, damage to its precious coral and coastal erosion.
To do that, we must have investor confidence, for us to bring the money into the country. It is my view that we have enough resources, he told AFP.
Investment has stopped because of corruption, he says, citing what he describes as the unlawful termination of construction contracts by Yameens government.
In October last year the country was ordered by an arbitration panel in Singapore to pay Indian construction firm GMR $270 million after cancelling a contract to build the airport near Male.
Nasheed says the government reneged on the deal to allow another company paying big backhanders to step in.
The politician is at Sundance to take part in a climate change discussion panel on Sunday with former US president Al Gore, now a celebrated environmental champion.
The Maldivian rails against the argument forwarded by developing economies such as India that they are entitled to as many years of polluting the environment as the West was allowed.
This is like saying the West has brought us to the brink and therefore now the developing countries must have the opportunity to push us off the cliff, he told AFP.
A crackdown on political dissent in the nation of 340,000 has dented its popular image as an upmarket holiday paradise in recent years.
Almost all key opposition leaders and a number of ruling party dissidents have either been jailed or gone into exile since Yameen took office after winning a controversial run-off election against Nasheed in 2013. Nasheed was jailed for 13 years in 2015 but granted prison leave last year for medical treatment in London, where he secured political asylum.
A UN panel has ruled that his imprisonment was illegal and ordered the regime to pay him compensation. -AFP

Government to boost public transport system
The government has decided to maintain the public transport system even at a loss for the benefit of the public, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
Speaking at the the initiation of a new express train service from Colombo Fort to Matale at the Colombo Fort station, the minister said that over the years, the public transport service had rendered yeoman service to the public even though incurring losses. Therefore, We have drawn up more plans to develop the public transport system, specially the railway service.
Under this programme, 160 new compartments and 20 engines would be brought to Sri Lanka under the Indian Concessionary loan scheme. We are also considering importing train engines manufactured in Europe to be deployed on the up country railway line, he said.
We have to develop a high-speed rail system to connect major cities for the benefit of the commuters. There are those who want trains to stop at every station, while some others wish for more express trains. So we will balance all these concerns and try to provide a good train service, the Minister de Silva said. Steps taken to transport coal by train had been more profitable and owing to this, road congestion, air pollution and accidents have been minimized, he added. Nearly 90 trucks are used per day for the transport of coal from Trincomalee to Mahawa, which has created huge traffic congestion and air pollution. This has been brought to an end with our initiatives, he added.

Hameedias Refresh your Wardrobe campaign
To be sartorially smart, every Sri Lankan man should refresh and re-invest in his wardrobe every few years, celebrity fashion stylist and Managing Director of Hameedia, Fouzul Hameed said.
He advises that spending judiciously on a few on-point items that complement and rejuvenate what one already has, requires a keen eye for shifting proportions and accessories, as well as a clear view of what suits ones body and profile.
It is thus every mans responsibility to refresh his wardrobe. We are going a step further and making it easier for young men out there to give away their old clothes which are in good condition and avail themselves of a redeemable voucher which they can use to purchase clothes at any of our stores islandwide he said.
Aptly named Refresh your Wardrobe the campaign is currently operative at all Hameedia branches across the country. Customers will receive a Rs. 100/- redeemable voucher each for every shirt (long sleeved and short sleeved) pair of trousers and pair of shoes traded in. All items need to be clean and in wearable condition, segregated and packed separately and tagged as follows - male, female, children.
All clothes taken in by Hameedia will be given to charity and thus bring a smile on the faces of the less fortunate. We hope that through this endeavor not only will Sri Lankans be able to re-invest in and thus refresh their wardrobes but also be part of a charitable initiative that will touch the lives of a few thousand people islandwide, he said.
The Hameedia Group pays undivided attention to providing for the less fortunate around and making a significant difference in their lives. So also is Hameedias principal CSR project My Friend (www.myfriend.lk) which, since 2013, has been bringing about a tangible change in lives of little children around us.
These children are our future. They need to be fed, clothed and educated. It is our duty to lend a helping hand to the less fortunate around us and make this world a better place. That what the My Friend Project is all about, Hameed added.

Injured Mathews wins it for Sri Lanka
Johannesburg: Injured captain Angelo Mathews hit two sixes in the last over to hand Sri Lanka a series-levelling three-wicket win in the second Twenty20 international against South Africa on Sunday.
But the win came at a cost. Mathews said at the after-match presentation that he could miss the rest of the tour after twisting his right ankle when he dived to avoid being run out in the penultimate over.
"It's pretty bad, I think I will be out for a couple of weeks," said Mathews, who made 54 not out as Sri Lanka chased down a low South African total of 113 with two balls to spare. The third and final Twenty20 international will be played in Cape Town on Wednesday, followed by five one-day internationals, finishing on February 10.
On an unusually dry, slow Wanderers pitch, South Africa were bowled out in 19.3 overs. Left-arm wrist spinner Lakshan Sandakan, playing in his first T20 international -- although he has played in three Test matches and a one-day international -- took four for 23 and bamboozled the South African batsmen with his ability to spin the ball both ways. Seamers Isara Udana and Nuwan Kulasekera took three for 13 and two for 10 respectively. Heino Kuhn top-scored for South Africa with 29.
New fast bowling discovery Lungi Ngidi gave South Africa hope of defending their low total, taking four for 19.
Ngidi, who was man of the match when South Africa won the first game in Centurion, took three wickets in an electrifying three-over opening spell, then came back to take another wicket in the 15th over, at the end of which Sri Lanka were 89 for four.
It came down to eight needed off the last seven balls when man of the match Mathews was injured after a risky leg bye. He managed to hobble a single off Wayne Parnell's last ball to keep the strike.
Mathews went for a big hit off the first ball of the last over, bowled by left-arm spinner Jon-Jon Smuts, and was dropped by a diving Heino Kuhn at deep midwicket.
He did not take a run. He hit the next ball for six to level the scores and two balls later finished the match with another six. "I had to hit sixes because I couldn't run," he said. South African captain Farhaan Behardien said: "On a deck that was a little bit slow, Sri Lanka kept taking wickets and we couldn't launch at the end.
"We were put under pressure today. But the guys really fought hard and I'm proud of them." AFP

Liverpool, Tottenham drop points, Rooney record
LONDON: Liverpool's defensive gremlins returned again as their Premier League title ambitions suffered a painful body blow in a shock 3-2 home defeat by relegation battlers Swansea City on Saturday.
In what turned out to be a great day for leaders Chelsea without kicking a ball, second-placed Tottenham Hotspur battled back to draw 2-2 at fifth-placed Manchester City and Manchester United were held 1-1 at Stoke City.
Wayne Rooney salvaged a point for United with a sublime free kick that made him the club's record scorer with 250 goals, one ahead of Old Trafford great Bobby Charlton.
Rooney's curler four minutes into stoppage time cancelled out an own goal from Juan Mata as United remained in sixth spot.
It means a hell of a lot. It is a great honour and I am very proud, the 31-year-old Rooney said.
It is difficult at the minute to be over-pleased because of the result but in the grand scheme it is huge honour.
Gylfi Sigurdsson's 74th-minute winner ended Liverpool's 17-match unbeaten league run at Anfield and left Juergen Klopp's side seven points behind leaders Chelsea who can widen their lead against strugglers Hull City on Sunday.
Spain striker Fernando Llorente scored twice shortly after halftime to put Swansea in charge but Liverpool retaliated and two goals by Roberto Firmino dragged them level.
Klopp's side were the first top-flight team to score 50 goals this season but their defensive deficiencies again proved a thorn in their side as memories of a 4-3 defeat at Bournemouth in December came flooding back minutes later. A Liverpool victory had looked the most likely outcome with half an hour left but Swansea had other ideas and from a rare foray forward the ball fell to Sigurdsson and the Icelander coolly put the Welsh side back ahead.
Liverpool could not respond, leaving Klopp crestfallen.
The most disappointing moment was the third goal and I can't explain it as we had so many chances to challenge, the German said.
It's really difficult to accept at this moment.
It is fair Swansea won, no - but was it deserved, yes.
Tottenham's six-match winning run was ended by City but it could have been far worse for Mauricio Pochettino's side in a compelling late kickoff at the Etihad.
City, smarting from last week's 4-0 drubbing at Everton, dominated a scoreless first half and were gifted a two-goal lead within nine minutes of the restart as howlers by Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris allowed Leroy Sane and Kevin de Bruyne to tap in.
Dele Alli and Son Heung-min replied for Tottenham but the visitors enjoyed a huge slice of good fortune seconds before Son's equaliser when Kyle Walker got away with a blatant shove in the back of Raheem Sterling as he seemed set to score.
It doesn't matter, we had the same argument against Chelsea but we lost because we missed a lot of chances. When you score a goal the ref doesn't matter, the rules here are the rules, City boss Pep Guardiola said, ruing a glut of missed chances.
We were outstanding, it's a pity. We created so many chances and were not able to score.
Tottenham moved clear in second spot, six points behind Chelsea, although Arsenal could rise above them with victory over Burnley on Sunday.
Improving West Ham United won for the fifth time in seven league games to move into the top half - Andy Carroll again on target with two goals in a 3-1 victory at Middlesbrough.
Sunderland sunk to the bottom after goals by West Bromwich Albion's Darren Fletcher and Chris Brunt condemned them to a fourth defeat in five league games.
Bournemouth drew 2-2 with Watford and Crystal Palace ended the day in the bottom three for the first time this season after a tame 1-0 home defeat by Everton, Seamus Coleman thumping home a late winner for the visitors.

Managing high blood pressure
Today Consultant Physician Dr. Lasantha Ganewatta (MBBS (SL), MD (Colombo), MRCP (UK), MRCP (London), DGM (Geriatrics) (UK), MRCP-SCE (Geriatrics) (UK) talks about High Blood pressure, one of the commonest health issues among elderly and even middle aged persons.
Q: What isnormal bloodpressure
A - Normal blood pressure is varied according to the age, existing diseases, organ impairments and acute illnesses. Usually it is taken as120/80mmHg or less than that in an otherwise healthy person as normal blood pressure. However in conditions like diabetes mellitus, heart diseases, strokes, kidney failures and in elderly, blood pressure cut-off values are changed to make sure a better outcome.
Q: What ishigh bloodpressure
A - Usually blood pressure more than 140/90 mmHg is taken as high blood pressure in an otherwise healthy person. If it is in between 120/80-140/90 mmHg are considered as vulnerable group to develop high blood pressure. To confirm it at least two consecutive measurements are taken and blood pressure is recorded twice daily ideally in the morning and evening for at least four days.
Q: What are the negative impacts of high blood pressure
A - There are several negative impacts of high or uncontrolled blood pressure. Commonly it is associated with increased risk of heart attacks, heart failure and strokes. In addition to that it leads to kidney failure and even to long term memory impairment. People develop visual problems including permanent visual loss secondary to high blood pressure. Blood vessels acquire irreversible damages due to persistent high pressures and ultimately lead to resistance for treatment. It is well recognized this could cause premature deaths.
Q: What treatments are available for high bloodpressure
A - Management of hypertension or high blood pressure is done by both pharmacological and non pharmacological ways. Both types of measures should be implemented together. There are many drugs of which some might be familiar to community as are known for years and decades. There are very potent new drugs also available. Commonly used drugs are Losartan, Enalapril, Nifedipine, HCT etc.
Dr. Lasantha Ganewatta
Non-pharmacological measures based on life style modification. There, healthy diet plays a major role. It is advised to cut down salt intake. Recommended amount is 5g or one tea spoon full for whole day for an adult. In addition to that reducing oily, starchy and sugary food from the diet is strongly advised. Adding more and more vegetables, green leaves, grains and fruits to your meals makes favourable effects on blood pressure. This kind of dietary modifications control body weight and improve other associated conditions like obesity, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol and heart problems.
Regular exercises following medical advice is very important to control high blood pressure. Two and half hours exercise per week in a divided manner is the minimum recommendation. Even usual teaching is to do half an hour exercises per day for five days per week, now it is advised to do it in any divided manner to complete two and half hours a week. Still it is beneficial. Brisk walking, cycling, swimming or going to the gymnasiums are commonly done to fulfil this requirement.
Relaxation and reducing the day-to-day stress are also an important risk modification. You could choose healthy methods to relax yourself like music, dancing, engaging in family and social events, meditation, Yoga etc. Doing exercises is also a way of relaxing.
Cut down or stopping consumption of alcohol is a well accepted measure to control blood pressure. Further, it prevents the occurrence of it as well. It is also strongly advised to stop smoking. It would help to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, lung problems, cancers and hundreds of associated heath problems other than controlling the blood pressure.
Q: How canwe preventblood pressure
A - First and foremost whole community needs to be aware of life style modifications discussed in the previous answer. In a family unit parents should be able to guide children to follow healthy life style from the beginning. Schools, offices and other industries should facilitate these measures and need to provide continuous health education and screening programmes. If you are diagnosed to have high blood pressure it is essential to follow medical advice and strictly adhere to medications.

Corporate earnings from major players like HCL Tech and L&T is set to be announced in the coming week; BSE is set to come up with it IPO from January 23. It is looking to raise over Rs 1,200 crore.
Corporate earnings, Budget expectations and global events may keep market volatile in the upcoming week. It is a truncated week as Indian market will remain shut on Republic Day holiday on January 26.
The Supreme Court will be hearing a petition on January 23 which will seek the postponement of the Union Budget due to the scheduled Assembly polls in five states. Any change in the Budget day may induce more volatility or even weakness in the market. In the week ended January 20, Indian investors remained cautious in tandem with global markets.
IT and pharma stocks saw selling pressure on Trump's views on visa issuances as well as drug pricing. Banking stocks too faced pressure on increase in asset quality concerns in the quarterly earnings. The Sensex ended lower by 274 points while the Nifty ended below 8350 as banks and IT stocks dragged the indices. Global markets last week witnessed volatile movements as investors were wary of key events such as US President Donald Trump's policy stance and Britain's exit roadmap from the European Union. European markets too remained choppy, sending the pound lower, as British PM Theresa May in a speech outlined her plan for a clear exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU).
The European Central Bank (ECB) left its key rates and bond buying programme unchanged and hinted that the stimulus package may increase if necessary. Here are the key events to watch out for next week. Corporate earnings Among the key earnings to watch out for will be the likes of FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL). A CNBC-TV18 poll estimates the company's profit to fall 0.5 percent in December quarter to Rs 967 crore, while the total income may fall 4 percent to Rs 7,450 crore.
Among other major companies announcing Q3 results will be HCL Technologies, Larsen and Toubro and L&T Finance.

Stocks from both the sectors had ended lower last week over these developments. Trump has maintained his stand on restricting the issue of H1-B visas, a development that will hit IT companies hard.

Melbourne Park carnage as top seeds topple
MELBOURNE, Sunday - The whiff of sporting upset hung around Melbourne Park on Sunday after top seeds Andy Murray and Angelique Kerber were handed stunning defeats in the Australian Open fourth round.
Britain's Murray was bamboozled by the serve-volley game of Mischa Zverev to exit after 3-1/2 hours on Rod Laver Arena, while fellow world number one Kerber's title defence was ended in little more than an hour by Coco Vandeweghe.
Murray was the first top seed to depart before the quarter-finals since Lleyton Hewitt in 2003, while Germany's reigning women's champion was last sent packing before the second week a decade ago when Amelie Mauresmo went out in the fourth round.
Murray and Kerber were playing their first grand slams as top seeds and both looked all but powerless to deal with the style of game they were confronted with from across the net.
Zverev, the world number 50, rushed the net 118 times to keep one of the best defensive players in the game on the backfoot for much of the contest before holding his nerve to close out the contest 7-5 5-7 6-2 6-4.
"Credit to him," said Murray. "He came up with great, great shots and played a really, really good match. You know, you always finish matches you lose with things you maybe could have done a bit better, but he played some really good stuff."
The German, ranked outside the top 1,000 in the world after wrist surgery two years ago, will face Roger Federer in his maiden grand slam quarter-final after the Swiss master outlasted Kei Nishikori 6-7(4) 6-4 6-1 4-6 6-3.
New Yorker Vandeweghe later hammered down 30 winners to Kerber's seven, overpowering the U.S. Open champion 6-2 6-3 to set up a meeting with Spanish seventh seed Garbine Muguruza in her first trip to the last eight in Melbourne.
Kerber made 15 unforced errors in a contest lasting little more than an hour and admitted it was simply not her day.
"It was a tough match and, of course, I'm disappointed," she said. "But I was not feeling the ball at all tonight. I was not playing good from the first point.  Agencies

Merriam-Webster sums up 2016 in one word: Surreal
Adjective joins post-truth and  xenophobia among lexicographers top choices to sum up annus horribilis that brought us Brexit chaos, Donald Trump, strikes and multiple celebrity deaths
Try something in between: surreal, which is US dictionary Merriam-Webster's word of the year.
Meaning marked by the intense irrational reality of a dream, or unbelievable, fantastic, the word joins Oxford's post-truth and Dictionary.com's xenophobia as the year's top choices.
It just seems like one of those years, said Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor-at-large.
The company tracks year-over-year growth and spikes in lookups of words on its website to come up with the top choice. This time around, there were many periods of interest in surreal throughout the year, often in the aftermath of tragedy, Sokolowski said. Major spikes came after the Brussels attack in March and again in July, after the Bastille Day massacre in Nice and the attempted coup in Turkey. All three received huge attention around the globe and had many in the media reaching for surreal to describe both the physical scenes and the mental landscapes, Sokolowski said.
The single biggest spike in lookups came in November, he said, specifically November 9, the day Donald Trump went from candidate to president-elect.
There were also smaller spikes, including after the death of Prince in April at age 57 and after the June shootings at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida.
Irony mixed with the surreal for yet another bump after the March death of Garry Shandling. His first sitcom, It's Garry Shandling's Show, premiered on Showtime in 1986 and had him busting through the fourth wall, speaking directly to the audience and mimicking his real life as a standup comedian, but one who knew he was starring in a TV show. It was surreal and it's connected to the actual original meaning of surreal, which is to say it comes from Surrealism, the artistic movement of the early 20th century, Sokolowski said.
Which is to say that surreal didn't exist as a word until around 1924, after a group of European poets, painters and filmmakers founded a movement they called Surrealism. They sought to access the truths of the unconscious mind by breaking down rational thought.
It wasn't until 1937 that surreal began to exist on its own, said Sokolowski, who is a lexicographer.
Merriam-Webster first started tracking lookup trends in 1996, when the dictionary landed online. In 2001, after the 9/11 terror attacks, the Springfield, Massachusetts-based company noticed plenty of spikes in word lookups. The most enduring spike was for surreal, pointing to a broader meaning and greater usage, Sokolowski said.

Minister vows to clean up SriLankan Airlines
Sri Lankas State Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim vowed to clean up the mafia at SriLankan Airlines and accused its Chairman Ajith Dias of sweeping corruption of the previous regime under the carpet.
The minister said he disagreed with Dias who had dismissed findings of a far reaching anti-corruption report that highlighted corruption and irregularities under the former regime of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He said the SriLankan board had been appointed soon after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe took office and he (the minister) had no direct control, but was clearly unhappy with the loss-making carriers management.
He said a mafia of the former regime was still operating at SriLankan and was being shielded by the management.
I regret that I have not been able to make any changes, but I am determined to clean up the place, Minister Hashim said.
I will not give up. I will fight to get rid of them.
I am clearly unhappy with the loss-making carriers management.

National Council for Deaf, a strength to hearing impaired children

He made these observations at the Annual General Meeting of the NCD in Colombo. NCD senior director Maud Senaratne and director Shirani Dissanayaka were also present. Balasubramaniam said no one can isolate this needy sector as they are also a part of the society.
He highly praised the welfare activities by NCD towards the deaf community in the country, especially schoolchildren.
Balasubramaniam said: The countrys technology has developed to maximum and we could use this development to provide more valuable service for these hearing impaired children too. It is happy to note that eminent personalities in the field of medicine including Prof. Priyani Soysa, Dr. Ananda Soysa and Dr. T.R. C. Ruberu are also the distinguished members in the NCD council.
He also said even researchers are concerned about the deaf community and innovative methods are being developed to address the challenges of providing tertiary education to those with deafness to excel both in practice and research in their chosen fields. He also thanked NCD for conducting individual speech training for deaf children. to enable them to integrate with other children. Senaratne said the Council is managing a school from Grade 1 to GCE (OL) for the benefit of deaf children of low income groups and thereafter these students will be directed to job orientation programmes enabling them to become employable.

LONDON: Newcastle United roared back to the top of the English Championship with a 4-0 demolition of Rotherham on Saturday, although they were frustrated for 45 minutes by the bottom club.
Daryl Murphy opened the scoring in first-half stoppage time and when Matt Ritchie scored from close range soon after the restart the points were in the bag.
Ritchie struck again after Ayoze Perez got in on the act.
Rafa Benitez's Newcastle have 58 points from 27 games with Brighton and Hove Albion, who beat Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 on Friday, a point behind with a game in hand.
With Newcastle and Brighton having a stranglehold on the top two spots the battle below them looks like being for playoff places, with Leeds United, Huddersfield Town, Reading and Sheffield Wednesday leading that race. Huddersfield bolstered their position with a 2-0 home win over Ipswich Town with Isaiah Brown and Christopher Schindler supplying the goals for the Terriers.
Reading suffered a 3-2 defeat at Derby County who are just outside the top six and Leeds lost 3-2 at Barnsley.
Nottingham Forest fans demonstrated against their club's plight but at least had something to cheer with a 1-0 victory over Bristol City - their first in eight matches - to ease their relegation fears.

As nuclear loss grows, Toshiba  needs chip investors, soon
With mounting writedowns from its nuclear business, Japan's Toshiba Corp is looking to sell part of its core semiconductors business, a world No.2 in the flash memory chips used in smartphones.
But its rush to plug a hole in its U.S. nuclear business that Japanese media now estimate at as much as $6 billion may complicate any asset sale.
Toshiba, which warned last month of multi-billion dollar charges for U.S. nuclear project cost overruns, wants to boost its capital base by the end of the financial year in March.
Failure to offset the nuclear hit could wipe out already thin shareholder equity and push the company into negative net worth - jeopardizing its role in public infrastructure projects and its place on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section, for larger companies.
Following a 2015 accounting scandal, the conglomerate is barred from raising fresh funding on equity markets. Selling assets, though, could help it win broader financial support from its main banks.
Toshiba could sell 20-30 percent of its chip business, according to media reports.
The business, worth more than $10 billion, is the world's second largest after Samsung Electronics in flash memory chips - and it's Toshiba's most profitable.
Operating profit is forecast at 130 billion yen ($1.13 billion) for the year to end-March, accounting for the bulk of overall group profit, forecast at 180 billion yen. Those forecasts were made before its December warning of the U.S. nuclear charges.
People with knowledge of the matter said Toshiba has begun preparations to sell a minority stake in its chip business. One person said non-disclosure agreement forms have been sent to some private equity funds.
Other people familiar with the matter have said potential buyers of a stake include Western Digital Corp, both a rival and a business partner, with a pledge to invest $5 billion to jointly produce memory chips. Western Digital, a California-based data storage company which operates a Japanese NAND flash memory plant with Toshiba, has declined to comment.
Any deal with Western Digital, however, could trigger a time-consuming antitrust review.
The short timeframe (for raising funds) could be a hurdle as (such) a capital infusion could raise antitrust concerns, a Toshiba executive said, noting such a review could take more than a year to complete. The person declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. Investors with no antitrust concerns will be preferable, but they tend to seek quick returns, so there are difficulties here as well.
Selling part of the chips business, formally called Storage & Electronic Devices Solutions, may also fuel concerns of earnings dilution. BBC

Over 25,000 school children, school leavers, university students and job seekers visited the three-day EDEX Expo-2017 Exhibition and Job Fair which ended at BMICH yesterday on a high note.

The visitors were keen on local and foreign educational courses and they were seen getting information from stalls run by educational institutions here and abroad.
The Daily News Business had the opportunity to interview few representatives in charge of stalls. Accordingly, many students wish to continue their higher studies in countries such as Australia, India, Japan, China, Canada, England, Malaysia and Bangladesh.
They say many students are keen on studying Engineering, Medicine, Information Technology, shipping and aviation related educational courses. Some students also like to remain in the country and study the same educational courses considering expenses.
A university student and an old girl of Devi Balika, Nimedani Weerakoon said she was not in a sound financial background and wish to follow a course while being employed.
She also said that many children are not in sound financial backgrounds and proposed EDEX authorities to arrange bank loans with low interests for the benefit of underprivileged youth.
A Japanese national Kinosu said their group conduct some educational stalls at the exhibition as many Sri Lankan students wish to study in Japan while being employed.
She said last year too large number of students from Sri Lanka visited Japan for higher education.
Minister Harsha de Silva was also seen talking to school children on their studies and future expectations. Students were also very keen to exchange their views with the Minister as well as the Japanese Ambassador who accompanied the Minister to stall along with the Principal, Royal College, B.A. Abeyratna and Chairman EDEX, Mahinda Galagedera.

Pakistan blunders blasted as Australia take ODI series
Sydney: Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur blasted his players after their blunders helped Australia secure their one-day series at Sydney Cricket Ground on Sunday, taking a 3-1 lead in the five match series.
Set an imposing 354 to win, Pakistan were never really in the hunt.
After Australia made 353 for six on the back of a David Warner century that was aided by appalling fielding from the tourists, Pakistan replied with 267 from 43.5 overs. A frustrated Arthur was left lamenting another sloppy fielding effort marked by a number of dropped catches.
"We can't compete with a side like Australia if we give their top five that many chances," he said. "It's unacceptable, those standards we set as a cricket team those standards haven't been met. Is it skill level, attitude, or is it fatigue"
Opener Sharjeel Khan, who dropped two catches in the Australian innings, whacked out 74 from just 47 balls, but once he fell to recalled leg-spinner Adam Zampa Pakistan's fate was all but sealed.
Warner backed his form with the bat by doing what the Pakistanis couldn't and hanging on to two excellent catches. He was pleased to have the series wrapped up ahead of the final game in Adelaide on Thursday, saying the team "played fantastic".
After Australian captain Steve Smith won the toss, the home side took advantage of a placid wicket and the hapless Pakistan fielding. Warner top-scored with 130 but Pakistan did not help themselves, conceding a number of overthrows and dropped catches at crucial times.
He was dropped on 113 when Hasan Ali grassed a simple chance at mid-off from spinner Imad Wasim.
Smith scored 49 off 48 balls, but was let off at 10 when Sharjeel made a lazy one-handed attempt at gully from Junaid Khan's bowling.
Sharjeel also dropped Travis Head when he was on 28, again to the chagrin of the luckless Junaid. Head went on to make 51.
And Hasan put down a difficult chance off Glenn Maxwell when he was on eight and the Australian ended on 78. Despite his two dropped catches Hasan redeemed himself by taking five for 52, easily the best of the Pakistan bowlers.
Warner and Smith put on 120 for the second wicket to put Australia in a commanding position before Hasan removed both in the space of three balls to give the tourists a lift.
However, Head and Maxwell then cut loose to add 100 for the fourth wicket in 64 balls. Pakistan recalled captain Azhar Ali after a hamstring injury at the expense of Asad Shafiq, while Australia recalled Mitchell Starc and spinner Zampa for James Faulkner and Billy Stanlake. Zampa, controversially overlooked for the upcoming India tour, took his opportunity with 3-55 from his 10 overs. AFP

Peace Air to operate six A380 aircraft from Mattala
Peace Air, one of the three bidders for the SriLankan Airlines deal has ordered for six A380 aircraft from another regional airline.
These would be branded and run under the Peace Air .
All the operations would be from the Mattala International Airport Hambantota.
According to Gamini Wethasinghe Managing Director of the company, the first two aircraft would arrive end of July. We hope to utilize these two aircraft for Muslim religious travel to Mecca.
Wethasinghe said that passengers would be fed to the airline from two destinations in the Far East allowing the airline to operate on a 80% load factor.
He said that by 2018 August two more aircraft would be fed to their operations and the last two would be joining the fleet by mid-2019. In addition we will also purchase two 175 seat aircraft by August this year to fly to SAARC destinations to feed in passengers to the A380s which would each have around 575 seat capacity.
The Managing Director said that the Peace Air operated a domestic airline service in Sri Lanka in the early 1980s and claimed that their international operations did not take off the ground since they were blocked by the then international player who was running the national carrier. I must also say that they had the political patronage to support it. I am now in the process of reactivating this license, he said.
Wethasinghe said that they would be buying the six A380 aircraft on a Lock Stock and Barrel agreement where the owners of the airline under take to take care of the mechanical side. We will also have local and foreign technicians in Mattala firstly to train local engineers in A380 operations and to also carry daily checks. (A checks)
We expect to offer over 1,200 employment form this venture by the end of 2017 and it will also help to generate revenue to Mattala airport, he said. Wethasinghe said that they were also been backed up by Lufthansa Consulting.
Peace Air, one of the three bidders for the SriLankan Airlines with an offer of USD 5.5 billion has also offered to take control of Mattala for US$ 2.2 billion. We have this money and have conformed to the National Saving Bank that its available through a SFIFT from an international bank, Wethasinghe added.

## Supertitle:

Is picking a stock an art, a science or both
The primary fact every person interested in stocks should keep in mind is that owning a stock of a company is equivalent to owning the company, which is why investing in stocks is referred to as an Equity investment.
Therefore, understanding the basic terminologies of a stock market takes top priority, followed by the knowledge of how to pick the right stock.
The stock market is the central location where people who have excess wealth and companies which are in need of capital meet to fulfill their needs and demands. Luckily, we are in the era where this meeting is routed electronically and is facilitated by the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), which is the only stock exchange in Sri Lanka and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The CSE is still at its infant stage in comparison to most of its peer stock exchanges. The GDP to market capitalization, a metric to measure the size of a stock exchange, is still hovering around 28.0% for Sri Lanka.
Factors that drive the stock market
The stock market, like any other market, is driven by demand and supply for the underlying commodity, which in this context, is called a stock. The demand for a particular stock is created due to the attractiveness of the company represented by that stock. In most cases, the movement of the price of a stock is a factor of the underlying fundamentals of the company.
However, in Sri Lanka, various other factors such as liquidity (how fast you can exit from a stock), participation of foreign investors and herd behavior (tendency of individuals to follow a larger group or high net worth Individuals (HNIs)) also help determine the price of a stock.
In addition to the aforesaid market-specific factors, global and local macro-economic and political developments also tend to impact price movements of the stock.
When the overall economy is poised to develop, the companies within the system will start to benefit which in turn will trickle down to the performance of the CSE. Hence, investors should keep updating their knowledge on the developments happening around them in order to be successful.
Equity: a high risk and high return investment
In finance, the amount of risk taken to an investment will be compensated by the return to the investor. Hence, an investor should be cautious about the risk factors associated with the stock market. Risk factors can vary from macro-economic to political risk known as systematic risk and individual stock related risk known as specific risk. While specific risk can be mitigated through diversification, systematic risk is supposed to be borne by all investors in the market. However, in general equity investments give protection against inflation risk as opposed to a fixed income investment.
Investor checklist
There are various theories and approaches on how to pick stocks; however, not all approaches would suit all investors. Over a period of time, investors should create their own method of picking a suitable stock, based on the experience and knowledge gained along the way. Listed below is a very basic guideline on how to identify a right stock.
1. It is all about the company
At the end of the day, an investor is betting on a company and not on the stock market as a whole. Hence, devote some time on studying the company. For example, Sri Lanka has recorded a 22.4% growth in tourist arrivals every year up to 2015 since 2009 and as a result, the Sri Lankan government has earmarked tourism as a fast growing sector and provided several concessions to the industry. Based on this development, an investor can easily presume that any company which is in the business of tourism (Hotels and Travels sector) is benefiting from this growth. But in the CSE, there are about 38 companies being listed under this sector and not all of these companies will perform well. Hence an investor would still have to analyze the company irrespective of the sector to pick the better stock to invest in.
2. Fundamentals
Using the same example as above, it is not practical to invest in all 38 counters just because the sector is poised to benefit. Thus, the starting point is to screen companies based on their respective financial statements (a company's financials can be freely downloaded from the CSE website). Various financial ratios can be calculated to understand how a company has performed over the years. In order to keep things simple, an investor can start off by calculating a few basic ratios and comparing it with industry ratios. Basic ratios can include, but are not limited to, revenue growth, earnings growth, gross profit margin, net profit margin, interest coverage and debt to capital ratio.
It is not always that a company can repeat its historical performance again and again. Therefore, an investor should be vigilant of any developing story on the respective industry and the company, in order to stay abreast with any new developments regarding the investment.
3. How much an investor pays for a stock will determine the return
An investor does not want to pay more than what a company deserves, that is its intrinsic (true) value. If the market price of a company is lower than its intrinsic value then it is considered to be an undervalued company and vice versa.
Relative based valuation is one of the three main methods used by analysts to derive intrinsic value for a company. The P/E ratio (calculated as the market price per share (MPS) divided by earnings per share (EPS)) is a good indicator to measure how much the investor community is willing to pay for one rupee of earnings of a company.
The usual belief is that the lower P/E stocks (in comparison to their peers and their respective industry) are a good buy. However, an investor should also note that if a company's P/E is trading at a discount for a longer period then investors may be purposefully paying a lower price for that company due to various negative reasons such as ineffective management, stagnant industry, declining sales, higher borrowing costs, etc.
4. Growth stocks
On the other hand, an investor may encounter a stock trading with a premium P/E ratio for a continuous period than its peers and/or industry. These types of stocks are classified as growth stocks as investors are willing to pay a higher price, keeping in mind the company's future earnings growth potential.
5. Dividend paying/ value stocks
Investing in stocks, unlike any other asset class, will give an investor a benefit from capital appreciation and dividend income (not all the counters listed in the CSE pay out dividend and they are not obliged to do so as well. It will be at the discretion of the management to decide upon the dividend). Hence, an investor can screen for a company with dividend paying history before investing, in order to ensure a periodic payment, while waiting to benefit from capital appreciation.
High dividend yield (Dividend Per share (DPS) / MPS) companies are often regarded as mature companies and they do not find any suitable investments to be made other than paying out for its investors. These types of stocks are known as Value Stocks.
How to be a successful investor
How an investor acts after investing is also as important as picking right portfolio of stocks;
1. Liquidate a stock that achieves the expected return
It is pivotal to determine an expected return before making the investment. The expected return can be based on various measures, but the more popular approach is to add a risk premium (an additional return expected for investing in the stock market) to the T-bill rate. For example, if the one year T-Bill is trading at 10%, an equity risk premium of 5.0% (this may vary depending on the investor's circumstances) can be added for an investor to arrive at an expected return of 15% from his investment over a period of time. Despite any lingering factors, an investor should liquidate a stock once his/her target return has been achieved.
2. Cut loss strategy
Getting out of a losing position at the right time is as important as selling the stock once it achieves the target return. An investor should do away any emotional attachment towards any stock and if prices have fallen below a certain percentage, he/she needs to liquidate the stocks. For example, if a particular stock has fallen by 10% then to recover and to realize profit, it has to rise by over 12%. Hence it is vital for an investor to determine his/her loss bearing percentage after finding the right stocks.
3. Review quarterly results of the stocks in the portfolio
All businesses are in an uncertain and a dynamic environment; which is why the investor community should always be vigilant about their investments. It is recommended that an investor should review quarterly financials published by a company (in a year, four quarterly financials will be released by a listed company) of every stock in their portfolio and if at all there is any major negative deviations in revenue and/or profit, an appropriate decision must be made after talking to their investment advisors.
4. Diversify your portfolio, but don't overdo it
Diversification (investing in different sectors) will act as a resistant of freefalling portfolio value. In the CSE, there are about 20 sectors. So it is important for an investor community to choose stocks from different sectors that will diversify their portfolio. For example, when interest rates are falling, stocks in consumer durables and real-estate are expected to perform well due to increased consumption levels, whereas banking stocks tend to be stagnant.
If an investor over diversifies, then effective management of his/her portfolio will be minimal. In theory, having 30 stocks in a portfolio will provide an investor with a high degree of diversification.

Raviraj murder case: aggrieved party requests court to re-list appeal
Filing a motion before the Court of Appeal, Sasikala Raviraj, wife of former TNA Parliamentarian Nadaraja Raviraj moved in the Court of Appeal that the appeal which was dismissed by the Court of Appeal last week be re-listed for support.
The appeal filed by Ravirajs wife challenging the Colombo High Courts judgement to release the five accused, including three Navy intelligence officers, in the Raviraj murder case was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on January 19.
When the application was taken up before the two-judge-Bench comprising Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Justice Lalith Jayasuriya neither the petitioner nor a lawyer representing the petitioner were present in Court.
The aggrieved party informed Court the document issued by the registry of High Court of Colombo was incomplete, with several critical documents ,including the order of the High Court Judge dated October 27, 2016 rejecting the objections of the aggrieved party to the matter being heard by a special jury and as such the aggrieved party is not in a position to seek a date of support of this application.
Therefore, the aggrieved party moved Court to be pleased to list this application for support for leave after the complete set of documents are made available them.
Furthermore, the aggrieved party moved that the Court be permitted the counsel for the aggrieved party to support this motion on January 24, 2017, January 25, 2017, or January 26, 2017.
The Court of Appeal had observed that the petitioner was not present in Court and unrepresented. Therefore, the Court decided to dismiss the appeal application.
Sasikala Raviraj filed this appeal seeking an order to set aside the verdict of the Colombo High Court dated December 23, 2016 to acquit and release all accused from the case.
On December 23, 2016, three Navy intelligence officers and two others, accused in the Raviraj murder, were acquitted and released from the case after they were found not guilty by jury trial.
The verdict which was delivered by High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke, as per the unanimous decision reached by the jury, following a month long trial. The jurys decision was that the accused cannot be convicted based on the evidence in the case.
The petitioner further sought an order to set aside the order of the High Court allowing the request of the accused for the case to be tried before a jury. The petitioner stated that a trial by jury cannot be accepted in this case since three charges out of five had been levelled under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).
The High Court allowed to proceed with the Raviraj murder trial in absentia of the three accused Palana Sami Suresh alias Sami, Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan and Fabian Royston Toussaint who were evading Court since the initiation of investigations.
The indictments were filed against six accused Palana Sami Suresh alias Sami, Prasad Chandana Kumara alias Sampath, Gamini Seneviratne, Pradeep Chaminda alias Vajira, Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan and Fabian Royston Toussaint on five counts, including committing the murder of Raviraj and his security officer Lokuwella Murage Laksman under the provisions of the PTA and Penal Code. Three accused who were not present before Court, had been identified as ex-LTTE cadres affiliated to the Karuna faction. Wijeya Wickrema Manamperige Sanjaya Preethi Viraj was made state witness in the Raviraj murder trial.

Resolve expatriate workers complaints soon: Thalatha
Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala has directed the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment to probe complaints received from Sri Lankan Expatriate workers expeditiously and ensure that justice is done to them without delay.
The Minister said Sri Lanka expatriate workers could minimise problems at the workplace if they registered with the SLBFE prior to their departure.
She said there had been a 43 percent reduction in complaints from expatriate workers in 2015 compared to the previous year.
A SLBFE release says the number of complaints received by the Bureaus mediation unit in 2015 was 10,505 while 2016, it was 6,156.
This was a 43 percent decrease when compared to the number in 2016.
In 2016, most of the complaints came from the Middle East countries. Of them, 3,411 were from Saudi Arabia while Kuwait, 915, Qatar 618, the UAE 507, Malaysia 201, Oman 282, and Jordan 106.
Most issues were related to the failure on the part of employers to offer the promised jobs and wages, breach of the service contract by the employer, harassment and injustice caused by outside parties.

Restoring equal rights and dignity in face of adversity
Friday, February 20, 2017, marked the eleventh annual United Nations' World Day of Social Justice, a day dedicated to advancing a world that promotes a peaceful and prosperous co-existence. It also encourages people to look at how social justice affects poverty eradication. It also focuses on the goal of achieving full employment and support for social integration.
In one of his most famous writings, "Letter from Birmingham Jail," Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said of injustice: "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly."
In other words, the very existence of injustice has implications for us all. As such, we each have a responsibility to actively challenge unjust power structures wherever they should surface.
There are many aspects to justice and the creation of a just world. These include social and economic factors as well as the principles of equity and equal rights. Yet social justice has been defined in a variety of ways. Among them, they incorporate concepts of basic rights, the realisation of human potential, social benefit, a healthy planet, an equitable distribution of resources, equal opportunities and obligations, security, and freedom from discrimination.
Active steps
Economic justice really forms a part of social justice. It seeks the equitable distribution of the world's natural and intellectual wealth so that everyone is able to gain a fair share. Social justice means equal rights for all, regardless of gender, race, class, ethnicity, citizenship, religion, age or sexual orientation. It implies equal rights for women and girls in workplaces, homes and public life.
It implies economic justice, which means governments must take active steps to alleviate poverty and redress past injustices. In a world where millions starve and minorities are discriminated against, such goals are still a long way off.
Governments have made a commitment to the creation of a framework for action that promotes social justice not only at national level, but internationally. In addition, Governments around the world have also pledged to promote equal distributions of income and resources and have recognised that a society for all needs to be based on respect for all human rights.
Across the world, there are thousands of examples of such injustice. It can take the form of repression, discrimination, harassment, or simply the failure to redress inequalities. Social justice means that the rights of all people in our community are considered in a fair and equitable manner. While equal opportunity targets everyone in the community, social justice targets the marginalised and disadvantaged groups of people in our society.
Work opportunities
Urgent action should be taken to increase the number of work opportunities in order to alleviate tensions. Policies need to focus more on strengthening employment and tackling the inequalities.
Furthermore, vulnerable employment is concerning high in developing economics with peaks in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Public policies should ensure that all people have equal access to health care services. People living in isolated communities should have the same access to clean water and sanitation as a person living in an urban area. People of a low socio-economic background should receive the same quality health services that a person in a higher socio-economic income receives.
Information designed to educate the community must be provided in languages that the community can understand. Many of the themes and agendas over the years have focused on child labour, which refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives them of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular school, and that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful.
Not all work done by children should be classified as child labour that is to be targeted for elimination. The participation of children or adolescents in work that does not affect their health and personal development or interfere with their schooling, is generally regarded as being something positive.
This includes activities such as helping their parents around the home, assisting in a family business or earning pocket money outside school hours and during school holidays. These kinds of activities contribute to children's development and to the welfare of their families.
Skills and experience
They provide them with skills and experience, and help to prepare them to be productive members of society during their adult life. The term 'child labour' is often defined as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development.
Forced labour in general takes different forms, including debt bondage, human trafficking and other forms of modern slavery.
The most vulnerable victims are women and girls forced into prostitution, migrants trapped in debt bondage and sweatshop or farm workers kept there by clearly illegal tactics and paid little or nothing.
No one can be blind to the reality that a generation of children have grown up hearing gunshots, dodging bullets and living in fear for their lives.
Many were forced to become adults before the age of 10, constrained to carry arms and fight in senseless wars they could not comprehend.
Several children dragooned into becoming child soldiers have been maimed, raped and impregnated by men they did not know, or threatened by men who had once sworn to protect them.
These children have suffered numerous atrocities and abuses they could not articulate. Many were forced to live in refugee camps, became victims of sex trafficking, or grew up without parents while suffering through the heartaches and pains of a country in turmoil.
These types of illegal exploitation and forced enslavement are horrendous crimes against humanity. It is time for all right-thinking citizens of the world to rise in one accord and call for a screeching end to such despotic criminality in all its reprehensible forms.

Resurgent Ramos sinks Malaga as Real increase lead at top
BARCELONA: Sergio Ramos made amends for his untimely own goal last week at Sevilla by scoring twice as Real Madrid bounced back from two successive defeats by beating Malaga 2-1 on Saturday to go four points clear at the top of La Liga.
The Real Madrid captain headed his side in front in the 35th minute by powering Toni Kroos's outswinging corner beyond Carlos Kameni and struck again in the 43rd by sliding in a free kick from his German team mate from close range to net his third goal in four games.
It was the perfect response from the Spain international six days after putting through his own net against Sevilla and inadvertently helping his former side win 2-1 to halt Zinedine Zidane's side's remarkable 40-game unbeaten run.
Ramos has now scored six league goals this term, bettering his previous record of five in a season with still half the campaign to go.
Malaga had proved difficult opponents and a slip by Raphael Varane allowed Venezuela international Juanpi to pull a goal back in the 63rd minute. It took a good save from Keylor Navas to prevent Chory Castro from levelling moments later.
Real lead the standings on 43 points, four clear of Sevilla and five ahead of champions Barcelona, having played 18 games. Barca visit Eibar on Sunday while Sevilla travel to Osasuna.
Real have a game in hand on their two closest rivals.
The most important thing is that we won the game and made a good start. We had chances but these days we need four opportunities to score one goal. It was difficult because our opponents pushed us hard. We're tired, but happy, Real coach Zidane told reporters.
Uruguayan Castro had hit the post for the visiting side and forced another impressive save from Navas in an action-packed first half in which Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema squandered clear chances for Real and their Brazil left back Marcelo limped off with a suspected hamstring injury.
Luka Modric was also taken off in the second half, potentially leaving Zidane with as many as six absentees for Wednesday's King's Cup quarter-final second leg at Celta Vigo, when his side need to overturn a 2-1 deficit to progress.
Luka had discomfort, Marcelo's problem is more serious. I'm quite worried by the injuries, it's put me in a bad mood, because we have a very important game on Wednesday, added Zidane.
Ronaldo's frustration grew after the break as he struck the post and was twice denied by Kameni, who almost committed an embarrassing error when he allowed a back pass to trickle through his legs but managed to scramble it away before it crossed the line.
Valencia continued their mini-revival under caretaker coach Salvador Gonzalo Voro by winning 2-0 at sixth-placed Villarreal in a local derby to move seven points clear of the relegation zone.
Carlos Soler, 20, scored his first goal for the club by turning in a pass from former Manchester United winger Nani in the 35th minute and striker Santi Mina robbed goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo to tap in the second in the 42nd.
Voro is the third man to take charge of Valencia this season following the sacking of Pako Ayesteran and the resignation of former Italy manager Cesare Prandelli and he has more wins than his predecessors this season, the derby victory following last week's 2-1 victory over Espanyol.
Voro also won two games as caretaker coach following the sacking of Ayesteran and will remain in the post until the end of the campaign.Valencia are provisionally 15th in the standings.
Espanyol beat struggling Granada 3-1 to climb to 10th place, while Leganes, who occupy the final spot above the relegation zone, twice came from behind to draw 2-2 at Alaves.

Rigid Tyre plant work as planned - Minister
Minister Plantation Industries, Naveen Dissanayake said the proposed multi-million dollar Rigid Tyre plant at Horana work is going ahead as planned.
There was no truth in claims that the project was on hold due to directive from the Presidential Secretariat. They are baseless, he said.
The project would not only bring in US$ 75 million but it would bring in technology to Sri Lanka and create over 2,500 jobs. More importantly it would give the message that Sri Lanka is open for international investors,he said.
The investor of this venture is Nandana Lokuwithana, Chairman of Ceylon Steel Corporation and its member company MA Steel Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd. He is also chairman of Onyx Group in the UAE with a host of diverse companies,one of which is a steel fabrication company. He is also the owner of Marriot Al Jadaf Hotel, Dubai.
The minister also said that the project is not an investment to dump black money as the funding is originating from a reputed bank in United Arab Emirates.Reverting to funding origins, he said a recognized Bank in Dubai sourced by the project investor would ensure its effective completion on schedule.There is no question of black money,he said.
Minister Dissanayake also said that local rubber sector too would get a boost since they can get higher prices for rubber from the Rigid Tyre plant at Horana .

Sea seized
Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage joined the Sri Lanka Navy as an officer cadet in 1978. Over the years, he held various sea, land, and amphibious commands, and became Commander of the Navy in 2012. He retired from the Navy in 2014, and worked to attain a PhD in Philosophy from Sir John Kotelawala Defence University. He is the first and so far only person to attain a PhD from that university.
The result of his academic struggle is his PhD thesis, entitled Asymmetric Warfare at Sea: The Case of Sri Lanka, which was recently published by Lambert Press and is available in Vijitha Yapa book shops throughout Colombo.
The following is an interview about his book and on his views on the complicated nature of the maritime aspect of the civil conflict.
Q: Just to begin, for people who arent so aware of the subject matter, can you go over what you mean by asymmetric warfare in the naval context
Admiral
Dr. Jayanath Colombage
A: The normal meaning of asymmetric is the disparity between forces. In the Sri Lankan context, we had a battle between the Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) and the Sea Tigers. Now, the SLN was a big organisation with harbours, ships, lots of manpower, and structured training. Whereas the LTTE Sea Tigers were quite a small organisation. They did not have any sheltered harbours, they did not have any big ships. They had small boats and few machine guns. So, there was a huge asymmetry between the forces of the SLN and the LTTE, for which I will use the term Sea Tigers. Asymmetries were seen in the force structure, the equipment, the platforms (ships). Now, in order for the weaker force, the Sea Tigers in this matter, for them to become equal, or to defeat the SLN, they had to use various asymmetric tactics. Now, they used these tactics at sea. In normal guerilla warfare, guerillas are normally a smaller organisation, so they adopt guerilla tactics to fight with a conventional army. Similarly, the Sea Tigers used these asymmetric tactics at sea to match the power of the SLN.
Q: Can you further explain what exactly those asymmetric capabilities of the Sea Tigers What made them so difficult to deal with
A: The first thing is they only had small boats and they did not have sheltered harbours or big ships. They developed certain asymmetric tactics. One thing is the suicide boat. These became the most potent weapon that was in the Sea Tiger arsenal. I would compare suicide boats to anti-ship missiles with a human brain. This was very effective. Then, another tactic they developed was swarming. This was developed by the Sea Tigers, and the main idea was to always guarantee numerical superiority at sea, and to concentrate overwhelming firepower. For example, when the SLN had one or two naval boats patrolling, they would deploy about twenty boats that would come at you.
Out of this twenty, they would have three or four suicide boats. It was difficult to differentiate the attack crafts from the suicide boats. About 20 boats concentrating their firepower on one target is dangerous, and it improved their chances of success. There were times when we lost a number of platforms due to swarming tactics.
There were times when we had to withdraw from battles because of their overwhelming numerical superiority and concentrated firepower coming from multiple directions and aimed at a bigger target. They would encircle the SLN ships. The Sea Tigers also pioneered the use of underwater suicide saboteurs. Divers would carry a pack of explosives, maybe 50 kilos. He would swim a long distance to where the SLN ships were, and once he was underneath the ship, he would hang onto it and explode himself.
Yet another development was the improvised underwater explosive devices. The most famous example of this is the limpet mine, which had a magnet that could attach it to the hull of a ship and be detonated remotely. They also did not keep their boats in the water. We would expect the boats to be in the water, but after launching an attack, they would withdraw the boats onto land. Another one was to take cover in the fishing boat clusters to avoid detection.
Though limpet mines were used during World War Two, they were not used in similar contexts. These capabilities were pioneered by the LTTE. No other terrorist organisation in the world has done any of the things that I just mentioned. Al Qaida conducted a suicide boat mission once on the USS Cole.
Q: Can you talk a little about the coordination capabilities of the LTTE You focus on how they were better coordinated at the beginning of the conflict than the SLN.
A: They were one organisation with one commander who had a grand vision and objective to have a separate state. They also understood the importance of maritime strategy as a key component of their grand strategy, whereas I think Sri Lanka, unfortunately, did not give that much emphasis to the maritime strategy. So they understood the maritime strategy, which was part of their overall strategy. They also had a recruiting advantage because many of the LTTE cadres came from fishing communities. These fishermen were born there and knew the sea very well. The navy, on the other hand, the majority of naval guys came from the interior of the country where they were not exposed to life at sea until they joined the navy. When you know the sea, its always easier to coordinate. They also selected the best leaders to head the Sea Tiger Unit, and there was continuous coordination of the whole unit because Prabhakaran gave prominence to the Sea Tigers. He understood the importance of the Sea Tigers to his overall strategy. The coordination, organisation, and propagation of the Sea Tigers were far better than those of the SLN.
Q: What were the organisational drawbacks of the SLN that allowed the Sea Tigers to gain an advantage
A: If you look at organisational drawbacks, you have to look at three separate categories: on the policy level, the strategic level and the tactical level. When you talk about the policy drawbacks, I have to say that policy derives from the government. The Navy is an instrument of politics. You have to derive the policy from the government. I believe that there was a clear lack of policy coming from successive governments towards the Navy that made it difficult to develop, empower, and enhance the Navy. Being an island nation, we should have given priority to the Navy.
Q: Are you talking about enhancing naval equipment or expertise
A: Everything, including ships, manpower, training, equipment. These are policy level drawbacks. Leadership was also an issue in government and SLN. Throughout the war, there were many governments and many naval commanders.
There was no continuation because the policy was not continuous. There was no grand strategy incorporating maritime strategy in a substantial manner. Whereas Prabhakaran had a grand strategy to develop his small navy to achieve Eelam. On the other side, we had mostly ad hoc strategies. The governments would focus on developing strategies for the time that they were in power, usually between four and six years. These strategies were shortsighted. That is not the best way to go about winning a sustained fight.
Because there was no strategy, nobody had the courage to develop the SLN in a substantial manner. Mostly, the development of the SLN was reactive. When the Sea Tigers would do something or improve their capacity, we would try to come up with a solution. When they increased their speed, we increased our speed. When they acquired more guns, we did the same. The initiative was with the LTTE. They were calling the shots. Then another major organisational drawback was our lack of proper intelligence.
We were dependent on other sources for intelligence. The police, army, and air force all had their own intelligence apparatuses, but maritime intelligence is different. Not everybody can understand the ocean. In the maritime intelligence domain, we were quite low. We really did not know what was happening around our coast until they came and hit us.
We also did not use highly advanced technology and equipment, like sensors and automatic fire control systems. We were quite happy with what we had, and we never thought of making a quantum leap to acquire better technology. This hampered our early efforts. The intelligence community matured and began working together for a common purpose. After 2005, there was one chief of national intelligence, and all the agencies reported to him. This allowed us to acquire actionable, precise intelligence.
I also have to say that we underestimated the enemy quite a bit. We thought the Sea Tigers were a small organisation that could not become a threat to the country. We thought they would not be able to succeed in their overall mission. This goes along with, not understanding the potential of the asymmetric maritime threats. The SLN was raised, trained, and developed as a conventional navy.
You are trained to fight another conventional navy which has ships and guns. Now here we had a totally different enemy. He was an unconventional enemy. We did not understand the potential of these asymmetric capabilities.
Q: What was that maritime strategy
A: All this time, we were underestimating the enemy. We were saying, no, the enemy does not bring their supplies from the sea. We said they took their weapons from the Sri Lankan military. But we realized one key piece of sustenance for the LTTE was their logistics network. A major development for the SLN was the enhancement of maritime intelligence, and this took place in 2005.
When we developed our intelligence, we came to know a lot about the LTTEs logistics network. That network had three components: raising money, purchasing weapons, and transporting goods and people. The SLN could not do much about their money or purchasing weapons. The only thing we could do was look after the ships. The LTTE used to stockpile their ships in Indonesia and other parts of the ASEAN region.
Then, the ships would come about 200 nautical miles from the coast of Sri Lanka, and then they would use small boats to transfer the weapons to the country. Until about 2005, we were trying to prevent these small boats from landing the weapons. When we apprehended one small boat, another ten would get through.
So we realized that this strategy was not going to work. We wanted to attack the logistic network at sea, and that meant going after the warehouse ships. This was a major strategic development. And then, when we started attacking their logistic network within the exclusive economic zone of Sri Lanka, the LTTE moved further from the coast. The navy focused on following them further away. That was a major game changer. In September and October of 2007, the SLN went all the way to the edge of Australian territory, and we destroyed all four of the LTTE ships.
Then, the LTTE was very good at fighting in the coastal areas. They had a large number of boats, and they built these boats by themselves. They would bring the outboard motor from elsewhere, and then they would use these small boats with their weapons to carry out many attacks. The SLN realized that our fast attack crafts were not the best platforms on which to fight the small boats.
We presented a bigger target with our large boats. The Sea Tigers were basically wave riding because they were in small boats. It was very difficult for us to detect and engage the Sea Tigers, but it was very easy for them to see a bigger target and just fire. After 2005, we became brave enough to employ the same tactics to attack the LTTE, and we started using small boats. We began building the same types of boats the LTTE had. The LTTE had proven hull designs.
We knew how good they were. There were two types of boats that they used, one we called the inshore patrol craft (IPC), and the other one was the arrow boat, which was a small fiber glass dinghy fitted with high-powered outboard motors and a number of guns. We built both of these crafts in our own shipyards. We were able to build them at a much faster rate, much cheaper rate, and the boats were of a higher quality.
As I said, one of the Sea Tigers asymmetric tactics was to deploy large numbers of boats to attack our boats. Now, when the LTTE launched ten boats to attack our large boats, we would launch 40 boats. We regained the numerical superiority. That confused the LTTE, because our big ships would withdraw and then forty boats would attack them. Now we both are on an equal level.
We carried 23 millimeter guns on these small boats, and the LTTE had the same calibre. In the small boats there were four people, and in the slightly larger boats there were between six and eight people. Until this time, the SLN and Sea Tigers would alternate victories in sea battles, and the overall fight would go on. After 2006, when we changed our strategy, they stopped coming to sea to fight. By about 2009, the fighting at sea became almost zero.
Another tactic we used after 2005 was to deploy better harbour defences. Before 2005, the LTTE was very clever in attacking our harbours. They attacked Trincomalee Harbour, Kankesanthurai Harbour and the Port of Galle. There were a few attempts on the port of Colombo. We felt that we were quite safe in the harbour, and we had various systems to protect the harbour, but they would creep in and plant an explosive and go.
Now, we realized with the LTTE, once they launch an attack, it is very difficult to stop it, because usually they would come in a suicide mission with one way communication. We realized that if we wanted to defend the harbours, we could not do it by staying inside the harbour. In order to protect the Colombo harbour, we started dominating the coastal areas, sometimes up to 30 kilometres on either side of the harbour. So, for example, we dominated the coast up to Negombo, and every hundred metres there was a sailor. And similarly, we dominated the coast down to Panadura in the south.
We also monitored the fishing: who goes out, who comes in, how many are outboard motors, whether they are carrying anything illegal. We prevented the LTTE from launching an attack, and that was a success for defending the harbours. This was all part of the grand strategy.
Another issue was that we had, up until 2005, depended a lot on foreign suppliers to give us ships, weapons, systems, everything. We did not do much research and development work. We then remedied this and experimented with electronics, with communication, with gun mounts, with guns, with fire control systems. These were serious innovations.
Q: Can you discuss the advent of underwater defenses
A: We had a situation where the LTTE underwater saboteurs were targeting the ships in the harbour. And then we conducted many experiments aimed at preventing this. We even looked at using a measured pioneered during World War Two called the boom defense. That is to have a boom, and a net underneath to prevent divers from crossing. We had a few layers at times. We developed a system called throwing scare charges into the sea. Sound travels in water much faster than light or electromagnetic waves, so when you create an explosion underwater sound travels much faster. If there is a driver who hears an explosion, his eardrums would burst, and then he would get disoriented. We had sonars and fish finders, but we could not totally depend on these electronic systems, so we needed to take these proactive these measures.
Q: What about changes within the SLN itself
A: There is no doubt that the leadership of the SLN improved. We had a political leadership and military leadership, but they did not filter down. Promotions and appointments in the SLN were given on seniority alone. Once you acquire a particular seniority at the early stages of your career, you carry it forward. Theres no threat from anyone else. We decided that we had to start considering merit, performance, and not only seniority when promoting officers and giving appointments and then rewarding them. That gave an opportunity for the real battle leadership to emerge. Seniority was based on academic work but not really performance in battle. Should that carry so much importance 30 years later No it should not.
That gave an opportunity for some very good officers who were extra brave. That produced results. Something else I want to mention is the increased synergy between the political and the military leadership. At first, the political leadership tried to take credit for everything. Some military leadership would try to take credit for himself or for his organisation. But we had a situation that allowed for more synergy between the military and the government. People were not worried about taking credit. It was a combined effort.

Sri Lanka river paddle boarder faced crocodile threat
A paddle boarder faced man-eating crocodiles during his quest to travel from source to sea along the longest river in Sri Lanka.
Kev Brady from Gloucester said he was terrified as he paddled more than 320 km along the Mahaweli.
He now aims to paddle 1,300s km around the coast of the island.
His previous feats include canoeing along the Mississippi and swimming the length of the River Severn.
Brady said he had suffered minor scratches and scrapes during the journey, but the most "frightening" thing was having to paddle past the crocodiles. "I was on my own and standing [on the paddle board] only two in or three in above the water.
I saw a two-foot long head pop up only five m away from me.
These are saltwater crocodiles that can grow up to six m long and are considered man eaters.
I was terrified." Brady said he felt relieved to have finished the river challenge. "I was anxious and afraid most of the day and night, in between appreciating how beautiful and amazing it was.

Start time record broken as Grigor Dimitrov defeats Richard Gasquet
While most people are up and about this Sunday morning, Bulgarian 15th seed Grigor Dimitrov will hopefully be asleep, and for good reason.Dimitrov's straight-sets win over Frenchman Richard Gasquet, the 18th seed, began at 11..58pm, the latest start to a match in Australian Open history.
While the three-setter wasn't the latest finish, a delayed night session, owing to Rafael Nadal's epic five-set encounter with German youngster Alexander Sascha Zverev, meant both night matches were delayed.
After Australian Daria Dasha Gavrilova took three sets to dispatch Switzerland's Timea Bacsinzky, in two and a half hours, Dimitrov and Gasquet were kept in the wings until well past 11.30pm.
While many in the crowd at Rod Laver Arena left before the end of the match, some fans stayed until the eventual 2am finish, slugging it out with the players.But while the spectators were, assumedly, straight home to bed, the victor, Dimitrov, still had some work to do.
Hopefully by five I'm going to be done with everything, all the stretchings, the rehab, just sleep in, come back tomorrow, hit some balls. Kind of go to bed again, he said in his post-match press conference.
Dimitrov, a former world No. 8, has set up a thrilling fourth-round showdown with Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin, who beat both defending champion Novak Djokovic and Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta in five-set matches to progress to the fourth round.
He said he would not request a later start time on Monday owing to his late match against Gasquet.I'm not one of those guys that go, 'Can you please play me at 1am in the morning,' whatever.
Whatever time. I really don't care. I wouldn't think they're going to put us early to play anyway, he said.While over the years there has been some talk about a match curfew at the Australian Open, Dimitrov said it's just part of the game.We had matches in the past finishing four, five in the morning. It's in the game. Whatever it is, it's in the game. I just had to deal with whatever was in front of me, he said.
The latest match ever played at the Australian Open, or any grand slam, was in 2008, between Australian Lleyton Hewitt and Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis, a five-set match that finished at 4.33am.Dimitrov revealed he had been spending some time away from Melbourne Park visiting video game arcades to wind down.
It's important to kind of disconnect a little bit, just hang out with friends, walk around, do whatever you feel like doing.
I think it's very important for the mind and the body to be synchronised with you. If you feel that you're in one element, it always feels good to be on the court warming up, you feel loose, happy, he said.

Stokes dominates as England beat India in 3rd ODI
Kolkata: England all-rounder Ben Stokes put in a dominant performance with the bat and ball to help England pull off a five-run consolation win against India in the third one-day international in Kolkata on Sunday.
Seam bowler Stokes claimed three wickets to help restrict India, who were chasing 322 for victory, to 316-9 as Kedar Jadhav's 90 went in vain.
Chris Woakes, who bowled the final over with India needing 16 to win, held his nerve to give England their first victory on the tour.
Earlier Stokes hit an unbeaten 39-ball 57 to help England post 321-8 after being put into bat at Kolkata's Eden Gardens.
India lost their openers early in the chase but Kohli (55) and Yuvraj Singh (45) put on 65 runs for the third wicket to rebuild the innings.
Kohli, who was dropped on 35, failed to capitalise on the reprieve after losing his wicket to Stokes. He was caught behind chasing a wide delivery outside the off stump.
With Yuvraj (45), fresh from his match-winning 150 in Cuttack, and former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (25) also back in the pavilion, India slipped to 173-5.
First match hero Jadhav, who hit a brilliant 120 in India's opening win in Pune, and Hardik Pandya (56) then put on 104 runs to revive the chase. The batting duo took the opposition attack by surprise with their powerful hitting as they struck 16 fours and three sixes between them. AFP

Super vet gives up life in UK to care for Sri Lankan street dogs
A supervet who gave up life in the UK to rescue street dogs in Sri Lanka has saved 5,000 animals.
Janey Lowes, 28, helps dogs with problems ranging from mange and ticks to rabies and machete wounds.
She said: So many are in such a bad way, Im amazed theyre alive. I am in surgery every day but a lot of it is also about showing them compassion. I feel these are all my dogs and I have a responsibility to them.
Many have been injured in traffic accidents and need amputations, while others have been attacked by locals with knives or had boiling water thrown over them, as they are viewed as vermin. Janey, whose story shown on BBCs Inside Out tomorrow, said: Dogs here are not seen the way they are back home.
"Even when they are owned, the majority are used as guard dogs, tied up on a chain in the heat or kept in a crate 23hours of the day. So on top of treating dogs, we are aiming to educate people.
Janey, of Bishop Auckland, Co Durham, is also trying to curb the number of unwanted puppies, as 60 percent die before they are fully grown. Her neutering programme has made a big difference.
When she arrived, 40 percent of dogs in the area were bald with mange. This is now below five pe cent. Most days, she jumps in a tuktuk and tours around looking for dogs. It is a 24-hour job and she sees animals seven days a week.
Janey, who won Vet of the Year at last years Daily Mirrors Animal Hero Awards, moved in 2014 after a backpacking trip. She said: Im well-travelled and have seen lots of street dogs but Sri Lanka was another level. I couldnt walk away.
She set up a practice in an empty school and now has 20 staff members. They rely entirely on charity donations.
She has taken in five dogs herself, including two-week-old Ralphie, who was the only surviving pup in his litter and had a head wound filled with maggots.
She said: I trained as a vet as I want to help animals. Here I wake every day knowing Ill do something worthwhile.

## Title: A synopsis of disposal of death in Sri Lanka

A synopsis of disposal of death in Sri Lanka
A body could be disposed lawfully or unlawfully. The unlawful disposal of a body or bodies is also termed surreptitious disposal which is often resorted to when a need arises to conceal a secret homicide.
Measures such as throwing in to a waterway, secret burial, cremation, dismemberment, abandoning in a jungle, fabricating an accident or a suicide are employed in this venture.
Surreptitious disposal could also occur during periods of civil unrest where multiple bodies could be disposed of in tire-pyres or buried in mass-graves following extra-judicial execution.
The aim of this article is to provide the reader with a brief overview of the steps taken in the legal/lawful disposal of bodies.
A body could be legally disposed by burial, cremation, entombment or donation to a scientific institution such as a medical school. Yet, this is the final step of the disposal. There are a series of events that should follow prior to this final stage.
People most often die in hospitals now. When a person dies in a ward, the intern medical officer is entitled to certify that the person is dead. In medicine, we speak of three different types of death ie: molecular death, somatic death and brain death. Brain death could also be further divided into several sub-types.
In day to day clinical practice in the normal ward settings, we satisfy ourselves by resorting in to the diagnosis of somatic death when pronouncing the death of a patient though the diagnosis of brain death could be mandatory in certain complicated situations such as in switching off of life-support systems, organ harvesting/cadaveric donations etc.
In the diagnosis of somatic death, the house officer may carry out certain simple clinical tests/examinations and conclude the absence of audible heart sounds, absence of palpable central pulse, absence of spontaneous breathing and spontaneous beating of the heart, absence of pupillary light reflex in the eyes, areflexia, hypotonia and absence of motor response to adequate painful stimuli.
Once the death is confirmed, the house officer should document the same on the bead head ticket (BHT) with the date, time, his name and designation and then place his signature underneath. The time documented on the BHT is considered as the time of death.
The body should then be kept in the ward for around two hours before sending to the morgue. If there is slightest suspicion as to whether the person is actually dead, the house officer could re-examine the body at the end of two hours prior to sending the body to the mortuary or ask a senior colleague for assistance and opinion.
After sending the body to the mortuary, the house officer should take a very important medico-legal decision ie: whether this death needs an inquest or not.
Let us later discuss the indications for an inquest and their legal provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code. If the house officer decides that this death does not need an inquest, then he is entitled to fill the Declaration of Death Form and hand it over to the legal claimant of the body.
The legal claimant of the body can then register the death with the Births and Deaths Registrar of the area who will issue either the Death Certificate or a temporary cover note.
This document issued by the registrar is essential to take the body out of the hospital mortuary, to hand over the body to the funeral directors (or to a medical faculty), for making arrangements at the cemetery and for obituary notifications through newspapers and other media. Such a body could be disposed of in any manner such as burial, cremation, entombment or donation without restrictions. On the other hand, if the house officer decides that the death needs an inquest (a preliminary, fact-finding judicial inquiry by the magistrate or the inquirer into sudden deaths - ISD), then he should not fill the declaration of death form.
Instead, he has to request an inquest on the BHT from the hospital police post and the administrative head of the hospital. An inquest will be conducted either by the magistrate or the ISD depending on the type of the death.
At the end of the inquest, if the magistrate or the inquirer is satisfied with his findings that no foul-play had happened, then he will issue the Inquirers Certificate of Death to the legal claimant of the body.
He can use this instrument for the same purpose as the declaration of death for the disposal of the corpse. If, at the end of the inquest, the ISD or the magistrate feels that the death needs to be further scientifically investigated in to, to exclude foul-play, then he will temporarily with-hold issuing the Inquirers Certificate of Death and call upon a medical officer (nowadays usually a Judicial Medical Officer-JMO) to perform a Judicial/Medico-legalPost Mortem Examination (Autopsy) on the body.
This essentially consists of opening up of all body cavities, taking all organs out and dissecting them. A judicial autopsy also includes obtaining history of the deceased, scene visit, identification, preliminary procedures such as photography, video-taping and X-raying the body, examination of the clothing, external examination, internal examination, investigations (such as histopathology, toxicology, bio-chemistry, microbiology, DNA, anthropology, odontology etc), documentation and reporting.
At the end of the post-mortem examination, if the JMO is satisfied as to the cause of death and other prospective medico-legal issues, then he will submit the Certificate of Medical Cause of Death not to the legal claimants of the body but to the magistrate or the ISD who has called upon the doctor to carry out the autopsy.
Depending on this certificate, the ISD or the magistrate may issue his Inquirers Certificate of Death. If the doctor is confronted with medico-legal issues which need further investigations during the autopsy, the doctor will not issue the certificate of medical cause of death at the end of the post-mortem examination.
Instead, he will convey the ISD or the magistrate that this death is Under Investigation. At that point, the ISD or the magistrate will proclaim an Open Verdict regarding the death and allow the body to be only buried reserving the provision to disinter if need arises at a later date.
When the death is under investigation at the autopsy, the doctor will obtain routine tissue samples from all organs (mainly the suspicious organs) and injuries for histopathology, samples for toxicology and upon the discretion of the doctor for other investigations such as microbiology, bio-chemistry etc.
Once the results of these lab tests are available, the doctor will in most occasions be able to give a proper cause of death which he will inform the magistrate or the ISD. Then, the magistrate or the ISD will revert his initial open verdict and issue the proper inquirers certificate of death. Even when the doctor issues a certificate of medical cause of death, the magistrate or the ISD is empowered to proclaim an open verdict if he believes that there are other issues (not related to forensic medicine) around the death.
Let us briefly discuss the law related to the disposal of death in Sri Lanka. These are dealt with in sections 9, 369-373 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act (No. 15 of 1979). Section 9 empowers a magistrate to inquire into certain types of deaths occurring in his jurisdiction. The types of deaths included here are deaths in prisons, mental or leprosy hospitals, deaths due to violence, accidents, sudden deaths and where the cause and manner of death are uncertain. Section 369 restricts the conduct of an inquest to the provisions given by the Criminal Procedure Code.
Section 370 describes the procedure to be adopted by the ISD in conducting an inquest and further describes the judicial powers vested upon the ISD. It also lists the types of deaths warranting an inquest as; deaths due to suicide, killed by an animal, machinery or accident and deaths due to unknown causes.
Section 371 exclusively empowers a magistrate to hold an inquest into a custody death. Section 372 deals with recording of evidence at the inquest and the discretion the magistrate or the ISD has, to hold an inquest either in a public forum or as a private forum excluding the public from viewing and participating in the inquest on special grounds of public policy or expediency.
Section 373 deals with the powers the magistrate or the ISD has, to call upon a medical officer to conduct a judicial post-mortem examination and the power the magistrate alone (not the ISD) has to disinter an already buried body for the purpose of a post-mortem examination.
In every science and art in the world the principles and the practice may not be the same though in the ideal situation there should be no gap between the two. The same applies to law and medicine. The practice related to requesting an inquest by doctors is a rare example which goes beyond the principles.
In other words, in day to day practice in hospital settings the doctors do not strictly confine themselves to the indications listed in sections 9 and 370 of the Criminal Procedure Code when requesting an inquest.
The following deaths in hospitals are subjected to an inquest: deaths where the cause of death is unknown, all unnatural deaths (accidents, suicides and homicides) even when the cause of death is known, deaths due to suspicious circumstances, deaths due to criminal circumstances, deaths due to animals, deaths due to machinery, deaths due to tetanus, deaths due to rabies, deaths in custody, maternal deaths, deaths where there is a potential for an allegation of medical negligence.
This practice is adopted to ensure maximum justice to the deceased, his kith and kin as well as to the society and to be optimally transparent in provision of medical care and services.
A death in a hospital ward may fulfill one or more than one of the above criteria to warrant an inquest. If a death does not come under any one of the above criteria, in that case an inquest is not necessary and should not be requested since it serves no purpose and only harasses already bereaved and disturbed relatives.
For example there is a perpetuating practice among the medical staff in the majority of the wards in Sri Lanka to request an inquest merely when the death has taken place within the first 24 hours of admission even when it does not fulfill any one of the above criteria.
This practice had been abolished by a departmental circular several decades ago though it never seems to fully wither away! A natural death where the cause of death is known and where there is no suspicion or allegation of medical negligence could be released from the ward by filling the declaration of death form by the house officer and handing it over to the legal claimant of the body, irrespective of the period of stay in the hospital.
Let us discuss some practical situations encountered in the wards to have a better insight into the indications of an inquest.
 A 75-year-old diagnosed patient of ischaemic heart disease, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, with one previous episode of myocardial infarction is admitted with a classical retrosternal chest pain radiating along the left arm, sweating and faintishness. His ECG done in the ward following admission was conclusive of an acute coronary event in the background of previous ischaemic episodes.
Troponin I was significantly elevated and cardiac enzymes were positive. He was managed as for an acute heart attack with best available resources in the ward. The patient developed acute left heart failure despite treatment which is a common occurrence in massive heart attacks and died within 14 hours of admission. The cause of death is known and natural. The relatives are impressed with the effort of the medical staff to save the life of their loved one. In this situation the house officer can release the body by compiling the declaration of death form. There is no indication whatsoever for an inquest. The mythical concept of 24 hour time barrier should be boldly abandoned.
 The same patient was admitted to the OPD and the medical officer on duty pronounced death on admission. In this case, an inquest is a must despite the very convincing medical history. It is prudent to consider all deaths on admission as suspicious deaths and as deaths where the cause of death is unknown.
 A young male motorcyclist sustained gross pelvic fractures and spinal injuries following a road traffic accident. He was admitted to the orthopaedic unit and was surgically intervened. As a result of prolonged bed riddenness, he developed bed sores and despite vigorous treatment succumbed to death following septicaemia and multi-organ failure during the third month of admission to hospital. Despite the prolonged hospital stay, this death needs an inquest as the original cause leading to the hospital admission is unnatural (ie: an accident) and as there is always a potential risk of an allegation against the medical staff.
 A detainee from the then Bogambara Prisons was admitted to a medical ward in the Teaching Hospital Kandy with fever, shortness of breath and other classical features of lower respiratory tract infection. With relevant blood investigations and x-rays he was diagnosed of having left sided lower lobar pneumonia. He was treated adequately. Yet, on the fifth day he developed type ii respiratory failure and died. There was no allegation of medical mismanagement and the cause of death is known and natural. Still the prudent house officer of the ward has correctly requested an inquest as this death should be considered as a death in custody. For a death to be considered as a custody death the doctors should consider the broadest possible meaning of the term custody. One should not necessarily die under the roof of custody for it to be called a death in custody. The immediate period of time before arrest, after arrest, stay in the place of custody, transportation from one place of custody to another etc. should be taken in to consideration. Further, it should be understood that one could be kept in lawful as well as in unlawful custody.
If a suspect is retained in the police cell for prolonged periods without being produced before a magistrate, the initial lawful custody automatically becomes an unlawful custody with the passage of prescribed time interval. If a person is detained lawfully or unlawfully at any place without or against the free will of that individual, it automatically becomes custody. When a person is deprived of his freedom of movement and retained in custody, a heavy duty regarding the well being of that individual automatically befalls on the shoulders of the state. One aspect of delivering this duty is to conduct an inquest on all custody deaths in their widest meaning, to ensure that no foul-play has taken place. Coming back to the prisoner at Bogambara Prisons who died at Kandy Teaching Hospital, his pneumonia could have been resultant of a lung contusion (which could act as a focus of infection) which occurred due to a dented rib following an attack by a rival gang of inmates or a jailor in the prisons which took place several days prior to hospital admission. The fractured rib was missed in the postero-anterior view of the chest x-ray taken to best visualise the lung fields and later discovered only during the post mortem examination subsequent to the magisterial inquest.

 A married woman employed in a Middle East country (whose husband was in another country) became pregnant out of wedlock and used an abortifacientpessary few days prior to returning to Sri Lanka without the knowledge of the husband. She has secretly delivered the baby possibly without medical care or aborted the foetus without anybody elses knowledge with large parts of retained products of conception (placenta and membranes) still within the uterus. She became severely ill and consulted a specialist VOG in private sector.
The consultant, in bona fide intention of saving the life of the woman, had admitted her to a private nursing home and carried out a surgery to evacuate the retained products of conception. She was then admitted to the ICU of the same private hospital where her condition continued to deteriorate. As she was financially unstable to go for another major operation in the private sector, the VOG transferred her to the local base hospital where he was in charge of the gynaecology ward. With the help of the specialist General Surgeon of the same base hospital the VOG opened her up for the second time to find features of septicaemia and multi-organ failure. Both specialists have done their best to save the life of the woman though she died in the ICU of the base hospital two days following the second surgery. The medical officer in charge of the ICU had requested an inquest for the death. The inquirer into sudden deaths (ISD) assigned for the base hospital called upon the medico-legal medical officer of the same hospital to carry out the judicial autopsy. The medical officer who possessed no post-graduate exposure in Forensic Medicine or any special training or experience to handle a complicated case of this calibre prudently declined to do the post-mortem and advised the police sergeant who was at the verge of his retirement to go back to the ISD and get a new order addressing the Consultant Judicial Medical Officer in the nearest Teaching (tertiary care) Hospital. The police sergeant instead of going back to the ISD, altered the original letter addressed to the medical officer of the base hospital with Tipex and approached the Consultant Judicial Medical Officer who was in charge of the post-mortems on that day at the teaching hospital.
The police officer, the sister and the brother-in-law of the deceased adamantly said that there is no doubt what so ever from their side and that they are not worried about the surgical management. They also said that they are in a real hurry to cremate the body.
In the mean time the much disturbed VOG personally contacted the consultant JMO and expressed his concerns. The consultant JMO considered the following facts: The husband of the deceased who is the legal claimant of the body was unaware of the death and was not in the country. The deceased had seemingly undergone a criminal abortion (perhaps with the possibility of infanticide as well).
Two consultant medical specialists and one private nursing home and one government hospital are involved with the scenario (though both specialists have acted in good faith for the best interest of the patient, later on their could be allegations of medical negligence from third parties-therefore exonerating the two specialists becomes a need in this case).
The cause of death is not known and much complicated with the theory of causation creeping into the picture. Obviously the circumstances are suspicious and possibly have some criminal elements too.
Furthermore, there was no proper order from the ISD of the local hospital except for a forged document altered by the police officer with his own hand writing which was obviously different to the original hand writing of the ISD on the rest of the order. The consultant JMO who had almost two decades of exposure in forensic practice was well aware of the witchcraft and black-magic often practiced by certain categories of officers involved with death investigation for pecuniary gain and he sensed the same through his gut feeling in this instance too.
Cumulatively this was no other than an attempt to hide a secret crime. In such situations the standard practice among the Forensic Specialists in Sri Lanka is to advice the police officer to inform the same to the magistrate of the area and obtain a magisterial order for the inquest.
This is not written law but the standard practice developed for years beyond the memory of the oldest man alive, to help the criminal justice system to overcome problems created due to corruption among some police officers and inquirers. Requesting the police to obtain a magisterial order is by no way an insult to the judicial powers vested upon the ISDby section 370 of the CPC but merely an SOS signal to the Magistrate that some irremediable mischief is likely to occur if he does not take over the inquest! In this case, the police sergeant instead of explaining the situation to the magistrate; has apparently misinformed him that the consultant JMO has blatantly refused to conduct a post-mortem examination.
Though the magistrate was one with inviolate and immaculate professional integrity and remarkable knowledge of principles of law, at this point he was surprisingly gullible enough to believe the police officers version and gave a direction to the ISD of the base hospital that he may act according to the powers vested upon him by the section 370 of the CPC if any doctor refuses to obey his orders.
The next day morning, the same police sergeant came to the same teaching hospital where the body was, with the direction of the magistrate and met the consultant JMO who happened to be on duty that day. An extensive post-mortem examination was conducted by a post-graduate registrar in Forensic Medicine, all necessary samples were taken and it was concluded as under investigation until the test results were available and this was conveyed to the ISD of the local hospital.
The process of disposal of death is complicated and is not fool proof.
A thorough re-visit to the system is absolutely necessary to reorganise the system to minimise the loop holes and avoid corruption.
Officers in the judiciary, medical field and fields of scientific investigations should be aware of the practical pitfalls and loopholes and should develop the skill and gut feeling to sense any possibility of foul play.

Tears flow as Chapecoense return to action
CHAPECO: Thousands of fans gathered under a blazing sun in southern Brazil on Saturday as Chapecoense played their first match since most of their players were killed in an air crash in Colombia in November.
The friendly against Palmeiras was the first game of the season for both sides but it was much more about symbolism and emotion than sport for a club looking to bounce back from one of football's great tragedies.
The game was halted in the 71st minute to allow fans to scream their now famous Vamos Chape! chant in tribute to the players and staff who perished in a plane crash in Colombia in November.
The Arena Conda stadium was adorned with thousands of hand-made origami in the shape of hearts and tsurus, birds that signify health, good fortune and long life.
One banner behind the goals read, Eternal Champions, kit man to the president, a reference to the many players and backroom staff who died.
The survivors and their relatives took centre stage before a ball was kicked, with Jackson Follman, the goalkeeper whose leg was amputated as a result of the crash, being presented with the Copa Sudamericana trophy in a tearful ceremony.
Follman was one of only six people to survive the crash, which came as the Chapecoense squad approached Medellin to play Atletico Nacional in November's Copa Sudamericana final.
The plane ran out of fuel and hit a mountainside, killing 71 people on board, many of them players, officials and reporters on their way to the game.
Chapecoense were awarded the Sudamericana title by CONMEBOL in December after the fixture was cancelled.
In an emotional ceremony, the wives of the dead players were given the medals their husbands would have received.
Follman, who was wheeled into the centre circle in his wheelchair, cried as he lifted the trophy, Chapecoense's first ever continental title.
The game that followed was hard fought but with a scorching sun overhead and both sides giving their squads their first run out of the season it was never more than a glamorous training match.
Palmeiras scored the opener after nine minutes when Raphael Veiga nipped in between hesitant defenders to score from just inside the box.
Douglas Grolli equalised for the home side five minutes later when he headed home a free kick from the left. Amaral gave Chapecoense the lead just minutes into the second half with a glancing header.
But Vitinho grabbed a late equaliser for Palmeiras with a spectacular left-foot shot from outside the box with 12 minutes left.
The ground was well short of its 20,000 capacity but those who did turn out said they hoped it was the start of a new era for the club.
We couldn't not be here, Sizelda Filipi, a fan who lives around 30 kms from the ground, said shortly before kick-off. We'll get very emotional and then we'll move on. This is a restart.

Teen inventor of generating electricity from waste water seeks help
Jittendran Jude Sajith of Mannar Sithyvinayagar Hindu College, a past student of St. Peters College, Colombo 4, participating at the International Conference of Young Scientists 2017, under the supervision of senior research scientist Dr. Gamini Piyadasa of the Sri Lanka Nano Technology Institute, invented a new efficient method of generating electricity from waste water that provides a solution to waste water treatment.
His research hypothesis states that he had increased the purification efficiency level by 16 percent and could generate electricity from one power plant per day that would supply electricity for the whole treatment process, and the surplus is sufficient enough to be distributed to 800 modern houses a day, estimating that each house consumes 55 units per month.
Sajith also stated that purifying the wastewater through the process that he recommends can completely reduce the Nano heavy metal particle contamination, where the traditional method of purifying waste water does not have a suitable and efficient method of purification.
He has introduced a new theory called 'The theory of electro negative interruption' and also relies under the existing Technology of Microbial Fuel cells.
Sajith's initial experiments which he conducted two years ago is that he has observed abnormal electricity generation from mud slug in lakes.
After long terms of statistical analysis and gathering information from the internet he came up with a solution stating that the electricity output was an effect of some biological action.
What he has found out after two years of research is that a certain rare bacterial species present in the soil is the reason for abnormal electricity secretion from mud, and also present in an existing technology called Microbial fuel cells.
Believing that he would come out with a solution, he further continued his research without quitting and as an outcome invented a method of generating electricity out of bacteria. Using the same bacteria, he modified the DNA of the bacteria enabling it to perform a heavy metal reduction process that would accelerate the electricity outcome and also through the modification of the DNA.
He stated that the antibiotic contaminant present in the waste water would be completely removed. When he presented his findings at local invention competitions, many including the jury panel stated that this cannot be true and the electricity outcome will be partial and would stop in a couple of hours.
Later he gained access to an advanced laboratory with incubation facilities which enabled him to prove that they were wrong about his theory.
His new control experiment made from a mobile phone charger out of 10 cups of organic lake mud that gave an output of 6 volts at 300m Ah made him charge a mobile phone and parallel connected to two leds which continuously worked for one month.
With that experiment he came to the conclusion that electricity production rate stopped leaving carbon credits in the soil, and then later designed a balanced chemical equation for the decomposition process taking place.
He has seen success in his research and is willing to expand his research to make perfection and implementation.
Sajith is in search of organisations and private parties to fund his project. He also requires recommendations to purchase his bacterial strain which is needed to complete his prototype construction..

## Title: Think twice before using your toothbrush

Think twice before using your toothbrush
Your current one probably contains faeces, herpes or even the virus responsible for hepatitis. Within just two days, toothbrushes can become heavily infected with disease-causing bacteria, viruses and fungi.
And it doesn't matter whether you keep it in your bathroom or under 24-hour surveillance - it's contaminated, a leading expert has warned.
Dr Rhona Eskander, a dentist based in Kensington and Chelsea, says there are numerous dangers to your health by not keeping it clean.
And sharing brushes or letting them touch other ones is just as bad for you, according to London's Young Dentist of the Year 2016.
She told MailOnline: 'The mouth harbours literally hundreds of different types of microorganisms, some of which can be transferred to a toothbrush during use.
*
'Microorganisms in the bathroom or household environment may also collect on a stored toothbrush - especially after the toilet has been flushed.'
'When toothbrushes are stored in close together and touching in a tooth mug, the germs can pass from one to another, leading to the risk of cross contamination.
'Rinsing a toothbrush under running water from the tap does not remove all these germs.
'If you borrow a toothbrush which has been used by someone else the viruses which cause conditions such as herpes and hepatitis A, B and C can be transferred to you, as studies have shown that they can survive for months on a toothbrush.'
Toothbrushes are a known source of contamination.
Since the 1920s scientists suspected that the re-use of toothbrushes could be a possible source of infection in the oral cavity.
While nearly 40 years ago, a study published in the Scandinavian Journal of Dental Research discovered they also often contain Streptococcus mutans.
This bacteria is known to build-up in the mouth, being a leading cause of tooth decay and the breakdown of enamel - the thin protective covering.
The same scientists also argued that using the same toothbrush helped to kill off healthy germs found within the mouth.
Instead they can introduce more dangerous ones to the mouth, including enteric bacteria and pseudomonads.
These can lead to diarrhoea, skin rashes and ear infections, among other things, according to medical literature.
And in 2015, researchers from Quinnipiac University in Connecticut found that 60 per cent of toothbrushes are covered in faeces.
But they also discovered that there's only a 20 per cent chance of it being your own - instead it's more than likely to be your husband's, wife's, or whoever your share your house with.
Another study led by Professor Richard Glass in 1988 found that the Herpes virus can remain viable on a dried toothbrush for at least 48 hours.
While in a moist environment, such as that of a bathroom, it can survive for longer than a week, according to the University of Arizona scientist.
1. Don't flush where you brush
If you must store your toothbrush near your toilet make sure you close the lid when you flush to minimise the dispersal of contaminated water droplets, and encourage your family to do the same.
2. Store it upright and alone
Store your toothbrush in an upright position - never in a bathroom cabinet where air cannot circulate as this could promote bacterial growth. Try and avoid putting more than one brush in a tooth mug to avoid cross contamination.
3. Replace your toothbrush regularly
Make sure you replace your toothbrush and Steripod every 3 months - buy them at the same time. And if you've been suffering with a cold or flu it's a good idea to replace your toothbrush.
4. Don't share it
This should go without saying, but never be tempted to share a toothbrush, even with your loved ones.

Third days play abandoned due to rain
Heavy rain washed out the entire third day's play of the second test between New Zealand and Bangladesh at Hagley Oval in Christchurch on Sunday.
Rain had forced the players off early on Saturday and the hosts were to have resumed their first innings on 260 for seven, a deficit of 29 runs, with Henry Nicholls on 56 while Tim Southee was on four.
However, downpours overnight ensured there would be at least a delay to the start of play, but when the rain did not stop umpires Paul Reiffel and Nigel Llong abandoned play without a ball being bowled at the conclusion of the scheduled tea break at 1600 local (0300 GMT).
Bangladesh were dismissed for 289 with about five minutes remaining on the opening day's play on Friday with Southee taking five wickets.

UAG and Fairfirst go beyond a business calling
For years now, Union Assurance General Limited (UAG) has been at the forefront of working towards creating safer roads in Sri Lanka. They have been doing so by working with the Sri Lanka Traffic Police Headquarters as the official insurance partner of the Road Safety Awareness Program.
As a leading insurance provider to officially partner with one of the main governing bodies that monitor road safety in Sri Lanka, UAG has continued to support this project since its inception in 2012.
Over the year 2016 alone, UAG successfully conducted over 50 road safety awareness programs for schools and the general public. They have covered a total of 150 schools islandwide and reached out to over 25,000 people and school children in the process.
What we aim to accomplish through these programs is to safeguard our countrys future generations, said Upul Chandana Director Traffic at the Sri Lanka Traffic Police Headquarters.
These Road Safety programmes include a thorough training session for school traffic wardens. They are educated on Road Rules and Traffic Control and subsequently issued traffic warden vests and a certificate by us endorsing them as official school traffic wardens.
As of today UAG together with the Sri Lanka Traffic Police have trained and endorsed a total of 1,600 traffic wardens.
Furthermore, Fairfirst Insurance also recently collaborated with the Traffic Police to create awareness on the islandwide Road Safety week. Now a part of the Fairfax Group, Fairfirst Insurance is expected to undertake initiatives promoting community welfare in the months to come.
Giving back to the community is a huge part of the Fairfax Groups value system. In 2015 alone, the group had made donations amounting to USD 15.1 million. We believe that business is a good thing. By doing well as a business, we are able to do some good for the people we work with, because investing in the well-being of communities is something we strongly believe in, said Niranjan Nagendra, General Manager Sales & Marketing at UAG.
Union Assurance General is part of the Fairfax Group, one the largest general insurance groups in the world with operations across geographies. Most recently UAG acquired 100% shares of Asian Alliance General Insurance, now re-branded as Fairfirst Insurance.

UTSE blames UGC for shortage of students to degree programmes at state universities
The University Teachers for Social Equity (UTSE) say a significant shortage can be witnessed in admission to some of the degree programmes of the government universities when compared to the allocated number of students by the University Grants Commission (UGC).
They said a large number of vacancies in the science faculties and agriculture faculties of the UGC funded universities during the past years and the relevant authorities had not been able to take reliable actions to resolve this issue.
The UGC has not yet provided final lists of the selected students who passed GCE (A/L) examinations in 2015 to the many of the science and agriculture faculties within the government university system where the students have the opportunities to follow physical science, biological science, computer science, fisheries and agriculture degree programmes, the UTSE said."When we analyse the statistics published by the UGC itself, it is possible to identify the gravity of this issue.
Present and previous ministers responsible for Higher Education have been quoting numbers of university admissions from their publications and have been promising that they have been increasing the number of student admissions to universities.
It is evident that those statements are not really truthful and that there is a decrease in admissions of students to many of the degree programmes.
Some parties, who are justifying and promoting private universities, supports the argument that the government universities has no sufficient facilities and opportunities to expand the government funded universities to increase the number of students. However, the documents published by the UGC reveal that the required number of admissions to government funded universities had not been done by the UGC for many years to use the facilities and opportunities available within those universities.|
As a result of this situation, a significant number of students who are unable to afford the cost of private universities had lost their opportunities for higher education and therefore it had prevented the right and the opportunity of the public for using revenue of tax in an optimal manner.
This is a highly critical issue for the innocent children who have no any other way of protecting their future other than going through higher education, the UTSE noted in its press release.

Van Goghs Flowers revisited
Its a funny thing, being a writer. Sometimes, I dont want to write. But I always want to create. I want to make art. I want to take my mind off of the inauguration of a president whose name I cannot bear to say, or the fact that I am not writing, or the many small irritations of the day. I want to go to a better place. So, I paint flowers. Honestly, I find this to be a little bit embarrassing. It makes me think almost antifeminist, anti-Marcy like thoughts. Flowers. How cute. Inane. Painting flowers. It is so easy to devalue oneself.
My favorite place to go see art is the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. This is my favorite museum of all museums. It has always been a special place for me, a place I can always go back to, where I have gone since childhood. I was floored by the audacity of Donna Tartt, who opened The Goldfinch with a nightmarish terrorist attack set in the Met galleries. I often think of that fictional attack when I am thereimagine the smoke and the fear and the smell of burning body parts, as I wander amidst tourists gazing at Dutch masterpieces, oblivious.
When I go in summer, it usually means a quick trip to the Impressionists and then the elevator to the roof to take in the newest rooftop installation and the dazzling view of Central Park. Two summers ago, up on the roof with my father and daughter, I ordered us three fresh-squeezed lemonades which my father then paid for. He complained bitterly about the cost. Six dollars a lemonade. I ignored him, as I sometimes do. Of course, they were worth it. We sat on a bench and drank one of the worlds most delicious drinks and I felt grateful for where I was in that moment in my life, grateful for the people I was with. I had left my husband not that long ago, and this day at the Met, the simple wonder of it, was reassuring.
On a recent visit, on a bitterly cold day at the end of a tumultuous 2016, my friend Lauren and I walked slowly through the galleries, holding our coats because the coat-check line was so long. We were, for the most part, quiet, occasionally pointing out a painting that we loved. Lauren was on the lookout for finely painted hands. I lingered in front of a famous Degas sculpture, The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer. I remembered a picture I had taken of this sculpture, my elderly father and young daughter standing next to the bronze dancer. As I stood there in December, I realized that my father will probably never return to the Met. His heart is failing. He can no longer walk long distances.
My leisurely wandering with Lauren took us through the Impressionists, of course, because I always end up back with the Impressionists, never knowing what painting will capture me. This time it was the Van Goghs. The flowers.
As a child, his work didnt mean much to me. I only knew that Van Gogh was the artist who cut off his ear. And as a child, most art, beyond the mummies in the Egyptian exhibit, did not mean much to me. I went to the Met because my parents took me. A parent myself, I find that I believe we should always take our children to see art, even if they declare museums to be boring. They do not know what is unknowingly sinking in. They have no idea.
Now it felt as if I was seeing Van Goghs flowers for the first time. He painted beautiful, wondrous, almost mesmerizing flowers. Irises. Roses. Oleanders. The paint is thick on the canvas, so thick that you can see the swirls of the petals rising, almost alive.

War heroes will not be sent to gallows: Wijeyadasa
Foreign parties have no right to demand that our war heroes be sent to the gallows. If they do so, we too will have to probe the crimes committed by colonial rulers including the damage to properties and the killing of our national heroes Ven. Kudapole thera, Weera Puran Appu, and Gongalegoda Banda among others during the time of British governors such as Brownrigg, Buddhasasana and Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
He was addressing a meeting at Embilipitya to mark the opening of a new two-storey building at the Embilipitiya Courts Complex recently.
People dying during wars in any country is a natural phenomenon. Damages to properties are the same. Today western countries have the audacity to speak about human rights in Sri Lanka when our own people have no qualms about this issue.
We in Sri Lanka do not manipulate our own courts system to their tune. We would explicitly reiterate that we do not need any foreign judges to matters concerning our country when we have our own team of competent panel of judges to do so, the minister said.
Wijeyadasa said Sri Lanka would never legalise homosexualism as it was against the tenets of Buddhism and Buddhist culture. Dr. Rajapakshe who also hinted that the government would introduce a new constitution emphasised that it would never harm the status of Buddhism.
Judges of the Embilipitiya High Court, District Court, and Magistrates Court, and the Embilipitiya bar members were present.

We can beat dengue: Lets do it
Dengue is the fastest-growing mosquito-borne viral infection, and its impact today is 30 times greater than that of 50 years ago. In the 1970s, less than 10 countries reported dengue epidemics. Now over 150 countries suffer dengue threat. While Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Western Pacific report most of dengue cases, many African countries including Europe, the USA and China also experience dengue epidemics. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 40 percent of the worlds population irrespective of their ages is at risk of being infected with dengue.
The dengue mosquito
Scientific name: Aedes aegypti
Distinct physical features  black and white stripes or spots
Bites during the day
Lifespan: 2-4 weeks
Does not fly far (up to 400 meters) - lives near the breeding areas; this means that people rather than the mosquito are likely to move the disease from place to place
Lays eggs. the larvae develop even in very shallow water
Eggs can survive desiccation (drying out) for long periods and hatch once re-submerged in water, making control of this species very difficult
Only the female Aedes mosquito feeds on blood. This is because they need the protein found in blood to produce eggs. Male mosquitoes feed only on plant nectar
Female Aedes mosquito lays about 300 eggs at a time in different spots, about 2-3 times during its lifespan
Four types of dengue virus strains have been identified and the infection causes a wide range of symptoms. Having been infected once does not protect you from the other three strains of the virus. The second time symptoms are more severe.
Infection spread through mosquito bites; all it takes is a single bite from an infected mosquito.
Spread of dengue
Dengue spreads in many ways. Warm temperatures spread dengue transmission by increasing survival and biting rates, as well as decreasing the extrinsic incubation period of the dengue virus in mosquitoes. Dengue, being a tropical fever, thrives in warm and wet conditions. Climate Change, El Nino effect, increased rainfall and man-made environment increase the spread.
Breeding grounds
Stagnant drains; gutters; sloppy garbage collection and disposal; construction sites with areas of stagnant water; discarded tires, plastic containers, and flower pots; schools, hospitals, government buildings with vulnerable breeding areas and unkept grounds and storerooms; polluted canals and waterways that snake through many tenements in the city and suburbs; abandoned houses and premises and dilapidated buildings, among others.
Present situation
The National Dengue Control Unit have taken many efforts for the last decade to control dengue. Fogging, inspecting households, and enforcing fines are some of them. The information released by this unit indicates that the highest number of cases for 2016 were recorded from Colombo (15,400), Gampaha (6,298), Galle (2,808), and Kalmune and Ampara (815), with 815 deaths in 2016.
Many governments in other developing and developed nations are already pursuing aggressive means to fight dengue. Current efforts focus on prevention, such as using insecticides or reducing potential egg-laying habitats for dengue mosquitoes. Various organisations are also making progress in terms of immunization, with the most advanced vaccine candidate soon to be introduced in endemic countries.
However, this is not enough  elimination of dengue calls for a globally coordinated and integrated approach, which risks becoming a global pandemic.
Dengue Control  Think outside the Box
For years, all kinds of warnings were issued, precautions announced and anti-dengue drives were carried out in earnest, but we are still back at square one. Our health care system has made great strides in effectively managing and treating the disease; however, the recent increase in a hemorrhagic strain of dengue threatens to overburden our health care infrastructure. Dengue has become an epidemic in Sri Lanka. It is time that the health authorities got back to the drawing board and map out a definitive plan to contain the epidemic.
Lets learn from others  look at the successful campaign against dengue in Lahore, Pakistan where 20,000 cases in 2011 were brought down to a couple of dozens in 2013 (http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/09/16/223051694/ how-smartphones-became-vital-tool-against-dengue-in-pakistan)
The key steps taken by the Lahore campaign that can be incorporated by the Dengue Monitoring Unit in Sri Lanka:
* A Dengue hotspot map of the Colombo District, the most heavily affected area to start off with * A Google map that correlates the locations of dengue cases and hot spots for mosquito larvae.
* Easy to remember telephone numbers to report any dengue breeding locations
* Photos of potential dengue breeding areas/locations and address of breeding sites, and requesting the general public to send information on any potential breeding sites to the Monitoring Unit
* Dedicated Staff that can follow up on the photos sent and any complaints. They should also record the actions taken and follow up activities
This information will help the dengue control unit to target the areas that are breeding grounds for dengue, and also future potential breeding grounds.
The success story of the Lahore programme was that the authorities were able to destroy potential breeding areas of larvae (with the data gathered the previous year), before the onset of dengue following the rains.
* Create a similar App or new one  this can be done by Sri Lankan IT researchers and students, together with the Dengue Control Unit, taking the local context into account. We already have an App called Mo Buzz dengue, but no one seemed to be using it  may be it is not user-friendly, or the authorities do not get the correct information to act on it or only a few people are aware of it. We should find out the format of the Apps used in Lahore to make it effective.
These methods need a little technology and smart phones, but it is easy to implement and can be done rapidly. Lahore has demonstrated that it can be done by cooperating with the general public and dedicated officials.
The Health Ministry authorities should take a holistic view of the whole problem and attack it at the core, instead of relying on piecemeal solutions. All segments of society  households, schools, temples and other places of religious worship, government departments and construction sites should be co-opted to carry out a successful anti dengue drive. Imposing fines of Rs. 25,000 as suggested could be an effective deterrent
Awareness creation
The public can also cooperate by adding salt water or soapy water to small pools of water or stagnant drains to destroy dengue larvae.
Dengue is spread through mosquito bites from an infected person to another. Infected persons should sleep under a net till the fever subsides and they are no longer infectious. Homes of infected persons should be immediately fogged so that infected mosquitoes in the vicinity are immediately destroyed before further spread of the disease. Neighbours should be informed, so they can remain vigilant for a few days following detection of initial case in their vicinity.
We are talking here of saving lives, especially those of the most vulnerable in our population- young children and the elderly. Together we can do it; we can beat the dengue epidemic let's do it.

The Weight of My Fathers Poems
A few years ago, at my request, my father gave me a suitcase full of poems. Fifty pounds of poems, to be exact, most of them handwritten on loose-leaf paper, the only existing copies. I estimate there are over 4,000 in that suitcase, but hes written many more. My parents are frugal people; I was leaving by plane, so they made sure it did not exceed the weight limit allowed for a free checked bag. They removed stacks of poems and placed the suitcase back on the scale it until it was the exactly correct amount.
I have hauled these poems to Colorado, back to Idaho, then to Oregon. I feel the tension in my arms when I lift the suitcase; I feel the weight of my fathers devotion. Whenever I reach inside and pull out a poem at random, my fathers past and presence fill the room. The poems about his painful childhood and my idyllic one are mixed together, their ragged notebook edges entangled.
I have memories of these poems beyond the events they contain. Reading them, I also recall my father writing them. I think of the cold winters of my very early childhood in Athol, Idaho, my father in his small attic room, the library. I think of him sitting in his chair with sawdust on his shoulders, scribbling in one of his large journals, his giant, clumsy fingers pained with early arthritis. He is a disheveled, looming man, skinny but strong, a brow furrowed with what seems to be perpetual concern. Fondly, we now call him the Old Bastard; fondly, we make fun of his gleefully stupid humor and his bad habits. But underneath all that, we respect to a painful degree the mystery that he is. He can put an animal out of its misery swiftly and without hesitation, but I have also seen his eyes fill with tears at the sight of a sunset.
In my vision of him in the attic library, his hair is dark, braided down his back, his beard unruly. His back is still in pain from an injury suffered decades before. He has just come from splitting wood in the snow, into the house where my mother is soothing, maybe, four upset children. There are cattle in the pasture, new kittens in the barn, chickens to be butchered, sheds to be torn down and sheds to build, brush piles to burn, papers to grade, cars that wont start.
Article continues after advertisement
And still, my father wrote. And still, my father writes. Beneath my parents house are storage tubs filled with beautiful hand-written novels; in his office are filing cabinets heavy with song. On my 21st birthday, I received a seven-volume letter from him written over the course of my lifetime about my siblings and me. Now, under my bed are two enormous binders holding a typed copy of his 2,000-page novel.He doesnt write out of compulsion, and he doesnt write to escape. He writes as a form of rescue.
My father was the oldest of five children. After his family lost their ranch, they lived a life of poverty in the government projects of California. In spite of their daily struggle to find food and avoid violence, my father dreamed in perfect sonnetshe actually dreamed in iambic pentameter. He needed only to record first thing in the morning what he had already written in his sleep. His whole sense of self, even his unconscious life, was shaped by poetry; it was the lens through which he saw the world. He was Catholic, then. Sometimes I think his Catholicism was a part of his deep connection to language:
To save the soul, one must arrange his actions into a confession, into sentences that he delivers to someone else who, in turn, delivers him to forgiveness.His parents were well-meaning people, but his father, who died when my father was still a teenager, had been an alcoholic, and his mother was usually lost in drugs. She had many boyfriends, some of them addicts, some of them patients from the county mental institution. The worst of these boyfriends, a codeine addict, became my fathers stepfather. He was a manipulative and unpredictable man whose cruelty toward my fathers black half-brotherthen only four years oldfinally drove my father away in an attempt to save them all. He was only a teenager. He was desperate and bitter and hurt, and given to violence when he thought he had to be. He saw only two options for his four younger siblings salvation: Either he would kill his stepfatherand there was one horrifying day in which he believed he had done exactly that, bashing the mans head against a bathtub until he was unconsciousor he would go off to college and become a famous writer, returning a rich man and his siblings savior.
When I think of my naive young father walking, in his mind, a fine line between vengeful murderer and famous writer, I feel so much love for him that it becomes a kind of pain all its own. Of course, he didnt save his siblings in the way that he intended. But he did try. He went to college, and while there, he took a job shoveling manure on a ranch owned by actor James Brolin. He did this not just for wages, but also on the hope that some famous personality visiting the ranch would notice the long-haired, skinny young man shoveling manure in the backyard and ask, Do you happen to be a writer Because I happen to have connections. My dad didnt know many people in positions of power, and he thought that if a person had some of it, they had it all.
There was one time that someone did come up to him on that ranch. James Brolins wife at the time, the woman who had hired my father, was a Hollywood agent. When he applied for the job, he made sure to mention to her that he had a collection of short stories that he hoped to publish soon, to earn money for his impoverished family. A few months later, when my father was in a stable shoveling manure, she began to walk toward him with the actor Mac Davis beside her, and my dad felt his heart race. The agent said to Mac Davis, Theres someone Id like you to meet. I think he shows a lot of promise.
My dad was filthy. He was covered in manure to his knees, but he straightened up. He brushed off his pants. He held his pitchfork still, and he waited in the careful dignity of his stillness to shake the hand of the songwriter and actor he so admired.
But when they arrived at the stall where he waited, the woman introduced Mac Davis not to my father but, impossibly, to the horse beside him.
It was a painful moment for him, and I think of it with rage and sadness and shame, because I know thats what my dad felt, even though there is no poem in the suitcase that says so. Or maybe there ismaybe I just havent found it yet.
And although he didnt become famous, my father did rescue his siblings. He did this by making it through what he might not have survived without his navet and his pained romantic heart. He rescued them by choosing literature over the violence that might have spared them cruelty but would have left them with an imprisoned brother, and without an iambic dream to step toward foreverthe dream that there is another life waiting just on the other side of a chance meeting in a stable.

When Culture Beckons
There was a tangible sense of occasion at the Punchi Theatre on Tuesday night. The audience was sprinkled with several stars. For someone who never watches TV, it was a eureka moment to be able to identify three out of the four famous television actors and actresses who were the chief guests, presenter Arun Dias Bandaranaike, Prof. Ariyarathna Kaluarachchi, Vice Chancellor, University of the Visual & Performing Arts, as well as several prominent personalities of the media. But the real sparkle came from the stage.
The event was the preview of Punchi Theatre's newest venture, ("my new pissuwa" as Namel Weeramuni describes it, but which Arun Dias Bandaranaike changed to "Namel's sweet pissuwa') - the presentation of traditional Sri Lankan dances, ranging from the Raban to Peacock to Pantheru, amazingly engaging, rich and dynamic, each accompanied by mesmerising beats of the traditional drums.
In a series of events that will commence from January 26 to be continued every Thursday, every week, in this new venture Namel and Malini Weeramuni have opened the doors of the Punchi Theater to the undergraduates of the University of Visual and Performing Arts with the sole aim of keeping the torches burning for the dying arts of our ancestors.
The handsomely crafted and grippingly dramatic dance movements on stage seen on Tuesday - while adhering strictly to the deep rooted traditions of our past - were really quite different from the conventional dances we have seen elsewhere, probably because they were not tediously too long. There were magical passages in the harvest dance, breathtaking leaps and somersaults in the Pantheru, a timely and touching opening dance, representing dances from different ethnic groups in the Pooja Narthanaya, and a particularly bewitching spell cast by the two dancers who performed the ves - enthralling the audience with half eerie, half uncanny beauty.
Tuesday evening was notable, too, for another debut.
The launch of the Punchi Theatre's website, http://www.punchitheatre.com immortalising in the digital arena "the tranquil creative establishment that offers a soothing haven to those who seek to experience and relish in the oasis of performing arts" called the "Namel Malini Punchi Theatre or the "Lair" (to quote the text from the website).
The cultural show is the first event to be listed on the website, hopefully paving the way for other such events rejuvenating the traditional arts, nurtured by the warm, enduring love of the Weeramunis for all that is good in the Sri Lankan culture. The Punchi Theatre might be small in stature, but the great contributions made by its founders, Namel and Malini Weeramuni to the local arts are too vast to be measured.
Be there at the Punchi Theatre on January 26 at 4.30pm when the young university students will take the stage again as the show opens for the public, unraveling age-old art forms with new energy, some with glowing warmth, and delicate, fluttering movements, others with spellbinding, effortless somersaults that leave the audience gasping for breath.
The programme, scheduled to be staged on every Thursday from now on, marked with rich details, is a remarkable collective effort from a group of young people in flying form.
Make use of this unique opportunity to tap your toes to the same drumbeats, to feast your eyes with the same dance movements our ancestors enjoyed countless sunsets ago. You will soon realise Namel Weeeramuni's 'craze' is really pretty sane.

Pooja Narthanaya or Invocation Dance
It is customary to commence Sri Lankan cultural events with a Pooja dance. It invokes the blessing of the Triple Gem and the local deities on the performers, as well as, the audience. Pooja dance is an amalgamation of the three classical dance forms of Sri Lanka. All such three dance forms are identified as Kandyan, Low country, and Sabaragamuwa, The classical Indian dance is identified as Bharatha Natyam.
Ves
Ves is identified by the characteristic traditional attire of the Kandyan dance performer. Dance form is considered as a white magic ritual related to the Up Country Main Dance tradition known as "Khoba Kan Kariya". Basically classical in concept, the dancer uses intricate rhythmic patterns intensifying to a vigorous and lively climax.
Thelme
Thelme is a brilliant expression of the pure rhythmical and classical dance form of the Low-Country tradition. It is a dance that highlights in the ritual, "Devol Maduwa" or " Gammaduwa". It is performed in honour of Goddess Paththini or Amman.
Peacock
The dance is based on "Mayura vannama". Its techniques derive from Kandyan Dance forms. It depicts various movements of the Peacock, embellished by vibrant colours and lithe footsteps adding a vision of glamour to the performance.
Salupaliya
It is believed that illnesses were brought on humans by demons. These beliefs and rituals have prehistoric roots. Accordingly a bad influence hits directly by a demon or Sanni. Sanni means disease. In the ritual of Sanniyakuma there are 18 Sanni and 12 Pali. Salupaliya is one of the most superb humorous dances - just known as "Pali". This item stems from rituals.
Folk Dance / Harvesting Dance
During the harvesting period village damsels come to the paddy field for cutting and collecting paddy. This item depicts how they enjoy whilst they are engaged in such activities.
Pantheru Dance
Pantheruwa refers to a particular brass ring. Dancers perform with the pantheru using in various rhythmic patterns. This item belongs to the Kandyan dance form.
Naga Raksha and Gurulu Raksha
Kolama is a dramatic and colourful performance. It is performed in the Southern part of Sri Lanka.Naga & Gurulu Mask dances belong to Kolam play.
Raban Dance
Hand Raban is about one foot in diameter. Some performers keep revolving the Raban on the tip of their fingers while others play it, accompanied by singing. This is played with one hand only.
Drum Orchestra
It's orchestrated through various thunderous musically oriented drum beats. It's really a beautiful orchestra of percussionary band performers.
It is resourced mainly through classical music and its related rhythms.

Why a Bollywood memoir about being gay in India has kicked up a storm

Bollywood director and talk show host Karan Johar's autobiography has opened a loud debate on being gay in India, writes Sudha G Tilak.
Everybody knows what my sexual orientation is. I don't need to scream it out. If I need to spell it out, I won't only because I live in a country where I could possibly be jailed for saying this. Which is why I Karan Johar will not say the three words that possibly everybody knows about me, Johar says in the book.
The title of his memoir, An Unsuitable Boy, is a take on A Suitable Boy by award-winning Indian author Vikram Seth.
Seth has spoken up against India's draconian law that criminalises homosexuality and his mother, a former judge and writer, has written about Seth being gay.
In an interview Seth had said that it was a sad dereliction of their responsibility when famous Indians refused to come out and be role models for many others who were suffering silently.
However, Johar's memoir, co authored with journalist Poonam Saxena, does not.
Bollywood's budding filmmakers, activists and Twitterati have come down on him saying how he has only trivialised being gay in his films, and holding back from coming out and leaving bold clues belittle their suffering.
To answer those who demand that he come out, Johar writes, The reason I don't say it out aloud is simply that I don't want to be dealing with the FIRs [police complaints]. I'm very sorry. I have a job, I have a commitment to my company, to my people who work for me; there are over a hundred people that I'm answerable to.
I'm not going to sit in the courts because of ridiculous, completely bigoted individuals who have no education, no intelligence, who go into some kind of rapture for publicity.
According to Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), a 155-year-old colonial-era law, a same-sex relationship is an unnatural offence. Last February, the Supreme Court agreed to revisit a previous judgment that upheld the law.
'Cowardly'
In deeply conservative India, homosexuality is a taboo and many people still regard same-sex relationships as illegitimate.
However, Johar has been criticised by many and trolled on Twitter for not using his privilege and popularity to set an example for gays in India.
One of them is Apurva Asrani, a scriptwriter and editor of Aligarh, a gay rights Bollywood film based on true incidents.
Asrani went on social media to criticise Johar's autobiography and his resistance to come out and said he was appalled. He called Johar's extract on his sexuality regressive and a cowardly statement.
Johar's book also details his lonely childhood, his growing up in a plush neighbourhood in Mumbai with children of the film industry where his father was a producer, and his weight issues.
The book also talks about Johar's well-known friendship with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and his spats with Bollywood's leading ladies.
Johar's films have been set in locations in America or Britain dealing with romantic issues of the rich and the beautiful.
His films have been criticised for stereotyping women as in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and peddling fluff.
They have often poked fun of gay characters and have used innuendos and jokes while referencing gays in his films.
'Courageous'
His production house may have backed many meaningful films that have spoken about gay issues with sensitivity, but his own storytelling in his movies and memoir has been lacking, say critics.
Johar's TV show is hugely popular and is filled with Bollywood's beautiful people discussing their crushes, courting controversies and fuelling gossip and adult jokes.
Johar also allows gay jokes, uses self-mocking throwaway lines about his sexuality and innuendo, which has irked critics for trivialising his sexuality and for not standing up.
But he has also been praised for his openness. His book is remarkably candid and courageous. He has shared his vulnerabilities and fears, writer and publisher Shobhaa De said of Johar.
Johar, one of the cleverest and most influential Bollywood directors, isn't giving the pleasure of saying what everyone knows, gay rights or not withstanding.

Why exercise doesn't always help: It makes you lazier in between time you're in the gym
Gym regimes are meant to be an extra boost to our everyday lives - making us healthier, sharper, and more youthful.
But new research by the National Institutes of Health shows it may not be as helpful as we think.
A study found mice who had one big spurt of physical exertion during the day were lazier the rest of the time. It meant their overall physical activity leveled out, and they were barely getting any more exercise than they did before starting a gym regime.
A study by the National Institutes of Health found mice who had a big spurt of exercise during the day were lazier the rest of the time. It meant their overall physical activity leveled out
The team led by Timothy O'Neal, a government obesity researcher, embarked on the study to understand why exercise seems to be ineffective for so many people in the US.
Although important for overall health, exercise generally falls short on the goal of weight loss (effect size is typically less than 3 percent of body weight, even in studies lasting more than a year), they write.
To examine the issue, they put 15 mice in a room with running wheels.
At first, the introduction of a running wheel increased daily energy expenditure in the mice.
However, this plateaued after one week, despite further increments in wheel use. By the end of the study, they concluded the amount of wheel use did not increase their total daily energy expenditure. They concluded that, aside from increasing appetite, exercise may also decrease general energy - both contributing to poor weight loss. -Daily Mail

Why India doesn't want Trincomalee

Sri Lankan Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonsekas comments that talks are on with India for developing the Trincomalee harbour, has ruffled feathers in the island nation in the context of a growing opposition to Colombos policy of appeasing India by offering it big ticket projects to compensate for those offered to China.
Lankan nationalists fear that their country, recovering from a 30-year-war, might become an arena of power politics, putting its hard-won peace and sovereignty in jeopardy.
But they are not aware that India is not interested in any harbour in Lanka except the Third Container Terminal in the Colombo port, which, unlike the harbours in Hambantota and Trincomalee, makes business sense.
Colombo is an established Indian transshipment hub with huge potential. This is why two Indian firms bid for the Third Terminal.
 Though the Trincomalee port is one of the best natural harbours in the world with ten times the water and land area available in Colombo, it is neither on the main Indian Ocean shipping route nor does it have a hinterland. Prospects of it earning money are dim.
India does not want to be saddled with a non-performing asset if cash-strapped Sri Lanka defaults on loan repayment.
Sri Lanka had to give 80 per cent stake in the Hambantota port to China for 99 years because it couldnt repay the $ 1.4 billion loan. While China can afford to keep a non-performing asset indefinitely, India cannot.
 However, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has plans for the Trincomalee port and its hinterland as it connects the Bay of Bengal with the Indian Ocean, linking ports in Eastern India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Indonesia and the Far East. He has got Surbana Jurong of Singapore to do a feasibility study and is to call for a consortium.
While the Indian state may be indifferent, the Indian private sector could smell opportunities at least in hinterland development.

Work with a backbone, public officials told
Delimitation Review Committee Chairman Asoka Peiris yesterday called on the public officials to work with backbones without yielding to political pressure. Peiris was addressing a Diriya Purawesi National Representatives Convention organised by the JVP in Maharagama yesterday.
Peiris struck back at Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha during his speech, stating that he was under fire by the minister for not obeying his orders. I retired last year after 36 years of public service out of which 14 years were spent at the Elections Department. However, this is my first speech at a political meeting. I speak today knowing the risk that I take. The ministers have a preconceived notion about public officials. They think we are supposed to come, go, sit, stand up and raise our hands obeying their orders all the time like in the school. They want us to behave like kittens. We showed we do not conform to this model through our work at the Delimitation Committee, he said.At a press conference called by Minister Musthapha I told him to be quiet and allow me to speak. The minister seemed shocked. The irate minister had then asked who had nominated me to the Delimitation Committee. That is because I did not work as he wanted. However, many in the public service called me later to express their admiration for not yielding to pressure, Peiris said. Speaking of his past experience in the public service, he said a minister who was not alive now, was in the habit of calling the officials in the names of animals, adding that the officials should have had the backbone to refuse to obey the orders made in such derogatory terms. He also compared the country as a vehicle being driven without breaks, adding that it would come to a point that could not be moved forward any longer.
