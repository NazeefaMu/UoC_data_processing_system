Country needs healthy foreign trade policy
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) requests the President to provide them with an opportunity to explain a foreign trade policy that will protect the countrys job market and health sector, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the GMOA appreciates the assurance given by the President that any foreign trade agreement will not be signed that harms the country. But a `foreign trade policy formulated by a gang of foreigners has been launched now that could harm the country.
The media reported that a Sri Lankan delegation left for India yesterday to hold the final discussions on ETCA. It comprises foreign nationals and Sri Lankans who do not have any interest in protecting the country. They carried out various discussions on ETCA openly and secretly in the past, he said.
The GMOA explained to the government and the country several times that the ETCA would put Sri Lankan job market and several business sectors in jeopardy, he said.

Indo-Lanka FTA  win win situation  for both sides
Acting Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Arindam Bagchi said the Indian government has been focusing on reducing existing trade barriers and improving market access through FTAs between India and Sri Lanka.
Bagchi expressed hope that trade negotiators, to this end will come up with win-win solutions for both sides.
Its a give and take process, Im well aware that our negotiators will come up with win-win solutions for both parties.
The acting High Commissioner was speaking at the inauguration of India International Textiles Expo 2018 Exhibition and Cum Buyer Seller Meet, held at Hotel Galadari , Colombo.He further noted that the Sri Lankan apparel industry has shown significant growth over the years and the trade between Sri Lanka and India, especially between fabric and powerloom manufactures too has grown considerably over the years.
The apparel industry in Sri Lanka in a period of about three and a half decades has evolved to a world class manufacturer reaching an export revenue of US $ 4.7 billion.
This was during its evolution from a quota driven basic contract manufacturing era wherein the country has transitioned into sourcing management and thereafter advanced to supply chain management and presently it is aspiring to become a total solution provider from innovation to delivery.It was also revealed at a recent conference held on global apparel industry that the transformation of the Asian apparel industry is crucial for it is to move up the value chain by incorporating more value added activities in terms of front end design, research and development.
The application of advanced manufacturing , communication and supply chain technologies is essential for the future.
The apparel industry also needs to recognise the challenges and opportunities with respect to industry and what the industry will look like in 10 years time.
Globally, 60 million people are employed in the apparel industry including 15 million women workers, in factories located in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.

Longstanding issues in Mawanella need resolving
Whichever group that gains control of the Mawanella Pradesheeya Sabha after the current power struggle ends, should lay emphasis on resolving the main problems confronting the people which have remained unresolved over the years, residents of the area said.
They said the main unresolved problems which had dragged on for the past several years include the garbage problem, lack of proper amenities at the Mawanella town bus stand, sewage issues, Hemmathagama public market complex still being only half-complete, and the lack of a storm water drainage system and street-lighting system in Mawanella town.
They said the mountain of garbage dumped on the Randiwala Mountain had been subjected to earthslips in recent times, and it should come under a proper management. No one had paid attention towards modernising the Mawanella bus stand since it was last developed by former Minister Chandra Ranatunge in 1980.
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and the United National Party (UNP) have an equal number of 16 elected members in the Mawanella Pradesheeya Sabha, while the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) has five members. Two parties have to coalesce in order to gain administrative power in the Pradesheeya Sabha.

Head coach surprised by improvement shown in short space of time
Akila Dananjaya reminds me of  young Murali - Hathurusingha
There is a popular song hit by the name Everything I Touch Turns To Gold by English pop group Saint Etienne that can be attributed to Sri Lankas new head coach Chandika Hathurusingha who on his first assignment has changed the fortunes of the national team across all three formats  Tests, One-Day Internationals and T20 Internationals. Not so long ago this very same team was struggling to compete with other nations at international level and the cricket they played had reached a point of no return.
Hathurusingha is renowned for uplifting Bangladesh as an international cricket nation during his four-year tenure as coach and now he is beginning to do the same with the Sri Lanka team guiding them to a successful tour of Bangladesh where they won the Test and T20I series and emerged champions of the one-day tri-series that featured Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.
The DAILY NEWS caught up with Hathurusingha after the team returned from their triumphant tour of Bangladesh to get to know the intricacies of how the coach works with the players to form a winning combination and what the future looks like for the countrys cricket.
Q: Are you surprised by the results obtained in Bangladesh
CH: Not surprised by the results but surprised by the improvement we showed in a short space of time. I was surprised by the way we played and the dominance that we showed there. I expected to win but I also expected a lot more fight from Bangladesh especially in the ODIs and Tests.
Q: Do you believe in the old adage that the coach is only as good as the players
CH: The coach is only as good as the players because you cant go and bat and bowl for them I certainly believe in that. Then again if you dont utilise what you have then you can under achieve as well.
Q: You are credited with preparing players mentally and working on mental toughness, how much of that have you been doing with the Sri Lanka team
CH: Preparing mentally I dont know what I am doing you must ask the players. We try to be realistic, identify what our strengths are, the opportunities against that particular opponent and the conditions of the particular day and try to maximise every bit of talent we have. Thats what I am trying to do and probably get the players to understand their strengths and limitations.
Q: Can you elaborate on the sudden changes that have been brought about in the games of Thisara Perera and Kusal Mendis
CH: For both of them I saw immense potential. For example Thisara was never given the particular role that suited him in the past because of that he probably didnt realise how good he can be. But at the same time he has the second highest Man of the Match awards after another player in Sri Lanka. So that means there is something special in him to change the course of the game which I saw from outside before I came. He is a big part of our plans going forward. I spoke to him of what he can be and what he can do and how good he can be. Then myself, Rumesh (Ratnayake) and Thilan (Samaraweera) put him in a kind of a situation that he is challenged every time he comes to training, more than before. He did train differently in the last few months.
In the case of Kusal Mendis he had lost confidence in himself and a little bit of faith in his ability. It is natural for a young player to have success and a little bit of dip which I have experienced with some other players in other countries where I was coaching. Everyone can have that kind of dip but its nothing to be worried about. You have to trust your ability. I felt that a lot of information has been fed to him that has made him lose his way of playing and his actual strength. We had to clear his mind and identify his strengths.
Q: Was it a gamble you took giving an ODI cap to Shehan Madushanka (Tri-series final v Bangladesh) and a Test cap to Akila Dananjaya (2nd Test v Bangladesh)
CH: I dont take it as a gamble but I saw something special. I foresaw what they can do given the right role and environment. I believe that throwing talented players into the deep end is the best way to get them playing international cricket. When you put trust on them and if they are talented they will give you results. I spoke to Shehan and told him clearly what I wanted him to do and what he is capable of doing. Just go and do it without worrying about the outcome. Even Akila I thought he was a very good Test player although he was playing only one-day cricket. You have to play them in the right conditions. The conditions in which they played suited both of them.
Q: How do you rate Akila Dananjaya as a Test bowler
CH: He reminds me of young Murali because his off-spin is ideal for Test cricket, the loop, the speed that he bowls and the lines he bowls are for Test cricket. He can bowl a few other balls as well. I am not saying that he is going to play in every Test match going forward but whenever we think we need someone to suit the conditions we know that we have someone special.
Q: What do you bring to the table that other coaches dont
CH: I dont know to be honest. I believe if you do what other people are doing youll never be the best. You have to be really creative and be the leader of whatever you do thats what I believe. We cant copy other coaches from other countries. If you do that you cant be competitive youll always become second. If you want to be the best you have to be unique. I try to think differently and work on what I have and maximise it.
Q: How did you manage to change the fortunes of a team that has been struggling in international cricket so quickly
CH: For instance Bangladesh played the same team and dominated international cricket domestically for the past 3 years and we beat the same team. I think I read the game and the situation and I am probably blessed with that talent. I dont know. We did positional changes that is one thing. For example Kusal Mendis to open the batting and Dushmantha Chameera to bowl with the white new ball. My analyst showed me that he had played 9 matches and taken only one wicket in ODI cricket previously. I was surprised for someone like him taking one wicket in 9 games there was something wrong somewhere. We had to change it. There were also positional changes and there is a lot of tactical things involved which I dont want to divulge.
Q: Do you set challenges or any goals to the team
CH: Playing international cricket is a challenge itself. You are expected to win games. The challenge comes with playing for your country at the highest level. You have to play to win and find ways to do that.
Q: What does the team need to move forward
CH: We have a lot of areas we can still improve one thing is we need to believe that we are good enough and the confidence. We have a lot of injuries and we need to manage that, it is something to address. From last month or so we have changed the ways we trained that is going to help us to maximise our potential and help us to win all the time.

Around the world with Donald
The Donald Trunk children's book launch at the Jetwing Lighthouse was an extravaganza of outdoor theatre in which the characters from the book were brought to life and played by both Sri Lankan and Western actors. Children and adults were checked into the event by Donald's butterfly godmother and sitting by the first pool Bella Donna, Donald's mermaid friend, posed for pictures and showed how mermaids swim with only a blue silvery tail. In the kids area a whale was being overseen by Anoma, the hotel naturalist, who was telling all the kids fascinating facts about the blue whale, including its overall size when compared to an elephant, which is 40 times bigger and that you can hear them in outer space. As soon as the welcome drink was served, the theatrical performance involving the book characters began, with an exciting opening narration by the artist, Janet Anderton, and her Sri Lankan counterpart Mandara, who inspired the kids with her beautiful Sinhala translation of the book, which will come out later in the year.
Then, to move everyone to centre stage, the butterflies directed in both languages, Follow us! Hundreds of kids from all backgrounds did just that, and as the mermaid splashed across the pool, a life size monkey climbed up a tree next to it and Donald, a cheeky member of staff wearing an elephant costume, trumpeted, as if to say it is time to begin the grand opening. All this was, quite by chance, observed by the world famous author, Shrabani Basu, of the controversial, revelatory book of the true story of Victoria and Abdul, which has now been made into a blockbuster film with Judi Dench picking up several awards - she had just checked into her room to watch the extraordinary performance from her balcony. You can just imagine what must have been going through her amazingly creative mind as hundreds of people followed butterflies and mermaids across a pool, throwing flower petals and glitter, and how this lovely event has resulted in the most auspicious contact of all with her daughter, who, it turns out, runs The Children's Bookshop in London. So it could not have been a more serendipitous event for the Donald Trunk team.
As kids followed the menagerie of creatures that make up the Donald Trunk extravaganza, past the pool and down a cascading set of steps to their seats and cushions in the Jetwing Club grounds, prizes were being given out, as the cast took their places, complete with a laundry bag containing Satarnia, the evil snake temptress. The butterflies did everything they could to keep Donald away from the sneaky snake basket as the narrators took us on a journey in search of the real paradise, which is where we believe the real swimming elephants were making a break for. The sun shone, the kids faces never stopped smiling and, despite there being several hundred people of all ages, no one spoke, as they were so spell bound by the magical theatrical production that simply used a plain white sheet for its scene changes, which just added to the tension and excitement as the plot unfolded in a rich cultural drama that is taking the world by surprise as young people now realise Sri Lanka is no ordinary island.
As the play twisted and turned, out slithered the snakey Satarnia and off the kids ran, with the rest of the audience running back up the steps after them to meet the mermaid again at the top end of the Anchor bar pool, who was joined by the adorable elephant in the story Donald Trunk, where the finale of the fairy tale took place. Donald then asked the kids if they wanted some of his special cake and off they all went on a merry dance back to the area they began in, which had been reset, while the play was proceeding, by Chef Nihal and his team, with a marvellous tea and incredible Donald Trunk surfing cake. The beach complete with whale was in fact a delicious cake, which was unfurled after the co-owner of Jetwing, Shiromal Cooray, made a very moving and funny speech that taught everyone lots about the wildlife of Sri Lanka and the work that the Jetwing group are doing to protect it for future generations, including the exciting launch of a fascinating frog book The Frogs of the Cloud Forest Nuwara Eliya by their Jetwing St. Andrews naturalist, Ishanda.
As the excitement at the event mounted and the cake needed cutting, Herman Gunaratne, the famous Sri Lankan author, tea maestro and producer of the rarest virgin white tea, took the scissors and told everyone about how the book took shape at Mirissa Hills and why it will be a real winner, owing to it being from a Sri Lankan perspective and had brilliantly focused on the islands most iconic star, the elephant. Together with the butterfly Holly, who had flown in from England they cut the ribbon and the kids cried out in joy as the butterfly un-swirled it to reveal a whale in the sea, sea creatures of all kinds you could eat, the surfing elephant on a Jetwing Lighthouse board with his Daily Tusk reading counterpart sitting in the sand plotting his next escape while watched over by a sea of happy faces.
Questions were then asked by the team to check if the kids had really been listening to the story line and over a hundred prizes were given out, ranging from pink elephant covered pencil cases to water bottles with the images of the exhibition from the book. Everyone chatted over clanking cups of tea, delicious snacks and the Donald Trunk surfing cake, while some of the crowd took selfies with the stars of the show, or looked at the exhibition of original drawings from the book, along the main corridor from the Anchor Bar to the reception area. Many others jumped into the pool to cool down and hang out with the mermaid Bella Donna (known locally as Sharon) or tried to climb the rocks with Donalds naughty monkey who loved stealing buns and bananas from the amazing spread put on by Jetwing Hotels. No one wanted to go home and as the sun set, after many more photos were taken, books with personalised drawings signed by the artist Janet for both the local Mahinda kids and international school were done with splashes of paint and sparkles of glitter thrown over them granting wishes and then everyone trooped out, leaving Donald Trunks friends to relax in the reflected glory of their own biosphere enviro-party under the stars. Now the team is busy getting Donald ready for his big global trip with clothes to fit the different weather conditions, painted instructions written for each traveller on how to look after him and training for any terrain. Donald maybe able to swim across an ocean, but how will he fare climbing Mount Everest in the deep snow, float on an iceberg and catch fish with the King Penguins in Antarctica and survive on British food so he can attend the Royal marriage of Prince Harry and Megan Markle. He is confident that even if the American President does not get an invite, he will and doing so will bring his own kind of Donald Trunk sparkle to Prince Harrys special day!

Auditors services lauded by Minister Amunugama
The invaluable service rendered by auditors to uplift the economic situations in their respective countries was highlighted by Special Assignments Minister, Dr. Sarath Amunugama.
Minister Amunugama made these remarks at a well attended international forum held in Colombo to coincide with the 12th annual Inspection Workshop of the International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators (IFIAR). Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy was the guest of honour.
The three-day seminar which is hosted by the Sri Lanka Accounting and Auditing Standards Monitoring Board (SLAASMB) began on February 20. Over 110 professionals representing Audit regulators from 40 countries attended.
IFIAR was established in 2007 by independent audit regulators from various countries in the world. The objective of forming IFAIR was to share the knowledge of the audit market environment and practical experience of independent audit regulatory activities while providing a platform for dialogue with other international organizations which have interests in enhancing the quality of audit in their respective countries.
Speaking further Dr. Amunugama said as auditors all over the world are performing a yeoman service to prosper their economies the governments too appreciate their duties to the maximum.
Commenting the Sri Lankas security situation, the Minister said after ending the war situation the country has now become the safest country in the South East Asia.
Minister Amunugama further said during the past few decades our financial system was very transparent and therefore auditors should use modern techniques to develop the countrys economic situation.
He said foreign investors are highly impressed with present countrys environment and the Government expects more and more investors in the coming months.
When more investors are coming, our auditors too will have to play a major role. The Minister also requested the foreign delegates to travel all over the country to see the current development activities.

Barclays restores dividend but  fails to hit estimates on profits
Barclays PLC on Thursday reported a below-forecast 10 percent rise in its annual profit for 2017, and pledged to restore its full dividend with a payout of 6.5 pence per share in 2018.
Barclays posted a pretax profit of 3.5 billion pounds for 2017, up from 3.2 billion pounds a year ago but worse than the 4.7 billion pound average of analysts forecasts compiled by the bank.
The bank however kept investors waiting on the fate of its Chief Executive Jes Staley, as he faces a probe by Britains banking regulators over his attempts to unmask a whistleblower who had raised concerns about a Barclays executive.
Investors had hoped Barclays would update them on the status of the regulatory investigation, which the bank announced on April 10 last year.
The bank said it would resume paying its full dividend, which it had slashed by 50 percent in March 2016 in order to provide extra funds to pay for a hefty restructuring that included selling the majority of its stake in Barclays Africa Group. The bank reported an attributable loss of 1.9 billion pounds, thanks to a 2.5 billion pound loss from the Africa sale.
Barclays was the worst-performing bank in the FTSE 100 index in 2017, falling nine percent on investors concerns about both the underperformance of its investment bank, and its host of legal and regulatory troubles. AFP

Barnaby Joyce: Scandal-hit Australia deputy PM to resign

Barnaby Joyce says he will resign as Australia's deputy prime minister following a politically damaging saga that began with his affair with a former staffer.
Joyce said he would step down on Monday as leader of the Nationals, the junior government partner.
Joyce had resisted calls to quit amid questions over whether he had breached ministerial rules.
He called his decision on Friday a "circuit-breaker".
"This current cacophony of issues has to be put aside," he told reporters.
Joyce is perhapsbest-known for once threatening to kill Johnny Depp's dogsover a quarantine violation, and forbriefly losing his job over his New Zealand dual citizenshiplast year.
On Friday, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull thanked Joyce for being "a fierce advocate for rural and regional Australia".
The political scrutiny of Joyce has dominated Australian headlines for more than two weeks.
Last week, Turnbull publicly criticised Joyce's "shocking error of judgement" and saidministers would be banned from having sex with their staff.
Joyce responded by calling Turnbull's comments "inept" and "unnecessary", but insisted the pair could still work together.
On Friday, Joyce again insisted that his relationship with his former media adviser, Vikki Campion, had not resulted in any breaches of standards at the time.
The veteran MP faced scrutiny over the timing of two jobs offered to Campion within his party last year, and whether he sought a gift of free housing from a businessman.
He has also vigorously denied a sexual harassment complaint that was made against him by another woman.

Beehives  in your living room
As you probably know already, the bee population is in a consistent decline and has been for some time, with modern industrial farming methods and loss of habitat being identified causes.
This is bad news for all of us, as bees do the crucial job of pollinating so many of the plants that we rely on for food.
In order to counter this, we have to come up with innovative solutions, as we all know how difficult it is to make huge, moneymaking corporations change their damaging practices. BEEcosystem has created a system of wall-mounted observation hives, that can be easily expanded in a hexagonal, honeycomb style, and even lets you invite the bees into your living room.
This concept, bringing bees closer to humans in an urban environment, is not only good for the bee population as a whole, but it increases the understanding of the importance of bees and their role, as we learn to live side-by-side.
The system has been designed with safety in mind, so that even novice bee-keepers can use it with a peace of mind that few other systems offer. Because yeah, we can understand the trepidation that many people, brought up to fear bees and their sting, might have when sitting next to a few thousand of them on the couch.
You can watch the bees in action as they do their amazing work and build up their colony, see how they create honeycomb and beeswax, and even harvest honey if you are feeling hungry.

D R Wijewardene
You would not be reading this newspaper today if not for the valiant efforts of Don Richard Wijewardene, the founder of the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (ANCL). The fact that this newspaper has disseminated up-to-the-minute news and shaped public opinion for 100 years is a testimony to the sagacity of D R Wijewardene, the undisputed doyen of the newspaper industry in Sri Lanka. Indeed, it would not be incorrect to say that he started a socio-cultural revolution through his newspapers that stood  and still stand for freedom and free expression.
The socio-political milieu in which Wijewardene started a flourishing newspaper empire in the early 1900s is very different from todays political and media landscape. It was a period when Ceylon, as Sri Lanka was known during the colonial period, was struggling to gain independence from England. As prominent personalities joined hands irrespective of any differences to agitate for independence, Wijewardene selected the then nascent medium of the newspaper to take their message to the masses. It was a unique approach at the time.
Wijewardene realized that addressing the local audience through vernacular newspapers alone was not enough - it was essential to drive home the growing force of the independence movement to the colonial administrators. Hence his decision to launch the English-language Daily News in 1918. Not surprisingly, the newspapers he founded and nurtured were in the forefront of the independence movement. No one could ignore the power of the free press at the forefront of the independence movement.
Wijewardene, who refused a knighthood from the British Empire lest it interfere with his quest for freedom for his Motherland, died just two years after Sri Lanka gained independence. But he was contended that his dream of an independent Sri Lanka had come true and proud of the very significant role he played in that long struggle. His name is forever associated with the independence struggle of Sri Lanka. If ever there was an example for the power of the press to shape public discourse and change the very course of history, D.R. Wijewardene and Lake House can be cited without any hesitation.
Before and after gaining independence, Wijewardenes newspapers reflected the public mood and stood for their aspirations. He obtained the services of the best journalists of the time to fulfill this mission. Like Wijewardene himself, they too were committed to telling the truth to the people. They were not afraid to call a spade a spade. His cherished ideals would guide the destiny of the ANCL for many decades to come.
Wijewardene was one of those rare individuals who had journalism in his veins and in his heart. He realized that more media outlets necessarily lead to a more vibrant democracy. He would indeed have been delighted to see his son and nephew enter the newspaper industry, because every new newspaper was yet another voice for the voiceless masses in his opinion.
Today, the times have changed and so has the newspaper industry. This industry now has to compete with television, radio and of course, the Internet and social media. Newspapers have to stay relevant in the age of instant news and sound bites. Newspapers around the world have downsized and some survive only online.
The new media landscape has completely changed the way newspapers work. Having a print edition is no longer adequate  a newspaper has to be on the web with audio and video clips, do podcasts, maintain an app, send mobile news alerts and be active on Twitter and Facebook.
Yet, the newspaper as envisioned by Wijewardene has a much bigger role to play. Even as electronic and online media cover the news in a fleeting way, the newspapers role is to probe in-depth the issues of the day. This primary role has not changed much from the days of Wijewardene. Indeed, the concepts of journalism and good reporting that he espoused will not disappear even if printed newspapers disappear some day in the future.
Todays journalists need some qualities that Wijewardene had in ample measure  courage and conviction. These qualities are needed more than ever in a world where being a journalist has become rather dangerous and sometimes life-threatening. According to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), 65 journalists were killed last year around the globe. While this is the least number of journalists assassinated in 14 years, it is still a huge number. A total of 262 journalists were also jailed in 2017, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). The first lesson in journalism is no story is worth your life but many journalists defy this in the quest for the truth.
The truth was at the heart of Wijewardenes journey in the newspaper industry. He fought falsehoods with facts, dishonesty with honesty and subterfuge with exposure through the ANCL newspapers which continue this tradition to this day. Fearless and relentless in what he did, Wijewardene was a consummate professional who never took no for an answer. There are many lessons that we can draw from his eventful life even today, when we mark his 132nd birth anniversary.

Dialog to power Royal-Thomian Battle of the Blues for twelfth year
The 139th Battle of the Blues between Royal College, Colombo and S. Thomas College, Mt. Lavinia, for the prestigious D. S. Senanayake Memorial Shield, is scheduled to be played at the SSC grounds from March 8-10 with Sri Lankas premier connectivity provider, Dialog Axiata PLC once again coming forward as the official sponsor.
In this years encounter, the boys from Mt. Lavinia will be led by all rounder Delon Peiris, and the lads from Reid Avenue will be under the captaincy of opening batsman Pasindu Sooriyabandara.
The Royal-Thomian has a rich and colourful history of 138 years, and is also the second longest uninterrupted cricket series played in the world; second only to the annual encounter played between St. Peters College, Adelaide and Prince Alfred College, Adelaide, Australia, begun just a year earlier.
In 1880, the first match in which only the boys took part was played on the Galle Face Green, the present-day location of the Taj Samudra Hotel. This was the start to the Centenary series.
Speaking at the media conference held at the Mihilaka Medura, BMICH on Tuesday, S. Thomas College warden Rev.Marc Billimoria said, The Battle of the Blues between S. Thomas College and Royal College two of the leading schools in Sri Lanka, has a long and rich history of tradition and camaraderie spanning over 138 years. The Joint Organizing Committee has worked very hard over the last few months to raise the bar and enhance the fun and excitement for all the Thomians as well as the Royalists both young and old. I am sure both teams will play exhilarating cricket and I wish both schools the best.
But as a Thomian I believe S. Thomas will come out victorious in this years encounter as this is the 100th year for us after we shifted from Mutwal to Mount Lavinia. Finally I would like to thank the management and staff of Dialog Axiata PLC for coming out once again to sponsor this years encounter as well.
Royal College principal B.A. Abeyratne said, The Big Match between our two schools is one of the most looked forward to events in the Sri Lankan sporting calendar and this year will be no exception. I would like to thank the management and staff of Dialog Axiata for their generous gesture to once again sponsor the 139th edition of the annual Battle of the Blues. I wish both schools the very best to deliver three days of positive cricket. As the Royal College principal I would be definitely happy if we can win this years encounter but may the better team win.
The playing fields of the Royal-Thomian has the distinction of producing cricketers who later became eminent heads of state, with S. Thomas producing the father of the nation D. S. Senanayake MP and his son, Dudley Senanayake MP as Prime Ministers of Ceylon, while Royal produced General Sir John Kotelawala MP as Prime Minister and the first Executive President of Sri Lanka, J. R. Jayawardene.
The tally between the two schools at present stands at 35 wins for Royal and 34 wins for S. Thomas with the highly debated famous match in 1885, where Royal College was all out for 9 runs with no play on the second day being considered a win by S. Thomas and a draw by Royal. After the 2016 heroics by the Royal eleven, the shield at present sits as the crown jewel amongst the silverware in the trophy cabinet at Royal College. It will be challenged for possession by the Thomian outfit this year. S. Thomas College last won the big match in 2007 under skipper Ashan Peiris while Royal Colleges last win came under the captaincy of Geeshath Panditharatne in 2016.
In 2015, the 136th edition of the Royal-Thomian, Dialog rekindled a long and successful partnership with Sri Lankas Blue Riband Big Match, The Battle of the Blues. The 139th edition of the Royal-Thomian will be the twelfth year that the match is sponsored by Dialog. Sri Lankas premier connectivity provider, Dialog Axiata has also made a pledge to contribute Rs. 1,000 for every run scored and Rs. 10,000 for every wicket that falls. Last years exciting encounter contributed Rs. 1,036,000 to the Play for a Cause pledge. The proceedings were directed in consultation with the Principal of Royal College and the Warden of S. Thomas College to support and empower selected deserving schools. Since the inception of the Play for a Cause pledge, Rs. 2,959,000 worth of cricket gear was donated to ten deserving schools.

DIG to probe patients fall to death
Panadura Chief Magistrate Chandima Liyanage directed Deputy Inspector General of Police Western Province to hold a comprehensive investigation to find out the cause of death regarding the mysterious death of Wadumenthrige Wasantha Kumara of Wekada Panadura, a patient who had escaped from the Panadura Base Hospital.
His body was found at the foot of a high building situated close to the Panadura South Police on February 20 and police conducted the investigations. The Chief Magistrate resumed the Magisterial inquiry into the death of W. Wasantha Kumara on February 21 in open Court as relatives of him had not been satisfied with the investigations conducted by the Panadura South Police Crime Branch.
When further magisterial inquiry was called before the Court on February 21, Namal Perera Attorney at law appearing for the wife of the deceased informed court that she suspected that the death of her husband is a murder. The police had not conducted a proper inquiry into the death of her husband who escaped from the Panadura Base Hospital on February 19. The wife suspected that when he escaped from the hospital he had come to the Panadura South Police and the policemen on duty at the police station on that night assaulted him and chased him out from the police station. The lawyer produced a CD record before Court.
Panadura South Police Asst Supdt of Police Clayment Fernando who had conducted an inquiry into the allegation of being hammered by policemen on that night, denied that the police had assaulted him on that night when the deceased visited the police. However, the Asst Supdt of Police mentioned in his report submitted to the Police that the policemen on that night had been negligent in carrying out their duty and that action will be taken against them.
Dr. Kumarage, AJMO of Ragama Hospital who had performed the autopsy on W. Wasantha Kumara on the orders of the Panadura Chief Magistrate had submitted his judicial report to Court and informed that there were no assault injuries on the body of the deceased but the injuries had been caused when he fell from a high spot.
Police Sergeant Samanlal Edirisinghe representing the Panadura South Police informed Court that W. Wasantha Kumara had been a patient of the Panadura Base Hospital and on February 19 he had escaped from the hospital and visited the Panadura Police Station and later left. Policemen had asked him to leave the police station. He had then left the Panadura Police Station and on the following day his body was found at the foot of a four storied building situated far from the Panadura South Police.
The Police called on the Chief Magistrate to the scene and conducted the magisterial inquiry. He ordered the Ragama Hospital AJMO to perform the autopsy on the body of the deceased and submit the Judicial Report.

Elected LG members to be gazetted on March 3
The Election Commission will issue the Gazette containing the list of members in each Local Government body on March 3, Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said.
He said Deputy and Assistant Commissioners in their capacity as the returning officers yesterday sent letters to the General Secretaries of the political parties and Leaders of Independent Groups informing the number of members they should appoint for each of the LG body.
Addressing a press conference at the Elections Secretariat in Rajagiriya, Deshapriya said the Commission had requested the list of members at the latest by March 2. He explained even candidates who had lost their seats could be appointed through the list.
The Chairman said adhering to 25 percent quota to female representation is difficult in about 10 LG bodies including Manmuneipattu in Batticaloa
where all the elected candidates are men. In such occasions, we cannot force the parties to stick to 25 percent quota for women, but in the letter we encouraged them to include more women from the list. Some women organizations and people criticised me stating that I try to reduce female representation, but that was not true, he added. However, he pointed out 535 female candidates have been able to win their respective seats. We have elected 5,075 male candidates and 535 female candidates from the First-Past-the-Post system. As a percentage this is more than 10 percent. Against the 1.9 percent female representation prevailed at the LG bodies previously, this is a significant achievement, he noted.
He said overhangs were there in 196 out of 340 LG bodies increasing the total number of members by 364 from 8,325 to 8,689. He said the letters also indicated that any party or independent group which had obtained 50 percent or more in a council could appoint a member of their party or group as the Head. I foresaw some of the problems currently being experienced. When I pointed them out at meetings the authorities told me that I was looking at extremes, he noted.
I WANT A REST - DESHAPRIYA
Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya yesterday expressed his desire to take a rest from his work by assigning his duties to another at least for a short period.
He made this comment winding up a press conference called by him at the Elections Secretariat premises yesterday.
I am seriously thinking as to when I can get rid of this mantle. I want to take at least one month vacation leave.As per the Constitution, I can do so by assigning my duties to another.
I will contemplate on doing so after the relevant Gazette for the Local Authorities is issued.
This is mainly because I feel exhausted after working restlessly over the past months and also feel tired of replying to the media, he said.

31 affiliated members decide today:
Election for Sri Lankas highest post in sport
The much debated National Olympic Committee (NOCSL) election will be held today at the NOCSL headquarters, commencing 6pm to appoint office bearers who will govern the apex sports body for a four-year term. The two main parties headed by presidential candidates Rohan Anthony Fernando and Suresh Subramaniam seek a majority vote to appoint 12 top officials in the NOCSL. It has been a controversial election campaign from the beginning with both parties pointing fingers at each other.
The three-member NOCSL Election Committee headed by Dr. R.M.K. Ratnayaka yesterday put an end to a lot of confusion and controversy involved with the election by deciding that only 31 affiliated members will be eligible to vote at the election. The election committee was appointed by the immediate past president Hemasiri Fernando and included S. Virithamulla and S. Liyanagama as the other members.
The number of eligible votes has been a controversy from the beginning as presidential candidate Rohan's alliance lodged protests against voting eligibility of some federations. They pointed out that Hockey and Badminton federations have been dissolved and functioning under the Director General of Sports, so they should not be allowed to vote. The main controversy was about the eligibility of two votes by the Athletes' Commission. The Athletes Commission was established in 2016 on an International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommendation. Even though the NOCSL constitution allows two votes by the Athletes' Commission, Rohan's alliance protested that the Athletes' Commission has not yet obtained approval from the General Assembly of IOC and ratification from the IOC, which is the legitimate procedure for voting rights.
Considering the protests, the NOCSL Election Committee yesterday cleared the doubts, by allowing the two votes by the Hockey and Badminton federations while not approving the Athletes' Commission's votes. The NOCSL Election Committee further said that only after the IOC ratification and its general Assembly approval, the Athletes' Commission will be allowed to vote at future elections.
As both parties had no objections on the Election Committee's verdict, the IOC representative who will be arriving today will most likely play the role of an IOC supervisor at the election.
Presidential candidate Suresh Subramaniam said that he is very confident of winning the race from the beginning. I have over 25 years of experience in local and international sports administration. I have a good plan to develop sports and I know how to do that properly. I have never tried to influence anyone and never did anything below the belt," he said.
Former NOCSL secretary and secretary candidate from Suresh's alliance Maxwell de Silva emphasized preserving the spirit of sports and serving Sri Lankan sport are his top priorities regardless of winning or losing at the election.
"We never wanted to create problems and not a single objection or protest has been lodged by us. So we hope that we will get the majority," he said. Senaka Clement Ranasinghe is the candidate for the treasurers post from Suresh's side.
The other presidential candidate Rohan Anthony Fernando claims that he will get a clear majority if the member federations want to rescue NOCSL from corruption. "People who are against corruption will vote for my alliance. We are very confident that even under a lot of influence by the other party, the rightful people will support us to take Sri Lankan sports to the next level," he commented.
The secretary candidate from Rohan's side, Rohan Prithiviraj Perera said that he wishes the Election Committee will act neutrally, despite influence attempts by the strong rivals.
"We were subjected to lot of ill treatment and one of our Ex-Co candidates had to withdraw at the last moment due to a trap set by the other party. So we have only 11 candidates in our list. But we hope the sports loving people will give us the mandate today," he said. Shirantha Peries is the treasurer candidate from Rohan's side.

Forensic experts have confirmed that the explosion caused by the detonation of a hand grenade suspected to have been in the possession of an army soldier had caused the fire aboard the private bus in Kahagolla last Wednesday morning.
Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara denied certain media reports that a passenger who had been receiving treatment at the Diyatalawa hospital had run away from the hospital. The release noted that 19 persons including seven civilians had been injured in the explosion and were admitted to the Diyatalawa hospital for treatment. Of them one of the passengers, a resident of Ellagama, who was being treated for shock had been discharged. However prior to that, the police had also recorded a statement from him regarding the incident.
The explosion had occurred around 5.45 on Wednesday morning injuring 19 passengers.
The bus was travelling in the general area of Kahagolla, Diyatalawa at the time of the explosion.
Among the injured were seven Army personnel, seven civilians and five Air Force personnel.
The condition of two Army personnel is reportedly critical.

Far-right conspiracy theorists target shooting survivors
US: In the wake of the Florida school shooting, survivors like David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez have become faces of the fight for US gun control -- and targets for far-right pundits and conspiracy theorists who paint the students as puppets of the political left.
In a polarized climate where the most fervent supporters of President Donald Trump are quick to cry fake news, the students had barely started calling for action to stop mass shootings when wild theories began swirling on the far-right internet.
At the forefront were websites Infowars and The Gateway Pundit -- known for relaying bogus theories including the notion that the shooting of 26 children and teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 was a hoax.
Evidence mounts Florida attack is a giant false flag, ran the title of one video on Infowars.
Gateway Pundit lashed out at string-pullers it said were manipulating the students, in support of a vehemently anti-gun, anti-American, and anti-Trump agenda.
The site namely implicated organizers of the Women's March -- which has voiced support for a student-led gun control march on Washington on March 24.
Hogg, a student journalist and one of the movement's most visible faces, and Gonzalez, who called out Donald Trump over his links to the National Rifle Association in an impassioned televised address last weekend, have been on the receiving end of particularly fierce attacks.
Infowars alleged the pair were coached by CNN -- the cable network regularly assailed by the American right for its supposed liberal bias -- interpreting their ease in front of the camera as evidence they were in reality crisis actors working on behalf of the far left.
Meanwhile, Hogg's father's status as a retired FBI agent -- an organization in Trump's crosshairs over its probe into Russian meddling in his election campaign -- served as further conspiracy fodder.
A YouTube video presenting the theory was the site's most shared footage Tuesday with around 200,000 views -- before it was taken down. Similar allegations were circulating on social media under the hashtags #CrisisActors and #ParklandHoax, triggering immediate calls for the accounts to be blocked.
Still, another Parkland survivor, Cameron Kasky, who launched the movement's rallying cry #NeverAgain, said Wednesday he was suspending his Facebook account after receiving death threats from radical supporters of the National Rifle Association. - AFP

Journalism in Ceylon:
Force for progressive social change
There were of course many influential and profitable newspapers in Ceylon before Wijewardene started the Daily News. There were also outstanding newspaper men who, in their time, wielded considerable power.
Wijewardene was singular in the skilful way in which he brought about the transition from limited circulations to mass production. When he became a newspaper proprietor, readers were to be found mainly in Colombo and the provincial towns. Planters on estates received their papers a day or two after publication. The average daily sale of a paper did not exceed three or four thousand copies. When he died, newspapers were distributed to every nook and corner of the island, carried to their readers by the most modern means of transportation, including the aeroplane. The remarkable increase in literacy together with new methods of production and distribution sent up the circulations of newspapers by leaps and bounds. The Dinamina prints over 70,000 copies a day and the Daily News over 55,000 copies. Wijewardene was in fact fulfilling in Ceylon the same function which Northcliffe had set before himself in England a dozen years earlier.
When the Daily News was started there were in existence in Colombo four other daily newspapers published in English, namely, the Times of Ceylon, the Observer, the Ceylon Morning Leader, and the Ceylon Independent. The Ceylon Observer, which Wijewardene acquired in 1923, and the Times of Ceylon, are now both well over a hundred years old. What may be described as the first newspaper in the island was the Government Gazette, still going strong but so different from the Gazette of old whose contents included obituary notices recounting the virtues of departed ones, poetry of varied merit, and interesting and instructive communications on various subjects. Gradually, however, the publication discarded these embellishments and developed into the dull and prosaic weekly of today.
As the subject of this book was probably the most successful newspaper man produced by Ceylon, the inclusion of a brief history of journalism in the island in the present chapter would not be out of place. The era of newspapers independent of Government began with the arrival of Sir Robert Wilmot Horton as Governor of Ceylon in October 1831. Sir Robert was a politician. He had been an Under Secretary of State in England and had married the beautiful cousin of Lord Byron. It was said of him that he was never happy unless he had a newspaper controversy on his hands.
Within three months of Sir Robert's arrival, the Colombo Journal was published under Government auspices and with the encouragement of the Governor himself. It was printed at the Government Press and edited by Mr. George Lee its Superintendent. Mr. Lee denied, however, that the Journal was a Government paper and that the Governor controlled him as Editor. He claimed that its profits covered expenses. Mr. Lee was assisted in the editorship by Mr. Henry Tuffnell, the Governor's Private Secretary and son-in-law. Sir Robert himself was a frequent contributor to the Journal and signed his articles Timon, Pro Bono Publico and Liber. Another contributor was the Treasurer, George Turnour, the gifted translator of the Mahawamsa. The paper was discontinued from the end of 1833, on the orders of the Government in London, after it had run for two years. The reason given was that the field should be left to private enterprise, but it can scarcely be doubted that the Journal's severe criticism of the authorities in London had more to do with the decision.
However, the field of private enterprise was soon occupied, as there was a clear demand for a free newspaper. The merchants of Colombo, Mr. G. Ackland and Mr. E. J. Darley among them, combined to start The Observer and Commercial Advertiser, which made its first appearance on the 4th February 1834. It is the newspaper which Wijewardene bought nearly 90 years later.
Birth of the Colombo Observer
Colonel H. C. Byrde has described the state of expectation at the time: I can well remember discussions in the Fort, for I had become associated with Messrs. G. Boyd, Ackland and others, and there were speculations as to getting up an exponent of public opinion, and how it was to be done, and who was to pay for it, and who would be Editor, and if it was likely to pay, all of which resulted in the birth of the Colombo Observer under the editorship of the late Dr. Christopher Elliott who was, prior to this, stationed at Badulla as Assistant Colonial Surgeon, which appointed he resigned to come to Colombo.
The new paper introduced itself to the public thus: The first number is furnished gratis, inviting those who are inclined to favour a free Press to become subscribers.... at 12 shillings a quarter. We appear before a public, fully aware of the difficulties we have to encounter, and from who we hope for every indulgence, encouragement and support....
Although we apprehend our type will not be the most pleasing to the sight just now, we trust ere long in that respect at least our paper will vie with any of its contemporaries. For the present we have availed ourselves of such material as could be spared by Government and a Missionary Society, who have kindly afforded what assistance we have required to enable us to commence at so early a period.
The Observer attacked Sir Robert Wilmot Horton's Government so relentlessly that a defence of the Administration was felt to be necessary. On the 3rd May 1837 appeared the first issue of the Ceylon Chronicle which was privately aided by the Governor and professedly conducted by a Committee of Gentlemen - the gentlemen being mainly of the Ceylon Civil Service. It was edited by the Rev. Samuel Owen Glenie, the Colonial Chaplain of St. Paul's and afterwards Archdeacon of Colombo; but the Bishop objected to this partnership and Mr. Glenie retired, to be succeeded by Mr. George Lee who was now Postmaster-General. The Governor, as well as other members of the Service, contributed to the Chronicle. On the other side, in sympathy with the Observer, were Serjeant Rough, Chief Justice, and Mr. H. A. Marshall, Auditor-General. On the 3rd September 1838, the new paper folded up.
Probably the arrival of the new Governor had something to do with the discontinuance. On the 7th November, 1837, the Right Hon. J. A. Stewart Mackenzie became Governor, and with him came, Mr. A. M. Ferguson, who was destined to play so large a part in the history of the Observer. Mr. Ferguson began writing to the Observer at once and the paper became a supporter of the Government. But the disappearance of the Chronicle did not mean that there was an end of opposition to the older papers. The types and printing presses of the Chronicle were sold to Mr. Mackenzie Ross who, on the 7th September, 1838, started the Ceylon Herald (not to be confused with the Kandy Herald of thirty years later). The new paper was a violent opponent of the Governor and the Herald went so far as to impute to him the intention of acquiring large tracts of land at nominal prices. Ross was tried for libel before Sir Anthony Oliphant and a British Jury but was acquitted.
In 1842 the Herald was taken over by Mr. James Laing, Deputy Postmaster at Kandy, who supported the Government. It then passed on to Dr. McKirdy, on whose death it devolved on the Secretary of the District Court. Mr. W. Knighton, who wrote two books on Ceylon, became Editor. In July 1846 it was bought for Sterling Pound 450 by a group of persons who had decided to start a new paper to oppose the Observer. Thus arose the Ceylon Times, now the Times of Ceylon, the first issue of which was published on the 11th of July 1846.
The greatest days of the newspaper were perhaps, those under the Cappers. John Capper had come out to Ceylon to join the firm of Acland and Boyd and became a junior partner in the year 1847 when it had to suspend payments. He left for England in 1851 and joined the London newspaper Globe as sub-editor. He was back in Ceylon in 1858 and acquired the Ceylon Times of which he became editor. In 1874 he sold the property to a limited company, which was not a success, and on its failure, John Capper again became the proprietor on the property reverting to him as mortgagee. Thereafter the paper was a great success. In 1946 it changed hands and was bought by a syndicate for a sum of about Rs. 7 Million.
In 1858, a new Civil Medical Department was formed by the Government with Dr. Christopher Elliott as the first Principal Civil Medical Officer. This involved his severing his connection with the Observer, A. M. Ferguson, who as mentioned already, had arrived in Ceylon as Private Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Stewart Mackenzie, had joined the paper as sub-editor in 1946 and assumed a major share of responsibility in its production. When Dr. Elliott gave up the editorship, Ferguson bought the newspaper. He was joined in 1861 by his nephew John as Assistant Editor and reporter.
For nearly fifty years A. M. Ferguson dominated public opinion in the island. He won the admiration even of his opponents by the fearlessness and vigour with which he conducted the policy of his paper. Among his pet aversions was a fellow Scotsman, Judge Berwick. Berwick was promoted to the Supreme Court and in his new capacity he presided at a session at Kurunegala. There, in trying a man for bigamy, he held that there was no marriage contract as the formula had run: Will you have this man for your lawful husband, when it should have been: Do you have this man as your lawful husband There was no doubt that Berwick was wrong. Ferguson got hold of this and wrote that they could not have such a man as a Judge of the Supreme Court and that he should be removed immediately.
The Governor asked the Attorney-General to state a case against the Editor and send it to the Judges of the Supreme Court for their opinion where Berwick was right in his view that there was no marriage. The Judges held against their colleague. The Observer was jubilant and demanded that Berwick should revert to the lower court to dispense justice there. Berwick once attended a Fancy Dress Ball in the attire of a Gentleman of the Nineteenth Century. The Observer commented that the disguise was perfect.
Scholar and fine writer
Mr. A. M. Ferguson's younger son, Donald William, was for some years on the staff of the Observer. He was a scholar and fine writer on historical topics. His contributions were of such importance that a weekly supplement was issued gratis from August 1886 in which were published papers bearing on the past history or development of Ceylon, or concise essays on topics bearing on modern local progress. No student of Ceylon history can afford to do without the volumes of the Literary Register which Donald Ferguson edited. He returned to Scotland in 1983 and died there in 1910.
John Ferguson's connection with the Observer lasted for fifty-five years. He was a prolific writer on a variety of subjects and was for a time a member of the Ceylon Legislative Council. His son, R. H. Ferguson, was not a chip of the old block and did not make a success of his editorship. He sold the paper to a syndicate of members of the European Association who in turn sold it to D. R. Wijewardene in 1923.
The Examiner was first published on the 7th September 1846 with Mr. Bessell as Editor and Mr. John Capper as chief contributor. It was started by a few British merchants as a mercantile organ and was sold a few years later to Mr. R. E. Lewis of the firm of Parlett, O Halloran and Co. Then it passed into the hands of a group of lawyers with C. A. Lorenz at their head. They included Mr. (later Sir Harry) Dias, Jaems D Alwis, C. L. Ferdinands and J. R. Dunuwille. In a letter to his friend and colleague at the Bar, Richard Lorgan, Lorenz wrote: I have purchased the Examiner from John Selby and placed it in the hands of Louis Nell. If, as I hope, we succeed in keeping up the thing, Fred, Louis and myself being a sufficiently strong staff for the purpose, we shall prove after all that Ceylon has arrived at a position when her children can speak out for themselves, and that in doing so they can exercise the moderation which even English journalists have failed to observe. The paper was powerful and was influential so long as Lorenz was Editor. In 1870 ill-health compelled him to withdraw his active supervision of it and Leopold Ludovici took over the editorship. He was followed by Francis Beven. The paper ceased publication in 1900. Sir Thomas de Sampayo presented a full set of the files of the Examiner to D. R. Wijewardene.
In 1868, a bi-weekly newspaper, the Kandy Herald, was started by some planters. It was printed in Colombo in the offices of the Times of Ceylon, and Richard Morgan used frequently with heavy step to mount the staircase in the Colombo office to dictate an article in defence of Government policy. An early number contained the confidential despatch sent to the Secretary of State by Governor Sir Hercules Robinson on the petition sent to Her Majesty's Government by George Wall and other members of the famous Ceylon League. It was a bitter attack on the planters who were depicted as selfishly bent on securing for themselves the control of the finances of the Colony. The unauthorised publication caused a stir in England. Questions were asked in the House of Commons and the Colonial Office was said to have been worried about it. But the Secretary of State, the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, whose attention was drawn to it, laughed away the episode by saying that such indiscretions were not unknown in England.
Sir Richard Morgan, Queen's Advocate, was a member of both the Executive and Legislative Councils and the most powerful person in Ceylon next to the Governor himself. There is an entry in his diary which reads: I mean to write a series of articles for the Lakrivikirana (a native newspaper with a large circulation) likely to prove essential to the natives: Vaccination, cattle disease, labour on coffee estates, irrigation, etc.
Sir Richard was also interested, towards the end of his life, in a journalistic project for the benefit of his younger son. He intended calling the paper, the Weekly Serendib. The prospectus, found among his papers, stated that:
The Weekly Serendib desires in no way to interfere with the other papers. Its aims are different; its efforts will take another direction. The advancement of the natives is its great object.
It were vain to try to emulate the Observer, with its long and varied experience, its inexhaustible resources, stern firmness and unbending consistency. It has been charged with disregard to the feelings of others, but all this proceeds from earnest convictions
The Ceylon Times is, and will long remain, the great commercial organ, a work to which it devotes itself with singular ability, and for which its Editors extensive experience and its close and careful study of local subjects eminently befits it
The Examiner has our best sympathy. None can withhold sympathy from anything with which Charles Lorenz is connected
The Weekly Serendib never saw the light, although arrangements were well advanced for its publication.
The Ceylon Independent had as its first editor George Wall. He had founded a Planters Association of Ceylon and played a leading part in the agitation for a more representative form of government. He suffered serious losses during the coffee crash and turned to journalism until he was able to put his affairs in some order. The paper eventually passed into the hands of Sir Hector Van Cuylenburg, Burgher member of the Legislative Council. For some years the Rev. (late Canon) G. B. Ekanayake wrote the important leading articles of the paper. At a still later period it was edited by the distinguished schoolmaster and historian, L. E. Blaze.
The Ceylon Standard was started in 1980 by a group of wealthy Sinhalese. A large amount of money was sunk in the project and an editor and sub-editor recruited from England. Mr. Windus, the editor, died shortly after his arrival and Mr. Wayman, the sub-editor left for Australia. The company went into liquidation and the Morning Leader, owned by members of the de Soysa family, rose on its ashes. The ownership of the Morning Leader later passed to a syndicate consisting of Mr. Charles Peiris, brother of Sir James Peiris, Mr. C. E. A. Dias and Mr. W. A. de Silva. In its last phase it was under the sole ownership of Mr. De Silva.
Academic career
The Morning Leader was a power in the land so long as it was edited by Armand de Souza, father of Tori de Souza, editor-in-chief of the Times of Ceylon, and of Senator Doric de Souza of the Ceylon University. De Souza had an unfailing source of reliable information in Sir Marcus Fernando, for long the eminencegirse of the Governor's Executive Council. So long as his brothers-in-law, the de Soysas, owned the paper, Sir Marcus was able to influence it policy but when it went under new ownership he lost interest in it. After de Souzas death, at the early age of 47, the paper was edited for a short time by D.L.C. Rodrigo, fresh from Oxford and the London School of Journalism. Wijewardene had intentions of taking him on to his staff but when the editorial chair of the Morning Leader became vacant Rodrigo accepted an offer to occupy it. Not long after he decided that teaching classics was a more congenial calling than churning out editorials and started an academic career which culminated in the Professorship at the University which he held for many years with great distinction. Wijewardene in due course bought the Independent and put the Morning Leader out of business.
The Sinhalese Press had a creditable record. Mention has already been made of the Lakrivikirana, to which Sir Richard Morgan proposed to contribute a series of articles. One of the earliest Sinhalese papers was the Lakminipahana, first public in 1865. The Sarasavisandarasa, which was started by the Buddhist Theosophical Society, had, as its Editor, Pandit Weeragama Bandara who, in the words of Mr. W.A. de Silva, brought a new spirit into Sinhalese writing. He introduced a fine style, elegant and popular, which created a new era in Sinhalese prose composition.
Two other Sinhalese newspapers which were popular at this time were the Sinhala Baudhaya and the Sinhala Jatiya. The latter was edited by Mr. Piyadasa Sirisena, a well-known publicist of his day.
H.S. Perera, a resourceful member of the staff of the Sarasavisandarasa, founded the Dinamina towards the end of his life. It was bought by D.R. Wijewardene and his brother D.C.  their first newspaper venture jointly or separately. They did so on the advice of D.B. Jayatilaka who by his well-informed articles and personal prestige helped to make it the most influential Sinhalese daily newspaper. Since then there have been several other Sinhalese newspapers, notably the Silumina and Janata, both published by Lake House, the Lankadipa published by the Times group, the Lakmina and the Swadesha Mitraya. The last-named was founded and edited by D.W. Wickremaratchi, who rendered yeoman service to Wijewardenes Dinamina as Editor and Manager for some years.
The most widely read Tamil newspapers in Ceylon today are the Virakesari and the Thinakaran. Many Tamil newspapers with a more limited circulation have been published in Jaffna, but none f them has been great commercial success although they have played an important part in the social and political life of the Tamils.
The first attempt at journalism in Jaffna was made in 1841, five years before the Examiner and Ceylon Times appeared, when the Morning Star, a bi-monthly Tamil journal, was launched under the editorship of Henry Martyn. The Catholic Guardian was started in 1876. Other newspapers published in Jaffna from time to time included the Ceylon Patriot, the Jaffna Freeman and the Hindu Organ. Batticaloa published a paper called The Lamp.
The Catholic Messenger, published in Colombo, has had a distinguished career and has never been more vigorous than it is today.

Garment export earnings to EU up by 27.2 % YoY
Sri Lankas external sector performance continued to improve in the month of December 2017, mainly with higher inflows to the Financial Account of the Balance of Payments (BOP).
Although earnings from exports increased at a higher rate, the increase in import expenditure resulted in widening the trade deficit in December 2017.
Continued inflows by way of tourist earnings and workers remittances, however, have contributed in curtailing the expanded trade deficit to a certain extent. Improvement in short-term and long-term capital inflows continued during the month. Reflecting the favourable developments in the external sector, the BOP recorded a surplus of US dollars 2,068 million in 2017, while gross official reserves of the country stood at US dollars 8.0 billion as at end 2017. Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 2 per cent during 2017.
Earnings from exports surpassed US dollars 1 billion mark in December 2017 for the fifth time during the year and recorded a double-digit growth (year-on-year) for the sixth consecutive month.
Increased performance in industrial exports supported by textiles and garments largely contributed to this growth.
Recording the highest value for the year, earnings from textiles and garment exports continued to increase significantly in December 2017 with increased exports to the European Union (EU) following the restoration of the GSP+ facility in May 2017.
Earnings from garment exports to the EU increased by 27.2 per cent (year-on-year), while garment exports to the USA and other non-traditional markets increased by 18 per cent and 14.1 per cent, respectively, during December 2017.
Further, due to the combined effect of higher volumes and prices of bunker and aviation fuel, exports earnings of petroleum products increased significantly in December 2017.
Further, earnings from rubber products increased during the month mainly due to the export of tyres. In addition, export earnings from food, beverages and tobacco increased considerably in December 2017 owing to higher earnings from exports of vegetable, fruit and nuts preparations.Meanwhile, with the increase in the average export prices and volumes, earnings from tea increased in December 2017 favourably impacting agricultural exports. Earnings from seafood and minor agricultural products, particularly fruits and betel leaves also contributed towards the enhanced export earnings.
On a cumulative basis, export earnings recorded the historically highest value of US dollars 11.4 billion in 2017 mainly due to the notable increase in tea, textiles and garments, and petroleum products exports. In addition, spices and seafood exports also contributed towards the increase in exports during 2017. Nevertheless, earnings from gems, diamonds and jewellery, leather, travel goods and footwear and coconut declined during the year.
The leading markets for merchandise exports of Sri Lanka during 2017 were the USA (25.6 per cent), the UK (9.1 per cent), India (6.1 per cent), Germany (4.7 per cent) and Italy (4.7 per cent) accounting for about 50 per cent of total exports. Earnings from tourism and workers remittances were the main inflows to the external current account followed by the proceeds of merchandise exports. With December recording the highest number of tourists in a given month for the year 2017, earnings from tourism increased to US dollars 419.5 million1. Accounting for 51.2 per cent of total tourist arrivals for 2017, India, China, the UK, Germany and France continued to be the top five sources of tourist arrivals. For 2017, earnings from tourism are provisionally estimated to be an increase of 3.2 per cent to US dollars 3,631 million.
Workers remittances declined by 1.9 per cent to US dollars 671 million in December 2017. On a cumulative basis, inflows on account of workers remittances declined by 1.1 per cent year-on-year to US dollars 7,164 million2 in 2017 reflecting the geo-political uncertainties and the continuation of subdued economic performance in the major remittance generating destinations. Foreign investments to the government securities market witnessed a net inflow for the tenth consecutive month. Foreign investments in the CSE also recorded a net inflow for the month of December and for the year 2017. However, as repayment of foreign loans outweighed inflows, government long-term loans (net) recorded a year-on-year decline in the month of December as well as for the whole year 2017.
The gross official reserves of the country reached US dollars 8.0 billion (equivalent to 4.6 months of imports) by end 2017 compared to US dollars 6.0 billion recorded at end 2016. Total foreign assets, which include foreign assets of the banking sector, also increased to US dollars 10.4 billion (equivalent to 6.0 months of imports) as at end 2017 from US dollars 8.4 billion recorded as at end 2016.
Workers remittances decline by 1.9 % in Dec-17
Workers remittances declined by 1.9 per cent to US dollars 671 million in December 2017.
On a cumulative basis, inflows on account of workers remittances declined by 1.1 per cent year-on-year to US dollars 7,164 million in 2017 reflecting the geo-political uncertainties and the continuation of subdued economic performance in the major remittance generating destinations.

GIT to showcase unique Thai jewelry at Bangkok Gems & Jewelry Fair
The Gem and Jewelry Institute of Thailand (GIT) has announced the launch of Inheritance and Identities, a project aimed at highlighting the countrys community gem and jewelry industry.
Duangkamol Jiambutr, Director of GIT, said, This is one of our key projects in 2018. Our main objectives are to enhance the capability of the workforce in the gem and jewelry industry, and help them develop the products to meet market needs.
We also expect to create awareness of gem and jewelry products from local communities among tourists and jewelry lovers from every corner of the world. From the beginning of the project, GITs team has targeted local communities in several provinces throughout Thailand.
Dan Kwian, a sub-district in Nakhon Ratchasima province, was our first target, Jiambutr said. GITs experts have worked with the villagers to modernize the design of their ceramic jewelry, while preserving its uniqueness. We hope the new design will help them increase their consumer base. In addition to design development, the GIT will focus on marketing the jewelry products through cooperating with partners to expand distribution channels.
We have displayed and sold gems and jewelry products at GIT shops. Moreover, the GIT, in collaboration with the Department of International Trade Promotion (DITP) and the Department of Business Development (DBD) has found new online and offline distribution channels, the GIT director adds. We expect to see local artisans sell more jewelry and increase their income. This project not only helps create jobs and generate income in local communities, but also helps preserve the heritage of valuable Thai craftsmanship, Jiambutr said.

GMOA welcomes govts SAITM decision
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) welcomes the decision made by the Government to admit qualified SAITM students to the Medical Faculty of the Kotelawala Defence University, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday evening, he said that this is what the GMOA demanded from the beginning and it is good that President Maithripala Sirisena made the decision at least after a long delay. The GMOA will extend its fullest cooperation towards implementing the decision made by the government.
The GMOA is not celebrating the victory and the SAITM issue is not over yet. This is not the right time to celebrate the victory. The Government should issue the gazette notification immediately on abolishing SAITM and declare the process of solving the issue. There are many things to do in connection with admitting qualified students to the KDU, he said.
Earlier SAITM owner Dr. Neville Fernando said he was willing to offer his hospital buildings to a charity. He can hand over them to a state university such as the Moratuwa University for the benefit of students, he added.

JLanka partners with Construction Expo 2018 as Silver sponsor
Bringing together suppliers and service organizations in the building, construction, engineering and architecture industry, the Construction Expo will be held on June 29, 30 and July 1, 2018 at the BMICH.
Held for the 7th consecutive year, the expo will once again showcase the best of what the industry has to offer. Highlighting the theme Towards a Green Sri Lanka, Construction Expo 2018 focuses on the green building evolution that is a fast evolving area of building practice.
Organized and managed by Lanka Exhibition and Conference Services (Pvt) Ltd in collaboration with the Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB), organizers hope it would be the platform in which the future development of the industry would take place.
The event is endorsed by the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development and the construction fraternity as the premier construction and building materials exhibition to be staged in Sri Lanka. Visitors include professionals, key decision makers, buyers, suppliers, traders, distributors and much more.
This year more than 20,000 to 25,000 visitors are expected at the exhibition, this would benefit all stakeholders including contractors, architects, quantity surveyors, engineers and other related parties in the sector.
JLanka join hands with Construction Expo 2018 as a Silver sponsor. Sri Lankas strategic geo-political placement in the world map has not yet been capitalized from the industries that country could thrive and position to its full potential by Sri Lankans over the last 70 years since independence, from the colonial rule.
However a relatively young Solar PV system installer which began operations in 2010 is transforming Sri Lanka into a Solar Powered Energy hub with the most number of installed Solar PV Housing units and with the most innovative technologies that cater industrial Solar power requirements.
Sri Lankas pioneer and leader in Solar PV Systems and Next Generation Energy Technologies - JLanka Technologies from 2010 to date had installed thousands of solar installations throughout the country. All those Solar PV systems generates over 25MW of electricity, with an annual contribution of 37GWh of energy to the national grid.
Being the premier solar solutions provider in the country with a longstanding reputation for quality and unmatched service in the industry, JLanka Technologies has maintained close trade relationships with global solar industry giants such as Trina Solar, SolarEdge over the last seven years.
JLankas commitment to Research and Development on optimizing the home rooftop Solar PV systems in order to maximize Solar Power generation, and intelligent smart Solar Grids, and Energy Management Software and Metering has paved way for many Sri Lankans to consider JLanka Solar PV systems to light their homes and companies
Being a Solar Energy domestic industry giant in a tropical country located close to equator, JLanka also aims to explore the potential of building Solar Energy farms and Solar Plants using the Sunlight that falls in abundance to the Sri Lankan land masses throughout the year.
According to JLanka officials Sri Lanka has a larger potential in the booming solar market and they along with industry partners are committed to help and support with their technologies in providing quality solar products to both households and industrial sectors.
Construction Expo 2018 will be a one of a kind event with almost every stakeholder related to the industry being present. The consumers have grown to look at the exhibition as a one stop shop for all their construction needs and over the years the exhibition has seen thousands of consumers make all purchases, inquiries and other related work during the three days of the show satisfying all their construction related needs under one roof.
A 50-member high-profile delegation, led by the Business Department of Liaoning Province and Shenyang Zhongqiao International Exhibition Co. Ltd, will arrive in Colombo to attend Construction Expo 2018, scheduled to be held at BMICH.

Disappearance of 11 youth:
Magistrate rules:CID should remain in the probe
The Colombo Fort Magistrates Court yesterday rejected a request made by the defence that investigations pertaining to former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P. Dassanayake and nine others be transferred from CID to any other police station.
Making an order in this regard Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne announced that a decision to transfer a police investigation from one police unit to another is vested with an Assistant Superintendent of Police or any other higher ranking police officer.
In this case, former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P. Dassanayake and nine others are accused of aiding and abetting the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009.
Meanwhile, the Magistrate issued an order directing Rear Admiral Ananda Guruge to be present before CID on March 5 to make a statement regarding the investigations into disappearance of youths.
The defence had made an application to change the investigative agency; namely, CID and transfer the investigation to any other Police Station.
Defence counsel submitted to court that there were contradictions in the statements recorded and the CID is acting partially against the Navy Officers. Filing written submissions against defences request, Counsel Achala Seneviratne appearing for the aggrieved party informed court that there is no ground to transfer the inquiry out of the CID.
The written submissions further stated that the Navy continuously obstructed the investigations, but thanks to the professionalism and independence shown by the CID to withstand pressure, the investigations progressed successfully. Two remanded suspects were ordered to be further remanded till March 8.
The missing persons had been abducted by an unidentified group at Dehiwala, Battaramulla and Wattala in 2008 and 2009.

Negative rati Negative rating for Pinnawala ng for Pinnawala
A recent research paper has found the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage to be among the lowest-rated elephant conservation establishments in Asia among visitors.
Sri Jayawardenapura University Researchers T. G. Supun Prakash and Priyan Perera, together with conservationists Chethika Perera and Prithiviraj Fernando who conducted the research, looked at the five ex-situ establishments of Elephant Nature Park in Thailand, Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage in Sri Lanka, Elephant Safari Park in Indonesia, Hutsadin Elephant Foundation in Thailand, and the National Elephant Conservation Centre in Malaysia for their research.
These places were chosen for having received the highest number of reviews on TripAdvisor from August 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017.
The research published in Gajah, the bi-annual journal of the International Union for Conservation of Nature/Species Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC) Asian Elephant Specialist Group (AsESG), observed 10 reasons for dissatisfaction among visitors to these places.
Among these criteria, Pinnawala received the highest number of negative reviews and the second highest number of reviews. The greatest concern among visitors at Pinnawala was the unethical treatment of elephants such as physical harassment, chaining and caging of elephants, elephant performances, and elephant rides. Further, strong objections were also levelled against misbehaviours of mahouts such as asking for bribes, not wearing uniforms, smoking tobacco close to the elephants, excessive use of mobile phones, compelling elephants to pose with tourists for photographs and to eat food given by tourists, and offering ivory products for sale during elephant rides.
All five establishments used the words conservation, nature, and orphanage in advertising. Therefore, it appears that they were aware of current perceptions and expectations of visitors and made use of it to promote the establishment. However, the high proportion of reviews pointing out the deficiency of these aspects suggests that these establishments are lacking in them. Therefore, managers should pay more attention to ensuring animal welfare, and the establishments should engage in applied conservation of elephants, in accordance with their stated objectives, researchers said.
A clear expression of what facilities and types of activities are available at each establishment in information provided especially online, would decrease unrealistic expectations. Misbehaviour of mahouts and exploitation of visitors are problems whose correction is comparatively easy and less costly. Their prevalence suggests lack of vision and effectiveness of management, they added.
Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage Assistant Director Navodh Abeysinge, speaking to the Daily News however, said it was unfair to go by TripAdvisor ratings, as the research had not only taken average ratings to be counted as a negative review, but also that its findings in from August, 2016 to January, 2017, was too outdated in a constantly changing visitor environment.
The other places they compared with Pinnawala were elephant facilities mostly run for commercial gain. We cannot do that because we are an orphanage, so the comparison is not fair, added Abeysinghe.
In addition, keeping with the Born Free, Kept Free concept, Pinnawala, which spreads over 26 acres, was looking to open up roaming space for elephants to 15 acres, from the current nine. With regard to complaints that the elephants were chained, the assistant director said they had kept a semi-wild herd with a few aggressive males. Thus, it was necessary to chain some for visitor, keeper and animal safety.
In terms of touting complaints from mahouts, he said that they had taken steps to significantly reduce such complaints and introduced more discipline among mahouts; We cannot assure 100 percent that they all are perfect, but the complaints we receive has reduced considerably, he said.
Abeysinghe added that their actions had led to better reviews on TripAdvisor over the last year.

Nestl delivers Rs 3.6 bn  net profit in 2017
Nestl has delivered revenue of Rs. 37.6 billion (up 3.1% over 2016) and a net profit of Rs. 3.6 billion for the full year ending December 31, 2017.
Revenue for the fourth quarter was Rs. 10 billion (up 15.6% over Q4 2016) with a net profit of Rs. 1.2 billion. The severe drought and floods, resulting in weak consumer confidence and decline in consumer demand, adversely impacted results. Growth rates were further eroded by an increase in value added tax, which coupled with unprecedented increase in coconut prices, had a negative impact on profit. Enhanced cost saving measures and a focus on driving efficiencies across the value chain helped in partly mitigating these impacts.
The companys contribution to the exchequer as taxes in 2017 was Rs. 6.5 billion.
Continuing to believe in the long term prospects of the Sri Lankan market, Nestl initiated an investment of around Rs. 5 billion in early 2017, to expand production capacity for dairy and coconut based products, which will be funded through a judicious combination of internal accruals and borrowings.
The Board approved an interim dividend of Rs. 25 per share on February 22, 2018 and proposed a final dividend of Rs. 25 per share for the full year, to be approved at the companys Annual General Meeting on May 4, 2018.

Legal experts advice:
No legal snag for Unity Govt. - Speaker
Legal experts had advised that there was no issue with the continuation of the Unity Government when the related parties, have expressed their willingness to continue, observed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in Parliament yesterday.
He said he was advised that it was required to submit a written agreement to ensure the legitimacy of the said government.
He added however, that he would look into the matter again to decide if the two parties of the Unity Government are required to fulfill further legal formalities.
The Speaker made these observations yesterday, in response to Joint Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardenas question challenging the validity of the Unity Government in the House.
The Speaker also pointed out that since the matter was taken up on Wednesday too, and the relevant parties had already expressed their views, there was no point in dwelling on the same matter repeatedly.
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardene moving the motion said that the UPFA is a coalition of a number of parties.
He added that when a Unity Government is formed between the UNP and one of the parties of the UPFA, according to the Constitution, it was mandatory to submit the said written agreement before Parliament.
MP Gunawardene added that such a document has not been submitted before Parliament so far. He also added that such a Unity Government is valid, provided that such a document is presented in the House.
Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella further said that the same matter was answered by the Prime Minister and the Secretary General of the UPFA on Wednesday stating that there was a Unity Government in existence.
So there is a Unity Government, Minister Kiriella said, adding, So it is not fair to bring up the same point over and over again.
Joint Opposition MP Dallas Allhapperuma said the issue pertaining to the Unity Government is a Constitutional one going beyond being a political matter or a social matter. He added that the relevant parties had answered only the political matter and not the constitutional aspect of the issue. He also added that to solve the Constitutional matter, the Speaker should use his rights under the Right to Information Bill and get the agreement before Parliament.
JVP Parliamentarian Nalinda Jayatissa joined the debate and said the copy of the agreement should be submitted before the House.
Deputy Minister Karu Paranawithana said that the matter was not Constitutional but totally political. He added that the UPFA and the Joint Opposition members should decide where they stand and then the issue would be solved.
He also said that there was no point in wasting time raising the same issue everyday, when the National Government is functioning.

PAFFREL to take legal action against candidates who flouted election laws
The Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) is to file legal action against the candidates who seriously breached Election laws at the recently concluded Local Authorities Elections.
PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi told the Daily News that they had identified 15 such candidates in the first round of information gathering.
The candidates who bribed the voters are among them. All of them are from the main parties. However, we need to collect concrete evidence before filing cases and at times the people hesitate to come out and give evidence, he said.
Commenting on the list of 80 corrupt candidates in the fray at the previous elections as identified by PAFFEREL, he said the majority had been defeated, but about 10 such candidates had won while two of them had also been nominated as Heads of the LG bodies.
All of them represent the main parties and we decided to write to the General Secretaries of those parties urging not to appoint them as Heads of those respective LG bodies, he said.
He also regretted that the Bill on Campaign Finance Upper Limitation for Elections, which the PAFFREL took the initiation to draft, and handed over to the Government in August last year was not proceeded with thereafter. He said the Election watchdog groups have decided to collectively pressure the Government to adopt the legislation before the forthcoming Provincial Council Elections.

Parliament has to approve delimitation report on PCs with two thirds majority: Deshapriya
The delimitation report on the Provincial Councils has to be approved by Parliament with two thirds majority, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said.
Responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at the Elections Secretariat yesterday, Deshapriya said Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha, to whom the delimitation report was submitted last Monday, has to present it to Parliament.
He said if it did not receive the two thirds majority support, then the Prime Minister should appoint a special commission to look into it and re-submit the report. Deshapriya told the media that he could not exactly say when the Provincial Council Elections would be held because this procedure is yet to be completed.
He said that in addition to the Eastern, North Central and Sabaragamuwa PCs, for which elections are already due, the term of three more PCs namely the Central, Northern and North Western PCs would also end by next September. He said it would be better if the PC elections are conducted at least by September. Postponing elections is against the franchise and supremacy of the people, he said.
He pointed out that the Local Authorities, being a devolved subject coming under the Provincial Councils, can hardly function when PCs are not operative.
He noted as per the recent Amendments made to the Provincial Councils Act, the mix member proportional system would apply to the Provincial Council Elections too. The 60:40 ratio of the First-Past-the-Post and Proportional Representation that applied to LG elections will change to 50:50 ratio at the PC elections. The overhang will be less unless any party claims a sweeping victory at the elections, he added.
Replying to the questions by the media, Deshapriya said that going back to the old electoral system is impossible unless Parliament amends the relevant Act again.
He also reminded both President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa explicitly stated in their manifestos that a new electoral system would be introduced based on the mix member proportional system and that the people have given a mandate for that.
Therefore, there is a question whether the people would like to go back to the preferential votes system. It is up to Parliament to decide on the legislation. The stability does not matter much in a democracy. If any mix member proportional system to work well, bonus seats and cut off points are necessary, he said.

Prof. Warnapala: Epitome of honesty and integrity: President
President Maithripala Sirisena said former national list parliamentarian Prof. Vishva Warnapala was a politician who repudiated corruption.
Moving the condolence motion of Prof. Vishva Warnapala in Parliament yesterday, the President said that at a time when politician and corruption goes hand in hand, the Professor was an epitome of honesty and integrity and an example to be followed.
In carrying out responsibilities entrusted to him, he never came under criticism by anyone who worked with him for having flouted his duties nor was he ever implicated in any fraudulent or corrupt activity. He held many positions throughout his career, and carried out his duties meticulously.
He was not only an intelligent and educated person but was also most noted for his honesty. I constantly wonder if such an educated, honest and committed man ever got the rightful recognition and place in our society and even the governments he served in, the President noted.
He said it was regretful that such an educated, knowledgeable and honest politician was not recognised and given a far greater role in this country, which was an issue the President had raised on many occasions.
In spite of his vast knowledge and academic achievements, he never lost his humanity and compassion. He was an MP of this Parliament and Deputy Minister. but apart from that, his service rendered locally and internationally should be recognised and appreciated. Having hailed from a normal family, he never lost his humbleness despite his achievements. It is a privilege indeed to have at least such an opportunity as this, to speak of an exceptional human being as Prof. Vishva Warnapala, the President said.
President Sirisena while offering his condolences to the family of the late Prof. Warnapala, said his life and qualities should serve as a great example that all should follow.
MP Aelian Nanayakkara rendered great service for Matara people: Gayantha
MP Aelian Nanayakkara had rendered a great service for the people of Matara, especially serving the people of Kamburupitiya in areas of education, transport and health, Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunatillake said.
He said this moving the condolence motion of the late MP Aelian Nanayakkara in Parliament yesterday.
Aelian Nanayakkara came to Parliament representing the Kamburupitiya electorate and coloured the Parliament with his presence. He had the thought of making farming a profitable profession and has done much to develop the agriculture sector. Having toured many countries including the UK and Cuba during his time, he brought back many methods used in those countries to uplift the agriculture sector in this country and the lives of the people, Minister Karunatillake said. He served in Parliament for around seven years and rendered an immense service to the people of his electorate, Minister Karunatillake said.
Prof. Warnapalas demise is a great loss: Dinesh
Moving the condolence motion of Prof. Vishva Warnapala in Parliament yesterday, Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena said his demise is a great loss to the country, and he has given the country a great part of himself and his knowledge.
He was a person who gave priority to what was ethical and correct, irrespective of party hue. He was actively involved in the student struggle back in 1956, he said.
Gunawardena, paying tribute to Prof. Warnapalas exceptional knowledge on politics said, A book written by him on politics is a vast treasure trove of information for newcomers to politics.
It gives in-depth knowledge and insight into the politics of this country and is an ideal handbook for newcomers to the political arena to follow.
As a national level MP, he never hesitated to help the needy people in the areas he lived in irrespective of which party or race they belonged to, Dinesh Gunawardena said, adding that Prof. Warnapala was an exceptional politician, above all, he was a compassionate and humble human being, he said.
He noted that the demise of Prof. Warnapala has created a void very hard to fill and will be felt for a long time.
He not only contributed immensely to the politics but also to the education field. Most of all, he was an ideal example of gentlemanly politics.
Tabs will be provided in the future: Akila Viraj
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam assured that the Tabs would be provided to GCE Advance Level students in the future as the government has had to allocate funds for other priority heads.
The Minister asserted that the Tab Provision Project was suspended not because of a flaw in the tender procedure but on a decision of the Cabinet of Ministers on a suggestion by President Mithripala Sirisena. He said the Tender procedure was flawless.
Minister Kariyawasam made these observations in response to a query by Joint Opposition MP Dullas Alahapperuma as to why the government suspended the project, during the round of questions for oral answers.
He said the schoolchildren are worried of the governments decision to stop granting tabs to them, as this was vital in this age of technology.
Minister Kariyawasam said the proper procedure was followed in connection with the Tab procurement. Some companies attempted to mislead us, but we followed the proper path and we could save more than Rs 2 billion.
He added that it was due to the Presidents request that the Cabinet decided not to grant Tabs. But computers and Tabs are important to move forward with the modern technology and development, he said.
Warnapala, Nanayakkara: Professionals of great dedication: Alahapperuma
Joint Opposition MP Dullas Alahapperuma, seconding the condolence motion of the late MP Aelian Nanayakkara said he (Alahapperuma) considered it a privilege rather than a duty.
He said Prof. Vishva Warnapala and Attorney Aelian Nanayakkara were professionals, one a professor and the other a lawyer. They were professionals of great dedication and respect who were not willing to sacrifice their integrity and politics to the highest bidder.
They had pure politics at the core of their hearts and they never used their parliamentary positions for their personal advantage. Both were decent and dedicated and honest politicians who had been christened by leftist ideologies. They are a breed of political species facing extinction, he said.
Wishing them eternal bliss, Alahapperuma said their political carrier is an example that all parliamentarians should follow.
Nanayakkara had a great knowledge of legal matters: Gajadheera
Even judges consulted the late Attorney MP Aelian Nanayakkara on certain matters as he had a great knowledge of legal matters, MP Chandrasiri Gajadheera said.
Expressing his views during the condolence motion moved in Parliament yesterday on the late MP Aelian Nanayakkara, he said he (Nanayakkara) served as a parliamentarian from 1970 -77 and was a proficient lawyer.
He was bold in Parliament when he represented his clients and had the guts to stand up for what was right and did not hesitate to speak up against what was wrong, even in court, Gajadheera said.
He noted that Nanayakkara wanted to develop science facilities in Kamburupitiya to uplift the education of the children of the area.
His vision on education was greatly manifested in all development activities in his area. He worked tirelessly to uplift the farming community and develop short term harvesting methods of paddy cultivation. He was of the view that agriculture should be made into a profitable venture and was dedicated to providing and developing infrastructure facilities for farmers to cultivate various crops.
Gajadheera said MP Aelian Nanayakkara was a pioneer in the cooperative development area and strived to bring the regional cooperatives to a good standard to serve the estate sector people better.
He worked hard to uplift the cooperative sector not for personal gain but solely for the benefit of the people. He said Nanayakkara believed that a political solution was needed to resolve the countrys ethnic problem. It is a great loss that we have lost such a visionary and bold political figure and there are many lessens that we can take from the examples he had set for us to follow,
Parliament presents condolences over death of Prof. Warnapala
The condolence motion of the former UPFA General Secretary, Prof. Vishva Warnapala was taken up in Parliament yesterday.
Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella presented the condolence motion to Parliament.
Highlighting the contribution made by the late Prof. Warnapala with gratitude, the minister said Warnapala was a humble leader who had rendered a great service to develop the universities in the country. Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva in his condolence message said Prof. Warnapala was an intellectual who had taken this countrys image to the highest levels both locally and internationally.
He has done an in-depth study of the Constitution. Having commenced his political journey from the SLFP, he presented the Bandaranaike vision to the country combining the countrys politics with current issues. Despite his exceptional knowledge and achievements, he was a humble politician.
He served as the General Secretary of the UPFA. No doubt, his demise is an immense loss to Sri Lankas political sphere, he said.
Death of Principal Rohini Kumari:
Statement will be made upon receiving investigation report: Education Minister
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said in Parliament yesterday that he would make a statement on the incident that caused the death of the principal of the Suchi National School, Rohini Kumari, after he receives the report of the investigation.
He said a directive was given to initiate an investigation immediately after the incident. He assured that stern steps would be taken if it is proved that it was the fault of the organisation that conducted the leadership programme.
He made these observations yesterday in response to a question raised by joint opposition Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma during the round of oral questions.
MP Alahapperuma brought to the notice of the House that this was the second death of this kind. He added that this leadership training programme is being conducted by a private institution and some of the principles had questioned the standard of the equipment being used. MP Alahapperuma questioned as to what measures would be taken to prevent the repetition of such unfortunate incidents.
Minister Kariyawasam said that he had issued instructions to hold an investigation into the incident. He said he would make a statement upon receiving the report. He added that according to the information that he had received so far, the principal had engaged in an exercise that was not compulsory for them. He added that he learnt that many principles had refused to take part in the exercise while she had taken up the challenge.
He said that before 2015 too, such leadership training programmes were conduced for principals. But they were conducted by the Army, Minister Kiriella said. Those principles were given army ranks as well, he said.
He said that later it was decided to accord the training to a private institution. He added that it was not fair to stop such a programme due to an occasional incident.
During the dialogue, MP Alahapperuma said that the training had been tough for the elderly principles. He added that even during military training, a Colonel or an officer of a higher rank would not be given tough training designed for a newcomer.
Citing an example he said young Minister Kariyawasam would be able to climb down a rope during training, but it would be a problem for Speaker Jayasuriya to attempt the same feat.
Speaker Jayasuriya in response said that he had climbed down ropes during his hay days, which made the other members burst into laughter and MP Alahapperuma readily agreed that he had done so as an army officer.

Rich  heritage of Catholic Church  comes to life
The air was thick with tropical heat in the cathedral in Kotahena Sunday evening as worshippers prepared for the mass. Schoolchildren in choir robes lined up on bleachers. Across from them, violinists in all black tuned their instruments.
It was no ordinary Sunday. St. Lucias, the seat of the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Colombo, was filled to capacity. The domed ceiling was lit up a fantastic blue.
The organizers, in fact, had to set up plastic folding chairs and projectors in front of the churchs Roman columns outside to accommodate the overflow crowd.
This special mass, which the church had been organizing for the past month, was meant to stand out. We want to popularize some of the heritage of our singing in the church, said Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith at a press conference in January.
Rather than a normal mass, Sundays gathering was meant to showcase some of the Catholic Churchs most beautiful music, performed by a huge group of singers and musicians
At 6 p.m., the mass began. The combined choruses  more than 200 people in total  sang in Latin, from Franz Schuberts Mass in G Major.
For the next two hours, both professional and school singers filled the cathedral, the largest and oldest on the island, with music.
In one alcove, conductor Gregory Rose, visiting Sri Lanka from the U.K., directed men and women from Camerato, the Choir of St. Peters College, Choral Spectrum, Coro CantAmici, Contempo, La Scala Negambo, the Past Pupils choir of Good Shepherd Convent, the Soul Sounds Academy Choir, Speranza, St. Marys Choral Society, St. Theresas Choral Society, the Old Joes Choir, the Peradeniya Singers, the Philharmonic Choir, and Vox One. Rose also led the musicians of the Chamber Music Society of Colombo.
In the opposite alcove, Choral Director Francis DAlmeida led the combined choir of Archdiocesan schools and parishes. They were the choirs of: St. Josephs College, St. Benedicts College, Good Shepherd Convent, St. Lawrence Convent, St. John the Baptist Church Kandana, St. John Dal Bastone Church, Pelawatte, St. Josephs Church, Grandpass, and the Archdiocesan Choir.
This Sunday was the third Latin Choral Mass the Archdiocese has organized over the past three years. The church wants to bring the rich heritage of this music to our people, said Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, who presided over the mass.
We wanted to show that Sri Lankans are capable of singing those songs with such elegance, he added.
The mass followed a traditional structure, including a sermon, readings from the Bible, and a communion.
But aside from some readings and announcements in English, the music was completely performed in Latin. The Mass in G Major of the Austrian composer Franz Schubert  who died at the young age of 31 after writing hundreds of pieces  came to life in the Colombo cathedral.
The Latin Mass ceremoniously welcomed the season of Lent, the season where Catholics through prayer and penance remember the death of Jesus Christ.
Cardinal Ranjith said this Lent season is the year of the Good Shepherd, and the communion section of the mass recognized this theme, as the choirs and worshippers alike sang ego sum pastor bonus: I am the Good Shepherd. According to the communion, it is the Good Shepherd who dies for his flock.
Cardinal Ranjith said he hoped the traditional music, performed on a grand scale, would inspire young people to engage with the heritage of the church.
He said the Latin Mass, once the staple of the Catholic Church, was starting to gain popularity around the world. But one thing is for sure. In Colombo, it was a success.

Sanstha, first brand to move to blended cement
INSEE Sanstha, the most popular brand of cement in the country is the first Blended Cement launched in Sri Lanka. INSEE Sanstha is a blended cement,enriched with Calcium Carbonate (CaC03) extracted from local quarries, resulting in fresh, consistent quality that produces significantly stronger and more durable structures than any other cement.
Blended Cement has5 key benefits that make it better than ordinary cement. It has improved strength, longer durability,better workability, provides an aesthetic finish and requires less water to mix. As a blended cement, INSEE Sanstha offers Sri Lankan home builders the advantage of a cement blended with Calcium Carbonate (CaC03)particles which closes all the pores in the concrete, making it stronger.
The blended Sanstha Cement is not only more durable, but most importantly, it prevents water from entering the iron structures, preventing the iron from rusting. In fact, an entire bag of Sanstha Cement only requires 25 litres of water to mix.
The added Calcium Carbonate (CaC03) and other particles work as a lubricant resulting in a concrete mixture that is easier to apply, making plastering more efficient and the end result, more aesthetic.
Jan Kunigk, Executive Vice President / Commercial Director of INSEE Cement explained INSEE Sanstha has been the market leader in Sri Lanka for decades due to its consistent quality.
Globally, cement markets have moved towards blended cement due to its high strength and durability as opposed to Ordinary Portland Cement (SLS 107). In Sri Lanka, Sanstha was the first brand to move to Blended Cement.
This proves INSEE Cement`s efforts to consistently innovate to provide superior products to Sri Lankans. Today cities such as Singapore, Jakarta, Delhi and local structures such as the Lotus Tower are all made out of Blended Cement.
Sri Lanka can achieve what Singapore is today by also using Blended Cement, whether it is for a home, high riser or port! Blended Cements are better, more durable and stronger. INSEE Cement in Sri Lanka also known as Siam City Cement (Lanka) Limited, is a member of the Siam City Cement Public Company Limited, a leading cement manufacturer in Southeast Asia, founded in 1969 in Thailand.

Sri Lanka working for lasting peace -Tittawella
Sri Lanka is engaging in strengthening ethnic harmony while working for achieving a lasting peace, Secretary General of the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms, Mano Tittawella said.
He was addressing an international conference on reparation held in Colombo yesterday under the theme Moving from a divided past to a shared future. The event was organised by the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms (SCRM) with support from the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
In moving ahead with the setting up of a reparation system in Sri Lanka, the conference provides a platform for mutual dialogue and consultation around the key elements of informed, fair, transparent and efficient decision-making by soliciting international expert advice and learning from the experiences of other countries that went through similar processes and challenges.
The conference had around 160 participants from around the globe representing government and non-government sectors, development partners, the United Nations, NGOs, civil society organisations, academics and other stakeholders.
Tittawella added that there is a good opportunity for the country to achieve lasting peace and to strengthen harmony. The country suffered a lot for decades as a result of terrorism. But now there is a better opportunity for the country to move towards lasting peace. Therefore the government has taken many measures to take the reconciliation process forward.
The government has allocated Rs 12.5 billion in the recent budget to take the reconciliation process forward, he noted.
Moves are being taken to increase the infrastructure facilities of the people affected by terrorism. He added that issues of the resettled peoples are being solved.
Addressing the gathering, IOM Sri Lanka Chief of Mission Giuseppe Crocetti appreciated the cordial cooperation of the Sri Lankan government concerning the field of reparation. He added that the IOM is working on minimising the issues of migrants, while the UN is drawing its utmost attention on displaced people. Besides, several measures such as capacity building and working to avoid conflicts are being taken by the IOM.
Australian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, Bryce Hutchesson said the Australian government is working hand in hand with Sri Lanka to take the reconciliation process forward. The Australian government has allocated US$ 560 million during the last few years for strengthening the reconciliation process in Sri Lanka.
Time has arisen for Sri Lanka to move from a divided past to a shared future, Hutchesson said.

Status quo prevailed after a bout of turbulence
The rumour mill had gone into overdrive late Sunday night with all sorts of speculation on prorogation of Parliament, break-up of National Unity Government, a possible power shift and crossover of some defecting MPs.
It was amidst these speculations and a week-long political impasse due to unforeseen developments after the Local Government polls that Parliament sat on Monday to carry on its legislative business.
It preceded a crucial meeting among President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya late Sunday night with the aim to resolve the political stand-off between the two main parties in the ruling coalition. It was reported this eleventh hour meeting of the first, second and third citizens of the country had led to an agreement culminating the days of uncertainty and instability in the Government.
However, the closed-door meetings of the political parties had not seen an end even as Parliament met on Monday, and the media had given prominence to a comment by Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala that the UPFA decided to quit the Unity Government. It was against this backdrop, a special debate was requested by Joint Opposition on the current political situation in the country.
Debate on political crisis
The Speaker with the consent of Party Leaders paved the way for a three-hour adjournment debate for the purpose of recognizing the national importance and urgency of the matter. The UNP, JO, TNA and JVP actively took part in it, giving their own interpretations to the results of recently concluded LG polls and the future of National Government. The benches of SLFP members in the Government ranks were mostly empty because the President was having a group meeting with them at the Presidential Secretariat as the debate continued.
However, Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala hurried to Parliament following the meeting at the request of the Speaker to explain the SLFP position and his remarks to the media the other day. He said his partys decision to quit the Government was revisited and that they wait for the Supreme Court opinion to arrive at a final decision.
The JO, which was waiting in the wings to cash in on internal power struggle of the Government, however could not make much out of the debate as the two parties had agreed to continue with the status quo by then. The JO, revelling in the pleasure of its victory at the LG elections, went on to apply those results to that of a General Election. The JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena, moving the adjournment motion, called on the Government to step down stating that it no longer has the peoples mandate to continue in the office.
Only two blocs at a Referendum
JO stalwart Wimal Weerawansa seconded the motion stating that the voters in large numbers had heeded to their calls to consider the LG elections a referendum to express their disapproval to the Government. JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake counter argued that interpreting the LG polls as a referendum was in fact favourable to the Government as there could be only two blocs at a referendum.
One can easily say the two blocs here were those supportive of Rajapaksa clan and those against them. This is exactly how the Government also wants to portray the results. In that sense, the anti-Rajapaksa group emerged stronger than the SLPP. But the LG polls were not a show down between two parties. It was a multi-party contest, he added.
MP Dissanayake, stressing that the ruling coalition has failed to keep to their promises for which they received peoples mandate on January 8, 2015, pointed out this disillusionment was the main cause for the Governments set back in the LG polls.
UNP Ministers Navin Dissanayake and Dr Rajitha Senaratne, humbly accepting the polls outcome as an eye opener, stressed the need for a course correction. Making a reflective speech, Minister Dissanayake said that the UNP would concentrate on its weaknesses, correct its mistakes and work resolutely with much vigour to fulfill the peoples aspirations. With his gentlemanliness, Dissanayake at the outset of his speech congratulated the SLPP for its success at the LG polls despite it being a fledgling party. At the same time, he warned the JO not to be carried away by the notion that they command the majority support in the country. Bear in your mind that when you obtained 44.65 percent of the votes cast, the other parties have obtained 55.35 percent, he told the JO.
Eelam will bloom from your lotus bud
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa were attending the debate but both the leaders did not take the floor. Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, joining in the debate, took former President Rajapaksa, who was in the seat next to him, head on for the latters remarks in the campaign trail that incited fears of a Tamil Eelam among the Sinhala electorate.
The Opposition Leader said he was alarmed at the former Presidents remark in the run up to the elections that the Tamil Eelam could bloom after the LG elections. Sampanthan also expressed his dismay that the SLPP virulently carried out its false propaganda in all the temples in the Sinhala villages in the South.
That is unfortunate. My party in this election talked of a political solution within the framework of an undivided indivisible single country. There was no campaign carried out anywhere in the North and the East which talked of division. When we did that how dare former President Rajapaksa say that Eelam could bloom after the elections Wasnt he deceiving the people of the South including himself he questioned with strong emotion.
I want everybody in this country to know that if this malicious, vicious and fallacious propaganda on the part of President Rajapaksa and SLPP persists, Eelam will bloom not on account of us but on account of your lotus bud, he added referring to the party symbol of the SLPP.
Please resist your temptation to achieve cheap political gains by carrying on such false propaganda, he urged the former President.
Future of National Government
In the meantime, the sense of indecisiveness on the continuation of National Government and questions on its validity after the initial two-year period of agreement between the UNP and the SLFP were duly addressed in Parliament on Wednesday.
Ending days of uncertainty and speculation, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera officially announced in Parliament that the National Government formed by the UNP and the UPFA is intact and both parties desire to continue it.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, making a ministerial statement on the request of the Speaker, told the House that the Resolution passed on September 3, 2015 to give effect to the National Government is still valid.
We have not rescinded the Resolution. It is still operative. There are no circumstances yet to cancel it, the PM gave a succinct answer.
The UPFA General Secretary also confirmed Parliament that his party has not withdrawn from the National Government and still working within the initial agreement signed between the two parties. SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake was also present as Amaraweera made the statement.
As Amaraweera stated his partys position, the members in the Government benches thumped their desks to express their pleasure.
Putting to rest any further doubts, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya finally added that he accepts the official positions communicated to the House by the Prime Minister and the UPFA General Secretary on the continuation of National Government.
The members of both sides were also seen talking to each other with interest in the Lobby on the impending Cabinet reshuffle. The Government, before it faces crucial national level elections in two years time, has an onerous task of delivering its key promises to the people while walking the talk on its good governance policy. The abilities of Ministers assuming responsibilities in key ministerial portfolios including Law and Order and Justice will be important to achieve the desired goals.

Tea bag  diaries
Apparently, there are many different ways to keep a diary and this unique artist from New York, Ruby Silvious, has discovered an amazing one. While some of us tend to throw away used tea bags after finishing our tea, Silvious reuses them - as canvases for her miniature paintings.
The used tea bag is not very attractive. But while you may see a soggy, stained tea bag, I see a blank canvas, the artist wrote earlier on Bored Panda.
The visual diary records my impression of the moment using the used tea bag as a medium, altered to create a new work of art every day. I draw, paint and collage moody, evocative and sometimes whimsical art on the used teabag paper.
Ruby Silvious began painting on tea bags in 2015 to push her creative practice and to share it on social media, hoping to spark a different kind of inspiration.
People have this notion of what traditional art should be. I think reimagining the discarded as art inspires new forms of creativity, claims Silvious.
I hope that people who view my art are changed in some way, perhaps with a renewed belief in the art of the possible.

Team to Dubai to negotiate Udayangas extradition due to arrive today
The team that left the country on Tuesday to negotiate with the Dubai authorities regarding the extradition of the former Sri Lanka Ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga is expected to return to the country today (23).
However, an FCID source told the Daily News yesterday that it was still uncertain whether Weeratunga would be brought back to the country by this team today.
When contacted, the Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maheshini Colonne said no one from the Foreign Ministry had been on this team that left for Dubai last Tuesday and she had not received any information regarding Weeratunges arrest so far.
The team comprising members of the Attorney Generals Department and the FCID had left for Dubai to make submissions to the courts there in order to have the former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga, extradited to Sri Lanka. Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda and FCID Director P.K.D. Priyantha had left the country armed with a red warrant for Weeratungas arrest.
Weeratunga was detained in Dubai on February 4, but his extradition was not possible due to diplomatic issues and the absence of an extradition agreement between the two countries.

The other bowlers who has made an impression is right-arm off-spinner Janushka Fernando (23).
The key bowler for Isipathana is Madushka Sandaruwan who has taken 44 wickets with best figures of 5 for 20 against DS Senanayake. He has received valuable support from Sanjula Ilangathilaka with 29 wickets and skipper Ayana Siriwardana and Lahiru Weeraratne who have claimed 22 wickets each.
Both teams have yet to establish a worthy record of wins and of the 54 matches played, Thurstan have won five and Isipathana has bagged the trophy four times with the rest ending in draws. The last win in the series was recorded by Isipathana College in 1999 under the captaincy of Krishantha Jayawardene. Thurstan College last won in 1992 under Mackenzie Perera.

Touch of Klaasen as SA beat India
CENTURION, Wednesday: For the second time in his short career, Heinrich Klaasen halted India's cricketing juggernaut as South Africa won the second Twenty20 international by six wickets at SuperSport Park on Wednesday.
Klaasen slammed seven sixes in hitting 69 off 30 balls as South Africa chased down a target of 189 with eight balls to spare.
The win squared the three-match series, taking it to a decider in Cape Town on Saturday.
Both teams had to contend with a wet ball, with drizzle falling during both innings.
Klaasen, who was man of the match when South Africa gained their only win in the one-day series, opened his score with two sixes and didn't look back. JP Duminy played an anchor role before finishing the match with two sixes in an innings of 64 not out off 40 balls.
Virat Kohli praised Manish Pandey and MS Dhoni, who hit 79 not out and 52 not out respectively in an unbeaten fifth wicket stand of 98 off 56 balls to get India to 188 for four after they had been struggling at 45 for three.  AFP

## Title: A trailblazer in publishing and journalism
## Supertitle: D. R. Wijewardene:

D. R. Wijewardene:
A trailblazer in publishing and journalism
Only a few people have influenced the course of Sri Lanka's history in the manner that D.R. Wijewardene, founder of the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (ANCL), has done. As we commemorate the 132nd birth anniversary of this noble son of Lanka, it is time to re-appraise his yeoman service to the nation.
Don Richard Wijewardene was born on February 23, 1886 as the third child of Muhandiram Tudugala Don Philip Wijewardene of Sedawatte, Wellampitiya in the suburbs of Colombo and Helena Wijewardene of Waragoda, Kelaniya. Helena Wijewardene known as Lamatheni (Lady) was the greatest philanthropist at that time also got the Kelaniya temple restored to its present grandeour and glory at her own expense.
D. R. Wijewardene received his primary education at Sedawatte School and his secondary education at S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia. At that College he got through his Junior Cambridge and Senior Cambridge creditably well and proceeded to England to join the Cambridge University. He obtained B A and LLB Law and returned to the Motherland in 1912, having also qualified as a Barrister-at-Law of the Inner Temple.
It was during his studies in England that the seeds of his future endeavours were sown. He closely associated with a number of Indians and Sri Lankans who were involved in the independence campaigns in the two countries. He too wanted to raise the voice of the common man for independence. The medium he selected for this noble task was the newspaper.
Wijewardene, hailing from an affluent family, could have looked the other way and pursued his legal career in the UK or Sri Lanka and business interests while the people suffered under the yoke of colonialism. But he did not. He was in the vanguard of the freedom movement and in newspapers, found the perfect medium to carry forward the freedom struggle.
He once said: I did not start a newspaper enterprise to bring home great argosies. There are many other fields in which fortunes can be made faster than in the newspaper industry. This speaks volumes about his vision and mission.
It is perhaps ironic that the very idea of starting a newspaper company was proposed to Wijewardene by an Englishman - F. A. M. Cobert, a respected lawyer. That did not prevent Wijewardene from campaigning for the ouster of the colonial Government from our shores via his newspapers.
Wijewardene took the epoch-making step towards building his newspaper group, still the country's largest, by acquiring the 'Dinamina' pioneered by H. S. Perera, in 1914. His next major step was the acquisition of The Ceylonese' in 1918, which he renamed Ceylon Daily News'. In fact, the Ceylon Daily News became such an ingrained part of people's lives that many old timers still call it the CDN, long after the newspaper shed the 'Ceylon' tag.
Daily News 100 years
It is indeed fitting that the Daily News, the flagship of ANCL nurtured by Wijewardene, celebrated its 100th anniversary just last month. The Daily News was  and is  a microcosm of Wijewardenes vision for a newspaper. Wijewardene would have been among the happiest of individuals if he were alive today to see the progress made by the Daily News and other publications of ANCL.
It became one of the most influential voices in the local political scene, shaping opinions and creating debate and it remains so, 100 years on.
The Daily News is still recognized as the leading English daily in Sri Lanka with a global print and online readership. Todays all-colour high-tech Daily News is a far cry from the very first Daily News of January 3, 2018, but the values that the newspaper was founded on, such as its commitment to the highest standards of journalism, still remain the same.
Another milestone in his odyssey was the outright purchase of the then 90-year-old Observer in 1923. He eventually owned seven newspapers - Dinamina, Silumina, Ceylon Daily News, Observer, Sunday Observer, Thinakaran and Sunday Thinakaran. In fact, the ANCL was the only publishing house that printed newspapers and periodicals in all three languages until a few years ago.
Having a fine grasp of the intricacies of journalism, he sought the best journalists and editors for his newspapers and indeed, they are still household names. These individuals shared Wijewardene's passion for journalism and high editorial standards. He also ensured that his newspapers reflected the views and concerns of all communities and religious groups.
A patriot to the core, he wanted the nation to triumph over adversity and forge unity in diversity. Through the Daily News and Dinamina, he saw an opportunity to fight for values that we hold dear - freedom, democracy and sovereignty. There was another driving force that helped him in this effort  Buddhism.
His Buddhist background and faith in the Buddhist doctrine helped him to get through all the storms and emerge stronger. It is no coincidence that until recently, Lake House was the only publishing house to offer a weekly Buddhist periodical (Budusarana).
As one of his biographers, a former chief editor of the Daily News H.A.J. Hulugalle wrote, "before he was fifty, D. R. Wijewardene had established several flourishing newspapers, built up a great business and influenced the course of the Island's history. Perseverance, courage and a high sense of public duty were the main elements of his success."
An iconic building
He was a perfectionist and a trailblazer. The Lake House (so named because of its proximity to the Beira Lake) edifice, instantly recognized by people across the island, is a proud monument to his lasting legacy.
This iconic building itself will turn 100 a decade from now. He had the foresight to see that technology will improve and hence commissioned a building that is fairly flexible to accommodate larger printing presses. He installed the latest printing technology available at that time and assured a good working environment for his employees. Lake House employees enjoy some of the welfare measures he initiated to this day.
Indeed, men of his calibre are few and far between. While the newspaper industry has changed drastically since 1920s, the ideals he cherished in the field of journalism still hold true. However, not all journalists and media outlets play by these rules.
Today, print media outlets are facing stiff competition from electronic media  there was no television here during Wijewardene's time. Newspapers have also embraced the Internet even as they compete with dedicated news websites and so-called citizen journalism websites. People are bombarded with news 24/7, on their mobiles, on television, radio and on the Net. Truth and accuracy often become casualties of this 'race to be first' and even national interests are sometimes disregarded.
Despite these developments, reports of the death of the newspaper are greatly exaggerated. Newspapers still have a story to tell  one that is more analytical, more in-depth and more trustworthy than the sound bites and video clips of the Internet age. That tallies with what D.R. Wijewardene wanted to do with his newspaper  telling stories with depth, perception and purpose.
All journalists still have to be guided by the principles that D.R. Wijewardene believed in  being bold, truthful and objective - in this noble mission.
There are only a very few left alive who have worked with him and who can recall his zest for life itself, but long after they are gone, a grateful nation will remember his steadfast commitment to journalism, truth and above all, courage.

wbehind perfect alignment  of Egypt's Pyramids
Ancient Egyptians may have used the autumn equinox to align the Great Pyramid of Giza almost perfectly along the four cardinal points, a study has found.
The autumn equinox occurs halfway between the summer and winter solstices, when Earths tilt is such that the length of the day and night are almost the same.
The Great Pyramid of Giza was constructed about 4,500 years ago, under the orders of Egyptian pharaoh Khufu.
It is the largest of the three pyramids - standing about 138 metres - on the Giza Plateau and was considered a wonder of the world by ancient writers.
The builders of the Great Pyramid of Khufu aligned the great monument to the cardinal points with an accuracy of better than four minutes of arc, or one-fifteenth of one degree, according to Glen Dash, an engineer who studies the Giza pyramids.
The pyramid of Khafre (also located at Giza) and the Red Pyramid (located at the site of Dahshur) are also aligned with a high degree of accuracy, Dash noted.
All three pyramids exhibit the same manner of error; they are rotated slightly counterclockwise from the cardinal points, Dash wrote in a study published in the Journal of Ancient Egyptian Architecture.
For over a century, researchers have proposed different methods used by the ancient Egyptians to align the pyramids along these cardinal points with such accuracy.Dash discovered a method that makes use of the fall equinox could have been used, the Live Science reported.In an experiment conducted on September 22, 2016 (the day of the autumn equinox), Dash placed a rod on a wooden platform and marked the location of the rods shadow throughout the day.
On the equinox, the surveyor will find that the tip of the shadow runs in a straight line and nearly perfectly east-west, Dash wrote.
The degree of error is slightly counterclockwise, similar to the error found in the Great Pyramid, Khafre Pyramid and Red Pyramid, Dash found. The tilt of Earth on the fall equinox allows the shadow to run in this east-west direction.

The Supreme Court yesterday refixed for support for October 15, a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed by former Transport Minister Kumara Welgama.
The Court was informed through a State Counsel that the FCID has not concluded its investigations into the magisterial inquiry.
Kalutara District UPFA Parliamentarian KumaraWelgama had sought an order preventing the FCID from arresting and remanding him in connection with alleged financial fraud said to have taken place at the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB), while several tenders were awarded to two private companies to supply bus spare parts between 2011 to 2015.
Through this petition, Welgama sought the intervention of the Supreme Court to exercise the fundamental rights jurisdiction to prevent his imminent arrest over the magisterial inquiry at Colombo Magistrates Court No 3.
In his petition, the former Minister had cited FCID Chief Inspector (Unit 7) C.I. Ranasinghe, ASP P.K. Serasinghe, DIG Ravi Waidyalankara, police chief N.K. Ilangakoon and the Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioner further sought an order and declaration that collective acts of the first to fourth respondents cause an imminent infringement of his fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1), 12(2), 13(1) of the Constitution.

The J.C. Weliamuna report should be considered if a Presidential Commission investigates into the alleged massive corruptions committed at SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Air during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, said Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim in Parliament yesterday.
He also said that the Public Enterprise Development Ministry has taken all measures to take legal action on the Mihin Lanka corruption. He also added that if the COPE Committee would initiate further investigations into the incident, his ministry would extend its fullest support.
Minister Kabir Hashim made these observations when Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna Parliamentarian Dr. Nalinda Jayathissa charged that the government was not taking adequate steps on the corruption report of SriLankan Airlines.
He made the charge during the round of questions for oral answers. He questioned as to why the Government does not take steps based on the JC Weliamuna report which this government had spent much to investigate and prepare.
Minister Kabir Hashim further stated that the government has handed over the reports of the SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Air corruptions to the FCID and the Police to take further legal action. He added that it was a collective responsibility of all the members of Parliament take responsibility with regard to taking further legal action.

WICKREMASINGHE  was a menacing paceman
He mastered his art as a pace bowler at Rahula College, Matara before coming down to Colombo and growing in stature and finally sporting the countrys much treasured cap GALAGE PRAMODYA WICKREMASINGHE.
Tall and strongly built with a structure ideal for fast bowling, WICKREMASINGHE has a record that will be envied by many bowlers and that being capturing 10 wickets for 41 in a limited over match against Kalutara YCC which is a rare feat at whatever level.
He was a bowler who had an easy run up to the wicket and that gives him the speed as he neared the wicket to unleash his variety of deliveries with a lovely action that batsmen found difficult to read the movement of the ball and get in line to execute.
In the history of Sri Lanka cricket, fast bowlers have been rolling out of the production machines in their numbers. Names that come to mind are many.
Leading the sped merchants was Kalay Jayasundera who was a terror in the 1940s. Before the country was admitted a full member of the International Cricket Conference we had speedsters who were like bullet trains whose names are mentioned below.
In the 1950s, 60s and 70s when the whistle stop games, the unofficial Tests or Gopalan Trophy games were the serious cricket the country played, and most importantly when no protection was provided to batsmen, like helmets, chest, thigh guards and elbow guards, batsmen wore only the box.
Fiery speed
Yet they stood up to the fiery speed of speedsters like Stanley de Alwis, Tita Nathanilelsz, T.B.Kehelgamuwa, L.R. Gunetilleke, Sonny Yatawara, Sylvester Dias, Nihal Zoysa, Cecil Waidyaratne, Norton Fredrick, Dennis Ferdinands, Anton Perera, J.K.C. Gunesekera, Nihal Samarasekera, Glen Vanlangenberg and Jackie Robertson to name few that come to mind were fearsome to face. Todays fast bowlers are nowhere near the speed of those mentioned above.
Yet batsmen of that era were gutty, fearless and faced and scored runs off them with grace and style blunting their express speed and frustrating them. These bowlers had bouncers that were threatening if struck. But batsmen played the hook shot to perfection that sailed for six and the fast bowlers refrained from bouncing.
After gaining Test status there were menacing fast bowlers like Asantha de Mel, Rumesh Ratnayake, Ravi Ratnayake, Vinodhan John, Graeme Labrooy and Lasith Malinga. This week in the SPORTS LEGENDS column the writer features another fine paceman who joined the exalted company of the above mentioned.
Top class players
WICKREMASINGHE decided right when he joined the Sinhalese Sports Club where there were top class players which included Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga who corrected the little faults he had and it was not long before he was included to the national pool after the Youth Asia Cup tournament in Bangladesh in 1989. In 1991 he toured England with the Sri Lanka B team.
WICKREMASINGHE was in the Sri Lanka World Cup winning team in 1996, but sadly did not get a game with other more penetrative bowlers in the team. He played in 40 Test matches capturing 85 wickets with his best figures being 6 for 80.
But it was in the one-day game that he showed his true potential capturing 109 wickets with his best being 4 for 48. In 123 first class matches he pocketed 345 wickets. I was on many tours with WICKREMASINGHE and watched him bowl exceedingly well beating many batsmen with his late swing, but not having the fortune to capture more wickets.
Career cut short
He had his career cut short by a shoulder injury but was in the swim of things in Sri Lanka Cricket as a selector. He was one of the most like able and disciplined cricketer who was a good conversationalist but was shy to talk about his exploits.
WICKREMASINGHE played his First Test against Pakistan at Sialkot from December 12 to 17 1991. His final Test was against South Africa at Centurion from January 20 to 25, 2001. His ODI debut was against Bangladesh in Kolkota on December 31, 1990 and the last ODI against England at Manchester in July 7, 2002.
WICKREMASINGHE who started his club career at SSC also played for Burgher Recreation Club and also Tamil Union. WICKREMASINGHE also served the game as a selector.

Work of Greater Dambulla Drinking Water Scheme expedited
A discussion was held to expedite work of the Greater Dambulla Drinking Water Scheme at the City Planning and Water Supply Ministry under the chairmanship of the Secretary to the Ministry Hapuaratchi under the advice of Minister Rauf Hakeem, in accordance with the requests of the people of the Greater Dambulla area. A committee comprising higher officials of the Water Supply and the Drainage Board and the Watek Compny, which is handling the construction activities of the project will be appointed in this regard.
The project has a vast storage tank of 65,000 cubic meters per day, two automatic water purification plants of 32,000 cubic meters each, seven service reservoirs, two water towers, two pumping stations, and a network of 72 kilo meter transmission lines to distribute water to an area of 220 kilo meters.
The first stage of the scheme was started under the assistance of the Exim Bank of India and the Peoples Bank amounting to Rs. 10,000 Million.
The project is now in its last phase and its first stage consisting of a vast storage tank, automatic water purification plant transmission lines was completed and vested with the people by the City Planning and Water Supply Minister on April 9, 2011=7.
The distribution network covering Dambulla, Seegiriya, and Inamaluwa were completed on August 30, 2017. By now, the Operation and Maintenance Unit of the Water Supply and the Drainage Board has provided about 500 connections.
The Board has been able to improve the services of water supply to the Dambulla city and the surrounding areas by providing water purified by the new water purification plant and thereby water shortage for about 5,000 connections that came under the old water supply scheme.
It will become possible to provide pure drinking water through the new service reservoirs to the people very soon in Talakiriyagama, Habrana, and Tittawellagolla. The construction work of the service reservoirs under the project in Kandalama, Kitulhitiywa, and Galewala areas were completed. It is envisaged to complete the transmission and distribution pipe work of Kandalama and Galewala by end of February, 2018 and complete the transmission and distribution pipe work of Kitulhitiyawa by end of March, 2018.
