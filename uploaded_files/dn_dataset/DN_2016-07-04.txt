Sri Lanka A gain major honours
After rain sheeted down the full last two days without allowing a ball to be bowled, Sri Lanka A teams opening match of their tour with Durham ended in a tepid draw. Sri Lanka A played tremendous cricket with both bat and ball to win more honors in this first warm-up.
Roshen Silvas patient innings of 109 and Sachith Pathiranas rapid 51 from just 66 deliveries put Sri Lanka A team towards a dominant game with a first innings score of 352 before their bowlers led by Vishwa Fernando with five wickets conceding just 37 runs in 11.1 overs reduced Durham to an unimpressive 205 all out Gordon Muchall making the top score of 70.
Sri Lanka batting second with a healthy first innings lead of 148 extended their lead to 291 with 8 second wickets in hand and it was the end of the proceedings as no play was possible thereafter due to rain in the last two days of the match. In Lankans second innings too Roshen Silva followed up his century in the first innings with an unbeaten 43 carrying Lankans second innings total to 143 for two in a well-accomplished partnership of 84 for the unfinished third wickets with Mahela Udawatta who made 45 not out.
Sri Lanka A : 353 in 114.2 overs (ARS Silva 109, SS Pathirana 51, PLS Gamage 43*, MS Warnapura 34, NGRP Jayasuriya 31, GS Sandhu 4/70, P Coughlin 3/65) and 143/2 in 52 overs (ML Udawatta 45*, ARS Silva 43*)

Under-15 Division-1 tournament completes first round
Singer under 15 inter-school cricket tournament, first round of which has now been completed, was played according to a unique one-day format with four innings being played in 95 overs. Accordingly, the team batting first have the luxury of batting 65 overs the maximum if they are not bowled out and the opposition will get only 30 overs in the reply innings. This is a very tricky format because if the team batting first bat full 65 overs, the team batting second will not get sufficient overs to go for a first-innings win and therefore, their only option will be to force a draw seeking no-result points.
This situation resulted in most matches ending with no positive results in the end and the situation got more aggravate as rain too curtailed the playing hours of most matches played in the early part of the first round. However, though this new format lowered the competitiveness, it helped especially the batsmen bat with more composure and temperament to gain experience in building patient and longer innings that suits the longer format of the game of cricket. Some teams who batted second chased down big targets successfully and it was a good experience for them to learn how to be more aggressive as well attacking the bowlers in pressure situations in order to achieve big targets whilst keeping their wickets intact at the same time. Scoring of 28 centuries and completion of 115 five-wicket hauls in the first round could be considered as an encouraging plus point under this format.
After the completion of the first round, 40 teams out of the initial participation of 81were qualified to go through to the second round which too would be conducted on league basis under the same format. No team could record more than four wins of any kind and all 81 teams had at least one match ending in no-result. Royal-Colombo who topped Group D becoming the only team to record two outright wins also averaged more than 10 points in six matches they played, a feat no other team could accomplish.
Mahanama College (A) Colombo, St. Sebastian's College (A) Moratuwa, Kalutara Vidyalaya, Royal College (A) Colombo, Isipathana College (A) Colombo, Maliyadeva College (A) Kurunegala, Trinity College (A) Kandy, Rahula College Matara and Mahinda College Galle topped their respective groups on total points whilst Bandaranayake MMV Gampaha and Thurstan College (A) Colombo occupied the top spots of Group E and F on averaged points as teams in these two groups played different number of matches within their group.
The 29 teams qualified to second round next to group leaders in each group are as follows:

Army SC A crowned Limited-Over Tournament champions
When two Army SCs Womens teams, Army (A) and (B) qualified to play in the finals of 2016 Women's D1 Limited-Over Tournament that was played on 29th June at MCA ground, Army (A) proving the strength of their first-tier contingent recorded a huge 189-run win over Army (B) to win the Championship with ease as expected by many. However, this final could not match the excitement normally generated in a final as it was just a testing tussle between two teams of a same club.
Navy SC (A) and Air Force SC (A) finished the first-round of this Womens Limited-over tournament as top two teams in Group A and B respectively when they remained unbeaten winning all three matches they played in the preliminary round. These two teams dominance throughout competition helped them easily clinch two semifinal berths whilst Army SCs (A) and (B) teams secured other two spots in the semifinal lineup.
Despite the fact that the two table leaders won semifinal berths with little challenge from other competitors of the tournament, the other two semi-finalists Army (A) and (B) had to wait until they beat their oppositions in their last two encounters that were played on 25th June.
In two semifinals played on 27th June, Army SC (A) beat Air Force SC (A) ending Air Womens unbeaten run whilst Navy (A) recorded a huge 174-run victory over Army SC (B), but according to a decision taken by the Tournament Committee, Navy SC were disqualified and Army SC (B) were given the opportunity to play in the final.
Navy SC, the only unbeaten team in the tournament, though they failed to play in the final produced tournaments most successful batter and the bowler both when Lasanthi Madhushani topped the tournaments batting list with 230 runs at a healthy average of 76.67 scoring one of the three centuries recorded in the entire tourney whilst Inoka Ranaweera became the leading wicket-taker with 16 wickets to her credit including two five-wicket hauls.
Hasini Perera of Navy, Chamari Atapattu of Air Force and Rebecca Vandort of Army scoring over 150 runs also did well with the bat whilst Niluka Karunarathne of Army, Darshani Darmasiri of Air Force and Madushika Mettananda of Army became other top performers with the ball.
Meanwhile, Chamari Atapattu finished a good all-round show bagging 6 wickets in addition to her 168 with the bat which included a century. The third century maker of the tourney was Nipuni Hansika of Army who claimed the fifth slot in the batting list with 144 runs.

The Bogambara Stadium came alive on Saturday as a top class game of rugby was dished out between arch rivals St. Sylvesters and Vidyartha which was played for the B Nillagoda and P.M.L. Banda memorial trophy.

The winners played with determination and indulged in a superb team effort but had to fight hard for the win. It was a nail-biting game where both teams went all-out.
Though the first half was a close affair it was the winning teams superior speed and better handling of the ball in the second half that brought them victory.
Vidyarthas third row played a good game being in the midst of every move. It was their dynamic forwards who made the breaks in a super game of run and pass rugby.
For Vidyartha M.A.S. Kumara (2), R.G. Alexander, S.N. Kaluarachchi and D.S. Weerasinghe one each scored the tries with C.B. Perera doing the conversions. For St. Sylvester's J.K. Dassanayake scored the tries and V.V. Jayatilake put over the conversions and the penalty.

Djokovic crashes at Wimbledon ending Slam dream
LONDON, SATURDAY: Two-time defending champion Novak Djokovic was sent crashing out of Wimbledon by big-serving Sam Querrey on Saturday, shattering his dreams of securing the first calendar Grand Slam in 47 years.
The world number one, bidding for a fourth Wimbledon title and 13th major, suffered his earliest loss at a Slam since the 2009 French Open.
The 7-6 (8/6), 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 (7/5) third round defeat also ended Djokovic's Open era record run of 30 successive wins at the majors and his streak of having reached 28 consecutive Grand Slam quarter-finals.
Sam played a great match. His game was brutal and I was overpowered, said the Serb, who added that he wasn't 100 percent healthy.
Djokovic, who completed a career Grand Slam at the French Open, refused to dwell on failing to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win a calendar Grand Slam having won in Melbourne and Paris already this year.
I managed to win four Grand Slams in a row. I want to try to focus on that rather than on failure, he added. Coming into Wimbledon, I knew that mentally it's not going to be easy to kind of remotivate myself.
Djokovic added that he would not be playing in the Davis Cup quarter-final against Andy Murray's Great Britain in Belgrade in two weeks time. America's Querrey, the world number 41, built only his second win in 10 meetings with Djokovic on an epic-serving performance over two days after the tie had been suspended with him two sets to the good on Friday.
The 28-year-old sent down 31 aces -- 15 in the fourth set alone -- and saved 14 of 17 break points while unleashing 56 winners.
His reward is a last-16 clash with 34-year-old Frenchman Nicolas Mahut.
It's incredible, especially to do it here at Wimbledon. I'm so ecstatic right now and so happy, said Querrey.
Serena grabs 300th Slam win
Serena Williams needed just 51 minutes to clinch the 300th Grand Slam win of her career on Sunday as the defending champion made the Wimbledon last 16. The 34-year-old American brushed aside Germanys world number 43 Annika Beck 6-3, 6-0 on the back of 25 winners and seven aces and goes on to face long-time Russian rival Svetlana Kuznetsova.
I thought it was good. I still want to get out to a little bit of a faster start but I was really focused and calm, said Williams, who is just six wins short of Martina Navratilovas Open era record of 306 Slam wins. Williams has now won 82 matches at Wimbledon as she remains on course to equal Steffi Grafs Open era record of 22 Grand Slam titles with her seventh Wimbledon crown. AFP

Mathews wont run away from Sri Lanka captaincy
CARDIFF, Saturday  Angelo Mathews said he had no intention of quitting as Sri Lanka captain after yet another crushing defeat by England.
Sri Lanka lost the fifth and final one-day international by 122 runs in Cardiff on Saturday as England took the series 3-0, with one tie and one no result, following their 2-0 success in the preceding three-Test campaign.
Sri Lanka, whose two wins this tour have come in a pair of one-day internationals in Ireland, will have one last chance for a victory on English or Welsh soil on their current trip when they face England in a lone Twenty20 at Southampton on Tuesday.
There will be good times as well as bad, said Mathews, who became Test and one-day skipper in 2013 before taking on the T20 leadership just before this years World Twenty20 in India. This is a tough time for me as a captain and for the whole unit but you cant run away from it, added the 29-year-old all-rounder.
Im pretty sure if we keep improving day-by-day we can come out of this hole, he insisted.
For the past two months weve been having the same problems, either batting bowling or fielding has let us down in every single game.
Especially in the one-dayers we needed a perfect day to win against England.
We didnt have that perfect game and we paid the price.
Congratulations to the English boys, they put us under a lot of pressure and didnt give us the slightest of chances.
They outplayed us in all three departments.
Last year, Sri Lanka thrashed England by nine wickets at the World Cup in Wellington but since then batting greats Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene have both retired.
Mathews, asked if he had been surprised by Englands progress, replied: A few years back they were in the same situation as us, a rebuilding phase and they have stuck to their plans, theyve stuck to their players and now you can see the results.
Theyve been playing some fantastic cricket and are very competitive outside England as well.

Royal stuns Thomians to earn final spot
Invincible Royal College Colombo dished out a superb brand of rugby to shock everyone who were present at the Royal Sports Complex, Reid Avenue where they came from behind 0-7 down to beat the Singer inter-school league rugby runners up S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia by 24 points (3 tries, 3 conversions, 1 penalty) to 15 (2 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty) in their Milo inter-school A Division President trophy knock out rugby semi-final played yesterday. The scores were deadlocked 10-all at half time.
This victory by Royal was one of the best executions by an underdog team which is a tribute to their master tactician head coach Sanath Martis and his assistant Dushanth Lewke for laying out a superb plan which in the end, saw them outwit the far more superior Thomians.
The match got off to a fabulous start where S. Thomas drew first blood in the fifth minute when off a three quarter move their second row forward Wayne Mack forming the overlap crashed through for a try near the left corner flag. Centre Ashwantha Herath made a difficult touchline conversion for S Thomas to go into a 7- nil lead.
Within a couple of minutes Royal fly half Ovin Askey opened scoring through a 30-meter penalty to cut down the lead to 7-3.
In the 26th minute off a rolling maul Royal vice-captain and scrum half Ashoke Wijeykumar broke from the base of the scrum and dummied his way through several Thomian defenders to touch down for a brilliant try mid right. Askey made the conversion and Royal went into a 10-7 lead.
Afterwards S. Thomas centre Herath slotted a 30-meter penalty in the 34th minute of play to equal the scores 10-all at lemons.
Soon after resumption in the 50th minute Royal went into the lead again when off a rolling maul their try scoring architect hooker Azmir Fajudeen scored far left. Askey made the simple conversion and the score read 17-10 in favour of Royal. In the 57th minute Royal scored once more, when captain cum prop forward Nikhila Gunadeera picked up the ball from the back of the ruck and crashed through mid left for a magnificent try.
Askey slotted the conversion to record a 100% kicking accuracy in this match and Royal further extended their lead to 24-10.
After several minutes the Thomians cut down the lead through a try scored by full back Mayon Jayawardena off a three quarter move. Herath fluffed the conversion and the score read 24-15 in Royals favour.
There were no further scoring done by both the teams in the final few minutes and hence Royal ran out winners to book a berth in Saturdays final (July 9) against this years inter-schools unbeaten league rugby champions Isipathana College.

I want to make my first Olympics a memorable one - Matthew
South Asian Games multiple gold medallist Matthew Abeysinghe said he is delighted to gain Olympic qualifying standards and will make every effort to better his new mark at next months summer Games in Brazil.
Abeysinghe, who became the first-ever Sri Lankan swimmer to reach qualifying standards in the history of Olympic Games, said his next aim is to improve further on his new personal best and make his presence felt at the XXXIst Olympic Games due to commence in Rio de Janeiro on August 5.
In a telephone interview with the Daily News from Hong Kong yesterday, the 20-year-old Lankan champion swimmer said he was looking forward to gain Olympic qualifying standard before the IOC deadline, although his name has been already included in the Sri Lanka contingent for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games as a wildcard entry.
I always wanted to make it to the Olympics by proving my ability, to achieve Olympic qualifying standards and go to Rio as a qualified athlete and not just as a wildcard entry. I have worked hard for this. I am happy that I could achieve my goal in the final meet before the Olympic qualification deadline, said Abeysinghe who had won a record seven gold medals at the last South Asian Games in India early this year.
Abeysinghe created history when he became the first ever Sri Lankan swimmer to achieve Olympic qualifying standards when he clocked 50.53 secs in the mens 100m freestyle event at the Hong Kong Swimming Circuit Championship concluded in Hong Kong yesterday. Although some of the top Lankan swimmers such as Julian Bolling, Condrad Francis and Heshan Unamboowe had represented Sri Lanka at Olympic Games before, all of them have made it through wildcard entries and not by achieving qualifying standards,
Abeysinghes timing in Hong Kong was well inside the Olympic Games qualifying standards for mens 100m freestyle  0.17 seconds ahead. The IOC approved B category qualifying timing for the event is 50.70 seconds. The Lankan swim sensation said his next target is to cut down his timing by around 0.5 seconds.
It will be my first Olympics and I am looking forward to make it a memorable one. My immediate goal is to better the personal best by about half a second, a determined Abeysinghe said.
He is due to return to Colombo today and would continue to train under his father Manoj Abeysinghe who has proven his class as a productive coach of international class.
Besides Abeysinghe, three other Lankan athletes have reached Rio 2016 Olympic qualifying standards - Anuradha Indrajith Cooray (mens marathon), Niluka Rajasekara (womens marathon) and Sumeda Ranasinghe (mens javelin throw).

Death of the Smiling Miler
The local athletics world yesterday mourned the death of Ahmed Sher Mohamed Khan, more famously known as ASM Khan who was dubbed the Smiling Miler by the local media and the Wonder boy of Ceylon by India.
Khan passed away on the 27th night of Ramadan (Saturday) at age of 77 at his residence in Dehiwela and his funeral was held at the Dehiwela Muslim Burial grounds yesterday.
Khan was also referred to as the Local Zatopek of Asia and the Iron Athlete of Ceylon names that were coined to describe his extraordinary running talents.
Khan was the first athlete in Ceylon to run the metric mile under four minutes (3mts, 59.5 secs) in 1960 while still representing his school St Josephs College, Bandarawela. He later joined the CT&FC and Ace AC. He was first selected to represent his country in 1958 in the dual meet between Ceylon and Indian states Madras, Mysore and Bangalore. The meet was held in Bangalore and Khan won the 1500m and 5000m in one day beating some of Indias top athletes. It was at this meet that he got the title the wonder boy of Ceylon from the governor of Bangalore.
More success was to follow when Khan broke the Asian Games record in 1960 in Indonesia running at another international meet clocking 3 mts, 54 secs in the 1500m. He then went to Malaysia and broke their 25-year-old record clocking 4 mts, 19 secs beating athletes from 21 states.
Khan, a middle and long distance athlete was never coached but learnt to run all by himself. He ran for the pleasure of taking part in competition and to be with the best. Unfortunately for an athlete of his talent and calibre his participation was restricted only to Sri Lanka and Asian countries like India, Malaysia and Indonesia. Khan once said that he was denied the opportunity of taking part in the Olympic Games or the Empire Games by the Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) and the National Olympic Committee (NOC) of that time.
He represented his alma mater at athletics, boxing and soccer before pursuing a career in athletics that was to make him famous. For three years he was unbeaten ABA champion in the pin weight class and earned the name the tiger fighter from the mountain area. He was also very good at soccer playing for his school as well as for Municipality B team where he was a playground instructor.
Khan quit competitive athletics in 1966 and took off to Jeddah where he worked for the Saudi Arabian Airlines for 27 years. He was the first Sri Lankan to join the Airlines.
At that time our country was known as Ceylon. They didnt know where Ceylon was in the map, Khan said in an interview.
He worked in the head office as secretary to the manager flight operations and quit as senior secretary.
At the time of his death Khan was a successful gem merchant travelling to Saudi Arabia often to advise the prince and princesses and sheikhs who sort his expertise and consulted him before they purchased a gem stone.
Khan bestrode the local and Asian athletic world like a colossus taking everything before him in an era where sportsmen and women took part for glory and pride. Khan is survived by his wife and two sons.

ICC approves changes to DRS lbw law
The ICC has approved changes to the lbw umpires call in the DRS playing conditions, with the conclusion of its annual conference in Edinburgh on Saturday.
For on-field lbw decisions to be overturned, half of the ball would now need to hit a zone of the stumps that also borders the outside of off and leg stumps. Earlier, half of the ball would need to hit a zone between the centre of off and leg stumps.
An ICC release said: The size of the zone inside which half the ball needs to hit for a Not Out decision to be reversed to Out will increase, changing to a zone bordered by the outside of off and leg stumps, and the bottom of the bails (formerly the centre of off and leg stumps, and the bottom of the bails).
The amendment will come into effect from October 1 or from the start of any series using DRS that commences just prior to this date.
The change will benefit bowlers and more batsmen will be given out once on-field decisions are referred as the zone the ball needs to hit for the decision to be overturned has increased.
In a decision concerning calling of no-balls, the ICC will arrange a trial in the coming months to assess if the third umpire could use instant replays to call no-balls more accurately. The trial is likely to take place during an upcoming ODI series and the third umpire will judge no-balls within a few seconds of the ball being delivered and communicate it to the on-field umpire.

FFSL annual report and final accounts approved unanimously
The Annual Report and Final Account Report of the Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL) for the year 2015 were unanimously approved by the FFSL membership during the Special General Meeting held at the Football House recently. The meeting did not last long as the proceedings were concluded within 45 minutes.
Due to investigations over many complaints of monetary transactions of FFSL, the Audit Report by the Auditor Generals Department has not been issued as yet for 2015.
The Special General Meeting was held after president of Negombo Football League and FFSL Monitary Committee chairman Ranjith Rodrigo requested FFSL to do so as they must clarify its situation to its members before someone takes legal action against the body.
After considering this situation FFSL decided to distribute the Annual Report and Final Accounts amongst its members, said FFSL president Anura de Silva. He also said that this action will prevent FFSL being exposed to allegations and legal action by any member, so the federation will save money on unnecessary legal expenditure.
FFSL faced many judicial cases in the past. We spent a lot of money over them. The Financial Committee president and federation worked foresightedly. We want to develop football, we are not afraid of baseless allegations, we will initiate many projects to uplift the sport and make it a success, De Silva further said. Five new football academies will be formed in Galle, Matara, Hatton, Badulla and Kelaniya. These projects will receive international aids. These facilities will meet international standards and will include boarding facilities, educational assistance in Maths, English and IT subjects, soccer training under expert coaches. The International Football Federation has increased their aid this year and we can fulfill our targets, the FFSL president added.
