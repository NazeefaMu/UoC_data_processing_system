Delay of billions in tax Refunds slows Indias exports
Four months after Indias biggest tax overhaul, traders are still waiting for 500 billion rupees ($7.7 billion) they say the government owes them in refunds, leaving them short of operating capital as overseas sales suffer.
Its an alarming situation, said A. Sakthivel, regional chairman of the Federation of Indian Exporters Organisation in southern India. "Our working capital is stuck, were losing revenues and now were having to let workers go." More than 10,000 workers have lost their jobs in the Tirupur export hub that employs half a million in the state of Tamil Nadu, according to Sakthivel.
Indias exports dipped for the first time in 15 months this October, falling 1.1 percent to $23.1 billion, even as the government tinkered with ways to simplify the hurriedly implemented nationwide goods and services tax. While last months trade deficit widened the most in three years to $14 billion, exports are expected to fall further in November if prices of crude oil, Indias biggest import, continue to climb, traders say.
The decline in exports combined with the slowing of Indias $2.3 trillion economy contrasts with the accelerating global economy. With elections due in key states over the next few months, including Prime Minister Narendra Modis home state of Gujarat -- Indias second-most industrialized state with annual exports worth $60 billion -- his government faces the twin challenges of restoring business and saving informal sector jobs.

Dengue vaccine trials go awry
A total of 32 schoolchildren from ten countries in the world were infected with the dengue virus after receiving the dengue vaccine, which is now undergoing phase two clinical trials. Out of them, 29 are Sri Lankans, Health Services Director General Dr. J. M. W. Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo, yesterday, he said that the dengue vaccine is now undergoing clinical trials in ten countries including in Sri Lanka, and the vaccine had been given to around 20,000 schoolchildren. There are three centres in Sri Lanka connected to the ongoing clinical trial.
According to Dr. Bandara, for the first time in Sri Lankan history, the total number of dengue patients exceeded 100,000 in July and around 9,000 dengue patients were reported as the midnight total. But the country was able to cut down the percentage of persons infected with dengue by 90 percent within five weeks, due to the huge contribution made by the mass media and the entire country.
Dr. Bandara pointed out that the health authorities expected a significant increase in the number of dengue patients due to the present rainy weather. But the number of dengue patients increased only slightly, due to the various programmes implemented countrywide with the assistance of the media in the recent past. Yesterday, around 1,400 dengue patients were reported from all parts of the country.

Diagnosing western medicine
There are two new branches of western medicine  Autoimmunology and Epigenetics. Autoimmunology is the science/study of the origin of and effects arising from our immunity system continuously attacking the very body it is meant to protect. Epigenetics is the science/study of the origin of and effects arising from nongenetic influences on gene expression. This subject is not germane to this series.
Autoimmunology is believed to be the underlying mechanism of almost every known degenerative disease. It is a process by which your own immunity system is destroying your body  not because it has gone out of control, but because you yourself are continuously feeding your body with materials that trigger the IS into action. Diseases such as Lupus, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Ulcerative Colitis, Crohns Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Diabetes, degenerative brain diseases including Alzheimers and Parkinsons, Psoriasis are now said to be autoimmune diseases [AIDs]. Difficult to believe on the basis of current Medicine So it is.
AID can be detected about 5 years before any symptoms are detected, but that does not happen. The present-day medicine treats the symptoms when they appear; the symptoms are regarded as specific diseases and treated accordingly either killing the symptoms and suggesting a cure or worsening the disease. Functional medicine, on the other hand, recognizes the autoimmune reaction and treats the cause not the symptoms. Sometimes it is just a matter of removing or avoiding some foods, chemicals or pollutants from your lifestyle.
Autoimmunology can be regarded as an adjunct of Functional Medicine. Both are based on research and experience of many eminent medical professionals. To name just a few,
Professor Yehudi Shoenfeld, MD, FRCP [Hons] from Israel, respected as the godfather of Predictive Autoimmunity.
Dr. Jeffrey Bland, PhD, respected as the godfather of Functional Medicine [FM]
Dr. Mark Hyman, MD, respected as the introducer of FM to the famous Cleveland Clinic, USA
Dr. Michael Ash, DO, ND, BSc, respected as an expert on the microbiome
There are hundreds of others including many who are as highly qualified and experienced as the above-named. They all are, very definitely, not quacks.
Silent killers
Most people have sensitivities to various foods, drinks, chemicals and other pollutants. Such sensitivities are due to the individual genetic build-up. They show up in some people with allergies while they do not show up or are hardly noticeable in others. Allergies must be viewed in a deeper way. Merely treating with antihistamines is a temporary cure. People who do not show up allergies can have unknown sensitivities. Unfortunately, such sensitivities can be silent killers.
We are sensitive to a wide range of substances to which our grandparents were either immune or did not encounter. That shows that our bodies are genetically changing to adapt to our current environment and losing the battle resulting in autoimmune reaction and early death. The fact is that the changes in the environment are multi-fold and taking place at a pace too fast to be followed and countered by the body  resulting in autoimmune action leading to degenerative diseases.
We, the uninitiated, can accept this science. It synchronizes with what we already know. It is common knowledge that there is reactive oxygen in the environment and, that it can enter our bodies via inhalation, food, contaminants etc. and that it can damage cells. That is why we are exhorted to take antioxidants.
Body cells are continuously replaced. Some in a few days, some in seven years. In this way, one gets a new body every seven years or so, but unfortunately, by that time most other cells are old. As such you do not feel young every seven years. Cell damage can take place at the very beginning of cell formation, during its conversion to specific cells such as bone cells, muscle cells, specific organ cells etc. , and at the converted cell stage. The damaged cell does not act according to the genetic message it acquired as a healthy cell; it does not perform the function it was meant to do. As a mutated cell, it has an altered message and it acts accordingly thereby forming foreign organs or growths - cancers. Similarly, damaged cells can cause other degenerative diseases.
Immune system
In the good old days, environmental pollution was not even heard of, but even so, there was reactive oxygen. This was at a very low level in general. The immune system could easily handle and overcome reactive oxygen then. As a result, our grandparents were healthy. Now we are suffocating in pollution. We are overwhelmed by air pollution; we are overwhelmed by equally serious pollution of food, water and soil too. Our immune system is overwhelmed. Most people do not bother to protect themselves by taking well-prepared antioxidants and clean antioxidant-rich vegetables and fruits. Even that is inadequate. One has to be careful about ones sensitivities too.
There are numerous descriptions of what seem to be miraculous cures for serious diseases through Functional Medicine. But the diagnoses and cures are very commonplace. Just to illustrate this statement I shall relate just one episode from many because of restrictions of space.
The narrator is one of the main promoters of Autoimmunology and Functional Medicine, a doctor with qualifications DC, CCN, DACBN and a world-renowned expert on gluten-related disorders.
His father died suddenly, assumed to be from a heart attack. After an autopsy, the chief pathologist of Detroit, a family friend, called to inform that the death was not due to a clot, that the deceased had only 30% blockage in a particular coronary artery called the Widow Maker  which was insufficient to cause death, that toxicology screening results were negative, that he had no needle marks on his body and a lung biopsy did not show inhalation of any toxic substance  and as such, for the second time in his career he does not know the cause of death.
That led the narrator to start his own research. He found that the cause of death was undetected high homocysteine levels  a condition called Elevated Homocysteine Levels [EHL]. It is caused by an insufficiency or high deficiency of Vitamin B, which in turn was caused by inflammation of the gut due to gluten from wheat, which the deceased ate every day. The condition is called Celiac Disease. And the good news is that EHL can be eliminated by an intake of Vitamin B for about three weeks and later provide it to the body on a regular basis through food or supplements.

Dumindas appeal fixed for argument
The appeal petitions, filed by five accused including former Defence Ministry Monitoring MP Duminda Silva, challenging the judgement of the Colombo High Court, was yesterday fixed for March 29 by the Supreme Court.
Five accused, including former Defence Ministry Monitoring MP Duminda Silva, who were sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court for committing the murder of four persons including former MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra, had filed appeal petitions in the Supreme Court challenging the judgement of the Colombo High Court.
When the matter came up before the three-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare and Justice Vijith Malalgoda, the appeals were fixed for argument on March 29.
On a previous occasion, Duminda Silva, the eleventh accused in the murder case, filed an acceleration petition in the Supreme Court requesting that the hearing on the appeal be accelerated on medical grounds. These appeals are to be heard before a five-judge-bench of the Supreme Court on the next date.
Through his appeal, Duminda Silva stated that he was seeking the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to review and set aside their conviction and the death sentence imposed by the High Court on September 8, 2015. Five accused including former MP Duminda Silva were on September 8, 2015 sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court for committing the murder of four persons including former MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra on October 8, 2011.
However, the verdict was divided two to one with judges Pathmini N. Ranawaka and M.C.B.S. Moreis finding the five accused guilty of 10 charges including committing and conspiring to commit the murder of four people while Justice Shiran Gunaratne, the President of Colombo High Court Trial-at-Bar, found the 13 accused not guilty of all 17 charges.

Exclusively for book buddies
To the many literati in Colombo who are not part of this exclusive club, it may come as a surprise that SCOR (a silent community of readers) literary salon since February, 2009, hosted their 60th event in October, 2017, at the Mansion, Movenpick Hotel.
SCOR, which was initially known among its pioneering members as Sarrahs Book Club, began in February 2009. When Namalie Menikdiwela, an avid reader and true literary enthusiast, joined the group, the soiree was held more frequently.
Since then the book club with the support of a few passionate readers has hosted many international and local authors and special guests.
Think of it as an underground club where literary lovers casually meet for some vino, finger food and banter on books, said Member Literati Roshini Galappati. Its where we come to for our sporadic literary fix and each meet up has never failed to satiate our literary yearnings.
SCOR Founder Sarrah Sammoon invited author Chhimi Tenduf-La for the 60th celebration at The Mansion. The session was opened by Movenpick General Manager, Markus Marti. The celebratory discussion was on Chhimis latest book Loyal Stalkers.
Prior to the event, Chhimi said: SCOR was the first book club I have been to as an author and I will soon be back for my third visit.
I absolutely love their events, as they are always incredibly well organised and catered. They have managed to bring together a group of superbly intelligent and appreciative readers who ask wonderful questions and have insights into my books I had not thought of myself. When I first release a book, if I get SCOR's approval, it gives me great confidence. They are all so supportive and keen to help authors and they have become very important to Colombo's literary landscape.
SCOR has also been privileged to have had the opportunity to gift Chhimi Tenduf- Las Amazing Racist to the Dalai Lama during his 80th birthday given Chhimis Tibetan heritage.
The SCOR Literary Salon They feed you like a king, they ply you with drink. Then with great precision they extract your deepest darkest secrets. Its like going to the dentist  only a whole lot more fun.
The salon engages conversation on trending topics and issues which effect people around the work, thus in August; the pick was Colson Whiteheads Underground Railroad. SCOR also believes in engaging a diverse set of Guest Speakers to join the conversation: in September, International Speaker and Public Speaking Coach, Amlie Yan-Gouiffs from France, took the patrons through Dr Brian Weiss Many Masters Many Lives in person.
Paulo Coelho posted the groups photos on his social media when they discussed The Alchemist and wrote to the group: The contact with my readers gives me joy and strength to continue my work. Keep on fighting for what is important to you and to the world! In October, when the group took on A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara, she thanked SCOR on Instagram.
International authors that have joined the conversation via skype in the past include authors Kimberley McCreight, Corban Addison, Joe Baker, Rosalyn DMello and Shankari Chandran to name a few. SCOR announces that their final December session will be their Christmas Soiree and they will have Author Alexandria Marzano-Lesnevich to discuss The Fact of a Body.
Sarrah Sammoon, SCOR Founder cum female entrepreneur, strongly believes that the literary salon plays a huge part in helping readers to commit to books, discussions help people grow personally, the networking develops relationships and on the whole it is good for the mind, body and soul.
"I love the SCOR Lit Salon. They are some of the most engaged and passionate readers I've met in the country and I always look forward to discussing my books with them when I'm in Sri Lanka." - Author Nayomi Munaweera
I love SCOR - they are who I publish for! - Publisher Sam Perera
SCOR - where I found my way back home to the world of books . - Reader Upeka Peiris
SCOR Silent Community of Readers is most certainly THE book club in Colombo, with a wide-ranging membership with eclectic tastes, hence the diversity of the books they discuss from various authors around the world and Sri Lanka. Congratulations SCOR! For being a serious impact on Colombo's reading populace! - Shyamalee Tudawe

Exports surpass US$ 1 bn again
The external sector performance was driven by a double digit growth in exports (year-on-year) in September 2017, surpassing the US$ 1 billion mark of monthly exports for the third consecutive month. However, the trade deficit expanded with higher imports of fuel and rice during the month.
Earnings from tourism declined moderately during the month with a slightly lower number of tourist arrivals from key destinations compared to September 2016. The moderation in workers remittances continued in September, resulting in a noteworthy decline in workers remittances in the first nine months of 2017.
However, reflecting continuous investor confidence, the financial account of the Balance of Payments (BOP) continued to strengthen during the month with higher foreign inflows to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and the government securities market.
Subsequently, the overall balance recorded a surplus of US$ 2.0 billion by end September 2017. Meanwhile, gross official reserves increased to US$ 7.3 billion as at end September 2017 from US$ 6.0 billion as at end 2016.
The deficit in the trade balance widened in September 2017 while the cumulative trade deficit during the first nine months of 2017 also expanded when compared with the corresponding period of the previous year. This was mainly due to the additional import expenditure incurred due to the prevailed drought condition in the country.
Earnings from exports which grew since March 2017 continued its increasing trend in September 2017 as well.
This growth was mainly led by higher earnings from industrial exports owing to the increase in exports of textiles and garments as a result of improved garment exports to both the USA and EU market. In addition, earnings from rubber products rose reflecting higher earnings from rubber tyres and surgical and other gloves.

Meanwhile, earnings from agricultural exports continued to increase in September 2017 from the beginning of the year.
This was due to the improved performance in tea, owing to higher prices in the international market and a marginal growth in export volumes. Earnings from spices also increased considerably due to higher export volumes of pepper, cloves and cinnamon.
Reflecting the positive impact of the removal of the ban on exports of fisheries products to the EU market and the restoration of the GSP+ facility, earnings from seafood exports increased considerably with a 153% year-on-year growth in exports to the EU market.
However, earnings from transport equipment declined considerably in September 2017 vis--vis September 2016 reflecting the base effect of exportation of a cruise ship to Singapore in September 2016. The USA, the UK, India, Italy and Germany were the leading markets for merchandise exports of Sri Lanka in September 2017, accounting for about 51% of total exports.
Expenditure on imports increased in September 2017, recording a double digit growth for the third consecutive month as a result of higher expenditure incurred on intermediate goods, particularly fuel. Expenditure on fuel imports increased significantly due to the combined effect of high prices in the international market and higher volumes of fuel imported for thermal based power generation.
Despite the slower than expected improvement in the current account, the financial account of the BOP was strengthened during the month of September with continuous foreign inflows. Continuing the positive trend witnessed since March 2017, foreign investments to the government securities market recorded net inflows for the seventh consecutive month reflecting positive investor sentiment.
Meanwhile, foreign investments in the CSE recorded a net outflow (including both secondary and primary market foreign exchange flows) during the month of September, mainly due to a one-off transaction of a Sri Lankan conglomerate acquiring the foreign stake of a company operating in Sri Lanka.
As at end September 2017, Sri Lankas gross official reserves increased to US dollars 7.3 billion, equivalent to 4.2 months of imports.

Free shoes for low income Govt. school children
Ministry of Education has taken steps to provide free pairs of shoes to low-income government school students in remote and isolated schools countrywide.
For this purpose, the Ministry has allocated a sum of Rs. 808.27 million this year.
Government spent about Rs. 592 million for supplying of free shoes to students last year (2016) and about 621,941 students were thus benefitted accordingly last year.
Last year, shoes were provided to deserving students at their own schools by incurring heavy transport and other expenses and it was proved to be a somewhat complex and time-consuming procedure.
Hence, the students are to be awarded with cash vouchers this year instead, to purchase their own shoes.
These vouchers are priced between Rs. 1200 and Rs.1,500 in their face values, said Education Minister and Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, when he was contacted by Daily News on November 27 from Kurunegala.

Going Home Without Seeing the Play..!
The audience troops into the theatre, and walks behind the ushers who help them to their seats. They sit expectantly, looking at the curtain, and suddenly see it turning red, then blue, then yellow, and in a few seconds, the colours intermingle, becoming one.
A single rainbow streak going along into the sky! Wow! cry the people, Wow!
They sit mesmerized and watch the shimmering curtain cloth transforming itself, entertaining them and they scream with pleasure.
They sit through the whole show, watching that same curtain, laughing, chuckling, grinning, smiling as sometimes the ruffian red, oftimes the brigand blue, moves from the top and envelopes the yellow.
They watch as impish yellow tried to get away and blue chases it, then splashes herself all over red.
The audience rise at the end of the show and make their way home.
How was the play ask their sons, daughters, friends.
Play they ask. There was no play!
But you went to see a play
The curtain was more interesting! The green going into the yellow! And so funny when red crashed into the blue!
Didnt the curtain open ask those who had seen them going to the theatre.
No!
But werent you interested in seeing what was happening on stage, behind the curtain
The curtain was interesting enough! smile the people, Whos interested in seeing anything behind!
And in a stage called the World, the same seems to be happening: Theres a play going on, actors and actresses acting their part, doing their roles, voicing their lines. Their faces filled with anger, their speeches with racial, religious and communal hate.
They stick their swords and daggers, not wooden swords and daggers given to them in the original script, but real ones, made of steel, or deadlier ones, made of hateful speech, which they thrust onto unsuspecting crowds who wounded cry and shout and look at us the audience for support. But we the audience sit impassive, laughing, giggling, smiling, interested only in watching the curtain.
Yes, the curtain of the North Korean leaders rants, the curtain of Trumps tweets, the curtain of TV channels full of tripe and clever WhatSapp cartoons and videos lampooning world leaders, amuse and entertain, keeping us occupied, as those behind the same entertaining cloth, fall fatally wounded, are kicked, lynched, raped and murdered!
Nobody asks: Doesnt todays generation have more mass killing during peacetimes than ever before
Isnt there lots of communal tension after the present governments have come in
Shouldnt we stop killings in Syria Isnt there trouble brewing in the Middle East
But we stare only at the curtain. Fooled into silly anger; whether Trump should be more moderate, gulled into watching the British PMs jostling and turning, while what is happening behind the curtain, ceases to interest us anymore!
Are we, you and I, going home, without seeing the play

Habaradoowa railway station opened
The new railway station at Habaradoowa, which was established as a part of a project launched by the Sri Lanka Railway Department to enhance facilitations for train users, was handed over to the public by Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva and Minister Chandima Weerakkody, yesterday.
The new railway station, which is worth Rs. 12 million, replaces the old Habaradoowa train station which had only one platform and will facilitate about 5,000 passengers who use the train daily.
Addressing the gathering, Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva said the new railway station was established as a transportation hub. He observed that the Three-wheeler park, the taxi park, and the bus stand are all inter-connected with the new train station. He also said there is no party politics for development in the country, and these facilities can be utilized by the general public. Minister Siripala De Silva also said that all railway stations will be developed in the same manner where transportation services will be in one center. Minister De Silva pointed out that Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka has proposed a large scale transportation hub as well.
He also requested the Railway Authorities to look into similar modern methods which will be practically applicable to Sri Lanka in order to improve the transportation system in the country.
The Kalutara South - Payagala South seven-kilometer double railway line, together with the Railway Signal System, was also opened for service at this event.
The government has spent Rs. 975 million for the project.
The Railway Department plans to build a double railway line from Payagala to Aluthgama as well.

House of Cards 'hopes to resume soon' - without Kevin Spacey

House of Cards could be soon returning to production following the sexual harassment and assault allegations made against its star, Kevin Spacey.
The hit Netflix show was forced to take a break following the claims and Spacey has now been dropped from the show.
Pauline Micelli, senior vice president at the show's studio, Media Rights Capital, recently wrote to staff to say its hiatus was being extended.
"We continue to work with Netflix with the hope of resuming production soon."
Crew on the show will be paid until 8 December "as we continue these discussions," her letter went on.
Netflix previously announced it "will not be involved with any further production of House of Cards that includes Kevin Spacey".
'Loyal and talented'
Ms Micelli's letter addressed how stressful a period it had been for everyone working on the show.
"These last two months have tested and tried all of us in ways none of us could have foreseen," she wrote.
"The one thing we have learned throughout this process is that this production is bigger than just one person and we could not be more proud to be associated with one of the most loyal and talented production cast and crews in this business."
In the letter, published in theHollywood Reporter, she added: "Our hope is that the entire crew will be able to reconvene when production resumes.
"But we want you to know that we will certainly understand if crew members need to find other work in the interim, which will prevent them from re-joining us. We sincerely appreciate all you have done".
She said that the writers would be continuing their work during the hiatus - presumably working on how to write Spacey out.
'Deeply inappropriate'
Spacey, who was artistic director at London's Old Vic theatre, is currently being investigated by Scotland Yard over two allegations of sexual assault.
He also faces claims of "on-set sexual misconduct" by members of the House of Cards production crew.
Initial allegations about Spacey were made by actor Anthony Rapp in October.
Rapp said he was 14 when Spacey allegedly harassed him following a party in 1986.
Spacey claimed to have no memory of the alleged incident whileoffering an apology to Rapp"for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour".
The Old Vic has saidthat an internal investigation found 20 people claimed they had been the victims of inappropriate behaviour by Spacey, who was at the theatre between 2004 and 2015.
A spokesperson for Spacey said the Oscar-winning actor has been "taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment" since the allegations surfaced.

India to rest star Kohli
Nagpur: Indias captain and star batsman Virat Kohli will be rested for the one-day matches against Sri Lanka after the ongoing Test series ends, selectors said Monday.
Kohli has stepped up calls in recent weeks for a break from cricket because of the workload. India, the worlds top Test nation, start a demanding tour of South Africa in January.
Im not a robot, you can slice my skin and check if I still bleed, Kohli said before the Sri Lanka series started.
He has played more international cricket in 2017 than any other Indian player -- nine Tests, 26 one-day internationals and 10 T20s.
India will go into the third and final Test against Sri Lanka in New Delhi on Saturday with Kohli leading the squad that hammered the visitors in the second Test.
The return of batsman Shikhar Dhawan, who opted out of the second Test due to personal reasons, is the only change.
The squad for the South Africa tour is to be named before the game starts.
Kohli will be replaced as captain by batsman Rohit Sharma for the three-match one day series after the Tests.
Sharma, who hit 102 not out in the Nagpur Test, is expected to remain captain for the T20 games too, as Kohli rests and prepares for the South Africa tour.
Allrounder Hardik Pandya and fast bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who pulled out of the second and third Sri Lanka Test to get married, return to the 15-man squad.
Uncapped fast bowler Siddarth Kaul and young batsmen Shreyas Iyer, who has represented India in three T20 games, are also part of the one-day team.
Senior spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja continue to stay out of Indias limited-overs plans despite their superb run in the five-day format.
Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal remain the teams three spinners in the 50-over matches against Sri Lanka.
The first of the three ODIs will be played in Dharamsala on December 10. AFP

ITC SheTrades and EDB to hold workshop for women-owned/led SMEs
In collaboration with EDB, the ITC SheTrades Project Economic Empowerment of Women in the Indian Ocean Rim Association Countries (IORA Project) will organize a workshop for 100 women-owned/-led small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Sri Lanka. The workshop will take place on November 29 from 8.30 am to 5.00 pm at the EDB auditorium.
The workshop aims to increase women entrepreneurs financial literacy and legal awareness, two of the most crucial bottlenecks faced by women businesses in the country. This workshop will be held within the scope of ITCs SheTrades global initiative that aims to connect one million women entrepreneurs to market by 2020.
Women-owned/-led businesses represent between one-quarter and one-third of enterprises in the world, but are largely invisible in the global value chains. Research has shown that fewer women are engaged in international trade than businesses owned by men. Women-owned/-led businesses often have less number of employees and lack the resources to expand into international markets. In addition, cultural and legal barriers largely contribute for the under representation of women-owned/-led businesses in international trade.
Efforts by women entrepreneurs to enter global value chains and upgrade their businesses into higher value activities are restricted by several factors. For instance, limited access to finance poses more constraints to women than men, since women have less assets and reputational collateral to access finance. Thus, it is essential to facilitate better access to finance for women-owned/-led businesses to expand their businesses to reach to international markets.
Another common barrier faced by women-led SMEs is the limited access to legal information. Higher consultancy charges for legal advice and lack of awareness about the regulatory frameworks related to businesses act as discouraging factors for the women to seek legal consultation related to business activities.
Funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Government of Australia (DFAT), ITC SheTrades is organizing the workshop in collaboration with the EDB, as well as the Hatton National Bank of Sri Lanka and the D.L. & F. De Saram Legal Advisors, which will provide their representatives as resource persons.
Women-owned/-led SMEs are highly encouraged to participate in this workshop. More information could be obtained from emails [emailprotected] and Vajira Kularathna at [emailprotected].

The Jury speaks
The judgment was not easy. It took hours. Any jury member will experience such an entanglement owing to the conflict of interest in personal choices. For the Jury of the recently concluded SAARC Film Festival, however, it was not that hard. They have known each other taking part in many film festivals before.
Antnio Costa Valente from Portugal, Anne Dmy-Geroe from Australia and Amir Masoud Soheili from Iran knew each other well, despite varied tastes, concerns, likes and dislikes. They brainstormed all that for hours and broke down the reasons to come to a conclusion. And finally, they reached consensus.
With a doctorate in cinema, Antnio Costa Valente lectures at the University of Aveiro, UTAD. Dr Valente also teaches cinema at other universities in Austria, Brazil, El Salvador, Spain, USA, France, Ireland, Japan, Morocco, United Kingdom, Sao Tome and Principe and Switzerland. He has produced and co-directed the first Portuguese animated feature film To the Top of the World. Anne Dmy-Geroe, a film curator cum expert of Asian cinema teaches Asia Pacific Cinema at Griffith Film School. She is a co-Director of the Iranian Film Festival Australia, an inaugural member of the Nominations Council for the Asia Pacific Screen Awards, a Vice President of NETPAC - the Network for the Promotion of Asia Pacific Cinema, and a Co-Director of APSL - Asia Pacific Screen Lab.
Amir Masoud Soheili has earned global reputation, having taken part in hundreds of film festivals around the world as a director as well as a jury member. He is widely known in the cinema fraternity for his short films. Soheili, the youngest member of the SAARC Film Festival 2017 Jury, speaks to the Daily News offers his analysis on the festival.
It was really difficult to select the most special film. All the films were good. Our discussion dragged on for hours. Finally, we settled down for Pinkey Beauty Parlour because we could see everything consummate there. Directing, writing, acting and music was simply perfect. The movie made a real impression, Soheili elaborated why Akshay Singhs debut film Pinkey Beauty Parlour, which opened the festival, was given the Special Jury Award.
A festival is quite resourceful for any filmmaker. The films will be screened before a special audience and a jury. Meeting fellow filmmakers is a bonus benefit of taking part in a film festival. While commenting positively about film festivals, Soheili nevertheless had his own concerns.
They have a particular taste. They have a particular concern. The filmmakers try to base their productions on the festival objectives. Then they lose their own theme for the sake of festivals. This makes the filmmaker forget about the general audience.
Yet a filmmaker needs festivals to flourish. The master class, held during the festival, enlightened the up and coming filmmakers on the methodology of submitting their cinema entries to international film festivals.
A few years ago, even the short films were unthinkable. But now it is possible largely thanks to the DSLR camera and high-resolution smartphones. Many filmmakers enter the industry with their first attempt at a short film. It is the easiest way to enter the mainstream cinema. A lot of festivals also encourage short films. The short films have many avenues open. Online channels are one of them. You can also earn some money.
With short film as his main forte, Soheili is trying to experience different elements in cinema. Among the similarities shared across the South Asian region, Soheili attempts to explore the subtle differences.
It is a challenging experience. But we need to bridge the cultures in Asia. Cinema is the best medium to execute that.
Long before Soheili reached Sri Lanka, he was familiar with the islands cinema territory. Recalling his acquaintance with Vimukthi Jayasundera a few years ago, Soheili noted that he learned a lot from his Lankan counterpart.
Most South Asian countries have a problem with finding their own way of storytelling and filmmaking. Most countries of the South Asian region tend to follow the Bollywood style. Yet, I have observed that Sri Lankan cinema has its own voice. The Sri Lankan filmmakers have found their own voice. Filmmaking seems to be quite established in Sri Lanka whereas most other countries try to imitate either Hollywood or Bollywood style.
Soheili has his own reservations about the festivals.
I am a bit concerned about the way the films had been selected. We had no chance to watch a Bhutanese film, for one. And most other countries have chosen the commercial films. The films had been nominated by the government, thats good. But these countries have produced better films. It looks like they havent searched extensively. All the SAARC countries have short films as well, though only a few countries cared to submit them.
Soheili is hopeful that the SAARC Film Festival will rise to a richer plain of cinema experience in its 2018 edition.
Amir Masoud Soheili is an internationally awarded short filmmaker who has participated in hundreds of festivals around the world as a director and a jury member. He has been one of the seven most honoured Iranian short filmmakers in 2015. He has been working for more than ten years in the film industry as an Assistant Director. He has also proven his talent for writing scripts such as This is the deed Mr. Doctor! (Short film 2010), Pari (Short film 2015) and Loved her like a sister (short film 2016) produced by other filmmakers.

Keep backing yourselves, Root tells beaten England
Brisbane: Captain Joe Root has urged his players to keep backing themselves as Ashes holders England head into a crucial second Test after their demoralising loss to Australia at the Gabba.
The Australians romped to an emphatic 10-wicket victory early on the fifth day in Brisbane after breaking free of an attritional opening three days, leaving questions for the tourists over the remaining four Tests.
England's inability to capitalise on a strong start in the first innings -- where they crashed from 246 for four to 302 all out -- and a below-par 195 in the second innings cost them any winning chance in Brisbane.
"We've got to keep believing and trusting the work we've been doing, and backing ourselves and backing each other as a group," said Root, on whom much depends with the bat and team strategy.
"For three days we played some excellent cricket. Unfortunately, when we got into good positions, we didn't quite capitalise on it."
The series now heads to the Adelaide Oval for the first-ever day-night Ashes Test, starting on Saturday, where England cannot afford to lose again.
Root defended his elaborate fielding placements at the Gabba for Australia's master batsman Steve Smith, who turned the Test with a painstaking unbeaten 141 over eight-and-a-half hours to give his side a narrow but crucial innings lead.
His field strategy for Smith was likened to Bodyline, a notorious leg theory bowling tactic devised by England on their 1932-33 tour of Australia to counter the great Don Bradman.
The England skipper placed six fielders on the leg-side with three in the deep and no one in front of the bat on the off-side as his pacemen ripped in short-pitched deliveries to Smith for a time.
"We made him (Smith) work extremely hard for his runs. Credit to him, he played extremely well," Root said.
"Sometimes you've got to say well played to the opposition."
Root, ranked the world's second-best Test batsman, was out leg before wicket in both innings at the Gabba for 15 and 51, but is confident of making big scores in the rest of the series.
"I feel like I've got a good understanding of how I play and I'll make sure that I prepare very well in terms of getting ready," Root said.
England coach Trevor Bayliss said he was confident the tourists will bounce back.
"Adelaide I don't think there will be any problem at all," Bayliss said.
"Unfortunately, we've been in this situation before over the last few years where we've put in a bad performance but we were able to come back from it."

Suffer their heaviest Test loss in history
Lankan batsmen commit hara-kiri on batting surface
NAGPUR, Monday: Sri Lankas nightmares with their batting persisted as they put up another feeble display on a pitch that hardly was of assistance to the bowlers to be shot out for 166 to lose the second Test against India inside four days by an innings and 239 runs and suffer their heaviest defeat in history at the Vidarbha CA Stadium in Jamtha here today.
The win meant that India not only took a 1-0 lead in the three-match Test series with one to play but also equalled their largest Test win which was against Bangladesh in Dhaka in 2007 by the same margin. The first Test played at Kolkata ended in a draw and the third and final Test commences at Delhi on December 2.
The way the Lankans are playing they are turning out to be hardly a team that can compete at this level of cricket. Losing is one thing but the manner in which they are doing so is simply dreadful. This is not the Lankan teams that we have seen in the past where despite losing to India they have put up sterling batting performances.
This team simply does lack the class and the strong mentality to outlast the opponent. Pakistan was a different kettle of fish. They were struggling with their middle order batting following the retirements of Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq and Sri Lankan bowlers capitalised on that weakness to fashion out a 2-0 win. But India the no. 1 ranked Test team is with hardly any chinks in their armour and, Sri Lanka with their limited resources and inexperience on their side proved hardly a match for them.
Having said that, some of the top order batsmen were at fault for surrendering their wickets without a fight playing some appalling strokes as if they were chasing runs to win a match. Sadeera Samarawickrama playing in only his third Test can be excused for the manner in which he got out misjudging a delivery from Ishant Sharma and getting bowled but the rest have to take the responsibility for this debacle.
The strokes that Lahiru Thirimanne played in both innings that led to his dismissal is hardly that of a number three batsman. A number 3 of any Test team is the most important batsman in your team and at present Thirimanne for all the rave comments he has received about his technique and temperament has not fulfilled that requirement.
Over the years Sri Lanka has been served by some top class no. 3 batters starting from Roy Dias downwards through to Asanka Gurusinha, the present cricket manager of the team to Kumar Sangakkara, the most prolific run-getter in Sri Lankas Test history.
Former captain Angelo Mathews the most experienced batter in the line-up is simply not at his best and his lack of contribution to the team is certainly hurting them a lot.
Only skipper Dinesh Chandimal stood tall among the pile of wickets that fell around him scoring his 15th Test fifty and third against India and his second in the match. He and tailender Suranga Lakmal saved Sri Lanka the ignominy of losing the Test before lunch by putting together a stand of 58 off 68 balls in an extended morning session that saw seven wickets fall for 124 runs.
However their liaison for the ninth wicket only delayed the inevitable but at least it proved one thing that there were no terrors on the pitch and that if you applied yourselves you could score runs on it.
Chandimal finally fell pulling a Yadav delivery to long leg to be caught for 61 scored off 82 balls with 10 fours and Ashwin wrapped up the innings and the match by bowling last man Lahiru Gamage to become the fastest bowler in Test history to take 300 wickets playing in his 54th Test beating Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee by two Tests. Ashwin took 4 for 63 in the second innings and eight wickets in the match.
Virat Kohli was named Man of the Match.
Sri Lanka skipper Dinesh Chandimal played a lone hand to score his second half-centuryof the Test but it was not enough to save his side from their heaviest defeat.

MindShare wins 'Top of the Category' at SMARTIES Global Awards
Proving their mettle once more, MindShare, a unit of GroupM Media Private Limited clinched the Silver award in the (MESSAGING CATEGORY) for the Softlogic Life flood relief SMS based platform campaign at the SMARTIES Global Awards 2017 organized by the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) and held in New York City, USA. SMARTIES Global Awards honours innovation, creativity and effectiveness of mobile marketing campaigns. This year the award carries special significance as there were no Gold award winners in this category. The MMA is the worlds leading global non-profit trade association comprising of over 800 member companies, from nearly fifty countries around the world. The members hail from every faction of the mobile marketing ecosystem including brand marketers, agencies, mobile technology platforms, media companies and operators.
This achievement is a reflection of the prowess that MindShare has acquired within a short period of time in delivering communication strategies that are worthy of capturing the attention of the global players in the industry. Whilst SMARTIES Global is a significant achievement in its own right, the fact that it is Sri Lankas first and only win so far in this most sought-after digital awards scheme and possibly the biggest recognition for a Sri Lankan brand in the field of mobile marketing makes the award a much more outstanding achievement, said Erosha Tennakoon, General Manager, MindShare.
During both the development and execution stages of the flood relief campaign Softlogic Life provided the necessary strategic input and shared valuable insights from the 'insurance' category dynamics to enable MindShare to include the right components to the campaign in order to enhance campaign impact. The award winning Softlogic Life flood relief campaign was created around the clients corporate vision of Choose your life and it was instrumental in saving approximately 2500 lives during the disastrous floods that devastated Sri Lanka in May 2017.
Iftikar Ahmed, Managing Director, Softlogic Life Insurance said, A local brand creating such an impact on a global platform in the area of marketing and digital is a great milestone for all marketers in Sri Lanka. This shows that we as a country are well in-line with global trends and has the capability and the vision to be on par with any global brand. Without a doubt, this is the highest achievement a Sri Lankan brand has garnered in the field of marketing on a global platform.
The campaign involved setting up a simple yet highly effective SMS based platform in partnership with Etisalat, a leading mobile operator in Sri Lanka to connect flood victims, rescuers and the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) of Sri Lanka to deploy necessary rescue teams and aid to affected areas.
At a time when most communication lines were damaged and accessing the affected areas became impossible due to landslides and dangerous levels of inundation, the campaign was a success as Sri Lanka enjoys a high mobile penetration of over 110%.
Moreover, the fact that the country predominantly is a 65% feature phone market allowed a greater number of phones to be active throughout in spite of wide spread power cuts that prevailed. The SMS platform was the most opportune solution at the time since high network traffic arisen due to the disaster affected the voice call penetration.
The SMS hotline was activated with direct links to the Disaster Management Centre while an efficient dashboard gave critical information at a glance enabling the authorities to provide necessary relief. The agile SMS platform was in operation 24 hours a day. The geo targeted messages focused on affected locations were relayed as the first touch point whilst awareness building posts were posted and boosted on FB to increase reach. This campaign was much more than a strategic communication campaign that reached out to victims of a disaster in their time of need and connected whole of Sri Lanka to take action. In this context, this accolade is of particular significance to all of us at MindShare, said Chamith Buthgumwa, Head of Digital Media for Mindshare.
In a noteworthy tribute to the effectiveness and the timely relevance of the campaign, Mobile Marketing Association shortlisted the Silver award winning Softlogic Life flood relief campaign for a Smarties APAC Award as well.

Ministers to launch UKs post-Brexit economy plan
The government's plan to boost UK industry ahead of the country leaving the EU is due to be launched later.
The industrial strategy is aimed at lifting growth, which official forecasts suggest will slow due to the UK's poor productivity performance.
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK's decision to leave the EU meant the strategy was even more important.
A deal with US healthcare giant MSD to open a UK research centre has been announced as part of the strategy.
The investment by MSD, known as Merck in the US, is worth up to 1bn and is expected to create 950 jobs.
The government said the announcement was a huge vote of confidence in its plans to boost the post-Brexit UK economy.
The strategy comes just days after official forecasting body the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) announced an aggressive downgrade of its UK growth and productivity forecasts.
Political parties and business groups have said that the solution to creating stronger growth and higher wages is more investment.
The industrial strategy is expected to outline similar partnerships to the MSD one with other private sector firms in the construction, artificial intelligence and automotive sectors.
The deals will see the government pledge funding and policy collaboration in exchange for investment from private firms.

MSI: Bulker spot market set for new year fall
The dry bulk market, which posted more positive freight rates in October, is set to plummet by January 2018 with the largest drop expected to come from Capesize earnings. According to Maritime Strategies International, iron ore imports to China remain the strongest driving factor despite the downside risks amid Chinese government-enforced cuts in steel production. The most recent steel data available show a slowdown from the very high production levels of the third quarter, but there is still robust demand for tonnage for ore imports.
This has been a key tenet supporting MSIs forecast of stronger freight rates towards the end of this year and is an indication of Chinese steel manufacturers increasing preference for higher quality iron ore found in Australia and Brazil, Will Tooth, MSI Dry Bulk Analyst, said.
MSI expects that the Chinese governments focus on pollution will see even greater shifts away from the use of domestic ore with a lower iron content, due to the greater emissions produced. World Maritime News

Neo-Nazi ideologies should not return - Champika
Megapolis and Urban Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka speaking of the Avant Garde issue, said the government has failed to bring politically powerful and well-connected people to justice.
Pointing out that legal action was taken against a teacher who had taken a bribe of Rs. 25,000, Minister Ranawaka said that persons who were involved in the scandal surrounding Primary Dealer Entrust Securities, which recorded Rs. 12 billion worth fraudulent activities, were granted bail in two days. Thus, he pointed out that the government cannot get away from its responsibility of implementing justice despite ranks and positions.
Minister Ranawaka was addressing media at the ceremony held to launch the Beira Lake Intervention Area Development Plan held at JAIC Hilton, Colombo, yesterday morning.
Minister Ranawaka also said acts like celebrating Maha Wiru Samaruwa, jeopardize the reconciliation process in the country. He pointed out that the LTTE murdered innocent people who were not involved in any political movement and the responsibility of their deaths should be borne by those who celebrate terrorism. Minister Ranawaka also urged the government not to allow a return of Neo-Nazi ideologies.
Ranawaka also observed that a democratic government should not allow anybody to celebrate terrorism. He also said that if the military forces did not end the war and democracy was not established, these political leaders such as Shivagilingam will only be licking the boots of LTTE leaders such as Thamilselvan, instead of doing politics.
Minister Ranawaka also urged that the country need not lose its peace and reconciliation process for groups promoting terrorism.

New schoolbag to be introduced in 2018
A new schoolbag will be introduced next year with the intention of protecting school children from scoliosis, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, consultant doctors have already pointed out the need of introducing a new schoolbag for children with less weight. Minister Senaratne was addressing the gathering after taking part in the walk that took place in Colombo recently to educate the public on scoliosis.
Minister Senaratne said that financial assistance can be provided from the Health Development Fund to seek medical treatment from foreign countries for the children severely affected by scoliosis. The relevant surgeries required for children suffering from scoliosis will commence in Sri Lanka soon.
The extreme weight of their school bags have significantly contributed towards developing scoliosis in school children. A total of 523 children with scoliosis have been registered with the health authorities up to now, he added.

In the meantime, the Elections Commission Chairman proposed to hold the election for the 133 Local Government bodies which had not been affected by the Gazette. There were typos in the gazette in relation to 40 LG bodies and amendments need to do be done by re-issuing the gazette notification.

Pakistani Islamists call off protests after minister resigns
PAKISTAN: The Islamist leader whose group clashed violently with Pakistani security forces and paralysed Islamabad for weeks called off the sit-in protest Monday after the Law Minister resigned, meeting its key demand.
On the assurance of the Chief of Army Staff, we are calling off the sit-in, Khadim Hussain Rizvi told a crowd of around 2,500 demonstrators from the Tehreek-i-Labaik Ya Rasool Allah Pakistan (TLY), who have occupied a main highway to the capital since November 6.
His statement came after state media reported that Law Minister Zahid Hamid had resigned. There was no immediate comment or confirmation from government officials.
The decision to capitulate to the protesters demands is a major embarrassment for the embattled ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) as it eyes elections in 2018, analysts said, and underscores the influence of religious groups in the nuclear-armed nation.
The previously obscure Islamist group has been calling for weeks for Hamids ousting over a hastily-abandoned amendment to the oath which election candidates must swear.
The protesters have linked the amended wording to blasphemy -- a highly contentious issue in Muslim Pakistan that has often fuelled violence.
Mondays announcement came after a botched operation on Saturday to disperse the demonstrators sparked violence in Islamabad that left at least seven people dead and hundreds wounded. It fuelled the spread of the protests to major cities across the country including Karachi and Lahore.
The government ordered police and paramilitaries to stand down after the clashes and called on the army to intervene to restore order. By Monday morning there still had been no official response from the military.
The sit-in has enraged commuters in Islamabad and neighbouring Rawalpindi with hours-long traffic snarls, caused the death of at least one child whose ambulance could not reach hospital in time, and infuriated the judiciary. Hamids ousting is the latest in a series of heavy blows to the ruling party. - AFP

Incentive payment to address teacher shortage: Akila
The proposal to grant an incentive payment for teachers who teach subjects such as ICT, Chemistry, and Physics for which there is a severe shortage of teachers is being considered, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
He was responding to a question raised by UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday. The Minister said the Government was considering the proposal to retain those teachers in the profession.
Many teachers recruited to teach ICT, Chemistry, Physics among others, did not remain in the service for long as they do not receive a good salary, MP Gunawardena said.
The Minister agreed with the Gunawardenas comment and said the attention has already been paid to the matter. However, Increasing their salary or granting an incentive without doing the same for other teachers will lead to many issues. We hope to come up with a proper solution shortly, he said.
The Minister said the South Korean Government has agreed to train more Sri Lankan teachers in South Korea bearing all their expenses.
More teachers will be recruited for the technical subject stream and 33 digital smart classrooms are being constructed, the Minister said.
UNP denounces delaying LG elections: Eran
The UNP denounces delaying the Local Government polls; elections should be held at the right time, State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne said.
The State Minister was speaking during the committee stage debate on the financial heads of the Ministries of Disaster Management, Women and Child Affairs and Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage in Parliament yesterday.
When a new Constitution is drafted, specific dates for elections should be clearly defined, he said.
Refuting a statement made by TNA- MP Shanthi Sriskandarasa that liquor licences are issued and it helps increase alcohol consumption, Wickramaratne said the government has no such intention.
We increase all varieties of alcohol. We need to collect taxes to benefit the people. We are prepared to raise the prices of all alcohol including beer, he said.
Minister Wickramaratne said the government was ready to increase female representation in the political sphere fulfilling an election promise made to create a new Sri Lanka for women. The government has stipulated a 25 percent female representation at the upcoming LG elections, he said.
He said female engagement in the tea and rubber sectors were fairly high but in the calculation of the GDP, female contribution is not included. A mothers contribution to society, though highly significant, is not included in the GDP, he said.
Female representation in the state sector is around 50 percent, but the highest rung of management has only one female for six males. The second level management has only one female for five males. Women are ahead of males in the education sphere, but they receive far fewer opportunities in decision making process. We need to change this gap, he said. Wickramaratne said the budget has proposals to establish childcare facilities at workplaces to facilitate greater female participation in the workforce.
Samurdhi benefits for two million poor families next year
Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S.B. Dissanayake said 1.4 million of low income families would receive financial assistance and the government intended to increase the number to two million by next year.
He was speaking during the committee stage debate on the budget proposal under the financial heads of the Ministries of Women and Child Affairs, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage and Foreign Employment. The Minister said the Samurdhi fund has around 200 billion in capital. He said it would be used to save the poor people from unfair money lenders.
Villages has money lenders who prey on hapless, vulnerable villagers and give them loans at high interest. We want to release the villagers from the money lenders grasp and provide concessionary loans through banks. We intend to empower rural families through the Presidents Grama Shakthi Programme,the Minister said.
Election system has many inaccuracies, difficulties: Hakeem
The election system has many inaccuracies and difficulties that block holding early elections, City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said in Parliament yesterday.
He said it would be more advisable to revert to the earlier system if there was no way to correct the errors and anomalies of the present.
He was speaking during the committee stage debate of the budget 2018 on the financial heads of the Ministries of Disaster Management, Women and Child Affairs and Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage.
There is absolutely enough room to revert back to the earlier system, at least temporarily for the impending elections, he said.
Minister Hakeem said discussions were held with other party leaders and backbenchers, and they were all in favour of holding the elections under the earlier system.
He commended Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorale and Women and Child Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara for having moved beyond mere symbolism to improve conditions for women and for introducing several ground-breaking new changes.
The most notable change is the 25 percent female representation. It was now enacted into law. We must congratulate the Ministers, he said.
He said that only 50 percent of women are working or earning globally. Sri Lankas is at mere 35 percent. To increase female labour force, understanding the reasons for this and take steps to improve it by addressing supply and demand is vital, he said.
Court case preventing LG polls is political knot: Anura Kumara
The case before court preventing Local Government elections is a political knot, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake said in Parliament yesterday.
He was speaking during the committee stage debate on the budget proposal under the financial heads of the Ministries of Women and Child Affairs Ministry, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage and Foreign Employment.
MP Anura Dissanayake said the government formulated a election system to increase womens representation. We dont know if this would be 25 percent, MP Dissanayake said. The Parliament, however, has done a commendable job, he said.
The JVP MP said the election has to be held to increase the womens representation.
The Minister issued the gazette on November 1. The Election Commission said it would declare the elections between November 27 and December 4. While all institutions, parties and the people were getting ready for the election, the court case was filed. It was a political knot and those who instructed the former President have instructed the incumbent President as well. The same balagiri instructed the former President to interfere in the judiciary, he said.
Minister Faiszer Musthapha asked if a member could disrepute the judiciary and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said he would look into the matter.
MP Dissanayake said he was responsible for all the words he said. He said the gazette was issued on a report submitted nine months ago and the Minister was not able to identify its flaws so far.
After nine months, a member of the RDA in Bandarawela, and a person in Deniyaya, a teacher in Udawalawa, a contractor in Panduwasnuwara have at once find out flaws in the gazette, MP Dissanayake said.
How did it happen These are political cases. They dont know at least the impact of the gazette on them. Only one persons knows the flaws, he said.
Minister Faiszer Musthapha said the gazette has no flaws and the matter was being heard before a court.
He is trying to say I knew about the flaws. But the gazette has no flaws, Musthapha said.
MP Anura Dissanayake said that when the election was declared only, the court case was filed for the gazette that was issued nine months ago. This is an incident entangling the court to meet someones dishonest political end as we have seen in the history, Dissanayake said.
He said the gazette issued on August 23, 2015 has 40 flaws, and they were not related to the gazette before the court.
These flaws had to be found before November 9. But those were found after November 1, Dissanayake said.
I have sought legal advice from the Attorney Generals Department on this matter, Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
MP Dissanayake said this political trick has no parents. None has backbone to accept the error, We are ready to resolve this political matter before Parliament, Court or on the road, he said.
Living off on housemaids income shameful: Manusha
Sri Lankans should be ashamed of themselves for living off on the earnings made by women working abroad as housemaids, Foreign Employment Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said in Parliament yesterday.
He was speaking during the committee stage debate on the budget proposal under the financial heads of the Ministries of Women and Child Affairs, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage and Foreign Employment.
The country has to create jobs with higher salaries, he said.
When we celebrate our 70 years of independence, our main source of income is sending women for slavery in West Asian countries, the Deputy Minister said.
We should be ashamed of this situation as a nation disregarding party differences, the Deputy Minister said.
He said the country already lacked trained labour.
We do not have sufficient trained labour, Deputy Minister said.
We do not have to send trained labour abroad to serve them. We must develop a system to tap that potential to benefit our country. We must decide whether we should send our workers abroad while construction companies in the country are seeking government permission to bring in Indian workers to cover the dearth of workers in the industry. We should put an end to sending untrained workers abroad, the Deputy Minister said.
JO MPs listed to speak in debate absent
Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake highlighted that the JO benches were empty when important issues related to women, children, migrant workers and Samurdhi beneficiaries were discussed in the House. The absence depicts the JOs real attitude towards the peoples problems, he said.
He was speaking during the Finance Heads of the Ministries of Women and Child Affairs Ministry, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage and Foreign Employment were taken up yesterday at the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018.
Seven Joint Opposition (JO) MPs listed to speak in the debate yesterday were absent in Parliament to take the floor.
It created a gap in the debate and led to JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake chairing the House to remind the Chief Whips of the Government and the Opposition to make sure the listed MPs take part in the debate.
Kanaka Herath, Piyal Nishantha, Premalal Jayasekara, Shehan Semasinghe, Arundika Fernando, Jayantha Samaraweera, and Niroshan Premaratne were read out by the presiding member but none of them were present.
A main complaint the JO repeatedly brings out is that their group is not allocated sufficient time to speak in Parliament, but when the time was allocated, they failed to make use of it, he said.
Rules in support of differently abled do not function: Gammanpila
Strong rules pertaining to differently abled persons may suggest that our country is a haven for them. But the bitter reality is the rules are not implemented, Joint Opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila said.
Gammanpila was speaking during the committee stage debate on the budget proposal under the financial heads of the Ministries of Women and Child Affairs, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage and Foreign Employment.
Of the differently abled in the age group of 15-19 years, 30,308 receive no education. As many as 31,545 of them disabled when they were in the age group of 5-9 years; 6,404 or 20 percent of them have had no education. Just as the vicious cycle of poverty, there is vicious cycle for the disabled, he said.
Since they are disabled, they dont get education. Therefore they cannot find jobs. Joblessness hinders their independence and makes them incapable of supporting themselves. They have no other option but to suffer within this vicious cycle, he said.
A state administrative circular specifies that 3 percent of job recruitments should be allocated for differently abled persons, Gammanpila said.
Of the total number of differently abled persons in the country, 71 percent or over 1.1 million are unemployed. If they are provided with modern technical devices and training facilities, they will find employments without being a burden on their families, Gammanpila said.
Rohitha brings consumer goods to Parliament
Joint Opposition (JO) Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeygunawardena brought a chili, a sprat, and an onion into Parliament yesterday to talk of high prices of consumer goods. Exhibiting one by one, he said the prices of consumer goods were very high and the people could not afford them.
He was speaking at the committee stage debate on the budget proposals under the financial heads of the Ministries of Women and Child Affairs, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage and Foreign Employment Ministry.
A single green chili is at Rs. 8.33 today, 100 g of sprats is at Rs. 150 that means a single sprat is Rs. 2.14. One kg of onions is at Rs. 500 which means an onion bulb is Rs. 2.50, MP Abeygunawardena said.
The people ate well during our period. Those days the people talked of kilos of sprats but now they talk of single sprat. If you go to a fair, the people there will tell you the ground reality. But the government members say the people are very happy.
Over 80 percent of the people are living with difficulties. While the people live under hardships, the government attempts to postpone the LG polls, the MP said.
The government speaks of the women abroad for employments. If they do not send here their salaries for three months, economy of the country will collapse, the MP said.

Pathfinder Foundation and Heritage Foundation discuss US-Sri Lanka relations
The second round of Pathfinder Foundation teleconference with the Washington DC based Heritage Foundation for the current year was held recently.
The focus of the teleconference was aimed at discussing the current political situation in Sri Lanka, recent trends concerning human rights, ongoing discourse relating to constitutional reforms and the potential for widening economic relations between the two countries, particularly in the context of views exchanged during the recent visit by US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Thomas Shannon. A lively exchange of ideas took place especially about security and strategic developments in the Indian Ocean.
The Pathfinder Foundation and the Heritage Foundation have a history of engaging in discussions for identifying issues affecting bilateral relations. The last teleconference between the two sides was held in January this year, soon after the Presidential election in the US. Earlier, in 2014 and 2015, the two institutions carried out several rounds of discussion aimed at better understanding developments affecting bilateral relations.
On the Pathfinder side, the teleconference was attended by representatives of local blue chip companies, academics, think tanks, media personalities etc., in addition to senior personnel of the Foundation.
Jeff M. Smith, an expert on South Asia security issues, who recently assumed duties at the Asian Studies Center of the Heritage Foundation and Bernard Goonetilleke, Chairman, Pathfinder Foundation jointly, conducted the teleconference.

People can now enjoy freedom: PM
The Rajapaksa regime was responsible for tarnishing the countrys international image rather than safeguarding it in the past. Consequent to the defeat of the Rajapaksa regime on January 8, 2015, people received the opportunity to enjoy peace and freedom. But unfortunately, certain sections of the media have failed to understand that freedom and use it properly, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister made this observation, addressing a meeting of the Kolonnawa UNP Bala Mandalaya, held at Kolonnawa on November 26.
The Prime Minister said that following the January 8 victory, a good governance government was formed under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena. Subsequently, they won the Parliamentary election too. During the last two years, the government had ushered in development throughout the country. The previous government had left over an immense debt burden on the country, he said.
The government thought that it should save the country from this debt trap without allowing the future generation to inherit it, he added.
The Premier said after resolving the fundamental debt problem by 2020, it hoped to create a sound economy which could service the debts by 2050. The government had not stopped the development work by taking refuge in the countrys debt problem. If the government was able to resolve the debt problem, Sri Lankans could regain their honour and prestige once again, the Prime Minister said.
The government was trying its best to improve the education system through the Nearest school, best school, programme. It was also developing the road network in the country to facilitate investment and easier travel.
The Sedawatte road would also be developed under this programme. The government had already offered housing loans to build nearly 3,000 houses in the area. The government had taken steps to solve the garbage mountain and flood problems in the area by providing enormous relief to the people. Funds had been allocated to develop the villages and create employment avenues for youths. The fact that there is democracy in the country had been accepted by the world. The government was involved in creating a country where people of all communities could live in peace and harmony by upholding Buddhism and giving due place to other religions, the Prime Minister said. He said the government is now involved in finding solutions to conflict situations in the country.
Law and order was maintained properly. Giant development schemes had been launched throughout the country. The area from Kandy to Hambantota will have a special development scheme. The Kurunegala area was also being developed. Colombo and Gampaha would be developed as megapolis cities. Industrial zones were being launched in the Kalutara district, Galle and the surrounding regions would be developed as a tourism zone. More factories and hotels would be set up next year. The computer technology industry would also be developed. All this was being done to find jobs and empower youth, the Prime Minister said.

Plantation community empowerment project by KOICA and UN Habitat
I am both pleased and honored to be working side by side with UN Habitat in our cooperative project aimed at empowering the communities attached to Sri Lankas Plantation sector by improving their settlement and community spaces, said Lee Dong-ku, the Resident Representative for Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) at a national workshop organized by UN Habitat in collaboration with KOICA at the Kingsbury Hotel yesterday. The topic of the workshop was Empowering Communities through Settlement Improvement in the Plantation Sector.
Community empowerment is our top priority, said Lee. KOICA AND UN Habitat is currently working on a one year project focusing on Community Empowerment and Social work in the Plantation Community. They are focusing mainly on the areas of Nuwara Eliya, Kotmale and Walapane DS Divisions. The main goal of these two organizations is to empower and resilient plantation communities with satisfactory living conditions, safer settlements, better access to basic services and improved livelihood skills.
The major challenges faced by those communities connected with the upcountry and local Plantation Sector, these challenges are not only a burden to those who labor in the tea and rubber fields but these challenges are also burdened on by their families. Challenges like economic and social isolation have created an unhealthy stagnation for these communities, said M. Vamadeva in his keynote address. He is an Advisor attached to the Ministry of Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development. He also said The Plantation Community are the most undervalued community in Sri Lanka at present due to their lack of basic needs, proper education, healthcare and even a basic living space.
The most vulnerable section of this community are the women laborers. Even though they are the centre-piece of many a plantations success, they are paid lower wages and are severely under educated or un-educated, said Vamadeva pointing out the current challenges faced by the Plantation communities of Sri Lanka.
I represent the people of these communities and they are in need of desperate aid. President Maithripala Sirisena is in constant search for solutions to uplift the lives of these individuals because he values their efforts that they take to make Sri Lanka productive, however governmental officers and those attached to relevant government institutions in these communities are only interested in their commissions and hold no regard for the livelihoods of the plantation communities. The plantation communities are eternally grateful for the efforts made by UN Habitat and KOICA to better their lives. If these sacrifices werent made, these communities would still be living the depressing lives that they had to experience during colonial times when British government and private individuals held their lives on the edge of a thread, said Minister Of Hill Country New Villages, U. Palani Digambaram on the topic of the challenges faced by the Plantation communities.
Several themes pertaining to the local plantation sector were also discussed at the event through expert panel discussions. The discussions included settlement planning, infrastructure and housing; governance and legal aspects.
The conference also bought together national experts on the plantation sector, housing and infrastructure development, plantations as well as policy makers, government officials, donors and regional plantation companies.

Political resources for reconciliation
The District Inter Religious Committees of Sri Lanka gathered in Colombo recently and exchanged their experiences of interreligious cooperation and collaboration in aspects of reconciliation among the variety of people living side by side in all the parts of Sri Lanka.
The undue intrusion of corrupt politics into the lives of people have so adversely influenced the lives of all our people who left to themselves would have adjusted their lives to live cordially together as decent fellow human beings.
For all the plastering and patching up between the two parties of the coalition government and the reality of an atmosphere free from fear of arbitrary arrests, threats, white vans and grease devils of the despicable political culture of the Rajapaksa era, there does not appear to the people a solid and united front of the government embarking on and vigorously pursuing a culture of genuine reconciliation based on equality of human dignity, rights, freedoms and equality of all the citizens belonging to the various ethnic, religious and cultural groups in Sri Lanka.
This is still strongly felt by the minorities in Sri Lanka in spite of the praiseworthy actions of the Minister and the National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Ministry to unite all people living in the island under the Sri Lankan identity because all the ministers do not have the right attitude and do not pull together with the intention of binding the various communities of people as Sri Lankans. Because they are politically divided, they bring to bear their partisan and personal political attitudes on matters of national policy. Whether their breadth of vision is narrowed by their political outlook, opportunism, prejudice, racial or family background needs to be examined.
Due to a lack of clarity on national policy, each minister as well as each MP, Provincial Counsellor and Local Government Representative seems to show forth a different attitude towards human dignity, equality, non-discrimination, impartiality as their fancy takes them. Not only do many of them show a glaring lack of intellectual, moral, psychological and emotional maturity, they show forth and display their racial and religious prejudices in a manner that affect also the public servants working under them who become reluctant to cooperate and collaborate in affairs that devolve to the common good.
STOOPING LOW
There was a time when Sinhala Buddhists, Tamil Hindus, Muslims, Burghers and Malays, Sinhala and Tamil Catholics students studied together in the same grade and school. Though they knew each ones ethnic and religious background and identity, it did not stand in the way of their feeling and acting as classmates and schoolmates. We were so much bonded together that we even called ourselves clash mates when we competed and clashed with others in various sports. There was great camaraderie and friendship, the give and take and mutual sharing that overcame the petty quarrels we had now and then. Those quarrels were very temporary affairs; they never dragged on for years and years so much so that because of our solid friendship we do not even remember what we quarrelled over just as we do not remember what we quarrelled over as brothers and sisters in the bosom of our families.
Why do we become so petty and carping, untruthful and antagonistic, deceitful and vicious in politics and public life while showing a faade of religiosity by artfully planned visits to places of worship and making token offerings which indeed become rotten offerings due to the cunning, hypocrisy and meanness hidden in the heart hidden beneath an immaculate dress but very apparent to the onlooker who has been observant over a period of time of the public behaviour of politicians and their henchmen contrasting with their private conduct in the domestic environment
From the politician, public bureaucrat, education administrator, school principal and teacher to the three-wheeler driver, all wish to appear as benevolent, gracious providers of service to all and sundry while they actually practice blackmail, extortion and deception not only on the gullible but also on the helpless. Why do we stoop so low to outwit one another Is that what the family background about which so many are very proud, religious upbringing and educational training, obtained free, have brought us to
MISCONCEIVING RECONCILIATION
Then there are some who plan to come to power by becoming political thugs. They openly threaten the peace-loving people. They disturb the social peace and reconciliation by their threatening words that activate provocative social behaviour and instigate criminal action. They should be arraigned before the law. The majority of the people and the government should not become helpless onlookers before these uncouth, hateful and coarse characters who exhibit their propensity to thuggery for political ends.
Reconciliation is not about compromising on the democratic values and the rule of law and the equality of all the citizens that should be always upheld in Sri Lanka without conceding to some people the privilege of being above the law.
If politicians or those intending to become politicians do not understand the concept of reconciliation as a noble way of life among decent human beings and something in every way profitable to Sri Lanka, their heads need to be examined.
Social stability and peace are absolutely necessary for social progress and economic development. The New Constitution should be so framed as to gain the confidence and support of the great majority of the people along with the definitive solution of National Question. A political climate would be so created where every citizen is equal to every other before the law, no person or section of the people are marginalized or made to feel subservient to any other person or section due to their money bags, funds in foreign banks, various connections political or otherwise.
RECOUPING SRI LANKAS GOOD NAME
The good name of Sri Lanka that has been besmirched by the chauvinists and anarchists who are greedy over what rightly belongs to others. People in foreign lands think of the majority community in Sri Lanka as a selfish people who do not know how to share and live in a civilized manner and are incapable of getting along and living with others in solidarity and in amity.
It has fallen to the present generation living in the North and South, East and West of Sri Lanka to usher a new political culture and redeem her good name as befitting those who live in the Pearl of the Indian Ocean.

Politics of ex. President over; he has no political future - Minister Duminda Dissanayake
We the UNP and the SLFP jointly have been reigning the country showing for the first time an exemplary political vision sans political discrimination, hatred, nepotism and vengeance.
This political trend is being commended and lauded internationally. Only the former President Mahinda Rakapaksha and his clan are opposing and objecting this good governance administration in desperation, emphasized Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake. He said these at a public meeting held at Galnewa recently for appraising the party supporters of the present political situation.
The minister said further that the forthcoming local government elections were not meant for selecting a president.
"Presidential elections were over and at the particular polls former president lost power and has fallen to the level of just a Member of the Parliament. Now the executive powers are vested on President Maithripala Sirisena who risked his life and political future by becoming the common presidential candidate during a period where there was no law and order neither democracy. So the voters shall choose a person representing the Executive President and the present government for the overall development of the village", the Minister said.
He said that it would be worthless and wasting the precious vote of a candidate representing Mahinda Rajapaksha if he has been voted in to power. Such a person would remain inactive and politically idling just having confined to salary allowances and various privileges, Dissanayake reiterated.
"We worked hard for the party when Chandrika Bandaranayake and Mahinda Rajapaksha were in power. Now our leader is Maithripala Sirisena and we are duty bound and obliged ethically expected to support him, protect him and follow him. The present chaotic situation in SLFP began due to the cheap politics of the former President who deprived the political future as a amateur politician by contesting again to enter the Parliament contrary to the internationally accepted political norms and criteria. Now he is barred from becoming the President or the Prime Minister. These are highly foolish, narrow minded and short sighted ways to go after Mihinda Rajapaksha and his group as such an act would help to break SLFP into fragments. Such a traitorous deed dividing the party would usher us in to sure defeat at elections as it is more important and vital to vote for SLFP to gain local government elections victory rather than wasting the franchise on ''Pohottuwa'' (flower bud) which will never politically blossom", the minister further said.
He said that the new party called 'Pohottuwa' emerged purely on the basis of soliciting political vengeance paving way for perishing the SLFP. He appealed to the public to give power to the pure SLFP to establish a powerful single government to enable to gather all democracy loving political parties under one shelter.

President clears the air
President Maithripala Sirisena has cleared the air regarding his relationship with the UNP. Meeting with a group of civil society activists, at his official residence, the President made it clear, in no uncertain terms, that on no account would he jettison his association with the UNP. This is amidst rumours of a possible rapprochement between the two warring factions of the SLFP and Joint Opposition, after the Presidents recent outburst targeting a certain UNP member who faulted him for appointing the Bond Commission. It also comes in the wake of an alleged spat between the President and the PM that were circulating on social media.
While acknowledging that talks between the SLFP and the Mahinda Rajapaksa faction were being held, the President was insistent that this would in no way be at the expense of the UNP. Denying that he had asked Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to step down, the President went onto criticize certain media whom he faulted for spreading blatant lies, according to the leading news item in an English daily, carried yesterday.
He pledged to continue with the Yahapalanaya government and promised to appoint Presidential Commissions on the lines of the Bond Commission to probe state enterprises such as SriLankan airlines. The President also said that the public were not happy with the delay to punish those involved in major corruption, even after three years since the election of the new government.
The Presidents decision to come out in the open and clear all uncertainties in the matter involving his alliance partner, should be appreciated. For one thing, any signs of destability in the government is certainly going to send the wrong message to foreign investors. Besides denting investor confidence, it can also have repercussions on the local financial markets. The Government can ill afford such a scenario at the present juncture.
Above all, the Unity Government concept was a unique feature in the countrys post independence political landscape, where, for the first time, the arch political foes have joined together in a combined effort to serve the country. President Sirisena, certainly, cannot be seen to be giving the karapincha treatment to the UNP which was the vehicle through which he ascended the throne.
True, there are bound to be differences, as with any coalition, and, styles of governance. This is natural, considering the different ideologies of the main protagonists.
It is also difficult to conceive of an alliance between President Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa ever bearing fruition, whatever efforts made by their respective interlocutors to bring the parties together. True, there are no permanent friends, or, enemies in politics. But the rivalry between the duo, without doubt, runs very deep. It is difficult to foresee President Sirisena entering into a political marriage with an individual who he (President) said would have sent him six feet below terra firma, had the results been different, on January 8.
It is also difficult to see Rajapaksa playing second fiddle to the President, under any possible alliance, and, this reality could not to be lost on President Sirisena. MR, certainly, would bide his time to get even with his onetime Senior Cabinet Minister and Party General Secretary, who decamped to consort with the enemy. An alliance, if any, at best, would be an uneasy one and unworkable on the long run.
Besides, President Sirisena cannot peremptorily betray the trust reposed in him by civil society groups whose raison detre for selecting the Common Candidate was to rid the country of Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family rule, not to mention the great sacrifices made by the late Ven. Sobitha Thera. They all put their shoulder to the wheel on behalf of President Sirisena to usher in good governance which was alien to Rajapaksa and the main reason why they clamoured for his ouster.
President Sirisena cannot also ignore the UNP voter, who carried him to victory. To say that any alliance with Mahinda Rajapaksa would be a slap in the face of the UNPers would indeed be an understatement. The President cannot be unaware that it was the Greens who conducted his election campaign, at tremendous risk. He cannot be seen to be turning his back on this segment of the voters by now linking up with Mahinda Rajapaksa, and, his caboodle, who, only heaped insults and calumny on the Common Candidate.
The mountain of accusations, and, serious ones at that, made against the Rajapaksa family, by the Common Candidate would also show the President in poor light, before the public, if ever he decides to tie up with Rajapaksa, and, the President cannot be blind to this reality. More so, it would be a betrayal of all those who are eagerly waiting to see wrongdoers of the former regime punished. Hence, the President would not want to place himself in an awkward position, where his credibility would suffer.
Considering all the foregoing, there is no reason to doubt the Presidents word that he would continue with the Unity Government, casting aside the demand by the Joint Opposition to sack the UNP from the government, as a condition for a rapprochement.

Progress in LDCs hinges on access to modern energy
According to The Least Developed Countries Report 2017, published Tuesday, the worlds 47 least developed countries (LDCs) are falling far behind the rest of the developing world in terms of getting power to homes and businesses.
While they have made great strides in recent years, achieving the global goal of universal access to energy by 2030 will require a 350 per cent increase in their annual rate of electrification.
Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 is not only a question of satisfying households basic energy needs, UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said in Geneva, ahead of the reports publication on Tuesday. That in itself has valuable welfare implications, but we need to go beyond For electrification to transform LDC economies, modern energy provision needs to spur productivity increases and unlock the production of more goods and services.
Dr. Kituyi added: The productive use of energy is what turns access into economic development, and what ensures that investments in electricity infrastructure are economically viable. But that means looking beyond satisfying households basic needs to achieving transformational energy access  satisfying producers needs for adequate, reliable and affordable energy.
While on average 10 per cent of people in other developing countries lack access to electricity, this remains the case for more than 60 per cent of the population in LDCs. And LDCs as a group have around just 8 per cent the capacity of other developing economies to generate electricity per person, and barely 2 per cent that of wealthier nations.
This two-way relationship between the productive use of energy and economic development, which the report dubs the energy-transformation nexus, remains very weak in LDCs. More than 40 per cent of businesses operating in these countries are held back by inadequate, unreliable and unaffordable electricity. On average, they suffer 10 power outages per month, each lasting around five hours, and this costs them 7 per cent of the value of their sales.Achieving universal access to modern energy in LDCs by 2030 will be costly. Based on previous global estimates, the report puts the cost at US$12 billion to US$40 billion per year. Transformational energy access would cost still more.
This far exceeds the resources currently available, the report says. Total official development assistance to the energy sector is just US$3 billion per year, domestic resources for public investment are scarce in most LDCs, and most also face serious limits to borrowing without risking an unsustainable debt burden.
Private investors show little enthusiasm for investments in electricity infrastructure in LDCs, which entail large irreversible costs, long project cycles and slow payback. Most LDCs are also seen as relatively high-risk environments  although the availability of de-risking instruments, such as insurance and guarantee products, might help to bolster confidence.
Governments could raise extra capital by developing domestic debt markets or tapping into alternative sources of funding, such as impact investors, infrastructure funds and, in some LDCs, the population living abroad. Better still, the report says, would be for international donors to honour their long-standing commitment to provide at least 0.150.20 per cent of their national income in aid, as part of the Istanbul Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 20112020 of the United Nations. Current aid levels to LDCs fall short of this target by US$33 billion to US$50 billion per year.Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, could have a revolutionary effect in rural areas, home to 82 per cent of those without power in LDCs, and help to overcome the historical obstacles to rural electrification.
But non-hydro renewable energy in these countries has so far come mostly from small-scale technologies, such as solar lanterns and stand-alone home systems. While these have brought some progress, they fall short of the game-changing access to power that LDCs need to transform their economies.
Utility-scale renewable technologies capable of feeding the grids and mini-grids necessary not only to power homes, but also to grow businesses and industries, need to be deployed rapidly. (UNCTAD)

Record-breaker Ashwin eyeing 600 Test wickets
Nagpur: Indian spin king Ravichandran Ashwin said Monday he wanted to double his tally of 300 Test wickets after becoming the fastest bowler to the mark against Sri Lanka. Ashwin surpassed Australias pace legend Dennis Lillee, achieving the milestone in his 54th Test. Lillee took 56 matches to reach the same mark.
I really hope I can go on to double these 300 wickets. Ive only played 50 Tests, said the 31-year-old off-spinner after India crushed Sri Lanka by an innings and 238 runs on the fourth day of the second Test in Nagpur.
Its not easy bowling spin, it looks like youre just ambling up. But theres a lot (that goes) behind it.
The mercurial spinner, ranked fourth among top the top 10 bowlers, dismissed number eleven batsman Lahiru Gamage for nought to return impressive match figures of 8-130.
Ashwin, who made his debut against the West Indies in 2011, is Indias premier spin bowler and has often achieved top positions in the International Cricket Council rankings.
He had also surpassed Lillee in the race to 250 wickets in his 45th Test against Bangladesh early this year.
Ashwin also has 150 one-day wickets in 111 matches and 52 wickets in 46 Twenty20 games. AFP

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday warned the UNP Parliamentary Group to refrain from criticizing President Maithripala Sirisena.
The UNP Parliamentarians were specifically informed not make any statement in public which would harm the consensus of the unity government.
Addressing the UNP Parliamentary Group at the Parliamentary complex, the Premier made a special focus on a number of press conferences held by UNP Parliamentarians while he was on an official visit to India. He informed all Parliamentarians of the party not to hold any press conference without his consent in the future.
The Prime Minister has also kept the Parliamentarians informed about his meeting with the President after his return to the country. The Prime Minister has told UNP Parliamentarians that the President has apprised him that he is not in a position to prevent the SLFP from having discussions with the Joint Opposition and if he blocked such discussions, he would face criticism as a leader responsible for creating divisions in the party. It was also stressed at the UNP group meeting to strive for the victory at the future election without making the discussions between SLFP and Joint Opposition a issue.
Addressing a public meeting at Nikaweratiya in the Kurunegala district last Friday, President Maithripala Sirisena underscored the need for unity within his coalition government.
Addressing his critics, the President in an emotional address made it clear that he was prepared to put his job on the line in the interest of ensuring Good Governance and tackling corruption and fraud. If there is undue criticism and complaints against the decisions taken by me to stop corruption and fraud, I am ready to leave all positions and join the people to continue the struggle, he said.

Rock on!
The band Rock this Country have been creating ripples and making waves in the music industry. And the predominant reason for this is because they are natural. They are in their natural milieu. We can learn a lot from this group of people. They enjoy their music because music is what is natural to them and they are doing what comes naturally to them.
They are not in the business to make money or they are not in the business for the sake of competition. Melodies speaks to front man of Rock This Country Viraj Perera who affirmed that you last longer in an industry when it comes naturally to you.

Rock this country was founded by two people, Terry Bertus and myself. We had this liking for country music and country rock music. So we thought lets do something together. Terry is known for her good vocals and we started looking for musicians. This was during the timeline of early 2016. That was when we started looking for musicians, said Perera.
Love is what drives them. Love for doing what they want to do. No pressure or stress. Just doing it for the sake of loving it.
We are successful because we do what we are passionate about. More than trying to compete we try to be creative. There is this sense of freedom we get from doing things for the sake of being creative. A lot of things work for you, when you do what you do out of passion, rather than when you just try and compete.
I like working that way. We try to be creative and we are not driven by making money or be trying to rule the industry. Because a lot of things have worked together for the reasons I mentioned above, we have come to where we are today, explained Perera.
The target is now to release three of their originals by 2018. The songs are still being written. Some of the songs are blues oriented. Ashan, the extremely talented lead guitarist along with the two main vocalists Terry and Dexter are working on some of the lyrics.
Right now we are only doing cover music, but along with the cover music we do a lot of improvisations. We dont just stick to the record itself, we experiment with stuff. We are being creative with what we already have. But at the moment we only do cover music, said Perera.
When it comes to cover versions they do a lot of Eagles. Terry loves doing Patsy Cline and LeAnn Rimes and Dolly Parton. Dexter is very good at Kenny Rogers and Lionel Richie.
I try my best to be organized. We have a lot of good structures behind a performance. Beforehand we try to finalize all the details. All the important details are handled beforehand. We do not walk into a performance unprepared. The dressing room, the food, the travel itinerary and the size of the stage and the preferred songs are all taken into account. The technicalities are addressed beforehand, and it is very rare that we face a crisis at a wedding. Because those things can take away your focus from the performance. If a problem comes up, we try to solve it as a team. We do our homework for the performance, pointed out Perera.
Perera himself is inspired Dire Straits and the Eagles. He confesses to like John Mayer. He likes Country connected to Blues. He is also interested in Eric Clapton. These types of music inspire him to write the lyrics he likes.
As for Terry and Dexter, the artistes they like are inspiring them. Dexter would write something similar to what Kenny Rogers would sound like or Lionel Richie would sound like. Terry would do what she loves  Dixie Chicks, Dolly Parton or LeAnn Rimes. Terry is also a good rocker and she likes rock. She is a soulful singer, added Perera.
Perera himself likes Creedence Clearwater Revival and loads of others artistes. Locally he loves the bands Wildfire, Anno Domini, Flame and Misty.
Playing with all of the performers I have had to perform with has been a huge privilege and most of them are like legends. Rock this Country is performing New Years Eve at Melbourne this year. So we are really looking forward to it, said Perera.
Perera admits that music has very much been a part of his life. It is not something you can run away from he says. It is a calling. It is destiny. It has been an integral part of his life  playing with bands and different musicians.
Next to God, music is the closest, and I have never lived without it. Definitely this gift of music is from God. It is in my blood. You can learn music but I have with me a group of musicians who have been born with this gift, and they have developed that gift they have already got. It is lovely doing music together with those people. It is a real pleasure, added Perera.
He summed up by saying that his dream is to write songs and release some music that is their own. That will be popular and people will love it.
The bands powerhouse front liners Terry Bertus and Dexter Batcho and the amazing bunch of musicians behind them namely, Viraj Perera (Piano / Vocals) Ashan De Silva (Guitars), William Jay (Bass) and Ruwan Perera (Drums) do cater to the toe tappers as well as the hard core dancers. When required, the band is also ready to fill the floor with those inevitable Sri Lankan Bailas.

SLSSA launches new website
Sri Lanka Ship Suppliers Association (SLSSA) launched a new website to promote their activities after their annual general meeting last Friday.
'We stand at a crucial point in time for our Industry in a situation where Sri Lanka is gradually moving towards realizing its potential as a Maritime Hub, this brings with it many opportunities as well as unique challenges', said the President elect, Oshan Fernando.
To exploit these opportunities, I firmly believe we need to keep evolving as Ship Suppliers in facing the challenges we face in the local and global landscape and together as members of the Ship Supply Association, we should aim to utilize our combined strength, knowledge and vision to our advantage.
During the year ahead, we hope to explore several areas in assisting our members in facing the international challenges, he said.
In strengthening our own capabilities, the Association will aim to explore how we can better utilize our combined strengths, primarily in infrastructure, storage and logistics toward the betterment of all our members where we can maximize underutilized resources.
Further, we aim to equip our members towards competing at an international level with rival supply hubs in the region and internationally. We aim to accomplish this through a programme involving facilitating our members participation in International conferences informing our members of the benefits of our association with SLSSA and its network of 2,000 Ship suppliers and links with multiple important representatives in the Global Maritime sphere and promoting international quality standards to our members.
I would like to take a moment to expand on one aspect in particular: our commitment to international quality standards, we firmly believe it is of paramount importance that our Members adopt international Quality Standards which have become mandatory in competing internationally.
To this end, the SLSSA aims to provide awareness of the benefits of these standards, guidance toward obtaining the certifications, and obtaining concessionary rates from Standards Awarding Bodies for SLSSA members. (SS)

Sri Lankan cricket needs the gumption of Yorkshire
Fortunes fluctuated drastically for the Sri Lankans in the recent Test match against India which was played on the 15th of November 2017 in Calcutta. They saved the match by the skin of their teeth. True it was a gripping match till the weather gods intervened, but the truth of the matter was Virat Kohli and his band of marauders nearly decapitated our feeble batting line up.
I was an avid follower of not only Test cricket but county cricket as well throughout the seventies in England. Then Yorkshire the county situated in the north of England stood head and shoulders above the rest when it came to guts.
J.M. Kilburns book Over throws gives a vivid description of this countys gumption. He stated that Yorkshire cricket is accorded by the cricketing world in general a quality of its own. The reputation, being of practical benefit is welcomed by Yorkshiremen who have come to guard and emphasized it, even to an extent of accepting some of the less desirable by-products. Yorkshire cricket was supposed to be played the hard way, with competitive success a primary concern. It was seen as determined batting and painstaking bowling; as cricket of serious mien and an unsympathetic, not to say contemptuous, view of failure and misfortune. In short, the message is They dont play cricket for fun stated Kilburn. Yorkshiremen do not find their cricket fun in a purposeless past time, in idle occupation with hit or miss experiment in involving no consequence. They do find fun in the struggles of cricket, the endeavour towards successful batting and bowling techniques, the outwitting of opponents, the satisfaction of ability displayed and potential realised. The worst failing a Yorkshire cricketer can, show to Yorkshiremen is the slap-happy, thoughtless attitude. The fun of the game comes from solving its problems, from treating it with respect as a worthwhile undertaking and of course from winning.
The Indian cricket set up should learn something from the following:
By repute Yorkshire cricket lays too much emphasis on winning. The Yorkshire retort would be Are both sides not trying to win then Was the contest arranged on an intention to determine who would win There is right and wrong in both arguments. No team, no individual, can lay too much emphasis on winning as a desirable and fundamental objective, provided endeavour remains within the legal and moral framework of play. Teams and individuals would be uncomplimentary to opponents, to spectators and to self-responsibility were they compete without trying to win. The Olympics claim that its more important to take part than to win needs extension; the greater importance is to take part in an endeavour to win by acceptable means.
Virat Kohli and his coterie were jumping like jack rabbits after each and every ball not to get the Lankan batsmen by legal means but to prise out the umpires forefinger from the safety of his pocket, at times the demands were so great that the umpires finger came out of his pocket so fast that he could have beaten the fastest draw in Texas, all this drama was only to be nullified by the DSR much to the chagrin of the Indian players, some of them would have been better off with a couple of valiums to calm their nerves.
Kilburn also emphasised the fact that in Yorkshire philosophy of sport;
It is impossible to be too keen on winning a competitive engagement.
The desire to win is unalloyed.
Some practises arising from the virtue can tarnish it - cheating is an obvious example.
Manipulation of the rules and customs to an opponents disadvantage Instigation and cultivation of a disagreeable atmosphere (the Aussies are past masters, but the Indians are on their heels watch out!)
Most of us I suspect have stepped into the grey area at some time or other in our sporting behaviour; have sought an advantage by unwarrantable appeal, by wasting time (Mohamed Sami vs Niroshan Dickwella) this is a practice honed if not sharp. In the ultimate assessment Kilburn stated that all should seek mercy rather than justice.
The Yorkshire reputation for playing hard cricket was not acceptable to them as an accusation of approving the grey area. W.G. Grace was not a Yorkshireman, but he had his little ways, D.R. Jardine was not a Yorkshireman, nor was bodyline bowling a Yorkshire conception.It was not a Yorkshire bowler who shouldered a running batsman to the ground in a Lords Test match. Yorkshire cricket has received public rebuke for misconduct on the field and in the dressing room, but Yorkshire cricket authority has invariably acknowledged error and sought correction recalled Kilburn.
During the recent 1st Test match played against India at Calcutta, the Lankans kept the Indians on the ropes for much of the time, and if it was a boxing match we would have won on points.
Although we were floored by that man Virat Kohli and then struggled against the ropes with the impacts of vicious left hooks and upper cuts delivered by Kumar and Sami our cricketers staggered into the dressing room with wounds and cuts and half swollen eyes, although the eyes were swollen they were not completely shut and that is why they could see through the gloom and save the match for Sri Lanka.
I felt that the atmosphere, the crowds and the antics of the Indian fielders, Kohli in particular, could have put both Sharuk and Salman Khan in the shade, with his antics.
Not to worry Virat there is another glittering career that awaits you once you leave the sacred turf and for the opposing bowlers sake, it should be sooner than later. What a glorious innings the only hitch so to say was, there was not enough icing put on the cake. Well done mate being an Asian, I am proud of you.

## Title: The STEM phenomenon
## Supertitle:

The STEM phenomenon
The diminishing interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) subjects seems to have become a major concern in the education system in Sri Lanka. At present, the Sri Lankan graduate enrolments, especially in science faculties, have declined. We are offering the same subjects throughout the years when the world is ahead of us.
Same thing happened in the United States about 20 years ago, but it has now turned around. The reason for the increase of interest in the STEM in the United States is twofold. First, in the US there was a big tech boom in the 1990s, and a lot of people, instead of going to science, went into computer science, start-up companies, finance or economics. But with the economic ups and downs, and especially the recession 10 years ago, its not so attractive anymore. The other thing is that everyone got very worried  just as we sense it is happening here in Southeast Asia  that people arent going into engineering and science anymore.
The STEM word itself came from the effort in the United States to improve science, technology, engineering and math. There was this big effort, which came from the government and the NSF (National Science Foundation)  STEM, STEM, STEM!  trying to inform students about the opportunities, the excitement, and increase outreach activities. And the amazing thing is that it has worked! Its working, and you can see it in the numbers.
We heard this concern in Malaysia and Singapore. The same thing happened to Europe, too! They were also worried 10 years ago, and they too are making a lot of effort and these efforts actually worked. Therefore, this attention to opportunities in science, engineering and math is having an effect.
The economic conditions, especially in developing countries, often go through a period where suddenly there are opportunities. Before real development happens in a place, an ambitious kid often has ambitious parents who want the kid to become a medical doctor. Engineer Not so much. Scientist What is a scientist How can you make a living As things begin to improve, people think about making money in finance and economics. We need to teach the parents as much as the students, and the teachers, what opportunities exist in an advanced economy and a growing economy in the modern world!
We need to change the mindset of parents, teachers and students  tell them what opportunities are available and how exciting science is.
In the US, Singapore, Malaysia, China various groups, definitely the NSF, have been trying in many ways to promote STEM education, by outreach, and by things that we do with lectures and the science camps. There are various ways to do this, but we need to change the mindset of parents, teachers and students in Sri Lanka to make aware on opportunities available in the field of science and how exciting science is. Sri Lanka spends much on research grants and teacher development. However, the outcome of research has shown less impact to the country. Student-orientation activities in education and higher education in science has declined throughout the years.
Sri Lankas contribution
Sri Lanka is a small country, a country of a small population. However, the brain drain happening from students to high-end researchers have not addressed in any forum in Sri Lanka. Therefore, its hard to have super excellence in all fields. Our people are involved in developing other countries around the world with well-motivated researchers and ideas. Where have we gone wrong in Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka could make significant contributions in STEM development in the years to come, and it partly depends on people  we need the right people.
Denmark, 100 years ago, was a small Northern European country, with some good science and universities. And then Niels Bohr came along  one person. He invented the Bohr atom, dominated quantum physics and constructed the first institute that brought people together, creating an enormous social impact on how science is done by creating the Niels Bohr Institute. In 1922, Niels Bohr received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and the radiation emanating from them.
The Niels Bohr Institute is a research institute of the University of Copenhagen. The research of the institute spans astronomy, geophysics, nanotechnology, particle physics, quantum mechanics and biophysics. That is an example where it depended on one person who was really special and on a society which supported him.
The Carlsberg Foundation funded this new institute, the government was very supportive and they created this incredible intellectual centre in physics, which was so important in a little country. That can happen to Sri Lanka if academia and the laymen think positively on new opportunities prevailing in the world around to share with the next generation of children. Therefore, investment in STEM education is very important for a country like Sri Lanka.
Way forward - STEM education for Sri Lanka
We need to harness the potential and true spirit and the creativity lies in our students and academia. There is a necessity of conducting science camps, inviting experts in other countries to share their thinking with our academia and students. We need to exploit opportunities in science for our next generations to come especially in upgrading the curriculums and introducing new subjects in STEM education. Private and public sector partnerships are essential in promoting and exploiting new avenues in STEM education for Sri Lanka. Further, we need proper monitoring and evaluation of funding for development of STEM education in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has an excellent institutional arrangement in development of Science where the outcome does not have a significant impact on the development of STEM education.
Though it is a challenge, Sri Lanka needs to have a focus on excellence, and need to exploit that and create something truly world-class and exceptional.

Stolen diaries found in Berlin
Theyre among over 100 items belonging to The Beatles icon to be recovered John Lennons diaries have been found in Berlin  and are among over a hundred stolen items belonging to the Beatles musician to be recovered by police.
Lennons diaries are currently on display at Berlin police headquarters  along with two pairs of his iconic round specs, a tape recording of a Beatles concert, sheet music and a cigarette case. The collection of items were stolen from Lennons widow Yoko Ono back in 2006.
According to the BBC, German media have reported that Ono has identified the goods from photos she was shown at the German consulate in New York.
Many of the items were confiscated in July after being found at an auction house in the German capital, which prompted police to hunt for the remaining stolen goods.
Police said that a 58-year-old man has been arrested, while a second suspect  who used to work for Ono  is currently unattainable, according to Martin Steltner, a spokesman for the Berlin prosecutors office.
Back in October, a collection of previously-unseen John Lennon photographs were unveiled at The Beatles Story museum in Liverpool.
26 negatives, dating back to 1970, were revealed at a memorabilia day at The Beatles Story Museum in the bands hometown.
The 1992 letter, written to Chapmans pen pal Michael, contained Chapmans claim that Jesus is a real, living person I have come to know.
Jesus is everything, he wrote. I have found this through the many long years here at Attica [the New York state jail where he was imprisoned until 2012].
He chose to die so that our sins  even mine  could be forgiven. Twelve years ago I shot and killed the rock superstar John Lennon, formerly of The Beatles. Let me say here that it was a horrible occurrence, I have never forgotten it. NME

Theatre treat for children and youth
Somalatha Subasinghe Play House presents its annual theatre festival for young audiences from December 8 to 10 at Lionel Wendt Theatre at 3.30 p.m. and 6.45 p.m.
The festival will feature the following three plays produced by Somalatha Subasinghe Play House: Walas Pawula (Goldilocks and the Three Bears) directed by Chandana Aluthge.
Ratmalee (Red Riding Hood) and Punchi Apata Dan Therei (We Know It Now) written and directed by Somalatha Subasinghe. All these plays are semi-musical type. The production style of the plays has been developed so as to give the audiences an aesthetic journey of entertainment.
Walas Pawula (Goldilocks and the Three Bears)
Walas Pawula is based on the fairy tale Goldilocks and the Three Bears by Joseph Cunball. This semi - musical paves a great opportunity for the children of this generation to break from the routine entertainment through screens and be part of a charming magical world which unfolds before them. The play is produced with the objective of making a positive influence to children by celebrating values and concepts such as love, kindness, appreciation of nature and self-expression. The play could also act as a mirror and a compass for parents to evaluate and guide their own relationships with their children to a positive direction.
Punchi Apata Dan Therei (We KnowIt Now) and Ratmalee
Punchi Apata Den Therei (We Know it Now) and Ratmalee are based on famous international Falk tales and fairy tales. They are semi musicals produced with the objective to instil in children, a sense of basic art forms and a pride in our own culture as well as to promote the importance of the institution of family and its values. In addition, the lessons of love, humanity and world awareness are refreshingly presented in these plays. In the adaptations, new characters and situations have been incorporated particularly to facilitate an intellectual and entertaining discourse with the Sri Lankan child.
Punchi Apata Dan Therei is a prescribed text for Drama and Theatre for Grade 6 and Sinhala language for Grade 9 (National syllabus).

This year, they will be giving away three prime plots of land and other prizes worth Rs.1 million to shoppers purchasing any three nominated brands during the months of October and November.

Consumer promotions such as the widely popular Idam Nidanaya promo that we had developed together with Unilever Sri Lanka in 2016 play a significant role in helping us realize this goal. With valuable plots of land and several other prizes on offer, it had helped us win over the hearts and minds of consumers around the island last year.

We are honored to partner with Lanka Sathosa, the nations largest state-owned retail network, on the Idam Nidanaya campaign for the second consecutive year.

Warner, Bancroft pile on Gabba misery for England
Brisbane: A record-breaking opening partnership between David Warner and Cameron Bancroft cemented a crushing 10-wicket victory for Australia Monday, leaving England with pressing issues to resolve to salvage the Ashes series.
Warner and newcomer Bancroft got the required runs in a 173-run opening stand to smash an 87-year-old record for the all-time highest unbeaten opening partnership in a successful Test chase.
Warner finished unbeaten on 87 off 119 balls with Bancroft hitting the winning boundary to remain 82 not out from 182 deliveries.
It was the seventh time Australia had vanquished England by 10 wickets in the Ashes and leaves the home side unbeaten at their Gabba fortress in 29 years.
"The first Test of an Ashes is very important, there was a bit of pressure but I'm really pleased with how we played," Australian skipper Steve Smith said.
"The way we pulled it back to win from the position we were in, it's extremely pleasing. I'm proud of the way the boys fought."
The Australians only needed 56 runs on the final morning go one up after England imploded on Sunday's fourth day, leaving captain Joe Root with issues to resolve ahead of Saturday's first-ever Ashes day-night second Test in Adelaide.
"I think the most important thing is we stay strong and tight as a group of players and that we continue to keep doing the hard work that we have done throughout the whole trip," Root said.
"For three days, we played some excellent cricket. Unfortunately, when we got into good positions, we didn't quite capitalise on it."
Much of the post-match reaction centred on Bancroft allegedly being headbutted by England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow in a late-night altercation in Perth last month, which only came to light on Sunday.
Both parties worked to play it down Monday with Bancroft saying it was a "weird" and "random" greeting instead of a traditional hand-shake, while Bairstow said there was nothing malicious about it and "no animosity" between the pair.
It was Warner's 25th Test fifty and ninth in the Ashes, while Bancroft posted his first half-century in only his second Test innings.
"Great to get a win with the guys. I know everyone's really excited and hopefully we can carry this momentum forward," Bancroft said. Warner said it was heartening to get the win without losing a wicket.
"That's what we cherish, coming out being disciplined to try and get the job done as best as possible," he said.
England's doleful defeat was played to the background sounds of the travelling Barmy Army supporters singing 'We'll Take the (Ashes) Urn Home' in the sparsely-populated ground.
It was an attritional battle between the traditional rivals over the first three days of the Test, raising England's hopes of a first win at the Gabba in just over three decades. AFP

World Bank report urges mitigation of risks, hunt for opportunities
Sri Lanka is on the verge of becoming an upper-income country. To ensure sustainable development, a viable growth model that maintains macro-fiscal stability and increases resilience to natural disasters should be formed, said Senior World Bank Country Economist for Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Ralph Van Doorn, at the Sri Lanka development update seminar organized by the World Bank in collaboration with University of Colombos Department of Economics, with emphasis on Managing risks and creating opportunities for sustained growth.
World Bank prepares the Sri Lanka development update twice a year.
In view of this update, Sri Lanka is revisiting its growth model, undertaking structural reforms to mitigate risks and create new opportunities for households, firms, the public sector and macroeconomy.
Van Doorn said, Anticipate, mitigate and communicate should be the salient points in the new growth model. Sri Lanka while mitigating inevitable risks, should grasp opportunities. Macroeconomic performances continue to be broadly satisfactory despite significant challenges including natural disasters. Prepare in advance for natural disasters.
He further said, While pursuing structural reforms to promote competitiveness and to attract more FDI, the country cannot afford to forget its poor or vulnerable. With innovatively deployed policy instruments that support structural adjustment, those adversely impacted must be protected.
Risks should be analyzed and an integrated approach to risk management has to be adopted while ensuring fiscal consolidation. Though fiscal performance has improved, significant risks remain. Tax payments are abused by certain people, said Van Doorn.
He elaborated on liberating trade and paying debts early without waiting for the last minute.
Global growth prospects have increased with benign financial conditions and Sri Lanka must make use of this opportunity. The country must have more focus on exports. It should approach bigger markets to achieve economies-of-scale in production. GSP Plus will improve access to the EU market and it is a big opportunity for Sri Lanka to boost its exports.
FDIs more than doubled in the first half of 2017 due to inflows like the Port City. One-stop-shop for FDI, reforms to the investment climate and trade, reforms for SOE to perform better are needed.
Official reserves increased with forex purchases and external borrowings. Yet external debt related risks remain high.
Sri Lanka has an ageing male society thus labour force must be enhanced with increased participation by females. Female participation in labour here is one of the lowest in the world, said Van Doorn.
A panel discussion took place with Indrajit Aponsu, Ralph Van Doorn and Dr M Ganeshmoorthy.

Worried about stolen Christmas song
Gwen Stefani worried she had stolen familiar lyrics when she was writing a new Christmas song. The singer is currently promoting her festive album You Make It Feel Like Christmas, which features her takes on classic tunes such as Jingle Bells, Silent Night and Let It Snow.
Gwens record also includes original songs, with the star revealing that the words for Christmas Eve sprung to mind while she was out jogging at her country singer boyfriend Blake Sheltons Oklahoma ranch.
I was running and I thought, Ooh maybe Ill trying singing something, maybe something will come, she said during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on November 21. And the whole chorus to this song Christmas Eve came, it was like a prayer. I was like, Oh my gosh, I have to run back!
Because the concept for Christmas Eve came to her so effortlessly, she was concerned that maybe shed heard the song before during a church service. But her parents quickly reassured her that the song was entirely new.
Im like, Did I steal this Is this from church because I feel like I know this song I was convinced that I stole it. I went back and I ended up finishing it, the 48-year-old shared.
Gwen also duets with Blake on the album, with the pair singing You Make It Feel Like Christmas together. And to thank her beau for his contribution, she has already decided on the perfect Christmas gift to give him this year.
Hes really hard to buy for... I think that because he doesnt fit in any of my furniture at my house, hes too big, Im going to get him a couch, she smiled.

Delimitation Gazette does justice to all parties
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha yesterday said the Local Government Delimitation Gazette was flawless and that he tried his best to do justice for all political parties, including the minor parties, with the delimitation process. He stressed that he would at no point sell his integrity as a lawyer and a Presidents Counsel for the sake of politics.
Speaking at the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday, the minister took pains to convince the House that he was not to be blamed for the delay in Local Government elections, while flatly refuting the allegations of his involvement in the petition before the Court of Appeal.
Clarifying on his visit to Malta, the Minister said he went to attend the Commonwealth Local Government Forum.
We presented an application to host that Forum in Sri Lanka in 2019. I presented a Cabinet paper in that regard and mentioned about my visit in it. As a Cabinet Minister representing the SLFP, I went to Malta with the approval of the President and the Cabinet. I did neither flee the country nor go for any personal reason, Minister Musthapha said. The Minister was replying to allegations that he left the country without informing the House or the Prime Minister.
Denying his connection with the petitioners, Musthapha said he values his legal profession more than being an MP.
I have been in the legal profession for the last 20 years. I have carried out my duties as an MP, lawyer and a Presidents Counsel. There was a case filed against me and an Interim Order was given. There were allegations that I was party to this case. Some people dubbed it as a Musthapha vs Musthapha case as the lawyers helped in that case worked in my fathers Chamber at a particular time. Lawyers appear for various purposes, he added.
I worked with good intentions. It is not my fault that the LG polls could not be held due to a court order.
I am not ready to hamper democracy. But somebody has to suffer for the past sins. Some people, who are looking for billy boys, are trying to use me for that purpose.
Despite that, I always do justice to the country, Parliament and my Party, Minister Musthapha clarified.
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake intervening at this point queried as to whether the Minister was not aware of the flaws in the February 17 Gazette for nine months till November 17.
MP Dissanayake stood his ground that it was a Musthapha vs Musthapha case for the reason that the petitioners are close associates of the SLFP ministers.
The Minister insisting that the Gazette was flawless said, I hope my name will be cleared when the court announces its verdict in the case. The Attorney General, who appeared for me, told the court that there is no fault in the Gazette, he said.
Two No Confidence Motions have been filed against me. I am not afraid to go before a peoples court to prove my case as my intentions were clean.
Any citizen can go before the court and file a petition. There can be different interpretations on the motives behind a case. We cannot waste time finding such motives. Neither the President nor the SLFP has any involvement with that case. We have a democratic process. If an Interim Order has been obtained you cannot blame the Legislature or the Executive.
We should respect the court and obey its order, he noted.

Employee skill sets should match up to job supply
The modern world requires young employees with skill sets that engage with the job supply today. With this world that is going forward with technology, the government has seen that it is mandatory to create employee skill sets that match up with the job supply in the world, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He was addressing a gathering at the Nawalapitiya High Tech Training Centre on Sunday.
The event was headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe after laying the foundation stone for the new high-tech training centre in Nawalapitiya. There, Minister Lakshman Kiriella stated that there are a huge number of villagers without jobs.
We cannot give jobs to each and every villager, but we can give the training they need to build up the skill set that the current job supply requires and that is the policy of the United Nations, he said.
Giving everyone a government job does not bring a solution to this and that is why we initiated the high-tech training centre. We assure that if anyone gets training from this centre, they will be eligible to get a job in the job market. Ninety five percent of trainees are eligible for jobs, so I request all of you to take the maximum out of it, he added
The minister thanked Minister Ananda Aluthgamage for giving the idea and to make it a success and stated that it is everyones duty to protect the centre as it creates the best opportunity for all of the village citizens.

Focus of govts growth model driven by private enterprise
The focus of the government has shifted from a growth model that was heavily dependent on public infrastructure spending, to growth driven more by private enterprises, said Malik Samarawickrama, Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade.
He was speaking in Parliament during the Committee Stage of Budget 2018. Following is an extract of the speech made under Trade, Investment, Competitiveness: Moving Sri Lanka Forward.
First we must thank the Minister of Finance, Mangala Samaraweera, for presenting a very progressive forward-looking budget which has given a clear message. An outward-oriented economy is the path towards prosperity of our people.
Our government is now firmly focused on making the country more open to the world and become an attractive place to do business.
I remember as a young professional in 1977 when I heard about the kind of new economic reforms and the opening up of the economy, I was excited and encouraged to become an entrepreneur. That is the kind of spirit that would be kindled in many young people, having heard the direction announced in the Budget 2018 speech.
The focus of our government has shifted from a growth model that was heavily dependent on public infrastructure spending, to growth driven more by private enterprises, exports, and Foreign Direct Investment. Yes, some jobs do get created by government infrastructure projects, but that is neither sustainable nor sufficient mainly for two reasons.
Firstly, our debt burden is too high to keep trying to drive the economy with government spending. We need the private sector to grow this economy. And when I mean the private sector, I am talking about every single Sri Lankan entrepreneur and enterprise, not just the bigger companies. According to the Economic Census, 99% of all establishments in this country are micro, small and medium enterprises.
Our economy is full of enterprising people, enterprising Sri Lankans and we must ensure that we create the best possible environment for them to thrive. Not only for those who are entrepreneurs today, but those who are aspiring to become entrepreneurs tomorrow and in the future.
Secondly, our domestic market is too small to keep trying to drive the economy with inward-looking policies. We have to trade with the world; we have to export to the world, we have to welcome the world to our shores. That is why my Ministry has taken concrete steps to strengthen this aspect of the economy, through a series of initiatives and programmes  focusing on exports, FDI, ease of doing business, trade agreements, and bilateral economic cooperation.
TRADE
The New Trade Policy (NTP) was approved by Cabinet in July 2017 to stimulate growth and job creation by improving the ability of firms to export and to compete for the domestic market through a modern, liberal, simple, transparent and predictable trade regime. The NTP that we launched addresses four key elements:competitiveness through domestic policy reforms, market access and trade facilitation, macroeconomic balance, policy and institutional coherence, helping the adjustment of enterprises and workers.
Hon. Deputy Chairman, the most significant trade policy measures we are undertaking is the negotiation of bilateral Partnership Agreements. The FTA in goods with India is being deepened and it is being broadened to include services, investment, technology and training. We have to recognize that India is expected to be the fastest growing large economy in the world in the coming years, with a middle class consumer base that will be 10 times our own domestic market. Currently six rounds of negotiations of the ETCA have been successfully concluded and the seventh round is schedule to be held in December.
One key objective of the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement with India is to resolve the implementation issues of the existing ISFTA. During the ETCA negotiation, India has agreed to implement an early harvest the day the ETCA comes into force to address outstanding non-tariff barriers in the Indian market as well as many of the existing procedural barriers and delays in Indian ports of entry. This will particularly benefit exporters of perishable items such as fruits, vegetables and fish.
Moreover, Sri Lanka is negotiating the removal of quotas on apparel, pepper and vanaspathi. An important new measure will be the establishment of a Structured Grievance Redressal Mechanism to resolve problems faced by Sri Lanka exporters, in a firm and time bound manner.
A very clear decision has been taken not to include solely Mode 4 based Movement of Independent Professionals under this agreement. It will not be opened up.
Meanwhile, the China Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement will generate nearly 700 million US Dollars of trade, and the apparel sector alone is set to gain 400 million US dollars in new trade. To date, six rounds of negotiations have concluded and the agreement contains nine chapters. During these six rounds, substantial progress has been made.
We are also nearing completion of negotiations on the FTA with Singapore, having completed seven rounds of negotiations. We are particularly focused on encouraging Singaporean investment into Sri Lanka. The agreement is expected to be signed in January 2018.
In addition, GSP Plus has been restored providing preferential market access for 6,000 plus items. If things proceed according to plan, it is possible the narrative will be that Sri Lanka has preferential access to a market of over 3 billion people: China, EU, India, Pakistan and Singapore. In a world where over 190 countries are competing for FDI, this preferential market access can be a unique differentiator.
Mr. Deputy Chairman, as you know Sri Lanka ratified the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement earlier this year. As a key component of this effective national coordination a National Trade Facilitation Committee has been established to drive the implementation of Sri Lankas TFA commitments. On trade facilitation, a single electronic window is established to be in operation in the Customs Department shortly. These measures are intended to reduce the transaction costs of the cross-border movement of goods thereby enhancing the trade competitiveness of the economy.
All these measures are intended to improve the investment climate and trading environment for both domestic and foreign investors.
We are aware of the possible trade disruptions that can occur during the transition period. An Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Measures Bill and a Safeguard Measures Bill are being presented to Parliament soon. The Bills are ready and I think this can be debated and approved in December or January. This will protect domestic business from unfair competition. A trade adjustment package is being developed to improve the resilience of local businesses exposed to increased competition as a result of trade liberalization, support for local industrialists to upgrade machinery and introduce new technology and to provide retraining for workers.
FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT
Foreign Direct Investment into Sri Lanka had been performing poorly, but with efforts that my Ministry is taking, this has begun to turn around. At the Board of Investment we now have leading private sector specialists leading the investment promotion and appraisals, to ensure we get the best of investors to our country, that we facilitate them well and tell other investors about the opportunities here. The approvals and facilitation process for foreign investors is being completely streamlined, with decisions being taken quicker and more transparently than ever before. A One-Stop Shop (OSS) mechanism is being set up to address regulatory inefficiencies and interagency coordination.
An organization structure of the OSS and a web solution for OSS approval process has been developed. The BOI has revised its goals and targets in its new Corporate Plan (2017-2020) with a view to playing a key role in contributing to the sustainable development of the country driven by FDI. This new Corporate Plan presents a bold and new strategic approach to targeting and securing significantly higher levels of high quality FDI.
To complement this, a Single Window Investment Approval Committee was established to facilitate granting of approvals within the shortest possible time. An Investment Facilitation Committee is also in place to fast-track approvals of other line agencies. The flagship investment that we brought in 2017 is the new Logistics and Industrial Zone in Hambantota, with an initial FDI inflow of US Dollars 1.12 billion and a further UD Dollars 500 million is expected within the next two to three years.
This zone is being developed with Chinese investment and we expect a lot of investors, not only from Chinese companies but from many other Asian countries, would be interested in this.
The next will be new industrial zones in Milleniya, Mawathagama, Bingiriya, and Weligama. The zone in Milleniya will bring in investment from the Rojana Corporation of Thailand who is operating seven industrial zones in Thailand mainly with the Japanese Investors.
The new Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 provides a predictability of incentives for new investment, and introduces a new incentives regime with effect from 1st April 2018, which is based on enhanced capital or investment allowances.
EASE OF DOING BUSINESS
Mr. Chairman, our Ministry is committed to leading the effort in improving the ease of doing business for Sri Lankan entrepreneurs and foreign investors.
With the technical assistance of the World Bank, we developed the Roadmap for Investment Climate Reforms, which was launched in July this year. In the last three months alone, eight teams of government officials representing public service delivery agencies have been working on eight high-priority ease of doing business sub-indicators: Starting a business, Dealing with construction permits, Registering a property, Getting credit, Trading across borders, Enforcing contracts, Resolving insolvency, and Protecting minority investors.
Under the eight priority sub-indicators, 15 specific measures to be taken, and the timeframe, responsible agency, and outcomes have been identified and the work is progressing accordingly.
Outcomes for mid-2018 include providing a one-day service for company registration to reduce the time taken to register a company from the current nine days to one day (under the Starting a business pillar); introducing a streamlined online system to reduce the number of days for construction permit issuance from current 115 days to 60 days; and introducing a searchable e-land registry to enable property registration in five days with two steps rather than the current 51 days with nine steps.
The blueprint of the long-awaited National Single Window will be completed by June 2018 paving the way to establish a system that integrates more than 20 agencies dealing with various clearances and approvals in trading across borders.
Our Ministry is continuously monitoring this reform process towards achieving the objective set out by the Hon. Prime Minister of moving up the DBI ranking to be within the top 70 economies by 2020.
These are some of the examples or just some of the many ongoing measures the Government is taking to improve the business climate in Sri Lanka  for domestic enterprises as well as foreign investors - through legal, regulatory and procedural improvements. While this is an ongoing process and benefits will take time to materialize, positive results are already being seen. Internal reports suggest FDI in the first half of 2017 is up by around 80% versus last year. We expected FDIs over US Dollars 1 billion- about US Dollars 1.2 billion- this year and in the next year, I believe, it will go up to above US Dollars 2.5 billion.

With regard to innovation and diversification Mr. Chairman, we have identified that Sri Lanka needs to diversify its economy, and produce as well as export a range of new and innovative products and services.
With technical input from Harvard Universitys Centre for International Development, the teams comprising officials from BOI, EDB and Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority have been working over the last year to improve our economic diversifications targeting foreign investors and identifying new export and investment sectors. This is been directly handled by the State Minister of International Trade, Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe.
We are also close to finalizing a new National Export Strategy NES - with a focus on competitiveness and innovation. The aim is to grow exports to US$ 20 billion over the next five years in sectors ranging from high value and high quality food and beverages, to leisure boats, IT services, and electronic components. The NES will be presented to Cabinet within the next two months. What was unique and valuable about this exercise is the close collaboration of the private sector. Every single section of the N.E.S. was developed through a participatory approach with over 450 industry leaders, SMEs, and public sector officials being consulted.
Another valuable part of this is the strong focus on actions - Action Plans have been developed for each sector and each trade support function. We want to make sure that implementation begins from January itself. I am happy to announce that several proposals made through the NES process have been included in the Budget 2018 by the Finance Minister.
We also recognized the need to create an eco-system that promotes innovative thinking and creates new products and services. We have embarked on producing a new framework for this  the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Strategy  with the technical input of the World Bank and co-leadership of the private sector. This will be implemented jointly with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research and Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The strategy focuses on upgrading quality and technology of export-oriented SMEs, create the conditions for startups to emerge, and reorient and upgrade R&D institutions that matter for export growth.
DEEPENING STRATEGIC ECONOMIC COOPERATION
Mr. Chairman, with Sri Lanka gaining the respect and recognition of the international community once more, we have been able to forge several economic cooperation agreements with key countries. These will help improve our trade performance, attract more and better FDI, and create good job opportunities for our people.
We entered into a roadmap for further investment promotion between Japan and Sri Lanka, and it is a result of the Sri Lanka  Japan Economic Policy Dialogue following the visit of the Hon. Prime Minister to Japan in October 2015. A Joint Working Group has been established to take this work forward, and two high level meetings were held this year. We are embarking on a similar programme with Korea, for both investment promotion as well as transfer of technology and know-how. The Economic Cooperation Agreement is due to be signed at the end of this month, during a visit of H.E. the President to Korea.
During the recent visit of the Australian Prime Minister, we entered into a cooperation programme with Australia, focused on trade and investment promotion.
We re-launched the EU-Sri Lanka Investor Dialogue in 2017, and up to now 3 rounds have been held this year to resolve trade and investment related problems and grow the bilateral economic cooperation.
These leverages nicely on the regaining of GSP Plus in May, which was a great achievement of the government and was only possible because of the respect of the international community that the President and Prime Minister have regained for Sri Lanka.
Mr. Chairman, the people of this country are already seeing the benefits of regaining GSP Plus. Apparel exports to the EU in the first nine months of this year have increased by 1.67 billion US dollars. In the pre-GSP Plus period, apparels were growing at just 2%, but in the few months of regaining GSP Plus, it has surged by 11.3%. Fisheries exports are up by 40% compared to the same period last year.
The GSP Plus scheme is giving our exporters a renewed opportunity to succeed in the EU market in sectors like fresh and processed vegetables and fruits, coconut products, seafood, ceramics, footwear, and of course apparels. It is also promoting backward integration, resulting in the setting up of new industries and creating new employment opportunities for the youth of our country.
THE YEAR AHEAD
With regard to the year ahead, Sir, our Ministry will focus on expanding our trade and investment even further by bringing in good investors to Sri Lanka who will create good job opportunities, and who will help Sri Lanka plug in to global value chains. We will focus very strongly on operationalizing new investment zones and attracting investors into them  in Hambantota, Milleniya, Weligama, Bingiriya and so on and attracting investors into them.
We will focus strongly on implementing the National Export Strategy that will diversify our export base, boost competitiveness of our exporters, and win new consumers in new markets. Specifically, my Ministry welcomes the Budget proposal to launch an Exporter Market Access Programme that we will implement through the Export Development Board, and also the new IT Initiative to take this emerging sector to new heights.
Through strategic economic cooperation agreements with new countries, we will invite more partners to help Sri Lanka achieve its goals of prosperity and economic transformation. Through improvements to the ease of doing business as well as new initiatives to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship, we will create a new culture of enterprise in Sri Lanka. To that end, the proposals on Enterprise Sri Lanka announced by the Finance Minister are extremely valuable and I look forward to working together to support these efforts, and achieve the Vision 2025 of this government.

Government policy ignores SME role in shipping
I have been following up on the recent articles published in the newspapers and social media relating to the new budget proposal. The proposal for liberalization of shipping agency and freight forwarding industries seems to be one of the most debated budget proposals this time.
Unfortunately, I feel the government has been completely mislead by certain advisors to believe that the Shipping Industry in Sri Lanka only revolves around a handful of local agents that represents global container operators, completely overlooking the large segment of SMEs like us who have supported the growth of this industry through "thick and thin". In fact, we the SMEs service twice the number of non conventional vessels that call the ports of Colombo, Galle, Trincomalee and also serve hundreds of ships at off port limits (OPL).
It is totally incorrect to imply that only a few agents are running the shipping industry in Sri Lanka. There has been malicious attacks directed on few leading companies, accusing them of monopolizing and controlling the shipping industry. These couple of big players have been in this business for over decades. Their survival does not by any means depend on liberalization of the industry due to their diversity and international reach. Should there be a change in policy it is us the SMEs that will have to watch the foreign companies sweep us off our feet.
It is rather unfortunate that the government seems to be quite ignorant about the significant role that we as SMEs play. We have a huge bearing in making Sri Lanka a maritime hub in the region which is the aspiration of the government as well.
It was our entrepreneurial initiative to develop the non conventional business in the country. The attack on the big players will not only wipe out few hundreds of SMEs, it will also open doors for fly-by-night operators to benefit which would result in the country losing control over the entire maritime industry.
Another widely discussed topic is Maersk's keen interest in expanding their footprint in Sri Lanka and their plans to move back-office operations to Colombo from India. Maersk is the only Container Shipping Line operating in Sri Lanka with a controlling stake. The question is, what prevented them from doing so all these years
However, we appeal to the government to ensure that these business proposals are accompanied with reasonable investments and proper regulations are implemented within the industry to control the cash outflows. Policy changes and decision making should be done whilst always being mindful to safeguard our national interest.

Govt. should aim for social, economical development
The government should have a vision to take the country forward. That vision should be aimed for social and economic development rather than for personal aggrandisement or enriching one's family and relatives, said former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
She was addressing a meeting held at the Bodhimangalaramaya Pattalagedara on November 26 to mark the distribution of equipment among community organisations in the area and the temple.
Kumaratunga said the country needed leads with a proper backbone to ensure social and economic development in the country. This included members of the Cabinet, Provincial Councils, as well as Pradeshiya Sabhas.
All of them should be leaders who keep the welfare of the people at heart. Curiously, certain people asked for a mandate from the people claiming that they were instrumental in winning the war. Such claimants only spoiled the country rather than winning the war," Kumaratunga said.
She said, actually it was she and her government who won almost three-fourths of the war.
What was the real difficulty confronted in taking the country forward It was because the treasury had been totally emptied by the previous regime in addition to leaving behind an immense debt burden. Those who engaged in robbery in the past had started to spread dissension in the country, she said.
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said the most significant development in recent times was the decision taken by the two main political parties to join hands and form a national unity government. But this was not an easy task, because there are people who had attacked each other when the other party won elections in the past. But this system of rivalry had to be changed as done during the last two elections. The time has come to unite in the general interest of the country, relegating party interests to the background, said Minister Arjuna Ranatunga.
Ranatunga said, sometimes it was baffling him to think how the President and Prime Minister were taking the consensus government forward with equal finesse by overcoming differences between the two main parties of the government.

ICT becoming a top forex earner for Sri Lanka
The Sri Lanka ICT sector landscape is fast changing and the industry is moving to be a top foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka, said Jayantha De Silva, President and CEO, IFS Sri Lanka.
At a media briefing held in view of their 20 years of operations in Sri Lanka, he said that when they started, Sri Lankas ICT-based export revenue was around US$ 20 million and in 2015 it has gone passed the US$ one billion mark (Sri Lanka's IT/BPM sector vision for 2022 is a US$ 5 billion revenue, 200,000 direct jobs and 1,000 start-ups.)
De Silva also stated, IFS has been a key player in driving the IT/BPO industry in Sri Lanka towards building capacity. We pioneered many innovative concepts in the industry and initiated concepts such as the scholarship scheme offered to A/L students with the objective of supporting the industry to build capacity. To date, over 300 scholarships have been awarded and it has now become an industry standard.
We will continue to expand our scholarship program while working closely with major universities to develop our future generation, encouraging them to be a part of this dynamic industry. We are now a complete Resource Centre catering globally and have achieved significant milestones within the ICT industry as we celebrate two decades of excellence.
The Sales and Consulting unit for IFS in South Asia operates from its Colombo office and markets, implements and supports IFS applications in companies within the South Asian region.
The company currently supports more than 120 companies across Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Thailand, Seychelles, and Uganda. "We ensure that our customers have a trouble free experience, a vital element in our relationship with our customers.
He said that have introduced several software to the tea, apparel and other sectors and also to large foreign and local corporates.
Alastair Sorbie, CEO at IFS, commented: Consistent and stable growth has been the secret of our success around the world, which would not have been possible if IFS could not attract and retain top talent. The importance of building the best team of industry experts is no more pronounced than in Sri Lanka  not only is Sri Lanka home to the largest number of IFS employees, but the local team is also key to the success of so many fundamental parts of our global business.
Fuelling our global growth from Sri Lanka has been one of the best decisions we have made.
The IFS team in Sri Lanka has been key to IFSs global success, which per the companys Q3 2017 financial results, shows year-to-date license growth up 18%. Key global initiatives like the IFS Academy (training and certification), IFS Labs (innovation), global support center as well as important aspects of product development are all run from the companys Sri Lankan offices.
IFS counts over 120 of Sri Lankas top companies as customers of its enterprise software. These customers use IFS solutions to manufacture and distribute goods, maintain assets, and manage service-focused operations.
IFSs 2,800 employees support more than 1 million users worldwide from its network of local offices and through a growing ecosystem of partners. (SS)

## Title: Liberalisation of shipping: good move

Liberalisation of shipping: good move
Finally, the government of Sri Lanka has come to its senses that liberalising of shipping is needed for Sri Lanka to become a vibrant maritime economy and hub.
It is only right that we commend the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe and Minister of Finance, Mangala Samaraweera for this bold step taken towards enriching our countries economy and competition to prevail for the betterment of the end consumer.
When the big shipping giants such as Maersk, MSC, CMA-CGM, APL, NYK, MOL, Hapag Lloyd, Cosco, OOCL and Evergreen can have their own offices here and contribute to the Sri Lankan economy having an agent will be unnecessary. It is the case of economies of scale.
By not having agency houses and inviting the shipping companies to open up their own offices in Sri Lanka we are promoting them to bring in their logistics activities, supply chain activities and cold chain activities to our country which will help our country to be the No 1 maritime hub in the Indian ocean.
As the vessel owners will be opening up their own offices in Sri Lanka, they will be pumping much needed foreign exchange into our economy by purchasing buildings to house their offices and paying higher salaries to their employees, unlike agency houses. This is a good opportunity for our graduates in the Katubedda University who study the logistics degree as they would be provided with jobs with high salaries by the vessel owners compared to working in an agency house where the agent would pay a salary of maybe Rs. 30,000.
For the case of losing foreign exchange, this is yet another bogus strategy set out by the shipping agents to stop the liberalisation process in Sri Lanka, foreign exchange would increase once restrictions are removed.
As the Principals/Carriers will make Sri Lanka their transhipment hub where all containers will have to transship through the Colombo port this will increase our foreign revenue two folds but by having an agent represent the principal they would not act on the interest of the principal but act only to protect their own interest. It is not Sri Lanka who will lose the foreign exchange but the people with hidden agendas as the foreign exchange will stop accumulating into their own pockets and they are uneasy about this situation.
If the so-called top agency houses are afraid to lose their agencies why not after liberalisation, they too work for their principals for higher salaries this they cannot do as they want to keep all the foreign exchange for themselves so that they can hire people for far less salaries and have shared documentation centres which are banned in the shipping industry as they lead to rate fixing and rate discussion of lines which have been cartelised in these top agency houses.
Some may argue that the shipping lines will be able to take them earning out of the country, Yes, of course, they will take their earnings out of Sri Lanka but they will pay tax and dividends on earning before doing so. This is yet another bogus strategy of the so-called two or three top agency houses in Sri Lanka to retain the agencies with them and not allow their principals to open up their own offices.
By most of the shipping agencies being with two to three players in the industry, this also promotes cartelisation of shipping lines into two or three groups which are forbidden by international law.
If need be the government of Sri Lanka can get the shipping lines to invest 50% of their profit inside our country and help build infrastructure, hotels, maritime universities etc. which they will be happy to do so as a part of their CSR initiatives.
The government should not head to the pressure of the so-called association of shipping agents as it is controlled by two key players in the industry with vested interest. Thus there is no independent opinion from the so-called association of agents. The two top players in the industry use the association to get things done their own way and only to protect their own interest this is known to many of the members in the association.
Due to the greed of these top players in the industry the small time, SME players have been crushed and cartelisation of the industry has happened for decades.
Further, the top shipping agency houses should be protecting the interest of their principals and not their own interest. Their action today shows that they do not want to protect the interest of their principals but their own interest by lying to the government and to the general public about the loss of foreign exchange and jobs, this is truly their hidden agenda.
Liberalisation will encourage competition, which the top shipping agency houses are afraid of as they have hidden agendas to cartelise and fix rates in the industry. Competition is vital for a growing economy like ours and will help benefit the end consumer.
Due to the agencies cartelising with two to three agency houses, the lack of competition in the shipping industry is only filling the pockets of these agency houses with agency commission as per the tariff set by them since they control their own association.
This is truly a bold step and the general public should commend the government is steering Sri Lanka on the right path in order to become a global logistics hub in the Indian Ocean.

Accelerated rural road development projects underway in Matara
According to Matara District Parliamantarian and Co-Chairman of the Matara District Development Coordinating Committee Buddika Pathirana, the present government has initiated accelerated undeveloped rural road development projects in the district of Matara and these programs are presently underway at Divisional Secretariat Division level in the district.
Undeveloped rural road improvement projects which have been started in the Malimbada, Athuralia and Akuressa Divisional Secretariat Divisions have made a noticeable progress at the moment. Under the program development work on Wilpita-Panugala road, Urumutha-Devala road, Galpatha Junction-Polhena road, Kalugala-Deegala Bodhiya road, Diyalape-Middellaketiya road, Ihala Kiyanduwa Olagalle road, Weliketiya-Dolamulla road and Ganhela-Asmagoda-Isurupitiya road in above Divisional Secretariat Divisions have successfully been completed at the moment.
"In addition to these development activities, many other selected roads are almost nearing completion and they too are anticipated to be over prior to end of this year," MP Buddika Pathirana said.
"The speedy enhancement of daily livelihood activities of the remote rural people would be boosted further with the completion of proposed road improvement programs. All these road development activities are scheduled to be finished before the end of this year.
The provision of better road transport facilities for people in far-off difficult areas in the Matara district would be the primary objective of all these endeavours and decentralized budgetary funds allocated for the district of Matara are utilised in this regard." Matara District MP Buddika Pathirana added.

Petition challenging the Delimitation Gazette
AG URGES COURT OF APPEAL TO DISMISS PETITION
Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya yesterday filed motion in Court of Appeal moving that the writ petition which challenged the legality of Gazette Notification on the Delimitation committee Report be dismissed and to refuse the extension of the Interim Order on the next hearing date. The Attorney General in the motion also requested to advance the hearing of the writ petition which challenged the legality of the Gazette Notification on the Delimitation Committee Report, to November 30.
On November 22, the Court of Appeal had issued an Interim Order suspending the operation of the Gazette Notification dated February 17, 2017 on the Delimitation Committee Report, until December 4.
Filing a motion in the Court of Appeal, the Attorney General informed that there is an urgent need to ensure that the franchise of the people is not affected.
As a matter of national importance, advance the hearing into the Interim Order of the application to November 30, the Attorney General stated.
The Attorney General further informed Court that the Elections Commission has by a notice dated November 27, 2017 called for elections in respect of 93 of 133 local authorities not covered by the concerned gazette and intends to call for elections in respect of the 40 remaining authorities upon the rectification of the typographical errors contained in the said Gazette. The Court had issued an Interim order consequent to a writ petition filed by six electors who challenged the legality of the Gazette Notification issued by the Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister on the Delimitation Committee Report with regard to the boundaries in respect of Local Authorities.
The Court of Appeals three - judge - Bench comprising Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya, Justice Kumuduni Wickremesinghe and Justice Shiran Gunaratne had observed that in promulgating the Gazette notification, the Local Government Minister has acted ultra vires the powers vested in him under section 3D of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance.
The Court further held that if any electoral process commenced in terms of the concerned gazette notification, irreparable damage would be caused to the peoples franchise rights. Six electors representing several Local Government institutions have filed a writ petition in the Court of Appeal challenging the legality of a Gazette Notification bearing No.2006/44 dated February 17, 2017 amending the boundaries, number of members and the constituents in respect of Local Authorities.
This petition had been filed by six electors representing the Colombo Municipal Council, Kandy Municipal Council, Panduwasnuwara Pradeshiya Sabha, Hali-Ela Pradeshiya Sabha and the Embilipitiya Pradeshiya Sabha.
The petitioners cited Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha, Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry Secretary, as respondents.

Bali volcano: Mt Agung ash shuts airport for second day

Indonesian officials have shut the international airport in Bali for a second day, as Mount Agung spews volcanic ash into the atmosphere.
Massive plumes of dark ash were seen reaching as high as 3km (2 miles) from the summit of the rumbling volcano, which began erupting last week.
Officials raised the alert to the highest level on Monday, fearing an imminent major eruption.
More than 100,000 people have been ordered to evacuate the vicinity.
Volcanic ash can damage aeroplane engines or even cause them to fail, and also clogs fuel and cooling systems. Pilot visibility can also be hampered.
The Transportation Ministry initially closed the Ngurah Rai airport on Monday morning for 24 hours, cancelling more than 400 flights and stranding 59,000 travellers.
On Tuesday, they announced they would extend the closure to Wednesday 07:00 local time (00:00 GMT).
The airport on neighbouring Lombok island however has been re-opened, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's national disaster agency.
Authorities have also arranged for buses to take tourists to ferry terminals.
The volcano is about 70km from the popular tourist areas of Kuta and Seminyak.
The disaster agencysaid in a separate statement (in Indonesian)that as of Tuesday morning, the volcano was still emitting thick ash clouds and that "rays of flares from the glowing lava" were also observed overnight.
Besides ash,streams of rock mixed with water known as laharshave also been spotted flowing down from the mountain. Officials have warned people to stay away from them.
Thousands of villagers living within a 10km exclusion zone around the volcano are now in shelters.
But as of Monday, an estimated 40,000 people still remained in their homes, as some said they still felt safe while others did not want to leave their livestock.
Authorities have warned thatthey may forcibly evacuate peopleif they do not move to shelters soon.
Inside the exclusion zone
A large banner reads: "You're entering active volcanic hazard zone." But looking around, you wouldn't know.
Just behind the sign Seriyani is selling flowers for offers to the Balinese Hindu gods. She says she is worried, but needs to stay here and work to feed the family.
"When it really erupts I will run," she says with a nervous laugh.
Further in the exclusion zone we find a school open. Here the teacher is showing the children how to put on simple surgical masks. To protect them from the ash, the headmaster tells me.
The volcano has been rumbling for weeks now he says so they don't want to move yet and be left in limbo.
Authorities say they will force people to evacuate. But those still on the mountain haven't heard that.

Beira Lake Intervention Area Development Plan launched
The Beira Lake Intervention Area Development Plan was launched by the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Patali Champaka Ranawaka, yesterday. Subsequent to the launch, the Beira Lake area will now be referred to as Ran Masu Pura.
The proposed zoning plan of the Urban Development Authority hopes to get the optimum economic value of the area and realize the highly livable and economically vibrant megapolis that the government has envisioned for the nation.
The financial support to the proposed zoning plan will be provided by the World Bank. The plan proposes to develop lands in the immediate vicinity of Beira Lake for hotels and tourism activities. Lands located near Vauxhall Street are to accommodate a leisure park for the public.
The launching ceremony was held at JAIC Hilton Colombo, yesterday morning, with the participation of Singaporean experts facilitating the project, officials of the Urban Development Authority and other stakeholders.
Minister Ranawaka addressing the gathering said, There was a time people coined a term, All garbage goes to Beira Lake. This Beira Lake area which was once a glorious economic hub in the country turned into an area full of anti-social activities.
Now our main object is to develop the Multimodal Transport Hub at Fort/Pettah area where the Beira Lake vicinity will become an important part. We have already called for proposals from investors for the first step of this Multimodal Transport Hub and the second stage of the project will start in 2018, Minister Ranawaka said.
By 2023, we will establish the Light Railway, the elevated highway and modernized railway facility, all of which will be interconnected with the proposed Multimodal Transport Hub.
The area surrounding Beira Lake, which will be directly connected with this hub, will also be developed as the main economic area connecting with the Port City project, Minister Ranawaka added.
Minister Ranawaka said land development is the most important part of this project. There are lands owned by several government agencies and there is more land which belongs to both the government and private individuals or companies. Most of the government agencies, such as the Ports Authority and Lanka Sathosa, have agreed to release their lands for the proposed project. The Beira Lake Intervention Area Development Plan includes the systematic strategy to develop all these lands. The first stage of such land development will begin by 2018, he said.
Minister Ranawaka while pointing out that the people living in Vauxhall area will be moving out willingly to make space for the development project, commended President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for allocating Rs. 1300 million for the relocation programme of the people. He also observed that this allocation expedited the Beira Lake development project.
Minister Ranawaka expressed his confidence that the development project will turn the Beira Lake area into a resource-park and a wealth-centre which will become a gold mine that contributes the most to the development of the country.

Beyonce unveils festive sweaters and ornaments
Beyonce has unveiled a line of Christmas sweaters and festive ornaments. Following the success of her first merchandise line last November 16, which celebrated her album Lemonade, the superstar has dropped another range of fun items and products.
Available to purchase from her website now, the capsule collection features T-shirts, sweatshirts, onesies, crop tops and even sleepsuits for babies.
The line is emblazoned with a number of slogans, such as Have a Thicc Holiday, Sis the Season, Beyonce Holiday Sweater, and her nickname Yonce.
One T-shirt features a portrait of Beyonce posing in black dress with a reindeer ear headband on her head, which is screen printed with the word Holidayonce on the back.
The Formation singer also has Christmas decorations covered and offers up tree ornaments printed with her portrait, the word Yonce or Slay bells as well as a motif of a bumblebee wearing a red and white Santa hat. In addition, there is a red phone cover and wrapping paper.
The merchandise is priced from $12 (9) for a satin Christmas tree bauble to $85 (64) for an adult onesie, which come in three bold colour options; purple, green and grey.
While Beyonces designs will no doubt be snapped up by keen fans, shes not the only celebrity to launch a line of holiday merchandise this year.
Whoopi Goldberg has designed 12 sweaters perfect to chill out in after overindulging this Yuletide, with her inclusive line including a Chanukah sweater and a Rabbi sitting with an elf design for those celebrating the Jewish holiday, and a Kwanzaa sweater honouring the African holiday celebration, among other options.
*NSYNC have also released a line of merchandise to celebrate the re-release of their 1998 album Home For Christmas on vinyl. Though the boy band, made up of Justin Timberlake, Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, Chris Kirkpatrick and JC Chasez, called it quits in 2002 they have now made the record available to purchase from Urban Outfitters - but accompanying sweaters, T-shirts, and accessories have already sold out.

Justice League
Bigger but not better
We mostly get movies which have featured one or two prominent superheroes. Therefore five or six of your favourite superheroes in one movie is a much looked forward to treat indeed. This was the hype that is created around Justice League  the movie which brings Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash, and Cyborg together.
The plus point of the movie is that most of the action is highly enjoyable. Some of the jokes too make you chuckle and sit back to enjoy the action.
The whole Justice League team has ample chemistry to carry the movie. Though Superman seems to be the supreme superhero in the movie Gal Gadot steals his thunder as the charismatic Amazonian Wonder Woman. She manages to outshine the whole team not because she is its only female member but because of the energy she generates on the screen. Batman deserves more screen time since he is next in line to Superman but his character is not explored well. Since he is the one who unites all, director Zack Snyder should have done justice to his role by bringing his super powers into the limelight.
The biggest downside of the movie is probably that it is old wine in a new bottle. A villain who emerges from the past to take over the world and is beaten by a super group of united beings is a much hackneyed theme in superhero movies today. We recently had a taste of it in the latest Thor: Ragnarok movie so it is tiring to see the same subject matter in focus in the next film to hit theaters.
Some chunks also seem to be missing in the tale. The action seems to be rushed with evidently last-minute CGI patchwork. The villain too is not scary enough for us to get any goosebumps.
The characters and big names linked with the movie save it from tanking in the box office but sans these factors this would have been a movie which would have been left best ignored.

Boomers still leaping the hoops with noisy whoops!
Last weeks column dealt with what was known as the Baby Boomer generation. The focus was largely on the childhood of people born between the end of World War II - the 1945 and the late 1960s period - during which the populations and economies of certain nations were set to recover and boom.
Yes, life was a lot simpler for everyone in those spacious times when everyone looked out for everyone else. Children were born into families where having many siblings was common. It was understood that it was part of the responsibility of older children to take care of the younger ones. Women were increasingly attending hospital to give birth, but home births with the assistance of local midwives were still widespread.
For us Boomer's, who were part of this island nations biggest generation, childhood from our perspective was a magical era. Some of us ageing Boomers spent the last few weeks enjoying a magic carpet ride back in time to when kids and the ice cream truck ran freely through the neighbourhood and milk and the newspaper were carefully delivered to your doorstep.
In general, monetary wealth may have been rare but there was a certain financial equality among friends and neighbours. People were resourceful and 'made do'. A bank account in those days was widely regarded as a status symbol, particularly for those who did not seem quite sure on which rung of the social ladder they stood. Anyone who was someone did very little in the sphere of banking although they made it a point to complain to everyone that they were being numbed with numerals while trying balance their balances. Many homes in those days used to have large, iron safes, where the family heirlooms were deposited along with fat wads of cash neatly folded according to their denominations. Those safes were pretty safe by any standard and were pretty effective against both burglars and in-house sleight-of-hand artistes.
Chemical reaction
It could probably have been my imagination, or possibly some sort of chemical reaction with the salt of the earth, which had something to do with the fact that those local coins shone brighter than ever. Blame it on inflation, recession or whatever the analysts may propound to explain the present financial malaise, but todays coins which look beggared in comparison are fiscally impoverished to boot. The old coins retained their value in the very metal in which they were minted, providing a natural hedge against inflation. They had a distinct glitter about them and went a long way in helping satisfy the indulgences of sweet-toothed rapscallions.
And talk about the tempting arrays of sweets displayed in giant glass bottles available at every street corner kadey, costing only a few cents a handful. Even during the time of the local seenibola industrial revolution who could ever forget the tangerine flavoured orange-yellow narang-beek, the jaw-cracking bultos, black bulls-eye peppermints, or the tiny cummin-stuffed mee-betty candy, named disgustingly after rat droppings. Do you remember the local Candy Cigarettes with a red end to simulate a burning fag. There we were, trying to look glamorous, posing with a truly nasty-tasting smoke lolly dangling off the corner of our lips. Makes my eyes cross just to remember it. Over the years, weve seen a lot of things come and go such as hula-hoops, vinyl records, Hawaiian shirts, poodle skirts and stiff buckram dresses.
General amusement
At most parties there were many damsels in this dress and they hardly looked in any form of distress. Children always found ways to amuse themselves and were inventive too. Nothing went to waste that could be used to create games and toys and general amusement. Matches, corks, quills, pebbles, straw, flowers, rags, clock spinners, rope and wood - with imagination and a little skill - could create all sorts of playthings. Twigs and branches in the right hands provided catapults, whistles, pop-guns and spinning sticks.
The latter were used to spin tops carved from a wooden thread-spool. A piece of rope could create a simple swing and a hillside could become a slide. A wheel or used tyre was a toy as imagination is the mother of invention.
Remember playing Hora Police or Cops and Robbers without the societal baggage that it carries now We used to play with fake guns and real bows and arrows. Do kids still do that Can they run amok through yards and across streets pretending to shoot other children There was no moralising on guns or killing  it was just good fun. After all, the police were the good guys. That's all we knew back then.
We were given air guns for our tenth birthdays. No one lost an eye or was maimed or killed. We rode bikes or walked to a friends house and knocked on the door or just yelled for them. Most boomers were inquisitive, experimental and courageous. I must admit we risked our limbs and lives in death defying stunts, such as indulging in the odd roof-top jumping as well. We would gallop across an expanse of concrete slab some 20 feet high and propel ourselves perilously onto the branches of a convenient mango tree. The tender branches bent but were able to sustain our weight. And oh yes, who can forget how we swung on a rope tied to the branches of a 60 foot custard apple tree yelling our heads off in true Tarzan fashion as we swung more than 40 feet high and leapt onto the branches of another giant tree.
The yelling was triggered by both fear and exhilaration as we flew through the air with the greatest of ease. Yes, we were all wild and free youth with such a spirit for life. Now to make the swinging adventure more authentically Tarzan-like we wore swimming trunks.
One of the funniest incidents of the tree trapeze act occurred when a friend named Ferna swung smartly and made a perfect leap to the tree opposite. While dangling on the branch his loose trunks slithered down his legs and fell to the ground.
To add to his embarrassment a bevy of neighbourhood girls were part of the audience tittering fit to die as they watched the genuine ape man unclothed in all his natural glory!
Somehow we survived it all and are now comfortably entrenched in the millennium, striving to remain a vital force in the world and vigorously continuing down the winding road on our protracted, strange trip. We arent slowing down anytime soon. Some of us are still raising grandkids.
We are still active boomers who dont really worry about having enough moolah to take us from here to the stairway to heaven. We love everything from reading and writing to running the most daring gauntlets. And we still get a kick taking an occasional whirl with our Hula-Hoops. Yes even as toddlers we made bathtubs into whirlpools.
No siree, there was never hope of taming the Boomer tornados.

Bottas holds off Hamilton  in Abu Dhabi GP
ABU DHABI  Valtteri Bottas survived several laps of high-speed pressure from his Mercedes team-mate and world champion Lewis Hamilton to claim a memorable victory in Sunday's season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
The 28-year-old Finn, who started from pole position, led from the lights to the flag apart from a spell following his first pit stop when the four-time champion Briton was in control.
It was Bottas' third career victory, all of them recorded since he joined Mercedes to partner the 32-year-old Hamilton in January following the unexpected exit of 2016 champion German Nico Rosberg.
"This is a really important win for me after having a pretty difficult start to the second half of the year," said Bottas.
"We Finns don't show much emotion but it doesn't mean we don't have any. I am so happy. There has been so much support. I can't show it too much but I feel good."
Hamilton came home four seconds behind Bottas, having eased off in the closing laps.
The Briton scored points in every race of the season, underlining his dominance this year.
Four-time former champion Sebastian Vettel finished a lonely third for Ferrari, as the two Mercedes men delivered celebratory 'doughnuts' for the crowd.
It was Vettel's 99th career podium and his 13th of the season.
Kimi Raikkonen was fourth in the second Ferrari ahead of Max Verstappen of Red Bull and Nico Hulkenberg for Renault, whose sixth-place finish assured Renault of sixth in the constructors' championship ahead of Toro Rosso.
Sergio Perez came home seventh ahead of his Force India team-mate Esteban Ocon, Fernando Alonso of McLaren Honda and Felipe Massa, in his last F1 race before retirement, for Williams.
Australian Daniel Ricciardo, who was fourth on the grid, failed to finish his Red Bull for the third time in four outings.
Hamilton was vocal in his dislike of the narrow track.
"It's impossible to pass here man!" he said. "I was like - where are all the back-markers... They've got to change this track."
He added: "Big congratulations to Valtteri, he did an amazing job to hold me off."
As the sun went down at the warm Yas Marina Circuit, Bottas avoided repeating his poor start in Brazil two weeks ago and pulled clear from pole into the first turn ahead of Hamilton.
Behind them, Vettel stayed third ahead of Ricciardo and Raikkonen while, at the back of the field, Dane Kevin Magnussen spun and recovered in his Haas.
The two Mercedes men were producing a duel at the front and were 2.5 seconds ahead of Vettel.
The two Silver Arrows continued to pull clear before the pit stops began, Bottas arriving for new tyres after 21 laps. Hamilton inherited the lead and pushed before pitting himself after 24 laps, re-joining second again.
By then Ricciardo's race was over after he had retired with a hydraulics problem, his third early shower in four races.
At the front, Bottas appeared to be struggling on his new super-soft tyres with Hamilton applying pressure and reducing the gap to 0.9 seconds.
His superior speed, however, did not allow him to find a way to pass his team-mate in the turbulent air behind him.
The pressure told on Hamilton when he ran over a kerb at turn 17 and then, at the same place, went off the track completely. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff could afford to smile, knowing that both championships were won already.
This pushed Hamilton back to 1.8 seconds behind while behind him, Carlos Sainz had to retire when his front left wheel was not properly attached to his Renault in a pit stop.
Hamilton continued to deliver fast laps and cut the gap to 1.1 seconds, but struggled to gain in the third sector through the marina and hotel complex and was clearly frustrated by the lack of overtaking.
The Briton continued to push and with six laps remaining cut the gap to 0.5 seconds, but Bottas stayed cool as the champion loomed in his mirrors and hoped for a mistake by his team-mate.
By this stage, Vettel was more than 20 seconds adrift, but 19 seconds clear of fourth-placed Ferrari team-mate Raikkonen.
Hamilton scored 363 to finish top in the final drivers' standings ahead of Vettel on 317, Bottas on 305 and Raikkonen on 205.
In the constructors, Mercedes led the way with 668 ahead of Ferrari on 522, Red Bull on 368 and Force India on 177.
The opening race of 2018 in Melbourne is a 17-week European winter away on March 28, and will herald a new era with halo cockpit protection devices for the first time. Bottas, as he said, plans to be ready.

Captain expresses disappointment over team performance
Monday: Skipper Dinesh Chandimal expressed his disappointment with his teams sub-standard performance in the second Test against India which they lost by a record margin of an innings and 239 runs here on Monday.
We spoke a lot of things after we lost to India 3-0. We wanted to compete against them. We spoke of the need to take it to the final day. Then only they will panic and it will present us an opportunity. That is what we failed to do in this game. I am really disappointed as captain, said Chandimal at the post-match press conference.
We talk a lot of these things at team meetings and stuff. But when we go out to the middle, we fail to produce the results. We have experience and there are some good young players, but we fail to get into good form. Its up to the individual players. At least in the next game, I hope that the batsmen will produce runs. Theres no excuse if you cant make 400 runs in the first innings. Then only you can compete against India. I hope the batters will do something in the next game, he said.
Chandimal in partnership with tailender Suranga Lakmal showed the rest of the batters that there were no demons on the pitch when they added 58 runs for the ninth wicket.
We won the toss and the best days to bat in a Test match is the first three days. There was hardly anything on that wicket. The batsmen needed to take responsibility. We know that India are playing only four bowlers. If we could have taken their bowlers into the third spell, they will be in trouble, said Chandimal.
They are also humans and fatigue will get to them. That was our plan. The batters failed to execute those plans. Had we done that we could have fought better.
Chandimal said that he could not put a finger on why the batsmen failed to execute their plans in the middle.
We speak a lot and train harder. The responsibility taken by the batsmen has to increase. When we go out to the middle, we need to be positive. Then only the bowlers will make a mistake. We speak a lot about it. If we are negative, they will get on top, said Chandimal.
Test cricket is much to do with temperament. You cant play Test cricket like you play ODIs and T20 cricket. In Tests, you get a variety of situations. We cannot get away by saying that I need to play my natural game. Sometimes according to conditions and situations you need to adapt and if you dont do that, it will be tough for us.
Commenting on the worst Test defeat suffered by Sri Lanka, Chandimal said, Its very sad. As captain, I came to India with big hopes. I was hopeful we will be competitive given the team we have. We need to come out of the hole that we have dug ourselves into. Just three or four players trying to get us out of the hole wont help us. Everyone has to make an effort. We have 15 players and I hope all 15 will have that desire to do well.
We need to get confidence about our game. Take a look at what mistakes we made and the positives we did. I thought we bowled and fielded well. You cant do much when you have put 200 runs on the board. We did well to keep them down to 3.5 runs an over whereas in Sri Lanka we conceded 4.5 to 5 runs an over, Chandimal added.
The fielding was top class throughout the 176 overs. But the main thing when it comes to Test cricket is batting well in the first innings when you are playing a good team. Otherwise, its tough to compete against a team like India. We have to discuss about getting 400 runs on the board.
We saw a big change in the first Test. Everyone got a feeling that we could win the game. We should believe in ourselves. That belief was there in Calcutta. If we do that we can have that competitiveness, he said.

CB Governor values book by banker
Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy highly valued the book titled Techniques of Securities for Bank Lending with an Insight to Life and Times of a Banker written by a former banker Charles Rajanathan and said present day bankers immensely need such publications to enhance their knowledge of the banking sector.
Dr Coomaraswamy made these observations during the presentation of the first copy of the book to CB Governor by author Charles Rajanathan, at Central Bank headquarters in Colombo.
While commending the contribution made by former banker Rajanathan by publishing a book in this nature, Dr Coomaraswamy thanked the author for sharing his expertise with other bankers who are engaged in the field of credit administration.
The Governor said this book will be an ideal text book for bankers especially those who are engaged in credit appraisal.
Rajanathan said the objective of publishing the book was to share his expertise in the field of various types of securities for bank lending, its operational aspects and mitigation of risk.
He said the initial chapter of the book gives an insight to the life and times of bankers of yesteryear who were not fortunate to have the luxury of technology enjoyed by the present bankers since in the past everything was done manually,
Rajanathan also told the Governor of his intention to translate this publication into Sinhala to cater to a wide audience of bankers in the rural areas.
Eminent bankers in the calibre of Chairman of Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Rajendra Theagarajah, Hatton National Bank, former Chairman/MD Rienzie Wijetilleke, Cargills Bank MD/CEO Prabhu Mathavan, Cargills Bank Director and Amana Bank former MD/CEO Faizal Salieh, HNB Director A.N. de Silva, Institute of Bankers of Sri Lanka, Director General P.J. Jayasinghe also commended this publication.
Rajanathan commenced his banking career at Hatton National Bank in 1973 and during his 30-year period he had worked in divisions which related to credit and its operation and administration.
Rajanathan was also the Head of Credit Administration at Pan Asia Bank, Union Bank of Colombo and the Amana Bank and presently he is in charge of the Training and Development arm at Cargills Bank and also a senior member of the Resource Panel of the Institute of Bankers of Sri Lanka, the Centre for Banking Studies, Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

CCB plans to increase coconut cultivation in Kurunegala
The coconut harvest of the Kurunegala District has come down by 25 percent this year when it is compared with the last years harvest (2016).
Kapila Hettiarachchi, Regional Manager of the Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB), Kurunegala revealed these facts at the recent Kurunegala District Agricultural Progress Reviewing Committee meeting held at Kurunegala District Secretariat. He said that this decline in the coconut harvest was due to the severe drought that existed recently and the fragmentation of fertile coconut lands that give good harvests in the Kurunegala District by Land Sale companies for auctioning as blocks for building houses.
Those who purchase coconut lands for selling have to get permission from the Coconut Development Board and the NWP-PC and hence, such dealings do not come under the purview of the CCB. Fragmentation of Coconut lands that give good harvests has affected very badly towards the drastic downfall of the present coconut production in the Kurunegala District, he said.
However, the CCB has planned to distribute about 250,000 coconut seedlings early next year (2018) among house holders and the school community to popularize coconut cultivation among the residents of the Kurunegala District. In addition, free manure too would be supplied to the small-scale coconut growers next year along with these free coconut seedlings next year, he added.

CFASL holds charter award ceremony
The CFA Society of Sri Lanka (CFASL) recognised 40 individuals, the highest number to date, who successfully completed the CFA program at its 2017 Charter Award Ceremony and Annual Oration held at HNB Towers.
Director and Chief Executive Office of Nations Trust Bank, Renuka Fernando was the Chief Guest and Orator at the event.
CFASL President Rachini Rajapaksa, while congratulating the new batch of charter holders and Level III passed finalists, urged them to measure up and reiterated that the duty of all society member is to live up to the CFA Institutes mission to lead the investment profession globally by promoting the highest standards of ethics, education, and professional excellence for the ultimate benefit of society.
Rachini stressed on the importance of professional excellence and ethics in the light of the ongoing investigation of financial scandals, and that it is one's own actions that will shape or destroy not only one's destiny but also the integrity of the Finance profession and the CFA designation.
Rachini advised the new batch of charterholders and passed finalists to develop a strong character that the others can be proud of and not be swayed by inappropriate influences.
The CFA Institute has processes such as an easy to use whistle blowing process coupled with a strict disciplinary process to investigate and take action against members who are found to have violated the principles of ethics and integrity. Rachini called upon all charterholders to make use of the tools provided by CFA Institute in order to report any violations and incidents.
Renuka Fernando in delivering her oration spoke on the topic of Women in Investment Management which is one of the themes currently promoted by CFA Institute. She emphasized the importance of this topic given the shortage of quality people in the financial sector and hence the need of the day is to mobilize the entire talent pool in order to meet this challenge. She underlined the seriousness of the problem by quoting a recent news article where the average board representation of the top 30 listed corporates in Sri Lanka is at a mere 10.5%.
Speaking based on her own experience in the banking sector, she identified two main reasons for this situation to arise. The first is due to a lack of confidence where this issue has been exacerbated given Sri Lankas education system which is not conducive for confidence building.
These sentiments which have been cultivated at a younger age is carried over to the workplace which stymies ones ability to advance up the corporate ladder. Given this she stated that one must make a conscious effort to overcome these mental barriers when entering the workforce.
The second reason she highlighted was the difficulties faced by professional women to balance their roles at home and in the office. She advised those who are just starting on their professional careers to come to the realization that you simply cannot be super mum and super career woman at the same time, every day, 24 hours of the day. While there were no easy solutions to this, she nevertheless stressed that it is doable if you are determined and not afraid to step up to a challenge.

Picking the right players who can perform under pressure
Change room has players who keep repeating the same mistakes  Pothas
Monday: Nic Pothas may not have great credentials as a cricket coach but when it comes to brass tacks he is certainly no stranger.
Following Sri Lankas heaviest Test defeat by an innings and 239 runs at the hands of India here today, Pothas in a no holds barred press conference said Sri Lanka needs to pick the right players who can perform under pressure and get rid of those who keep on making the same mistakes.
When things get tough some people fall off the bus some get better. The key is to make sure we are picking people or more people that are likely to stay on the bus when the pressure goes up, that is the nature of professional sport, said Pothas.
Cricket is a game of chess and when you play a team like India if one team makes a move, you better have a counter move. If you dont, you will fall off that bus. At the moment we got a few in our change room who keep making the same move and losing pieces off the chess board.
You can talk all you want to and you can plan a lot but at the end of the day youve got to execute your plans in the middle. As a player your currency is runs, wickets and catches you can do all you like but if you are not producing them obviously there will be repercussions. Thats the world of professional sport, he said.
Suffering the heaviest defeat is hugely disappointing because of the amount of work ethics that goes in behind the scenes. It is embarrassing the players should be embarrassed by their own performances. Practicing at the nets means nothing, if you do not go out and put runs on the board.
Pothas pointed out the percentage of boundaries Sri Lanka hit in their second innings was amazingly high in comparison to India when they compiled up their massive total of 610-6 declared.
When the percentage of your score is so high in boundaries against a high quality attack you are going to get into a lot of trouble. India for example in their score of 610 their boundary percentage was 37, thats how they got their runs. We are talking about the top batters in the world. If 37 percent is good enough for them then it surely should be good enough for us, said Pothas.
Replying to a question on whether it was a wise choice to play the number one ranked team India in back to back series, Pothas said, I firmly believe that if you play a team like India in such a short space of time twice 6 Test matches, the guys with the right characters which I keep talking about and keep asking for will get better into the future. As long as the curve is in a general upward trend and when you look down the line that persons going to get better.
Its tough, the answer you will probably get 18 months to 2 years whether this was a good idea or not to play India twice. Personally as a coach I find it hugely exciting, Ive learnt a lot in the last series and in the short time weve been here and continue to learn more.
Pothas believed that four-day domestic cricket for Sri Lanka is a must to address the current trend of dismal batting displays in Test cricket.
Playing three-day cricket is a huge contributing factor. If we have a format that gives you opportunity to bat 4-6 hours its unfair on our part to ask batters to come and try replicate that in a Test match against high quality bowling, said Pothas.
That is being addressed. Kumar (Sangakkara) and Mahela (Jayawardene) have spoken about that at length and it is being heeded. Once we get into a 4-day format of high quality cricket it will actually make it easier to select people based on results rather than any other factors.

Cinnamon Life Business Forum series kicks off with Andreas Krger
Cinnamon Life, Sri Lankas largest and most iconic integrated multi-functional development project to date, in association with Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and German Development Cooperation (GIZ), hosted the first chapter of the Cinnamon Life Forum series yesterday. Leading the first event in the highly-anticipated thought leadership series will be world renowned property policy expert and Managing Partner of Belius GmbH, Berlin  Andreas Krger, who explored the pertinent topic of creative placemaking and entrepreneurship in the 21st century.
The Cinnamon Life Business Forum series was launched to share powerful ideas that will ultimately help to shape Colombo into a dynamic and competitive city. By exploring the subject of modern day placemaking and entrepreneurship, Krger tackled a wide array of important areas, including political, government and public administration policymaking, understanding of roles, stakeholder monitoring and provided an overview of recommended methods and process innovation.
He also touched on smart participation and collaboration formats, economic and financial feasibility, as well as the need to embrace a respectful, transparent and accessible culture of dialogue, communications and marketing.
The first segment of the forum addressed the key questions in the field of innovative placemaking and entrepreneurship in modern times, whilst empowering Sri Lankas top business audiences to conceptualize thoughtful frameworks and resources to power physical, digital and financial platforms.
In addition, Krger also delivered exclusive insights from the drastic transformation of Berlin, a dynamic and fast-paced city that thrives on entrepreneurial drive, contrast and creativity. These valuable insights, coupled with useful learnings from some of Krgers projects such as Moritzplatz and Prinzessinnengrten, will collectively shed light on the important role that citizens and residents play in the development of a city and its governance, whilst fostering the understanding of behavioral changes that are required to keep a city constantly evolving and transforming.
Raised in north Germany and currently based in Berlin, Andreas Krger is a multidisciplinary expert with decades of experience in the fields of creative placemaking, content related space strategies, urban humanity, artist interventions and cultural and creative working processes. He also has in-depth knowledge of the areas of international exchanges, urban development, urban planning, property policy, construction and real estate, among others. Krger currently serves at the helm of Belius, a Berlin based strategic consultancy, which supports policymakers, urban administrations, property owners and investors, users as well as civic initiatives. His team helps them in their efforts to create and maintain human centered, livable, relevant and economically feasible spaces. Additionally, Krger specializes in curating urban residences and developments for cultural, retail and commercial as well as residential use.
Commenting on spearheading the first event of the Cinnamon Life Forum series, Krger, Managing Partner of Belius GmbH, Berlin, stated: I am pleased to have been invited to participate at the Cinnamon Life Business Forum series and kickstart this innovative initiative, that will help to reshape the city of Colombo. Though Sri Lanka has evolved steadily and progressed rapidly since the end of the civil conflict, the country has yet to see a mixed development as large as Cinnamon Life making a mark on its skyline and economy. I hope that these talks will showcase the role that this project and the countrys rapidly growing real estate industry at large, will play in the development and positioning of the city of Colombo both regionally and internationally.
Cinnamon Life is a mixed development by Sri Lankas premier listed conglomerate, the John Keells Group. Upon completion, the project will comprise an 800-roomed luxury Cinnamon Hotel, an array of entertainment facilities, apartments, retail and entertainment malls, office spaces, and many other attractions.
The developments iconic design by Cecil Balmond will span across 4.5 million square feet, and it envisioned to be the epicentre of modern South Asia. Designed to be the first multi-functional development of its kind in the country, and a city within a city, Cinnamon Life is set to strengthen Colombos position as a travel, trade, lifestyle and entertainment hotspot in the Indian Subcontinent.

Protecting Sangha Order
Former Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has given the statistics of Buddhist monks who have alleged to have committed sexual abuse, artifact thefts, financial fraud, child abuse, rape, property theft. He also makes mention of monks remanded for disturbing the duty of the Court and also a prominent Buddhist monk possessing an elephant without a valid permit. He has not touched on monks who have distributed Sil Redi, perhaps they have not been charged. To a question raised in parliament by Minister, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka sometimes back, Dr Rajapakshe had tried to safeguard this errant monk.
Whatever it be, the Sangha stands accused of crimes which reflects badly on the religion  Buddhism, which the Noble Teacher Buddha, Siddharta Gauthama preached. Whoever tries to break the Sangha should first think of cleansing the Sangha of these men in yellow robes and bring discipline and that is how a breakup of the Sangha could be done for its betterment.
