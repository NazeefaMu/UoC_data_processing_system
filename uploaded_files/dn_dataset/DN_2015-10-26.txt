Afghan Malala speaks up for refugee children
AFGHANISTAN: At the age of just 14, Afghan rights activist Aziza Rahimzada has already surmounted legal hurdles preventing 25,000 refugee children from attending school, and cajoled authorities into providing tap water to a camp housing more than 100 families.
Now she has been nominated for the International Children's Peace Prize -- an award previously won by Malala Yousafzai -- and, like her Pakistani counterpart, hopes to spread her message of universal education and fundamental rights for Afghanistan's youth.
These children are the products of war, Aziza says during an interview with AFP from the Kabul camp for internally displaced people where she was born after her family fled fighting in the Parwan province in 2001.
They have suffered a lot during the war years. I give them advice and council them on the value of education, she says in Dari, wearing a black-and-white headscarf as she sits on the floor of the tiny mud brick home that houses her family of eight.
Their families are also uneducated so sometimes we have to convince them too.
It is a thin line to walk, both for someone so young and without stirring a backlash in a conservative society unused to children, particularly girls, speaking up for themselves.
Aziza's confidence impressed the Mobile Mini Circus for Children (MMCC), an international humanitarian group founded by Danes Berit Muhlhausen and David Mason, who moved to Afghanistan shortly after the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001.
The group works throughout Afghanistan with a local partner and aims to bring children together through play, while identifying young leaders who can represent the needs of their communities.
In a country ravaged by decades of war, where more than 60 percent of the population are under 25, those needs are great.
She was very special from the beginning. She was thinking more than the others, advocating for others, asking questions. Gradually she became a representative for the other children, said Mason.
In shuras (consultative councils) organised by the group, Aziza quickly identified pressing issues faced by the 500 or so children in her camp, and others like it in Kabul.
Foremost among these was the lack of running water, which meant children were sent far away to fetch heavy pails of waters for the family -- until Aziza intervened, securing a pipe that pumps water into the camp and serves 144 families.
Another key issue was education. As children of refugees born into abject poverty, those in the camps lacked the necessary documentation for admission into the capital city's schools, with Kabul authorities viewing the internally displaced people as temporary migrants who would eventually return to their home districts.
Helped by the MMCC, Aziza led the children in lobbying local officials and then parliament, with the aid of some high-profile lawmakers like women's rights activist Fawzia Koofi.
Her persistence eventually led to a breakthrough allowing some 25,000 children living in Kabul's 59 refugee camps to register in the capital, making them eligible to attend school.
This was an achievement of astronomic scale. I saw those kids in school uniform, and I couldn't recognise them. It was such a relief to see them -- it was such a radical transformation, said Mason, the MMCC director.
Aziza's unique talent, Mason's partner Muhlhausen argues, lies not only in her gifted rhetoric, but in her ability to forcefully advocate for her fellow children without stirring controversy.
She is among the final three nominees for the award along with Abraham Keita, 17, from Liberia and Jeanesha Bou, also 17, of Puerto Rico, with the winner announced in the Hague on November 9.
But the teenager, who says she wants to found her country's first Ombudsman's office to redress her fellow citizen's grievances, says her work is far from complete.
What I have achieved so far is nothing, she says, emphasising that as time goes on, her country will have to stand on its own feet.
The foreign NGOs will one day stop their aid. That's why we need to strengthen our own institutions and improve social justice for our people, she said.

Australia marks 30 years since Uluru returned to Aboriginal owners
AUSTRALIA: Australia Monday marked 30 years since the worlds largest monolith Uluru was returned to its traditional Aboriginal owners with the government admitting it has not lived up to commitments made back then.
The iconic symbol of the Outback, also known as Ayers Rock, was handed back to the Anangu people, the areas original inhabitants who have lived in the area for thousands of years, on October 26, 1985.
As part of the agreement, the government signed a 99-year lease to jointly manage the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park with the traditional custodians. More jobs and better living standards were expected to flow to the Anangu from the deal. But Indigenous Affairs Minister Nigel Scullion said it had not always gone as planned.
The implicit part of the agreement is that Anangu people do better because of the things that would come here; they would have jobs, they would have a better life, they would have more choices, he told reporters.
The deal isnt complete, those opportunities have never been provided in the way they should have been. We need to make that change and we need to make that now.
He said 254 of the 450 Anangu community members in the area were out of work, despite the fact the Ayers Rock Resort, 20 minutes away, welcomed 300,000 visitors a year.
We cant accept that theres 254 people in Mutitjulu on the dole, Scullion said.
We cant just accept glibly pretty low inter-generational levels of literacy and numeracy. We cant simply look at that and say its OK.
This should be a reminder to us all to refocus our efforts (across Australia).
Uluru, a giant red rock that rises 348 metres (1,148 feet) above the desert, is surrounded by thousands of square kilometres of desolate Outback and forms a key part of Aboriginal creation mythology. It is also a World Heritage site.
While artist Malya Teamay told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation he was pleased with the way tourists were learning about Aboriginal culture, others said the Anangu people seemed to be missing out on much of the economic activity.
Sammy Wilson, chairman of the board of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, criticised the government for directing much of its funding to the Ayers Rock Resort, which he said had become the focus of tourism and not the local people.
It seems like a big vacuum cleaner is sucking everything away, Wilson said.
This place (Uluru) is our culture here, but it (the funding) is ending up over there (at the resort); it should be here.

Battle of Stalingrad, the turning point of the Second World War
Between August of 1942 and January of 1943 an epic battle was waged in the Soviet city of Stalingrad, which according to many commentators determined the course of the Second World War and thereby the path of history. Had the Germans taken the city early, many things now we take for granted may have evolved very differently.
Having swept across the endless Russian plains with relative ease, the German armies did not anticipate great difficulties in taking the city. Stalingrad was not initially a strategic imperative, in the German plans it was only to be an interim stop on their way to destroying the Soviet State. On the other hand, for the beleaguered Russian troops, having retreated all summer under terrible conditions, to forego the city that bore the name of Stalin was no option. Less hopefully, but with a quiet determination, they had decided that they would retreat no more. The soldiers of the Red army fighting to defend the city on the Volga will either hold their ground or perish in the process. As things turned out, there was a lot more staked on the ensuing battle for Stalingrad than the mere fate of a large city.
1941
As the surprise Soviet counter-offensive of the winter of 1941 petered out in the freezing snows of the Russian wilderness the minds of the German war planners began to turn to the inevitable summer campaign ahead, their successive offensive against a bloodied but defiant enemy.
Adolf Hitler (centre), Hermann Goering and General Field Marshall Wilhelm Keitel.
Six months before, on the 22nd of June 1941 the awesome and seemingly unstoppable German war machine had launched itself at Russia, the largest country in the world, with a sudden and devastating ferocity. For this unprecedented attack the Germans had divided their 4 million strong striking force into three large army groups. Army Group North was to dash up to Leningrad, while bringing the Baltic area under its heel. The task of the exceptionally strong Army Group Centre was to thrust in to the Russia heartland with Moscow as the desired long stop. The Donets River was the ambitious summer target for the Army Group South with the Ukraine and Crimea as the rich prizes.
Only from an army in the class of the Wehrmacht could a task of such scale and ambition be demanded. No army in history had to conquer a land as vast and an enemy as formidable in just one furious campaign. To even contemplate such an undertaking the attacker had to possess outstanding soldiery and a capacity for extraordinary efficiency. Germany was obviously blessed with both.
The war opened dazzlingly for the Teutonic warriors. Punching huge gaps in the bewildered enemy defense lines the formidable Panzer divisions of the Germans streaked across the Russian plains leaving the mopping up to the slower infantry divisions. These highly trained men of the infantry, while continuously fighting the retreating Russians marched a regular 30 miles a day, determined to keep cohesion with their comrades in the fast moving armoured units relentlessly moving ahead.
But the country, that Germany had now locked horns with was immense, and the enemy exceedingly tough. It is testimony to the superlative caliber of German arms that they, hopelessly over-stretched after six months of continuous fighting, almost achieved victory. In the north they surrounded Leningrad and imposed a crippling siege on the city. In the centre, German reconnaissance units stomped through knee high snow to the outskirts of Moscow. In the south most of Ukraine was theirs.
The Russian bear was dreadfully mauled, but was refusing to lie down.
In the huge gamble the Germans had taken, even a near victory amounted to a strategic defeat. Although the Germans were now deep in Russia, given the size of the country and the endless supply of men and material Russia could command, it was still in a position to continue resisting strongly.
The Russian bear was dreadfully mauled, but was refusing to lie down.
In the huge gamble the Germans had taken, even a near victory amounted to a strategic defeat. Although the Germans were now deep in Russia, given the size of the country and the endless supply of men and material Russia could command, it was still in a position to continue resisting strongly. The fundamental failure of the Wehrmacht to achieve a decisive win in 1941 now necessitated a renewed offensive in 1942 to bring the enemy to heel, once and for all.
But after the dreadful winter battles of 1941, when Russians launched quite an effective counter punch, Germans were not in a position to renew their attack on all three fronts. After much consideration they picked on the economically vital Southern Front, with the hope that their superior military could administer such a crippling blow to the Russians that they would be compelled to surrender. The Army Groups North and Centre were to remain on a defensive posture with a few local offensives to keep the Russian defenders in those fronts pinned down.
1942
For the gigantic attack of 1942 the Army Group South was reorganized with Field Marshall Von Bock in overall charge. Under his command were several armies including the 2nd army, 17th army, the 6th army, the 1st Panzer army and the 4th Panzer army. Each of these armies was capable of delivering a crippling blow to the enemy while the 6th was particularly strong with 11 divisions and an entire Panzer Corps in its establishment.
Operation Blue, as the plan was named, was somewhat vague on its final objectives, but envisaged reaching the Volga in the East, bringing the large city of Stalingrad under control while reaching the Eastern Caucasus during the campaign. Again it was hoped that by menacing this vital area they could compel the Soviets to commit its precious reserves thus presenting the Germans with an opportunity to force the issue.
The Germans had no doubts about the superiority of their fighting men. Repeatedly, they had observed the clumsy battle tactics and the wooden orthodoxy of the Russian commanders. In contrast the Germans were trained and encouraged to fight unconventionally and resourcefully. Rather than attempting to overwhelm the enemy with mere numbers and often wasteful firepower, the Wehrmacht embraced the idea of paralyzing their foe with speed and effectiveness.
On 28th of June 1942 Von Bock opened his offensive with predictable ferocity, within days splitting the Russian front in to rapidly disintegrating fragments. Once again the vaunted armoured divisions of the Germans advanced East across the massive steppe seeking an opportunity to mortally wound the enemy. Not only were they assured of their military supremacy, the Germans were also convinced of their racial superiority over an enemy whom their internal military magazines routinely described in terms such as- degenerate looking Orientals, begging whining Asians, a mixture of low and the lowest humanity, truly subhuman.
By the 22nd of August elements of the German 6th Army, now under the command of General Friedrich Paulus, had reached the Volga, in the borders of the Asian continent, a remarkable advance since June of 1941. Stalingrad, the city carrying the name of the Soviet dictator was tantalizingly within grasp.
The next day, 23rd of August with predictable efficiency the German Air Force began carpet-bombing the ill-fated city. The resulting fires turned Stalingrad in to a burning inferno of collapsed buildings, rubble and thick smoke. No human force could resist the German firepower in those conditions. Hitler who had baulked at the idea of committing his troops to city fighting in Moscow and Leningrad the previous year, now decided that he must have Stalingrad. Perhaps less sanguinely, but certainly with grim determination, Stalin had also decided that Russia would not retreat any further.
Russian defenders
So began the titanic struggle between these two implacable enemies for a burnt out patch of the earth, which finally became the turning point of the Second World War. For the valiant Russian defenders there was little choice. They faced the fury of the German guns well aware that retreat only meant drowning in the freezing waters of the Volga. Besides, Joseph Stalin who knew how to impose his will had placed Secret Service Police detachments in the rear with strict orders to summarily execute any Russian soldier disobeying the order to hold his ground.
For the Germans, the battle for Stalingrad turned their world up side down. Their armoured divisions trained to capture something like 50 miles a day, were now advancing at snail pace, and attempting to subdue a burning city against an enemy who rarely showed himself. One single building would change hands several times in a day, each battle only adding to the corpses lying on the floor. In such close quarter fighting German planes and tanks were unable to join effectively through the fear of hitting their own.
A German Lieutenant with the 24th Panzer division described the battlefield thus Stalingrad is no longer a city. By day it is an enormous cloud of burning, blinding smoke; it is a vast furnace lit by the reflection of the flames. And when the nights arrive, one of those scorching, howling, bleeding nights, the dogs plunge in to the Volga and swim desperately to gain the other bank. The nights of Stalingrad are a terror for them. Animals flee this hell; the hardest stones cannot bear it for any longer; only men endure.
While the climacteric battle was raging in this man made hell-hole of a burning city hundreds of powerful German divisions were holding their impossibly long front line from the Baltic Sea to the Caucasus Mountains, many almost on an R & R mode. General Paulus himself could only commit eight of the divisions of the 6th Army to the crucial battle in the city while assigning eleven divisions under his command to guard the large area under the Armys administration and his almost 200 mile long exposed flanks.
As the battle dragged on in to the Russian winter many a General warned of the dangers inherent in a prestige battle, where the German army was paying a price totally out of proportion to the citys fast diminishing strategic importance. But the majority of the high command including Hitler, who held the Russians in contempt, could not conceive of a large-scale counteroffensive by them. The Wehrmacht, which had traditionally prided itself on its cold rationality, was now acting increasingly on hateful prejudices, arrogance and unwarranted optimism. So General Paulus, the harried commander of the 6th Army who was considered a competent staff office, if slow-witted and unimaginative in the field, continued with tactics designed to grind down the enemy inch by inch, an approach which was essentially counter-productive to the numerically weaker but technically superior Germans.
Second World War
The German battle order in the Stalingrad area now presented Marshall Zhukov the Russian Commander, legendary for his coolness under pressure, with a situation where he could turn tables on the enemy. The German 6th Army intent on gaining Stalingrad at any cost was fully absorbed in city fighting. Its long and difficult flanks guarded mainly by satellite divisions from Rumania and Hungary with a sprinkling of German units, were vulnerable. These satellite armies were far inferior to the Germans in equipment as well as in fighting qualities. The nearest German formations of any size were far away in the Caucasus absorbed in heavy fighting in that mountain region.
Realizing the opportunity the situation presented, Zhukov decided to keep the battle of Stalingrad going even at a heavy price while secretly accumulating huge forces at the extremities of the German flanks. It was a hard decision.
The men he ferried across the Volga to battle the Germans in the inferno of Stalingrad had extremely low chances of returning alive. But in order to keep the Germans firmly focused on the city, Zhukov was willing to pay with blood for time. For almost four months the two armies waged a ferocious battle for the few remaining square miles of the city of Stalingrad.
Then in the early hours of the 19th of November 1942, when the freezing winter of Russia was well advanced, Zhukov struck. The Russians, in two huge pincer attacks, pierced the flanks of the 6th Army and moved rapidly towards the town of kalach their intended meeting point.
On their advance the Russians met only feeble resistance from the Rumanians and the Hungarians, the satellite troops, to whom the Germans had entrusted the task of guarding the rear of the 6th Army. When the two pincer arms of the Russians met at Kalach on the 22nd of November they had entrapped the great 6th Army of the Germans. In the bleak icy Russian Steppe, covered by a numbing winter mist, the turning point of the Second World War had been reached.
Although the Germans were to fight on doggedly for another two and half years, they had lost the initiative. From then on they were largely an Army in defense.

Chinas richest man doubled fortune in 12 months: Forbes
CHINA: Chinas richest man saw his fortune balloon by nearly $17 billion -- a sum larger than the GDP of Iceland -- in the past year, business magazine Forbes said Monday.
Wang Jianlin, founder of real estate and entertainment conglomerate Wanda Group, saw his wealth rocket from $13.2 billion to $30 billion in the publishers 2015 China Rich List.
The windfall, which came despite sluggish growth in the worlds second-largest economy, was driven by the flotations of two of his companys subsidiaries.
Market forces and creative abilities were crucial to building major businesses in China, Wang said, rather than personal connections.
Its good to have money, he said in a brief appearance at the announcement of the ranking. The majority of people with money, especially extraordinarily rich people, are good people.
At his average rate of accumulation last year he would have become more than $200,000 wealthier during his seven minutes on the stage.
Wang Jianlin is known outside China for a string of overseas acquisitions including the organiser of Ironman extreme endurance contests, Swiss sports marketing group Infront, and a stake in Spanish football club Atletico Madrid.
He burst into the spotlight in 2012 by buying US cinema chain AMC Entertainment for $2.6 billion.
Wang leapt from fourth to first in the Forbes list, one of several charting Chinas most affluent people.
He unseated Jack Ma, founder of tech giant Alibaba, who dropped to second place on $21.8 billion as his firms share price slumped in New York.
The 100 richest people in China were worth $450 billion, Forbes said, up nearly 20 percent in a year -- far faster than current GDP growth of 6.9 percent and despite a rout on Chinese stock markets.
Six out of ten of Chinas richest were in the technology sector, including Ma Huateng of Internet titan Tencent (third), Lei Jun of Xiaomi (fourth), and Robin Li of Chinese search engine Baidu, who slipped four spots this year from second to sixth.
Chinas economy is going through a period of structural change, said Forbes senior editor and list compiler Russell Flannery, adding that the richest had found new opportunities tied to that transition.

FR against President for appointing over 30 ministers
A fundamental rights petition filed by a lawyer challenging President Maithripala Sirisenas decision to increase the number of Cabinet ministers from 30 to 48 was yesterday fixed to be mentioned on November 17 by the Supreme Court. This petition had been filed by attorney-at-law Aruna Laksiri. He has cited President Sirisena and the Attorney General as respondents.
When the petition came up before Supreme Court Justices Upaly Aberatne and Anil Goonaratne, Deputy Solicitor General Indika Demuni de Silva with Dr. Awanthi Perera appearing for the first and second respondents informed Court that they were raising preliminary objections against the petition.
The petitioner has stated that according to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, a National Government should comprise the party that has obtained the highest number of seats and the other parties and independent groups in Parliament. The petitioner maintains that the present government could not be described as a National Government merely because a couple of parties entered into an agreement to form a government, and, therefore, it is a gross violation of Article 46.1 (a) of the Constitution. The petitioner is seeking interim relief preventing the President from appointing more than 30 ministers.

A gem in Katubedda
September 13, 1955 was a red letter day for the countrys higher education. It was also a memorable day for people living in an around Molpe and Katubedde in the Moratuwa electorate. During this period, the Prime Minister of then Ceylon was Sir John Kothalawala who laid the foundation stone for a Technical College at Katubedda, Moratuwa.
The Canadian government donated two projects to the Ceylon government in the early 50s. They were a hospital and a technical college. S. de S. Jayasinghe was the Member of Parliament for Dehiwala - Mt. Lavinia. He was also a minister of the Kothalawala Cabinet.
As there was a technical college at Dehiwala, Jayasinghe requested the Prime Minister that he be given the hospital project.
On the 13th day of 1955 afternoon Sir John arrived to the present Katubedda Campus premises to lay the foundation stone. He laid the foundation stone with the participation of a large gathering.
In 1959, the donor of this project Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker and the Prime Minister of Ceylon S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike were scheduled to open the Technical College. However, instead of Prime Minister Bandaranaike, Education Minister W. Dhanayake participated.
In 1957, it was named as the Institute of Practical Technology. Those who could not enter the university in engineering were allowed to follow a four year Diploma Certificate Course.
In 1972, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike on a request by Moratuwa MP and Lanka Sama Samaja Party stalwart and later General Secretary Wimalasiri de Mel, elevated it to a university.
The engineering degree commenced and the JTO course was made NDT. During the last five and a half decades, the University of Moratuwa has produced men of calibre who are scattered all over the world.

Graduate association helps remote school
Nagalawewa primary school in Dambulla is an underprivileged school with bare minimum necessities.
About 67 students attend the school and the authorities have paid scant attention to its pressing problems. Against all odds Principal Jayarathna Suriyagoda and his staff are dedicated to develop the school. Meanwhile several volunteer organizations had provided many facilities to the school.
One such organisation - Central Provincial Branch of Colombo University Old Graduate Association - offered school equipment including uniforms for the children at a ceremony held recently at the school.
Biyagama North Lions Club had donated musical instruments for the school band group at the occasion.The principal said, many well-wishers and philanthropists had made valuable donations earlier to develop the school. The service rendered by the Central Provincial Branch of Colombo University Old Graduate Association and Biyagama North Lions Club are commendable acts as the school was in dire need of the items received. In future, I expect further assistance to improve this school, he added.
The chairman of the old graduate association H. R. Senavirathna, secretary K. W. G. Weerasingha, the members of the association and Biyagama North Lions Club President Luksiri Paranamana also attended.
School staff in collaboration with the villagers offered a lunch for the participants.

Dr. Senanayake said children in 50 percent of families undergo domestic violence and are beaten up.
Children who become victims of domestic violence develop stammering and urinate in bed at night. They also face panic attacks often. Female children who face domestic violence get used to tolerate it and think it is normal while the boys learn to use domestic violence as a tool of control once they grow up, he said.
"A majority of female schoolchildren face harassment while waiting for buses. A national level action plan is in the offing to ensure the safety of women and children.The Media Ministry will contribute towards this plan immensely," Dr. Senanayake said.
Consultant Community Physician Dr. Sanjeewa Godakandage said a study revealed that 77 percent of Sri Lankan women in the reproductive age need a family planning method because they are at risk of getting pregnant and around 90 percent of Sri Lankan women expect only two children.
"Still 7.1 percent of Sri Lankan women do not use a proper family planning method," he said.

S.A. Wijayatilake
Illustrious Principal of Ananda College
S.A. Wijayatilake is recognised as an illustrious Principal of Ananda College, Colombo. His views and suggestions expressed without fear and favour were generally accepted by all heads.
Samarapulige Ariyaratne Wijeyatilake was born on December 22, 1901 at Matale. He was the fifth in a family of nine siblings, born to S.M.P. Wijeyatilake and Leela Wijayatilake nee Gunasekera.
Young SA started his primary education at the Buddhist Institute (Now Wijaya College), Matale. He completed his primary schooling at Christ Church in Matale. Thereafter he was admitted to St. Johns College, Panadura. He joined Ananda at Grade seven. After completing his secondary education he entered the Ceylon University College, reading English, History and Western Classics for a B.A. degree from the University of London which he obtained in 1921.
S.A. joined the staff of Dharmaraja College, Kandy, as a teacher to which profession he devoted his life.
After about two years at Dharmaraja he joined the staff of Ananda College where P.de S. Kularatne was the Principal. In 1924, Kularatne inaugurated Nalanda Vidyalaya and transferred some of the most versatile and dedicated teachers from Ananda to the new institute. They were C.E. Strange, S.A. Wijeyatilake, J.N.Jinendradasa, V.I. Perera, D.C. Lawris, and C.E.P. Kumarasinghe (father of the writer). G.P. Malalasekera was appointed Principal of Nalanda.

Indo-Lanka Naval Exercise from October 27
The Sri Lanka Navy and the Indian Navy Joint Naval Exercise (SLINEX) is scheduled to be held from October 27 to November 1 in the seas off Trincomalee.
Six naval ships and six Fast Attack Craft of Sri Lanka Navy and three ships of the Indian Navy will take part in the joint training this year.
This exercise paves the way for operational effectiveness through common understanding of neighbouring Navies. Moreover, it concerns on maintaining effective maritime security in the region by integrating forces through cooperation, coordination and collaboration. This leads to mutual understanding of limitations and capabilities, to enhance service interoperability and system compatibility in countering challenges.
It is a great opportunity for both the Navies to rehearse and improve capabilities such as cross deck operations, replenishment at sea and information sharing. Furthermore, they will also carry out coordinated helicopter operations at sea during the exercise.
Indian Navy has been a great mentor of Sri Lanka Navy in many maritime aspects.
Regular joint exercises have facilitated both the navies to gradually and systematically develop professionalism through these interactions.

Jackson to be quizzed
Popular artiste Jackson Anthony is likely to be summoned before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) to obtain a statement regarding excessive finances incurred on the opening dance acts performed at the Hambantota harbour opening, sources said. Anthony was the creative director for the ceremony held in 2010. Rs. 15 million was spent for the dance acts alone, which was performed by members of the Channa-Upuli Dance Academy managed by dancers Channa Wijewardena and Upuli Panibharatha.
The duo in a statement to PRECIFAC last week stated that only Rs. 6.8 million was paid to them.
Meanwhile, Jackson Anthony yesterday said on being contacted and asked by the Daily News about his involvement in the harbours water filling ceremony on August 15, 2010,  I was the Creative Director of that ceremony. As the creative director of the event I gave the concept to Channa Wijewardena. Asked if he had been called to appear before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, Anthony said, I saw that some social network websites had reported that I have been summoned by the Commission.
I have not received anything to this effect though. I do not know anything about this, he said. Asked if he was aware that artistes Channa Wijewardena and Upuli Panibharatha had given statements regarding payments they have received for their performances at the Habanthota Harbour ceremony, Anthony said, Yes, Channa told me so.
Commenting on the situation Channa Wijewardena told the Daily News, at the request of the Ports Authority, their Arts Foundation agreed to stage multiple dance events at the Hmbnathota harbour water filling ceremony. It was Jackson that gave the concept to us , he said. We were asked to present a group of 1,000 dancers for the show. I told them that the costs would be exorbitant with so many artistes. Then they asked me to come up with 500 artistes, I further reduced the number down to 200.
We did not accept any cash. The payments were made through banking. I have submitted every slip and file to the Presidential Commission, he said.
I want the authorities to go ahead and investigate every one of my bank accounts, he said.  This is really saddening, I am an artiste who has brought international recognition to Sri Lanka, not just once, but, seven or more occasions.
I have earned many international accolades and awards for Sri Lanka, competing with 99 countries,said Wijewardena. And they are asking me if I had had taken an amount that I was not even aware of for a show that I gave with all my heart in terms of its artistic value, he pointed out.
Should anyone wonder as to for what we charged the sum of Rs 6,888,125, it is for payments for 200 dancers who performed at the ceremony, together with 200 costumes that were made, stage equipment, the two month training that was given to them, the services of professional make-up artistes and hair dressers, sounds that were purchased, food and lodgings given to artistes and other miscellaneous expenses, he said.
Moreover, he said,  as a matter of policy, we do not charge any money for costs involving creating costumes and graphics when a show is a state event. We did not charge for any of these events as well.

Jimmy Morales, from comedian to Guatemalan President
GUATEMALA: Guatemalan comedian Jimmy Morales entry into politics started out sounding like a joke, but he is now laughing all the way to the presidential palace after a massive corruption scandal upended the election.
Morales, a comic actor and TV personality with no political experience, had just 0.5 percent support in April, at the beginning of his presidential campaign.
But the conservative candidate won a landslide victory in a run-off election Sunday.
Morales rode a wave of disgust among ordinary Guatemalans, who deserted the traditional political elite in outrage over a series of corruption scandals that culminated in the resignation and jailing of president Otto Perez just days before the first-round vote. In a climate of widespread disdain for politics as usual, Morales total lack of political experience was seen as a plus.
He declared victory Sunday night, thanking Guatemalans for giving him a mandate... to fight the corruption that has consumed us.
My commitment remains to God and the Guatemalan people, and I will work with all my heart and strength not to defraud you, he said.
His opponent, former first lady Sandra Torres, conceded defeat and wished him success. Morales, 46, is famous for his 2007 film A President in a Sombrero, in which he plays a country bumpkin cowboy named Neto who nearly gets elected president by accident.
Neto surges in the polls by making a string of empty promises on the campaign trail, but ends up dropping out of the race and returning to his hometown.

Missing Persons Commission to probe White Flag case
An investigation team of the Commission will be conducting an independent, impartial inquiry into the alleged extra-judicial executions of surrendering top level members of the LTTE during the last stages of the conflict, Presidential Commission Investigating Cases of Missing Persons chairman P. Paranagama said.
Paranagama told the Daily News that the investigation arm of the Commission will conduct a thorough investigation into these allegations, after gathering evidence from parties concerned and taking to account present evidence in hand.
When inquired if evidence provided by Channel 4 or other interested parties will be considered, he added that all details will be deliberated and examined by the team that investigates.
A five member team including a retired High Court Judge will examine these allegations and even visit several districts to gather information before submitting the report. The report is scheduled to be submitted early next year, most probably by February.
The now infamous White Flag Killing aired under the same name by Channel 4 which alleged that top level members of the LTTE including Head of its Political Wing Balasingham Nadesan, Seevaratnam Pulidevan, the LTTEs Head of the Peace Secretariat and several other high ranking LTTE members had been given assurances through NGOs and other intermediaries regarding being able to surrender to the armed forces who had surrounded them. However, those who had proceeded to do so upon the instructions of the intermediaries had allegedly been shot and killed by government forces.
However, the former Army Commander Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka previously stated that he was not informed regarding any communications during the final stages of the war regarding any LTTE members wanting to surrender, and that if any took place he was not informed at that time.
The previous government headed by then President Mahinda Rajapaksa and then Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa have vehemently denied this stating that the government forces never killed anyone who surrendered to the armed forces, including during the last days of the conflict.
The team investigating the alleged White Flag incident, will further fan out to cover alleged shelling by armed forces in the later stages, the alleged killing of Isaipriya who worked as a broadcaster for LTTEs Oliveechchu television station which operated from Kilinochchi.
According to Channel 4 footage Isaipriya was captured and later executed by the armed forces.
The Paranagam Commission was appointed by former President Rajapaksa to probe complaints regarding missing persons in the Northern and Eastern Provinces from June 10, 1990 to May 19, 2009.
Earlier, Paranagama submitted the Report to President Maithripala Sirisena. It was later tabled in Parliament on October 20 by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The report mainly looked into violation of International Humanitarian Law or War Crimes allegedly committed both the government forces and the LTTE and how to prevent such occurrences in the future.

New drugs that may cure baldness found
US: In some good news for people with receding hairlines, scientists have identified new drugs that could stimulate rapid and robust hair growth, offering a potential cure for baldness.
The drugs inhibit a family of enzymes inside hair follicles that are suspended in a resting state, restoring hair growth, researchers said.
In experiments with mouse and human hair follicles, Angela M Christiano from Columbia University Medical Center and colleagues found that drugs that inhibit the Janus kinase (JAK) family of enzymes promote rapid and robust hair growth when directly applied to the skin.
The study raises the possibility that drugs known as JAK inhibitors could be used to restore hair growth in multiple forms of hair loss such as that induced by male pattern baldness, and additional types that occur when hair follicles are trapped in a resting state, researchers said.
Two JAK inhibitors have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). One is approved for treatment of blood diseases (ruxolitinib) and the other for rheumatoid arthritis (tofacitinib).
Both are being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss. What we've found is promising, though we haven't yet shown it is effective for male pattern baldness, said Christiano.
More work needs to be done to test formulations of JAK inhibitors specially made for the scalp to determine whether they can induce hair growth in humans, she said.
Christiano and her colleagues serendipitously discovered the effect of JAK inhibitors on hair follicles when they were studying a type of hair loss known as alopecia areata, caused by an autoimmune attack on the hair follicles.
They reported last year that JAK inhibitors shut off the signal that provokes the autoimmune attack, and that oral forms of the drug restore hair growth in some people with the disorder.
In the course those experiments, Christiano noticed that mice grew more hair when the drug was applied topically to the skin than when given internally. This suggested JAK inhibitors might have a direct effect on the hair follicles in addition to inhibiting the immune attack.
When the researchers looked more closely at normal mouse hair follicles, they found that JAK inhibitors rapidly awakened resting follicles out of dormancy. Hair follicles do not produce hair constantly but rather by cycling between resting and growing phases.
JAK inhibitors trigger the follicles normal reawakening process, the researchers found. Mice treated for five days with one of two JAK inhibitors sprouted new hair within 10 days, greatly accelerating the hair follicle growth phase. No hair grew on untreated control mice in the same time period. The research was published in the journal Science Advances.

Paranagama Commission clarifies
There is no reference to a foreign judge component in the Paranagama Commission report, Commssion Chairman Maxwell Paranagama said.
Issuing a clarification under his signature the Chairman said:
The Paranagama Commission felt it appropriate to add what has set out here to the already existing question No. 06 under the subject, Did the Paranagama Commission recommend a domestic or foreign process for accountability
In view of an apparent misinterpretation of the Paranagama Commisison's second Mandate Report on the issue of Accountability, the Commission would like to put the matter beyond doubt as to the nature of this recommendation at Paragraph 625 of the Report.
International Customary Law comprises what States do and what actions States take.
Therefore, in order to deal with an accountability mechanism suitable to Sri Lanka it was incumbent upon the Commission to embark upon a review of measures taken in other countries before proposing a specific mechanism for Sri Lanka. At Paragraph 516 of the Paranagama Report, the Commission deals with a hybrid court in Gambia, who took on judges from the Commonwealth.
In Paragraph 616 of the Report:
The Commission says, "In the event Sri Lanka was to set up a purely domestic tribunal without the participation of any foreign judges, it is the view of the Commission, that there should be international technical assistance and observers".
International technical assistance does not equal foreign judges sitting in judgement over Sri Lankan citizens.
At paragraph 625 under the heading, "A proposed Mechanism", the Commission goes on to set out a mechanism without reference to foreign judges, foreign investigators or foreign prosecutors.
The actual process of a trial is dealt with at paragraph 525V (d) where the trial process is set out as follows.
"The matter will proceed in the same way as any other criminal trial within the jurisdiction of Sri Lanka".
Thus, there is no reference to a foreign judge component.
There is Latin Legal maxin "Expressio unius est exclusion alterius, meaning the express mention of a thing, person or method implies the exclusion of all others.

Police Force obstacles for reform
In the past, respective governments appointed different commissions to look into; in 1945  a crisis in the policing system; in 1970  even worse problems; in 1995  graver problems owing to severe politicization etc. The politicians since 1970s began interfering with the police and created serious law and order issues causing irreparable damages. A civil servant too had been appointed unprecedentedly as Senior DIG (Administration) to look after the administration in 1970s. However, IGP is the Head of the Police Department. All the powers are vested in him to run the administration of the police efficiently and effectively.
IGP is the sole Adviser to the Government in all matters relating to the administration of the police force. IGP is responsible to the Government for anything and everything including  training, discipline, preventing and detecting crime and maintaining law and order and for the efficient discharge of duties by officers of all ranks.
Certain politicians since 1970s took the law in to their own hands! It is perhaps because a large majority of politicians refused to fathom the implications of misrule for their personal gain. If not, they failed to comprehend the need to protect the interest of the country, the people and their well being. It has now become a severe ordeal. Unruly parliamentarians went away with their goons from police custody by force. They tied public officers to trees. Attacked police officers when they issued tickets for high speeding etc. etc. They play merry hell in the well of Parliament too.
Rule of law and good governance
The concept of establishing an independent Police Commission was the outcome after long and careful deliberations. The enactment of the 17th Amendment was thereafter the most significant and sought after achievement in the country after independence. It addressed several issues including politicization of the Police Department, which provided for the creation of the Police Commission  a step in the right direction.
The previous government took steps to enact the 18th Amendment by repealing the 17th Amendment. This was a disastrous step for them. The former regime had also conveniently forgotten that there had been two insurgencies and a devastating war. After winning the war, they failed to do the next best thing for the benefit of the people and the country. The rule of law and good governance was the desperate prerequisite in the country.
The police failed to bring to book politically favoured under-world gangs, drug king-pins, ethanol dealers and other fraudsters. They were also able to buy corrupt politicians and bureaucrats and thereby undermined the police powers using their own illegal and ill-gotten wealth. The international community had therefore urged that the government should take necessary steps to follow internationally accepted conventions, norms and to observe principles of good governance and rule of law.
MS and RW partnership has already enacted the 19th Amendment. This has constitutionally (Clause 155 G) given wide powers to the Police Commission to exercise its authority over appointments, promotions, transfers, disciplinary control and dismissal of police officers other than the IGP.
It is also encouraging the Constitution has specifically granted powers now to the Commission to establish procedures to entertain and investigate public complaints and complaints of any aggrieved person/s made against a police officer or the police service and provide redress as provided by the law.
The Police Commission is accordingly empowered (155 G (3)) to take suitable steps constitutionally in consultation with the IGP and provide for and determine all matters regarding police officers, including;
(a) The formulation of schemes of recruitment, promotion and transfers, subject to any policy determined by the Cabinet of Ministers;
(b) Training and the improvement of the efficiency and independence of the police service;
(c) The nature and the type of arms, ammunition and other equipment necessary for the use of the National Division and the Provincial Division; and
(d) Codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures.
It is extremely important and necessary to take early and meaningful steps to redress the grievances of both the public and serving police personnel. It is also imperative to make the police top officials easily accessible to the general public. According to what I gather from the general public who visit the Presidential Commission to lodge their complaints (thinking we could grant redress) people have suffered untold miseries owing to dishonest unscrupulous police officers.
In Sri Lanka politicians and their henchmen are given protection to continue their illegal practices by the police. The Police officers look the other way when politicians break traffic laws openly in broad day light. If an average citizen does it even mistakenly, police are there to punish them. Sometimes you could escape by giving them a bribe. The general public goes through severe inconveniences owing to these discriminatory practices.
Police Commission
A Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman, down south, a well known IRC, was gunned down in Hikkaduwa by a rival gang. Reportedly, his funeral was attended by all the top politicians in the former regime. There were white jasmine flowers sprinkled from a helicopter  paid for allegedly by another national level politician, when the body was taken to the cemetery. This proves how local IRC type politicians were appreciated by their seniors knowing very well they were wanted criminals.
Police could not apprehend miscreants because politicos protected them knowing they were criminals. This culture of impunity should now be changed. It will not be an easy task therefore for the Police Commission to ensure fair treatment to everybody. However, we now have to compel police officers to treat all citizens equally, with courtesy, consideration and dignity as well.
The first lesson should be what Lee Kuan Yew did in Singapore. In Sri Lanka to begin with the traffic police should be compelled to perform their duties with honesty. The law should be applied equally to everybody. Lee Kuan Yew having assumed duties, in a few days as the Prime Minister, had been copped on his way to office. After he had been issued with a ticket, the Police Officer had been politely requested to present himself in the PMs office the next day.
The Police Officer had been simply surprised that he had copped the Prime Minister the previous day. He did not expect him to be commended and promoted.
LKY had publicized how well the police officer had performed his traffic police duties. He had pointed out to the countrymen that Singapore needed similar Police Officers in order to take the country forward. I have no doubt the present Prime Minister will set the path clear for the Police Commission to implement traffic laws firmly without any discrimination, like LKY in Singapore as the first step in the right direction.
Herculean task
We cannot however expect miracles from the Police Commission overnight. The herculean task before the Commission is to ensure that the police officers are provided with the necessary protection, support and strength to perform all their duties as law enforcement officers impartially with honesty, dedication and without fear or favour, affection or ill-will and without regard to status or political affiliations. The police officers also should now learn to use discretion appropriately in order to build and improve public relations with the citizens.
A Retired senior well respected police officer says the toughest job for the Commission is to restore discipline in the police personnel. He believes the majority now prefer the politicians to give orders to the police. A minority is keen to restore the police to its former glory without political interference. The seniors therefore he says should begin leading by example  By obedience we learn to command and added By being honest we make our men honest. He added that capable, honest, committed and hardworking police officers need to be given necessary powers to conduct proper investigations of crimes, maintenance of law and order and effective preventive action against crime without political interference.
Senior Police officers should therefore; (a) must check their police area always (b) keep the contacts with other senior officers in the area for the prevention of crime and the maintenance of law and order (c) arrange for the proper supervision of criminals (d) arrange for effective and efficient patrolling of the area by day and night (e) supervise the serving of processes and execution of warrants, etc., and (f) co-ordination the collection and communication of intelligence.
It is sad police had no option but to give less priority to the above duties. They had been compelled to provide security to those visiting VVIP causing serious lapses in the divisions instead. The Commission must now ensure that the laws are enforced courteously and legitimate duties are attended to. In exercising their duties, police officers must also conduct themselves, in appearance and in behaviour, in such a way that they inspire confidence and respect for the police service  which is an imperative.
In order to be able to improve the services rendered by the police, a decent salary increase is a must for the police personnel. The general public would no doubt desire to see the police force, consisting of nearly eighty five thousand personnel, performing their duties far better without compromising their integrity by refusing to accept bribes, favours, presents, and for a bottle of high spirits.

Powerful quake rocks South Asia, more than 180 dead
A powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake which rocked parts of South Asia killed more than 180 people Monday, including 12 Afghan girls crushed in a stampede as they fled their collapsing school.
At least 1,000 more were injured and hundreds of homes destroyed as the quake shook a swathe of the subcontinent, sending thousands of frightened people rushing into the streets in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.
It was centred near Jurm in northeast Afghanistan, 250 kilometres (160 miles) from the capital Kabul and at a depth of 213.5 kilometres, the US Geological Survey said.
Initial reports show a big loss of life, huge financial losses in Badakhshan, Takhar, Nangarhar, Kunar and other regions, including the capital Kabul, said Afghanistans chief executive Abdullah Abdullah.
At least 31 people were confirmed dead in Afghanistan and 135 in Pakistan, according to officials, with the toll set to rise.
Exact numbers are not known because phone lines are down and communication has been cut off in many areas, Abdullah said, adding that the government has asked aid agencies for relief.
The quake wrecked huge devastation in some districts, said the governor of Badakhshan province, Shah Wali Adib.
So far 1,500 homes are reported to be damaged or destroyed.
The epicentre was just a few hundred kilometres from the site of a 7.6 magnitude quake that struck in October 2005, killing more than 75,000 people and displacing some 3.5 million more, although that quake was much shallower.
Horrifying news emerged of at least 12 schoolgirls being trampled to death in a northern Afghan province.
The students rushed to escape the school building in Taluqan city (capital of Takhar), triggering a stampede, Takhar education department chief Enayat Naweed told AFP.
Twelve students, all minors, were killed and 35 others were injured.
The quake, which lasted at least one minute, shook buildings in Kabul, Islamabad and New Delhi.
At least 31 people were killed in Afghanistan including the 12 schoolgirls, officials said.
The toll included nine in Badakhshan province near the epicentre; eight in Nangarhar province bordering Pakistan, and at least two in northern Baghlan province, according to local officials.
In Pakistan at least 135 people had been killed, according to a tally from local and provincial officials.
The military put the toll at 123 with 956 injured, and the National Disaster Management Authority put the official death toll at 43, but said it was checking unconfirmed reports of more deaths.
One aftershock hit shortly afterwards, with the USGS putting its magnitude at 4.8.
In a statistical prediction on its website, the agency said there was a one-third chance of the number of fatalities climbing to between 100 and 1,000 people, with several million dollars worth of damage likely caused.
In the Kashmir region, panicked residents evacuated buildings and children were seen huddling together outside their school in the main city of Srinagar.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to Twitter immediately after the quake.
South Asias quakes occur along a major fault line between the two plates -- one under India pushing north and east at a rate of about two centimetres (0.8 inches) per year against the other, which carries Europe and Asia.
In Nepal twin quakes in May killed more than 8,900 people, triggered landslides and destroyed half a million homes.

Saudi prince held in record Beirut airport drug bust
A Saudi prince and four others were detained on Monday in Lebanon in the largest drug bust in the history of the Beirut airport, a security source said.
Saudi prince Abdel Mohsen Bin Walid Bin Abdulaziz and four others were detained by airport security while allegedly "attempting to smuggle about two tons of Captagon pills and some cocaine," a security source told AFP.
"The smuggling operation is the largest one that has been foiled through the Beirut International Airport," the source said on condition of anonymity.
Captagon is the brand name for the amphetamine phenethylline, a synthetic stimulant.
The banned drug is consumed mainly in the Middle East and has reportedly been widely used by fighters in Syria. The security source said the drugs had been packed into cases that were waiting to be loaded onto a private plane that was headed to Saudi Arabia.
The five Saudi citizens were still in the airport and would be questioned by Lebanon's customs authority, the source added.
In April 2014, security forces foiled an attempt to smuggle 15 million capsules of Captagon hidden in shipping containers full of corn from Beirut's port.
Lebanon's state news agency also reported Monday's drug bust, saying the private plane was to head to Riyadh and was carrying 40 suitcases full of Captagon.
Saudi Arabia's large royal family has had past run-ins with authorities in various countries.
Late last month, a Saudi prince was arrested in Los Angeles for allegedly trying to force a woman to perform oral sex on him at a Beverly Hills mansion.
But authorities decided not to pursue the charge, citing a lack of evidence.
In 2013, a Saudi princess was accused in Los Angeles of enslaving a Kenyan woman as a housemaid, but the charges were also eventually dropped.

Warning to pharmacies for selling drugs at higher prices
A flying squad will be set up to detect private pharmacies selling drugs at higher prices violating the agreement made in connection with the prices of drugs, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said. He expressed those views during a meeting held with around 100 district pharmacy organizations representatives 18 districts. The meeting held in Ratnapura recently.
According to Minister Senaratne all should pay attention towards the contents in the rules and regulations and not in the drug policy. There are about 3,000 pharmacies country wide but only around 1,000 pharmacists are there.
The minister said the punishment that should be given to the pharmacies which violate the policy will be decided soon. The first and main objective of drafting the rules and regulations is lowering the prices of drugs. An agreement had been made with private pharmacies about the percentage of profit they earn and it is 85 percent.
Minister Senaratne stressed that the people feel the value of the policy by the low price and the doctors feel the value of the policy by the high quality of drugs. Once the drug quality test laboratory set up in Sri Lanka prescribing drugs in trade names will be totally banned. It will take about two years to do this. We cannot close down 2000 pharmacies which cater to people who do not have a pharmacy to buy drugs.
