Budget rattles strategies of crumbling opposition
This is a post-Budget week with a difference. Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake's budget has an interesting mix of proposals, with considerable price reductions, raising of taxes, and expanding sources of revenue, and a ban of duty free vehicle permits, which has so far not left room for strong criticism.
Not unexpectedly, the so-called "Joint Opposition" in Parliament is making noises about some aspects of the Budget, but the criticism comes in the confusing mix of most of them being members of the SLFP, and this party, also the largest section of the "Joint Opposition", formally deciding to support the Budget. What is exposed is the increasing rift within the SLFP, as President Maithripala Sirisena seeks to strengthen his own hold over the party, as the UPFA crumbles in disarray.
The overall success of the Budget-mix presented by Minister Karunanayake is best seen in cartoons that show Mahinda Rajapaksa and his bearers in the Opposition, being disappointed that the Budget proposals having no taste or spice, meaning for them to make a strong criticism of it or take such criticism to the public. The Budget debate will take its course and see its passage, despite the threat of a No-Confidence Motion against the Minister by a deeply rattled section of the UPFA.
If the Budget is an important political leap for the Government of Consensus, there is the clear emergence of challenges to it, especially in key areas of policy, such as peace building and reconciliation, and implementing of the Geneva 2015 resolution. The loudest opposition is on the proposal to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), and its replacement with a law more suitable to the needs of a country that is at peace, after the defeat terrorism at least six years ago.
The current international debate on terrorism, especially after the attacks in Paris on November13, and the situation of terrorist organizations in Belgium, is used by those opposed to repeal of the PTA, and will come as a key aspect of the pro-Rajapaksa campaigners in the coming weeks, ahead of the forthcoming Local Government elections. MR himself says War Heroes should not be arrested under the PTA, with no evidence whatever for such claim.
Voices of racism
The voice of the former Foreign Minister and teacher of law, Prof. GL Peiris, coming together with that of Wimal Weerawansa, better known for raucous incitement of people, is a sign of the strategy applied by the pro-Rajapaksa "Joint Opposition" within Parliament and supporters outside, to create a new South-based political issue in the country, fully in keeping with their politics of racism and division, and opposition to the policies of the West, in international relations.
The focus of opposition politics in the South is also enhanced by the demand for the release of the Tamil detainees who have been held for several years, most with no charges or indictments or no legal action against them whatever. Voices are already heard warning that the release of these Sri Lankan Tamils from lengthy detention, even with rehabilitation, as thousands of direct LTTE cadres have already been released, would lead to a situation similar to the recent terrorism in Paris, and would be a major threat to national security.
The decibels of opposition to reconciliation have risen after the Government decided to lift the ban on eight organizations of the Tamil Diaspora and 424 Tamil individuals last week. Those who protest at this are certainly mum about eight other Tamil Diaspora groups remaining banned, as well as 155 Tamil individuals.
Post-Geneva 2014
It is noteworthy that the ban on Tamil Diaspora Groups and individuals took place just days after the UNHRC adopted its resolution against Sri Lanka in March 2014 - on March 27 to be exact. Also interesting is that this took place shortly after the UPFA led by Mahinda Rajapaksa won the Western and Southern Provincial Council elections held on March 29, 2014. There is little doubt that the two provincial polls were scheduled for two days after the Geneva vote, to capitalize on the expected defeat in Geneva for political gain at home. As one journalist commented on it at the time, Mahinda Rajapaksa saw this motion against Sri Lanka as another "Sword of Damocles" over him; the fear of the Electric Chair being further emphasized.
The UNHRC Geneva resolution of March 27, 2014 adopted by a vote of 23 in favour, 12 against and 12 abstentions, requested the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to undertake a comprehensive investigation into alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka, during the period covered by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, and to establish the facts and circumstances of such alleged violations and of the crimes perpetrated with a view to avoiding impunity and ensuring accountability, with assistance from relevant experts and special procedures mandate holders.
"Power" politics
The Opposition voices that are against this lift of the ban of some of the Tamil Diaspora and individuals, have also associated it with the arrival of US Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, a very close advisor to President Barack Obama.
As told to the media by GL Peiris, this is also a welcome gift to the US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, the policy of the government being to please foreign powers with scant regard for national security.
This opportunist thinking comes from one who had no concerns about pleasing western powers when he sought to persuade Hillary Clinton, then Secretary of State in the US, to support Sri Lanka in the post-conflict situation, when the US took the lead against the Rajapaksa policies.
This will certainly be echoed by others in the pro-Rajapaksa camp who see the political advantages in the South of being opposed to any or all aspects towards reconciliation and the building of a peaceful Sri Lanka.
With Samantha Power being drawn into the debate against attempts at reconciliation in the country, it would be good if those in the foreign embassies who plan such visits, and others in his country who organize them, also think of the South of this country. No doubt there are matters in the North and East that are of particular interest to these visitors.
But it would be good to remember that the people of the South should not be excluded in such event organizations, which gives strength to the opponents of reconciliation and the new progress towards a better democracy, to carry on campaigns that help divide the North and the South, which is their political goal. Let's not forget that "Elle" is played in the South, too, as are volleyball and cricket, and even hopscotch, all or any of which visiting diplomats or officials of importance could try.
The Galle Dialogue
The Avant Guarde issue and the matter of floating armouries have taken a different turn with three Cabinet Ministers seeking Police action on alleged defamation by the head of Avant Guarde. Away from that, on matters of the sea and naval operations, this week saw the Galle Dialogue 2015, an event of increasing importance on naval and oceanic affairs. The Chief Guest Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe made a very useful contribution, with emphasis on the rising importance of the Indian Ocean in regional naval operations. I shall conclude with this extract from his timely and relevant address.
"Historically, Sri Lanka has always had significant interests in the Bay of Bengal. While Sri Lanka's economic zone falls within the area, we remain committed to preventing international terrorism, transnational crimes and people smuggling in the seas around our country.
"Therefore, the sea is seen as a strategic component of the country's security network. Although substantial resources have been made towards strengthening the security on land, due to internal factors, emphasis on reinforcing high levels of maritime security has been insufficient. In this context, supplementing the blue water capability of the Sri Lanka Navy and the consolidation of the Sri Lanka Coast Guard are areas of concern for the Government. We are also reviewing the possibilities of integrating the capabilities of the Navy and the Air Force.
"The Indian Ocean is in need of a mutually benefiting security architecture established on a Multilateral basis... The maritime security of the Indian Ocean cannot be guaranteed without filling this lacuna. Sri Lanka is willing take the lead to set up a multilateral forum that involves all stakeholders with UN support to address the security issues, including the control of choke points and the maritime security blueprint. Such a forum categorized by a collective approach is likely to set the stage for a timely and relevant mechanism to be established for open and comprehensive dialogue on a range of issues affecting the Indian Ocean in particular, and the Indo-Pacific region in general. The process if institutionalized, will allow for combined partnerships across a range of areas of interest, to Sri Lanka and other participating countries."

Climate crunch to dominate Commonwealth summit
MALTA: The 2015 Commonwealth Summit kicks off on Friday to a grand opening ceremony with Queen Elizabeth, followed by intense working sessions where world leaders will grapple with climate change.
As the clock ticks to a UN climate conference in Paris starting Monday, leaders including France's Francois Hollande, Britain's David Cameron and the UN's Ban Ki-moon will try to open the door to a landmark accord for taming greenhouse gases.
"We look towards Paris and an agreement that will determine the survival of our species and all those who share this precious planet with us," Britain's Prince Charles said in a speech in Malta on Thursday, as leaders arrived on the windswept island from four continents.
"We do not have the right to steal our children and grand-children's inheritance. We do have a responsibility to act now... and I'm sure that the Commonwealth will play a critical and leading part in this endeavour," the heir to the throne said.
Born out of the British empire, the Commonwealth of Nations brings together around a quarter of the world's countries and a third of its population. The 24th biennial summit is expected to focus on the issues of extremism and migration as well as the environment.
Prime ministers attending include Canada's new leader, Justin Trudeau, Pakistan's Nawaz Sharif and Pakalitha Mosisili from Lesotho. The hope is that by finding common ground in Malta -- among countries which differ enormously in terms of culture, size, GDP and diplomatic muscle -- the COP21 talks in Paris can break through a logjam of connected and highly contentious issues.
Potential stumbling blocks in Paris abound, ranging from financing for climate-vulnerable countries to scrutiny of commitments to curb greenhouse gases and even the legal status of the planned accord. - AFP

Croatia discovers 3,500-year-old sunken town

CROATIA: Croatian archaeologists recently announced they had discovered a 3,500-year-old sunken town and a port in the Adriatic Sea near Zadar, a southern coastal city.
We found the remains of a large settlement and a port in the sea between the islands of Ricula and Galesnjak in the Pasman Channel last year. After radiocarbon analysis finished this month, we could say that the remains were probably built around 1500 B.C., Mato Ilkic, head of the archaeological research team at Zadar University, told Xinhua in a telephone interview.
They unearthed various findings during two research explorations in a small part of the settlement, covering a total area of nearly two hectares, Ilkic said.
The most valuable findings were the very rare wood objects from 3,500 years ago, he said.
The laboratory test results on samples of wooden pylons found on the sandy sea bottom showed that the town and port, as well as other facilities, were constructed in the mid-Bronze Age period, according to Ilkic.
The results also confirmed that the sunken settlement was built by unknown communities living along the Pasman channel before the advent of Liburnians, an ancient tribe living in areas of the Adriatic Sea during the late Bronze Age, Ilkic said.
The discovery of this wide site will certainly shed light on a dark period of pre-history -- the Bronze Age of northern Dalmatia, he added.
Last year, using satellite images and aerial photographs, the archaeologists discovered a huge, man-made formation in water three metres deep. Underwater archaeologists dove at the location and found fragments of pottery, wood residues and others, according to Ilkic.
Specifically, they found wooden pylons and other artifacts typical of communities living by the sea, he said. The other finding included a large quantity of goat and sheep bones, a stone axe, and olive pits.

With a little help from Aiyanayaka...
Apart
from the rituals associated with Buddhism many people also believe in a variety of Gods such as Minneriya deiyo, Aiyanayaka deiyo, Kalu devatra and Bahirawa whose blessings are invoked for a variety of reasons. Blessings are invoked in the form of "yatika" to ensure their health, the protection of the weva bund and an adequate supply of water for cultivation. The most noteworthy ceremony associated with the weva is "Multi mangallaya" in which Aiyanayaka deiyo's blessings are sought. This ceremony is performed by the "gamarala" after the rains when the weva is full
The prosperity of a village depends on the availability of water for cultivation. This is especially so in Rajarata where paddy cultivations is the livelihood of the people. It is for this reason, our Sinhala rulers in the past developed an intricate system of irrigation with tanks and canals in order to be certain of a regular supply of water throughout the year.
The storing of water during the rainy season became the main task of the kings. They went to the extent of enacting stringent laws to punish those who flouted the laws governing the distribution of water. Such was the importance attached to the conversation of water in ancient times. Water was considered the life blood of the economy. Therefore Rajarata where the ancient cities stood, namely, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa came to be known as the tank civilization.
Paddy cultivation
The early British administrators too observed how the village economy was sustained by the tank or weva. Therefore the construction, maintenance and distribution of water became the obligation of the people.
With the dependence on the village tank, there emerged customs and rituals connected with it. The people began to invoke the blessings of the deity who looks after the supply of water.
The practice of appeasing the deities in the form of a ritual can be observed in Wanni, where they worship 'Aiyanayaka deiyo' who presides over their well-being. Since the tank and paddy fields were closely linked, it is important to make a study of the paddy cultivation in order to understand the customs and rituals associated with it.
The fields in the village fed by the water of the weva are classified according to their proximity to the weva. This is done by taking into account the quantity of water that it can supply.
The tract of paddy field - "Yaya" close to the weva is called "Udayapota" or "Mulpota". The second tract further out is known as "Harenapota" or "Peralapota". The third is named "Asvaddum pota".
Each tract is further sub-divided into portions known as "Ihalabage" (upper division), "Medabage" (middle division) and "Pahalabage" (lower division).
The crown land sold to farmers is called "Akkaraval". The extent of the land is measured by the extent of grain that is sowed such as "Amuna", "Pela", "Kuruni" etc.
Blessings of guardian deities
It was customary to leave two strips of paddy fields at either end of each tract called "Kurulupaluwa" (birds loss) - an allowance of extra land as compensation for damage caused by birds.
The two strips of land at each end next to the "Kurulu paluwa" are called "Ela pat" and they belong to the "gamarala" (village elder). The portions in the centre "pota" are equally divided among the shareholders or the "Pandu karayas".
The "gamarala" is the co-ordinator of the cultivation system in the village. He choose the dates for the issue of water, clearing the jungle, repairing fences, ploughing, sowing, caretaking, harvesting and also invoking the blessings of the guardian deities.
In all these activities, the villagers act with mutual understanding and co-operation according to customary practices known as "Attam". Money is not paid for services. Instead each villager is obliged to work and in return gets the services of the others.
The system of mutual help prevails even in the temples. When monks depend of monks living in other temples for religious ceremonies like pirith and pansukula, it then becomes obligatory on their part to participate.
Adequate supply of water for cultivation
Apart from the rituals associated with Buddhism many people also believe in a variety of Gods such as Minneriya deiyo, Aiyanayaka deiyo, Kalu devatra and Bahirawa whose blessings are invoked for a variety of reasons. Blessings are invoked in the form of "yatika" to ensure their health, the protection of the weva bund and an adequate supply of water for cultivation. The most noteworthy ceremony associated with the weva is "Multi mangallaya" in which Aiyanayaka deiyo's blessings are sought.
This ceremony is performed by the "gamarala" after the rains when the weva is full. The Mutti mungallaua is performed after the harvest. Once a day has been selected for the "Mutti mangallaya" each household will contribute their share of rice, "kawum", plantains, betel and arecanuts for the ceremony.
After the feasting is over, villagers go in a procession with two new clay pots filled with saffron and incense to the abode of the deity who is believed to reside in a tree on the weva bund. A special dais is created with coconut fronds known as "yahana" under the tree over which a white canopy in hung to give a sanctified look.
On this specially erected pedestal, betel offering is made and the two clay pots are also placed as a form of offering.
The evening begins with a "yatika" by the anumatirala (mouth-piece) of the deity). This is form of an address to the deity. He then begins to dance to the accompaniment of drums. This goes on throughout the night.
At dawn, the pots are taken from the "yahana" and carried to the tree and hung on two branches. In the course of the ritual it is made known to the people by the anumatirala who acts as the medium to the God that he has accepted their offerings.
After returning to the village the anumatirala once again begins to dance to the accompaniment of chanting and drumming. After the mid day meal the people then disperse to their respective homes with the belief of having been blessed and confident of a period of prosperity.
Aiyanar in Tamil means Kaiyanar who sprang from the hand of Vishnu with his 50 names and with as many different types of power.
In the North Central Province the Mutti mangallaya is performed by the kapurala who has taken the role of "anumatirala" and he is paid in cash for his services. After the successful conclusion of the yala harvest, the kapurala invites the villagers to a house in which he performs the 'yatika' throughout the night. A ceremony at the shrine dedicated to Aiyanayaka at the weva bund takes place the next day followed by the weva Rajakiriya in which the "Kiri Ithirilla" - boiling milk - forms the main ceremony.
The blessings of deities such as Aiyanayaka, Kambili Pudurussa, Ilandari, Kadugath Bandara is invoked by the kapurala while "Kiri Ithirilla" is in progress. An all night pirith ceremony followed by an alms giving the following day concludes the ceremonies.
The ceremonies connected with these rituals are known as "Game Rajakariya" which means the rites of the village. There is also "Vele Raja Kariya" perfomed on a lessor note. These deities are of local origin but the rituals are influenced by Hinduism. This happy blending of Buddhism and Hinduism evolved from ancient times and appeals to the minds of the unsophisticated agricultural communities living in the Wanni.

Obama Thanksgiving message on refugees: world 'full of pilgrims'
US: US President Barack Obama Thursday delivered a Thanksgiving message in which he compared modern refugees to the pilgrims whom the holiday celebrates, urging Americans to open their arms to the potential immigrants.
"Nearly four centuries after the Mayflower set sail, the world is still full of pilgrims -- men and women who want nothing more than the chance for a safer, better future for themselves and their families," Obama said in his weekly address, referring to the boat on which the pilgrims arrived in the New World.
Thanksgiving was first celebrated by the group after fleeing religious persecution in England. For many Americans, it has become a family-oriented day marked with an enormous meal of roast turkey, an assortment of side dishes and a slice or two of pie.
"I've been touched by the generosity of the Americans who've written me letters and emails in recent weeks, offering to open their homes to refugees fleeing the brutality of ISIL," Obama said, referring to the Islamic State group.
Immigration has taken center stage as an important issue ahead of the 2016 presidential race but reached fever pitch following the deadly Paris attacks earlier this month.
The shootings and suicide bombings have stirred fears in North America and Europe that jihadists could seek to blend in with refugees in order to strike later.
Obama himself faces a barrage of opposition to his own plan to resettle 10,000 refugees in the coming year.
"People should remember that no refugee can enter our borders until they undergo the highest security checks of anyone traveling to the United States," Obama said.
"That was the case before Paris, and it's the case now."
Obama also reminded listeners that Thanksgiving was not just an opportunity for people to give thanks for their personal blessings.
"On this uniquely American holiday, we also remember that so much of our greatness comes from our generosity," he said. - AFP

Promises KEPT
Followed by his avowal at the funeral of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera to abolish the Executive Presidency, President Maithripala Sirisena initiated action at the following Cabinet meeting by seeking to pursue his intentions. The Cabinet decided to appoint a committee comprising party leaders to study the proposal to abolish the Executive Presidency and to introduce a new electoral system. In the aftermath of the Presidents announcement a discussion has started in SLFP circles; interpretations were made in such political circles about the real intention of the President. It is true that even if Maithri did not plan a political future beyond this presidency, now he is forced to be the leader of the SLFP for the coming period.
Obviously he does not want to leave politics with the blame of destruction of the SLFP. As a populist political leader he may consider himself as the leader who resurrected the SLFP and pulled it away from the racist reactionary pit of Mahinda. Once presidency is abolished then he is compelled to contest the next parliamentary election as the Prime Ministerial candidate of the party. His genuine desire to live up to what he promised to the people at the election does not give him any other alternative. However with Ranil taking somewhat a post modernist political position it may be difficult for him to separate from Ranils political practice.
National government
Along with such serious business happening in the background, the Cabinet recently discussed other matters that have led to antagonism among the ministers. At one point, several ministers took Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva to task over his criticism of the Yahapalana Government. de Silvas criticism spread in cyber space with various websites and social media carrying different stories to suggest that the national government is now fragile. He is reported to have said that the Yahapalana government has been shattered, leaving people in the lurch. If Nimal Siripala continues in this path he may fall into the lap of Mahinda.
The UNP-SLFP National Government is now disturbed with differences. But, it is united and determined to expedite action in conformity with the UNHRC resolution. The release of LTTE suspects, held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), is a serious political issue and unfortunately the government has not completed the process. It has to be taken out of AGs department as a political problem to be dealt with rehabilitation. Alongside, the government mulls the repeal of the PTA, a proposal even outlined in the OHCHR report. Action will be expedited by the pressure exerted by democratic organizations. The campaign for general amnesty by the democratic movements has stirred up tension among patriotic movements in the South led by the trio Wimal, Gune and Dinesh.
Political parties
May be to face the fascistic trio, President Sirisena called for the second meeting of the Political Party Conference to discuss the way forward for the resolution of political questions and to bring about reconciliation. Several political parties had submitted their individual proposals to be considered in this respect. Eastern Province Governor Austin Fernando had assembled these proposals together, highlighting the submissions acceptable to all, and drawing attention to areas with differences. Common ground was found on matters such as the implementation of the recommendations by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), addressing livelihood issues in the war ravaged areas and schemes for the benefits of war widows. Communist Party leader limited himself to the demand for action without delay on commonly acceptable matters, though DEW claimed that the Cabinet was wasting time, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera briefed the political party representatives for around ten minutes, with particular focus on the substance of the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka and the procedure on follow up action.
International interferences
After the ministers remarks, Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Leader Dinesh Gunawardena made a strong criticism for not presenting the reports of the Udalagama and Paranagama Commissions to the UNHRC for lobbying against international interferences. He condemned the government for relying solely on the report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Samaraweera hit back by explaining that the contents of these two locally produced reports were far more serious in depicting crimes on the Lankan side than those in the OHCHR report. Nevertheless, Gunawardena, who is a fascistic leader in the campaign against the UNHRC resolution, affirmed, these were locally produced reports based on the ground realities, but the OHCHR had compiled its reports based on hearsay and evidence gathered from anonymous sources! So Dinesh confirms that serious crimes were committed by the Lankan side too. President Sirisena also allowed Gunawardene to take his time and put forth his views. So there cannot be any mistake.
Though UNHRC resolution does not make the presence of foreign judges compulsory, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), represented by Vijitha Herat, was opposed to the participation of foreign judges. M.A. Sumanthiran, who represented the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), enraged fascistic participants when he said that the implementation of the provisions of the UNHRC resolution virtually became the policy of the government as a co-sponsor of it. LSSP representative Tissa shamelessly took the side of fascistic gang. Tissa condemned Sumanthiran and said the consultation process with the other parties would not serve the intended purpose if that were the case. Maithris political party conference served its purpose by exposing the fascistic chauvinist campaigners hiding behind his leadership.

Rome banishes centurions, rickshaws over tourist scams
ITALY: After two millennia, the last centurions have finally been banished from Rome.
As of Thursday men who dress up as soldiers of the ancient empire and offer to pose for tourist snaps in return for cash were banned from the streets around the Colosseum and the rest of the Eternal City.
Drivers of bicycle-drawn rickshaws and touts selling bus tours or tickets to historic monuments were also outlawed under a decree issued by city commissioner Francesco Paolo Tronca.
The commissioner is running the city pending the election of a new mayor and his decree declared the measures necessary on security grounds and to defend the reputation of Rome by protecting tourists from scamsters. It came ahead of the launch next month of a Catholic Jubilee year which is expected to significantly increase the numbers of visitors coming to Rome.
While many visitors enjoyed their exchanges with the would-be centurions and were happy to cough up five euros ($6) or so for a souvenir photo, recent months had seen some acting in what the decree termed an inappropriate, insistent and sometimes aggressive, manner to obtain larger sums from tourists. - AFP

Suu Kyi blames lack of safety regulations for deadly landslide

MYANMAR: A disregard for the rule of law in the jade mining industry in Myanmar had made accidents such as the landslide that killed more than 100 people at the weekend a common occurrence, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi said today.
Authorities called off search efforts late on Wednesday in Hpakant, with as many as 100 people estimated still missing after a huge slag heap of mining debris gave way on Saturday and buried a makeshift settlement of migrant workers as they slept.
As far as we understand, it was the fifth similar incident this year, Suu Kyi told Radio Free Asia's Myanmar language service during an interview broadcast today.
This sort of accident is common just because there is no rule of law. It also reflects lack of due consideration for the safety of people's life and property.
They were Suu Kyi's first comments on the disaster in Hpakant, where rescue workers recovered 114 bodies before giving up the search.
Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), which swept to victory in the November 8 elections, has called for stricter safety measures and increased government oversight of the industry in the wake of the disaster.
Reforming the sector will be difficult. The lucrative jade industry is dominated by companies linked to leaders of the previous military government, ethnic armies and businessmen with close connections to the former junta. Hpakant is at the heart of the jade mining region and produces some of the world's highest quality jade, but workers, many migrants from other parts of the country, operate in perilous conditions for little pay.
Some work for mining companies, but many others pick over the massive debris dumps that are excavated from vast mines. They hope to find precious stones that may have been passed over. Landslides on the debris dumps are common, especially during the heavy monsoon rains, but rarely this deadly.
Htin Kyaw, a local police officer who was assisting with rescue efforts, said that only 80 of the 114 bodies had been identified. Authorities would now focus on finding safe shelter for survivors, he said.
Now, we are trying to help relocate those who escaped the landslide to safer places, he said.
Exactly how many people were sleeping in the huts and tents is unknown, but Tint Soe, who was elected as lawmaker for the NLD to the lower house for the area, said that he estimated the death toll to be between 170 to 200 people.
