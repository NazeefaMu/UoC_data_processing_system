James Cameron Announces Four 'Avatar' Sequels
Fox ended its Thursday CinemaCon presentation with a surprise guest: James Cameron.
He announced that there will be four Avatar sequels, not the three previously planned. "We have decided to embark on a truly massive cinematic process," he said.
Cameron said as he was planning the three sequels, he found it limiting. "We began to bump up against the limitations for our art form," he said, explaining that he decided he would need more sequels to tell the whole story.
He said each of the four sequels will be able to stand alone, but will together create a saga. His goal is to release Avatar 2 at Christmas 2018 and the a new film in 2020, 2021 and 2022.
"I've been working the last couple of years with a team of four top screenwriters," he said, "to design the world of Avatar going forward: The characters, the creatures, the environment, the new cultures."
"So far, the art I'm seeing, is in pure imagination, really far beyond the first film," he said. "It's going to be a true epic saga."
The 2009 film earned $2.8 billion worldwide.
Cameron also spoke at length in support of the theatrical experience.
"So together, we're going to continue to make this industry the greatest show on earth. That's what we do," he said to strong applause.
James Cameron also slammed the Screening Room, saying "I think it's absolutely essential for movies to be offered exclusively in theaters on their their initial release. So boom."

Malinga ruled out of IPL
After all the furore surrounding the appearance of Sri Lanka's iconic fast bowler Lasith Malinga in Mumbai with the Mumbai Indians squad it has been revealed that he will not be a part of the IPL this season.
Sri Lanka Cricket on Saturday went overboard when they issued a statement to some sections of the electronic and print media stating that Malinga had gone to Mumbai without obtaining prior permission from them and that he was training with the Mumbai squad in preparation to play in the IPL.
However subsequent events have revealed that Malinga had gone to Mumbai to get an assessment on his injured leg from a team of doctors in Mumbai.
Charlie Austin who manages Malinga told the Daily News that the doctors who examined Malinga have ruled him out of the IPL for this year.
"The doctors have told him that his injury would require at least nine months to heal and ruled him out of the IPL," said Austin. "They have stated that he does not need an operation but only rest.
"Mumbai Indians wanted Malinga's fitness assessed so that they could in the event of him being unavailable request for a replacement. He is unlikely to be fit for the upcoming tour of England and probably be out of the Australian tour as well," he said.
Austin said that he would be writing to the West Indies Cricket Board as well withdrawing Malinga from the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) which is due to start in July.
"He told me last week he is not going to play in the IPL and Dr David Young (orthopaedic surgeon from Australia) had told him that if he doesn't get better in another three weeks which is unlikely till now his only option is to have an operation to try and save his career," Austin further explained.
"Mumbai Indians invited him over as a courtesy to meet the squad and the management and their medical staff wanted to look at his injury and see whether they can give any assistance. He was not going to play. (It is relevant to note that Malinga is currently on a two-year contract with Mumbai Indians which includes the current IPL).
"Realistically he can't play there's too much pain. He told me, 'even if I play one game I won't be able to recover for the next, so what's the point I will just ruin my leg and that will be the end of my career'.
"His thinking was he is better off having this operation and try to get fit by the end of the year and see if he can play for another year or so. The operation he probably will have it in Australia. He is anyway taking injections he has been taking them every day for six months. He administers that himself. He told me last week he wasn't feeling any improvement," Austin said.
"If he was fit he would have played in the IPL and earned himself US$1.3 million. Anyone in their right mind would like to earn that kind of money towards the end of their career. He tried to play in the Asia Cup which was a stupid idea and he was in enormous pain and obviously he wasn't fit enough to play in the World T20."
Malinga is expected to appear before SLC's three-member medical panel of doctors headed by Prof Arjuna de Silva on Wednesday to assess his fitness. Based on the Mumbai Indians medical advice he appears to be out of action till September. On the same day Malinga is due to face a disciplinary inquiry as well for allegedly making adverse comments against the SLC with regard to his selection to the Asia Cup and World T20 teams.
Malinga will be the second replacement Mumbai Indians will be calling for during the ongoing IPL. Earlier West Indies opener Lendl Simmons was ruled out with a back injury and was replaced by New Zealand batsman Martin Guptill.
Malinga is an icon whom Sri Lanka or Mumbai Indians or any team would love to have in their side. His statistics speaks for itself: First and only bowler in the world to claim four wickets in four balls in the 2007 World Cup game against South Africa, he had two more ODI hat-tricks against Australia and Kenya thus establishing himself as Sri Lanka's limited-over spearhead. His finest moment was leading Sri Lanka to win the World T20 title in 2014.

Herath winds down career on ODIs and T20Is
Sri Lanka's third highest wicket-taker in Tests left-arm spinner Rangana Herath has announced his retirement from One-Day International and Twenty20 International cricket.
In a letter addressed to Sri Lanka Cricket, Herath said he would like to concentrate on Test cricket - which has always been his personal passion.
He went on to say: "Every cricketer has to stop at the right time I feel it's time to make room for fresh talent to be groomed with the 2019 World Cup in view."
Herath 38 has borne the brunt of Sri Lanka's spin bowling attack since the retirement of legendary spinner Muthiah Muralitharan in 2010 and is currently three wickets shy of reaching the milestone of 300 Test wickets.
In 71 ODIs he has captured 74 wickets (avg. 31.91) and in 17 T20Is took 20 wickets (avg. 20.72) with career best figures of 5/3 against New Zealand that enabled Sri Lanka to go and win the World T20 title in 2014.
Herath has been an integral part of the Sri Lanka bowling arsenal where his brilliant accuracy and subtle variation in pace and flight made him a force to be reckoned with both at home and away.
In an interview with Wisden India during the WT20, Herath described his uncomplicated style by saying: "Wherever I go, I try not to change anything. I give the ball air and try to get the batsmen out. ..... I figure out the conditions... I have faith in me that I can adjust with the conditions" - a philosophy he is likely to share with the younger generation.

SLC rectifies statement on Lasith Malinga

2.) He must be declared 'Match Fit' by physio, trainer, coach and selectors.
Therefore, Malinga will present himself before the SLC panel of expert doctors on Wednesday (20th) and depending on the outcome of the said medical examinations, be required to face a match fitness grading after which SLC will take the next appropriate steps.
We also wish to inform you that there will be explanation called from Malinga with regards to his statements to the media in the recent days, and suitable action will be taken forthwith.

Thailand rout Sri Lanka 7/0
Sri Lanka womens hockey team suffered yet another crushing defeat this time at the hands of Thailand losing 0-7 in their first round match of the World League Womens Hockey Championship match played at Sengaphang, Singapore. At half time the Thais led 3-0.
This huge defeat reflects some kind of short coming in the Sri Lanka ladies team as they beat Thailand 2-1 in the league match of Asian Hockey Cup Championship last year. In the finals of the same championship they lost to Thailand 2-1 after a hard fought battle to clinch the second spot.
The Sri Lankans were represented by almost the same players last year except for a few changes which were considered necessary. Does this mean that the Sri Lankans lasses could not perform well or that the Thailand ladies have shown remarkable improvement since last year. Or motivation play an untegral role. This is something that the hockey authorities should look into when the team returns to Sri Lanka this week.
But how can they remedy this when tour itself was in balance till three days before the girls took the flight over an internal issue. This is something for the Ministry of Sports to look into and take remedial action as they, should ensure that the girls are psychologically in good shape before they are embarking on an international tour.
In the same tournament in another match played against Singapore the Sri Lankan women lost 0-6 after trailing behind 0-3 at lemons. This is a match the Sri Lankan girls won in the Asian Challengers Trophy Hockey Championship 2015.
Did the Singaporeans turn around to inflict this humiliating defeat is another matter should look into or that our women were unable to deliver the goods where they delivered last year.
With this defeat the Sri Lankan girls are out of championship honours and will end up as also rans.
