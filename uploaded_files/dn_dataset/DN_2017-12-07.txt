UNP sure to win over 70 pc of LCs
The UNP will gain control of over 70 percent of the Local Councils at the forthcoming Local Government elections. This is a foregone conclusion because the party's objective is to extend its power to the rural sector, said Rural Economy Minister P. Harrison.
He was speaking to the media after attending the Nochchiyagama Regional Co-ordinating Committee meeting in Anuradhapura, recently.
Harrison said even though there were several futile attempts made to unite the Joint Opposition and the SLFP, no one would be able to undermine the common understanding between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. There were signs that the Yahapalana Government would even continue beyond 2020, he said.
Referring to a statement allegedly made by S. M. Ranjith Samarakoon to the effort that the Joint Opposition would contest the forthcoming election in collaboration with several sections including former LTTE members, he said, this was nothing new because people such as Karuna Amman and Pilleyan had always been their bosom friends.
He said the Joint Opposition followed a policy of duplicity. While inflaming communal passions on one side, they worked in league with extremist forces on the other.
He also emphasized that there was no misunderstanding between the President and the Prime Minister as rumoured by certain parties.
When asked whether the government planned to control protest demonstrations with an iron fist, Harrison said there was no such thing as the government had given full freedom for people to express their views.

$450m 'Leonardo painting' heads to Louvre Abu Dhabi

A 500-year-old painting of Christ believed to be the work of Leonardo da Vinci is heading to the Louvre Abu Dhabi, the museum has said.
The newly-opened museummade the announcement on Twitter, without specifying whether it had bought the painting at auction this month.
Media reports say it was purchased by a Saudi prince.
The work - known as Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World) - was sold in New York for a record $450m (341m).
It was the highest auction price for any work of art.
The unidentified buyer was involved in a bidding contest, via telephone, that lasted nearly 20 minutes.
The New York Times reportedthat it was bought by Saudi prince Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud, citing documents the newspaper had reviewed.
Leonardo da Vinci died in 1519 and there are fewer than 20 of his paintings in existence.
Salvator Mundi, believed to have been painted sometime after 1505, is the only work thought to be in private hands.
The Louvre Abu Dhabi museum opened earlier this month in the United Arab Emirates.
It cost 1bn to build the museum over the past 10 years.
It holds 600 artworks permanently and 300 loaned from France.
The museum pays Paris hundreds of millions of dollars for this as well as for the use of the Louvre name and managerial advice.

AG faults Gota
The Attorney General yesterday alleged that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has obtained an Interim Order by suppressing and misrepresenting material facts of the incident.
Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appearing on behalf of the Attorney General raised objections for delivering an ex-parte order regarding the writ petition filed by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
I have filed limited objections against this order. I can demonstrate on the pleadings filed by the petitioner that there was suppression and misrepresentation of material facts when the application was supported and an Interim Order was obtained ex-parte. I can make my submissions today before this order is extended. I am objecting to the extension of the Interim Order, Dayaratne said.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for Gotabhaya Rajapaksa requested to fix the matter for inquiry since they want to look into the material facts presented by the Attorney General. Court fixed the petition for inquiry on December 15.
Meanwhile, the Court of Appeal (CA) yesterday further extended until December 15 its interim order preventing police from acting against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act regarding a Magistrates Court inquiry.
The CA extended this Interim Order preventing police from acting under the Public Property Act against Rajapaksa, on the Galle Magistrates Court inquiry over a complaint that the D.A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs.90 million.
On November 29, the Interim Order was issued on the basis of an ex parte proceeding by a two-judge-bench comprising Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne. This is pursuant to a writ petition filed by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
Deputy Solicitor Genera Viraj Dayaratne appearing for the Attorney General yesterday filed limited objections against the Interim Order and raised objections for the extension of this order.
However, Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for the petitioner sought a further date for the inquiry into the matter citing that he was yet to peruse the objections raised by respondents.
The Court upheld Rajapaksas version that the certificate issued under section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act is ultra vires or violative of his legitimate expectations.
Rajapaksa cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director Shani Abeysekara, FCID Director Ravi Waidyalankara and the Attorney General as respondents.
Rajapaksa also seeks an order in the nature of a writ of prohibition preventing the respondents from proceeding or relying upon the certificate filed under and in terms of section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act against him.
Rajapaksa maintained that the offences against the Public Property Act contains a provision in section 8(1) as amended where, upon the certification by a Police Officer that the value of the matter exceeds Rs. 25,000, it will not be competent for the magistrates court unless in exceptional circumstances to release such a person on bail after recording reasons.
Rajapaksa stated that one such method was to say that there was a criminal offence committed by Rajapaksa regarding monies belonging to the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Board (SLLRDC).
Rajapaksa stated that recently he was informed that he is to be arrested. He further said that originally the proceedings reflect a possible charge of money laundering. He stated that there is no offence whatever in respect of the said matter.
He states that the D.A Rajapaksa Foundation, a statutory body, entered into a contract with the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation Department for the construction of a monument at Madamulana in Weerakatiya. Rajapaksa states that there was no written contract.
He stated that, at all times the petitioner, the Foundation and SLLRDC acted on the basis that there was a contract between the SLLRDC and the foundation and that the foundation would pay to the SLLRDC lawfully due for the construction of the monument.
He states that the monument was unveiled on or about November 6, 2014 though not complete, because that was the death anniversary of the late D.A. Rajapakse.
The petitioner states that the government changed in January 2015 and the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation Board came under the Megalopolis Ministry, under Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka.
In August of 2015, the Foundation received a request for a part payment which the Foundation paid. The petitioner pleads that thereafter he received a letter of demand. The petitioner states that the said Attorney, who sent the letter has on several occasions acted for and on behalf of the Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka.
The petitioner states that at no time has the Foundation denied the liability to pay the money but has only queried the quantum. When the Petitioners statement was recorded by the FCID Petitioner requested for a government valuation to be obtained.
The Petitioner said the Government Valuer has in fact valued the construction at Rs. 33 million but the Foundation has not been provided a copy of the Government valuation. The Petitioner pleads that at all times, the SLLRDC accepted the said monies as payments made in terms of the contract between the foundation and SLLRDC.
The Petitioner said he was informed upon the government valuation had been made known to the foundation; the foundation had on or about July 13, 2017 paid the balance sum of Rs. 33 million and thus paid SLLRDC the entire sum of government valuation.
Rajapaksa states that the foundation will be agreeable to have an arbitration to cause a fresh valuation of the construction if the SLLRDC is not agreeable to act upon the government valuation already obtained. The petitioner states he is aware that the Foundation would contest the action contemplated in the said letter of demand only to the extent of determining the actual value due.
Rajapaksa states that a court of competent jurisdiction will inquire into the said matter and will determine the cost of construction and the balance payment due which the Foundation will have to pay. The petitioner states that, in terms of the papers filed in the magistrate court, ex-facie there is no offence disclosed under and in terms of the imperative provisions of Offences Against Public Property Act.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva with Ali Sabry PC, counsel Sugath Caldera and Ruwantha Cooray under the instruction of counsel Sanath Wijewardane appeared for Rajapaksa. Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appeared for the Attorney General.

When the petition came up before Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne, the matter was fixed for December 13.
Sudesh Nandimal Silva who was in remand custody at the time the incidents took place, has filed this writ petition citing the Prisons Commissioner General, the CID Director, Inspector General of Police, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister and the Attorney General as respondents.
Silva said he was bringing the Courts attention to what he saw and was within his personal knowledge of the said tragic incidents to obtain the reliefs.
On November 9, 2012, at about 1.00 pm Silva and other prisoners at Welikada prison received information that personnel from the Army and STF were about to enter the prison to conduct a search operation. He got to know that here was an argument between prison officials and a TID, STF contingent waiting at the prison gate on the procedure related to the search operation.
Silva stated that the prison was in the control of the Army until 10 am on November 10, 2012. By that time, 27 prison inmates had been killed by the STF, Army, TID and Prison Intelligence combined operation.Silva has made a complaint to the CID on February 2, 2015. He stated that although four years had lapsed since the brutal killings of these prisoners, no action has yet been taken by the police or the Attorney General to conduct the investigation and prosecute offenders.
This petition was filed through senior counsel K.S. Ratnavale and counsel Senaka Perera. Senior State Counsel Manohara Jayasinghe appeared for the Attorney General.

Awaken your roots!
Chemical dye can wreak havoc on your hair and can even damage it permanently. The answer to all your hair colouring woes may lie in one product: Henna. This small flowering shrub produces a natural and organic hair dye that makes a great, safe alternative to synthetic hair dyes. Follow these guidelines and you will find that it is a cinch to dye those beautiful tresses and get sensational results.
What is Henna
Henna is a small flowering shrub that has many uses. The fragrant flowers are used to create perfume. The leaves are dried and then turned into a fine powder that is used for dying clothes, hair and temporarily dying the skin. The leaves of the Henna plant contain a natural and very effective colouring pigment. This orange/red dye is released as the leaves are crushed. Drying, milling, and sifting the Henna leaves into a fine powder maximize the pigment. Henna comes purely in powder form.
Purpose of Henna
Henna is a good source for people who want to get rid of gray hair, and for people who are allergic to chemical colourants. Generally most of us use Henna for protecting our hair from the sun and dust. Henna can make your hair strong and nourish it from the roots. Use Hanna to get silky and shiny hair.
Benefits of using Henna
Applying a Henna pack twice a month makes hair glossy, healthy and voluminous. It repairs the damaged hair strands and restores the acid-alkaline balance of the scalp. It is an amazing conditioner for the hair because it protects the hair strands by building a protective layer while locking the nutrients and moisture. It is the best and safest way to colour your hair because it has no ammonia, chemicals, and toxins. Henna can be used to treat dandruff and scalp infections effectively as well.
Types of Henna
Henna is created from ground up dried leaves and the powder is mixed in various ways to get the desired type of paste. There are different types of dye ranging from Black Henna to Herbal Henna.
*Black Henna
Black Henna is Henna that manufacturers have added black dye to to create darker tattoos or black hair colour. The chemical called Para-phenylenediamine is used to make Henna black. Some Black Henna can be harmless while others can be very harmful. Henna is very safe and natural but when you add black dye to the henna, there is a risk that you might develop skin problems. Always carry out a skin allergy test before using the product.
*Red Henna
Red Henna is used often to dye hair. It is a great natural alternative to regular hair dye, but it is important to know that everyones hair will not turn out exactly the same way since the dye is a natural product. Your hair color will come out some shade of reddish-orange depending on the darkness of your original hair colour. It is also known to leave your hair feeling thick and silky.
*Natural Henna
Natural Henna is most commonly used for temporary body art. It is also used for hair conditioning and dying. If you use Natural Henna to dye your hair - expect a rich dark brown shade as a result. It will make your hair strong and shiny. Natural henna will leave a brownish orange stain on your skin in the desired design if you use it for temporary tattoos. How dark the henna will appear depends on the kind of Natural Henna used as well as how long it was left on the skin to stain.
*Herbal Henna
Herbal Henna is also us ed for staining the skin for temporary tattoos as well as a treatment for the hair. This type of Henna is known mostly for its medicinal properties. It is great for promoting hair growth, curing scalp disorders and giving the hair natural strength and life. It leaves behind a rich reddish-brown colour, so make sure you want this colour before proceeding. So if you are looking for a dye that will leave you with a rich colour and a soothing scalp relief, Herbal Henna is the perfect choice for you.
Henna and health conditions
a. Cancer patients
Always speak first to your doctor or healthcare specialist before you apply Henna if you have cancer, are being treated for cancer, or are a cancer survivor on cancer-treatment medications. That being said, Henna is a great natural alternative for the individual looking to steer clear of chemicals and keep all toxins out of their system.
b. Those sufferingfrom dandruff
Like psoriasis, dandruff can cause unseemly itchy flakes on the scalp. Dandruff is often the result of a fungal infestation. Hennas antifungal properties keep the flakes and itching at bay. When applied, the natural hair dye binds itself to the keratin that is in your hair and creates a protective layer. This protective layer relieves your scalp of irritation. Dandruff is caused by excessive oiliness on the scalp. Henna actually reduces oil, thus reducing the dandruff.
c. Pregnant/breast feeding women
This depends which type of Henna you use. You will need to be sure that your chosen product is safe, particularly if youre applying Henna as a hair dye during pregnancy.
Its often suggested as an alternative if you want to avoid chemical hair dyes while you are pregnant. It gives your hair a semi-permanent colour, and is available in a number of shades. However it is always best to check with your doctor before use.
d. People with allergies
A patch test before you use Henna can reassure that you are not allergic to Lawsone, which is the red-orange pigment that is present in the leaves of the Henna plant. Simply apply a small amount of the Henna mixture to your skin and wait for at least one hour. 
Although allergic reactions to Henna are very unusual, the effects are mild - your head and scalp will itch. Allergic reactions to PPD (para-phenylenediamine) - found in synthetic dyes and adulterated Henna - can cause reactions such as redness, burning, itching and irritation of the scalp, face and neck.

BBDO Lanka was recognised as one of the most creative agencies in the region once again when it was awarded the 'Rest of South Asia Creative Agency of the Year - Gold' award by Campaign Asia-Pacific at its Agency of the Year 2017 awards. The South Asian region awards were announced and presented at a gala dinner held in Mumbai, India on December 5.
This is the third time that BBDO Lanka has entered the prestigious competition and been awarded a Rest of South Asia Creative Agency of the Year award. It previously took home the Silver in 2012 and Bronze in 2015.
BBDO Pakistan took home the 'Pakistan Creative Agency of the Year - Bronze' award whilst BBDO India's Hermant Shringy was named 'South Asia Creative Person of the Year 2017'. Rajat Mendhi of BBDO India was named 'South Asia Strategic/Brand Planner of the Year 2017 Runner-up'.

We have been recognised with awards, here in Sri Lanka and abroad, for our work on Anchor, Janashakthi Life and Piramal Glass. Winning Campaign Asia-Pacific's 'Rest of South Asia Creative Agency of the Year - Gold' for our work overall is the icing on the cake.

## Title: A boost for healthcare

A boost for healthcare
Sri Lanka is one of the few developing countries with a completely free healthcare service for its citizens and even for foreigners who walk into any Government hospital. The Government spends billions of rupees on the health service every year, but more needs to be done to make it even better.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne on Sunday outlined a series of measures that will be taken soon in this regard. For a start, the Health Ministry expects to produce 80 percent of its drug requirements by the end of 2018, which will save US$ 400 million spent annually to import drugs for Government hospitals. This is in fact a long-delayed fulfillment of the plans by the visionary Dr. Senaka Bibile for local drug manufacture. Accordingly, the importation of all drugs which can be produced locally (around 1,000 drug varieties), will be stopped by end 2018. The prices of such pharmaceuticals will further come down as they are manufactured locally. Moreover, it will be a fillip for local drugs manufacturers who work in partnership with the State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation.
This is another feather in the cap for the Minister, who fought hard to bring down the prices of many essential imported drugs and surgical items such as stents in the face of fierce resistance by multinational companies which sold these drugs at a huge mark-up. To cite just one example, there was one injection sold for Rs. 100,000 which is now available for just Rs. 19,759. One can only imagine the kind of profit these companies made by fleecing innocent patients.
The introduction of the free 1990 Ambulance Service in collaboration with the Indian Government was another revolutionary step. Although a politically motivated GMOA initially opposed this service, it has become a true life saver for residents of Western and Southern provinces where it is currently operational. It has so far saved the lives of 21 critically ill children, not to mention hundreds of adults. The service will be expanded island-wide next year.
However, there are certain critical instances where even an ambulance cannot go fast enough. Most countries have an Air Ambulance (Flying Doctor) service to serve such patients. The Sri Lanka Air Force engages in this task at the moment, but given its own operational requirements and other constraints it cannot offer a full-time Air Ambulance service. Now the Health Ministry plans to procure eight Airbus helicopters for this purpose with German assistance, in addition to 28 state-of-the-art emergency vehicles. This will be a revolution not only in Sri Lanka, but also in South Asia. However, upgrading hospitals is equally important. With this aim in mind the Government hopes to establish European standard hospitals in Hambantota, Panadura, Dambulla, Matale and Embilipitiya with German, Netherlands and French aid.
All this will come to naught if there is no proper database and record system for Government hospitals. Hence the Ministers plan to digitize the countrys healthcare system via an E-Health policy. According to the E-Health policy, all citizens will be issued E-Health Cards which will record their health conditions so that any doctor can have a descriptive medical history of the patients.
The E-Health System will be introduced to 45 Hospitals in the next two years and expanded to 300 hospitals following the initial implementation. This will be complemented by new software introduced to track and manage medicine availability in main hospitals in the country. It is also important to record some health information in the new NIC and driving licences, so that paramedics and doctors can react quickly in the case of traffic accidents and also take steps towards presumptive organ donation.
Budget 2018 has already allocated funds for several additional medical faculties, which will help realise the goal of having two to three family physicians (General Practitioners) for every 5,000-10,000 families. This project is worth US$ 200 million which will be provided by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the World Bank. These family physicians should provide reports on all families they are responsible for, every six months.
Today, most people tend to rush to the nearest public or private medical centre for even minor ailments, but this will be a far better alternative as the GP will be their first point of contact. The GP will then be able to recommend any specialist consultation or treatment, which will save time and money for patients. The Government will also restart recruiting Public Health Medical Officers and Public Health Medical Nurses for village level healthcare monitoring activities.
All these steps will augment Sri Lankas enviable status in the world healthcare rankings. The WHO has recently praised the present Healthcare System in Sri Lanka as a role model to the entire world. It has also lauded the countrys tobacco control methods, which have ensured a 15 percent drop in cigarette consumption in just two years. In fact, health and education are the two pivotal elements that keep Sri Lanka ahead of the curve in South Asia. These new measures will no doubt boost this standing.

Brandix associates graduate from Gap programme
A group of 181 Brandix associates recently completed Gap Inc.'s Personal Advancement & Career Enhancement (P.A.C.E.) programme for female workers in the apparel industry.
The programme provides workers with foundational skills, technical training and support to help them advance in the workplace and in their personal lives. Three separate graduation ceremonies have been organised to recognise the achievement.
The third such batch to graduate in the past five years, the group included 29 associates from Brandix Fast Fashion I,Mirigama, 16 from Brandix Fast Fashion II, Mirigama, 41 from Brandix Fast Fashion, Minuwangoda, 33 from Brandix Essentials, Koggala, and 62 from Brandix Essentials, Rambukkana.
The P.A.C.E. programme that produced these graduates recorded an impressive retention rate of 87 per cent this year. To date, 464 Brandix associates have completed the course, the company said.
Significantly, the P.A.C.E. programme for these associates was conducted by Brandix's own internal trainers, some of who had previously graduated from the same course.
"Gap Inc.'s P.A.C.E. programme is designed to inspire and help female employees gain the skills and confidence they need to advance at work and in life," Anusha Alles, Head of CSR & Corporate Communications at Brandix said. "P.A.C.E. graduates have progressed well in their careers and contributed more to their workplaces, their peers and their families."
Three P.A.C.E. graduates have been promoted to Group Leader and two as Technicians at Brandix Essentials; while two have been promoted as Trainee Mechanics, two as Technicians, and another two have received staff promotions at Brandix Fast Fashion, Alles disclosed.
These success stories are of M.K.S. Dilhani and Niluka Priyadarshani from Brandix Essentials, Koggala who began the P.A.C.E. course as Team Leaders and were promoted as Group Leaders ten months later; W.G.J.K. Ranwala and W.M.D.S. Wickramasinghe from Brandix Essentials, Rambukkana who began the course as Team Leaders and were promoted to Group Leader and Trainee Mechanic respectively eleven months later; S.D. Shanika Viduwanthi Dissanayaka and S.M.N. Rosani from Brandix Fast Fashion II, Mirigama who began the course as Team Leader and Group Leader and were promoted as Trainee Mechanic and Technician respectively ten months later; and W.B.C. Priyadarshani Wijesinghe from Brandix Fast Fashion I, Mirigama who began the course as Group Leader and was promoted to Technician ten months later.
The course comprises of eight modules of life skills education including communication, problem solving and decision making, time and stress management, water, sanitation and hygiene, financial literacy, legal literacy and social entitlement, general and reproductive health and execution excellence.Launched in 2007, Gap Inc. operates the P.A.C.E. programme in 16 countries including India, Cambodia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, Jordan, Myanmar and Sri Lanka, and has trained more than 65,000 women. Research shows P.A.C.E. graduates are more productive, have lower rates of absenteeism and are promoted faster than factory workers who do not participate in the programme.
In addition to the P.A.C.E. programme, Brandix has also graduated 35 female mechanics that completed on-going in-house training courses on sewing machine maintenance and repair in yet another example of the Group's commitment to the empowerment of female employees.

Britain thwarts plot to kill May
UK: Two men have been charged with a plot to kill British Prime Minister Theresa May and a court hearing on the case is expected on Wednesday, British media reported.
Naaimur Zakariyah Rahman, 20, and Mohammed Aqib Imran, 21, planned to blow up security barriers outside Mays Downing Street office and then stab the British leader to death, the reports said.
The reports came a day after Home Secretary Amber Rudd told parliament that 22 Islamist terror plots had been thwarted since the killing of a British soldier on a London street by two Islamist extremists in 2013.
Nine of the plots have been uncovered following an attack outside the British parliament in March in which five people were killed, Rudd said.
The UK is facing an intense threat from terrorism, one which is multi-dimensional, evolving rapidly and operating at a scale and pace we have not seen before, Londons Metropolitan Police said on Tuesday.
The police said there were now 500 counter-terrorism investigations involving 3,000 people and more than 20,000 other people have been investigated in the past.
Britain has seen five terror attacks this year, which killed 36 people and injured more than 200 others. Four of them were claimed by the Islamic State group.
Three of the perpetrators were known to security services, according to an internal review which said opportunities to stop the Manchester Arena bombing attack were missed by security services. - AFP

Cabinet nod for amendments
As the takeover of Hambantota Port by China Merchant Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort) draws near,Cabinet yesterday brought in amendments to the share ownership structure of the public private companies established under CMPort and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority.
On July 25, 2017, CMPort, SLPA, the Government, Hambantota International Port Group (Private) Limited (HIPG) and Hambantota International Port Services Company (Private) Limited (HIPS) signed the Concession Agreement in relation to the development, management and operation of the Hambantota Port.
In the signed agreement CMPort agreed to invest an amount of up to USD 1,120.00 million into the Hambantota Port and Hambantota port and marine-related activities, of which the total amount to be paid to SLPA for the acquisition of the 85% issued share capital of HIPG shall be USD 973.658 million and HIPG would use a portion of that to acquire 58% issued share capital of HIPS.
The above now has been amended to allow 85 percent of the initial equity share capital of the HIPG to be held by CMPort and its affiliates and 15 percent of the equity share capital to be held by the SLPA. In addition, 58 percent of the initial equity share capital of the HIPS will be held by the HIPG while 42 percent of the equity share capital of this will belong to SLPA.
In November, Cabinet also amended the Concession Agreement to change the payment clauses to allow 30 percent of the sum to be paid on the date of signing, 10 percent after a month since signing and to pay the remaining 60 percent within six months of signing.
CMPort will take over operations of the Port on Saturday, December 9.

Campaign against selling shares of state banks
Ceylon Bank Employees Union (CBEU) President T.G.W. Gunawardena said yesterday that the Public Resources and Human Rights Protection Center, a combination of 19 trade unions representing the government, semi-government, private, banking and insurance sectors will launch a massive campaign against the 2018-budget proposal of selling shares of state banks in the stock market.
Representatives of 19 Trade Unions signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) yesterday with the aim of defeating the budget proposal of selling shares of state banks in the Stock Market.
The MoU was signed at the Public Resources and Human Rights Protection Center yesterday.
Gunawardena said this budget has laid the foundation for selling the shares of state banks in the Colombo Stock Exchange. The aim of this proposal is to direct the state banks towards privatisation through the Public Private Partnership. If not for the state banks, people especially small scale entrepreneurs will have to obtain loans at 50 percent interest rate from other banks. This is very unfair, he said.
CBEU Assistant Secretary Keshara Kottegoda said Budget 2018 has removed duty concessions on essential items while imposing several new taxes on various goods and services which will further burden the people.
It has also placed emphasis on selling state properties to the private sector. However, no political party or politicians speak against this injustice. That is why 19 Trade Unions were getting together to raise their voices against these injustices. We will defeat the proposal of selling state bank shares by organising a massive protest and conducting public awareness campaigns in the future, he said.

A Christmas Wish
I have never written a letter or sent an email to Santa. Have you But I know, like me, you might be constantly sending a few imaginary emails to Santa asking for various impossible gifts now that its time for him to pay us a visit. If you ask me what I would like for this Christmas I would say all I want is to sit down in a cosy corner with Dostoevskys Brothers Karamazov, a good cup of tea, and an uninterrupted hour. That shouldnt be an impossible gift for Santa to give me, should it
But looks like Santa wont find it so easy to grant me this wish. I cant even remember the last time I had such a luxury. Could it be that this sounds familiar to you as well Do you long for time and a place to do some writing Are you an artist deep inside you with no time to pursue your dream Do you love to relax by building model boats, doing cross-stitch cushion covers, or patchwork quilts Or, every once in a while do you just like to sit back and dream or contemplate about the moon and the stars and how insignificant you are in this whole universe
If the answers are yes, its important that you schedule some me time for yourself every day. As Fawne Hansen says in her article Why You Should Schedule Some Me Time Every Day, the most important reason for this is that, taking some me time can help you avoid irritability and enable you to control your emotions. If you live with your family, or even a pet, they may not understand your need to take me time but they certainly will appreciate the way your mood has improved. Both the people who are close to you and the people you work with, will appreciate that you have greater stamina and better ability to concentrate. Moreover, the lack of time to yourself can cause you to build up resentments that can harm both you and your relationships. When you spend all your time filling other peoples cups, its likely yours will run empty. Sometimes, especially when were tired, we may become angry about giving so much.
But, alas, most of the time we minimize our need for me time by thinking about how we are denying attention to other things that are important to us, such as our family, our friends, our gardening time, tidying the house time or whatever else. We feel selfish taking the needed time out when theres so much left to do. However, if you run yourself into the ground you are not going to be much help to anyone, and you wont be able to be fully engaged in your activities anyway. Your health is vital, and if you think these obligations cant succeed without you, think of what might happen if you become sick and have to set them aside for a longer amount of time. You need a little time to recharge your batteries.
So, if your batteries seem to be sending the alert indicating its time to slow down, if all your days seem hectic and out of control, why not create a private retreat where you can go to unwind, read, and take sanctuary from outside intrusions Without adding on to your house, if you look carefully you can definitely find a special spot that is yours alone.
And, you will be pleasantly surprised how easy it is to escape from your busy life without going to Bintanne, the Bahamas or Hawaii.
While its true that older homes, like planters bungalows in the tea estates, have nooks and crannies in places like large cupboards in the guest bedroom that is a great place to hide from the outside world, if you are living in a modern home, such a place might be non-existent. Still, do look around your home.
You are sure to find a quiet corner of a bedroom or study... Some place where you wont be interrupted by a telephone ringing or a computer announcing that you have a message.
The good news is this private space doesnt have to be big, but it does have to be furnished with your favorite things. If you long for a spot to curl up with a book, you must have a good reading light, a comfortable chair and a place to set a chilly thambili or cozy cup of tea. Experts, however, say, you have to be very careful about where you place a comfortable chair.
If you must, position it with the back of the chair to the middle of the room so that you can look out a window. Spend some time getting the view just right and make sure what you see is soothing and not distracting. Place a small table next to the comfortable chair, one that is just big enough for a book, a cup, and a lamp. Dont be tempted to put anything else on the table. You dont want anything to distract you! But, if you have a collection of books that give you a sense of comfort find a place for the most treasured ones near your reading nook. Favorite novels or poetry can inspire you to continue on your quest for even more. When you settle down to read, you will be able to glance over to the shelves, think of when you enjoyed reading those special books, and anticipate a wonderful experience with your most current volume.
Could it be that a cross-stitch cushion cover from your grandmother is one of your most prized possessions Does it help bring back wonderful memories of your time together If so, dont put it away in a closet so it wont spoil! Keep it out, place it over your favorite reading chair, so that those special memories are right at hand every time you glance into your corner. And think of ways that you can create new memories with it.
Be sure to remove anything from your chosen space that does not enrich the area.
Theres nothing so disturbing as having clutter, extra papers, or trash. It is important that you get rid of anything and everything that does not contribute to the serenity and calm of the area. Books should be arranged neatly, papers should have a place, accessories should be added sparingly. The only things left in your private retreat should be functional and practical and contribute to your sense of well-being.
When everything is in place, your personal retreat will be ready for you. It will be the place you gravitate to when you want to rest, want to indulge yourself, want to pursue your special interests, or just get away from it all.
Remember not to feel decadent or wasteful when you escape to your private area, though. Instead, be grateful that you recognize the importance of taking some time to reinvigorate yourself.
Appreciate your time alone. Get reinforced mentally, physically, and emotionally. Your life will be richer for it and those around you will recognize the change in your attitude and personality
If you dont have a special space already, give yourself this gift come Christmas. When you have everything just right, close the door, turn off the phone, put on some soothing instrumental music, and read to your hearts content. And dont be surprised if you doze off.

With regard to banks, there is a wide group of stakeholders such as shareholders, depositors, borrowers, employees, other financial institutions, regulators, government agencies and suppliers that we need to address.

## Title: Contempt of Court action against Padeniya

Contempt of Court action against Padeniya
The Court of Appeal yesterday observed that there are sufficient material to issue a ruling against Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya.
This is in respect of a charge sheet filed against him over contemptuous statements.
Accordingly, Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Dr. Padeniya and fixed the matter for inquiry on March 10, 2018.
A charge sheet was served in open court on GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya by the Court of Appeal for allegedly undermining the Court of Appeal judgment dated January 31, 2017 which was delivered compelling the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register MBBS graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) provisionally as medical practitioners in terms of the Medical Ordinance.
However, Dr. Padeniya through his lawyer had informed the Court of Appeal that his client was not pleading guilty to the charge sheet when it was read out by the Court stenographer.
On a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal had issued an Interim Order(IO) preventing the GMOA President from making or publishing further contemptuous statements or articles scandalising the Court of Appeal until the final determination of this Contempt of Court action.
Two civil society activists Prof.Sarath Wijesuriya, the Convener of National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) and Gamini Viyangoda, the co-convener of Puravesi Balaya Social Movement had filed this Contempt of Court action naming GMOA President Dr.Anuruddha Padeniya as the respondent.
The petitioners stated that upon the delivery of the said judgment by Court of Appeal, the GMOA has condemned and openly criticized the said judgment demanding the annulment or setting aside of the said judgment.
The petitioners further stated that in this backdrop the GMOA headed by Dr. Padeniya has called for a national front and trade union action against SAITM following the Court decision in ordering SAITM medical graduates to be registered with the SLMC.
The petitioners stated that on or about April 7, 2017 the GMOA had organised island wide trade union action against SAITM halting all health services including private practice and private health services to stress on the Government to abolish SAITM.
The petitioners stated that the contemptuous statements and comments demonstrate the blatant hatred of the respondent and publication of the same in the said speech indubitably disturbs the Court process and hampers and undermines the authority of the Court of Appeal in respect of the administration of justice especially in view of the fact that the said speech was published and telecast on several media and has been uttered by the respondent at a public meeting held under topic of Abolish the SAITM on April 4, 2017.
The petitioners are pleading that Dr. Padeniya be charged on the offence of Contempt of Court of Appeal under Article 105 (3) of the constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka. Presidents Counsel Upul Jayasuriya appeared for the petitioners. Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana with Ravindranath Dabare appeared for the respondent.

Derailing talks between Podujana Peramuna and President:
Dayasiri blames two key JO members
Sports Minister and Co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Dayasiri Jayasekara cast blame on two key persons in the Joint Opposition (JO) for derailing negotiations between the Podujana Peramuna led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the SLFP led by President Maithripala Sirisena.
One of them wants to become leader in another 20 years, so he wants the split to continue, Minister Jayasekara added addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing at the Department of Government Information.
According to Jayasekara, Mahinda Rajapaksa, Basil Rajapaksa and President Maithripala Sirisena were interested in working together but the resolution of any conflict between the two factions within the SLFP was being held hostage by these two individuals.
The various parties within the UPFA have said they wanted to continue talks within the Alliance. Their one request was to contest the Local Government elections independently and we allowed for that,he added whilst the SLFP Central Committee also made the decision to only back SLFP members at the upcoming polls.
As the decision to contest the polls separately has been taken, Minister Jayasekara was of the view that under the current political system, no one party would be able to win a majority stake at the Local Government elections,
Under the new mixed system, if a party does not win at least 60 percent of the seats, they will not be able to take power of the local government. According to our analysis, no party at present can win that majority.
Thus in certain places, the SLFP might win, UNP in others and other parties like Pohottuwa depending on their campaign. Thereafter all parties will eventually have to get together to run the local government, he explained.
Co-Cabinet spokesperson Gayantha Karunathilake said the UNP had met at Temple Trees on Tuesday evening to discuss the strategy for the Local Government polls.
He believed that it was customary for the public to vote for the party controlling the central government in order to have the Local Government work for them.
The SLFP in the meantime too hopes that its position at the national level will give it an edge at the Local Government polls. We can now work for our electorates because we are in power.The SLFP voter will not have benefitted otherwise, Minister Jayasekara said.

Dehiwela orphanage case taken up today
In sworn statements to Police, 18 teenage girls who were living at the Darun Nusra orphanage in Dehiwala said they were systematically sexually harassed and abused by a long-time male employee.
They said they repeatedly complained about the behaviour to the mans wife, the resident administrator of the orphanage, and were told not to take it seriously. In response she threatened them, saying that the orphanage would be shut down if they reported the abuse, Police documents show.
The Kohuwala Police have since charged Mohamed Sarippuge Mohar, 62, with sexually harassing the girls in the orphanage.
The statements made before the Police during the course of the investigation revealed that one of the 18 girls was seriously harassed by the alleged perpetrator, leading them to file separate charges against the suspect for serious harassment.
Marini de Livera, the Chairperson of the National Child Protection Authority, said the case is one of the most significant her office is currently investigating.
And yet, despite the charges against Mohar, Dr. Mareena Reffai, the founder of the Almuslimaath Foundation, which oversees the orphanage, dismisses the young womens accounts as fabrications.
There has been no medical evidence of sexual abuse of any child, she said in a statement after Mohars July 25 arrest. Instead, she argued, the allegations are part of a plot by employees to take over the orphanage. Reached by phone, Dr. Reffai stood by her defense. As far as we are concerned, we dont have any evidence at all, she said. She said the investigation continuing for three months, and Mohars subsequent release on bail, was proof that there wasnt evidence of sexual misconduct.
But NCPA Chairperson de Livera flatly denied Reffais assertion. Thats stupid, she said. Thats what they always say. The perpetrators side is always very powerful, she added. (They) will do everything possible to sweep it under the carpet.
After initially being taken into protective custody, the girls are now living once again in the orphanage, according to Western Province Department of Probation Commissioner Chandima Dissanayake.
The matron and the husband have been removed, she said, which led probation officers to believe it was safe to return.
But it appears the Foundations leadership is skeptical of the ongoing sexual harassment investigation, highlighted by Dr. Reffais statements. NCPA Chairperson de Livera said the investigation into the allegations is lagging, because authorities have had a hard time getting the institution, and the victims, to communicate with Police.
Reffai, on the other hand, said she and her organization have cooperated with investigators 100 percent.
Its a difficult job, said de Livera. We are delving deep into it, because we dont want them to wriggle out of it at the preliminary hearing in court.
Mohamed Sarippuge Mohar was a driver at Darun Nusra orphanage for nine years. He drove the girls to and from the international school they attended every day, according to the account he gave to Police.
The victims say that much of the alleged sexual abuse occurred in his vehicle.
This man took me to school every day, and would harass me on the way and touch me, one of the young women told officers, whose names Police have concealed to protect their identities.
When I complained to his wife, she said dont take it seriously, and scolded me. Every time I complained, she scolded me, she said. In addition, the man took me to a store room and touched me inappropriately.
All 18 young women accused Mohar of touching them in the transport vehicle, Police reports show. Some said the unwanted contact also occurred in the orphanage.
When nobody is around, he hugs me and kisses me, another girl said.
Mohars wife, Sithi Saahira, told investigators that her husband loved those girls, and didnt mean to hurt them. She denied any harassment had taken place. Mohar has since been released on bail, and is due to appear in Gangodawila Magistrates Court today (December 7).
He and his wife no longer work for the orphanage. The girls remain at the Home, and are attending school, Western Province Probation Commissioner Disanayake said.
But the upper management of Almuslimaath continues to deny the young womens allegations.
In a phone interview Monday, Dr. Reffai said the fact that probation allowed the girls back into the Home, after the suspect and his wife were dismissed, was proof no harassment had occurred.

Does e-grandparenting sound meaningful
I bow my head with great respect to late Dr Arthur C Clark, the former Vice Chancellor of the University of Moratuwa of international acclaim, for his pioneering fictional efforts to pave the way for a brave new world through satellite communication. Now, we live in a digital world with the ultra-modern equipment due to the unending efforts and perseverance of the scientists of the yesteryear, on one hand, and on the other hand, due to classical literature invented by literati who revolutionized human thinking. In a profound analysis, the poet is a seer. Imaginations of the writers put the world in a good stead. This brilliant fictional seer illuminated the world, not in uncertain words. The pen is mightier than the sword.
Since my eldest daughter migrated to Australia with her husband and their only son at toddling, I have been in communication with them through IMO, the desktop messenger. We, my beloved wife and I, have been enjoying this novel experience of effective communication since then. By the time our grandson was taken there, he was only six-months-old.
Effective communication
Our daughter Amalka and the son-in-law Thisara left no stone unturned to create a nourishing intellectual environment for our grandson to develop his intellectual potentialities to the fullest through minute planning in addition to their inherent intellectual genetics in their DNA. In a sense, our grandson Himath Keshawa is fortunate enough to hail from an intellectual lineage which has generated many a brilliant intellectual to Mother Lanka, one of his grandfathers being the Dean of the Faculty of Arts of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Prof Chandrakumara Pathirage, and Thisaras father a reputed architect, all the uncles well stationed in life- an eye surgeon, a charted accountant, and an electrical engineer, maternal grandparents post graduate diploma holder graduates.
Himas father is an engineer with a doctorate from the University of Queensland and mother is a professionally qualified English medium maths teacher.
The afore given factual information, I hope, prepare me a convenient backdrop to come to my focal point of effective communication between my grandson and us two, his grandparents, through IMO. All this time I have been monitoring the smooth progress of the childs potentials. Now, he has developed to a level of operating most of the modern electronic gadgets with utmost care. The educationally devised playthings he uses propel him forward to acquire the necessary skills.
Inherent intellectual capabilities
Hima, our grandchild enjoys e-grandparenting to his hearts content. We are on cloud nine. He is always looking forward to seeing us. He practices his swimming lessons in mimicking on IMO. He sings and dances. His musical shows make us aghast. His bedtime reading has marvellously improved. He draws beautiful pictures by looking at the drawings shown on IMO by my wife. He sings with us a lot. His only aunt Navoda who is reading for her doctorate in civil engineering at The University of Regina, Canada is always unlocking his inherent intellectual capabilities. She plays the role of a catalyst. From three countries far away from our grandson, we are making a concerted effort to give the world a novel experience of a hitherto unexplored sphere, my attempt is to introduce a new word to express this experience through terminology or else lexicology as it may be applicable.
I have been perusing through many a thesaurus, encyclopaedia, dictionaries and other relevant resource materials and even inquired from my learned friends whether they had found a word to describe how the grandparents whose grandchildren are in faraway countries do grandparenting. These circumstances compelled me to ponder on and ultimately I was able to invent this term or word. When I was reading for my GCE (A/L) examination one of my classmates brought a new word to the classroom. It was kota uda, it simply means a particular work or programme is in vain.
One defect that is palpable to me in e-grand parenting is lack of emotional aspect. The genuine warmth between grandparents and grandchildren thrives through physical contacts. It is reasonable. I humbly believe that even in the absence of that aspect e-grand parenting could suffice to define the concept.

German firms may reconsider  UK links without Brexit clarity
German firms will reconsider their trade links to the UK if there is no clarity on a Brexit deal by March, the country's business lobby has warned.
Joachim Lang, head of the powerful BDI, told the BBC there was "a certain urgency" for companies that do business in Britain.
After meeting with the UK government, he said firms would need a year to brace for a "no deal" scenario.
The BDI recently asked its members to prepare for a "very hard Brexit".
"We cannot wait until March 2019, that's obvious," Lang said, referring to the date on which Britain is due to leave the European Union.
"You need to be prepared, otherwise the damage will be much bigger, and in these contingency, plans, one year ahead - that's pretty normal, so we need decisions by March 2018."
"In certain sectors the damage is already close", he added, singling out German manufacturers that source important components from the UK.
Britain imports more goods from Germany than any other country, and exports more to Germany than any other European nation.
Lang, who met with Prime Minister Theresa May last month, said the complexity of Britain's withdrawal from the EU was "probably bigger than some people expect it to be".
"If you look at 20,000 legal Acts that the United Kingdom is going to leave, 750 international agreements that will be no longer valid - this is causing a lot of headaches all over Europe and it should also cause this headache [in the UK]," he said.
"The longer [the negotiations take], the closer politics comes to reality in business." Although some German industrial sectors have reportedly seen exports to Britain drop because of the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, Lang stressed the country's business community "completely supported" the way negotiations were being handled by EU representatives in Brussels.
"I have just come from a meeting with the CEOs of German companies and we are very much aligned - it is one direction," he said.
Lang reiterated the BDI's long-held position that the EU's so-called "four freedoms" - the right to move goods, capital, labour and services around member states - were inseparable, and would not be compromised in pursuit of a Brexit deal.
"This will not happen, and it's a very romantic idea that it could happen, because the EU27 at the end is more important than just one single country, even if it is the United Kingdom," he said.
"There is no doubt that we regret the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. We all want to do business, and we want to go on doing business." (BBC)

Government to set up Programmatic Project Preparation Facility

The government will set up a Programmatic Project Preparation Facility (PPPF) to ensure the smooth implementation of public investment projects.
A cabinet paper put forward by the Prime Minister this week noted that in the 2017 Country Portfolio Programme Performance Review (CPPR), the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs and the World Bank were of the view that lengthy project preparations and inception processes have an adverse impact in achieving the desired outcomes and smooth implementation of the projects
The World Bank thus agreed to provide prior funding assistance of USD 4 million for World Bank funded development projects through the PPPF to carry out successful project preparation, design and initial implementation activities.
The PPPF, the cabinet paper stated will provide the government, the certainty of funding availability for preparatory activities, allowing government entities to plan and prepare public investments efficiently.
The objectives of the PPPF have been described as, to improve quality at the inception of projects, to improve the implementation mechanisms, to enhance the capacity within implementing agencies of the GoSL and to produce standard project preparation documents
The PPPF is to be centrally managed and coordinated by the National Planning Department of the Ministry of national Policies and Economic Affairs and implemented through various Project Implementation Units (PIU).
Its time frame has been decided to be three years from July 2017 to June 2020 and will expire at the end of the current Country Partnership Framework (June 2020).
The World Bank will monitor the implementation progress of the PPPF and project teams of the World Bank will work directly with the PIUs to ensure that the PPPF is implemented as expected.
Cabinet also granted approval to allocate USD 3 million for project preparatory activities of the PPPF for the year 2018.
They also allocated Rs 20 million in 2018 from the Consolidated Fund for the Foreign Finance Associated Domestic Expenses of the PPPF to cover taxes and other administrative expenses.

Hats off to Forces
Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country- President Kennedy
Its the right time to think about President Kennedys statement as countrymen of this soil. There is nothing we can do which can repay those who have so sacrificed that we might be free, but everything we do does count in some small way. Abraham Lincoln put into proper perspective what we do to celebrate the lives of those who have been willing to pay the uttermost farthing for our freedom. We cannot dedicate  we cannot consecrate  we cannot hallow  this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.
Then follows the challenge for us. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us  that from these honoured dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion  that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain  that this nation, shall have a new birth of freedom  and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
The Civil War has long since ended, yet the veracity of Lincolns statement rings equally true today as it did over 150 years ago. We cannot allow the ground where our brave have fallen. They consecrated it with their blood and their lives. And not only had the ground fought over during our Civil War but around the globe where we have fought to prevent expansion of liberty-destroying socialism, the fiendish tyranny of dictators and freedom-trampling totalitarians and terrorists around the world.
The English philosopher John Stuart Mill put this dichotomy into even more stark personal terms. He reasoned, War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things; the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks nothing worth a war, is worse. A man who has nothing which he cares more about than he does about his personal safety is a miserable creature who has no chance at being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.
Our men and women in uniform
Thousands of our sons have served honourably, wearing our nations military uniforms. Of those, many have made the ultimate sacrifice with their lives, and more than that have been wounded in combat, in defence of freedom. Yet the value of their sacrifices including their personal lives and those made by their families is truly inestimable and incalculable. The true significance is found in acknowledgement of the ultimate sacrifices made for our freedom, by our men and women in uniform. It is the reflection, acknowledgement, and gratitude for the sacrifices made by relatively few, so the many may enjoy freedom and liberty today.
One day is not sufficient to pause from the daily grind and celebrate the lives and sacrifices of those who have perpetuated our nation  this One Nation. It is through our lives need to reassess our own conviction to the principles that those who have worn the uniform of our young nation have been willing to sacrifice their own lives for, in order to preserve the legacy of freedom, from one generation to the next. Question relies on the feeling of patriotism in the present generation.
Adlai E. Stevenson, the fifth United States Ambassador to UN said, Patriotism is not short, frenzied outbursts of emotion, but the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime. I agree wholeheartedly that it is the dedication of a lifetime that defines true patriotism. Our sons have given not only their time, dedication and effort butmost importantlytheir very being to the protection and advancement of this country. They work tirelessly for the rights.
Many of the present generation have forgotten how much hardships our sons have gone through to protect this island with misconceptions on one hand and to protect the sovereignty.
General Douglas McArthur, an American five-star general and Field Marshal of the Philippine Army delivered his farewell speech to the cadets at the US Military Academy in May 1962.
He used the occasion to eloquently reference the nature and character of those who so choose to serve us. When I think of his patience under adversity, of his courage under fire, and of his modesty in victory, I am filled with an emotion of admiration I cannot put into words. He belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest examples of successful patriotism. He belongs to posterity as the instructor of future generations in the principles of liberty and freedom. He belongs to the present, to us, by his virtues and by his achievements. In twenty campaigns, on a hundred battlefields, around a thousand campfires, I have witnessed that enduring fortitude, that patriotic self-abnegation, and that invincible determination which have carved his statue in the hearts of his people.
Heroic sacrifices
In the midst of the pain, death, and horror of war there are numerous stories of ordinary people stepping up to the plate and making heroic sacrifices for their fellow soldiers and countrymen. Although the names and stories of most of these everyday heroes perish with history, every once in a while, one of those stories becomes a legend and is told from generation to generation. Serving is one thing. What our sons did during their times of service is incredible. We cannot thank them enough for putting their lives at stake to protect the freedoms we hold so dearly. But, they have gone even farther.
Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in the world.
I am sure that our sons sacrificed their lifetime do not have such a question to rise in their lives. Our dear sons of the soil. Thank you for the service that you have given (our) country and for the service that you continue to provide. You have not only protected but also educated, not only saved but also enriched, and we cannot thank you enough for this. We will always remember that freedom isnt free and those who are willing to pay the price, the time away from their families, the endless dangers of the battleground, are true heroes. Thank you."
It is through the efforts of teachers and mentors that we grow and learn. The dedication you have shown in continuing your service from the front lines and in wartime to instilling a passion for public service into the hearts and minds of young men and women will never be forgotten. Because of the experience weve had, we are now indebted to you for your military service and your mentorship. Your service and sacrifice will never be forgotten.
We are truly grateful for your service to our country.

Homes for differently- abled in two years
Our aim is to end the suffering of homeless differently-abled persons within the next two years. First, we have to change the mindset of the people to make them think that differently-abled persons are equal to others. They only need love. There are many homeless differently-abled persons across the country, stated Minister of Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage S. B. Dissanayake at the national celebrations of Elders International Day on December 3 at Diwulapitiya.
We are collecting the relevant census through Samurdhi officers, Samurdhi managers, social service officers, development officers and Grama Niladharis. We have already handed over 10 houses to them in the Divulapitiya Divisional Secretariat. The programme will continue in all divisional secretariats in Sri Lanka, the Minister said.
He added that the Budget allocation by past governments for differently-abled persons was poor. We are planning to allocate more money for them in the Budget 2018 after discussing with the Cabinet. We will also hold discussions with 23 ministries. We will negotiate with them to provide more facilities to them, he said.
They will be provided with a good service by establishing new centres with modern facilities, he said.
The Samurdhi campaign will assist programmes for differently-abled persons. We are strengthening Samurdhi Banks which were financially damaged by previous administrations for the last 10 years.
We will provide leasing facilities, pawning facilities, instant loan facilities and stock loan facilities through Samurdhi Banks and those banks will be modernized with digitalization. We will spend money on programmes to educate and empower differently-abled persons until they find a job, the Minister said.
We are conducting a national concert called Sith Ru which is coloured by differently-abled persons. Apart from that, we are conducting a national sports meet for them, which will directly link with Paralympics. Record holders of national sports meets will be sent to international events. We are planning to build centres for differently-abled persons, especially in the war affected areas, he added.
Today we are paying about Rs. 3,000 as a monthly allowance for 30,000 persons but about 67,000 have newly applied. Still, we are working on it and at least 10,000 differently-abled persons will be getting the allowance soon.
Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake, Western Province Governor K. C. Logeswaran, MP Dr. Kavinda Jayawardane, MP Ajith Mannapperuma, Provincial Ministers Chandana Jayakodi, Kithsiri Manchanayake, Dr. Rasia Pendise and political leaders, NGO leaders and officers participated.

## Title: How critical are Cyber Security Operation Centres

How critical are Cyber Security Operation Centres

(Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of eCybersec)
In the day and age of sophisticated digital hackers, your concern should not be if you are going to get hacked, but what you are going to do when it happens. Cyber Security today is ubiquitous and enormously complex.
Advanced Cyber attacks have become so sophisticated that they can hardly be distinguished from normal events or system failures. While businesses learn to protect themselves better, criminals are simultaneously devising ever more sophisticated techniques to penetrate their security perimeters.
Attracted by the unprecedented financial rewards a cyber attack can deliver, increasing numbers of threat actors are actively seeking and targeting corporate security flaws.
In response, Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are being established to combat security issues as they arise, and to provide a swift response and resolution. For this reason cyber security requires continued deep insight into systems.
Enterprises and organizations are putting ever-stronger emphasis on their cyber security ecosystem, and with good reason. As digital and data and information assets continue to gain in strategic importance, cyber threats are also rising.
Attackers and hackers have access to a wide variety of sophisticated technologies and techniques to breach an organizations defenses. Consequently, cyber security is a crucial part of safely and successfully managing business, technology, processes, and people. Stakeholders are looking for reassurance that an organizations security posture matches its needs today and preferably tomorrow as well.
There is a growing awareness that traditional approaches to safeguarding financial transactions, customer data, and confidential assets are no longer enough to protect against advanced cyber-attacks.
The adoption of more modern defensive techniques has become mandatory. Using the right building blocks, including a suitable IT security platform and team, next generation security operations can be implemented to keep innocent parties safe and cyber criminals at bay.
Just like the companies themselves, every cyber security team is different. Companies that recognize the importance of Information security will invest the necessary amount to ensure that their data and systems remain safe and that their SOC team has the resources necessary to deal with modern threats.
The cyber security operations center roles and responsibilities are fairly
Straight forward, but distinct in their requirements. Investing in a cyber security operations center (SOC) can be your saving grace during an attempted advanced cyber security attack.
Cyber security is no longer just an IT problem, it is an organizational issue. Find out if a cyber security operations center is the ideal solution for securing your enterprise against modern sophisticated cyber threats.
Further a cyber security operations center continually monitors a business cyber security, preventing serious breaches in real time. Many enterprises now find that expanding detection capabilities begins with setting up a Security Operations Center (SOC) a virtual nerve center that coordinates a business information security functions.
Leaders with managerial and technical experience can aid in workflow
Management and provide security analyst training. Having a well integrated, easy to-use case-management system that doesnt get in the way of investigations and seamlessly interacts with other SOC tools is key.
This tool ideally provides metrics on how effectively your SOC monitors, detects, and contains cases and will allow an organization to identify gaps in people, processes, and technologies.
Cyber incident will happen, and every organization should have proportionate incident response and management strategy, and incident readiness processes in place. Forensic readiness should be considered important and business requirements should focus on this.
The need for and relevance of a SOC has never been more pressing and pertinent. Cyber-crime and cyber-attacks are daily events that need to be defended against.
An effective SOC provides considerable assurance and the ability to respond appropriately and effectively in the event of an attack. However, a SOC in isolation is futile, it needs to be viewed as a coherent package alongside IT and physical security, which are all mutually supporting; if one element is weak the overall security is fragile.
Having properly trained, motivated and appropriately supervised personnel in each area is an essential element to the holistic security solution. In tandem, appropriate policies and well-practiced procedures will mean that timely and suitable responses can be enacted to mitigate the impact of all security incidents.
Organizations are inundated with security information overload coming from disparate and often decentralized security systems operating in individual silos.
To address these problems, organizations must carefully plan and deploy an SOC that centrally manages and monitors the network and security systems across a diverse IT environment.
To be effective, the SOC demands the use of a comprehensive security
Information management (SIM) solution. Security information management tools offer a comprehensive security management and incident response platform designed to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and visibility of security operations and information risk management. Take the time to know your business needs and technical requirements for an SOC based on your security policies and network infrastructure.

I almost moved to Australia when I was not selected  Roshen
DELHI: Test debutant Roshen Silva spoke about the time when he almost threw in the towel and moved to Australia
when he got so frustrated at not being picked to play for Sri Lanka.
The 29-year-old right-hander from Ragama had been consistently knocking on the door for selection with his outstanding form in the domestic competition scoring over 6500 runs in 104 first-class matches with 18 centuries. He was a member of the Test squads for the recent home series against India as well as the one played in the UAE against Pakistan.
I was so frustrated at not being selected that financially I wanted to move on and go to Australia and play some league cricket. But representing Sri Lanka was always my dream. I had few offers from clubs as well but thought that I needed to play for Sri Lanka and that kept me going, said Silva after playing a match-saving knock of 74 not out to earn Sri Lanka an honourable draw against India in the third Test played at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium here on Wednesday.
When I was with the A team, Avishka Gunawardene (A team coach) gave me encouragement to go on. India is the worlds number one ranked team and I wanted to do something special. No one expects to score a duck on debut. In the first innings I had no clue to what happened as I faced only three balls. Since I had been waiting for this opportunity for years, I badly wanted to do well. We wanted to do something special. We actually wanted to win. I wanted to bat for as long as I can. All four Indian bowlers are quality bowlers. When you stay at the wicket for some time, you realize which that pitches will turn and which one will not turn. That helped me, he said.
It was huge pressure. I thought not to think of it as an international game but to take it like a club match. I was keen to get my first ten runs and had a few targets and that came in handy. Thilan (Samaraweera batting coach) told me it was bad luck when I got out for a duck in the first innings. He said Test cricket is like that and reminded me that I had come here through hard work. He wanted me to believe in my ability. When I came for tea, he told me if I can score about 65 or 75 and save the game, I would have secured my place. I was determined to finish it off.
The series that turned his and Dhananjaya de Silvas fortunes was in Sri Lanka As tour to West Indies early this year.
No one saw that West Indies series. But that was a massive challenge. It was as tough as India. Dhananjaya was superb in that series. First match we were beaten. There were two pacies who were bowling at 145kmph and one guy was bowling at 140kmph. There were two good spinners as well. The challenge there was huge. You cant simply explain, said Silva. I think the three knocks that I played in West Indies helped me to get a spot here, said Silva. The coaching staff I am sure would have said how well we played. Avishka and Charith (Senanayake) our manager saw our effort. I know how much Dhananjaya will be happy. I am over the moon for him.
Silva recalled that during the drinks break with 30 minutes of play left for the day Niroshan Dickwella his partner came and asked him whether he was going for his hundred.
I told him look here, saving the Test match is of paramount importance. You never know. Going for personal milestones, if you lose a wicket, thats it. This is a funny game. This is a very clever Indian team. I told him to forget about the hundred, we will close shop here, said Silva.
Dickwella is a positive guy. His idea was that scoring a maiden hundred that too in India was a huge effort. We had to score 117 runs in 50 minutes. He was ready to go for it. But I told him that drawing a game in India is as good as winning one. Dickwella wants to change a game always. I cant play like him. I cant play scoops, I cant play flicks. When he does that, the other team goes on the back foot. That is important, he said.

The Icon of Trust that has withstood the Test of Time
Despite the technologies have changed tremendously, the very first telephone number that we published for the company still rings and we hear the cheerful voice of our clients asking for products and services said Asoka Jayawardena, Director - Marketing & Operations of ABC Computers (Private) Limited. I was glad to meet the entrepreneur and professional who made his venture thrive from the beginning through ethics and values he ingrained in his organization from its birth. Now, let's know his story.
Q: Let us know the fascinating legacy of your venture you have nurtured so painstakingly over the years and which has turned into the icon of trust cherished by consumers in their quest to have a hold on the exclusive products and extraordinary services you offer
The Icon of Trust that has withstood the Test of Time
A. Our birth was humble with an entire operation based in two rooms with four people, known as Advanced Business Computers (Private) Limited, flexed it muscle and came into being on 12th of November 1992 at Ward Place, Colombo 07 at a time when the works of a computer or the versatile business machine's worth wasn't even known although it's far too familiar to us today.
At the inception, we concentrated on Desktop Publishing through the use of specialized software and high resolution printers to design and produce cost effective commercial quality printed material to Sri Lanka's advertising industry which was revolutionary and made us a sought after company for such work. Somewhere around 1995 with the emergence of IBM compatible computers, the strangle hold and influence over Sri Lanka's computer industry which the proprietary brands had waned, then Advanced Business Computers moved in to fill the void in computer hardware. Our multimedia equipment like the CD - ROM's, Sound Cards, Speakers, were in great demand and this opened doors for us to formulate a strong distribution network where dealers were located all over the country. We added networking products and telecommunication equipment into the product portfolio and this resulted in us being recognized as one of the largest IT equipment distributor in Sri Lanka. In 2002 we re-launched our company as ABC Computers (Private) Limited in salutation to the people who faithfully patronized us so long, remembering us simply as ABC.
Year 2002 was yet another turning point in our journey. United Tractor and Equipment Limited famed as UTE who are the Sole Distributors for Caterpillar products in Sri Lanka entered into a strategic partnership with ABC and the awesome power of the new association propelled us to effortlessly make our presence felt in the corporate world and in government undertakings.
Q. It's a fascinating story no doubt but how is it that you only are seen clearly amongst a plethora of competitors
A. It's purely due to our mission, our motto and what we stand for - We Deliver.
We Care. In this trade once somebody pays for an item - the deal is closed. One of the critical components in technology sales being the aftersales support, we are known for first-class customer support focused on rectifying any issue quickly and straightforwardly.
Our team is there for you whenever you need: advice and consultancy, spare parts, repairs and upgrades ABC's after-sales service team is devoted to providing fast and reliable delivery of genuine IT equipment and accessories to ensure efficient repairs and minimize downtime of your company. Even major repairs will be carried out speedily with the least possible disruption. Since inception, we have always worked with world class brands such as HP, Dell, Apple, Wacom, Cisco, Intel, who are also renowned for their superior aftersales support hence we too continue to extend the same levels of support to our clients.
Q. What are your future plans
A. We always align our core competencies to be in unison with the rapid technology changes taking place at lightening speeds in the industry. We've got elaborate plans to soon make Sri Lankans to have easy access to their Cloud requirements, IoT product lines, Security Threat Management software and several e-Government initiatives. ABC has a vision to be best in what we do.
So we may not be the biggest but we will strive to be the best in our offerings to the clients on all our products and offerings.
We have completed 25 years in business and we are confident that you will see ABC Computers (Pvt) Limited into many more years offering superior products and services to its clients.

ICRA Lanka revises long term ratings of  Dunamis Capital
ICRA Lanka Limited, subsidiary of ICRA Limited, a group company of Moodys Investors Service has revised the issuer rating of Dunamis Capital PLC (DCP) to [SL]BBB (pronounced SL triple B) with Stable outlook from [SL ]BBB+ (pronounced SL triple B plus) with stable outlook. ICRA Lanka also revised the issue ratings of the two Rs 1 bn Senior Unsecured Redeemable Debenture programmes each, totaling Rs 2 Bn to [SL]BBB (pronounced SL triple B) with Stable outlook from [SL] BBB+ (pronounced SL triple B plus) with Stable outlook.
The revisions in the ratings factor in the depletion in DCPs core-capital base because of the impairment losses of its subsidiary, namely Premier Synthetic Leather Manufacturers (Private) Limited (PRIMO). Consequently, the standalone market value based gearing (debt/fair value based net worth) increased to high levels of 4.68 times as in March 2017 as compared with 2.14 times as in March 2016. ICRA Lanka also takes note of increase in finance cost of the company, on account of the leverage which coupled with the Impairment losses impacted its overall profitability in FY2017 (net loss on a stand-alone basis for FY2017 was LICK 627 mn vis-a-vis the loss of I.KR 44 mn in FY2016). ICRA Lanka expects the standalone profitability to remain under pressure till the leverage is brought down to reasonable levels. The ratings continue to factor in DCPs status as the holding company of First Capital Holdings PLC (FCH; issuer rating of [SL]A- with stable outlook).

Impose death penalty for elephant hunters- Sajith
Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa yesterday stressed the importance of meting out capital punishment for those involved in the killing of the famous Galgamuwa tusker, also known as Dala Puttuwa in order to protect other tuskers.
He made this observation at a media conference at his Ministry in Sethsiripaya, Battaramulla yesterday.
Addressing the media, the Minister stressed the importance of bringing amendments to the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance to impose the death penalty for elephant hunters.
The Minister also proposed to appoint a Tusker Protection Task Force covering all national wild life sanctuaries and wild life zones.
Minister Premadasa who does wild life photography as a hobby said that he has a huge collection of photographs of Dala Puttuwa and other tuskers and plans to publish a book in the near future.
He further said that he is willing to distribute the royalties from the sale of his book to the Tusker Protection Task Force which he proposes to establish in the future.
Only 6-7 percent male elephants in Sri Lanka have tusks and the rarity of tuskers among elephants in Sri Lanka is due to the disappearance of the important tusker gene due to ivory racket, Minister Premadasa charged.
He further said that the country failed to maintain accurate data on elephants since no proper survey had been conducted recently.
He stressed the necessity of conducting an indepth survey on wild elephants.
He proposed the Dry Zone as the ideal place to conduct a proper survey claiming that wild elephants move to reservoirs in search of water during this period mainly from June to September.

ISMM intl seminar and  45th annual celebrations held
The Institute of Supply and Materials Management (ISMM) hosted its international seminar, under the theme Leveraging Supply Chain Management to Enhance Sustainability recently in Colombo.
The keynote speech was delivered by State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne in the international seminar that saw the participation of over 350 including regional partners from overseas.
The seminar was organized in the sidelines of ISMMs 45th anniversary celebrations. Founded in 1972, the ISMM was established to foster the professional development of the purchasing and supply functions in Sri Lanka and incorporated by the Act of Parliament No 03 of 1981. The institute is currently headed by ISMM President R L Nalin Silva.
Internationally renowned supply chain management professionals including Maj. Gen(Retd) M S S Krishnan from Hyderabad, Prof Amal Kumarage, Dr Krizz Chantirapom, Dr Namali Sirisoma, Noman Lutfi and Prof J M S L Bandara attend the seminar. The Institute of Supply and Materials Management produces world class professionals in purchasing and supply chain management as per demand.
This year the ISMM has increased the number of courses conducted in supply chain management to 26, the highest being the Graduate Diploma in Purchasing and Supply Chain Management which goes on for three years, GDPSM with dissertation contains 120 credits and it is designed equivalent to special degree offered by a recognized university in Sri Lanka functioning under the UGC. In addition ISMM will be increasing the number of workshops, consultancies, seminars etc. for the members and students to update their knowledge in supply chain management. ISMM is also strengthening their marketing strategies, in addition to the education. The quality of the ISMM products will also be developed and enhanced.
The four biggest organizations in the world, Google, Apple, Emerson and Facebook is more concerned about supply chain management, said Nalin Silva President of ISMM. During the last three years where the highest temperature was reported in the world, supply chain management has taken measures to convert heat waste to solar power which has made a huge contribution to the globe.However climate change - heat and water will certainly affect to the supply chain and the predicament of some companies due to extreme weather conditions is well known.
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.
Therefore this year the ISMM increased the number of courses conducting in supply chain management. The ISMM mission is focused on creating world class professionals through continuous upgrading of skills , knowledge and attitude which make a professional in the field of supply chain management.

The Institute has also obtained the ISO 9001- 2008 quality management certificate from the SLSI. The global economic trends through sustainable development taking place have changed for better with the involvement of the role of supply chain management since the new era of the 21st century. The largest retailer Alibaba does not have any retail shop in the world. The largest media provider, Facebook does not have any contact.
Now companies do not hire people instead they outsource and therefore it is our responsible to develop and take supply chain and materials management to the next level in Sri Lanka and across the globe, Silva urged.
At the 45th celebrations held the same day Minister Dr Harsha De Silva participated as the Chief Guest.

Jerusalem is Israel's capital, says Donald Trump

President Donald Trump has announced that the US now recognises Jerusalem as Israel's capital, overturning decades of official US policy. Trump described the move as "a long overdue step" to advance the Middle East peace process.
The fate of the ancient city is one of the thorniest issues between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel called Trump's move "historic" but there has been sharp international criticism.
Trump said the US still supported a two-state solution to the longstanding conflict, if approved by both sides, which would essentially see the creation of an independent Palestinian state living alongside Israel.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called Trump's announcement "deplorable", saying the US could no longer be a peace broker. Eight of the 15 nations who are currently members of the United Nations Security Council have called for the body to hold an urgent meeting on the US decision by the end of the week.
Why is this significant The decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital puts the US at odds with the rest of the international community's view on Jerusalem's status.
The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, and according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages.

The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, and according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and until now all countries have maintained their embassies in Tel Aviv.
Jerusalem contains sites sacred to the three major monotheistic faiths - Judaism, Islam and Christianity.
East Jerusalem, which includes the Old City, was annexed by Israel after the Six Day War of 1967, but is not internationally recognised as part of Israel.
What did Trump say
Speaking at the White House, the US president said he had "judged this course of action to be in the best interests of the United States of America, and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians".
He said he was directing the US state department to begin preparations to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Despite warnings of regional unrest over any such move, the decision fulfils a campaign promise and appeals to Trump's right-wing base.
"Today, I am delivering," the US leader said, referencing the campaign pledge.
Recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital was "nothing more or less than a recognition of reality", he added. "It is also the right thing to do."
Domestically motivated
The president emphasised several times that he was delivering on a campaign promise, signalling that domestic politics was largely what motivated this controversial decision.
The announcement would have made more sense as part of a peace plan, but the White House is still drafting one. So the president spent much of the speech pushing back against criticism that he was prejudging his own peace initiative.
He insisted that the US was still deeply committed to facilitating a deal acceptable to both sides, and was not taking a position on the final status of the holy city.
That seemed to imply the Palestinian claim to occupied East Jerusalem would still be on the table in any negotiations. But his argument would have been more convincing to them if he had spelled that out, and if he had clearly stated that the end goal was two states.
Instead he said the US would support such a solution if agreed to by both sides - not the unequivocal endorsement the Palestinians were looking for. He didn't offer the Palestinians anything, and the speech came across as an endorsement of Israel.
What do Israel and the Palestinians say
In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was a historic day, and Israel was profoundly grateful to President Trump.
"Jerusalem has been the focus of our hopes, our dreams, our prayers for three millennia," he tweeted.
Abbas, the Palestinian leader, said in a pre-recorded TV speech that the city was the "eternal capital of the state of Palestine".
He earlier warned of "dangerous consequences" through a spokesman, a sentiment echoed by other Arab leaders, who said there could be unrest.
There were demonstrations in Gaza against the decision before it was announced in response to a call from the Islamist Hamas movement that runs the Gaza strip, local pro-Hamas media reported.
Hamas said that Mr Trump's decision would "open the doors of hell" on US interests in the region.
What does the rest of the world say
The US decision comes despite vocal opposition in the Muslim world, even among US allies.
On Tuesday Saudi Arabia's King Salman had said that the move "would constitute a flagrant provocation of Muslims, all over the world".
Demonstrations have already taken place in Gaza and outside the US consulate in Istanbul, Turkey.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said it was "a moment of great anxiety".
"There is no alternative to the two-state solution. There is no Plan B," he said.
In other reaction:
Prime Minister Theresa May said she disagreed with the US decision, which was "unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region"
French President Emmanuel Macron said France did not support the move and called for calm
EU chief diplomat Federica Mogherini voiced "serious concern"

Kandy SC show clear dominance
Defending league champions Kandy Sports Club successfully cleared another hurdle with their fifth win of the season when they beat CR&FC 28-12 on a rainy Saturday afternoon. It was horrible weather conditions at Longden Place. Under the rain, rugby almost becomes a different sport. You cant play with hands. The ball is greasy. Hanging on to that ball is very difficult. Coming out of the rucks and scrums the ball slips. So, everything in the game was different. It was nice to see CR & FC president Sriyan Cooray giving a big hand to the two teams along with committee members like former Trinity College hooker Janindha Dunuwille, prop forward Hamza Hassanally, Gayan Amarasinghe, Jak Daisz, Mano Jayaranjan and Ashan Ratwatte, a former Trinity College and Kandy SC captain.
On a wet and windy afternoon, out of the five games, this game was a little hard for the winners, they had to be happy with a one goal one try to a try at half time. This was due to the weather taking the upper hand of the game. Full credit to both sets of players who provided an enjoyable competitive game and stuck to their task despite the weather.
Though CR & FC lost there were some positives in their defence, they stopped the strong Kandy SC from scoring more than four tries. It was a big improvement since the last game for CR & FC they were close, but lacked the knowledge. It cost them momentum. There were a lot of positives, some of the loose play was good and they played some positive stuff, they really concentrated themselves.
Whatever said and done Kandy SC showed their commitment to a game plan. It was a case of pressure and defense combined with on-point tackling. If you bring the pressure and you dont tackle well, a shifty fly half or a hard-charging center can beat you, badly.
But with pressure and accurate tackling, you can nullify a dangerous backline, that is what Kandy SC did.
After looking somewhat shaky in the first quarter of the game Kandy turned things around in startling fashion to finish as winners.
They started on the front foot and were able to maintain their defensive shape, despite a couple of early missed tackles. The CR & FC side tried to exert some physical superiority as it bashed toward the line for several minutes. Kandy with their knowledge worked their backs to lead 12-5 at halftime.
The second half began with heavy shower and Kandy ran sideways and then straight ahead to collect12 points. With the wet conditions Kandy closed out the game by playing a patient game.
This was a memorable win for Kandy against quality opposition. They move onto the next game with great optimism on Saturday the 9th when they host Navy SC at 3.45 pm.

Lanka ranked 73rd for infrastructure development - IFC
Sri Lankas success in developing basic infrastructure such as a road network density of 98% is highest in highest in South Asia according to the Global Competitiveness Index in FY17.
Sri Lanka is ranked as 73rd out of 138 countries for infrastructure development making Sri Lanka an attractive destination for private investment.
The international Finance Corporation (IFC) which also highlighted this in their South Asian report says that Sri Lankas road transport infrastructure is concentrated in a dense network around Colombo. Of the 5 million vehicles on the road, only 11% are cars, with motorcycles making up the majority. Due to a 2010 policy to substantially reduce taxes on hybrid vehicles,
Sri Lanka is a global leader in the use of hybrid electric vehicles, which comprised 56% of all cars in the country in 2014. The government is pushing to improve fuel efficiency even further, aiming to upgrade its emissions standards to Euro III for diesel vehicles and Euro IV for petrol vehicles by 2018.
The Sri Lankan government is prioritizing a modal shift towards mass public transport. Traffic congestion can result in annual economic losses of $2.5 billionan amount greater than the annual investment in improving the countrys road infrastructure.
The Clean Air Action Plan includes a clear strategy to manage emissions from the transport sector to 2025 through urban mass public transport systems; a green freight transport system; and cleaner fuels, technologies, and practices.
Sri Lanka aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent in the energy sector and by 10% in the transport, waste, industry, and forestry sectors.
Sri Lankas Vision 2025, which outlines the governments plans for the economy to achieve upper-middle-income status, signals its intention to empower the private sector and attract domestic and foreign investment by reforming investment incentives, improving policy predictability, encouraging PPPs, and integrating SMEs into the formal sector.
Taking projects in the pipeline into consideration, IFC estimates an investment opportunity of at least US$ 326 million in Sri Lankas transport sector between 2018 and 2030.

Measures to build a stronger economy
My Departments mission is to achieve national prosperity through the development of the plantation industry. Primarily we seek the provision of incentives and other facilities to increase the yield of plantation crops. So the Governments recent Budget was important for the industries and products we oversee.
Tea is a vital industry for our country. It employs two million people directly and indirectly and is part of the crucial agricultural sector which employs 27 percent of Sri Lankas population. Our tea industry and production are renowned throughout the world and the Colombo tea auction is the single largest tea auction in the world selling around 6.5 million kilograms weekly.
At present Sri Lanka ranks among the worlds top ten largest producers and 7th largest exporter of natural rubber. Sri Lanka Rubber Industry consists of two closely independent sectors; the rubber plantation industry which producers raw rubber and high-value new product innovations in finished rubber goods. Presently, Sri Lanka produces about 153,000 metric tons of natural rubber annually.
Export income
The plantation sector has consistently been one of the biggest contributors to our export income. Yet, their quality of life has remained under par. We will facilitate the shift from the line rooms to a house and for which 25,000 houses will be provided in the medium term. So the Budget will improve the quality of life for the plantation sector.
This investment is only possible because of the measures my government has taken to build a strong economy. Some of those decisions have been hard, and tough measures have been put in place. But let me assure you, decisions are always taken in the best interests of Sri Lanka and its people. We are working to fix the mistakes of the past and building a stronger economy for a better future for all Sri Lankans.
Sri Lanka has come a long way from the dark days of Mahinda Rajapaksa  who governed only for himself, his family and cronies. The economy was a mess and Sri Lankans lived in fear for their safety.
So far we have built hundreds of thousands of new homes to ensure every Sri Lankan has shelter by 2025. We have given rights back to Sri Lankans and to the media to speak freely.
The cost of goods like fuel and gas has been reduced. My government has provided Rs 20,000 to pregnant women and increased salaries for public servants so they can make ends meet. We have restored Sri Lankas international reputation, bringing in 2 million more tourists and creating jobs.
Of course, there is still more to do, so that everyone can walk the streets safely, our children can get a good education, and basic food is affordable. The economy is central to everything we do. Without a strong economy, we cannot afford to pay for schools or hospitals or jobs or wages. A strong economy and good infrastructure will bring foreign investment and increase wages for all Sri Lankans.
Better Sri Lanka for the future
We have a proven record, a clear vision and the determination and strong leadership to build a better Sri Lanka for the future. In order to do so the economy is central to everything we do. Without a strong economy, we cannot afford to pay for schools or hospitals or jobs or wages. A strong economy and good infrastructure will bring foreign investment and increase wages for all Sri Lankans.
Recently we published a Budget to build a stronger economy. It was a Budget for the enterprise. Only this government has the knowledge and ability to fix our economy. And only this government is trusted by the international community to deliver a fair and just economy where foreign companies will invest. Only by sticking to our plan to strengthen our economy can we keep Sri Lanka on the path to a better future.

The public should be vigilant since there is a probability of the prevailing depression condition in the Bay of Bengal developing in to a deep depression within the next 24 hours, Meteorology Department Director General Sarath Premalal said.
When considering the atmospheric conditions, the deep depression may not develop into a cyclonic storm and therefore people need not worry about it. However, the fishing community should be vigilant as it is rather difficult to forecast cyclonic conditions, he added.
Premalal was addressing the media at the Disaster Management Ministry Auditorium yesterday. He added that the depression is currently located around 300 kms away from the Eastern coastal area of the country. It is gradually moving away from the country. However, the sea area may be rough and may experience strong winds.
The wind speed at sea may be around 90 to 100 km per hour and fishermen are requested to refrain from going out to sea. Similarly, there may be a strong winds in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces of the country, he said.
He added that wind speeds may increase to extreme windy conditions within the next 24 hours.
Considering the climatic and weather situations of the area, there is a threat of bad weather condition which will persistence until today. Weather condition may be normal by tomorrow, Premalal said.
He forecast thundershowers at a few places including in the Northern, North-Central, Eastern,Uva, Sabaragamuwa, Central and Southern Provinces and the Ampara District.
Strong winds can occur during thunder showers. Afternoon showers or thundershowers are expected at several places today.

MoU to scale up Youth Social Innovation Challenge
The Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to scale up HackaDev  Youth Social Innovation Challenge, recently.
Under this initial agreement, the UNDPs tried and tested social innovation hackathon  HackaDev will be further scaled up and implemented until the end of 2019. The programme is aimed at giving effect to the realisation of the vision of a digital economy in Sri Lanka and will put young people in the spotlight of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals at the national level.
The programme is a co-financed initiative between the Ministry and UNDP, working closely with the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, the National Youth Services Council (NYSC), and the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA).
HackaDev aims to create a sustainable platform for young people in Sri Lanka to come up with innovative solutions to effectively address development challenges faced by their community or in the country at large.
Following the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers for the initiative, the initial phase of the programme was implemented in the latter half of 2017, where following a public call for applications for the National Youth Software Competition, a total of 45 innovative teams participated in three clustered HackaDev events in Badulla, Matara and Jaffna. Subsequently, nine teams went through the first phase of incubation in Colombo and will now receive seed funding to further develop their ideas towards implementation.
Speaking about these teams, Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando said, I am amazed at the talent we have in Sri Lanka. You need to fail to win again. If you know the taste of failing, you know how it means to win. Never worry about somebody condemning your innovation. Keep going forward. I thank all the partners who have come together to create this platform for youth.
Moving into the years 2018 and 2019, the project aims to further create opportunities for more young people to ideate solutions for development challenges by increasing their leadership, entrepreneurial, and innovative capacities.

Since there were no murder charges against suspect W. M. Ariyapala, he could be acquitted.
Thereafter, the Magistrate and Acting District Judge acquitted Ariyapala and released him and said she would deliver her judgement on December 12 after studying the case report.

Nel Farms celebrates 75 years  of trusted 'eggcellence
Nel Farms celebrated their 75th anniversary in business at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel along with shareholders, family, staff, industry stakeholders and guests. The company took the opportunity to recognise longstanding staff members who have made outstanding contributions to the company.
Noorani Estates Pvt Limited, (Nel Farms) which was incorporated in 1942 with the objective of purchasing and managing tea, rubber and coconut estates, is a family owned business, which is now in its sixth generation consisting of 45 shareholders in total.
The origins of Nel Farms began in a coconut estate in Walahapitiya, Nattandiya, where the company decided to diversify into livestock. Nel Farms has since has grown from an estate driven poultry business. Due to the seamless demand for their products, Nel Farms kept expanding annually until poultry became its core business.
In 1975, Seven Hills Limited was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Noorani Estates Limited. Situated at the foothills of the Seven Virgins mountain range in Maskeliya. The focus was on poultry production, dairy farming and dairy food processing.
Noorani Estates Limited or Nel Farms as it is more fondly known is one of the largest poultry farming operations in Sri Lanka today. They were one of the pioneers in catering to the protein requirement of the whole nation by supplying clean, safe and high quality table eggs to the entire island.
Nel Farms is a fully integrated poultry business, consisting of breeder farms and hatcheries where they produce both commercial layer and commercial broiler day old chicks. The company is a registered feed miller and produces their own feed. All raw materials both Local and imported are carefully selected for the highest quality.
The quality of raw materials, finished goods and the health status its flocks are constantly checked through the companys well equipped laboratory.
Nel Farms carries out its own product distribution to ensure that the high company standards are maintained throughout the entire process.
In 2003 the company purchased 50 acres of land in Mangala Eliya which is located in the Puttalam District and began to expand its commercial layer operation to increase table egg production, in order to keep up with the growing demand.
The establishment of seven hills farm, nestled at the foot hills of the seven Virgins mountain range in Maskeliya further strengthened the sector in 2008 with the construction of a state-of-the-art commercial layer farm.
The company will continue to expand and is on a continuous search for suitable land, Nel Farms will continue to stay true to our vision of delivering innovation, health and nutrition through our products in the years to come," says Noordeen Sethwala, Director, Noorani Estates Ltd., adding, "The committed management team, experienced and skillful work force and usage of cutting edge technology assure the continuous development of Nel Farms."
Nel Farms is a responsible corporate organization that has a strong commitment to conserving the environment.
Nel Farms maintains its commitment to the environment at all levels of production. Manufacturing its very own paper pulp egg trays and cartons using waste paper is just one way in which the company achieves this goal.
The company has also invested in renewable energy with the implementation of a 1 mega watt roof mounted solar energy plant at its breeder farm in Walahapitiya. This has helped the company set a benchmark in Sri Lanka while minimizing its carbon footprint.
As Nel Farms celebrates 75 years, the company takes pride in being one of the largest producers of table eggs and day old chicks in Sri Lanka.

Nissan to trial robo-taxis in Japan
Carmaker Nissan plans to test self-driving taxis on Japanese roads from March next year.
The company is partnering with Japanese software company DeNA, which operates online services for the gaming, healthcare and automotive industries.
It will adapt a Nissan Leaf electric car, which passengers will summon using an app.
Nissan joins a growing band of carmakers trialling self-drive cars, including General Motors and Volvo.
The free trials will be held over a two-week period in March in Yokohama.
The Easy Ride system could be launched in Japan in the early 2020s. With more freedom of mobility as its concept, Easy Ride is envisioned as a service for anyone who wants to travel freely to their destination of choice in a robo-vehicle, Nissan said in a statement. The goal is to allow customers to use a dedicated mobile app to complete the whole process, from setting destinations and summoning vehicles to paying the fare.
Tokyo Olympics
During tests, there will be a staff member in the drivers seat to comply with Japanese law.
Customers, who can apply from now until 15 January, can select local destinations and sightseeing routes. Meanwhile, Japanese robotics maker ZMP is working with a Tokyo taxi operator to develop self-driving taxis for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

## Title: ORIGIN and EVOLUTION OF COCONUT PALM
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, December 7, 2017 - 01:00
ORIGIN and EVOLUTION OF COCONUT PALM
Anthropologists, explorers, invaders and travellers had made numerous references on the evolution of this versatile palm grown in more than 90 countries across the world.Some of these were mere theories based on assumptions yet to be proved scientifically. Extensive research is still continuing on the origin of the coconut palm on gene analysis by scientists.
Since time immemorial, the coconut plant has been found growing luxuriantly along the beaches of tropical countries. And certain scientists argue that coconut palm is not indigenous to any of those countries even if they grow there. Fossil remains of coconut up to 35 to 55 million years old have been excavated in Australia and India proving that coconut palm belongs to the Kingdom of Plants in the Prehistoric era.
EXPLORERS , TRAVELLERS AND INVADERS ON EXISTENCE OF COCONUT PALM IN SRI LANKA:
Historical records show that the Ambassador of Seleucus Nicator, Megasthenes in 300 B.C. reported to the Indian King Chandragupta about the existence of coconut palms in SriLanka.
In the 5th century the renowned traveler Fa Hien who spent a considerable period in Sri Lanka and conducted extensive explorations made references to the availability of coconut palms and coconut arrack in the island.
The Arabs who engaged in trade and commerce in the Indian Ocean and the European invaders namely the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British too paid keen interest to the coconut growing in Sri Lanka.
FIRST COCONUT CULTIVATION AT WELIGAMA ON THE SOUTH COAST:
The Great Chronicle Mahawamsa refers to King Aggabodhi-I who cultivated coconut land between Dondra and Weligama on the Southern coast of Sri Lanka in 589 A.D. King Parakramabahu the Second cultivated coconut in Bentota and Kalutara proving that royal patronage was given to coconut cultivation in the country.
COTTAGE INDUSTRY OF WOMEN FOLK IN THE RURAL SECTOR ON THE COASTAL BELT:
Today, the manual weaving of coir twine is the major livelihood industry of women on the Southern coast. Even though modern machinery has replaced manual weaving these women have not given up their traditional practices and to this day one can find entire families involved in the business of weaving coir twine. They earn their daily wages by selling products at the village shops or to the fibre mills.
Desiccated coconut, coconut oil, coconut water, copra, coconut milk powder, coconut vinegar, coconut honey and coconut arrack are some of the direct products from coconut. In addition the coconut fibre is used to make; mattress fibre, bristle fibre, twisted fibre, mixed fibre, bio-fibre, fibre pith, coconut husk, husk chips, coir yarn, coir twine and coir ropes. These are used for horticultural purposes, soil conservation  erosion prevention and water retention.
Geo Textiles, molded coir products, rubberized coir products, compressed fibre pith, carpets, rugs, mats, grow bags, coir dust, ornamental items, door mats and wall hangings are some of the other products from coconut. In addition coconut shells (charcoal) are exported to manufacture activated carbon.
Over 70 countries import coir based products from Sri Lanka and 90 percent of coir based items are manufactured in Asia for consumers in the US, EU, Canada, Australia, Japan, Middle East, Korea, UK, Netherlands and Germany.
FIRST DESICCATED COCONUT FACTORY:
According to Dr. P. G. Punchihewa, former Secretary to the Ministry of Coconut Industries and the Executive Director of Asia and Pacific Coconut Community, the first desiccated coconut factory was built at Dematagoda in 1890 during the British colonial period and the first coconut fibre mill was established in 1853 and a consignment of 2380 tons of coir had been exported from it. Dr. Punchihewa further stated that Sri Lanka was the first country to export desiccated coconut but since 2013 onwards the other coconut producing countries in Asia such as the Philippines and Indonesia; competitors to Sri Lanka managed to occupy the first and second positions in the world as coconut exporters. Sri Lanka lags behind in third place and the reasons for this are many.
The majority of coconut factory owners in the country have now paid attention to the manufacture of coir based products. According to them there is a competitive demand for products used in horticulture, agriculture and soil conservation.
The Information Officer attached to the Commercial Department of Coconut Development Authority, Nisanthi Fernando when contacted by Daily News said as of September 2017, the total foreign exchange earnings out of coconut based products amounted to Rs. 63 million.
Long before the emergence of large factories, brown coir industry was mostly found in the South of SriLanka and these smallscale coconut factories produced copra. The byproduct of the copra industry was coir pith and brown fibre.
COIR PITH  A WASTE MATERIAL BECOMES A MONEY SPINNER:
The coir pith in the past was dumped in coconut lands and water ways as waste material which then became a major environmental hazard. Huge mountains of coir pith dumped on river banks however prevented flood water during torrential rains. Fortunately, as a result of heavy demand for coir pith in the international market, the compressed coir pith now in various shapes is exported. Thus, a waste material in the past has become a money spinner in the present.
Coco Peat or Coir Pith is made out of coconut fibre and coir pith (coir dust) which could be obtained from the removal of the husk from a coconut. The coir pith thus obtained is considered as an environment friendly material. Both Grow Bags and Coco Peat are used in horticulture, as hydroponic system of planting and agriculture due its water absorbing qualities.
LACK OF MODERN MACHINERY:
Chameel Samaranayake one of the leading coir factory owners in the Coconut Triangle exporting coir pith products said, regional competition from other countries has become a major challenge encountered by Sri Lankan manufacturers.
Another impediment identified is non availability of modern high-tech machinery in the country for the manufacture of high quality coir based products. Almost all other countries engaged in producing coir based products including India make use of ultramodern machinery, he pointed out.
M. W. Zoysa, a small scale coir factory owner from the village of Randombe in the Balapitiya electorate said he started his factory in 1980. He possessed a husk removal machine, Torbo coir cleaner and twine machine. All machinery is electronically operated and a concessionary electricity bill is paid.
He sells coir products to large scale coir manufacturers and experiences difficulties in obtaining raw material. The buyers from Kurunegala are in the habit of collecting coconut husks for more than double the price.
Despite these issues, the solutions from the government are few and far between. The coconut industry which has much potential to expand is stuck at various junctures from the lack of technology to raw materials.
The coconuts however come into the limelight only when prices go up or when politicians in Sri Lanka whenever they are in the opposition continue to follow the unhealthy trend of breaking coconuts before Hindu Shrines as a way of vengeance and seeking the support of the God to come back into power.

February 10 presumed date for holding LG elections : Vajira
February 10 has been implied as the date of which the long overdue Local Government Elections would be held during Parliamentary debates yesterday.
This was indicated during a response by Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena to Joint Opposition MP Prasanna Ranatunga.
MP Ranatunga criticized appointments made to the Divisional Development Coordination Committees, stating that some of those committees were headed by rogues. He called on the Government to appoint responsible public representatives to take decisions pertaining to regional development.
Minister Abeywardena in response to this comment, said the problem would cease to continue after February 10 midnight.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath during the course of his speech called on the Government to revoke the circular to appoint a representative of the President or the Prime Minister to the District and Divisional Development Coordination Committees. This circular cancelled the 1997 circular. Now electoral organizers are appointed to head these committees. Some of them were defeated candidates, while some even had criminal charges against them. Public officials face problems when coordinating work with them, he said.
All issues faced by 332 DS divisions will be resolved in year 2020
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeygunawardena said measures would be taken to resolve all issues faced by the 332 Divisional Secretariat Divisions by 2020.
He said so in Parliament yesterday, joining the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 under expenditure heads of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Public Administration and Management Ministry and Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry.
We needed more funds than what was allocated in 2017 and the sum required was Rs. 28.53 billion. The entire administrative mechanism includes Divisional Secretariats, District Secretariats, 14,022 Grama Niladhari officers, 17,000 Development officers and 332 Regional offices, he said.
Noting that the government had to face several disaster situations, the Minister said the state mechanism had to be mobilised in order to face these calamities, adding that 5,000 Grama Niladhari divisions had been hit by the recent drought as well. Recently, another 27,000 houses in 130 divisional secretariats were also damaged due to inclement weather, while 14 lives had been also lost. However, we deployed our officers and handled the situation well, fulfilling our goals for 2017. We allocated Rs. 1.5 billion to amalgamate all 14,022 Grama Niladhari offices into one project Nila Sevana so that all offices could be brought under one central mechanism by 2020.
The Minister said issues at village level were resolved through the Presidents Nila Mehewara programme. This programme was launched to minimise village issues and he said accordingly, 18,000 Identity cards were issued in Galle under this project. According to Abeywardana, measures are underway to resolve the burning issues faced by the people in the Kurunegala district, while issues in Mullaithivu and Kilinochchi are also in the process of being addressed and resolved. He said in 2018, eighteen divisions will be targeted in the Jaffna district and the issues facing them would be systematically resolved. In the Kurunegala district, the minister said it had been discovered that around 80,000 persons are without identity cards.
Uma Oya project victims will be compensated soon:Anuradha
Mahaweli Development Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayaratne said measures would be taken to expedite compensation payments to all the victims of the Uma Oya project who had not received compensation so far.
He said this in response to a question posed by JVP-MP Vijitha Herath during the oral question and answer session in Parliament yesterday.
Dy Minister Jayaratne explaining the reasons for the delay said, Taking into consideration the past situation, over 1,400 litres of water had leaked per second. Although we conducted evaluations within a few weeks to a month, the situation changed dramatically. Later, we had to re-assess the situation. However, we have now succeeded in containing the leak to 280 litres per second and adequate officers have been deployed to conduct the assessments.
However, Herath while disagreeing, noted that he was on the sectorial oversight committee and he himself had summoned these officers on three occasions and these officers themselves have admitted that they were short-staffed and lacked sufficient assessment officers. He accused the government of not being committed to resolve the issue.In response, Jayaratne said a committee had been appointed to look into the problems, adding that so far compensation had been paid to 1,687 victims. He said a total sum of Rs. 521 million had been paid as compensation so far and assured that measures would be taken to minimise the water leak at the Uma Oya project.
Sewage released to sea sans purification, could be rectified under LG Ministry
The sewage system in Colombo that was released to the sea without purification, could be rectified under the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry, said Minister Faiszer Musthapha in Parliament yesterday.
He said that for the past 100 of years or so, it had been released to the sea without purification, creating an environmental hazard. He added that it was a success for his Ministry to correct it under this government.
He made these observations during the Committee Stage debate on Budget proposals for the financial year 2018 under the financial heads of Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry, Home Affairs Ministry and Public Administration and Management Ministry.
He also said that the local government elections were delayed not because of his fault, but due to the delay of solving the delimitation issue.
He further said that his Ministry could implement projects worth of Rs 40,500 million out of the Rs 45,000 million that was allocated to his Ministry for year 2017. He added that his Ministry could render a great service by developing many libraries under the Library Development Project. He also said that steps were taken to provide water to 8,405 hectare in the North from the Iranamadu Tank.
He also said that the Ministry is studying the powers of Local Governments that had been taken over by the Central Government in order to take them back.
He also said that although Sri Lanka could boast of the world's first woman President, female representation in politics had dropped. He added that however with amendments, the government had been able to increase women representation in Local Government Institutions to 25 percent. He expressed hope that female representation in Parliament would increase as well.
Pradeshiya Sabha issue would be resolved in a fair manner : Faiszer Musthapha
The issue concerning the separate Pradeshiya Sabha in Sainthamaruthu in Kalmunai, would be resolved in a fair manner for both the Tamils and Muslims, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha pledged.
He said the matter is now being extensively discussed with the TNA and Muslim political parties. He made this observation in Parliament yesterday, when JVP MP Vijitha Herath called on the Government to attend to the matter before it was too late.
However, MP Herath commented that the faith on Minister Musthaphas promises had lost due to the continuous delay of LG polls and that it led to the submission of two No Confidence Motions against him.
The minister who went to the area on October 21 last year, promised for a separate Pradeshiya Sabha for them. As you have ignited the problem, resolve it before it was too late, the MP said.
UNP back bencher Chaminda Wijesiri, who spoke after MP Herath, also joined in the criticism against Minister Musthapha over the delay in holding LG polls. You have already been dubbed Balagiri and the people in our villages would soon start pasting your photograph instead of mentioning Balagiri doshaya ada nevei heta. Please resolve the matter and pave the way for elections soon, he commented.
Secretarial Service needed for LG institutions : Dayasiri
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said a Local Government Secretaries Service should be initiated for Local Government institutions.
The Minister made this suggestion during the Committee Stage debate of the Budget 2018 under the expenditure heads of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Public Administration and Management Ministry and Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry, in Parliament yesterday.
He suggested that the Local Government Ministry should be able to work at rural level. Commenting on the numerous allegations the government is facing over the delay in LG elections, he said, The government has to pay Provincial Ministers around Rs. 60 million per month and a large sum of money is spent on Provincial Councils annually. A total of 8,356 members will be appointed through the election, but so far, no one has spoken on reducing the number of members and we will have to fork out a colossal Rs. 125,340,000 monthly. If we fail to stabilise power, then nothing would be done. If someone files a case, the blame would be dumped on us, but no one is highlighting the flaws in this system and the resultant crisis that it would create.
Public Service strengthened by more than 15,000 members
The present government has recruited more than 15,000 to the public service during the last two and a half years, although the Opposition charge that the government was attempting to shrink the public service, Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said in Parliament yesterday.
He also said that the previous government had increased the salaries of public servants by Rs. 2,500 only, while the good governance government had increased the salaries by Rs 10,000 during this short period.
He made these observations during the Committee Stage debate on the Budget proposals for financial year 2018, under the financial heads of Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry, Home Affairs Ministry and Public Administration and Management Ministry.
He said the present government had recruited 570 to the Administrative Service, while 6,193 were recruited to the Government Management Supplementary Service. "Altogether 15,000 had been recruited under this government," Minister Bandara said. "There was a shortage of 500 Accountants and it was filled. As there is a shortage of translators, applicants are less due to low salaries and we have decided to make their payments attractive."
Jayaratne, Musthapha lock horns over LG election date
Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Priyankara Jayaratne and Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapha yesterday, locked horns in Parliament, over functions they shared, while MP Jayaratne was the latter's deputy.
The argument cropped up when Priyankara Jayaratne queried as to when the Local Government election would be held, stating that the Minister was not competent to fulfill his duty.
They were embroiled in this argument during the Committee Stage debate on the Budget proposals for the financial year 2018, under the financial heads of Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry, Home Affairs Ministry and Public Administration and Management Ministry.
"You were my deputy when you were sitting with the government," Minister Musthapa said. "If the Ministry was not run efficiently, you are responsible for it." "Since I could not work with you I left the government side," MP Jayaratne said. "But making a statement on your resignation, you said that you were vested with ample powers by the Minister," Minister Musthapa said. "You said that you were given powers of a Cabinet Minister and it is immoral and unacceptable to say otherwise now."
However, the presiding member Sriyani Wijewickrama attempted to settle their disagreement but it lasted until the presiding member announced that the allotted time for MP Jayaratne had lapsed.
Translators will be placed on attractive salary scale : Ranjith
Translators would be placed on an attractive salary scale to address the dearth of translators in the country, Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said.
The minister made this comment when JVP MP Vijitha Herath pointed out that a shortage of translators existed in many public institutions including ministries. The MP also highlighted the lack of a proper mechanism to recruit graduates who have studied translation as a subject, directly to the cadre of translators in the Government.
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena proposed waiving the minimum qualification of Ordinary Level when recruiting Tamil translators as a solution to the dearth of Tamil speaking translators. However, MP Herath pointed out that graduates with translation as a subject, are passing out from universities every year, but there is no system to recruit them directly to Government service.
Minister Mudduma Bandara said translators would be placed on an attractive salary scale shortly after obtaining Cabinet approval.
Jayampathie on PCs under Central Government
Subjects of Provincial Councils that are under the Central Government unconstitutionally must be granted back, said UNP Parliamentarian Jayampathie Wickramaratne in Parliament yesterday.
He said all central governments have kept several subjects that come under provincial councils since its initiation and it was the responsibility of the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry to work to gain them back to the Provincial Councils.
He made these observations during the Committee Stage debate on the Budget proposals for the financial year 2018, under financial heads of Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry, Home Affairs Ministry and Public Administration and Management Ministry.
He said Provincial Councils have the power to run the Omni Bus Transport but the National Transport Commission Act has contradictory laws preventing Provincial Councils from operating them.
He added that all subjects that come under the Agrarian Services Act should also come under the Provincial Councils.
The Ministry has to take those subjects from the Central Government on behalf of the Provincial Councils.
SLAS retirement age should be increased
The retirement age for Sri Lankas Administrative Service should be increased to 62 years to acquire their operational and management skills, said UNP Parliamentarian M H M Salman in Parliament yesterday.
He also said that there were more than 60 such SLAS officers to go on retirement this year, which would create a lacunar in highly seasoned officials fighting for the upliftment of the country.
He made these observations during the Committee Stage debate on budget proposals for the financial year 2018, under financial heads of Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry, Home Affairs Ministry and Public Administration and Management Ministry.
He further said that there were 13 all island services where nearly 30,000 employed in these services and out of which 2,900 were SLAS officials. He added that although the retirement age of these SLAS officials was 60 years, the required retirement age has been amended. He also added that this situation had created an issue to the equilibrium state of the government service and suggested that the retirement age of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service be increased to 62 years.

Siddhalepa Group in LMDs Most Respected Edition for  sixth year
The Hettigoda Group made it to the LMDs prestigious special edition on Most Respected Companies for the sixth consecutive year, cementing their position as a market leader in Ayurveda Pharmaceuticals and Ayurveda based tourism.
The company established by Deshabandu, Dr. Victor Hettigoda, has achieved market leadership from a home grown ayurveda products manufacturer, championed by their signature brand Siddhalepa Balm and has maintained its ranking in an arena dominated by top blue chip conglomerates and multinational entities.
The ratings were based on; financial performance, quality consciousness, management profile, honesty, innovation, dynamism, corporate culture, CSR, Vision and National Mindedness and the Hettigoda Group won both a gold and silver this year.
The groups phenomenal success as an Ayurveda product manufacturer, and its business expansion using Ayurveda to promote medical tourism can be attributed to the vision, entrepreneurship and innovation of its founder, Dr. Hettigoda, known today as the Father of Ayurveda, whose pioneering efforts have brought the concept of Ayurveda from its roots in the villages to the heart of the city and transformed it into a global commodity.
Siddhalepa Group uses local plantation raw material, local and imported herbs and 100 natural products for their range of Ayurveda Health Products, cosmetics and dental products. In a world of changing consumer demands Siddhalepa capitalized on using pure natural and herbal ingredients with no chemicals in their range of bath, cosmetics and detergents challenging and eventually compelling even the FMCGs to add herbal ingredients to their mass produced consumer products. Good examples are top dental care brands and washing powders that has added herbal varieties to their range. Similarly with a vision far beyond his time, Dr. Hettigoda introduced the concept of medical tourism to Sri Lanka with Siddhalepa Ayurveda Resort Hotel in Wadduwa, built over 30 years ago and supported by the Groups Ayurveda Hospital in Mount Lavinia. Siddhalepa Group operates Ayurveda Centres in both their resort and city hotel and also in Ward Place, Colombo 7 and was the first company to open an Ayurveda Centre at the Colombo International Airport Lounge which they still operate. The group also operates Ayurveda Spas in some key European cities.
The award is also a salutation to its legendary founder and Chairman, Dr. Hettigoda whose has steered Siddhalepa from a small home grown Ayurveda Enterprise to a leading Ayurveda Based Brand in the Country, with Ayurveda Centres in Europe.
We have implemented systems to introduce new products every year, to give back part of our wealth for the welfare of the community and educate youth on social values, MD, Hettigoda Group, Asoka Hettigoda says in the Q and A on the company in the Special Edition.
We are honoured to be ranked among the Most Respected entities and consider this recognition as an impetus for growth. We hope to maintain this stature as we continue our growth to reach the pinnacle of success, he added.
Apart from product innovation and business expansion, the Group was recognized for its corporate governance and its significant contribution to environment protection and its green mission.
The company was initiating and promoting Corporate Social Responsibility activity at a time when the word was not even yet coined. The best examples of CSR is at religious sites,where the group set up First Aid Camps to relieve weary devotees with Siddhalepa massages and serve their refreshing herbal hot drink, Lak Peyawa. Other activities like branded name board signs, branded litter bins and send out a strong message about the Groups commitment in keeping the environment clean.

Attempt to send nine cricketers to India without approval
Sports Minister to initiate disciplinary action on official responsible
The Minister of Sports who is looking to initiate disciplinary action against the official responsible for sending nine Sri Lankan cricketers to India without prior approval from him, has called for a report and investigation into the incident.
Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said the official responsible would also have to personally bear the costs accrued due to the delay in flights.
Addressing the weekly cabinet briefing yesterday, he explained that all sportsmen and women have to receive approval from the Sports Minister prior to applying for visas to go abroad to participate in sporting tournaments. Procedure decrees that the relevant documents be sent to the Minister 21 days before departure.
Sri Lanka Cricket however, had only sent the names for approval on Monday evening whilst they were scheduled to leave on Tuesday. I am not prepared to break the law for a match, said the Minister. He added that even the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) president Thilanga Sumathipala was not aware of the nine players who were to leave for India.
As confusion reigned within SLC, the minister has appointed a Cricket Advisory Committee to prepare a five year plan to turn things around for cricket in the country. The first step would be a focus on improving the state of domestic cricket, said Jayasekara.
He stressed that in the eight years during which various interim committees oversaw cricket, the administrative structure and sport was crumbling from within, even though on the surface the team was winning a few games.
We called for elections and we had Arjuna Ranatunga and Thilanga Sumathipala run for elections. The former having lost has now got together with some former interim committee members and started to criticize everything that is done, he added.
Commenting on the team he noted that players like Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara occupied the top batting positions for many years with no steps taken to groom younger players.
There was a time when players like Roshan Mahanama would opt to occupy spots lower in the batting order to allow younger players a chance to bat at the top. I am not criticizing anyone, but today we dont have many strong batsmen in the team, the Minister said.
Discussions with the Advisory Committee has led to cricket being decentralized into four provinces. Each province will be given the facilities to develop local conditions to build a team of 20 players each. Thus, there will be a pool of 80 players at any given time to pick from for the national team thus developing competitiveness in the domestic cricket sphere, he said.
The Minister has also asked that the selectors at national level to explain to the media why certain players are dropped in order to minimize speculation over the selection process. The Minister who is also determined to change the SLC constitution and reduce the number of votes awarded to the clubs said he would persevere regardless of the opposition, Certain captains of the team are scared of the clubs, they are scared of their voting power as they look to join the SLC in future. I am not ready to listen to club owners and I have told the SLC to take all necessary decisions without fear. If they do not let things work, I will not hesitate to dissolve the SLC and call for fresh elections, he added.

One-legged Dhananjaya de Silva stands tall with century
Sri Lanka batting displays gumption to draw final Test
Wednesday: The Sri Lankan batting which has been spineless in the last five Tests against India finally displayed its true colours to bat out the entire fifth and final day and deny the number one ranked Test team victory in the third and final cricket Test played at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium on Wednesday.
Set an improbable target of 410 to chase in the fourth innings, Sri Lanka finished on 299 for five wickets to earn an honourable draw. The match was called off in mutual consent between the two teams at the final drinks break at 4 pm.
India however won the three-match series 1-0 having won the second Test at Nagpur. The first Test played in Kolkata also ended in a draw. It was a tremendous comeback by the Lankan team after suffering their heaviest Test defeat in history by an innings and 239 runs at Nagpur.
The hero for Sri Lanka was Dhananjaya de Silva who on his return to the Sri Lanka team hit a plucky century against all odds before he was forced to retire hurt suffering from glute tightness on his left leg with his score on 119. At that stage Sri Lanka were still not out of the woods so to say at 205-5 and 30 overs still remained to be bowled in the match.
It was left to Roshen Silva the debutant and Niroshan Dickwella to see Sri Lanka through with the second new ball that was taken an over before the tea break. With the spinners not getting any purchase from the wicket except the rough, Indias chances of winning largely depended on the second new ball for the breakthrough.
However, Silva who was out for a third-ball duck in the first innings and Dickwella negotiated it successfully and steered Sri Lanka safely towards a draw with an unbroken half-century partnership.
Silva batted stoically showing great determination and immense character to make the most of what has been a long journey for him. He made it this far into the Test team after being close to selection on several occasions and suffering the frustrations of not being picked.
At the other end, Dickwella playing his natural game, took his chances to remain unbeaten on 44.
Silvas contribution was 74 not out off 154 balls punctuated with 11 fours. He became the fourth Sri Lankan batsman to score a half-century in the second innings after being dismissed for a duck in the first on a Test debut. Roy Dias (0 & 77 v England, P Sara Oval, 1982), Athula Samarasekara (0 & 57 v England, Lords 1988) and Dimuth Karunaratne (0 & 60 n.o. v New Zealand, Galle, 2012) are the ones to have done so before him.
Sri Lanka certainly didnt have the luck they deserved for of all days at the start of play there was bright sunshine and it was a clear day unlike the fog filled previous four days.
India achieved an early breakthrough in the fourth over of the morning when Ravindra Jadeja had Angelo Mathews edging a delivery to Rahane at slip for one. Mathews and Sri Lanka were unlucky that umpire Joe Wilson of West Indies missed signalling the delivery a no-ball as Jadeja had clearly overstepped the crease.
Umpires always check the validity of a no-ball on fast bowlers when a batsman is dismissed but they have been rather lenient in the case of spinners thinking that they bowl at a slower pace and so they seldom bowl a no-ball.
Chandimal however was lucky on that count for when he was bowled by an unplayable Jadeja delivery at 24 the umpire had the sense to check on the delivery and lo and behold it turned out to be another no-ball.
Chandimal, given a reprieve, went onto score 36 priceless runs for his side and figure in a stand of 112 with De Silva before Ashwin beat him in flight and bowled him.
De Silva at the other end played a classy innings bringing up his third Test fifty off a fine on drive off Ashwin in 92 balls with eight fours and a six and continued to delight with some superb batting with pulls cuts and drives to complete a fine century off 188 balls with 13 fours and a six which even the Indian fielders including captain Kohli applauded.
It was a chanceless knock and only after passing hundred (110) did he show a hint of desperation when he launched into a drive and Ashwin failed to hold onto the hard return catch. By now De Silva was struggling with his leg and virtually limping and eventually was forced to leave the field breaking a 58-run liaison for the sixth wicket with Roshen Silva.
De Silva became the first Sri Lankan batsman in the last 10 years to score a fourth innings century in away Tests.
The last to do was Kumar Sangakkara when he scored that magnificent 192 against Australia at Hobart in Nov 2007.
Kohli was made Man of the Match for his double century and he also won the Man of the Series with an aggregate of 610 runs.
The two teams now commence a three-match ODI series starting at Dharamsala on December 10.

Sri Lanka to host Asian Packaging  Federation confab from Dec 10-14
Recognizing the necessity for international cooperation of packaging organizations of Asian countries, the representatives of packaging organizations in China, India, Japan, Korea and the Philippines met in Tokyo, Japan, in 1967 and resolved upon the formation of the Asian Packaging Federation (APF).
One nationally recognized leading packaging organization from each country in the Asia Pacific Region is eligible to be a full member of the APF except for the Peoples' Republic of China, the only country with two nationally recognized packaging organizations being given the opportunity to receive full membership of the Federation considering the total population of the country.
The Sri Lanka Institute of Packaging, the only body representing the Sri Lankan packaging industry joined the Asian Packaging Federation in 1978 during the time of the founder President of the Sri Lanka Institute of Packaging, Stanley Wickremaratne who himself became a Vice President in 1989 and later the 13th President of the Asian Packaging Federation in 1991 and 1992 and subsequently become a Vice President of the World Packaging Organization.
The member organizations of the APF meet once a year in one of its member countries in rotation hosted by the executive member organization in that country.
The Sri Lanka Institute of Packaging got the opportunity of hosting the 14th APF Congress along with its meetings of the Board of Administration, General Assembly, judging of Asia Star contest and its 20th anniversary celebrations in Colombo in 1987 which was the first international packaging event that was held in Sri Lanka hosted by the Sri Lanka Institute of Packaging.
Subsequently, the APF had its board meeting and related events in Sri Lanka on two other occasions - in 1986 and 2003.
The Board of Directors of the APF at its last meeting in Mumbai took a decision to have the official celebrations in Tokyo, Japan, in 2018 as the inaugural meeting of the APF was held in Tokyo 50 years ago.
Conducting the APF events in Sri Lanka this year is of great significance to the packaging fraternity in our country as the incumbent President of SLIP, Rohan Victoria who is the senior Vice President of APF is expected to be elected as the next President of the Federation and will assume duties from January 1, 2018. Victoria will be the third person from Sri Lanka to adorn this prestigious position as the President of the Asian Packaging Federation.
Out of the member organizations of the APF from 16 countries, around 30 delegates from 9 countries in the Asia Pacific region excluding Sri Lanka have already registered to attend the annual events this year to be held at the Galadari from December 10-14.
This year's events include meetings of three working committees, judging of Asia Star Awards Contest. The meeting of the Board of Administration and the General Assembly of the Federation is scheduled to be held on December 13. The grand finale of these events will be the Asia Star2017/Lanka Star Awards Presentation on December 13.

Sri Lanka Prosperity Index up
Prosperity, measured by the Sri Lanka Prosperity Index (SLPI), which is a composite indicator that measures and compares the level of prosperity of the country and across its provinces, improved to 0.746 in 2016 from 0.685 in the previous year.
In analyzing the movements of the sub-indices of SLPI, for the period of 2015 to 2016, the economy and business climate and well-being of the People sub-indices have improved, while there is a moderation in Socio-Economic Infrastructure sub-index.
The improvements in employment rate, informal sector wages, industrial density and banking density have contributed towards the enhancement of the Economy and Business Climate sub-index.
With regard to the sub index of the well-being of the people, high performance in availability of healthcare facilities, availability & quality of education, wealth of people and availability & usage of entertainment facilities were the key drivers.
The reduction observed in the Socio-Economic Infrastructure sub-index was led by reduced levels of pipe borne water quality, female participation in civic activities and available transport facilities.
However, the aspects of road coverage, availability of electricity, crime free environment and availability of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) facilities in schools have shown improvements within the Socio-Economic Infrastructure sub-index. The SLPI and all its sub-indices demonstrate increasing trends over the last five years.
The steep growth observed during 2012-2014 period has moderated thereafter due to low performance recorded in the Socio-Economic Infrastructure sub-index.
The Western province remained at the leading position recording the highest value of 1.272, for the overall prosperity index, with an increase of 0.029 index points compared to 2015.
In comparison to the other provinces, the high performance of the Western province was driven by maintenance of higher standards in all three sub-indices.
Except for the Sabaragamuwa province, all other provinces recorded higher overall prosperity index values during 2016 compared to the previous year.
The overall prosperity index of the Sabaragamuwa province has declined due to the moderation in the Socio-Economic Infrastructure sub-index, partly driven by the impact of the 2016 floods on water quality and other socio-economic variables.
The Eastern province, although remained at the same level in the provincial ranking in 2016, recorded an increase of 0.072 index points in the overall prosperity index with enhancements in all three sub-indices.
The highest increase of 0.082 index points in the overall prosperity index was recorded from the North Western province.
The provincial rankings of the nine provinces in terms of the overall prosperity, remained unchanged from 2015 to 2016.

Sri Lankan housemaids in Saudi return with salary arrears
Two Sri Lankan housemaids who had returned home after several years of employment in Saudi Arabia empty handed after being denied their due salaries by the respective employers have received their arrears of pay amounting to Rs. 3.6 million following the intervention of Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Atukorale. They received their cheques from Minister Atukorale at the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment on December 5.
The two housemaids are Ramiah Parameshwari (54), a mother of two from Bopitiya, Deltota, Peradeniya and S. P. Muruheshwari. A press release by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment said Parameshwari had left for employment in Saudi Arabia on December 20, 2007 after obtaining SLBFE registration. From the time of employment the owners of the residence she had worked had denied her due salaries and any contact with her family back home.
Minister Atukorale who learnt about her predicament had directed officials in the Sri Lankan Embassy in Saudi Arabia to ensure that she is sent back to Sri Lanka and paid her back wages by the employer. The embassy officials who intervened in the matter had brought her back to the embassy along with her salary arrears amounting to Rs. 2,039,111 and sent her back to Sri Lanka on November 20, 2017.
Murugeshwari had gone for employment in Saudi Arabia as a housemaid on December 18, 2015 and worked at a Saudi home for one year and ten months. The house owners had not only denied her due salaries but harassed her at every turn entrusting her with heavy work.
The tormenting experiences undergone by her had been so acute that she had escaped from her tormentors thrice but she had been brought back and handed over to the same Saudi home by the Police. After escaping for the fourth time, she had visited Mecca and the Saudi Police which arrested her had handed her over to the Sri Lanka Consul General's office in Jeddah. When the Consul General's office threatened to file legal action against the employer, they had paid 23,000 Saudi Riyals as back wages and 20,000 Saudi Riyals as compensation. This amounted to Rs. 1,636,536.
Speaking at a ceremony held to mark the handing over of their cheques, Minister Atukorale said, 166 Sri Lankan workers who could not be traced after going for employment during the last two years had been identified and brought back to Sri Lanka along with salary arrears amounting to Rs. 76,475,089.

Starc, Hazlewood lead Australia to second
Adelaide: Pacemen Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood spearheaded Australia to a crushing 120-run win over England to open up a 2-0 lead in the five-Test Ashes series in Adelaide on Wednesday.
Hazlewood snuffed out England's outside hopes of a come-from-behind victory when he dismissed captain Joe Root in the third over of the final day of the first-ever day-night Ashes Test.
Starc mopped up the tail to finish with five for 88.
Holders England now face the prospect of losing the series in next week's third Test at Perth's WACA Ground where they have not won a Test since 1978.
"We always had the faith in the team and the belief," Australia skipper Steve Smith said.
"We thought if we could come out and bowl well this morning, hit our lengths and get one or two wickets then things can happen quickly."
While Root was batting England's hopes lingered of bringing off a record run chase of 345 at Adelaide Oval.
But Hazlewood enticed a bottom edge and wicketkeeper Tim Paine did the rest to the unrestrained glee of the Australian team.
Root left the field on his overnight score of 67 and with him England's hopes vanished.
"Disappointing. I don't think we did ourselves justice," Root said.
"We're still massively in the series. We showed that from the way we played yesterday.
"That has to be the benchmark how we approach the rest of the series."
Nightwatchman Chris Woakes was out to the second ball of the day, caught behind off Hazlewood for five.
Woakes sought a review and while the 'Hot Spot' infrared imaging system could not find anything, the 'Snicko' sound-video technology detected an edge and the umpire's decision was upheld.
Nathan Lyon got the wicket of fellow off-spinner Moeen Ali for the fourth time in the series, leg before wicket as he attempted to sweep when on two.
That left England lurching towards defeat on 188 for seven after 45 minutes of play on the final day.
Craig Overton stayed around for 39 minutes before he fell lbw to a Starc inswinger for seven with the first delivery of the second new ball.
Starc had Stuart Broad caught behind for eight and finished off the Test just before tea bowling Jonny Bairstow for 36.
England entered the final day 178 runs from victory with six wickets in hand after a dramatic momentum switch on Tuesday. AFP

Tall hopes on polls
They maybe elections that select representatives to the lowest tier in the political arena but the local government elections that are now due created a huge controversy which seems to have resolved last week- although more legal twists and turns cannot be ruled out, even at this late stage.
After much jostling and jousting between major political parties, there was a general consensus that the elections would be held in February next year. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe announced at a public meeting in Bingiriya that the polls will be held in the first week of February but said the exact date of the elections will be decided by the Elections Commission.
Chairman of the Elections Commission, Mahinda Deshapriya was even more specific, stating that the elections would be held on or before February 17. There is a consideration for the elections to be conducted on a Saturday because it would avert the loss of a working day and its detrimental effects on the economy, Deshapriya said.
Deshapriya called the elections historic, not because of the legal disputes that have overshadowed it but because this will be the first instance when the entire country selects local government representatives on one day. Displaying his characteristic wit and alluding to the ongoing controversies in cricket, the charismatic former Elections Commissioner said that the match can be played if the pitch is ready, the two teams are ready and the toss has taken place but added that it could be stopped if there was smog.
That the elections have been finally decided on must come as a great relief to some political parties but it is no secret that the process had to undergo several convulsions because of the rivalry between the mainstream Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and its breakaway faction, the Joint Opposition (JO) which in its new incarnation will appear as the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).
Reunification talks
Initially though, discussion was driven by a section of the mainstream SLFP which was keen to contest the polls along with the JO. This move was spearheaded by Minister Susil Premajayantha. This is not a new role for Premajayantha. It will be recalled that in the lead up to the August 2015 general election, Premajayantha, who was then the General Secretary of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), was instrumental in the UPFA contesting those elections as one entity.
Premajayantha was responsible for accommodating many loyalists of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in the UPFAs nomination lists, including that of Rajapaksa himself for the Kurunegala district. It was a move that prompted President Sirisena to make an unprecedented address to the nation declaring that even if the UPFA emerged as the single largest party at the polls, Rajapaksa would not be appointed Prime Minister.
This time around, Premajayantha was again the prime mover in the reunification talks. However he had the blessings of President Maithripala Sirisena to do so. It has been argued that these discussions were the result of genuine concerns expressed by President Sirisena who didnt wish to be seen as presiding over an irrevocable division of the SLFP. The Presidents critics - many of whom are in the JO - contend that the talks materialised because there was a concern in the mainstream SLFP that they would be relegated to the third place in some local government divisions.
The former theory gained credence when several petitions were filed in the Court of Appeal challenging the gazette notification related to elections issued by Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha. This led to the JO and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) submitting motions of no-confidence against Musthapha in Parliament.
Even as the mainstream SLFP and the JO were trading accusations about the conduct of elections, the Elections Commission emerged with what amounted to a fait accompli: it was going ahead with polls to 93 local government bodies, on the basis that these were unaffected by the re-demarcation process and as such, were not affected by the stay order in the Court of Appeal.
Musthapha then successfully negotiated the withdrawal of the petitions filed in the Court of Appeal, leading to the announcement of the polls by the Elections Commission. Now, the stage is set for election in February, but the SLFPs internal travails continue.
In what could be seen as a pre-emptive move, SLPP candidates submitted nominations for several local government bodies, even while discussions were still underway with the SLFP. This was seen as a show of strength from the SLPP, signalling that they are serious about contesting elections on their own steam. Of course, had SLFP-SLPP talks succeeded, the latter always had the option of withdrawing their candidates from the election.
However, the dialogue between the SLFP and the SLPP failed for an entirely different reason: the SLPP was insisting on the SLFP withdrawing from the government. While this may have been an alluring prospect for the SLPP, it was not good negotiating strategy.
Ministerial portfolios
If the SLFP withdrew from government and its parliamentarians joined ranks with the JO on the opposition benches, it would still be in a minority, with only 95 seats. Even if it had plans to entice some parliamentarians from the United National Party (UNP), they would have to engineer a crossover of some 18 UNP (or other party) MPs to secure a working majority in Parliament. While it is common in Sri Lankan politics for opposition MPs to join the government in return for ministerial portfolios, why would MPs already in government join another, rival party where they would be viewed as outsiders
On the other hand, if the SLFP withdrew from government, it would be much easier for the UNP, which is already in government, to invite eight MPs to secure a working majority in Parliament. Given that the 19th Amendment to the Constitution now prevents the President from dissolving Parliament at his whim, President Sirisena would then be a prisoner in a totally UNP government. It is easy therefore to see why the negotiations between the SLFP and the SLPP stalled and then fell apart. Ironically, this has led to reparations between the SLFP and the UNP following discussions between President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. Shortly after these discussions, Wickremesinghe was to instruct his MPs not to be critical of the President while the two parties also agreed not to attack each other during the election campaign.
The confusion in the SLFP however continues. Minister Premajayantha was to re-iterate this week that reunification talks between the two factions were still ongoing. The SLFP has not abandoned efforts to unite the two factions of the party and talks were underway in various ways to achieve this, Premajayantha said. Some ministers are talking to the media without knowing what is going on behind the scenes. We have not given up our efforts, he noted.
JOs double standard
However, days later, in what seemed to be remarks countering Minister Premajayanthas claims, Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, addressing a media briefing at SLFP headquarters, said that the SLFP will win the election even without former President Rajapaksa. How can the JO members request the people to cast their vote to the SLPP while sitting in Parliament SLPP is a political party which has been created to destroy the SLFP, Samarasinghe remarked.
In a final twist to the tale, on Monday, a former member of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha filed a fundamental rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an order to prevent elections being held to the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha. In his petition, he has stated that the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha had been divided into three Pradeshiya Sabhas (Norwood, Ambagamuwa and Maskeliya) and that this would lead to ethnic clashes. He claimed that this demarcation had affected the ethnic composition and in the process, rights of Sinhala Buddhists had been violated.
Whether that would lead to yet another postponement of the polls remains to be decided by the highest court in the land. In any event, it is unlikely to affect more than 300 other local government institutions- and the elections that will be held will be first test of popularity for the UNP, mainstream SLFP and the SLPP in two years.

A taste of Japan
Japanese may not be the first topic that comes to mind when you think of studying a foreign language. However Ravindu Ishadh Wickramasinghe has proven that there are a great many reasons to master the language. The 17 year old has won a two year scholarship to engage in further studies in Japan. He has gotten this unique opportunity after winning first place at the 7th Kake International Speech Contest which was held at Okayama University, Okayama, Japan on November 17.
Ravindu competed against 14 competitors from 10 different countries like Australia, China, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia etc. Ravindu had to make a speech on the topic If my one dream come true. The speech needed to be five minutes long. Competitors between 15 to 21 years took part in the event.
For Ravindu the Japanese language is his forte. A student of Trinity College, Kandy, Ravindu has started learning the language around five years ago when he was a grade seven student.
I have always been fascinated in foreign languages. The Japanese language particularly interested me because I wish to engage in higher education in Japan, Ravindu said.
He notes that Japanese is not easy to master. This is because there are three alphabets and around 2000 letters to grasp.
However Japanese grammar is similar to that of the Sinhala language. The written language kanji is inherited from Chinese, Ravindu explained.
The ability to communicate in another language has long been regarded as an essential element of a well rounded education. Language and communication are at the heart of the human experience. Therefore more and more youth are keen to learn one or two more languages other than their mother tongue.
Before venturing to Japan for the international competition Ravindu had to take part in the 7th Kake Trophy Speech Contest held at Sri Lanka Foundation Institute, Colombo. The event was organized by the Sputnik International Education Centre, Kurunegala, together with the Japanese Embassy in Sri Lanka. Around 50 competitors from schools across the island took part in the event. This is not the first time the youth had taken part in the event. He had been a contestant in the 6th Kake Trophy Speech Contest held in Sri Lanka last year.
Speaking about his experience at the 7th Kake International Speech Contest Ravindu noted that he did have a few butterflies in his stomach when he had stepped up in front of the audience to make his speech.
However I had a feeling that I would win. That premonition came true when they announced the winners. I was simply elated, he enthused adding that it is one memory that would stay with him forever in his life.
Apart from displaying his skills Ravindu has been able to interact with his competitors and learn about their countries and cultures. Going along with the age-old wisdom that to even begin to understand a culture, you need to understand the language, Ravindu has already built a link with Japan through speaking their language fluently. He has also gotten an insight into Japan and its culture  a place he would call his home during the next couple of years, through his visit.
Language is not only a means of contact with other human beings, but it also develops more individuals with strong skills.
Ravindu says that a person needs to be passionate about learning Japanese, have knowledge about the Japanese lifestyle and have good guidance to master the language.
My ambition is to become a doctor someday and I believe that learning Japanese is advantageous for the profession, he mused adding that sometimes certain things are just expressed better when theyre not in English. Youll find there are words in Japanese with a totally different flavour than their English counterparts.
Ravindu is also passionate about making handicrafts. Japanese calligraphy too captivates him. He is a gifted Kandyan dancer and has had his Ves Ceremony in 2015. He has toured the Philippines and Indonesia with the school dance troupe.
Ravindus parents, Ananda Wickramasinghe and Rasanjali Dassanayake are both retired teachers. He has two brothers and one sister. He is currently getting ready for his G C E Advanced Level examination in BioScience. He wishes to thank the Trinity College Japanese teacher V R Kumari and Sputnik International Education Centre for helping him attain this victory.
If you try, you can do anything. Set your goal and reach for the stars, is his message for other youth who wish to pursue their hidden talents.

With the intention of developing the Walasmulla town, ancient buildings and shop buildings were demolished in 2007. Now, even seven years later, no development work has yet been initiated, former Walasmulla Traders Association Chairman Sisira Jayasinha said.
He said that the roads in the town limits are so narrow that two vehicles cannot pass each other at a time. Meanwhile, Walasmulla Pradesheeya Sabha Secretary P. Nambukarawasam said that the construcrtion work of the weekly pola is underway, but the construction work of the bus stand has been curtailed for reasons undisclosed. But the traders of the Walasmulla town said that there are no proper health and sanitary facilities in the town's limits. There is no drain complex in the heart of the town, and as such, the entire town gets inundated during heavy rains. There is also no proper water supply system. Hence, traders and consumers are the worst affected. Fifty three Grama Niladhari divisions of Katuwana, Weeraketiya, and Okewela come under the purview of Walasmulla, the traders said.

Warm praise for Sri Lanka from ICAO Director
His bespoke white tunic was his gesture of oneness with an island people with whom he is clearly enthralled.
It is the warmth of your welcome, said, Boubacar Djibo, Director, Air Transport Bureau, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), who was in Sri Lanka for the annual ICAN conference taking place in from December 4-8. You dont feel like a foreigner here. From the time one boards your airline SriLankan, to when you land in the airport, to arriving at the hotel and even at business meetings and on the road in a tuk tuk, one feels a sense of welcome.
ICAN is the ICAOs premier annual international conference bringing together delegates from all over the world to one single meeting place for negotiations of air services agreements aiming at either updating existing traffic rights or creating new arrangements for market access among ICAO members.
Around 500 delegates from 75 states are participating at this years conference, lending host country Sri Lanka the rare opportunity to showcase its attractions to exclusive guests. Endorsing the islands hospitality as a huge plus factor in leveraging tourism, Djibo said that Sri Lanka was also chosen as the venue of this years conference because the country has demonstrated a clear vision for aviation. We were here last August (2016) for the regional conference of the directors general of civil aviation at the Hilton and at that time Sri Lanka was studying the prospects of global connectivity, of unlocking the benefits of its ports and airports and were seeing the results this year.
Sri Lanka has demonstrated how a state can benefit from aviation; this was clearly evident from the speeches of the Minister of Transport and the Chairman of Sri Lanka Tourism Bureau which endorsed a liberal aviation policy and increasing tourist arrivals from 2 million to 3 million.
Recent hosts to the ICAN conference were tourism hot spots such as Jamaica, Antalya Bali and Durban. We also chose Sri Lanka because the country is an important member of the UN, but also because the conference venue rotates from region to region and South Asia is strong in tourism.
Countries which are strong in aviation can be strong in tourism and vice versa, Djibo said, because you need a clear aviation policy to encourage tourism and when a state has demonstrated that it welcomes foreigners, then other states are eager to reciprocate with traffic rights.
Todays consumer wants global connectivity, Djibo said, citing the ever-growing e-commerce market as the perfect example of how important aviation is for trade and commerce. Take Amazon or Ali Baba, for instance. It is the air transport industry which enables the shipping of flowers or diamonds. Now you even have drones delivering pharmaceuticals. Whatever the business, most often you would find that aviation is needed.
Last year, aviation accounted for 1% in volume of international trade but 35% in value, Djibo said, adding that the air transport industry not only accounts for carriage of people, but contributes to international trade, the best outcome of which is unleashed when there is connectivity between a states ports and airports.
Underlining the need for connectivity in the global framework, he said connectivity is needed at domestic, regional and internationals. He lauded the sea plane facilitate which ferried him to on a visit to the Mattala international airport. My first sea plane ride, he said. It was impressive.
Djibo applauded Sri Lanka for opening up its market to take advantage of an increasingly inter-connected globe.
Everywhere traffic is growing, he said. Low cost carriers are plentiful and there is a new way of travelling; the passenger today wants cheap fares and doesnt need much comforts. He wants shorter holidays several times a year. He said therefore there is a need for more freedoms of air, codeshares and alliances among airlines. Djibo reiterated that aviation could have beneficial impact on all sectors creating value and creating jobs. He however, said that the UNs SDG goals underscored all development and as such ICAO stood for sustainable initiatives, whether in tourism or international trade.

Determined to win back ODI place after being left out
We came with a positive mind to win  Chandimal
Wednesday: Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal said his teams approach on the fifth and final day of the third Test against India was to try and win the match and square the series at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium here on Wednesday.
We didnt come to draw the game, we came to win. Thats why we changed our approach in the middle. If we had come to draw the game definitely we could have lost it, said Chandimal after Sri Lanka had denied the number one ranked Test team victory by playing out for a honourable draw.
Sri Lanka left a target to 410 to chase finished on 299-5 after resuming at their overnight score of 31-3. India won the three-match series 1-0 with their victory in the second Test at Nagpur. It is the highest fourth innings total by a visiting team to India beating the 276-5 by West Indies in Delhi in 1987. That match the West Indies won.
It was a really good series apart from the second game. After the second game we sat down as a team especially with the batting unit we discussed how to get our approach right for the third match, explained Chandimal.
Before the third Test we had two practice sessions and what we put in at practices we finally executed in the middle and delivered when we went to bat out today. I am really happy that after the second Test the way we batted in this game.
It was Chandimals first innings career best century 164 coupled with Angelo Mathews hundred that gave Sri Lanka some breathing space to put up a good fight to India. In the process of scoring 36 in the second innings Chandimal became the fifth batsmen for the calendar year to pass 1000 Test runs after Cheteswar Pujara, Dean Elgar, Dimuth Karunaratne and Virat Kohli.
Talking of the tough conditions they had to undergo in the first four days with players falling ill by inhaling the air pollution, Chandimal said, It was a tough time for us as a team. We are not used to this kind of conditions in Sri Lanka, you wont get this much pollution but we need to play the game at the same time. So after the first two days we had a discussion with the team and said we need to forget about the conditions and play the game. Thats what everyone did. We learnt how to face such situations in the future.
We got so many youngsters for this series and we have a really good attitude. If that is there the best results will come. If you have players with bad attitudes you wont get good results. Thats what I am looking at from this team. With good attitude and discipline we can move forward with this team, he said.
Commenting on the performances of Dhananjaya de Silva and Roshen Silva, Chandimal said, It was a really good innings from Dhananjaya. We picked him after the West Indies A team tour where he played some good innings. We had to trust playing him at no. 3 and he also brought us a bowling option as well. He took his opportunity with both hands.
It was tough to leave out the vice-captain (Lahiru Thirimanne). Its a tough call. Dhananjaya and Roshen deserved to take the opportunities especially Roshen. Hes scored more than 6000 runs in domestic cricket, he played in the A team and scored heavily. Both deserved their places. Its unfortunate for Thirimanne.
Chandimal said that he was determined to regain his place in the one-day team after being left out for the upcoming three ODIs against India.
I got enough matches in ODIs against Pakistan where I didnt perform well. I like to play ODIs because I know I can do far better. I am working hard on my game especially in ODIs. I need to change some of my technique and I will use the time on my hands to become a good ODI player, Chandimal said.

Wet and slippery  weekend of rugby
Life in paradise can be a lot more than just your perfect existence..especially when the weather turned on our much anticipated rugby season. Wet and muddy conditions underfoot meant that teams who adjusted better, to the rain and handling the slippery ball stepped up with a reasonable alternative for the duration.
Fundamental to performance in the middle is sharper thinking and careful handling, not only is it tough for the threes to indulge ...but tougher for the forwards to grip and control upfront and at the breakdowns.
The results speak loudest and teams grateful for a mud soaked, injury free finish by the 80 mins full time.
Hopefully Kandy will be happy for some sun on their backs ...good to see them stick to their basics and patiently grind away at a resilient CR ..for a good 70 mins. CR are also strapped in with injuries. That give their bench more emphasis. Omalka G ..hamstring and desperate to play..needs to be fully fit to open up defences..Wise for them to line up the likes of Noor etc...for consistency in the boiler house.
Kandy have structured their skills to outplay all comers, matching the Reds pound for pound ...and in the extreme rain water/mud adjust, did splendidly well to win the sets......scrum and lineouts tough and graft to survive.
Ruck ball was the call and don't let the Reds rip it off us ..aggressive in the mauls..walk and talk ...
Great match to watch despite the weather ..and the defending champions, closed it down with a Weeraratne/Ranjan try that epitomized the skill and efficiency available on demand ..
The skipper kicking a low ball inside his own half ..lands inside CR 22m ...as the ball gets stuck ..Ranjan at speed dives into the mud ..slides 10m ..grabs the ball ..continues to slide another 15m over the line for a clinical try that was supreme to clock ..elegant skills perfectly adapted ..impeccable finish..untouched.
Udangamuwa, the no 8 for Kandy..owned Longdon Place ..was sharpest to the breakdown and led his forwards like Vikings sacking a village ..nothing was left to chance ..and the W at the end ..24/12..stamping their class this season.
It remains to be seen and a decent wager on Navy and Havelocks to stall their progress and outplay Kandy in the 1st round ...if it's possible or not is nervous goose bumps for our resident pundits and experts ...those armchairs must be lonely places and nowhere to park the crystal ball
Navy struggling all the way against Air Force ..only managed a 10-nil win and much concern for the coaching staff about adaptability and thinking under pressure.
CH will be kicking themselves for the 3rd week running ..having given their opponents early Christmas presents and only their own thinking to blame. Wins against Army, Havies and Police on the cards ..and would have put them in the top 2 ...with plenty of opportunity to strike at the top.
But reality is harsh ..and a 21-all draw, a touch too tough to accept for their 80mins grab and tackle at Police Park.
CH need to be a lot more positive, trust their skills and step up to be clinical finishers ..points on the board is mighty.
Emphasis on hard work around the park and contesting everything on the deck absolutely vital to their cause ..let's keep one eye open for their 1st round finish and improved levels to surprise teams in round 2.
Havelocks cruised to 29 points v Army and deserved to be no 2 in the table ..plus a good chance that their backs are starting to stamp some authority in the middle , but without Dixon to add more dimension to their running game ..life will be tough for Dulaj, Sandun coming back from injury and Dabere still off his A game.
Nevertheless watch out for their ability as a team to bite back..and with Rahul de Silva in good nick at 9, back from university in Australia, the base looks solid with Dulaj at 10, the options certainly line up for coach Martis to be creative under pressure.
Beating Army by 29 points ..and plenty to shout about last Saturday....plus lots more happiness and sauce at their clubhouse in Havelock town...the strains of happy vocals wafting across Pedris Park and over the basketball facility towards the seafront.
The hype and hot air about needing to constantly upgrade muscle kilograms, energy levels and performance... is certainly more fashionable than designer aftershave...each gym a waterfront advertising lightbox for supplements and all sorts.
Rugby players massive fashion victims desperate to carry more muscle and impact in the middle ..bigger, better, faster ..the siren call!
Unfortunately there is so much mileage from Hollywood to Bollywood and across the ocean to sunny Sri about how these chemical powder enhances everything Professor Arjuna as the authority to keep sport clean and Dr Seevali with his anti doping team are in the front lines to save our emerging generation of hugely impressionable players and teams.
This is a national problem and should be given priority and funding to have proper advise and legally acceptable WADA cleared supplements for athletes. The argument is about individual rights and no fuss if you are not a national or 1st class representative player.
Huge fuss if you are capped for your country..and tested positive for banned substance etc ..
I hesitate to stand up on my eco friendly soapbox ...but when you hear how much emphasis and investment schools are indulging...the mind boggles and I shudder at the chemical mix in the kids blood and irreversible damage to multiple organs etc ..
Parents and responsible officials must be guided and advised ..the gremlins are too harsh to combat and lethal consequences as you step forward. The nation and governing bodies need to address and arrest it's progress sooner rather than later.
Weekender.
Saturday 9th: Air Force v CH 4pm Ratmalana, Kandy v Navy 4pm Nittawela, CR v Havelocks 4pm Longdon Place.
Sunday 10th: Navy v Police 4pm venue not confirmed.
If you are travelling or prefer to veg at home ..the game is on line live with the papare.com, plus stats etc ..Certainly a handy companion to rely on.
That's the wrap this Thursday, hope you ready the mind and contemplate the possible odds for a team to beat Kandy in round 1 and shock the pundits who lurk knowingly .....till that full time roar, we live in great anticipation
Blessings islanders..step up step strong
Cheers to all!

Women are naturally  fitter men!
Women are naturally fitter than men, new research reveals. Females process oxygen 30 percent more efficiently than their male counterparts, a study found.
Quick oxygen uptake is a measure of fitness and associated with a reduced risk of muscle fatigue. Study author Professor Richard Hughson from the University of Waterloo in Ontario, said: We found that womens muscles extract oxygen from the blood faster, which, scientifically speaking, indicates a superior aerobic system.
Lead author Professor Thomas Beltrame added: While we dont know why women have faster oxygen uptake, this study shakes up conventional wisdom.
The researchers analyzed 18 healthy, active adults, half of which were men and the remainder women.
All of the studys participants completed four moderate-intensity treadmill tests.
Their heart rate and oxygen tissue content were assessed, as well as the difference in oxygen levels between their veins and arteries being investigated.
Shakes up conventional wisdom
Results reveal women process oxygen more quickly than men when exercising.
For unclear reasons, females are around 30 percent more efficient at processing oxygen than their males counterparts.
Quick oxygen uptake is a measure of fitness and associated with a reduced risk of muscle fatigue.
Professor Hughson said: We found that womens muscles extract oxygen from the blood faster, which, scientifically speaking, indicates a superior aerobic system.
Professor Beltrame added: While we dont know why women have faster oxygen uptake, this study shakes up conventional wisdom.
It could change the way we approach assessment and athletic training down the road.
The findings were published in the journal Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism.
