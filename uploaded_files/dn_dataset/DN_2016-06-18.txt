Two unbeaten sides vying for the league plum
The inter school Division-1 Singer league rugby title decider has finally boiled down to between the two unbeaten teams in the tournament Isipathana College and S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia at CR & FC grounds, Longden Place today. Kick-off is at 4.30pm.
The two teams secured their eighth successive wins last week with Isipathana coasting to a hard fought 28-14 victory over Royal College Colombo and S. Thomas inflicting a second defeat on Science College Mount Lavinia, thrashing them convincingly by 31 points to nil.
This decider is also the final second round fixtures of the league tournament and it is expected to turn out to be a blockbuster with Isipathana coming with their heads high after their win against Royal and S. Thomas redeeming their prestige with a morale boosting win over Science.
Whatever the outcome the massive crowd that will throng to witness the game will have their moneys worth with no quarters asked or given in the ding dong battle for league supremacy.
Incidentally the way all the teams have performed in the league to-date, Isipathana stands way ahead of the rest to clinch the league title.
Since both teams are unbeaten its going to be a cracker of a match, said Isipathana head coach Nilfer Ibrahim.
This Thomian side is different as they are a balanced unit unlike in the past. Those days they were good only in their forwards. Our loss to them in the 7s final early in the season made us to be more determined. Weve changed our game plans and patterns of play in the league. It has given us a huge advantage and a confidence booster, he said.
We have been in the finals almost every year so we know how to adjust in a big game. Its nothing new to us but for the Thomians they have come to the league final after a lapse of 16 years, hence they will be under pressure for sure.
We will go out there with confidence and win the prestigious league trophy and bring it back to our backyard, said Ibrahim confidently.
Thomian head coach Tevita Tulagaese Laga said that he was confident of repeating their success in the inter-school Sevens and win the League title as well.
This match with Isipathana should be a good one and the boys will go out there and play well while enjoying the game, said the Western Samoan master tactician.
Im 200% certain that we have a very good opportunity to win and bring back the league crown that has eluded from us for the 16 years, he said.

Indian cricketer faces probe over lion selfie
AHMEDABAD, Friday  Forestry officials in western India have ordered an inquiry after cricketer Ravindra Jadeja posted several photos on social media of him and his wife posing with endangered Asiatic lions.
Officials from Gujarat state's Gir wildlife sanctuary ordered the probe late Thursday after photos showing the couple in front of a pride of lions during a safari earlier this week went viral on social media.
The Gir National Park and Sanctuary is a protected area and people are not supposed to get down (from) their vehicle during safari, a chief forest conservator A.P. Singh told AFP.
Since it is against the rule to get down (from) the vehicle in jungle, we have ordered a probe into the matter, he said, adding that the penalty would be determined after investigation.
In one of the photos on Instagram, the left-arm spinner is seen smiling and pointing at a pride of big cats resting behind him with a caption family photo, having good time in Sasan (Gir).
Another is a selfie of Jadeja and his wife as a lion looks on in the background.
The photos were taken just days after the Gujarat forestry department advised tourists and locals against taking selfies with lions, following a spate of attacks in which villagers were killed or injured by the cats.
Gir forest is a popular big cat safari destination and the only place where Asiatic lions remain in the wild.
Asiatic lions, slightly smaller than their African cousins and with a fold of skin along their bellies, have been increasing in numbers in Gir, with 523 recorded in the latest census.
The Asiatic lion was listed as endangered in 2008, up from being classified as critically endangered in 2000, after numbers improved in the forest. AFP

FINA to probe latest Russian doping claims
LONDON, FRIDAY: As Russia staged a last-ditch bid to overturn a doping ban currently barring its athletes from competing at this year's Olympic Games in Rio, swimming authorities called for relevant evidence following fresh allegations that Russian swimmers had also been caught up in a similar scandal.
Friday saw the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) governing council meeting in Vienna to decide whether to readmit Russia, first banned in November after a bombshell report by a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) independent commission that said there was state-sponsored doping and mass corruption in Russian athletics. Before that meeting started, a joint newspaper investigation by Britain's The Times and Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine was published alleging that two men at the centre of Russian doping revelations in athletics were said to have offered to exempt the country's swimmers from drug-testing in return for an annual fee.

Football great Pele receives Olympic Order
SANTOS: Pele, regarded as the greatest ever football player, was honoured with the Olympic order by IOC President Thomas Bach on Thursday at Santos, Brazil.
Pele, and for that matter of fact, Brazil have never won an Olympic gold medal in football. But the 75-year-old once jokingly said that it was because he never played in the Olympics.
In the 2012 London Games, Brazil were beaten by Mexico in the final. And in the 2008 Beijing Games, they finished third. They were also the losing finalists in 1984 and 1988.
IOC President Thomas Bach was visiting the Pele Museum in Santos, ahead of 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics in August. The Olympic Order is the highest award of the Olympic Movement and is awarded for particularly distinguished contributions to the movement.
