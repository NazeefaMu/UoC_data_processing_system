Path to common currency for South Asian region
A top investment banker in Bangladesh stressed that countries in South Asian region should reduce tensions between borders, build trust and engage with the people to successfully realise the vision for a common currency for South Asian region.
Currency unification will eliminate exchange risk and uncertainty and thereby promote inter-country trade and investment, Rafiqul Islam, MD and CEO of Green Delta Capital Bangladesh told the third edition of Islamic Finance Forum of South Asia, held in Colombo on Tuesday.
Noting that common currency is a worthy goal and a characteristic of strong regional economic integration, he said that it is the responsibility of policy makers and leaders in respective countries to put this idea into practice without any further delay.
He also stressed that respective leaders should also pay due attention to capitalize on many common features shared by countries in the South Asian region.
This is the only region in the world, which has a lot of common features, especially on political, social, economic and cultural fronts. Unfortunately, South Asia is the least trade activated area in the world, he said

Pipeline residents get new homes
New homes were granted to illegal residents near the pipeline which carries fuel from the Colombo Port to the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminal Ltd (CPSTL), Kolonnawa. CPSTL is taking measures to lay a new 12-inch pipeline. New homes were granted to 20 residents as the first step under the patronage of Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga and Parliamentarian Ravi Karunanayake yesterday.
Although there is a court order to evict them, the Ministry looked into the welfare of these families, the Minister said.
He also confirmed that they will give new homes to other residents too.
All of you lived on top of the pipeline. If there was a fire in the pipeline, it would have been disastrous. The court has issued an eviction order. If this happened during the previous regime, they would have evicted you overnight. But our government does not follow that kind of policy. We have taken steps to grant new homes to you for the well-being of your families, he said.
This pipeline is around 70 years old and needs to be replaced. We could not lay a new pipeline for 20 years. Now we can lay the pipeline without causing unfairness to residents, the Minister said. Parliamentarian Ravi Karunanayake said they will grant homes to 419 more residents before the end of this year.

Qatar opens visa centre in Kotte
The Qatar Visa Centre was opened at Sri Jayewardenepura, Kotte recently.
Having a Qatar Visa center in Sri Lanka will facilitate the work procedures of Sri Lankan expatriates migrating to the State of Qatar and also preserve and protect their rights via application of best practices benchmarked with international standards, said the State of Qatar ambassador in Colombo, Dr Rashid bin Shafea Al- Marri at the inauguration of the first Qatar Visa Centre in Sri Lanka.
It will also encourage Sri Lankan tourists to travel to Qatar. The ambassador said Qatar Visa Centres will be commissioned in eight more countries in the next few months.
Colombo was chosen as the pioneering country because of the friendly relationships. Many advantages in the project include, facilitating and speeding up the procedure of recruiting expatriate workers, protecting their rights, documenting employment contract and speeding up his/her work immediately upon arrival in Qatar, he said.
Information services for visa applicants are offered in English, Arabic, Sinhala and Tamil at multiple touch points as regards appointment scheduling, requirements and procedures.
The visa center equipped with state-of-the-art biometric enrollment and medical test facility is monitored and observed by the authorities in the State of Qatar.
Within 24 hours the whole process with regard to visa issuing will be completed which is the USP of this service.

Ranil - A mission successful
The government was engulfed in a controversy over an alleged attempt to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and its handling of the matter left much to be desired, damaging relations not only between the constituents of the National Unity government, the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) but also between Sri Lanka and its giant neighbour, India.
It was last weeks Cabinet meeting and subsequent media reports about the discussions that ensued at that meeting that led to the controversy. Although a website had also reported on the issue, it was a report in the mainstream Indian The Hindu newspaper that led to the crisis.
The Hindu reported that President alleged there was a conspiracy by the Indian intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (better known as RAW) to assassinate him. In a report by its correspondent Meera Sirinivasan, The Hindu stated that Mr. Sirisena told Ministers that the Indian intelligence agency was trying to kill him, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi may not be aware of the plan, quoting sources present at the discussion.
The report in The Hindu alluded to an Indian national arrested in connection with an alleged plot to assassinate the President and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. The local inquiry into that alleged plot is ongoing and is regularly attracting headlines in the national media.
The Indian national must be a RAW agent trying to kill me. The Indian PM may not be aware. That is often the case. Trump may not be aware of the CIAs similar moves, The Hindu report said and claimed it spoke to multiple sources in government - across political parties - who attended the meeting, and they confirmed this.
Indo-Lanka relations
Following the publication of this report, the government was left to deal with its fallout with the future of Indo-Lanka relations at stake. As a result, there was a concerted attempt to redress the issue. The very next day, Indian High Commissioner in Colombo, Taranjit Singh Sandhu called on President Sirisena and was assured that Sri Lanka did not suspect any involvement of the Indian government in an assassination attempt.
Issuing a statement after the meeting with the High Commissioner, the Presidents office explained what transpired at the Cabinet meeting. In the meeting, the President emphasised the need to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the alleged assassination plot, the Presidents Media Division said and added that President Sirisena did not mention any involvement of an Indian intelligence service in an alleged plot to assassinate him.
Thereafter, with the intervention of High Commissioner Sindhu, the matter was dealt with at the highest level of government. The President personally spoke to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi by telephone for about 20 minutes where there was a free and frank exchange of views to ensure that there was no misunderstanding in New Delhi.
That all this happened on the eve of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes visit to India was a co-incidence. That visit had been scheduled previously. Had the damage control exercise in diplomacy not been undertaken, the Prime Minister would have had a challenging time explaining what transpired in Colombo. However Premier Wickremesinghes visit to India was a resounding success and the body language between the two leaders suggested that there was no ill-feeling as a result of the hullabaloo in Colombo.
However, Prime Minister Modi had expressed concern that Indian projects in Sri Lanka were not progressing at a brisk pace. Mr. Narendra Modi has expressed his concern over the implementation of Indo-Sri Lanka joint development projects in accordance with the MoU signed between India and Sri Lanka in 2017. Mr. Modi said he was not satisfied with the response he had received from the Sri Lankan government to his overtures, a statement issued at the conclusion of the Wickremesinghe-Modi meeting said. Interestingly, this statement was issued not by Prime Minister Modis office but by the Sri Lankan Premiers office.
If it was thought that this was the end of the saga, subsequent events indicated otherwise. This is where the government could have acted to nip another looming crisis in the bud. Instead, it still appears to be a dispute gathering momentum. At stake are the growing differences between the UNP and the SLFP.
When the controversy over the alleged assassination attempt was still making headlines, Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe told the media that four ministers who divulged the story to The Hindu should be investigated and exposed.
We have no intention to press journalists to reveal their source. But it is quite obvious that certain cabinet ministers have given this false information to the media. The government must go to the bottom of the false propaganda and expose the four Ministers who misled the media, Samarasinghe declared and alleged that this was done deliberately with the intention of creating a misunderstanding between Colombo and New Delhi.
Differences of opinion
These remarks must be viewed in the context of the tensions that existed between the UNP and SLFP factions at the time. It was known that there had been differences of opinion between President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe at the Cabinet meeting. This also received wide publicity in the local media.
Around the same time, President Sirisena moved to remove the directors of the two major state banks- Bank of Ceylon and National Savings Bank- and the Board of Investment. This saw retorts from UNP ministers. Minister Lakshman Kiriella opined that this should be a function of the minister concerned while Minister Malik Samarawickrema lamented that the directors of the BOI were very competent professionals who were committed to serving their country.
If anything, Minister Samarasinghes remarks were seen as a thinly veiled reference to UNP ministers. Thereafter, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera joined the chorus. He ratcheted the rhetoric a notch higher by claiming that the ministers who are alleged to have leaked Cabinet proceedings had links with RAW, the Indian intelligence agency.
Now, Joint Opposition (JO) parliamentarian and son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Namal Rajapaksa has continued the debate. If some Cabinet ministers are in the pay list of the RAW, it is a national issue, it is the responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister to expose them, Rajapaksa said.
If the President went to great lengths to convince Indian leaders that there were no concerns about the involvement of RAW in Sri Lanka, the statements of ministers Samarasinghe and Amaraweera defeats that very purpose. It only achieves the objective of needling the UNP but it comes with a price tag- that of losing credibility with Indian authorities.
It is no longer a secret that the President has been keen to appease the JO and Rajapaksa faction of his party who are demanding that he acts decisively against the UNP. However, the manner in which the drama regarding the alleged assassination plot has played out has not been to the Presidents advantage.
The real test for the UNP-SLFP alliance will be when the Budget is presented and voted on next month. That will provide a better indication about how much of the current hype about a possible JO-SLFP alliance for the next national elections is real. It will also provide an insight into whether there is still a prospect of the UNP-SLFP coalition lasting until then.

The reading  habit
The power of man resides in his mind. The limbs, the fingers and the clever thumb are all slaves of the mind, which thinks and plans. Mans conquests over nature tell us about his great powers of mind. How did he make himself glorious among all the other creations
Man conquers by knowledge. His acquiring of knowledge by probing into matters makes him supreme.
We have read about many conquerors like, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Nepolean etc. They set goals and achieved them. Thorough knowledge about the world they made their dreams come true. We can be a conqueror if we learn more and more from our teachers and books. Knowledge is gained by asking, searching and learning.
By reading books we can develop a positive mind. We can know all about art, religion, culture, literature, scientific discovery and technological invention and become more alive to the world of knowledge. The habit of reading great classics enriches us, ennables us to enhance out good qualities, and makes us an effective part of a great heritage.
What kind of books can elevate our nature Interpretation of great scriptures, classics and literature, autobiographies of great men, history etc. are some themes which can guide us to a noble path.
Young minds get corrupted by reading trash. The temptations to read violent and vulgar books should be overcome. When we read a classic, we are in communication with a great mind and get a moral contentment. Let us make reading a regular habit and so become a creative member of the world community.

Service of the church in the Northern Province
The church has a proud record of service: people have been educated and refugees looked after  it is a proud witness to the immutable message that God loves each one of us.
St. Lukes Church, Tharmapuram, three miles towards Mullaitivu from Paranthan, is a community that was formed when many Tamils came flooding there to escape the 1956 riots.
With the shortage of priests, I remember my father finishing Sunday mass at St. James, Nallur, and rushing there. This beautiful community was destroyed in 1990 during the war when the Church precincts and the school in front were bombed. Over 1,000 children ran out of the school, but the bombing continued.
Now the community has come back. They need rebuilding. The Army had occupied the church.
A region known for Christian service
Rev. Dr. Sam Muttuveloe, the son of a Jaffna priest, medical doctor and now Anglican priest in the UK, had persuaded UKs Hope Outreach to build a new church. They did it for Rs. 20 million. October 18 is St. Lukes Day. The Bishop of Colombo, Rt. Rev. Dhiloraj Canagasabey came to decommission the old church and consecrate the new. Christians from all over  the UK, Colombo and Jaffna  were present. St. Lukes, Borella, donated the new altar.
I accompanied Rev. Fr. S.S. Jebachelvan, Vicar of St. Pauls, and enjoyed the fellowship. It was refreshing to mingle with the poor and to feast on tasty vegetarian lunch with the buffalo curd that Tharmapuram is uniquely famous for in the Northern Province.
However, even in peacetime. Rev. Canon Julian Reindorp of Hope-Outreach who came to Tharmapuram insists his driver was under 60 kmph when ticketed in a 70 kmph zone. As a priest, he could not pay the Rs. 300 to take care of it. Now the driver has to pay the Rs. 1,000 fine and return to the area to get his licence back, or spend days in court and on thousands of lawyers.
Missionary contributions
The Paranthan area got much-needed missionary service. Miss. Muriel Hutchins, my mothers teacher at Chundikuli Girls College, was a CMS Missionary with an Oxford degree. Upon her retirement at age 60, she returned to the UK, felt out of place there after a lifetime in Jaffna, and hastened back to found Karunanilayam for unwed mothers, and St. Pauls in Kilinochchi. She was an icon there till her death after some 30 more years of service. She took up citizenship. When she wanted to vote while bed-ridden and feeble with age, men carried her to the polling station.
Sister Elisabeth Baker, MBE, a British missionary from a wealthy family came at age 29 in 1931 and after 20 years in the Eastern Province, came to Jaffna. Pooling their meagre resources, says Neville Jayaweera, she and Rev. A.C. Thambyrajah built Navajeevanam in 1959, on 10 acres of land, as a farm for disabled children. She taught the boys, cycling everywhere. I too spent some time there teaching her adopted son Rev. Mahendran for his GCE O/Ls.
Gurukularajah Thambyrajah is perhaps from one of the last line of missionary families serving there. His father, Rev. Thambyrajah, literally left everything and took his wife and young sons to the then malaria-infested wilds of Paranthan. Gurukularajah, their youngest son, stayed with the poor during the war serving as Principal, Director of Education, and later as Provincial Council Member and Minister.
That rare sense of camaraderie was visible when Gurukularajah was seen seated on the floor with the choir, accompanying it on his guitar, during the commissioning service.
Navajeevanam continues after it was handed over after the war to the Methodist Church which revived it.
Arumuham
The story of Arumuham is not atypical of the residents of Tharmapuram. I got to know him when seated next to him during lunch. He came from the hill country, fleeing the violence and married a local woman from Neduntheevu. During the war, he went to Colombo on business and got stuck there. In his absence, his wife had come under the care of the church. She got baptised. On his return, she persuaded him to accept her new faith. Their son is employed in the state sector and his wife holds a managerial position in the Bank of Ceylon. When I asked him for his name, he said Arumuham with a laugh, adding, It is a Hindu name, but I am a Christian.Arumuham is a regular worshipper at St. Pauls.
State schools in Jaffna
Paranthan is rising, but Jaffna Going by figures obtained by a Jaffna Municipal Councillor, there are 99 education zones in the country of which the Northern Province has 12 with 983 schools. Schools with a primary section number 878. These schools presented students for the Grade 5 Scholarship Exam from the Northern Province this year. Not one student from 458 schools passed the cut-off mark. A total of 18,363 students appeared for the Grade 5 Scholarship Exam. Of these, only 2,240 passed the cut-off mark.
From the wealthiest Jaffna zone, of 2,789 students presenting from 92 schools, 537 had passed the cut-off. They represented 45 schools. That is, from the remaining 47 schools, not one passed the cut-off. From Valihaamam, 124 schools presented 2,606 students. Fifty-nine of these schools had only 309 students who passed the exam.
From the Islands Zone, 54 schools presented 612 students. Only 21 schools had students passing and these numbered 35. From the famous Vadamarachchi Zone, 73 schools presented 1,505 students. Only 47 schools had anyone passing. These numbered 206. In Thenmarachchi, 54 schools presented 876 students. Only 101 students from 54 schools passed the cut-off. That is, 25 schools failed to have even one student passing.
In Kilinochchi district, there are 104 schools with a primary section. Ninety-four schools presented 2,752 students. Sixty-eight schools together had 306 students who passed the exam. Mullaitivu district has two education zones. From the Mullaitivu Zone, 55 schools presented 1,589 students. Thirty-three schools had 218 passing the cut-off mark. Thunukaai Zone has 61 schools. Of these, 58 schools presented 829 students. Fourteen schools saw 34 students succeeding.
Mannar district seems the worst in the North. Madu Zone has 52 schools. Of these, 39 presented 493 students. Fourteen schools had 27 students succeeding. In the Mannar Zone, there are 88 schools. Eighty-three schools presented 1,809 students. One-hundred-and-three students from 26 schools passed the cutoff.
In Vavuniya District, from Vavuniya South Zone, 79 of the 96 schools presented 2,296 candidates. Forty-five schools had 327 students who passed the exam. From the Vavuniya North Zone, 63 of the 76 schools presented 655 students. Nineteen schools had 47 students passing.
In summary, of the 878 schools in the Northern Province, 458 schools failed to produce even one student passing the cut-off mark.
Take-over of mission schools
The take-over of mission schools, I think, is a disaster.
In the Northern Province, the exodus of the educated is compounded by reduced birth rates. There were 20,506, 19,090 and 18,363 in the years 2016, 2017, and 2018 respectively. In contrast the numbers for Mullaitivu, Vavuniya and Mannar have remained steady.
The Northern Provincial Council played political intrigue, seeming to show that nothing can be done with PCs. The Education Ministrys allocation to the Northern Provincial Council for school expenditures was reassigned because estimates were not put forward.
Some details in rupees are Vaddukoddai Hindu College  Rs. 1 million, Ilavalai St. Henrys  Rs. 25 million, Urumpirai RC School  Rs. 12 million, Kilinochchi Ramanathapuram Vithyaasaalai 14.5 million and Vallipunam School  Rs.10 million. Kilinochchi GA Suntharam Ariyanayagam was furious at a development meeting in Jaffna. He promised to spend the money even if there is no approval. Mullaitivu GA Rupavathy Ketheeswran responded that if Ariyanayagam could do it, so could she. The Ministry has promised not to take the money away if estimates can be submitted by January. It is precious money for the most destitute areas. Did Northern Provincial Council politicians care
The neglected status of the North is best summed up by what National Languages and Social Integration Minister Mano Ganeshan said after he allocated Rs. 400.77 million just for the North East out of his ministrys total allocation of Rs. 850 million, and this was returned by the Northern Provincial Council without submitting any estimates: I am one of many who fought for the NPC. Now I am eagerly awaiting the day its term ends. (The term of office of the Northern Provincial Council ended yesterday.)
Lawlessness by Northern officialdom
When I returned from Tharmapuram, I was aghast to see the front part of my old school across our home turned into a Heritage Centre. The Board declared that it had been opened by the Chief Minister who should know the law.
The Assisted Schools and Training Colleges (Supplementary Provisions) Act No. 8 of 1961, Section 7 reads:
Property vested in the Crown may be used for the purpose of a school.
(1) Any property vested in the Crown by a Vesting Order may be used by the Director for and on behalf of the Crown for the purpose of conducting and maintaining a school. The provisions of the principal Act shall not apply to a school so conducted and maintained.
(2) Where, at the date of the Vesting Order in respect of any property, that property was used for any religious purpose by any religious body which is the owner of any place of public worship, abutting, or situated in the immediate vicinity of that property, the Director shall make available to such body the use of that property for that purpose during such hours as that property is not required for the educational and extramural activities of that school, but shall not permit the use of such property for any religious observance or worship by anybody other than the body which at the date of such Order was the owner of that property.
The Churchs Teachers Training College is the Zonal Education Office. My Practising School by its side is now the Heritage Centre. It has some 30 students. So it becomes a government office. Similarly the Methodist Church in Vembadi has the office as a shrine room.
We who insist on devolution and the observation of the law by the government, must stop bashing minorities in our midst. The law demands the return of these schools to the church.
After I wrote to the Bishop Canagasabey, he raised it as a concern with the Minister who has agreed that if any vetted school is not used for teaching, it must be divested. Could a Tamil Chief Minister not understand what a Sinhalese Minister can

A simple life
All our prophets tell us to lead a simple life. A life of a simple person is more pleasant than the life of rich people. Simple life says the prophet Mohammed, Set my heart on high thoughts.
It is a good thing that so many people in Europe, America and elsewhere have, during the recent years, come to see how much more pleasant and sensible the simple life is than one, which is given over to much spending, much show and much vanity. Men and women who have enough money to buy expensive things waste their riches by buying things they dont even want. They enjoy luxurious clothing and adorn their houses with rich looking furniture. People who work hard are the best servants of humanity. They live in a quiet frugal manner which keeps them in better health and enables them to take more active part in the worlds work.
I consider it a sin to waste money on personal pleasures. Whoever, spends too much on luxury is wasting money which can be used for the feeding, clothing and maintaining of his or her poorer neighbours. We should make our functions simple and on all important occasions we should remember the suffering humanity, and give a part of our money to charity. Great people have taught the value of austerity by living a simple life. It would be nice to develop courage to lead a simple life and determine to do good work.

SLASSCOM AI Asia Summit on Nov. 7
The Sri Lanka Association for Software and Services Companies (SLASSCOM) is to announce the first-ever SLASSCOM AI Asia Summit to be hosted at The Kingsbury, on November 7 from 8:30 AM  5:30 PM.
This is Sri Lankas first conference dedicated to the topics of Data Science and Machine Learning with many acclaimed international and local speakers addressing the latest developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) across application, research and adoption.
Key international speakers include Timothy Kooi, Head of Data Analytics at DHL Asia Pacific, Dr. Yasantha Rajakarunanayake, Senior Director Technology at MediaTek, Dr. Adam Easton, Chief Executive Officer at SimCentric Technologies, Dr. James Shanahan, Founder and Principal of Boutique Data Consultancy, Dr. Rukshan Batuwita, Data Scientist at Google, Dr. Chrisantha Fernando, Senior Research Scientist at Google DeepMind among others.
Jeevan Gnanam, Chairman SLASSCOM in his vision for an AI Nation, identified Sri Lanka as the island nation that punches above its weight in many categories and the need to add Data Science and AI to that list. He further said, Sri Lanka for the last two decades has relied on two main pillars for its IT/BPM export; that is Software Development and Finance & Accounting. This strategy has served us well as we grew 23% CAGR year on year for the last decade. However, times are changing. As a middle-income country we need to shift gears and look at increasing the diversity of our export-based basket of goods while climbing up the value chain. Its time to introduce a new pillar, one that offers exponential gains, the third pillar of Data Science and AI as this provides Sri Lanka with the opportunity in the next few years to lay the solid foundations of being an important thought leader in the South Asian context.
Jeevan Gnanam said that Sri Lanka should strive to replicate these solutions as exports to other similarly placed developing countries. This provides Sri Lanka with the opportunity once again to move beyond providing labor arbitrage solutions to becoming a true, value-added knowledge provider for clients and stakeholders.
The AI Asia summit will be a catalyst for this vision and raise awareness across industry, government, universities and private institutions of the opportunity ahead and what must be done now, in order to make this a reality. This event will culminate with the release of a Proposed AI Policy which will outline Sri Lankas vision for the next five years. Im elated to find so many Sri Lankans who are leading the research and development efforts of corporates and technology companies in the Data Science, Analytics and Machine Learning space, Gnanam said.
SLASSCOM is also pleased to host Dr. Yasantha Rajakarunanayake at AI Asia 2018 to deliver a keynote on Inspirational Applications of AI for Sri Lanka. He was recently recognized by Jeff Bezos, Founder/CEO of Amazon, for his memorable accomplishments while at Princeton University. Since then, Yasantha has 94 patents filed in the US, a great testament of the nations talent and potential. His work and research interests include developing Machine Learning/AI algorithms and Computer Vision systems for energy constrained embedded devices and innovative applications and AI algorithms for human presence, motion and gesture detection.

Sonu Nigam sings at Vogue Jewellers
Sonu Nigam, one of the most internationally acclaimed Bollywood singers visited Vogue flagship showroom in Colpetty to sing Vogue jingle Mangala mudu, mala, valalu in his own style.
It was indeed a Golden Evening amidst much glitterati exclusive for the media and social media personalities. Sonu Nigam moved around with the invitees, posed for formal and informal photographs with the invitees, making everyone feel totally overwhelmed.
This classic Vogue appears to be the oldest running jingle in Sri Lanka. Having first introduced during 1962, its inaugural year of operations, its highly memorable tune had remained unchanged throughout the three-stage remakes for broadcasting purposes.
We are delighted to host Sonu Nigam, an internationally renowned Bollywood singer at our showroom tonight. He is here to add a new lease of life to Sri Lankas record-breaking jingle, Mangala mudu, mala, valalu produced for Vogue. It was my father, the late Chairman, Sarath Hemachandra who initiated the making of this iconic jingle. Nearly sixty years later, we can proudly continue to use the same timeless lyrics as it has been crafted with much foresight - just like our exquisite jewellery of timeless value and the unparalleled service we offer, Vogue Jewellers Managing Director, Anura Hemachandra said.
It has been so tastefully scripted by Sri Lankas most sought after, legendary lyricist, the late Karunaratne Abeysekera, while its music direction has been by the late Maestro, T. F. Latiff. Veteran singer, Rupa Indumathi had sung its initial version, while in late 1980s, the Queen of Sinhala music, Kalasuri Latha Valpola has sung its second re-make, retaining the same tune. In early 2000s, Visaradha Neela Wickramasinghe voiced its latest version which is being aired over the Radio to-date. With the exception of the same jingle being sung by Kavindya Adhikari and Nademal Perera to a different tune for the purposes of reaching out to the young bridal market, this jingle has been running for nearly sixty years without changing its melody.
We pride ourselves on having pioneered many a ground breaking moves throughout out our glittering history of operations. Re-locating the flagship showroom in Colpetty, which was essentially a residential area in nineteen sixties; introducing several innovative concepts; redefining standards in the jewellery industry of Sri Lanka pioneering to appoint high ranking fashion icons and celebrities for promotional purposes and taking Vogue to the international arena are a few among many, Hemachandra added. - IT

St. Judes feast on October 27 and 28
The annual feast of the Indigolla National Shrine of Saint Jude Thaddeus will be held on a grand scale on October 27 and 28.
The shrine is well known among Catholics, Christians and even non-Christians for favours received through the intercession of Saint Jude who Catholics believe mediates to God on their behalf.
Devotees from near and far attend the healing service held at the shrine every Thursday and the crowds that attend this service bear testimony to the power of Saint Jude and the faith people place in him. This year, the hoisting of the flag was held on October 18 at 5.30 pm followed by Holy Mass at 6 pm. This was followed by preparatory novenas followed by Holy Mass from October 19 to 26 at 6.45 pm.
The Solemn Vespers Service will be held at 7 pm on October 27, presided over by Rt. Rev. Dr. Maxwell Silva, Auxiliary Bishop of Colombo, and the Eucharistic Procession will take place after the Vespers Service.

Ten ways to rejuvenate overworked skin
If your hands are suffering, try these tips to make them more comfortable.
1. avoid soap if you can
Avoid formulas with synthetic fragrances, preservatives, and sulfates, as these are all drying. Foaming and antibacterial types are also likely to strip your skin of its own natural fats and oils. Choose moisturizing cleansers instead, and be sure you rinse thoroughly.
2. moisturize, moisturize, moisturize
After each and every wash, moisturize your hands. Carry moisturizer with you. Try our Coconut Body Oil or our Radiant Skin Silkboth absorb easily and soothe the skin.
3. avoid hot-air dryers
There are becoming more and more popular because they save money and the environment, but they can easily dry-out your hands. Pat-dry with some toilet paper or simply shake dry, then put on your lotion!
4. wear gloves
You may already do this, but sometimes we forget. The best treatment is always prevention, so whether youre out on the job, gardening, or simply washing the dishes, gloves will help protect your hands from damage. Avoid vinyl ones, however, as they can make skin even more dry. Use cotton and leather.
5. exfoliate
We have learned to exfoliate our faces, but we often neglect our hands. Yet the skin on the handsespecially on the back of themis thin, fragile, and even more susceptible to damage than some areas of the face. If youre severely dry and calloused, try a pumice stone after bathing. You can also put about 1-2 tablespoons of sugar in your hands, add in some olive oil, and rub both the front and back of your hands to loosen up that dry, dull skin. Use 1-4 times a week, depending on your skins needs, and always apply a moisturizing lotion immediately afterwards.
6. wear gloves to bed
Damaged hands need serious moisturizing, so its time to deep-treat overnight. Apply a super thick moisturizer like our Coconut Honey Mask, some jojoba oil, or vitamin E, then go soak in the bath or the sauna, or better yet, put on some cotton gloves or wool socks and go to bed.
You can also try placing Ziploc bags around your hands with rubber bands around your wrists to lock in the moisture. Rinse off in the morning.
7. use a humidifier
Particularly in the winter and in dry climates, a humidifier can be a lifesaver when it comes to your skin. The most important place to have one is in your bedroom, so you can take advantage of it while you sleep.
8. invest in some pure aloe
This natural substance is a miracle worker when it comes to providing moisture.
9. bathe in oats
Cooked or raw oats are great for chapped hands. Add it to your bathwater, or mix it up with some warm olive or jojoba oil in a basin and soak your hands in it for 10-15 minutes.
10. pure coconut oil
This stuff is magic for skin because of its unique combination of fatty acids. Apply it directly onto skin and wear gloves for the best results.

Too many cooks spoil the broth
There are many men and every stone is not a gem. No two men can be the same. They differ in one aspect or the other. If both are talented, they may not be equally so.
When we take up a project we need a team of workers. To avoid confusion, we divide responsibilities. Otherwise there is bound to be confusion. There should be one hand at a job.
If the boat is rowed by more than one boatman, they should have a perfect and clear understanding. Otherwise each one will do so differently and cause a mishap.
In a kitchen if more than one cook prepares the same dish, there is the possibility of the dish being spoiled, if all are allowed to have their say.
Every ones work is no ones responsibility. Each person does the job the way he or she likes. The result is nothing but a big chaos.
In an ancient folktale the pigeons who were caught in a net tried to let each other carry the burden of the net. The net came down to earth because of this. They all needed to fly according to a certain rhythm for them to make their escape and free themselves from the net.
In a house with too many servants or masters, there will be no order. Similarly too many cooks in the kitchen will spoil a meal. Therefore know your task and work together. Then you will be able to produce good results.

Tourism industry ready for next leap - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed satisfaction in Sri Lanka being named as the Top Destination for 2019 by The Lonely Planet, yesterday.
The PM said this achievement should be turned into a starting point to reach a higher level of tourism and double the revenue that the country has accrued from tourism.
The Premier added that the governments policy of giving prominence to tourism since 2015 has led to make this achievement.
Making a special statement he said that existing shortcomings in the tourism sector should be looked into. We have to ensure that we plan for the future: that we cater for backpackers as well as high spending tourism.
The full text of the Prime Ministers statement: The Lonely Planet has named Sri Lanka as the Top Destination for 2019. I must first and foremost express our satisfaction and our delight in being so-named. This is a result of a policy we have followed from 2015, of giving prominence to tourism, of developing tourism - that today we have come into this category of being the top tourist destination.
We have to maintain this, we cannot be satisfied with one destination award; it is only a start. We have to look at the shortcomings in our tourist system (there are many), and we have to overcome them. We have to ensure that we plan for the future; that we cater for backpackers as well as high spending tourists.
What matters to us first and foremost is a high income from tourists, not merely the numbers. Today we are a destination for people from Japan, China, India, and into Europe. We have to increase the numbers coming into the country. We have to safeguard our historical monuments, we must safeguard our natural wildlife, and we have to add more attractions.
Tourism today concerns a large number of people, not merely large hoteliers but all those who have homestay accommodations, small shops, and small restaurants. We should widen and increase the numbers participating and benefitting in tourism.
At this moment I would like to thank all those who are responsible for us being named a top destination. The Minister, Minister John Amaratunge and his staff, the Tourist Development Authority, members of the Tourism Task Force, and Advisory the Committee, who gave us their valuable service; all the people who are connected to and involved in the hospitality and tourism industry; and finally, I must also thank the people of Sri Lanka, for the friendly demeanour they have shown to all tourists. Thats a part of our nature and part of our heritage.
Let us make this award, for us, a starting point to go to a higher level of tourism. We are restructuring ourselves to be an export economy, and in the export economy, the tourism has received a principle place since it can be one of the fastest foreign exchange earners. Let us make it the starting point to double the revenue that we have from tourism, the PM said.

Towards a new political culture
President Maithripala Sirisena is widely reported in the media as having stated that the UNP today was not what it was under its founder leader and first Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake. Not just the President, there would be many old timers who would hold the same view. Many had forgotten the pioneering role the Grand Old Party played in ushering Independence to the country. Even most party diehards would agree that the party had done little in drawing the attention of the present generation to this signal honour. Schoolchildren and others must be educated on this aspect.
Addressing a ceremony at the BMICH on Monday to commemorate four Senanayakes namely D.S., Dudley, R.G. and F.R. who played leading roles in securing Independence in 1948, President Sirisena went on to say that when he joined forces with the UNP in 2014 he was under the firm impression that the party was the same one founded by D.S. Senanayake, but he had learned differently. The late D.S. Senanayake was patriotic and adopted homegrown agricultural policies. This is why the UNP became a great party. The UNP was built upon the visions of these great men. I hope the UNP would find greatness and become the real party that was founded by these leaders, he said.
The Presidents observation about the current UNP could be equally applied to his own party, the SLFP. He perhaps will be the first to admit the SLFP today is not exactly the same party that was founded by the former Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who himself broke ranks with the UNP to form the new party. For all intents and purposes the Blues today have merged with the Greens, literally and metaphorically. It (the SLFP/UPFA) is part of the Government headed by the President, with the UNP as a leading partner.
In fact the SLFP, policy-wise, has come a long way since the Bandaranaike days starting from 1956. Upon assuming the Presidency in 1994, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga lost no time in completely changing the outlook of the party. The concept of privatization, until then a bad word in the SLFP lexicon, was embraced with gusto by CBK who embarked on a programme of deregulation in tune with global trends at the time.
As promised on her campaign trail CBK sought to give the open economy a human face whatever that may have meant, and made radical changes to the traditional SLFP way of doing things. Among her first tasks in Office was inviting back to the country the Anglo-Dutch Shell Company which was shown the door in the early sixties, and also the sale of loss making state ventures, a course that was unthinkable during the hay-day of the SLFP.
She famously claimed that she, who at one time was a good socialist, would now be a good capitalist, which prompted one of her firebrand MPs Dullas Alahapperuma to remark in Parliament that aanduwa vamata signal dala dakunata harawanawa (the Government is signalling to the Left and turning to the Right). Not only that, CBK also profusely apologized to the nation for the Sinhala Only policy that deprived the rural youth a knowledge of English which held the key to the outside world.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, too, for all his pretensions to being a true blue SLFPer, continued with the status quo and even ventured far afield against the entrenched policies of the party, such as when he attempted to fiddle with the EPF, a project that unfortunately culminated in the death of a youth.
Of course, what President Sirisena truly meant when he alluded to the departure of the UNP from the D.S. policies, no doubt, was the extent to which the party had drifted from the outlook of the early days. However, it must be borne in mind that political parties have to change their vision and mission in tune with the times. Politics is not a static phenomenon anywhere in the world. It is dynamic and vibrant, sometimes even controversial. Indeed, the Greens and Blues are not alone in this respect.
Both major political parties must however address the cancer of corruption. Former President J.R. Jayewardene publicly claimed that the reason he gave thumping salaries to his Ministers was to keep them away from corrupt acts. However, as it transpired, the higher salaries only made our politician greedier that led to them making money through crooked means.
Indeed, many wonder whether the political culture that is prevalent today has deviated widely from the policies and visions of the founding fathers of the various parties. It is through a thorough introspection and a change of this vicious culture where the worship of mammon takes precedence over service to the public that both the UNP and SLFP can do justice to their founder leaders.

Unity Government ensured nations well-being: Minister
The nation voted the Good Governance Government into power in hopes that it would establish a fair political system, Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
He said that the coalition of the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was a sign that unity could exist even amidst the political violence that prevailed in the country.
The UNP and SLFP did have disagreements, but they had still been able to work together to ensure the development of the country, as well as the well-being of its people, Minister Dissanayake said.
The minister said that when President Maithripala Sirisena and other SLFPers allied with the UNP, it was to stay true to the values of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party by ridding the country of the oppression that pervaded it during the previous regime.
I believe that the Good Governance Government will endure until 2020,  he said, adding that the Opposition only knew to conduct marches and protests, while spreading false rumours in order to deceive and distract the public.
The most recent rumour was that of the plans to form a caretaker government, which was ludicrous, the minister said. It was but a poor strategy to instigate the nation against the government, he added.

US donates Rs. 600 mn for mine clearance
A delegation from the US State Departments Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement visited Sri Lanka from October 8 to 12, to observe US-funded demining activities and meet with some of the beneficiaries of these projects.
The projects are part of the nearly Rs. 600 million ($3.5 million) in assistance that the US State Department has provided towards Sri Lankas demining efforts in 2018.
The group met with the Re-settlement Ministry, the National Mine Action Centre, and the Sri Lanka Armys Engineering Brigade and travelled to Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, and Mannar to review mine clearance operations.
During meetings with families who had returned to their homes on land recently released back to them, the delegation heard about the impact mine clearance has made on the daily lives of local residents. Thus far in 2018, US funding has cleared 1.86 million square metres and safely removed 9,344 landmines and unexploded ordnance and 8,637 items of small arms ammunition.
We are proud to support Sri Lankas national mine action strategy and the goal of making Sri Lanka mine-impact free by 2020, said Charg d'affaires Robert Hilton. Landmine removal directly supports peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka by allowing citizens to return safely to their homes, businesses, schools, and places of worship.
Since 2002, the United States has provided more than Rs. 9.5 billion ($56 million) to clear explosive hazards in Sri Lanka. Thanks to US funding and in cooperation with the Sri Lanka Army, the Batticaloa district was declared mine-impact free in 2017. US funding continues to assist in clearance efforts in the other eight districts affected by landmine contamination and currently supports 664 de-mining jobs across the Northern and Eastern Provinces. The US government has assisted in clearance operations through its local partner the Delvon Association for Social Harmony and through international partners such as HALO Trust and the Mines Advisory Group. US funding has supported training and provided equipment to the Sri Lanka Army, including specially trained dogs for mine detection. The United States has also funded mine-risk education through international partner Spirit of Soccer.

Sri Lanka bring about dramatic change to their game:
We believed in ourselves  Chandimal
Outplayed for virtually the entire ODI series which they had already lost with England gaining a 3-0 lead Sri Lanka bounced back in dramatic fashion to beat the no. 1 ranked side by a comprehensive margin of 219 runs under the D/L method to salvage some pride in the fifth and final match played at the R Premadasa Stadium on Tuesday.
No doubt it was a dead rubber but like in the last home series against South Africa, Sri Lanka produced their best form after they had lost the series.
This is all about hard work. Credit goes to all the players and the coach and the supporting staff. They have done a wonderful job on and off the field. Thats what changed in this game. You have to believe in yourself, said Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal after Sri Lanka had inflicted on England their heaviest ODI defeat by way of runs.
The other thing is that we were mainly concerned about our fielding. As I said you cant control your batting and bowling, but you can control your fielding. If you can control that then your batting and bowling falls into place. Thats what we did as a team.
This is a really happy moment, beating the no. 1 team in the world. Credit goes to all the players, firstly Dikka and Sadeera, who gave us a really good start. They are the ones who set the tone. After that Mendis batted really well. Also when it comes to bowling, Kasun and Dushmantha were brilliant. Overall this is a really good performance, and Im sure the boys will continue this going forward.
We all know we are a young team. We just want to keep improving with every game. Thats what we always discuss at our team meetings. The main thing is fielding. If you can keep that energy and good attitude when you are fielding, other things will fall into place. Thats what we did as a team.
We had lost the series when we got here, but we were intent on regaining form ahead of the T20I and Tests. Im glad three of our Test batsmen made runs today. Were hopeful we can take that confidence into the next two series.
The captain had a word of praise for the struggling Kusal Mendis who finally came good to score a splendid fifty off 33 balls that comprised six sixes.
We trusted him. We looked at his fielding, and that was the No. 1 reason we trusted him. His attitude on the field was great. We know that when you have a player like that, he can get into form very quickly. We know how good a batsman he is and we had a lot of trust in that. He took that responsibility on and played well for the team, said Chandimal.
Its not just Mendis, but a lot of players experience ups and downs. And thats not just in cricket, even in family life you have ups and downs. It can happen to anyone. Kusal is our future and everyone in the team trusts him. He has come back to form, and Im sure hell take that forward.
Chandimal appealed to the spectators and fans to have faith in the team because it is their support that encourages them.
When the ground is full of spectators and fans, we are really happy when we play, because we know they are with us. Today being a work day maybe not many people were able to come.
Whether we are winning or losing, its the fans who encourage us and spur us on. Right now we ask that the spectators and media to give us whatever support they can. If we get that support, we will be able to grow even more.
Chandimal said that they were still in the process of looking at a few players before the World Cup next year.
Today we gave a few new cricketers the chance to see where they are. Our big picture is the World Cup. Before we get there if we can give the youngsters in the team opportunities, thats what we are hoping to do.
MORGAN UNHAPPY WITH ENGLANDS PERFORMANCE
Englands one-day captain Eoin Morgan described Englands performance as extremely poor and hoped the experience could prove beneficial to them ahead of the World Cup.
"For 50 overs today we were under serious pressure and we didn't have a lot of answers. That gives us a good opportunity to go back and look at everything from preparation right down to the end result. That's always better when you've been put under a lot of pressure, said Morgan who rested himself from this match allowing Jos Buttler to take over the reins.
"We didn't take our game forward today. There were areas it went backwards. Our fielding was extremely poor, our attitude was very poor and that has to be addressed. We'll have to break down everything from yesterday's practice. Did we do too much the day before the game Did we overcook ourselves We might have been a little bit fatigued. I don't know. We will break it down and find an answer because otherwise we're just papering over the cracks which is not what we want to do," he said.

Wiggie to form party, contest PC poll
Former Northern Province Chief Minister (CM) C.V. Wigneswaran said he will contest at the upcoming Provincial Council election under his newly formed party Thamizh Makkal Kootani (TMK).
Speaking of his future political aspirations in Jaffna yesterday, Wigneswaran thanked all who supported his political journey in the past five years and said the party was formed to ensure the protection of rights and lives of Tamil people.
He said that he has four options with the end of his term as the chief minister: first is to go home silently, second is to join a political party and contest for the elections, third is to form a political party on his own and fourth option is to lead the people.
If I choose the first option, my family would be happy and even I can enjoy my retirement. If I am to take such a decision, I should never have stepped into politics and it will discourage many people and the promises that I have made to them which is against my conscience. So I will not take that decision, he said.
He said that he does not represent any party and added that after he won the elections, TNA tried to use him as a puppet to which he never agreed.
There is four years gap between me and TNA now. The gap increased as there were no solutions to issues faced by the Tamil people. Therefore, I cannot even think of contesting with the TNA. As long as I do not act as a puppet even they would not agree to give a chance, he said.
Wigeneswaran said the TNA has forgotten its vision and is now working according to the whims and fancies of the government.
The TNA has accepted the unitary system of government and that it is a Buddhist country.They should explain their state on this matter,he said.
Tamils fought equally with the Sinhalese for the independence of the country. But it was very unfortunate when the Sinhalese took all initiatives to keep all administration under their purview after 1920, he said. He said that Tamils have been fighting for their rights since then and added that they gained political rightsto an extent after 2009.
Tamils should continue to fight for their rights and it is a struggle for self defence.Tamils would have disappeared if we had not fought for our identity, he said.
He said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa after the end of war and the present government with the national government got ample opportunities to strengthen reconciliation, yet no effective measures were taken.
Another party wont solve issues - TNA
Former TNA Northern Provincial Councillor M. K. Sivajilingam yesterday said that the Tamil people do not want to have another party or new Chief Minister but they want to have a permanent solution to the ethnic issue.
There is no point of forming political parties.All parties should get together to achieve a permanent solution to the Tamils issue, he said.
Sivajilingam said former Chief Minister C.V.Vigneswaran invited him to join his new political party but he politely declined his invitation.
Wigneswaran should join hands with Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, if he wants to achieve a sustainable solution to the Tamils issues. Our objectives will never realise, if we are divided in terms of political parties, he said.

Disney has unveiled the first teaser trailer for Guy Ritchies live-action adaptation of the beloved 1992 animated film, which stars Mena Massoud as Aladdin, Naomi Scott as Princess Jasmine, Marwan Kenzari as Jafar, and Will Smith as the Genie.
Earlier this year at CinemaCon, Disney executive Cathleen Taff teased Smiths take on the character that Robin Williams had memorably portrayed.
No one can replicate the iconic performance by Robin Williams, and we wouldnt want them to, she said.
Lets just say, hes a little Fresh Prince, a little Hitch, and a whole lot of attitude. Aladdin flies into theaters on May 24. EW

Zeroing  in on the  flab
There is no permanent fix for cellulite. Though almost everyone experiences cellulite at some point, misinformation about it is just as common as the dimpled nuisance that plagues our thighs, butts and bellies. However there are plenty of things you can do to minimize cellulite with or without the help of expensive medical treatments.
Food and cellulite
Eating a lot of refined and processed foods encourages cellulite to form. The skin is the largest organ of detoxification in the body, and a chemical and impurity-laden diet will attempt partial excretion through the skin, where toxicities and metabolites can bundle together in tissues. Make sure you eat a diet of nutrient-dense, natural foods.
Too much salt causes swelling, which affects the appearance of cellulite. When combined with poor quality skin, the swelling can happen between the skin areas like a honeycomb showing signs of cellulite
The impact of exercise on cellulite
A regular exercise practice cannot cure cellulite but in many cases it can help prevent or reduce its appearance. Cellulite occurs when connective fibers underneath the skin become weak or lose their elasticity, but stretching and strengthening those areas (in addition to burning away excess fat overall) can help.
Firming and toning those muscles will in turn tighten the skin, giving the illusion that cellulite is less noticeable. Yoga routines that target the butt and thighs can help, as well as strength-training moves that build muscle and boost circulation.
Running or other forms of cardio can help keep weight off, which may reduce the appearance of dimples and dents.
Weight loss and cellulite
Weight loss is not a guaranteed cellulite removal strategy, but maintaining a healthy weight through diet and regular exercise can certainly help. There will be less fat beneath the uneven connective tissue to create the dimpled appearance as you lose weight.
Within about two months of beginning a weight-loss program, you might begin to see a slight reduction in cellulite. Maintaining your lowered weight is a must, though, as yo-yo dieting and weight fluctuations can sabotage your battle against cellulite.
Homeremedies forcellulite reduction
Massage
One promising remedy is massage. This can be done at home or with the help of a professional massage therapist. Massages have a multitude of mind-body benefits, but you may also enjoy reduced thigh cellulite in the process.
Massage may reduce cellulite by improving lymphatic drainage. It can also help stretch your skin tissue - this can help stretch out cellulite dimples, too.
Drink more water
Drinking water is another low-cost option that may help with cellulite. Not only does it keep you hydrated, but water also helps remove the toxins that can lead to fat accumulation. Water can also help encourage circulation and lymphatic flow.
Green tea
Green tea can speed your metabolism and help you burn fat by stopping the production of fat-absorbing enzymes. But, catechins found in green and white teas can also reduce insulin resistance.
Omega-3s
Another theory is that consumption of the wrong kinds of fats leads to an imbalance of the fatty acids that the body needs for smooth skin and tissue. There is some evidence that consuming enough Omega-3 fatty acids and fat soluble vitamins will help reduce cellulite over time. Either way, Omega-3s and fat soluble vitamins are important for many other functions in the body, so it wont hurt to try it!
Lifestyle changes are your best bet
Unfortunately, theres no way to prevent cellulite, according to the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery. Its a common condition, and the risk increases with age and certain lifestyle choices.
Although you cant control your age, you can make some changes to your lifestyle that can help reduce the amount of cellulite on your thighs.
Talk to your dermatologist if youre interested in professional procedures to reduce the appearance of cellulite. Some treatments, such as laser therapy, may help but wont fully erase cellulite on your thighs.

Also important - know that results from any remedy or procedure arent permanent - youll likely have to repeat the process to continually reduce the appearance of thigh cellulite.

Flash film  far from fast
The Flash may be the fastest man alive in the pages of DC Comics but the superheros film franchise is taking a slower route to the silver screen. The Warner Bros. plan to give the Justice League character a spin-off screen adventure of his own is still in the running but now its looking more like a marathon than a wind sprint.
The Flash is now expected to get filming underway late next year, which puts the superhero movie on pace for a release date sometime in 2021.
The Flash solo film has never secured an official green-light status and studio sources point out that no official release date has ever been announced. But those same studio sources confirmed Monday that a finish line in 2021 was not the target they had hoped for - in relatively recent discussions their best-case scenario had been a March 2019 start-date for filming. Now they say that is simply too impractical due to scheduling conflicts. The primary issue they cited is the schedule of the movies lead actor. Ezra Miller, who portrayed the Flash in Justice League (2017), and is tabbed to reprise the role, is already locked-in for duty in another high-profile Warner Bros. project: Fantastic Beasts.
Miller plays Credence Barebone in that spin-off of Harry Potter and its magical mythology. Miller is needed on-set in July to start work on a third Fantastic Beasts installment. Deadline

US potential retraction from African Growth And Opportunity Act
Lankan apparels from Ethiopia, Kenya could lose duty free access
The unprecedented shift in US foreign policy following the election of Donald Trump as the President has contributed to further volatility on the political economy with particular implications for Sri Lanka Vis-a-Vis the US potential retraction from the African Growth And Opportunity Act (AGOA).
In a context where GSP plus is compromised, the potential loss of rival economic benefits such as provisions of AGOA would create considerable dent in Sri Lankan export market, Eran Wickramaratne, State Minister for Finance and Mass Media told at the third edition of Islamic Finance Forum of South Asia, held in Colombo on Tuesday.
Sri Lankan apparel companies have begun operating in Ethiopia and Kenya to gain the duty free access to the US market under the provisions of (AGOA). However, scholars and politicians have repeatedly noted that they may retract from the agreement, he said.
The Minister said further that in 2015, Iran agreed a long-term deal on its nuclear programme with the group of world powers. Under the accord, Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of economic sanctions.
However, President Trumps administration announced that US will leave the deal indicating that Washington will begin to reinstate sanctions.
In addition to sanctions imposed by US on Iran in August, 2018, Minister said the remaining sanctions will be imposed in November this year. Accordingly, port operators, ship builders, petroleum related transactions and transactions of foreign financial institutions with central bank of Iran will be mainly affected.
As a result of this, Sri Lankas tea exports and the import of crude oil are both affected in recent months. Most likely, Sri Lanka will have to purchase refined oil products rather than crude oil as we go forward. This could mean a considerably higher cost for the country, Wickramaratne said.
Currently, Iran is the third largest crude oil producer within the OPEC, with a production of four million barrels per day.
Brexit is particularly significant for Sri Lanka Vis-a- Vis the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). We are speculating that overall exports to the EU may increase by nearly US $ 500 million as a result of getting GSP Plus. However, Brexit would remove access to the British market under various provisions, causing a significant market loss as UK is the second highest export destination to Sri Lanka, he said.
Furthermore, Sri Lanka intends to be globally integrated and build regional connections, the Minister said adding that Sri Lanka has dialogue partner status in ASEAN, as a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum and the country will be using its trade agreements with Singapore and potential trade agreement with Thailand to bring it closer to obtaining observer status in ASEAN by 2025, with the goal of an FTA, as well as linking to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement (RCEP).

SL, India have long-standing friendship
Sri Lanka and India have enjoyed a long-standing friendship and it goes back to the era of ancient Sinhala kings. Now certain persons and groups are trying to create an anti-India campaign in Sri Lanka, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Sri Lanka received Buddhism, the science of ayurveda, music, artistic traditions and more from India. A country with a developing economy cannot become a developed country on its own. Therefore, Sri Lanka should obtain the support of India, Minister Senaratne said.
He was speaking at a ceremony to lay the foundation stone for a new water supply scheme in Kalutara. Minister Senaratne said Rs. 32,278 million is to be spent on the proposed water supply scheme which will provide salt-free drinking water for 573,000 people living in 269 grama niladhari divisions.
A total of 32,000 new water connections will be provided under the project. The project will be completed by July 2019.
By 2020, a total of Rs. 15,200 million should be paid. Similar amounts are to be paid for the loans obtained to construct Mattala airport. The present government has built a friendly relationship with India and neighboring countries, he said.

BOI attracts Rs 22.15 bn FDI for Trincomalee in 2017
The BOI has played a major role in strengthening the economy of the Trincomalee District with a view of implementing the Governments policy to develop regional industrialization. With its large natural harbour, Trincomalee offers considerable opportunities to attract FDI. In 2017 the cumulative value of investment was Rs 22,150 million.
There are currently five projects in the Trincomalee District which are awaiting implementation, with an estimated value of Rs. 13,804 million. These projects will generate an additional 634 new employment opportunities.
In the past, the Trincomalee had suffered as a result of the internal conflict faced by the country. Economic development generated by investment has fostered and brought about transformations which have positively affected the lives of those living there.
The main advantages that Trincomalee can offer investments are diversity, which means that a variety of economic activities can be developed.
Currently there are six projects involved in manufacturing areas such as grains and flour, cement and salt production and garments. Other sectors with potential for generating export revenue include IT and fish and aquaculture.
In addition there are currently 17 BOI projects in Trincomalee of which seven are tourism related. The project include Anilana Hotels and Properties Ltd., Jungle Beach Resort (Pvt) Ltd, Lotus Park Hotel (Pvt) Ltd., River View Palm Hotel (Pvt) Ltd., Sea Lotus Park Hotel (Pvt) Ltd., Trinco Holiday Resorts (Pvt) Ltd and Trinco Beach Hotel (Pvt) Ltd.
It is therefore the strategic objective of the Government of Sri Lanka to reposition Trincomalee as the tourism hub of the Eastern Province. BOI has played an important part in developing this sector, an official from BOI said.
Examples of these include Cinec Skills (Pvt) Ltd (IT), Aqua N Green Ltd (Aquaulture) and Oceanpick (Pvt) Ltd (Aquaculture).
BOI enterprises are also very significant employers in Trincomalee, generating 2,606 employment opportunities for local residents. Among these are 1,280 female employees working with BOI enterprises in the Trincomalee district. This reflects a healthy gender balance among BOI enterprises in the district.
Trincomalee is in fact rich with skilled and unskilled workers and there are many opportunities to set up enterprises in the district utilizing these human resources. The development in Trincomalee reflects the current commitment on the part of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade to promote development through investment, notably FDI in outlying areas, particularly those which have undergone difficulties due to the countrys internal conflict and natural disasters such as the past tsunami.

Elephants of the perahera
Caught between culture and controversy
On a hill beside the Temple of the Tooth, beyond the dizzying crowds vying for perahera seats and high above the hoards of tourists shuffling through the Temple, there is a massive pool of water. Humps of gray peak out from the glistening, still surface, creating an idyllic image far from the flashing lights and beating drums of the festival. Here, the elephants of the perahera are in rare form  relieved, relaxed, some dozed off in a heavy afternoon slumber, fully succumbing to the weight of exhaustion.
Sunil Rambukpotha, secretary to the lay custodian at the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, explained that while at the perahera, many of the elephants stop trying to sleep. They are used to sleeping in water, but during the festival, spend their days and nights chained up in the heat. The hectic crowds, a new environment, and all of the other elephants around make a recipe for restlessness.
This elephant bath is the latest addition to the Esala Perahera to improve conditions for elephants  which have come under scrutiny in recent years. Some activists have gone as far as to call the festival a form of socially accepted animal abuse.
But here, on the Saturday afternoon before the grand finale of the festival, the elephants get a brief but sweet taste of their natural habitat  a glimmer of familiarity and calm amidst 10 frenzying days of festivities.
The mahouts
While in the pool, the elephants are apathetic to the mahouts, who move around them, scrubbing tirelessly at their fleshy bodies.
The water of the pool soaked through Nihals sarong as he carefully plucked at the tail of his elephant in pensive concentration. He had the elephants tail in his right hand and a piece of sharpened coconut husk wedged between his left arm and side. Between questions, he would jump back into scrubbing the elephant, every so often re-sharpening the coconut husk with a knife.
Nihal spoke in short but polite sentences. He said the whole process  scrubbing the 5,000 plus kilo beast from head to toe  takes him about three hours. The hardest part is the head, he explained, because it has many bends and shapes, and touching the head can change the mood of the elephant.
A working mahout for 38 years, Nihal says he chose the job because it commands a lot of respect. But any respect that the centuries-old job has is hard-earned. The daily groundwork of a mahout is a far cry from the glamour of the pageant.
Late Friday afternoon, throughout the streets of Kandy, mahouts hang out in makeshift campsites near their elephants. One group was staying in a metal encasement. Cloth stretched across wooden planks formed a surrogate bed and clothing dangled from the metal scaffolding.
The mahouts feet rested on the wooden planks, arms folded over their knees, eyes heavy as they looked out onto the elephants in front of them, squinting into the afternoon sun. For mahouts and elephants alike, these are long, sleepless nights.
One particularly outgoing mahout wandered out of the campsite to show off his elephant. As he lifted his arm to point, he revealed a tattoo of an elephant on his inner forearm. His entire face rose into a smile when he introduced his elephant, Mali.
Nihal was quieter about his work, but no less devoted. Hes a very gentle mahout, he knows what hes doing Sunil whispered, as Nihal moved around the elephant with familiar ease. He doesnt yell or act aggressively at the elephant, like other mahouts.
The controversy
The devotion to these beasts evinced by Nihal and the other mahouts is in stark contrast to the stories of mahouts that have surfaced online in recent years.
Videos of mahouts hitting elephants, footage of elephants storming the streets, images of elephants with wounds from being poked with the ankus, and stories of elephants sent to the festival despite experiencing musth (a period of hormonal surge that makes male elephants particularly aggressive), all give mahouts a reputation of being irresponsible and uneducated.
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) reports that elephants live in constant fear of mahouts, who scare them into obedience. And the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka (WNPS) issued a statement condemning the mahouts treatment of elephants. Keeping elephants has moved away from traditional practices. As a result, the centuries-old knowledge of caring for elephants among elephant keepers, or mahouts, has been largely lost. They base their methods of control on fear and cruelty towards their wards, they said.
Beyond the mahouts, the conditions of the elephants  tied up for 10 days with limited exercise and ridden by humans in a way that can cause irreparable damage to the spine  has also earned the perahera a reputation of being a nightmare for elephants.
Such reports have led NGOs and animal rights groups to call for the removal of elephants from festivals. The caustic WNPS statement demands that keeping elephants captive, become a thing of the past, and adds that, none of the cruelty, captivity, deprivation, restraint and regimentation suffered by these young animals can be justified in a Buddhist context.
The history
But other scholars and activists hesitate to uproot such a deeply entrenched culture. For some people, making captive elephants a thing of the past would mean relegating a culture they feel in the present to the past too.
It takes only a stroll down the streets of Kandy during the perahera to see such fidelity to tradition. Thousands and thousands of Sri Lankans lie all day in the sun, on blankets spread on the hot, tar pavement, waiting for the festival. Ninety percent of those who visit the pageants and specifically the perahera are from the village areas, travelling long distances to be there, Dr. Wijemohan, who has studied the physical conditions of captive elephants, explained. If those people say elephants should not be in pageant, I will accept it, but not from the people who are in the cities  they dont have that kind of faith in the pageant.
If the people believe celebrating the perahera can offer a once-in-a-lifetime blessing, Dr. Wijemohan doesnt feel it is right to interfere. For the village people its a real belief, so I would not destroy that, and I have no right to destroy that.
Dr. Wijemohan said having elephants in the perahera is a cultural fact, enshrined in many years of ritual and tradition, so the question is not whether or not the elephants participate but how to keep the elephants who do, healthy.
As the sun set on the penultimate day of the perahera, Sachinie Lawanthika, a volunteer in the media department at the Temple of the Tooth and a self-identified elephant enthusiast, explained the long history of the elephants in the festival.
Elephants have been used in captivity for thousands of years for tasks from transportation and labour to sacred tasks in temples and religious festivals. They have been used in Kandys Esala perahera since its beginning as far back as 1754 and perhaps earlier.
Sri Dalida Maligawa tuskers have the responsibility of carrying the casket of the Sacred Tooth Relic. In the procession, which is a rain dance, the elephants represent the storm clouds. (The drums symbolise thunder and fire stands for lightning.)
As Sachinie recounted the history of the perahera elephants, her voice was occasionally drowned out by the loud, rhythmic sound of chains clashing together. Each time, the sound was accompanied by an elephant descending the driveway beside the World Buddhism Museum, on its way to line up for the parade.
From memory, she told us the name of the elephant, its hometown, and the history of the owner. I can identify each of them by their tusks, she said proudly.
When I asked her if the tuskers of the perahera were more important than the ordinary elephants, she joked, Well, all of them are important to me.
When the elephant passed and the sound faded into the distance, Sachinie continued explaining the symbolism of elephants, which, in a wider Buddhist context, represent youth.
And that youthful, playful side of the elephants was also on display at this years festival. On the final night of the perahera, just before the elephants were to be dressed for the evening festivities, two young elephants began to play.
Twisting and untwisting their trunks, they reached out to each other. At one point, the larger elephant fell down and the smaller started to climb on top of him, jumping around like an energetic toddler. As they played, their trunks swinging all around, an audience grew around them.
But what at first seemed like a fun elephant playdate, soon became a more gruesome scene. One elephant railed against his chains with such fervour, he fell over  chains pulled taut, head bobbing, legs splayed.
The flash of smartphone cameras illuminated the darkness and laughter echoed through the hills. Suddenly, what seemed like a fascinated, respectful group became a taunting crowd. The elephant rolled in the dirt, struggled to stand up. The crowd howled.
The companion
When asked why the elephants were behaving like this, a mahout explained that these two elephants were old pals and came from the same village.
Elephants form long-lasting relationships and have memories spanning decades. Some scientists attribute this to the elephants large hippocampus, a part of the brain that is connected to emotion through memory. In elephants, the hippocampus makes up a higher percentage (0.7 percent) of brain mass than it does in humans (0.5 percent).
The elephant cortex also has similarities to that of the human, leading some scientists to believe there may be convergent evolution.
Such beliefs might explain why elephants and humans can form such an intense connection. Its like having a friend, Sunil said, describing Kandula, one of the perahera elephants he knew as a child in Badulla.
Kandula has been with me since I was a schoolboy, our association is over 50 years. We grew up together, he remembered. When I used to go away to college, three months later, I would come back and Kandula would recognise me and be very happy.
And this sort of memory is not uncommon. Sunil told another story about an elephant expert who had formed a close bond with a young elephant named Indi Raja. Fourteen years later, the expert visited the elephant at his new home in Sri Lanka. He spoke to Indi Raja softly, in the same language he had when the elephant was small, trying to get him to sit down. The elephant stopped eating, and listened closely. After a moment, he made a sound of recognition, followed the order, and lowered his body.
Sunil remembered the expert turning around from the elephant and saying, That is an elephants memory. Never play the fools game with this beast.
At the final night of the perahera, a crowd of people stood beside the Temple of the Tooth, close to the parade. As the procession moved forward, dancers jumping, plates twirling at the tops of rods, and torches lighting the walkway, one elephant stepped out of line, much to his mahouts disdain. But his misstep was met with glee  his owner standing by the side of the temple, reached out from the shaded corner and touched his trunk in a fond greeting.
The wild animal
According to one UN report, these warm and affectionate relationships can mislead people into thinking that elephants should be domesticated.
And while it might seem paradoxical, an animal with empathy and intelligence can still be wild. Because elephants have never been selectively bred, domesticated elephants are behaviorally and genetically identical to their wild counterparts.
Ironically, it is the same wit and amicable nature that has led humans to form bonds with elephants, which may make personifying them a bit too easy. Rumours circulate that elephants cry, that elephants think humans are cute, and that they dance to music. In reality, no evidence has shown that elephants cry and we can hardly ask an elephant what it thinks is cute.
As for dancing, elephants shaking their heads side to side or shifting weight with their feet has become an iconic image of elephants in carnivals and festivals, but this behaviour is stereotypical  it is out of the range of their normal behaviours in the wild.
Elephant advocates, enthusiasts, and researchers all have different explanations. One indigenous elephant doctor said it can be either a sign of happiness or a sign of anxiety  and that the right doctors could tell the difference. Sunil claimed it was the elephant trying to keep himself awake. Lay people say it is the elephant dancing. One of the top elephant researchers in Sri Lanka said it is a tell-tale sign of distress.
It is human nature to believe what we want to believe.
Many elephant experts agree that for cultural reasons, it would be impossible to remove the elephants from festivals. Instead, they argue, we should focus on improving conditions of elephants which participate in pageants.
Dr. Wijemohan says daily health monitoring is a must. Sumith Pilapitiya, a conservation researcher, recommends costume adjustments that will keep the elephants ears free and thereby enable the elephants to better regulate their temperature.
Train the mahouts so that they are kinder to the elephants  you dont have to frighten the animal to make it listen to you. If you are kind, it will respond to you kindly, says Jayantha Jayawardena, an Asian elephant expert, who has written about tame elephants in Sri Lanka.
The sight
Over the course of the perahera, elephants are scattered around Kandy. Some are tied to walls within the compound, others relegated to grassy hills beside the Temple, and an unlucky handful spend the duration of the festival in crowded streets just outside the Temple.
During the sweltering daylight hours, tourists and locals crowd around the elephants, phones and cameras at the ready for a coveted selfie. Some mahouts even try to make money by taking photographs. But between the clicking sound of an iPhone photo and the smiling faces, there are reminders of how unnatural it is to be so close to an elephant.
Sometimes that reminder is loud and dangerous  like when two elephants got loose and trampled a police car in the middle of the night, this year. Other reminders are subtler.
Theres grunt of an elephant, awoken from his slumber and forced out of the artificial, cement bathtub.
Theres the sound of the chains, clattering beneath the elephants neck and holding his feet together, rendering his stride more of a hobble. 
And then theres the elephants that have been brought all the way to Kandy, but dont get to be in the parade, because theyve misbehaved  perhaps theyve gone into musth or displayed the wrong attitude. In the dark of the night, they stand chained up, alone, like exiles, as the festival music beats on in the distance.

China, Sri Lanka trade ties have flourished since 1952 - Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said Sri Lanka was the first country in South Asia to begin economic relationships with China, with the signing of the historic China, Sri Lanka Rubber-Rice Pact in 1952.
Speaker Jayasuriya participating at the fifth anniversary of unveiling the Belt and Road Initiative, said China is the second largest economy in the world - second in terms of nominal GDP and this has obviously added much vigour to the dynamics of the fast unfolding economic development narrative of the 21st century Asia.
The event was held in collaboration with the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka and the Organisation for South Asian Friendship and Cooperation with China (OSARFCC) at the Galadari Hotel yesterday.
The Speaker said there is a very important fact that clearly stands out when it comes to Sri Lankas relations with China. It is the fact that China has always been direct, open, and consistent in its approach and the contributions from China have always been productive with tangible and visible results.
Megalopolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said the intensity of those religious and cultural relationships, which have been highlighted in the historical chronicles of both countries, go onto signify the strong trade and economic ties that the two countries had been enjoying at the time, mainly through the maritime silk route.
Sri Lanka had indeed been a maritime trading hub throughout history and the Chinese merchant ships had been frequenting ancient Sri Lankan ports at Galle, Trincomalee, Mannar and Beruwala, Minister Ranawaka added.
Minister Patali Champika further said that tradition of country-to-country and people-to-people relationship that has been in existence between the two countries for most part of the past two millennia.
Trade and maritime relationships with China had been at an intense level during the four and half centuries beginning from the late tenth century, the period during which China was indisputably the greatest maritime nation in the world, Minister Ranawaka said.
Ranawaka said that, last year a grand wedding ceremony for the marriage of 50 Chinese couples was held here symbolizing their historic lineage to Sri Lanka and, in the meantime, making it an opportunity to promote cross border cross cultural ties between the peoples of China and Sri Lanka.
Chinas Ambassador Cheng Xueyuan said there are endless stories and wonderful prospects for the friendship and cooperation between China and Sri Lanka.
We believe that China - Sri Lanka relations will usher in a more beautiful and bright future.
As a Chinese saying goes, the relationship between two countries is based on the affection between two countries civilians,the Ambassador said.

Immediate attention required:Unauthorised constructions along reservations on either side of canals
Soon after the flash floods that hit Colombo in the early 1990s the CMC, RDA and the Land Reclamation Department initiated a scheme under the direction of the then President late R. Premadasa whereby those living in unauthorized constructions within 10 feet from the bund of the canal were provided with land in Attidiya and moved out with transport and other facilities being provided to the families free of charge.
Thereafter all the unauthorized constructions were demolished and a 10 foot roadway was constructed alongside the canal so that trucks etc., could come regularly to collect the garbage retrieved from the canal.
As time passed on some people began constructing houses once again on the road reservation.
This could be clearly observed at some points on the Dehiwala side of Sri Subuthi Mawatha in Wellawatte. There is also another point on Veluwanarama Road close to the Pamankada Bridge where about six houses were demolished on a court order. This was okay for a few months, but since of late constructions have begun and nearly 10 houses have been built on the road reservation between Veluwanarama Road and the Canal. It is the duty of the Grama Niladaris of the area, Land Reclamation Board Officers and also the Environment Police to nab them at the construction stage. Even now they could be evicted since there is a previous court order.
The Police should also ensure that the residents of the area mentioned do not store building materials on the road and also mix cement etc., on the road causing inconvenience to the motorists as it blocks the road.

The effect of  crime stories
Detective stories tend to glorify crimes. Murderers, gangsters and crooks are always shown as tough, cunning and courageous people who get on with their job for a considerable time.
Movies are greatly responsible for making many people take the path of crime by making crimes look attractive. Police are shown as stupid and slow and civil characters shine by contrast. Many bank robberies and museum thefts were being planned and executed after the fashion of movies and crime thrillers came into existence.
Newspapers give glorious details of a murder or suicide with the details of drugs and methods used by the killers or the victims. The media has a moral duty towards its public. Giving attractive headlines, or publishing false information, to create alarm among its readers, are to be curbed. Yellow journalism will never appeal to the baser instincts of people. Text books are there to nurture value among the young minds. It is surprising after spending a lot of money, human energy and intelligence, the choice of lessons is so poor.
For example the villain is presented as an attractive character casual, brave, smart and successful with women. It is true that he finally gets caught. The whole lesson will deal glorifying the quick success of an immoral character. The events and situation will impress the reader and he might conclude that the life of crime is worth risking. Terrorists grow in our thoughts with a Halo of glory, as we are unable to stop their mindless killings. Is glorifying crimes not a crime

Electric fencing offers solution to human-elephant conflict
Months ago, President Maithripala Sirisena was riveted by yet another story of humanelephant conflict (HEC), when a child was killed by a wild elephant on her way to school, and he asked for a solution to mitigate the problem.
In Sri Lanka, HEC is more intense than anywhere else in the world. After decades of trying the same approach, a new proposal, which will be delivered to the President next week, outlines how strategically placed electric fences will help humans and elephants coexist.
Humans and elephants share about 44 percent of the land in Sri Lanka, and elephants have dwindled to a population of 4,000, one-fourth of what it was 100 years ago.
Because of the humanelephant conflict, each year, 70 people and roughly 250 elephants die. The Daily News reported that 2016 was the worst recorded year of the conflict, where 279 elephants and 88 people died.
Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando, a leading HEC researcher and a consultant on the proposal, explains where change is needed.
The conflict is because we have been continuously opening up areas where there have been elephants and cultivating land, he said. Elephants raid crops, peoples livelihoods, and humans try to defend them. The males and females have very different social organisations, said Dr. Fernando, explaining that along gender and age, male elephants are more or less likely to pursue crops and risk conflict. The females with young ones dont want to take the risk, he said, but males cannot be driven, they become more aggressive, so most HEC involves single male elephants.
Dr. Fernando says that for 70 years, the governments Wildlife and Forest Ministries have only been increasing the problem. They try to force elephants into protected areas, but end up separating them. As a result, typically, females and young ones are driven into protected areas that have already reached capacity and where resources are scarce. The females and babies die of starvation, and the single males are pushed into areas where agriculturalists live.
If we continue to separate elephants by chasing them, the conflict will only increase, said Fernando.
The new proposal describes strategically placed electric fencing, what Fernando calls, the only thing that is effective. The electric fencing that the ministries currently maintain is in the wrong place, said Fernando, which only separates elephant communities unnecessarily. We should be fencing, but we should use fencing in a logical manner to protect crops and settlements. That effectively mitigates the conflict, he said.
Fernandos approach has already proven successful in Sri Lankas North and West, where the highest levels of HEC occur. If it is effective where there is the highest HEC in Sri Lanka, then obviously its going to be effective, he said.

Guaranteeing ease of access to customers, this policy is available for purchase via the Fairfirst corporate website  www.fairfirst.lk. Additionally in the event of hospitalization all claims are settled directly to the hospital through the cashless facility.
The signing of the MoU took place together with the Managing Director and CEO of Fairfirst Insurance, Dr. Sanjeev Jha, Deputy CEO of DFCC Bank, Thimal Perera, Chairman of Reliance Insurance Brokers, Athula Sahabandu and other senior management personnel of the three parties.
Commenting on the partnership, the Deputy CEO of DFCC Bank, Thimal Perera said, We are pleased to partner with Fairfirst Insurance to offer our credit card holders this unique opportunity. Health is wealth  and this customized health policy offers coverage against both dengue and influenza hospitalization costs. Considering the high incidence of dengue and influenza in Sri Lanka which can entail hospitalization and heavy expenses, we felt this is a timely offer for our valued credit card customers to offer them the best protection. DFCC Bank constantly seeks to forge such partnerships to bring unique value additions to our credit card customers.
DFCC Bank is a fully-fledged commercial bank providing comprehensive commercial and development banking solutions. The Bank is also at the forefront of pioneering digitally enabled financial products and services that offer customers unmatched value and convenient benefits.
Athula Sahabandu, Chairman of Reliance Brokers said, This is a worthy proposition that augments what health insurance can offer to people. DFCC credit card holders and their immediate family members will be benefited by this coverage that comes at an affordable premium.

Fuel for  school day
Eating a good quality breakfast can increase feelings of alertness and motivation to learn. Childrens high metabolic turnover and rapid growth rates mean they need optimal nutrition. They have higher demands on their energy stores overnight as they sleep, and as they generally sleep longer than adults, children have a longer fasting time. Therefore, eating a nutritious breakfast is especially important to provide fuel for the oxidation of glucose.
When blood glucose levels are low, hormones such as adrenalin and cortisol are released which can cause feelings of agitation and irritability. This can then affect a childs concentration and may even cause destructive outbursts. Children who dont eat breakfast struggle to summon enough energy in the morning to cope with the demands of school.
Long-term effects
Eating a good breakfast can lead to better academic performance and a higher enjoyment of school. Also, children who regularly skip breakfast are more likely to be disruptive in class or to be absent from school. Repeatedly eating breakfast can lead to children learning to associate feelings of well-being with feeling less hungry.
In the long-term, eating breakfast affects a childs health, which in turn will have a positive effect on brain performance. Research has found that a good nutritional profile can lead to sustained improved performance. This would be much harder to achieve if kids skip breakfast.
There is also an association with mental health and a good quality breakfast. Common breakfast foods such as milk, fortified breakfast cereals and bread are good sources of nutrients that affect brain function. Research has found that eating a breakfast with a variety of food groups that increase the intake of vitamins and minerals at the start of the day can lead to better mental health in adolescents.
Children who skip breakfast are also more likely to snack. Snacks eaten between meals can provide up to one-quarter of the daily energy intake in some adolescent populations. Since snacking is often associated with energy dense food linked to the development of childhood overweight and obesity, educating children into a good breakfast routine at the start of the day is essential.

The ceremony was the finale of a series of anniversary ceremonies that got underway last week. The days chief guest, Major General Shavendra Silva, the Colonel of the Gajaba Regiment and the Adjutant General of the Army Headquarters was warmly welcomed by the Centre Commandant, Colonel Harendra Peiris.
A guard turnout in accordance with military formalities greeted the chief guest at the entrance to the Gajaba Regimental Centre. The Colonel of the Regiment also paid tribute to the Founding Father of the Gajaba Regiment, late Major General Wimalaratne by placing a floral wreath at his statute. He was then invited to accept the salute by the Parade Commander Lieutenant Colonel Sandun Dias in conformity with military traditions presented in his honour. Major General Silva paid his gratitude, during his brief address, to those who had served bravely, including the former Colonels of the Regiment, all officers and men, in order to maintain the regiments pride.
Then the Colonel of the Regiment placed a floral wreath at the Gajaba Monument in memory of all the officers and other ranks who paid the supreme sacrifice during the line of duty.
Regimental council members, the Centre Commandant, Deputy Centre Commandant, Commanding Officers, regimental staff, other ranks and several parents, widowers and children of the fallen Gajaba war heroes attended the event.

Galle Face Hotel debuts King of the Mambo
King of the Mambo opened recently at the Galle Face Hotel this week with cocktails expertly mixed by an award-winning mixologist, Mediterranean-Cuban cuisine and live entertainment.

Were delighted to be bringing an authentic South American experience to Colombo, says Galle Face Hotel General Manager and Area Vice President Robert Hauck.
Galle Face Hotel hosted Che Guevara when he visited Sri Lanka in 1959, so introducing this concept in 2018 feels like were reconnecting with those heady days of the 50s when the mambo was all the rage around the world. Today we see a much more diverse and culturally rich Cuban influence on popular culture, and were excited to be tapping into that, he added.
The lounge-restaurant is casual but trendy with 50s style warm interiors accented by bold mementos to its Cuban influence. The space contains air conditioned as well as open-air sections with stunning vantage point views across the Indian Ocean; everything melding together to create the perfect ambience for evening cocktails and dancing overlooking the sunset.
King of the Mambos Italian chef makes the restaurants Mediterranean cuisine and Cuban signature dishes a highlight. In a resounding nod to the generosity of South American cuisine the menu contains many dishes that can be shared, like Tacos Dominicanos (beef rib tacos with sour cream and avocado guacamole) and Arroz a la cubana (rice smothered with tomato sauce, banana and fried egg). The space also features a large BBQ area for live cooking with specials such as Naranjito Braseao (woody salmon) and Media Vaca (a giant Tomahawk steak, big enough for six people).
At the bar, cocktails are mixed by the 2018 Hotel School flair bartending competition winner- an expert mixologist who understands the alchemy needed to craft a delicious cocktail from the premium quality beverages on the shelves- then served on custom made mugs of ceramic to reduce condensation.
King of the Mambo opens at noon every day, and service is open until late. The live entertainment is as essential as the cuisine, and takes place daily in the form of a band or DJ, with regular performances from Cuban entertainers. The lounge also houses a wine cellar designed especially for intimate wine tastings, and a tastefully decked out private karaoke room. For small, private events the space also contains an air-conditioned dining room that can seat 14. The venue can seat 170 persons overall.
Dubai-based Infini Concepts partnered with Galle Face Hotel to launch King of the Mambo, their first venue in Sri Lanka, with two more set to open in 2019.

CEO David Lescarret promises more to come from the restaurant, including regular promotions and Sunday brunch. For the moment, King of the Mambo opens with the promise of salty sea breeze-tinged evenings full of life, laughter and dancing on Colombos most iconic seafront property.

The government must make diplomatic efforts to withdraw the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka said yesterday.
He also said that these efforts should put the country in better light in the international arena.
The Minister said the present government has taken several reconciliation initiatives that would establish a solid foundation for fresh discussions in reference to the resolution.
He said the Office of Missing Persons, the Office for Reparation and several other commissions are some examples of such initiatives.
Minister Ranawaka was speaking when the Cabinet took up the Bill to set up the National Truth Commission for discussion.
Minister Ranawaka also said that the government should make efforts to re-explain the nature of terrorism that Sri Lanka had to undergo for three decades to the countries that have brought the resolution on Sri Lanka.
He said many countries are now more aware of terrorism with the first-hand experience they have received, than they were some decades ago.
Minister Ranawaka also said Sri Lanka should withdraw from the co-sponsorship of the resolution.

Rajshree Pathy founder director has created IDF (www.indiadesignforum.com) as a platform to promote discourse on social relevance of design, its commercial appeal and the innovations that drive it.
IDF held its design event in Sri Lanka (IDF Colombo) on October 18. The event took place at the Gallery Caf the former office premises of world-renowned Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa.
IDF Colombo included a series of discussions by a group of eminent regional and international design industry figures. The center of attraction of the event was inimitable inventor, creator, architect, designer and artistic director, the Frenchman Philippe Starck. He was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award as an honour for his contribution towards design industry, specifically within the South Asia region. The award was presented to Starck by the State Minister of Finance, Eran Wickramaratne.
This designer par excellence considers his duty is to share his pioneering vision of a fairer planet. He creates unconventional places and objects that are good before being beautiful with his motto in creativity, Making life better for the largest number of people possible.
In keeping with Starcks design ethos, IDF Colombo explored topics such as responsible luxury and the relevance of architecture in an era of sustainability, the significance of design in a rapidly urbanizing South Asia, the impact of globalization on local design practices and subaltern perspectives in architecture and design.
Madhura Prematilleke, principal at Team Architrave, a design practice in Colombo in his speech mentioned about Channa Daswatte the crown prince of Bawa legacy with other innovators in the local fraternity who are determined to take the Bawa tradition forward.

Heightened cancer risk in tall people: study
FRANCE: Taller people have a higher risk of cancer "hard wired" into them partly because they have more cells for the disease to target, a study claimed Wednesday.
Researchers in the US examined populations across three continents and found that the risk of contracting cancer for both men and women increased 10 percent for every 10 centimetres (four inches) in height.
Cancer develops when the body's normal controls on cell growth stop working, leading to the runaway creation of abnormal cells that manifests as tumours.
A study published in the journal Proceedings of Royal Society B suggests that the risk of several types of cancer is likely higher in taller humans simply because they have more cells, and therefore more opportunities for those cells to become cancerous.
"This means that this extra risk is 'hard wired' and cannot in any obvious way be reduced," lead study author Leonard Nunney of the University of California Riverside told AFP.
It is thought that some larger mammals such as elephants and giraffes -- whose bodies have a far greater number of cells than smaller creatures -- have evolved additional safeguards against cancer.
But there is no evidence that this works the same in individuals within a single species, such as humans.
Average height varies among regions but in the United States, men are on average 176 cm (five feet nine inches) tall, and women 162 cm (five feet four inches).
While scientists have known for a while that taller people tend to be at higher cancer risk, Nunney's study into human populations in the US, Europe and South Korea found that this may be because they have more cells in which something can go wrong.
In particular, taller people were shown to be at increased risk of melanoma because they have a higher rate of cell division -- and, simply, more skin -- than people of average height.
However, the risk of stomach, mouth and cervical cancer in women didn't seem to be affected by height.
While height is largely determined by an individual's genes, Nunney said that childhood environment also has an effect, and therefore likely impacts associated cancer risks.
"Environmental and genetic factors acting during childhood both have a strong effect on adult height," he said.
"There is no reason to believe that their effects on cancer risk would be different, since the driver is the number of cells, not why or how an individual ended up with a given number of cells."
Adulthood obesity is well known to increase an individual's risk of cancer, but for a very different reason to height.
Whereas a person's number of cells increases the taller they get, obesity changes the size of those cells rather than creating more.
"So we can expect the causation of any obesity-related increase in cancer risk to be different from the height effect," Nunney said.
He suggested there should be more research into why large mammals don't appear to have an elevated risk of cancer to see if they have some in-built cell protection that could be replicated in humans. - AFP

HelpAge teaches schoolchildren how to care
The message of caring for elders was brought to the attention of over 130 state schools principals by HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) at a seminar recently.
The objective of the seminar was to pass this message to schoolchildren through the principals. Zonal education directors in the Colombo district participated in the seminar.
Caring for elders and creating an environment for them to live with dignity was the theme of the seminar, conducted with funds granted by HelpAge International through the Sponsor a Grandparent (SAG) programme.
HASL Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge said 99 percent of elders in the country live with their families and it is the duty of children to look after them.
He said keeping in line with the religious and cultural values in Sri Lanka, HASL does not promote elders homes and requested students, through their principals, to extend love and care to their parents and grandparents without isolating them during the latter part of their lives.
Colombo Zonal Director G.N. Silva requested all school principals to pass this important message of caring for and providing much-needed protection for their parents and grandparents to schoolchildren.

Hopes heroics help West Indies tie second India ODI
Visakhapatnam, Wednesday: Centurion Shai Hope hit a last-ball boundary to help West Indies tie the second one-day international against India despite Indian skipper Virat Kohli's dazzling 157 on Wednesday.
Needing five runs on the final ball to chase down West Indies' target of 322, Hope -- who made a total of 123 -- got four off Indian paceman Umesh Yadav as the tourists ended on 321-7 in their 50 overs.
Earlier Kohli became the quickest batsman to reach 10,000 ODI runs on his way to his second successive century and help India amass 321-6 after electing to bat first. The hosts lead the five-match series 1-0.
Left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav claimed three wickets in what turned out to be the second tied game between the two sides.
The West Indies were in trouble at 78-3 when Hope infused life into their chase and put on 143 runs for the fourth wicket with Shimron Hetmyer, who blasted 94 off 64 deliveries.
The left-handed Hetmyer, who came into the match on the back of his 106 in the West Indies' opening loss, smashed four fours and seven sixes to unsettle the Indian bowlers.
Hetmyer though fell short of what would have been his fourth ODI ton after top edging one of Yuzvendra Chahal's leg spinners to get caught by Kohli at cover.
Hope then kept his calm to put together another 47-run crucial partnership with skipper Jason Holder to nearly pull off victory for the West Indies.
Hope, who registered his second ODI ton, kept chipping away despite some tight bowling by the Indian pacemen and Holder's run out.
But the day belonged to Kohli who reached 10,000 runs in his 205th innings as he surpassed fellow batting great Sachin Tendulkar, who first crossed the 10,000-run mark in 259 innings in 2001.
Kohli's heroics that came at the back of his 140 in India's opening win on Sunday.
Nicknamed "King Kohli", the prolific run-getter was dropped on 44 by his opposite number Jason Holder off debutant Obed McCoy and made full use of the reprieve.
He put on 139 runs for the third wicket with Ambati Rayudu, who made 73.
Rayudu took stock along with Kohli after India lost their openers for 40 as the batting duo rebuilt the innings and counter-attack. Rayudu was bowled by spinner Ashley Nurse.
It was an all Kohli show after that, with the star batsman hitting 13 fours and four sixes to take the steam out of the West Indies bowling attack.
Kohli took a single off Nurse to eclipse the 10,000-run mark, before going on to score a hundred with a boundary off Marlon Samuels.
He also got past 1,000 ODI runs in just 11 matches this year.
McCoy cleaned up Mahendra Singh Dhoni for 20 to claim his first ODI wicket and ended up with two scalps. Nurse was the pick of the West Indies bowlers with his figures of 2-46.
The third match is slated for Saturday in Pune. AFP

India to be third-largest economy - HSBC Research
India is likely to emerge as the third-largest economy in the world in just over a decade from now, surpassing Japan and Germany, according to a new report from HSBC Global Research. China is projected to be the largest economy in the world by 2030, followed by the US and India.
According to the report, the advanced economies of Denmark and Norway are likely to be the biggest losers in the coming decade, falling nine and ten positions on global rankings, respectively. On the other hand, as seen in Chart 2, countries like Bangladesh and the Philippines will be the biggest gainers over this period.
In part, these countries, along with India, will benefit from the demographic dividend. These countries will have a faster-growing working-age population (Chart 3) and young people should become more productive particularly as education rates continue to rise across the emerging economies.
Thus the report argues that countries which have a low starting point in terms of level of GDP per capita and have favourable demographics should grow reasonably quickly as long as other components of growth are in place. As seen in Chart 5, it estimates that the fastest-growing countries will be those in the middle of the top-left quadrant, namely  India, Bangladesh and Vietnam.
At the aggregate level, the report expects the world economy to grow at just below 3 per cent (Chart 6). But the drivers of growth will have changed. As seen in Chart 7, while over the past decade, emerging economies accounted for about half of global growth, over the coming decade, roughly 70 per cent of global growth will be from emerging economies.

Iron  Man  gets a new weapon  in Avengers 4
The release of 'Avengers 4' (A4) is a long way off in mid-2019, but it has triggered off numerous speculations and theories. While there have been speculation of key heroes sacrificing themselves to bring other superheroes back from the dead, there is another new theory floating around. Since Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is fighting against the super villain Thanos, who seems invincible as he has the Infinity Gauntlet with which he destroyed half the population, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) is likely to get a new weapon. Fans speculate that the weapon has its origins in the video game series 'Marvel vs Capcom' and seems to be the only likely weapon that can defeat Thanos.
The weapon speculation reportedly took off when directors, Joe and Anthony Russo shared an image a while back. The weapon looks quite similar to the proton cannon that Iron Man wielded in 'Marvel vs Capcom' video game series. This weapon was used as Iron Mans special move in the game.
Said to be the final installment of the Avengers series, A4 is slated to release in May 2019.

Island rugby hearts that beat as one and dreaming big!
Rugby traditions throughout the Asia Pacific islands are wonderfully peculiar, distinct, remarkable and a glorious dialect shared by all who live the code.
The Sri passion for the game links us closer than we imagine with Japan, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Vanavatu, Cook Islands, Papua New Guinea, Guam etc...
We all speak rugby and live that extreme Spartan discipline despite our obvious geography and cultures.
Rugby links us and is almost an umbilical framework of shared ambitions.
It really is up to all these amazing island unions to join hands for the future of our game.
The need is both technical and financially a most viable blueprint for success without too much stress.
How fantastic for all these islands to initiate their own island 7s series for men and women, plus a 15s tournament that captures the imagination.
Junior rugby from U15 up will hugely impact the quality, skill levels and confidence of our Sri game right across all grades, and all formats.
Lets just cast the minds eye and morph into an operational tours agreement for 7s and 15s.
The dream for island rugby is too fabulous and massively needed, especially for Sri Lankas future in the game and our Asian performance platform.
Our Sri islanders have to grade up and new bottle to face our delightful skilled island brothers and sisters.
Lets hope the big pencils that occupy the long halls of fame...see the wisdom in our future skill levels that automatically grow confidence like breathing fresh oxygen.
Consider our 7s teams on an island series ...2020 ideal to start.
We set a 12 team 7s in Fiji or Samoa with a return leg in Sri Lanka.
An invitation format that gives the likes of Muthu, Sooriyabandara, Danushka Ranjan, Naveen Heenak, Jason, Gayan Weeray, Dixon, Dinuk, Shenal, Sudam, Kavindu, Omalka etc.
Grit, guts, courage, total survival on their skills under pressure...lining up against, Samoa, Cook Islands, Tonga...then Fiji and Japan etc...
Think impact, skills, learning and pure survival.
Our 7s upgrades in one swoop...no passengers, no baggage.
Initially mega tough, but the learning and pressure ...pure platinum for our players to adapt adjust and step up on extreme survival.
Our Asian ranking for both ...too static and seemingly stuck for the last 5 years.
Time to cut away from conventional dull thinking ...new energy, new strategy, new practical thinking and definitely the only way forward.
Our 7s men and women need heaps of exposure to sharpen reaction response etc....and develop their abilities under pressure.
Not only are players and teams forced to adapt.
Coaching staff and management under pressure too.
We are far too predictable...both in attack and defence.
Our running lines, support play and finishing, far too straight for my deckchair expert pondering.
Grab the best stats of the top 5 in the world...and familiar ability for spontaneous punishment when opponents hesitate or make mistakes.
Couple this with their relentless fitness and huge recovery ...max finishing is a telling fact of simple confidence and empowering hunger to be the best.
Sri Lanka rugby, I believe is on the brink of world recognition.
This generation is uniquely positioned to strike at the heart of that hallowed sanctum.
Time to back our ambitions with special clout.
Enough praise for the champion nations...good timing for our skills to command respect and shine...shine...shine.
Bula bula Sri api and the new dream for our warriors.

Kandy Youth SC to organize tournament in memory of EW Balasuriya
Kandy Youth Sports Club are organizing a rugby, cricket and football tournament in memory of E. W. Balasuriya who was a great benefactor of Kandy sports and whose contributions should be weighed in gold. Today many seem to have forgotten those past glorious moments that Balasuriya brought to sports in Kandy. But fortunately there are still a few who remember the part played by promoters such as Bala or EW as he was fondly called. Balasuriya was the founder of Kandy Lake Club and Kandy RFC. These two clubs produced top sportsmen in rugby, cricket and iron sports. EW was a product of Dharmaraja College and Ananda College, where he excelled in cricket, as a fine left hand opening batsman.
The first sport he started was cricket and some of the players were Bertie Gomes, Neville Heritage, D. D. de Alles, M. E. Marker, Z. M. Zeros and P. Pries to name a few. Most of these players played for Up-Country and Central Province.
He was at one time the secretary of the Central Province Cricket Association and the first who organized the first international cricket match after Sri Lanka won Test status in Kandy. At one time he was also in the BCCL Ex-Co.
The second sport introduced by EW to the club was rugby in 1963. They played in the inter club B division tournament. The side was led by an Antonian Niyaz Majeed, some of the top sports lovers who helped EW in this sport was Col. Stanley Ratwatte, Noel Paranagama, Dr. C.D.L. Fernando, Sidney Ratwatte and Maurice Perera, the last two named were the coaches.
Kandy Lake Clubs first rugby team was made out of products from Trinity, St. Anthonys, Vidyartha, St. Sylvesters and St. Pauls now Sri Sumangala. Due to the support and the good work, in three years EW turned out a champion team that had players like TB Wijesinghe who led the side, a top wing- three-quarter. After seeing him playing against CR Bees, CR and FC absorbed him and half way during the season, so the captaincy went to Farook Dole. uncle of present Sri Lanka Rugby selection committee chairman Rohan Abeyakoon. They were unbeaten till the last match against NCC which they lost. The following year 1967 they were promoted to A division and played alongside clubs like Havelock SC, Kandy SC, Dimbulla A & CC, Dickoya MMC, Uva, KV, CH and FC, CR and FC and Army SC. In the very first year they were placed third in the A Division League table, behind Havelock SC and CR and FC. A few years later the club was suspended by the controlling body for having professional players, today even the forces have professionals playing for them.
E.W. continued the good work as he and his friends like Col. Stanley Ratwatte, Dr. C. D. L. Fernando and Dr. Dago Gunawardene started the Kandy Rugby Football Club KRFC. Some of the new rugby faces who joined the old were Alex Lazarus, Nihal Jayatilake, Jadi Dissanayake, Iswan Oman and Shafie Jainudeen.
In the mid 1970s Kandy SC was not that good at winning matches, most of the players were planters and could not attend practices, some young ruggerites come for practices but when the matches are played the planters get selected even without turning up for practice. Seeing this downfall one time Sri Lanka and Kandy SC president Dr. K.B. Sangakkara suggested to E.W. to amalgamate Kandy RFC with Kandy SC and play under one banner. E.W. agreed and they played under one name Kandy Sports Club from 1974 with the Kandy SC jersey and Kandy RFC colour on the stockings.
The following year 1975 E.W. became the president and the first Kandy RFC player to captain Kandy SC was Iswan Omar. E.W. continued to help Kandy SC as its patron, till his death.

KHASHOGGI KILLING: U.S. revokes visas for two dozen Saudis
US: The United States announced Tuesday that it was revoking visas of nearly two dozen Saudi officials involved in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, in the toughest action to date against its longtime ally.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States has identified at least some of the individuals behind the death of the Washington Post opinion writer in Saudi Arabias Istanbul consulate.
These penalties will not be the last word on this matter from the United States. We will continue to explore additional measures to hold those accountable, Pompeo told reporters.
We are making very clear that the United States does not tolerate this kind of action to silence Mr. Khashoggi, a journalist, through violence, he said.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert later said that the measure will affect 21 Saudi suspects who will either have their visas revoked or be ineligible for future visas.
Pompeo said that the Saudis came from the intelligence services, the royal court, the foreign ministry and other Saudi ministries.
The top diplomat said the United States was also looking into whether to take action under a law named after Sergei Magnitsky, the anti-corruption accountant who died in Russian custody, that would impose financial sanctions on individuals behind Khashoggis death. US lawmakers have been pressing President Donald Trumps administration to take tough action, with several mentioning the Magnitsky Act.
Pompeo reiterated that the United States still considered Saudi Arabia an ally, saying he and Trump were not happy to move against the kingdom.

Lankatiles invests Rs. 2.5 bn for expansion
Lanka Walltiles and Lankatiles PLC added 6,000 more square meters of production to capacity, at a cost of Rs. 2.5 billion, in their factory complex in Ranala.
This was highlighted by Mahendra Jayasekera, Managing Director of Lanka Walltiles and Lankatiles PLC.
He weighs in on the contribution of Lankatiles to the export economy as the only export brand from Sri Lanka to bear the countrys name, and its vision for the future.
Following is an interview with Mahendra Jayasekera.
Q: Can you briefly recount to us the history of Lankatiles
A: As you know, Lankatiles was started in 1984. We went through several expansion phases. Right now, we are producing 13,000 square meters of floor tiles and 7,500 square meters of wall tiles a day. But when considering the true history of the organisation, we have to go back to 1976, when we established the Lanka Walltiles factory in Balangoda. So the tile business in our organisation is 42 years old, while Lankatiles as a brand is 34 years old.
When we began production, the tile industry in Sri Lanka was virtually non-existent. We started out as an export oriented venture. I dont think we sold even five percent of what we manufactured to the local market then. People were not really aware of what tiles could do to their households.
And then, of course, we began to promote the use of tiles in the domestic market. Demand picked up. What happened was that more and more houses began installing floor and wall tiles. Initially, this was an upmarket niche, the more affluent market limited mostly to Colombo. As the economy and the population grew, tiles became a primary need of everyone. However, even with this, our tile penetration hovers between 30 and 40 percent.
Q: What has the contribution of Lankatiles towards Sri Lankas export economy been
A: We were the pioneer manufacturer and exporter of tiles in this country. We currently export around 20 percent of our production capacity to overseas high quality markets such as Japan, Canada, Australia and certain countries in the European Union.
Talking about the present, the main milestone as regards exports is the fact that we have ventured outside Sri Lanka, to produce tiles under our brand and our specifications. Currently, therefore, we are exporting not only what we manufacture in Sri Lanka, but what our staff go and manufacture in overseas factories as well.
Q: Reflecting all these, how have the investments of your organisation changed
A: With the profits we have been making over the last 30 or so years, we have ventured out and diversified. We have many business interests under the group now, encompassing investments in aluminium, tile adhesive, plantations, packaging and so on. We have a portfolio of such investments, financed mainly through our internally generated profits.
In our most recent expansion, we added 6,000 more square meters of production to our capacity, at a cost of Rs. 2.5 billion, at our factory complex in Ranala. Our expectation with this is to remain a dominant player in the local market, and to give a better product to our local and overseas buyers.
Q: Linked to these changes, what have the latest developments in the organisation been in terms of business interests, skills and technology transfers and so on
A: I am proud to say that we have made a consistent commitment to being up to date with the latest trends of the global industry. You must understand that the tile industry develops at a very rapid rate. The machines you purchase today, for instance, will be obsolete in two years. So you have to keep investing to keep abreast of the rate at which the industry is developing.
Q: In conclusion, what is your vision for the future
A: We are Sri Lankas largest manufacturer of floor and wall tiles. We are the biggest exporter of tiles from Sri Lanka as well. What we want to do now is to go overseas and start manufacturing products which we cannot manufacture in our country.We are the only truly global brand from Sri Lanka that bears the name Lanka. I say with no hesitation that there is no other such export brand bearing our countrys name, from any industry. I cannot emphasise on this enough.
Whether manufactured locally or globally, tiles from Lankatiles stick to our time tested, uniform standard. That is how we want to become a global player. That is why our latest endeavours are so significant, because they represent a big leap forward for our organisation and the market as a whole.
We took the best of Sri Lanka to the rest of the world. We are now bringing the best of the world to Sri Lanka, and beyond. We manufacture locally as well as overseas, and we export our products to the rest of the world. It is a brand that is globally recognised for quality.

LRT to get moving by end 2019
Construction of the proposed Light Railway Project (LRT) worth USD 1.6 bn will begin by end next year, Megalopolis and Western Development Ministry Secretary Nihal Rupasinghe said yesterday. He said the feasibility study of one of the railway tracks has been concluded and the pre-operational services for its construction will commence this November. This railway track is funded through JAICA by the Japanese government.
This railway track will operate from the Malabe multimodal transport hub to Pettah with 17 stations and trains operating every six minutes.The LRT system which includes seven railway tracks will be one of the largest funded projects in the country and will cover the whole of Colombo and its suburbs.
The trains operating in the LRT can be extended by adding more compartments to facilitate more passengers if and when needed.
Ministry Additional Secretary Madhawa Waidyaratne said that the Ministry expects to construct the other six railway tracks under three packages as a Private Public Partnership.
The Ministry will select six foreign companies out of 17 that have submitted tenders for the project. The Ministry has allowed those companies until the end of February 2019 to submit their bids for the project.
Waidyaratne explained that one of the lines with a total distance of 33km would be constructed from Ragama to Kirulapone via Kadawatha, Fort and Bambalapitiya. The Green Line, 28.3km in length, would be constructed from Kelaniya to Moratuwa via Dematagoda, Borella, Narahenpita and Nugegoda. 22.3 km long Blue Line would be constructed from Hunupitiya Tyre Junction to Kottawa via Koswatte.

## Title: National Budget
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

National Budget
Everybody wants the support of the government to have a good life. On one hand, economists recommend the government to fix all macroeconomic ills whether it is general inflation or high cost of living or low economic growth or balance of payment (BOP) deficit or currency depreciation or unemployment or household income disparity or elephant attacks (or human attacks on elephants) or recovery from wars or disasters (floods, droughts, earthquakes) or social backwardness. On the other hand, they all find the government as the scapegoat for all those ills, social and economic. Everything we tell the government to do or what it does will end up in the national budget, mostly as expenditure and debt, as things we propose for income are virtually rare.
Some ambitious economists, while telling the government to fix structural economic problems such as chronic balance of payments deficits or poor exports or inflation, they simultaneously recommend the government to scale down the budget as the solution. Nobody seems to talk about how various segments of the public benefit economically and socially from the budget or its actual socio-economic impact when the budget is criticized. The budget is the reflection of the size and the quality of the Public Service in the country. Therefore, before we criticize the budget, we have to assess its socio-economic impact and whether it is justified, given the circumstances applicable to the country.
In economics, the budget is the top macroeconomic policy or the fiscal policy implemented to influence the aggregate demand (total spending on consumption and investments) in the economy for promoting growth, employment, resource utilization, etc., and setting the socio-economic policy of the country. The other macroeconomic policy assigned to the Central Bank (CB) is the monetary policy to regulate the monetary side of the economy for same economic objectives, generally independent of the government, but with close coordination to avoid policy conflicts.
Budget Number Crunching
Both compilation and analysis of the budget are necessarily a number-crunching exercise for the future, similar to the budget of a person or a household or an institution.
* Information Problem
Its quality depends on the information system at micro level on all activities, expenses, incomes, debt profile, operational targets, etc. If budget estimates are not based on reliable set of such information, the estimates will be nothing but adding some hypothetical changes to existing budget numbers. Generally, people over-estimate expenses and under-estimate income or vice versa, depending on the motives. In general, actual outcome is worse than the budget as proved by several supplementary budgets and revised budgets. Therefore, budget numbers could be highly misrepresentative unless information reporting systems are maintained, audited and verified for reliability.
* Budget Structure
The budget provides numbers on receipts, expenses and financing which reflect the size and nature of the fiscal front and immediate financial impact on the public with details on activities covered in the budget. Receipts are the proceeds of taxes and grants. Expenses are the recurrent expenses and investment expenses (new capital). The overall budget is the gap between total receipts and total expenses that requires financing, i.e., borrowing in the case of deficit and lending in the case of surplus. The financing or mostly borrowing is classified by sources such as foreign and domestic and by borrowing instruments such as market, project and others to assess the composition, concentrations and possible risks of debt. The actual borrowing during the year is much higher as borrowing is reported as net of repayment of debt (inclusive of roll-overs) which is not reported as an expense.
* Budget Numbers Analysis
Several concepts are used to assess direct financial plight of the budget. The current account, primary account and overall budget are used to understand the plight of the budget gap. The current account is the gap between the income (without proceeds of grants) and recurrent expenses (without investment-related expenses) which shows whether the income is adequate to finance routine expenses such as salaries and maintenance. Primary account which is the gap between the total receipts (income and grants) and total expenses excluding interest payments on debt stock shows interest cost excluded- budget gap. When the overall budget is a big gap, above sub-gaps are meaningless.
While the numbers are commented in absolute terms, their percentages against the countrys income (or GDP) are mostly used by economists to analyze in relative magnitudes. We should not forget controversies surrounding the GDP numbers on account of alleged creative accounting methods when such percentages are used.
Deficit budget is a global macroeconomic policy standard unless the deficit is horribly high with fiscal expenses dominating the economy over decades that will end up in catastrophes. See Table
Budgets Socio-economic Impact Assessment
All income, expenses and borrowing have beneficial effects as well as adverse effects to various categories of the public. What is underlying the budget is the wider public service that arouses such effects. Public service broadly covers all government operations such as policies, business stimuluses, regulations, business enterprises, infrastructure facilities and social safety net. Therefore, for making a reasonably objective and impartial impact assessment, we need a list of all public services, their net cash flows, respective service deliverables, targets set for respective deliverables at the time of making budget estimates and performance status on such targets within the budget year or a reasonably long period given to cover lactation periods of budget items and policies.
Our budget offices do not have such information other than budget numbers and actuals. No such performance information is presented at the time of the presentation of the budget to the Parliament. Therefore, we need to find some proxies/indicators to be fair by the government and general public, given their non-macroeconomic profiles. I provide few numbers below to arouse further research. All numbers are for 2017 extracted and computed by me from the CBs publications.
* Generation of Employment
Total government spending, 19% of GDP or countrys total spending, boosts economic activities and employment. Direct employment in the public service funded by 19% of the countrys spending is 1.4 mn or 14.4% of the total employment in the country. The private spending which dominates the economy with a share of 81% generated nearly 6.8 mn jobs. Accordingly, direct employment generation ability in the public sector is lower than that in the private sector, i.e. government spending of 1% of GDP generates 72,000 direct jobs in the public sector as compared to 84,500 private sector jobs per its spending of 1% of GDP. However, the indirect employment created in the private sector by the budgetary policies, purchase of goods and services and implementation of public tendered protects should be a sizable number. Still, public spending being 19% may not be an excessive or unmanageable level, given the countless projects expected by the public from the government.
* Supply of Economic Infrastructure
The state supplied infrastructure is the key for the economy. Road network maintained by the government to support the economy is nearly 32,800 kms. The railways operated service of 11.7 mn kms facilitated136mnof passenger journeys at a subsidy of Rs. 7.6 bn. Paddy area cultivated on state irrigation service is nearly 792,000 hectares or 80% of total paddy area which produces nearly 4.4 million MT of paddy with a yield of nearly 4,300 kg per hectare for self-sufficiency in rice being the staple food. The irrigated area for other field crops under Mahaweli scheme is nearly 24,000 hectares along with the paddy area constituting 12% of total paddy area in the country. If not for such irrigation, the country would not have a domestic agriculture sector by now. The state electricity capacity is nearly 2,890 MW or 70% of the total capacity in the country. The forest cover is maintained at nearly 1.9 million hectares to keep the climate and environment balance.
* Support for Human Resource
Human resource side, state health and education provided at low price in increasing volumes decide the quality of human resource base in the country. State student population reached 4.2 mn supported by state employment in education rising to 258,000 while general education expenditure vote rose to Rs. 19,460 per student. These are good performance numbers at any standard. The quality of the education and employability of students are different technical subjects. As regards health service, treatment for 60 mn patients (nearly three times of each person in population) at a low annual price of Rs. 3,300 per patient supported by health employment of 64,600 is a significant performance. Good health and education are unique returns to any country.
* Control of Cost of Living
The cost of living and thereby overall inflation is kept low by administered prices and subsidized prices and costs. Many commodities and services in the household consumer basket are at administratively controlled prices with virtually free health and education services. Various production subsidies keep the cost at low. If not for such cost of living support, the countrys inflation and wage demands would be greater and affect adversely the export competitiveness and economic growth. The budget can control the inflation overnight within the broader macroeconomic policy as against the intellectual model-based monetary policy of the CB with unknown long-lags.
* Maintenance of Socio-economic Safety Net
The government being the guardian of the society provides numerous services to keep the social balance and justice under check. The basic role of governments is to provide a stable environment for the economy. Everybody knows how civil wars and societal insecurity would produce economic and social catastrophes. The government spends 29% of its spending or 5.7% of GDP or Rs. 35,280 per person on civil administration and defense to prevent such catastrophes. Nearly 325,900 births and 139,400 deaths with post-mortems were registered to keep track of the population care.
Subsidies have been increased to 28% of the budget with nearly a half to households amounting to Rs.16,300 per person of population (total subsidies-Rs. 33,280 per person) with Samurdhi subsidy of Rs. 40 bn for nearly 1.4 mn families. Economists criticize subsidies on its economic meaning in market economies without assessing its socio-economic role although the government is not a business enterprise.
* Provision of Safest Financial Investments
Government debt is the safest investment avenue to the public. Increase in domestic debt by Rs. 3 trillion or 2% of GDP between 2010 and 2017 is a significant increase in safest investments of the domestic public. This is why economists allege that protracted budget deficits crowd out private investments as private savers move to safer investments in government debt. Meantime, foreign debt provides a firm source of foreign capital inflow to finance the chronic BOP deficits as private capital inflow is low and not reliable. The increase in foreign debt by an estimated US$ 15.2 bn between 2017 and 2010 was a great comfort to the stability of the economy.
The CB desperately depends on the governments foreign borrowing to do its duty on the maintenance of the international stability of the currency. Further, the CB carries out monetary operations in the inter-bank market based on government securities and further printing of money by granting credit/loans to the government by way of advances and purchase of government securities. On average, nearly 25%of the increase in money in circulation (money M2) was created by bank credit granted to the government. Meanwhile, nearly 21% of new money printed by the CB was its credit granted to the government. If not for government debt, the CB has to print this amount of money by credit granted on risky private securities taken as collaterals.
The financial dealing industry makes income and profit on debt-trades. As reported by the CB, the primary dealers alone made nearly Rs. 13.4 bn of profit on trade of government securities of value Rs. 17 trillion (primary market: 1.6 trillion, secondary market: 15.4 trillion) (i.e., a post-tax dealer net margin of 0.078%, increased from 0.067 in 2016) although the dealers total income was not reported.
Fundamental Problem  The Budget or the Public Service Delivery System underlying the Budget
Most analysts criticize both the budget and government without research on socio-economic impact of the budget in the context of its macroeconomic management policy role. Accumulating debt stock, inefficiency of the public service and poor government revenue are the cornerstones for such criticism. These relate to issues on the budget administrators and not on the budget per se.
* Concern on Debt Accumulation
Whether debt stock is too high or economically and socially justifiable has to be assessed on different economic criteria (See my article on public debt in Daily News 26.09.2018) where just the debt number 77% or 100% or 200% of GDP does not have any economic meaning, given its economic role in debt-financed-macroeconomies.
* Concern on Poor Quality of Public Service
This has to be assessed in the context whether the private sector or the market mechanism is ready to govern the economy and society and provide more productive economic environment. The poor service quality is a problem of the state bureaucracy or those who manage public institutions. If the management of public institutions is assigned as the return to those who undertake political funding or those with permanent foot-prints aboard or spending most part of the year in foreign travels at public funds while leaving out best talents created by the public education, nobody can expect a quality public service for the country.
* Concern on Insufficient Revenue
It is the fundamental problem of low price charged on public service than the cost and evasion of paying the price (tax) by those who are due. If the price or tax rate is 12% to 14% of GDP while incurring a cost of 17% to 20% of GDP, the resulting cash flow deficit of 5% to 6% of GDP is annual rate of debt add-on. The leakage of budget/public funds from both the source (collection) and use (spending) is well known. Although the Inland Revenue estimates tax in default as Rs. 197 bn. as at end of 2017, professional lawyers and accountants know well that it is much more due to creative accounting techniques and legal interpretation of business transactions subject to tax due to confusing tax circulars being a problem world over.
A CBs Senior Deputy Governor commented at a Parliamentary Finance Committee in July 2017, when discussing means to raise tax collection, that tax revenue cannot be raised unless national income increases. The Committee chair being a good practical economist responded that the matter was for improvement of revenue collection on exiting national income. Although I, as another Deputy Governor at that time, calcified the urgent need for a system to prevent colossal evasion/robbery of stamp duties on land transactions, at least by making aware the public of the due procedure for payment of stamp duties and deed registrations. I am sure there is capable parliamentarians and public servants who can fix this revenue problem though excessively painful.
In addition, the budget administrators do not have a macroeconomic policy framework for the budget and, therefore, ad-hoc decisions taken to favour segments of the public focusing on vote-base targets dominate the budget.
Macro Demand Management in the Economy
In macroeconomics, fiscal expansion and monetary expansion are the policies recommended to increase or fine-tune the total spending (consumption and investments) in the economy which will have several rounds of multiplier effects on spending, production, employment, interest rates and inflation. Advanced economies have been adopting both in the past decade to recover from the recession caused by the last global financial crisis 2007/09. In general, emerging market economies follow expansionary demand policies in both fiscal policy and monetary policy to promote economic activities although the rate of expansion may vary.
Monetary and Fiscal Policy Impact
The eventual economic impact of both policies has not been quantified separately or in aggregate in the CBs macroeconomic models as they cant detect separately the lagged effects of policies, supply side changes and other external shocks to the economy. Unlike monetary policy for regulation of overall expansion of money supply and credit to cause an indirect impact on the aggregate demand, the fiscal policy has sectoral and fast effects as spending is made fast on identified activities. For example, recurrent expense, i.e., 75% of total fiscal spending, takes no time to push the aggregate demand.
Policy Stimulus in 2017
The fiscal expansion/stimulus keeps the economy growing and out of recession. For example, total expansion through both fiscal deficit and increase in money supply (M2) to private sector (net of fiscal borrowing from banks to eliminate the double counting as money supply contains fiscal borrowings from banks) was 11% of GDP in 2017. The fiscal stimulus/deficit constituted nearly 52% of the total expansion/stimulus (The balance being the private sector funded by the monetary policy). In fact, the CBs money printing (i.e., increase in its balance sheet) has not been a reliable source to expand the monetary base and, therefore, bank-created money facilitates the economy. On year-end basis, CBs new money printing has decelerated to Rs. 76 bn in 2017(due to faster monetary tightening adopted since January 2016, despite the slack of the economy) and highly fluctuated between Rs. 103 bn to Rs.218 bn during the past 6 years where a net absorption (a decline) of Rs. 38 bn was reported in each 2013 and 2015. See Graphic
Economic Recession if not for Fiscal Stimulus
In this context, if fiscal expansion had been cut-down in the recent past as some economists propose, the economy could be suffering from the protracted recession by now, given the fact that the growth has been continuously low (3%-5%)even with such fiscal expansion. This indicates that the private sector is still not able to generate a level of spending (consumption and investments) to boost the economy even with prevailing level of fiscal spending. As the demand/spending has to come from credit, the credit delivery mechanism (intermediation and private credit markets) has not developed to create a flow of credit friendly to business environment. Therefore, the reduction of fiscal front is not feasible without confronting a recession or slower growth and employment.
Some argue to cut the fiscal front to fix the current problem of excessive currency depreciation on the basis of theoretical macroeconomic calculation that budget deficit always accompanies a current account deficit in the BOP and/or private net savings (savings less investments) which are the sources to finance the budget deficit. The two-handed economists know that the economy will confront a severe recession and wide market imbalances if the fiscal front is cut in this argument.
I recommend that the national budget officers have a list of public services, their net cash flows and service targets achieved to justify the economics of the budget professionally and counter-critics on the budget, at least to be fair by those critics. The Auditor General and internal audits will verify the information reporting/number crunching systems underlying the budget for good governance of statistics.
These are not rocket sciences but the use of common sense objectively in the national interest. Budget officers, official financial advisers and debt managers to the government can get spiced up to make quality decisions for national economic management if they listen, at no cost, to veteran business leaders such as Dhammika Perera, Soli Captain, Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffet, Jac Ma, Satya Nadella and many others how they resolve business problems/bottlenecks and innovate businesses without any complaints to the public.

Niki Lauda leaves hospital  after lung transplant
Vienna, Wednesday: Three-time Formula One champion Niki Lauda left Vienna's general hospital on Wednesday around two and a half months after an emergency lung transplant, the hospital said in a statement.
It added that he left "in a good overall state of health".
"Niki Lauda will have to undergo an intensive course of rehabilitation over several weeks," the statement said, adding that he would continue to receive treatment from the medical team that had cared for him thus far.
Now 69, Lauda was crowned world champion for the first time in 1975 and cheated death the following year in a horrific crash at the German Grand Prix at the Nuerburgring which left him with severe burns.
He cut short a holiday in Ibiza at the end of July and returned to Vienna for treatment after developing a lung infection.
He was made a priority for a transplant after having to be put on an artificial lung.
Lauda is a non-executive chairman of Mercedes' Formula One operation and before his illness was a regular presence in the Grand Prix paddocks around the world.
Lauda is also very active in aviation - in January he bought back his old airline Niki, renaming it LaudaMotion but going on to sell a majority stake to Irish low-cost operator Ryanair two months later.
In the 1976 accident Lauda stayed in his burning vehicle for almost a minute before being pulled out.
Since then Lauda has suffered from the after-effects of the toxic gases he inhaled in the accident and also required kidney transplants in 1997 and 2005. AFP

Norwood landslide: Road to be restored before Deepavali
The Hatton - Bogawantalawa road would be restored before Deepavali celebrations commence, Nuwara Eliya Road Development Authority Chief Engineer K.M. Thilakaratna said.
A section of the New Weligama village on the Hatton - Bogawantalawa - Maskeliya road sank into the Castlereigh Reservoir on October 13, disrupting traffic and causing commuters to take alternative routes.
It had been planned to begin reconstruction work a few days ago, but the National Building Construction Organisation (NBRO) had discontinued the work as they believed it would have triggered another landslide.
Nuwara Eliya District Secretary Rohana Pushpa Kumara said that measures were taken to construct a new road near to where the old one was located, after removing loose soil layers.
Residents said that they had to travel an additional three kilometres through tea estates to reach Norwood.

Not just  a piece of cake
In a time and age when weddings have become unwieldy and complex, it is but natural to suppose the spotlight is on the couples garb or perhaps their choice of location. However, with cake boutiques burgeoning around the country, the cake has become the focal point at weddings.
Gone are the days when cakes had to be round, square or oval. There is no room for dummy cakes at weddings anymore. Wedding cakes have metamorphosed from cream-smattered blobs to works of art. Modern minimalist designs are in and quite a few brides like sugarcraft flowers on their wedding cake. Edible lace cakes have also made a big impression.
When you look at how skillfully he creates a Baptismal Cake or decorates a wedding cake you would not believe how Yohan Dhanuska Croos Pulles deft fingers knead, pleat and sculpt till the likes of rose petals, leaves and lace designs come alive in delectable detail.
The youth has quite a number of awards up his sleeve, the latest being the gold medal in the Challenge 2018 competition in the Special Occasion Cake Open class category held in Sydney Australia. Around 110 contestants competed at the event from countries like China, Thailand, Australia and New Zealand. Organised by the Cake Decorating Guild of New South Wales (NSW) the event proved that attractive cakes can up the ante of any gathering. Yohans presentation, a Baptismal Cake portraying a church and a newborn, was the center of attraction in the event category because of its originality and creativity.
My Baptismal Cake was included in the Welcome the Baby category. The dcor is made with royal icing. The flowers and leaves at the base of the cake and the church design are made of parchment. The cake is covered by a layer of fondant. I used mainly pink and white shades with a hint of green for the rose leaves. Everything was edible. I won points for difficulty and creativity, Yohan explained.
An old boy of Maris Stella College, Negombo, Yohan had ventured to Italy to join his parents. He has taken up studies in the Commerce stream at first but destiny lead him into the hotel trade later.
We are allowed to decide upon our future profession in a span of five years. I studied at the Carlo Porta Hotel School in Milan. Since I chose to master the kitchen side, the first lesson I was given was on sacrifice. We have to be on the job even on holiday seasons like Christmas and the New Year when everyone else is off and enjoying the holiday spirit. I trained on the Hot Kitchen category for three years. We had a three months break. I came to Sri Lanka during that time and followed R L Clements PME Professional Diploma course. I started making cakes when I was 19, he said.
One of the words of wisdom that Clement has given the youth was to take part in international cake decorating competitions. He had said that this will not only give him recognition but will hone his talents as well.
He stressed that certificates alone will not take you far in this sector. The first competition I took part in is Malmee 2011. I won the Best in the Show and the Gold Medal, he said adding that he had presented a wedding cake and a novelty cake at the event. The wedding cake structure won him the Best in the Show award.
Cake International: The Sugarcraft, Cake Decorating and Baking Show 2013 was his first international competition. It was held in Birmingham, Italy. Yohan won a Silver Medal in the wedding cake category for his structure on the sea theme and a merit certificate for the Shoe and Handbag category at the event. He took part in Cake International: The Sugarcraft, Cake Decorating and Baking Show 2014 in London, UK, the following year. He presented a wedding cake structure and an anniversary cake structure for the event and won a Silver Medal and a Bronze Medal for his work. In 2015 he presented a wedding cake structure for the Sugar festival held in Milan, Italy, and clinched a Gold Medal as well as the Best in the Show trophy, competing with around 250 cake structures.
After handling the dessert side in a restaurant chain in Italy Yohan returned to Sri Lanka in 2015. He joined The Grand Hotel, Nuwara Eliya, in 2016 as their cake decorator.
Yohan had originally planned to present a cake for the wedding cake category of the Challenge 2018 competition as well. However he had been short of time since he had to fulfill his employment duties while preparing for the event. Therefore he dropped out of the wedding cake category and focused purely on the Special Occasion Cake.
I was the contestant who had travelled the most distance to take part in Challenge 2018. I made the cake in Sri Lanka and then took it to Australia and decorated it there. The judges come to review your work while we are setting up our structure. They question us if they have any doubts. I lost some points during the Cake International: The Sugar craft, Cake Decorating and Baking Show 2014 because I had used a pin for my base in my creation when we were asked to use purely edible products, he recalled.
Yohan says that the most challenging thing about cake decorating is dealing with royal icing decorations because they are very fragile.
If you do not handle them carefully they are likely to get damaged even before you place them on the cake. You need to look into other factors like the room temperature when you decorate a cake. I am still a novice in the field so I seek Clements expertise when I decide to take part in a competition. I explain my ideas to him and he adds more inspiration to it. He actually advised me to make a structure of a church with a baby for the Baptismal Cake, Yohan said adding that you need a lot of patience when you deal with Royal Icing.
A cake will last about three or four days outdoors in Sri Lanka while it can be kept in a hot cupboard for a longer span.
One of the most common misconceptions about a cake structure is that if it is tall, it is a good product. I too was misled about this idea till I began training in the field. There is much more to a quality cake structure than its height and width. You need to look into details like the shading on a flower and how close to reality it is to decide on its quality, he expressed.
Out of all his cake structures the wedding cake he has done according to the sea theme is his favourite. He says that he also likes the Baptismal Cake which won him his latest award. He also admired a cake which displayed two themes while it rotated while it was on display at International: The Sugarcraft, Cake Decorating and Baking Show 2014.
Yohan is currently employed at the Sri Lanka Catering Services at the Bandaranaike International Airport. He handles the pasty section for the company. His father, Ivan Royeston Croos Pulle, is an Ayurvedic doctor. His mother is Milani Croos Pulle. His wife, Hasara Fernando, is an English teacher.
His next goal is to master the Isomalt technique and introduce it to the Sri Lankan bake enthusiasts.
It is always better to seek the advice of a more experienced person rather than depending on your own knowledge. This will help you to enhance your ideas and better yourself, he concluded with a smile.

Over 8 mn metric tons of plastic waste end in sea
the irresponsible dumping of polythene waste to the sea will soon lead to more plastic waste in the sea than fish said President Sri Lanka Institute of Packing (SLIP) Anuradha Jayasinghe at their Lanka star awards event last Tuesday.
He said that each year an estimated 8 million metric tons of plastic waste is dumped to the Sea. It is sad to note that 80% of this is been dumped by Asians according to a study made by German researchers. These researchers have also pointed out that only 1% of plastic waste is dumped to the sea by Europeans. Time has now come for Asians to be more responsible towards the environmental protection, he said.
Former President SLIP Razik Zarook, PC, who was the Chief Guest said the government and people should be more responsible towards waste disposal. When there was a major flood in India, some of the hospital waste was washed away to Sri Lankas Manner beach recently. This showed that the Indian hospital has not taken great care about the disposal of hospital waste in a safe manner.
Commenting on the present local packaging industry he said that it was not performing to expectations. This is because the Sri Lankas economy situation where the economic growth is around 3.5%. Due to this rural people dont have a high buying power which limits local production and intern results in less packaging assignments.But we see positives signs of the Sri Lankan economy recovering to reach around 6% growth where the industry too would recover.
He said what the industry must do now is to focus on exports to areas such as Africa where their economies are growing at over 6%.
Zarook also said that Sri Lanka should look at more trade pacts with other countries which in turn would open out new markets for Sri Lankan exporters. Going global is the right way forward.
He also advised to move with more new technology and identified Nano technology to be a good option. Today Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking over the world and Sri Lankan packaging industry too should adopt AI to survive, he said.
