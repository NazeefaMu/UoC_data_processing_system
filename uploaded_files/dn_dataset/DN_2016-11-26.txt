Mike Tyson Memories of a magnificent fighting machine 30 years on
Cue the theme from Jaws. Picture a fin, knifing through the foam on the horizon. Play dead or get ready to punch him on the nose Good luck with that. Mike Tyson arrived on the heavyweight scene like a great white beneath a crashing wave. Eyes that were dead but could drill right through you. And those teeth, straight out of Mack the Knife: When that shark bites scarlet billows start to spread. Next, a body was usually dumped on the canvas, oozing life.
Tyson was what the boxing world had been waiting for since the demise of Sonny Liston two decades earlier. Three years after Liston's death in 1970, the New York Times opined that heavyweight boxing missed his frightening sense of evil. American sports writer Bud Collins wrote: Sonny is an ogre I miss.
George Foreman - the early 1970s version who put holes in people, rather than the 1990s version who was like your grandad - briefly fitted the bill. But Muhammad Ali cast out the evil Foreman, just like he had cast out the evil Liston 10 years earlier. And when Ali belatedly hung them up, things got dull.
Ownership of the heavyweight crown
Larry Holmes was a former Ali sparring partner with some of his skills but little of his charisma. Between winning the world heavyweight crown in 1978 and losing it to Michael Spinks in 1985, Holmes forged a reputation as one of the most technically proficient champions in history and one of theleast inspiring.
While Holmes reigned, for the most part serenely, the promoter Don King - a man Holmes once described as hating fighters - took ownership of the heavyweight crown, as revealed by investigative journalist Jack Newfield in his book, The Life and Crimes of Don King.
After Michael Dokes, whom King had likened to a son, lost his WBA title to South Africa's Gerrie Coetzee in 1983, King stepped over his prone body to embrace the new champion. Dokes fell further into cocaine addiction and a few years later was reduced to begging King for money, apparently to no avail.
But the fight that best defines the era was between Tim Witherspoon and Greg Page in 1984. Despite the match being for the vacant WBC belt, Page was so demoralised by King's treatment that he barely trained. After Witherspoon was awarded a contentious decision, Holmes, who had vacated the title, commented that he had seen more action watching old ladies play the slot machines.
When Witherspoon returned to King's training camp, money was so scarce and the mood so low, the champion tried to start a revolt. Other fighters in the camp included former world champion Leon Spinks and future Tyson opponents Mitch Green, Pinklon Thomas and Trevor Berbick, also the last man to fight Ali. But there was so much weed being smoked, they couldn't get motivated. Witherspoon thought his world title defence against Frank Bruno would finally make him a millionaire. But after King had made the necessary deductions from his purse, Witherspoon was left with $90,000. Bruno, despite being the challenger and knocked out in the 11th round, walked away with $900,000.
When Witherspoon was knocked out in one round by James Smith in his next fight, he was simply relieved that King was out of his life. A couple of weeks later, he was served with an eviction notice after failing to pay rent.
As the heavyweight scene stagnated, boxing fans got their fixes from the lower weight divisions. The sport was kept alive by the Four Kings - Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Thomas Hearns and Roberto Duran - who staged a round-robin of thrilling fights that further highlighted the sad state the big boys were in. And then came Tyson, the heavyweight ogre everyone had been missing.
Tyson's defeat in the 1984 Olympic trials was broadcast live on television. He turned pro at the start of 1985, during which he racked up 15 victories, all by knockout, 11 of them in the first round. It was around about this time that the Jaws music kicked in, and the various alphabet champions began to get twitchy.
After a horrific childhood in some of the more unsavoury neighbourhoods of New York, Tyson was taken under the wing of venerable boxing trainer Cus D'Amato, who had guided Floyd Patterson to the world heavyweight title twice.
D'Amato must have seen plenty of Liston in his protege, because Liston, who knocked Patterson out twice in one round, was also a criminal since childhood.
Tyson's legal guardian
D'Amato became Tyson's legal guardian, attempted to keep him on the straight and narrow (while occasionally having to smooth things over with the police) and moulded him into a vicious fighting machine. And when D'Amato died in November 1985, Tyson carried on doing what he did best - making life ooze.
Tyson made his television debut as a pro in February 1986, against a decent prospect called Jesse Ferguson.
The 19-year-old had already appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated and before he entered the ring - minus the traditional robe and wearing short black shorts and no socks - the crowd was in raptures.
In a ring that resembled a phone box, Tyson tenderised Ferguson like a lump of meat. After a sixth-round stoppage, Tyson described the uppercut that had floored Ferguson in the fifth: I tried to catch him on the tip of the nose, because I tried to punch the bone into his brain. I didn't want him to last.
While Liston's frightening sense of evil was too pungent for many in the more innocent early 60s, contemporary boxing fans couldn't get enough of Tyson. A 5ft 11in, 220lb, bull-necked slab of badness who kept pigeons.
Quite wonderful
Remarkably, at least by today's standards, Tyson had fought 12 times in 1986 before landing a shot at Berbick's WBC title in Las Vegas. The fight was part of an elimination tournament, designed to unify the three main world title belts, and Berbick sounded confident of victory: I'm going to take him to school. I'm very relaxed. This is the best thing that's ever happened to me.
It didn't look like Tyson was learning much, as he wailed away on Berbick with crosses and hooks. Berbick didn't look relaxed when a Tyson right hand sent him crashing to the canvas. And it didn't look like the best thing to have happened to Berbick, as he collapsed onto some ringside photographers before attempting to get to his feet, staggering sideways and hitting thedeck again.
Now the whole world knew it: Tyson was so mean, he could knock you down twice with one punch. And he could punch you drunk in under six minutes. And the kid was only 20, the youngest world heavyweight champion in history..
Writers anointed him the rightful heir to Jackson, Dempsey, Louis and Ali, but D'Amato's fighting machine was already malfunctioning. Ever wondered why Tyson looked so angry that night It might be because he was shot through with a dose of gonorrhoea that stung far more than anything Berbick threw at him.
The following July, Tyson outpointed Tony Tucker to become the first undisputed world heavyweight champion since 1978. In 1988, he stopped Holmes in four rounds, before disposing of Michael Spinks, another former champion, in one. Bruno followed in 1989, before it all came crashing down.
The Tyson that entered the ring against James Buster Douglas in February 1990 was pitifully diminished by personal turmoil, his marriage having burnt out spectacularly in public and King having finally sunk his claws into him. The sight of Tyson, scrabbling for his gumshield on his hands and knees as the referee counts him out is as pathetic in the memory as it was shocking at the time. There followed a prison sentence for rape, the regaining of the world title, the night he lost it again, the night he bit off an ear, the loss of his fortune (likely to happen if you swap pigeons for Bengal tigers) and more sad nights in the ring.
But nothing that has happened since can erase the memory of what a magnificent fighting machine he was, way back when: coming at you like a great white shark, spreading scarlet billows, dumping bodies, oozing life.  BBC

Ivory Coast's penniless children try golf, game of the rich
YAMOUSSOUKRO, Ivory Coast - Plucked out of poverty, 1,000 children in IvoryCoast are being given a unique chance to learn golf, and 10-year-old Jessica likes the idea.
I love golf and my dream is to become an international golfer and work for the World Bank, says the girl, who comes from the poor and often dangerous Dioulabougou district of Yamoussoukro, the country's administrative capital..
Wearing a t-shirt and black leggings, Jessica is one of 120 children in the first wave of new golfers to Le President Golf Club, which is normally reserved for Ivory Coast's elite and wealthy.
The visit is part of a Golf for All project which saw the STL golf academy travelling across Korhogo, one of Ivory Coast's poorest regions, and around Yamassoukro's most deprived districts and orphanages looking for potential players.
The sons and daughters of peasants, farm and factory workers were wide-eyed when they took to the 18-hole course that was built by late president Felix Houphouet-Boigny as part of his campaign to turn his home village into an international city.
Designed by former Welsh professional Dave Thomas, the course is spread over 90 hectares (225 acres) of resplendent, lush land with century-old trees lining the fairways.
The aim is to get them out of poverty through golf and give a chance to all children in Ivory Coast, no matter what their social level, says Jean-Claude N'Da, a golf instructor who works on the project.
A key partner is golf coach Henrik Lundqvist, who spent four months travelling across Sweden to collect 20 tonnes of equipment to donate to the project, and who believes that teaching children is the best way to introduce the sport to Africa.
We are going to train up young Ivorians so they can make golf popular, says the Swedish golfer. AFP

We shine the ball the same way: Smith
South Africa captain Faf du Plessis doesnt expect to be sledged over theball-tampering controversy during the ongoing third Test in Adelaide -because the Australians shine the cricket ball the same way.
But former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting says du Plessis is lucky to escape the saga without a ban for a clear breach of International Cricket Council regulations.
The Proteas skipper was fined his entire match fee by the ICC after he was found guilty of ball tampering during the Hobart Test, but avoided being banned for the third match of the series.
On Thursday, du Plessis again pleaded his innocence and said the ruling opens up a can of worms.
And he doesnt believe the Australians will use the scandal against him during the Adelaide Test because shining the ball is part of the game.
The Aussies wont talk about it at all because they know its part of their team as well, du Plessis told reporters.
(The controversy) has not been driven by the (Australian) cricketers at all. Theres been no comment whatsoever from them, in fact its all been positive comments.
I even read a comment from Darren Lehmann supporting and backing me, which was really good to see.
Australia Test captain Steve Smith didnt reject du Plessis comments and said his side shines the ball the same way.
Every team around the world shines the cricket ball, Smith said. I have seen Fafs comments in his press conference. And I make it veryclear that we havent come out and said anything about Faf or about how he was shining the ball or anything like that.
We along with every other team around the world shine the ball the same way.
Ponting, however, said Du Plessis was lucky to be cleared to play the match in Adelaide.
Ive been a little bit disappointed with the way theyve acted, to tell you the truth, the former Aussie skipper said in Melbourne.
As has been shown, hes been proven guilty. Theyve made out that it was all a storm in a teacup when hes actually broken an ICC (rule).
Hes got a 100 per cent match fee (fine)  he was probably lucky not to get a game (suspension). Its not the first time hes done it, either. But the game goes on.
These things happen in the game all the time and you move on. - CA

Du Plessis scandal a storm in a lolly bag
At the outset, I want to dismiss all the fuss around sweets, saliva andshining a cricket ball as a storm in a lolly bag.
Im happy to admit that I am no academic expert on the impact that sugar can have on the aerodynamics of fast bowling but Ive played and coached enough cricket to know that the whole thing is a bit ridiculous.
When I was playing, we used to dig into the lolly snakes to keep energy up during a long bowling stint and Im sure at some stages I would have shined the ball shortly after eating one (or three) without a second thought. And to my knowledge, when I was coaching at Yorkshire there was no specific sweets kept in our dressing room that were earmarked for ball shining.
In county cricket you hear all sorts of theories, but from my experience the players that do the best are the consistent performers  the blokes who can bowl a disciplined line and length for as long as possible, and the batsmen who are patient and stick to their process.
They are the ones who find success, not the ones who have a lot of theories on whats the best way of shining a cricket ball with a sweet in their mouth.
What did strike me as impressive during that whole saga, which has been driven by the ICC and has nothing to do with the Australian team making any accusations or complaints, was the solidarity the South Africans showed for their captain Faf du Plessis.
They obviously think its a load of garbage and have stood firm, as a team and in support of their skipper.
The other point thats got lost in that debate and the radical shake-up of Australias Test and selection personnel is just how well the South Africans have played, especially their pace attack.
Australia have been poor in certain areas, but some of the bowling has been as good as Ive seen in the past decade of Test cricket. Where they have excelled is what I often referred to as ruthless simplicity  keeping it simple and hammering the process. I know the Yorkshire boys used to get sick of me saying process, process, process, but its really important because you dont want to be thinking of the end result.
The outcome will arrive if you nail the process really well, and I think thats where Australia have fallen down at times in this series.
As a bowler, what has an even bigger impact than sugary saliva when youve got ball in hand is knowing your teams scored big runs and youve got plenty in the bank.
But when youve bowled your heart out and then batted poorly, suddenly youre out there bowling again and that can be very dispiriting andde-motivating. People say you should put the scoreboard out of your mind in that situation, but you wonder if a bit of that gets into the psyche of the bowlers.
Then what they try to do is take a wicket every ball and bowl the magic delivery, as opposed to sticking to the process of that disciplined line and length, and building the pressure, and the knowledge that wickets will come.
The pressure is in them to make an impact and they can try too hard, and when youre trying things youre looking beyond what needs to be done to get the outcomes youre after.
Of course, selection is different and when the teams is performing as poorly as Australia have of late you have to try new thinking, and new players. So I like the decisions theyve made to totally revamp the squad for the Adelaide Test and can see the rationale behind those huge changes, even if some of them are a bit unconventional.

## Title: Al Ain banking on Brazilian Amoory

Al Ain banking on Brazilian Amoory
DUBAI: Al Ain will look to star playmaker Omar Abdulrahman as they bid to snatch victory from Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors in the second leg of the AFC Champions League final on Saturday.
Top-rated Abdulrahman, known as Amoory will be a key man as the Emiratis strive to overcome a 2-1 deficit against South Koreas Jeonbuk at their home stadium in UAE.
Brazilian hitman Leonardo hit a sizzling second-half double to give Jeonbuk the edge in last weeks first leg, after Abdulrahman brilliantly set up Al Ains opener.
Leonardo said shaggy-haired Abdulrahman, who has drawn interest from Manchester City, Barcelona and Arsenal, played with all the freedom of a Brazilian -- but warned he wasnt Al Ains only dangerman.
Omar Abdulrahman is like a Brazilian, an incredible player with great quality, said the Jeonbuk forward, according to the Asian Football Confederation website.
Hes performed with distinction for Al Ain and for his national team, and the fact that there are many big clubs after him is evidence enough of his ability.
But we have to focus not only on him, Al Ain have other dangerous players who we must prepare for. As a team, I dont believe they are very different from us in terms of the set-up and playing style, we just have to be careful. Expectations are high for Abdulrahman, who will try to help Al Ain win their second Asian title and, next week, is favourite to be named Asias player of the year at an awards show in Abu Dhabi.
Beautiful football
Abdulrahman was anonymous in last weeks first half in Jeonju but he came alive after the break, forcing a fine save before he held off three defenders to set up Danilo Asprillas opener.
It looked to have turned the game but Leonardo equalised with a rocket from outside the box before he calmly converted a penalty to put Jeonbuk in the driving seat.
Colombias Asprilla warned the final wasnt over yet and said Al Ain still expected to be crowned Asias club champions in front of their home fans.
On our own pitch, at home, we can play our game -- our beautiful football -- and we have confidence we can get the result we want, he said.
I believe in myself and my team-mates that we can get the win at home and can lift the AFC Champions League title. However, Jeonbuks attacking trident of Leonardo, Kim Shin-Wook and Ricardo Lopes remain a real threat and Al Ain will do well to keep them quiet for 90 minutes.
Leonardos double put him on 10 goals for the competition, a hat-trick away from equalling the all-time record of 13 shared by Guangzhou Evergrandes Muriqui and Adriano of FC Seoul.
We have to play intelligently in Saturdays game and we have to work hard and work together to ensure we can secure the victory we need, Leonardo said.
The AFC Champions League is everything weve worked towards this year, not just this year, but ever since losing the 2011 final.
Now that we have this opportunity we have to give our lives to win this game. It means a lot to me and to everyone involved in the club.
Jeonbuk won the Asian title in 2006 and reached the final again in 2011, where they lost out to Qatars Al Sadd on penalties. - AFP

## Title: Rio Olympic golf course eerily empty three months on

Rio Olympic golf course eerily empty three months on
RIO AFP JANEIRO: Just three months after the Olympics ended, Rios beautiful but controversial golf course is eerily quiet with the squawks of birds far louder than the whack of balls.
Built specially for the Olympics on what had been a nature reserve next to the beach in western Rio, the links-style course was meant to convert Brazilians to a sport they barely know and put Rio on the international golfing map.
Instead, the $19 million facility created by star US designer Gil Hanse risks turning into a white elephant. A payment dispute could even lead to the imminent exit of the company responsible for upkeep, raising questions over the courses survival.
During a visit by AFP this week, just three people were hitting balls at the driving range. The main course was closed for maintenance but even when open 20 people would be considered a good crowd, with numbers rising a little on weekends, employees said.
The clubhouse was not only empty but almost entirely unfurnished.
In the cafe, which has no chairs, a solitary waiter and a second man there to collect greens fees waited in silence for customers.
A course that merely weeks ago hosted some of the worlds best golfers has no pro-shop or a pro. There is no website. Even getting there can be tricky: there are no road signs indicating the entrance.
Perhaps encouraged by the lack of human activity, the Olympic courses wild inhabitants seem happy.
Birds and butterflies flit through the rough. A capybara -- a squat, heavy-set rodent that grows to the size of a dog -- waddles next to one of the water hazards.
And when a big caiman -- a cousin of the alligator -- surfaces from the pond, the impression of a land that time forgot seems complete.
Pulling out
Rio de Janeiros two other golf courses are not up to international standards and belong to exclusive private clubs. The Olympic course, run by the Brazilian Golf Confederation, is public.
But few Brazilians play the game and the greens fees are high enough to put many off: $74-$82 per person for residents, and $192 for foreigner visitors.
With so few locals playing and no obvious plan for attracting foreigners, funding is already a problem.
Neil Cleverly, the Briton who built the course and now manages the upkeep, says the company he works for, Progolf, has not been paid for two months.
What happens when we run out of gas or diesel Weve been close, Cleverly said. None of us know if therell be a job for us in December. A source close to the company who asked not to be identified said Progolf has been given no contract by the confederation and, having been forced to foot the $82,000 monthly maintenance operation out of its own pocket, is set to pull out.
Maybe next month, the source said.
If that happens, the confederation would quickly have to find expert replacements before damage set in.
Without maintenance, the golf course will die, the source said. It could take four weeks, three weeks. Repeated requests from AFP for reaction from the confederation were not answered.
Frustration
Cleverly, who describes the Rio project as the most challenging of his globe-trotting career, shakes his head at the mess.
Its so frustrating for us to get as far as we did. A lot of people said youre never going to do it, he said, recalling the challenge of building in Brazil.
So yes, Im disappointed and its mixed up with a lot of frustration. There was also dismay among the handful of Brazilian retirees whod come to practice. They praised the course while wondering how long it can last.
The course is spectacular, Roberto Maueler, 61, said, but people are really worried. We have a movement of golfers trying to pressure the authorities and the confederation to keep the course going, he said. Luiz Villaboim, 64, called the course fascinating. Weve seen owls here. There are capybaras and caimans, he said as he worked on his swing. But the absence of more basic features puzzles him.
It seems that nothing has been done for the course since the Olympics.

Kandy SC to manacle Cops in the hills
Kandy SC who will host Police SC at Nittawela today are determined to manacle the cops and give continuity to their winning streak treating the defeat to Air Force as a bad dream. The encounter is a first round rugby game of the 2016/17 Rugby league. This season Kandy SC who has two wins in three outings posted the biggest scoreline 96. They will go out attempting to better that score. The defending champions will throw everything into the first half of the battle in an effort to make a big score. A big win on their home ground is essential. Todays match will be played under the patronage of the Chief Minister of Central Province Sarath Ekanayake. Kandy SC scrum-half and Captain Roshan Weeraratne believes that statistics is about to change in this game and is quietly confident. He will have a huge responsibility on his shoulders and will be expected to bring out the best in their outside backs with their playmaking abilities. Kandy SC is not playing like defending cup winners at the moment. Their performance in all departments of the game is surprisingly ordinary. It looks like the whole team is depending on a few players while others are playing like passengers. This is not the way to play the game. Police meanwhile, failed to record a single win in all three games they played. The Policemen are seeking to field their strongest possible lineup. They have struggled to move the ball quickly enough in recent times and if they are to succeed that will hinge on how they are going to fare. Police have lost all their games in a year they are celebrating 150 years. Skipper Udara Suriyapereuma is blessed with a side with good knowledgeable players, very physical; they should have a game plan and also correct their weak areas. Winning will be hard for them, but they are capable of proving worthy opponents.

Havies swamp CH 48/5
Havelocks Sports Club went on the rampage, when they ran circles against the luckless CH and FC outfit scoring a massive 48 points (8 tries, 4 conversions) to 5 (1 try) victory in their first round Dialog A Division inter-club league rugby match played at Havelock Park yesterday.
The winners led 31-5 at lemons.
The entire Havies team got their act together from the word go by scoring a total of eight superb tries, five in the first half and three in the second for which the sorry CH side had no answers.
They were a really lost unit throughout the entire game.
For the winning Havelocks side the tries were scored by hooker Prasath Madusanka (two), full back Dulaj Perera (two), scrum half Vimukthi Rahula (two), prop forward Liston Flatney (one) and flanker Shenal Deelaka (one). Dulaj Perera slotted in four conversions.

Khawaja props up Australia
ADELAIDE Friday: Iron-willed Usman Khawaja batted out the entire day to tilt the third day-night Test towards Australia with a masterful century against South Africa on Friday.
At the close on the second day in Adelaide, the Australians were 307 for six in reply to the Proteas 259 for nine declared, with Khawaja unbeaten on 138 off 285 balls and Mitchell Starc not out 16. The home side lead by 48 runs. It was Khawajas fifth Test century and arguably his best as Australia seek to prevent the Proteas from an unprecedented series clean sweep after huge defeats in the opening two Tests.
Khawaja, who has performed best out of the Australian batsmen in a troubled series, led the way with his wristy shot-making to put the home side in front in the pink-ball Test. It was the first century by an Australian in the series and the stylish left-hander has now scored 307 runs in the three Tests.
Credit to Usman to bat an entire day against a world-class attack, said team-mate Peter Handscomb, who scored a half-century on debut batting with Khawaja.
He was very collected, very calculated and he never looked flustered ... it was awesome to watch him from the other end. But Khawajas well-crafted ton was marred by a mix-up which left skipper Steve Smith stranded as he darted off for a quick single.
Smith, who was put down by Hashim Amla on 46, was sailing along when his run out for 59 came out of the blue in a bad breakdown in communication with Khawaja.
After Smith called for a quick single off left-arm spinner Tabraiz Shamsi, Khawaja took several tentative steps before wheeling back and Smith was caught well out of his ground by Vernon Philanders throw to wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock.
Smith put on 137 for the third wicket in his 158 minutes at the crease and his dismissal summoned Handscomb to the wicket.
Khawaja and Handscomb strengthened Australias grip before Kyle Abbott got one through the debutants defences on 54.
Handscomb looked comfortable in his 78-ball stay, hitting six fours, including three successive boundaries off Philander to reach his maiden Test half-century.
But another debutant Nic Maddinson struggled with a 12-ball duck, bowled middle stump by a Kagiso Rabada inswinger.
The South African bowlers laboured to make a breakthrough for the first time in the series as Australias batsmen finally put up a resistance after several humiliating batting collapses.
Skipper Faf du Plessis used a total of seven bowlers in a bid to stop the Australian momentum, before taking the second new ball.
Recalled wicketkeeper Matthew Wade lasted just six balls for four, but Starc stayed at the crease with Khawaja in the days final overs.
The Proteas struck twice with the wickets of English-born newcomer Matt Renshaw and David Warner inside the first hour. AFP

Pakistan strike twice before rain halts Test
HAMILTON: New Zealand reached 77-2 against Pakistan before rain forced day one of the second and final Test to be abandoned after just 21 overs in Hamilton on Friday. The players took lunch 15 minutes early as the skies opened, with Jeet Raval on 35 and Ross Taylor on 29 after the early loss of Tom Latham and Kane Williamson.
Three hours later, the umpires tired of waiting for the rain to clear and scratched the final session. Play will resume half-an-hour early at 10:30 am on Saturday (2130 GMT Friday).
Pakistan won the toss in bowler-friendly conditions with a green wicket and heavy cloud cover, but apart from Mohammad Amir, their seamers were unable to pin New Zealand down. AFP
