Accountability is sine qua non in confidence building
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's speech in Parliament last Tuesday came at a crucial juncture of Sri Lanka's contemporary political history. It was made in the immediate aftermath of the release of OHCHR Investigation report on Sri Lanka and days before the US sponsored consensus resolution at the UNHRC in Geneva. It also preceded the visit of President Maithripala Sirisena to New York to attend the UN General Assembly.
In this speech, Wickremesinghe outlined the President's and his Government's work plan for durable peace and reconciliation in the country. He vowed to bring about a permanent political solution to the national question, expressing his determination not to pass on the festering wounds of the past to the future generation.
The efforts to find a long-lasting political solution are nothing new as many leaders over the past decades had emphasised on the same, but had ultimately done little to make it happen. One reason may be because the political decisions required for such a move are neither popular nor easy. The tenor of Premier's speech indicated that he was fully aware of the high-stakes it involves, but at the same time was ready to take even the harder decisions it takes to put an end to the ethnic tensions that spring up from time to time in the post-independence Sri Lanka.
"We are not ready to repeat the same mistakes of the past. The solutions to these problems cannot be reached by inciting communalism. We hope to discuss with all parties concerned and arrive at a consensus to solve this issue. This is the best gift that we can think of for our future generation", he noted.
Wickremesinghe also stressed that his Government adheres to a firm policy of always doing the "correct thing for all communities". Explaining in detail on the domestic mechanism to be set up for truth seeking, justice, reparation, and to avoid recurrence of the past tedious experiences, he underscored that "the accountability" is a sine qua non in trust building among communities and restoring the rule of law.
The Premier's words reflected his statesmanship. He spoke for the common good of all, and not to win votes. The famous quote by American theologian and author James Freeman Clarke, "The difference between a politician and a statesman is that a politician thinks about the next election while the statesman thinks about the next generation," could have provided an appropriate prelude for Wickremesinghe's speech.
This speech stood in contrast to ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa's victorious speech in Parliament on May 19, 2009, where he poured out supra-patriot emotion with remarks such as "I value my motherland first, second and third", and that there were no minorities in the country and the only two groups left behind were the ones who love the country and those who have no love for the land of their birth. However, the next six years that followed proved that he was not true to his words and that it needs much more than the chest thumping emotion to deal with the sensitive issues of the country.
Even though a National Unity Government was formed to collectively resolve the long-lingering questions of the country, doubts remain whether it will serve the expectations of building a consensual Parliament. The conduct of Parliament on Wednesday was a strong indication that troubles are far from over.
Opposition walked out of Parliament
A group of about 35 UPFA MPs in the Opposition walked out of Parliament in protest of moving several financial Resolutions for debate, stating they have got no sufficient time to study them. They argued the Government's move contravened the Standing Orders and Parliamentary traditions.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena vehemently opposing the debate demanded to either suspend the sittings to convene a Party Leaders' Meeting to discuss the matter or move the Resolutions for a vote. Dr. Sarath Amunugama also insisted at least two weeks time should be given to study them as those were related to finances of the country, adding that many new MPs were quite eager to contribute for the debate. The Speaker suspending the sittings convened a meeting of the Committee of Parliamentary Business to discuss the matter. Making an announcement when the House resumed, the Speaker stated that he was of the opinion that the MPs must be given adequate time to prepare for the debates in the House, but informed that it was agreed at the meeting to commence the debate without wasting time and adjourn it for October 6 and put to vote on that day.
The reasons for the objections of the UPFA MPs made little sense as the Resolutions were related to the expenditures already made in 2014 and were proposed in the Budget 2013. In other words, those referred to the spending done when they were in the ruling party. They were reluctant to speak on their own Government's financial handling and chose to run away from the debate.
This group was headed by MPs Dinesh Gunawardena, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Kumara Welgama, Ranjith de Zoysa, Namal Rajapaksa, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Rohitha Abeygunawardena, and Bandula Gunawardena etc.
It was apparent that the ulterior motive of this incorrigible, self-serving and power hungry group was none other than to disrupt the business of Parliament and put up a media show. Interestingly, all of them were staunch supporters of ex-President Rajapaksa. They caused similar distractions, some say under shadow orders, even during the period of previous interim Government becoming the biggest noise-makers in Parliament.
Several new comers have also joined with this group including MPs Udaya Gammanpila, Prasanna Ranatunga, Geetha Kumarasinghe, Sisira Jayakody, Jayantha Samaraweera and Niroshan Premaratne. Most of them were from minor coalition parties in the UPFA. After walking out of Parliament, they staged a protest near the main road that leads to the Parliament complex, while also giving voice cut to media.
When Parliament turned to pandemonium with the clamour of Opposition MPs, the Prime Minister also lost his cool on several occasions. Expressing his displeasure over the disorderly conduct of MPs, he stated the debate would not be held if the Opposition does not want it.
"When we were in the Opposition, we asked for debates but the Government refused. Now that we are in the Government, we are ready to give them a debate, but they say 'no'. What we have today is an autocratic Opposition and a democratic Government," he observed.
Amidst this heat, the Premier also affronted Vasudeva Nanayakkara by calling him "Vattakka Gediya" (pumpkin) and Chandrasiri Gajadeera by calling him "Kottoruwa" (wood pecker).
Wickremesinghe and Nanayakkara clashed head on once again reminding the audience of the previous episode of their fall out four months ago which ended up in unparliamentary language. This time it all began with the firm objection of Nanayakkara over the Speaker's decision to allow the Government to move the Financial Resolutions for debate. "I am totally against your decision. I walk out of the House to show my objection," he shouted.
However, as some UPFA MPs asked him to stay calm, Nanayakkara once again took his seat. At this point the Premier making a hard hitting remark said, if Nanayakkara remains in the Chamber he must apologize to the Speaker, and if not he must leave immediately.
UPFA Opposition group
With this remark, the UPFA Opposition group started shouting at Wickremesinghe causing confusion in Parliament. However, the Speaker proceeded to commence the debate and the UPFA MPs in the Opposition walked out in protest. Watching them leaving, Wickremesinghe noted, "Parliament is here to conduct debates. If they do not accept the January 8 revolution, there is nothing that we can do for that. I call this move of the Opposition as a beggars' revolution, because those who entered Parliament by begging the votes of SLFP are now trying to rebel".
Interestingly, MPs Lakshman Seneviratne and Dr. Sarath Amunugama remained in their seats in the Opposition benches. Some in the audience were asking whether these two will also take oaths in some ministerial position in the near future.
Meanwhile, Parliament on Tuesday approved the names of Dr. Ahangamage Tudor Ariyaratne, Shibly Aziz and Dr. Radhika Coomaraswamy as civil society representatives to the Constitutional Council (CC). With these appointments, the ten members of the CC are now complete.
The Resolution to this effect was presented by Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella on behalf of the Prime Minister. Receiving Parliament nod to these appointments, which had been postponed several times during the interim Government period, was an important step forward in ensuring effective and independent functioning of important organs of the country including the public service, judiciary and police. This body is responsible to oversee the appointment of members for the 11 Independent Commissions proposed in the 19th Amendment, and key positions of the country such as the IGP, Attorney General, Auditor General, Chief Justice, Supreme Court Judges etc. The other seven members in the CC include Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, Ministers Patali Champika Ranawaka, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, W. D. J. Seneviratne and JVP MP Vijitha Herath. Yet again, MP Dinesh Gunawardena objected to the appointment of Ministers to the Constitutional Council (CC), stating that there was an agreement not to appoint Ministers to the CC after the elections. However his objection did not gather momentum and Speaker proceeded with his usual official duties without much hindrance.

Australia's oldest cricketer dies, aged 100
Australia's oldest first-class cricketer, former NSW player Harold Stapleton, has died aged 100.
Stapleton, an allrounder who played one first-class match for NSW in 1941 before his career was cut short by the Second World War, celebrated his 100th birthday during the Sydney Test against India in January. Stapleton marked the occasion with friends and family in Wollongong while the milestone was acknowledged on the scoreboard at the SCG, a match Stapleton watched on television with his nephew Kevin.

Child Ordinance to be formulated
A Child Ordinance would be formulated in Sri Lanka to provide guidelines on handling incidents involving children, said Women and Children's Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara.
She said that it would provide guidelines as to how the authorities would act on incidents such as the arrest of the school boy in connection with the Seya Sadewmi murder.
The minister also said the Police and the media had to act responsibly when publishing and reporting on stories on the arrest of the school boy.
She stated that although the boy's innocence was proved with the arrest of the suspect in connection with the Seya murder, the boy's image and self respect have been tarnished.
Minister Bandara said as persons below the age of 18 years are considered to be children, the Police and media are duty bound not to reveal the whereabouts of the youth who are arrested as crime suspects.
She said even their photographs should not be published or exposed to society by the media or Police.
"The Ministry will take steps to formulate the Child Ordinance, and two officials have been assigned to monitor the investigations being conducted into the Seya Sadewmi murder.

Kelani river pollution
Coca Cola pays Rs 132 m as compensation
The Coca Cola Company has paid approximately Rs 132 million to three government bodies as compensation for polluting the Kelani river.
The company paid Rs 131 million to the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWS&DB), Rs 1.5 million to the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) and Rs 177,000 to the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA).
An NWS&DB official confirmed the receipt of a cheque amounting to Rs 131 million from the Company as compensation for damages from oil contamination to the Kelani river, the main source of drinking water for the Colombo District, on August 17.
She said the incident caused heavy damage to the Ambatale Treatment Plant, adding that the repairs to it would be carried out from the compensation received.
CEA Chairman Prof. Lal Mervin Dharmasiri said it has received Rs 1.5 million to recover its expenses incurred for research and other activities carried out following the incident.
He noted the Environmental Protection License (EPL) issued to the Companys bottling Plant at Biyagama was temporarily suspended following the incident, but, it was conditionally restored subject to implementation of the recommendations made by them.
Accordingly, the manufacturing operations at the plant were resumed on September 1. MEPA Chairman Ranjith Meegaswatte noted the company had been paid Rs 177,000 to recover its expenses to clean the water body after the leakage of diesel from a fuel pipe line of the company.
Heavy public protest was directed toward the Coca Cola Company following the oil contamination incident which inconvenienced the consumers of water in the metropolitan city. Water supply to the Colombo, Dehiwela, Mount Lavinia and Kotte Municipal Council areas were restricted on August 17 and 28 due to oil contamination in the Kelani River.
In a press statement following the issue, the Coca-Cola Company reaffirmed its commitment to the country and the consumers, and regretted the accident while assuring to take measures to prevent such an occurrence in the future.

Greatest World Cup upsets of all time
As Japan produce what could be the biggest upset of the World Cup 2015 by defeating South Africa 34-23 in Brighton. We take a look at other huge shocks.
South Africa 32 Japan 34: 2015 group stage
It should have been a colossal mismatch: Japan who have won only one match in the finals, over Zimbabwe in Belfast in 1991, against double champions and aristocrats of the game, South Africa. And yet from the start Japan kept trading blows with their taller, far heavier opponents.
The Springboks, disjointed and ponderous, used their power and experience to fight back after half-time, but Japan never said die and kept discomfiting South Africa with their pace and verve, and through the boot of Ayumu Goromaru. The full-back capped his performance with a marvellous try made by Kotaro Matsushima's clever run to level the game at 29-29 but when South Africa took a late lead with a penalty of their own, the natural order seemed to have been restored.
But no one counted on Japan's guts, ambition and patience.
They worked their way diligently up the field in an 18-phase move, won a penalty that would have allowed them to equalise and leave with an honourable draw. Twice they turned down the opportunity and with 35 seconds to go opted for, of all things, not a line-out but a 5m scrum which they eventually won after a couple of resets.
South Africa overcommitted in defence and Leitch saw his chance, beginning a rapid chain of passes that ended with the replacement Karne Hesketh storming in from 15m on the opposite flank. History was made.
Australia 21 Wales 22: 1987 third-place play-off
Australia had already suffered an upset in their semi-final defeat to France - widely regarded as the game of the tournament. What followed though was possibly an even greater shock. How much the pre-tournament favourites were motivated for a bronze-medal match is debatable but they certainly should have beaten a Wales side who shipped 49 points in their own semi against New Zealand.
The game was incredibly tight throughout, each side touching down twice before Adrian Hadley's last-gasp try and Paul Thorburn's remarkable conversion from a tight angle settled it.
Western Samoa 16 Wales 13: 1991 group stage
"Thank heavens Wales weren't playing the whole of Samoa," went the famous quip following arguably the greatest shock in World Cup history. Wales's Cardiff Arms Park defeat to Western Samoa was the first time a leading rugby nation had come unstuck in the tournament against a rank outsider. It sent shock waves through the principality as 1987's third-placed team ultimately failed to get out of their group. In fairness, Samoa possessed arguably their most talented ever line-up and simply outmuscled their smaller opponents.
Both sides scored two tries but it was the more reliable kicking of Mathew Vaea that proved decisive.
Ireland 15 Australia 6: 2011 group stage
Ireland defied all expectations by summoning a performance of controlled ferocity to stun Australia last month and place one foot in the World Cup quarter-finals.
The Irish stormed to the summit of Pool C by winning the group's pivotal match against the Tri-Nations champions and tournament second favourites at Eden Park. Jonathan Sexton kicked two penalties and a drop goal while Ronan O'Gara weighed in with six points in Ireland's finest World Cup display.
France 12 Argentina 17: 2007 group stage
A full 17 years after defending champions Argentina had lost the opening match of the soccer World Cup in a shock defeat by Cameroon, the rugby side pulled off a similar trick against hosts France.
Les Bleus, under huge pressure as the top-rated team in the northern hemisphere, seemed to freeze in the spotlight as Argentina's formidable forwards steamrollered through the French lines. Ignacio Corleto scored the game's only try as 80,000 French fans were stunned into silence.
Ireland 24 Argentina 28: 1999 quarter-final play-offs
Ireland were just beginning to re-establish themselves as a top-quality international side when their world came crashing down against unfancied Argentina in the 1999 tournament. What was not known then is that the Argentinians were on their own journey to rugby's top table. The match itself was dominated by the boot, with David Humphreys trading penalties with fellow fly-half Gonzalo Quesada, the tournament's top scorer. The contest was ultimately settled by winger Diego Albanese, who powered into the corner six minutes from time.
Wales 34 Fiji 38: 2007 group stage
Wales were sent crashing out of the World Cup by Fiji in an extraordinary encounter at the Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes. Fiji had stormed into a 25-3 lead with three tries in the space of 12 first-half minutes, from Gloucester's Akapusi Qera, winger Vilimoni Delasau and lock Kele Leawere.
After Alix Popham touched down for a pushover try shortly before the interval, Wales produced a spirited comeback to edge ahead with further scores from Shane Williams, Gareth Thomas and Mark Jones. Wales appeared to have the match won when Martyn Williams picked off a pass from Nicky Little and raced clear to score. But Fiji refused to be beaten and a try from Semisi Naevo four minutes from time sealed the islanders a quarter-final tie against South Africa - and cost Wales coach Gareth Jenkins his job the following day.
Wales 31 Samoa 38: 1999 group stage
The commentator who speculated on what the outcome would be were Wales to play the whole of Samoa only had to wait until their next World Cup meeting to find out. Proving lightning really can strike twice, the islanders repeated their shock victory from eight years earlier, becoming the first visiting team to win at Wales' shining new Millennium Stadium. However, unlike the 1991 game, the match was a feast of running rugby, the visitors clinical in the extreme in scoring five tries. The match is also memorable for Wales fly-half Neil Jenkins overtaking Michael Lynagh as Test rugby's highest ever points scorer.
South Africa 15 New Zealand 12: 1995 final
Notwithstanding their subsequent collapses to France and Australia in the following two World Cups, it is this result that first obliterated New Zealand's aura of invincibility. The All Blacks have been favourites for every World Cup since 1991 but never more so than when a Jonah Lomu-inspired XV blazed a trail all the way to the 1995 final against hosts South Africa.
The 18st wing had demolished England with a four-try blitz in the semi-final and was believed to be almost unplayable. But South Africa had other ideas and, inspired by a 62,000 partisan home crowd, completely shut down the All Blacks machine to win courtesy of a Joel Stransky drop goal in extra time.

Largest container vessel arrives at Colombo Port
Minister of Ports and Shipping Arjuna Ranathunga yesterday emphasised that the Government would develop the ports in the island to place Sri Lanka as one of the top container hubs in Asia.
He said so welcoming 'Marco Polo,' the first largest container vessel to the Colombo Port yesterday.
The minister said the government would further develop infrastructure facilities in the Colombo Port to achieve the set targets.
The 'Edith Maersk' was the largest container vessel that arrived in Sri Lanka before Marco Polo. It had 15,550 containers of cargo carrying capacity, while the Marco Polo has 16,020 containers of cargo carrying capacity. The Marco Polo is a UK registered vessel which was the world's largest vessel in 2012 and it was also the one and only UK flag containership.
The vessel is 396 meters in length and 29.9 meters in height. The Marko Polo was launched on November 7, 2012.
Speaking to the foreign media, Minister Ranathunga said the Government would hold 51% from future investment projects to be received to develop the Colombo Harbour for the country's benefit.
"Sri Lanka has now turned out to be a crucial center for shipping routes between China and Europe. Hence, we hope to develop our harbours to place Sri Lanka as an Asian container hub.
Currently, we are re-exporting vehicles to the Hambantota harbour. During the last political era, investors were reluctant to invest in the country due to the unfavourable socio political situation in the country. However, significant development had been achieved in port industry within last six months.
Now we should focus on increasing the potential of the Port Authority. We would be able to bring in a huge income to the country by developing the East Terminal at the Colombo Port," the Minister further asserted.
The Minister also visited the vessel before its departure tonight, a Ports and Shipping ministry release said.

Buses sans route permits on Northern line
Legal action against 90 owners
Legal action will be taken against owners of 90 buses operating between Colombo and Jaffna route and short distance routes within the Northern Province without route permits.
Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva instructed National Transport Commission (NTC) officers, the IGP and Police Chiefs in Vavuniya to inspect the buses and initiate legal action with immediate effect.
The minister made these remarks while visiting the construction site of a new bus terminal being built by the NTC at a cost of Rs. 200 million in Vavuniya.
De Silva said the Rs. 10,000 fine imposed on a bus plying without a route permit was not adequate.
"The fine should be increased to Rs. 100,000. The Amendment Bill in this connection will be presented to Parliament," the minister said.
He requested officials to inspect all buses using Vavuniya as the base.
It has been found that these buses belonging to politicians, public officers and wives of senior public officers operate on temporary route permits, the minister said.
The new bus terminal which has the state-of-the art facilities, can accommodate 34 buses at once and also provide facilities for the operation of around 100 buses plying between Jaffna and Colombo daily.

NCPA puts forward proposals for child protection
The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), in the wake soaring incidents of child abuses cases in the country, yesterday said the authority submitted proposals which address shortfalls in the legal system and social issues underlying the current situation.
The NCPA said child protection is the responsibility of civil society at large. "If fathers are given more responsibility for the day today care of their children, it less likely that they will view children in a sexualized way", the NCPA in a press release said.
The authority stressed the need of having a fast track court system at the High Court level to try cases of child abuses expediously. The release:
"The NCPA is deeply saddened by the brutal abuse and murder of the five year old girl in Kotadeniyawa and the number of cases of child sexual abuse reported throughout the years. We propose a long term response to the disturbing incidence of child sexual abuse which addresses both the serious shortfalls in our legal system and the many social issues underlying the current situation.
"In terms of the legal system, the priority is the effective and expeditious implementation of the law. First, it is necessary to establish a fast-track court system at the High Court level, to try cases of child abuse expeditiously; currently these cases can take eight years or more.
"Second, it is necessary to clear the large backlog of cases stuck at the High Court and the Attorney General's Department, possibly by establishing additional High Courts per province and providing additional resources to the Attorney General's Department.
"Third, sentencing policy for child abuse cases has to be re-evaluated to ensure the mandatory imposition of the minimum punishment prescribed for cases of child abuse in terms of the Penal Code and sentencing policy guidelines have to be developed. It is necessary to review the provisions of the Bail Act and consider amending it to make child abuse offences non-bailable.
"Fourth, all services dealing with children - including the police, probationary and child care services, the Attorney General's Department, and Courts - should have professional, specialized, and independent child focused divisions free from undue political influence. For example, the Women and Children's Bureau of the Police Department should be restructured by converting it into a Division, under a senior DIG at Police Headquarters with branches at Provincial, District, and Divisional levels with non-transferable officers.
"Officers should speak the language of the area in which they are stationed and be highly trained in collection of evidence, investigation, engaging with women and children, and have affiliated medical personnel who will assist with examination of the victim and be equipped with technology tools like DNA collection and analysis kits.
"We have to find effective ways to address the many social issues that cause or contribute to the incidence of child abuse. We have to deepen our understanding of how sexuality operates within our socio cultural context and refine our interventions to have more impact. The NCPA intends to commission research on this. There has to be a co-ordinated effort from all sectors ofthe government to ensure that the most disadvantaged children and those most at risk are identified and monitored and that they, their families, and communities have access to necessary education, health, social, protective, and other services.
"We have to move away from cultural norms that view child rearing as a woman's responsibility. Most child abuse happens at the hands of a male family member, friend, or acquaintance. It is important that we change the way that men view children. If fathers are given more responsibility for the day to day care of their children, it is less likely that they will view children in a sexualized way. As a society, we must be willing to devote more financial, human, and other resources to strengthening communities, reducing violence and drug and alcohol addiction, introducing relationship and sex education into our school curriculum, to name a few actions, and thus ensuring the protection of our children."

Obama greets Xi with 'ni hao' and superpower supper
US: President Barack Obama offered Xi Jinping a warm welcome at the White House on Thursday, greeting his Chinese counterpart with a "ni hao," or hello, at the start of a tricky state visit.
The pair kicked off Xi's first state visit by shedding their ties and strolling out of the West Wing and across Pennsylvania Avenue to Blair House.
Officials hope that by starting with a casual meeting the leaders of the world's two pre-eminent military and economic powers will find time for a less staid exchange of views.
On Friday, Xi will be offered a 21-gun salute and ceremonial state dinner in a symbolic statement that will let him show the Chinese people that he and his country are being treated as a great power.
But US officials admit the litany of problems now plaguing US-China relations and doubts over Xi's commitment to a "peaceful rise" are unlikely to be resolved over butter-poached Maine lobster or grilled cannon of Colorado lamb.
"Far and away, the most constructive engagements they've had have been in their private dinners," said senior Obama national security aide Ben Rhodes.
Thursday's informal dinner is an opportunity, Rhodes said, to "put aside the talking points and actually get a window into one another's world view."
"And those world views are very different. And that's part of why I think the conversations are useful and important, because it provides a context for all these issues."
Xi -- who kicked off his US visit in Seattle, meeting with top corporate CEOs -- is seen in Washington as one of the strongest Chinese leaders in decades, consolidating political, military and government power at a speed not seen since Deng Xiaoping.
Even as the Chinese economy has slowed -- calling into question Xi and the Communist Party's technocratic bona fides -- the president has tightened his grip on power at home.
But his assertiveness has prompted serious maritime, economic and cybersecurity disputes that US officials say risk throwing a complex and delicately balanced relationship out of kilter.
"At any one time we are cooperating and competing," said one senior administration official, who asked not to be named.
"What we strive for is to make sure that competition doesn't define the relationship and that competition is taking place in a way that is healthy and is fair."
At previous summits, agreements on climate change, trade and military cooperation have helped emphasize the positives in US-China relations.
"China will confirm for the first time that it will launch a national emissions trading system, an ETS or a cap-and-trade system in 2017," said another senior administration official.
That could help limit emissions in a country that is one of the world's largest polluters.
Major breakthroughs are unlikely this time round, though, although an agreement on cyber security has not been ruled out.
"I don't think in this state visit you will see really attention-grabbing announcements," said a US official.
Obama and Xi will look to highlight cooperation to curb Iran and North Korea's nuclear programmes, efforts to tackle climate change and people-to-people ties.
An agreement is also expected to limit the risk of dangerous air-to-air military encounters.
On the eve of Xi's visit, US officials revealed that two Chinese fighter jets had passed dangerously close to an American spy plane in international airspace over the Yellow Sea.
But such agreements just treat the symptoms, according to Michael Green, a former National Security Council official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "The larger challenge, the harder question that the administration's deferring on is, if the Chinese behaviour continues and the most we can get are important but essentially Band-Aid cures for some of the symptoms, at what point does the US have to consider imposing costs," he said.
A series of cyber hacks and Beijing's forcible occupation of disputed territory in the South China Sea have prompted the Obama administration to send a message that these costs may come soon if Xi's response is unsatisfactory.
"We have serious and fundamental concerns with Chinese state-sponsored cyber-enabled economic theft of our companies' intellectual property and trade secrets, for the benefit of Chinese companies," a senior administration official told AFP. "The president has raised this a number of times with Xi, as have officials. We expect to see action. We will not hesitate to take the steps necessary to protect our economy and our companies," the official said.
"This is not a minor irritant. It gets at the heart of our economy. It's a national security and economic security issue. It's of critical strategic importance.

Ranil's call for domestic mechanism counters MR's hybrid rejection
The major political debate today is about UNHRC's latest report on the Sri Lankan situation. It is not surprising that the new MP from the Kurunegala District, Mahinda Rajapaksa, has called for its total rejection. This has been the pattern of Sri Lanka's reaction to UNHRC resolutions relating to this country from 2011, which is what has, in large measure, contributed to the assessments, criticisms and recommendations made in the current report.
It is encouraging that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, has said in no uncertain terms that Sri Lanka will only agree to a domestic mechanism to investigate and take action, if necessary, on any matters where such action is needed. When the call for a "hybrid mechanism" for such an investigation has been made by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, this statement by the Prime Minister puts the debate in the correct perspective, encouraging better debate.
In a confused and tedious response, Mahinda Rajapaksa states his government did not cooperate with the UNHRC investigation mainly because it was instituted outside the established procedure of the UNHRC. The question that arises is what on earth the Sri Lankan Foreign Service was doing to ensure the appropriate procedure was followed. One is aware that our representative in Geneva, who remains unchanged, tried his best to see that Sri Lanka displayed the proper attitude towards participation with the UN and its agencies. However, those in the Ministry of External Affairs did not think of any such policy, except for hybrid responses.
Futile effort
What the Rajapaksa administration did was to push ahead with rejection, while in a futile effort to build strength in the UN with new diplomatic links with African countries, refusing to look at any improvements within Sri Lanka to meet the expectations of the international community, which does not mean that we had to (or have to) give in at every stage to US and EU pressure on matters of national importance.
There are reports that the lobbies in Geneva pressing for an even stronger call for an international investigation into the Sri Lankan situation, will make every effort to obtain support from the countries of the EU for something stronger than the proposed "hybrid mechanism". It will be useful for the countries of the EU approached in this regard, to note that the UNHRC report has also made strong charges against the LTTE, for what it refers to as alleged human rights violations, alleged war crimes, and violations of humanitarian law. The EU countries in focus should be aware that these pressure groups remain committed to the separatist terrorism of the LTTE, with not even a minimum acceptance of the process of reconciliation.
The verbose call for rejection of the UNHRC report by Mahinda Rajapaksa also questions the Independence of the OHCHR because it is not funded by the UN, but rather through "voluntary contributions" from Western states that have sponsored resolutions against Sri Lanka, and that the staff positions in the OHCHR are largely held by Westerners. This is hardly the response one would expect from a former Head of State of Sri Lanka, who has been associated with, and also contributed to the current crisis very much, during his period in office, both in the final stages of the war against the LTTE, and especially after its defeat in May 2009.
SLFP and LLRC
Even if one is to agree with this thinking of Mahinda Rajapaksa, who for official purposes remains a prominent member of the SLFP, the leader of which is the President of this country, there is yet an important question to ask both him and the SLFP, as to the failure of his government to implement the most acceptable recommendations of the Lessons Learnt an Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), which was appointed by him, and submitted a far reaching report with enough time for good and effective implementation. One recalls here the observation by the leading SLFP member, and then Leader of the House, Nimal Siripala de Silva, and informing Parliament that the Government is not bound to implement the LLRC recommendations, although it was government appointed Commission. Subsequent events show that this was the thinking of Mahinda Rajapaksa and his government, on matters that were vital for post-war reconciliation, foreign relations and proper governance of Sri Lanka.
The continued rejection of international opinion, brought forward in the reports and resolutions of the UNHRC, the failure of the then government to take adequate steps towards reconciliation within the country, to improve the image of the county abroad, and failure to implement the recommendations of its own LLRC, are in fact the issues that continue to haunt the country today. The result is Sri Lanka now having to face the issue of a "hybrid mechanism" and the necessity to ensure a domestic mechanism for any future probe into these matters.
This has come about as a result of the previous government playing politics with this issue, in the belief that rejection of the UN resolutions, cheating or hoodwinking UN institutions, and talking about unreal dangers to the Head of State, would bring it more popularity and help support the government continue its policies of corruption, nepotism and disregard for law and order, and good governance.
Shame of the past
There are questions being raised today about the United States changing its position on the nature of the inquiry into the Sri Lankan situation from a "domestic mechanism" to a "hybrid mechanism", despite assurances by the US Secretary of State John Kerry and Assistant Secretary of State, Nisha Biswal very much in favour of a domestic mechanism. President Sirisena, in his first meeting with the media in April this year, made it clear the government was working on a domestic mechanism. The nature of this was conveyed to the UN HC on Human Rights Zeid Ra'al Al Hussein.
What is important to know is that the UNHRC's report was not written by the US, whatever the allusions to a western conspiracy by Mahinda Rajapaksa and his supporters. It is true that the US representatives saw the changes in Sri Lanka after January 8, and were ready to express satisfaction at the steps taken towards good governance and reconciliation, with the promise of more in the future.
Yet, there is a larger reality of the immediate history of Sri Lanka, the extended pre-January 8 period of nearly a decade, which would have influenced the UNHRC report that calls for a hybrid mechanism. These are the shameful realities of the past, especially with regard to the rise in control and influence over the judiciary, displayed to the world, especially during the Rajapaksa period.
It would not be possible for those making any study of Sri Lanka, especially with regard to judicial independence, to close their eyes to the manner the last Chief Justice of the country, Justice Shirani Bandaranayake, was removed through a highly manipulated Select Committee of Parliament, the outright rejection of the Court of Appeal judgments against what took place, and the appointment of her "successor" Mr. Mohan Peiris. These are stand outs in the ugly nature of the Sri Lankan judiciary, which will create the worst impressions about the country, not easily erased by the changes after January 8.
It is necessary to go even further to look at the decline of the independence of our judiciary, which began when Justice Mark Fernando was not appointed Chief Justice, which was his due. The later appointment of Justice Sarath N Silva, as Chief Justice, certainly adds to this bad record. Those who did any studies on Sri Lanka's recent judicial tradition could not have missed his judgment in Mahinda Rajapaksa's Helping Hambantota issue. This was brought to the limelight by Sarath Silva himself in the campaign for the election of Maithripala Sirisena as President in the January 8 polls; and also how the same Sarath Silva switched sides to support MR to be Prime Minister in the August 17 general election. Apart from these highlights of a bad judicial record, there remain questions about the judiciary, when one considers recent questions in Parliament.
Another aspect that would not have missed the UNHRC is the behaviour of our Parliament, which saw its worst period after January 8, when the world was looking at Sri Lanka with better tinted glasses than the dark tint of the past.
The behaviour of the majority of MPs in Parliament at that time, are not matters that give any good marks to Sri Lanka. One must also realize that the current 'hybrid coalition' - bartered through Cabinet office, is not the best example of good democracy.
We are caught in a hybrid political combination of the good and the bad, the past and the present. It is now the overall task of the political leadership to work out a domestic mechanism for good governance, as we call for a domestic mechanism with best safeguards for sovereignty and democracy, to handle what ultimately comes from Geneva on September 30th.

56th anniversary of Bandaranaike assassination
'SWRD saga'
Young SWRD, on his return from Oxford, England in 1925, professed the case for a federal structure for Sri Lanka, and made it the main slogan when he formed a political party named, Progressive Nationalist Party, one of the pioneering efforts in the island, though his passion for the concept cooled to some extent over the years. Writing a series of six articles to Ceylon Morning Leader in May - June 1926, Bandaranaike, not only argued for a Federal structure, he also spoke in favour of what he called External Federation, meaning, Ceylon as a unit or a state in a wider regional federation of states.
West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike joined Christ Church College, Oxford in 1919. A year later studying Classics for his Bachelor's degree, he was allotted a room to be shared with Anthony Eden, who later became Prime Minister of England.
From Classics he switched to Law and became an active member of student's union making eloquent speeches on democracy, government's policies and Parliamentary system. Bandaranaike became Secretary of the Oxford Union in his fourth year.
SWRD's political life and times has received immense publicity; volumes authored by political analysts are available in print; so much spoken of his policies and governance - but little on his formative years; before we take up on his vision of Federalism in detail now for a quick glance at his ancestry and childhood.
Bandaranaike ancestry
Named 'West Ridgway' after his God father and Governor of Ceylon, Sir Joseph West Ridgeway, he was born to anglophile Christian aristocratic family and was affectionately called 'Solla', among family circles, and 'Banda' to political colleagues and press.
In her work, 'Relative Merits': 'A Personal Memoir of the Bandaranaike Family of Sri Lanka' (C.Hurst & Co, London-1986); Yasmine Gooneratne, -nee Bandaranaike, traces the ancestry of Dias Bandaranaikes and describes how an Indian officer 'of high standing' migrated in the 16th century, served under the Kings of Kandy. He bore the name Neela-Perumal, and was made high priest of the Temple dedicated to God Saman, and commanded to take the name of 'Nayaka Pandaram' in 1454, meaning chief record-keeper. 'For convenience in usage, it became 'Pandara Nayake', with times, the P was substituted with locally palatable B; thus 'Bandara Nayake', later evolved as Bandaranayake. "The Pandarams, Brahmins of India are the record keepers of Court and family", added, Gooneratne.
After an affluent, lonesome childhood surrounded only some of the time by a disturbed family, he was sent to St Thomas' College, (and he moved into Warden's bungalow instead of Hostel) for his secondary education. Back in the island from Oxford SWRD entered politics which brought him in touch with with the leaders of powerful elite and interests and ultimately with more modest, local level men who presented him with links to masses or under-privileged villagers. State conducted its affairs entirely in English and only eight percent of adult population was literate. His own family enjoyed pride of place among island's British rulers and a small group of wealthy, high caste, highly westernized, Christian elite. This was a sophisticated ensemble, under whose hands power lay when West Ridgeway launched his political carrier later playing the pivotal role in nation's modern transformation.
He rejected the legality of British rule, compelling him to deny his father's role as a staunch supporter of the Colonial regime; he sustained an uncomfortable truce with colonial administrators. However, the leading nationalists of the day were suspicious of the young man whose father and ancestors have ridiculed them. From 1936 he served in a Cabinet of ministers led by D S Senanayake, the designer of independence in 1948, a chapter that ended when DS and his men made sure the exit of SWRD from independent Ceylon's Cabinet in 1951. SWRD changed his faith and thinking subsequently. He possessed, to some extent, socialist leanings, paradoxically became extremely perceptive to Sinhala-Buddhist aspirations in later years.
Case for a Federal Structure
When SWRD began his practice as a lawyer in 1926, the political arena was dominated by CNC. Demand for representative form of government emerged with minorities in the CNC agitating for a Constitution and a future political structure based on regional devolution of power. The first three paragraphs of his first article in Ceylon Morning Leader indicates his vision for the country, when he said.
"At a time when the desire for self-government appears to be growing ever stronger, and successive installments of 'reforms' seem to bring that goal almost within sight, two problems of vital importance arise, which require careful and earnest thought. The first is the question of Ceylon's external status, that is what is her position as a nation in relation to other nations. The second is her internal status, the adoption of a form of government which would meet the just requirements of the different sections of her inhabitants.
No effort has yet been made seriously to consider these problems, nor indeed in some quarters is it realized that the problem exist at all! There is the usual vague thinking, there are the usual generalizations, to which politicians are only too liable, the catch-words are the bane of politicians all over the world... in Ceylon we find in constant use, such phrases as "co-operation," "self-government," Cabinet-government," without any clear understanding of either what they really involve or whether and to what extent, they are applicable to our own particular difficulties.
The writer believes the true solution of the problem mentioned is contained in the federal system, and these articles are intended as a GENERAL INTRODUCTION to the subject..."
- SWRD Bandaranaike (Ceylon Morning Leader - May 19, 1926)
His proposals for internal federation or a federal structure for Ceylon were outlined in a lecture he delivered in Jaffna entitled, "A federal government for Ceylon" on July 17, 1926. His model was based on structures in South Africa, Australia, Canada and Switzerland. However, the six articles dealt in detail the idea of an 'External Federation', more than with a federal structure for Ceylon's government.
Ceylon National Congress (CNC) and Tamil Opinion
Bandaranaike was a member of that category of Asian and African politicians who steered their countries over the transition from colonial rule to freedom and helped to introduce and develop new forms of politics. It is more fitting to include SWRD's name in a list of second generation post-independent leaders, who followed the first generation men like, Sukharno, Nkrumah, Nehru, Nasser, Nyerere and Lulumba.
A man who had been brought up a Christian amid luxury at the summit of social order, and studied at Oxford, and yet he had abandoned the costly passions, past times, food and drinks of the anglicized privileged class, and of a comfortable life as a government top official and heir of the family estate. He chose now to live simply, and had taken up the language, the religion and the cause of the ordinary man, (but did not lose his interest in Tennis). He made pronouncement on Sinhala-Buddhist cultural heritage. His comments appeased the thoughts of weakness among the locals who were reassured that a man with Western intellect and education, found their much maligned cultural tradition as rich and valuable as that of the West. As Prime Minster he spoke of present age of transition and of progress towards a better world, and his government sought to enact numerous reforms.
'Whatever may be said of Bandaranaike, he was no flat, one-dimensional character. This is hardly surprising, since to be a colonial is to be pray to contradictions and counter pressures; to be torn between things local and things cosmopolitan, between Asian and European perceptions, between anti-colonialism and British values and ways, add to that Bandaranaike's own highly complex personality and the result is a life that was a tangle of incongruities.' - James Manor; Biographer- 'The Expedient Utopian: Bandaranaike and Ceylon'- Cambridge (1989)
In the 1930s and 1940s SWRD had turned from federalism to decentralization (Provincial Councils). As minister of local administration 1936-47, he advocated a system of PCs as Nation's local government system. However, Bandaranaike failed to take advantage of the consensus of the State Councilors to this in 1940.
The period 1940/41 were tricky ones for him; he could have been fired by Governor Caldecott for his indiscreet comments on war efforts; legislation was being considered at London's Colonial office for this purpose when his father, the Maha Mudaliyar intervened and appealed to the Governor on his behalf.
This incident caused him to adjust his interest from devolution to succession to the leadership. D B Jayatillake was aging and DS was the obvious choice for replacement. SWRD was thinking of consolidating his position as number two. He was building up his Sinhala Maha Sabha for the purpose.
Thus a great opportunity was lost; PCs that received unanimous approval at State Council for establishing them never saw the light of the day.
Was Bandaranaike 'An Expedient Utopian'
Biographer, James Manor, titled his book on SWRD, 'The expedient utopian: Bandaranaike and Ceylon'. Bandaranaike's commitment to regional councils continued after the independence.
A combined power of Sanga-Veda-Guru-Govi-Kamkaru, ('Buddhist clergy, Ayurvedic physicians, teachers, peasants and workers') organized under SLFP's 'Pancha Maha Balavegaya', who steadfastly supported SWRD Bandaranaike to power at 1956 elections. Some of the stalwarts of this group were impatient; they have been pressing for quick action in effecting changes, while others expected special patronage on dealings. Bandaranaike was obliged to accomplish the common man's requests and the nationalist force's objectives, and the force applied by them for speedy results, are evident in the following statement by his official secretary.
"SWRD, correctly surmised that the average bureaucrat mostly carried out faithfully,... therefore, somewhat slower than his followers expected, shifting out of those who they felt were 'henchmen' of the former regime. ...I once heard him, "I have only just taken control of the wheel. I can't, my dear fellow change all the parts at the same time or I won't be able to move at all. I will replace the brake first,...carburetor next and so on ... you must give me time". - - 'Rendering unto Caesar'- Bradman Weerakoon, UK (2004)-pp 22/23.
The Western form of thought and habits were changed with introduction of local traditional practices. In many instances, SWRD had to settle personal disputes policy issues within members of the party. An unprecedented 'Cabinet strike' orchestrated by Health Minister, Wimala Wijewardene, (who was named 6th suspect in the murder case) was a catastrophe he faced during his relatively short rule of 1956-59. SWRD understood the importance of correcting unfairness and injustice caused to minorities over his Official Language act; through an enactment called, 'Reasonable use of Tamil as a working language', a result of a pact with SJV Chelvanayakam, his school mate and leader of main Tamil party, (Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact of '58); but was forced to abrogate it following an enormous protest planned by his five-fold Sinhala-Buddhist chauvinists opposite his residence, while the United National Party, organised island-wide movement against it.
Conspiracy and murder
Some of the Sangha-Veda, (Buddhist priests and Aryuvedic physicians), the first two categories of Pancha Maha Balavegaya that elevated Bandaranaike to the zenith, had him murdered when he denied them of special state favours for their nefarious activities.
Head of Kelaniya temple, Mapitigama Buddharakkitha was one of the main architects of SWRD's election campaign and victory, he wanted to import rice from Burma through his shipping company, to which two senior Cabinet ministers opposed. The Prime Minister appreciated his minister's advice. Tenders were called for purchase of two ships - the priest attempted to obtain the tender through his influence. PM absolved himself from interfering in the affair. The disgruntled man conspired with, H P Jayawardene, an Aryuvedic physician from Kolonnawa, also a staunched supporter of SLFP. They connived with Somarama, an Aryuvedic lecture, and an extremist Sinhala nationalist, by impregnating in him the idea that SWRD is a traitor who is planning to 'sell the Sinhala nation and race to Federalist Chelvanayakam: Somarama was convinced.'
A murder of a political leader was an unusual happening in the island nation until 1959, when the Prime Minster was shot on September 25, and the reasons that prompted and forced the conspiracy, and the cold-blooded assassination denotes a remarkable transformation of political and cultural environment, in Ceylon.
"...that morning, I went to Rosmead Place, the Prime Minister was talking to another monk. I occupied a seat at the end of the verandah, and then he came up to me and inquired why I had come ...I shot at the Prime Minister once. That shot struck him. He started running into the house, I followed behind him and fired three more bullets. Someone shot me as well and I lost consciousness. I do not remember what happened next".

Ticket sales break new records with World Cup proving to be the sport's biggest ever
Rugby World Cup ticket sales hit a record 2.35million on Wednesday night to further England 2015's claims that this year's tournament is already the sport's biggest ever.
Just six days after kick-off at Twickenham in the opener between England and Fiji last week, this Rugby World Cup is already outstripping every previous edition in almost every quantifiable way.
Only four per cent of the total tickets remain on sale, with 100,000 more sold than the previous record-breaking tournament in France eight years ago, while corporate sales have even outstripped the London 2012 Olympics.
Among the other records broken include the one for a World Cup attendance, smashed by the 89,019 who turned out to watch New Zealand vs Argentina at Wembley on Sunday, television viewing figures and commercial revenues.
ITV's coverage push has seen ratings-leader the X Factor moved to accommodate rugby's Saturday night game, with audiences of 10-15m expected, and more records will be broken when international figures are analysed.
Just 14 of the remaining matches having tickets left available, and only one of those is ranked as having more than 'limited availability' in the higher price categories by tournament organisers.
Corporate packages for the final next month, priced from 2,495 per person, remain on sale but will certainly sell out to boost the tournament's overall turnover to more than 100m after corporate sales exceeded those for the London Olympics by 50 per cent.
However, fans are still unhappy with pricing levels surrounding the matches across the country. The most expensive tickets are still available for many games, while pints of Heineken at stadiums and in the Fan Zones are priced at 5.
Matchday programmes for each fixture cost 10 and the average ticket is sold at 104.17. DAILY MAIL

TNA welcomes draft resolution on Sri Lanka
The Tamil National Alliance welcomes the draft text of a resolution on Sri Lanka tabled by the co-sponsors of the resolution yesterday.
"In particular, we welcome the draft resolution's call on Sri Lanka to involve foreign and Commonwealth judges, lawyers, investigators and defenders in a judicial mechanism to be set up in Sri Lanka that would be mandated to try international crimes," the TNA said in a statement.
The statement added: "This constitutes a significant victory for justice in Sri Lanka. The TNA is committed to help the government and international stakeholders evolve such a court, and will support its work. We also wish to note our appreciation of the government's assent to this text and its willingness to co-sponsor it in the Human Rights Council.
"A court established on these lines would represent a dramatic break from the past and could herald the beginning of an end to impunity.
"The draft resolution tabled today was the product of a difficult consensus.
We are acutely aware that some of the language used in the interests of a consensus will not satisfy all victims of the conflict whom we represent and who have reposed their trust in the TNA. However, we are of the view that the draft provides a constructive starting point for what will inevitably be a long road to reconciliation.
"We thank the co-sponsors and all other government and non-government stakeholders who stayed true to their convictions, and recognize that the hard work of implementing the government's commitments and winning back the trust of victims begins now. The TNA stands ready to support such efforts."

Witnesses blame Saudi officials for Hajj horror
SAUDI ARABIA: Witnesses to a stampede that left more than 700 people dead at the Hajj in Saudi Arabia on Thursday blamed Saudi authorities and said they were afraid to continue the rituals.
The worst tragedy in 25 years at the annual Muslim pilgrimage occurred during the symbolic stoning of the devil at Mina, just outside the holy city of Mecca.
At least 717 people were killed and 863 people were hurt, spurring King Salman to order "a revision" of Hajj organisation while authorities started a probe into the disaster.
One minister blamed the pilgrims for the tragedy, but worshippers disagreed.
"There was crowding. The police had closed all entrances and exits to the pilgrims' camp, leaving only one," said Ahmed Abu Bakr, a 45-year-old Libyan who escaped the stampede with his mother.
"I saw dead bodies in front of me and injuries and suffocation. We removed the victims with the police."
He added that police at the scene appeared inexperienced.
"They don't even know the roads and the places around here," he said as others nodded in agreement.
Pilgrims in Mina stay in a complex of white fireproof tents big enough to hold more than two million people, and the interior ministry said it deployed 100,000 police to secure the Hajj, maintain safety and manage traffic and crowds.
One outspoken critic of redevelopment at the holy sites said despite the large numbers, police were not properly trained and lacked the language skills for communicating with foreign pilgrims, who make up the majority of those on the Hajj.
"They don't have a clue how to engage with these people," said Irfan al-Alawi, co-founder of the Mecca-based Islamic Heritage Research Foundation.
"There's no crowd control," Alawi said.
Another witness, 39-year-old Egyptian Mohammed Hasan, voiced worries that a similar incident "could happen again".
"You just find soldiers gathered in one place doing nothing," he said.
He also alleged that he had been insulted because of his nationality, when security men asked him to "come identify this Egyptian corpse".
"Why are they humiliating us like this We are coming as pilgrims asking for nothing," Hasan said angrily, urging the security forces to "organise the roads" to ensure the smooth movement of people.

World accepts our commitment to democracy - PM
The resolution on Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, co-sponsored by the government and member States, is an ample testimony that the world had accepted our commitment to democracy, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was addressing the 50th Anniversary celebrations of CIMA Sri Lanka at Colombo recently.
"We no longer need to face the pressures that we had been facing for the past five to six years as the world had accepted that we are building a democratic society," the Prime Minister said.
He said the government had agreed to a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, under the country's own judicial framework that will include the office of a special counsel, which will investigate alleged human rights violations.
"They will certainly have the support of not only Sri Lankan but also Commonwealth and foreign judges and lawyers. But all this has to be authorized under Sri Lankan law," the Premier said.
He added that measures will be taken according to and under the Sri Lankan Constitution.
"One of the biggest issues faced by our country for the last five to six years has been removed. Now we can face the future with confidence," Premier Wickremesinghe said.
He said there had been great fear that the country would have to face economic sanctions as a result of international action.
The Prime Minister told CIMA officials: "You have a vital role to play in creating a million jobs, in making Sri Lanka a highly competitive market economy, in raising the income of the people, creating a strong middle class and uplifting our rural economy."
CIMA Global President Myriam Madden said Sri Lanka is now developing at a rapid pace and its growth is encouraging. "CIMA members contribute to business development in a significant manner as all our members are of high standard with regard to work ethics and discipline," she said.
"At present, Sri Lanka has over 13,000 CIMA students, 4,000 members and another 1,500 members outside the country. They can play an important role for the country's economic development," she said.
Over 60 percent of students are women. This can be a role model for other countries. CIMA is a global qualification. Most Sri Lankans, including women, hold top positions in the corporate sector, she said.
Ministers, CIMA CEO Charles Tilley, business leaders, past CIMA Presidents and the current leadership participated.
